1369741458.0,127,self.ClashOfClans,1f6zq2,A few tips for farming,enginedriver,130,3,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1f6zq2/a_few_tips_for_farming/,"I've noticed a lot of people saying they can't seem to make any money any more, or that farming isn't working for them. I haven't noticed a problem though so here are a few tips.

* Put your Town Hall outside your walls and your Storages Inside.

This sounds like the simplest thing ever but you'd be amazed the bases I've seen. If you're constantly being raided for as much as you can farm then you need to put your base outside your walls. That 11 hour shield will protect you when you're not around! The problem with a lot of farming raids is they will often not even 1-star you, so you are open to repeated attacks. Putting my Town Hall outside my base was the best thing I ever did.

* Trophies do not matter. 

This is also a simple concept but especially since the league update I think a lot of people feel the need to climb the trophy count. You really don't. The amount of resources as a bonus you get from a win is really nothing at all and you are much more likely to be attacked the higher up you go. I hover around 1250 and get a decent income.

* Farm the mines whenever you can, and don't be afraid to hit little and often. 

Don't always go out looking for those 300,000 hits because the chances are you're going to lose all your troops. I try to hit little and often, using say a third of my troops to get a quick 50k - 100k grab and move on. You'll be amazed how much you can accumulate. People often think the 40k gold isn't work raiding and move on, but those stacked up, combined with the fact you can do several of these per barracks-cycle means you'll be up in resources. 

Pay close attention to the collectors and mines and try to go for those when you can as they are always much less defended. If the base has a lower level bank and it's full, the main banks are probably full so beware of these. However, if the mines have gravestones around them usually they're full and that's always a good battle. Don't over-commit. If you're not making most of the money in an attack, quit and don't waste any more troops. 

* Don't use spells unless they have a LOT of money

Each spell costs like 20-25,000  - so what's the point!

* Use a good, fast composition.

I've seen a lot of different compositions but have settled on this:

4 Giants
4 Wall Breakers
Half Archers
Half Goblins

Why only 4 Giants and 4 Wallbreakers? Well you ideally want enough giants to tank for the wallbreakers. They are not there to destroy anything. And it takes 2 wallbreakers to get a pink wall down, so that's the minimum you can get away with. 4 wallbreakers will get to the inside of most bases as long as they path right.

Why archers AND goblins? Well the archers are used to pick off anything they can from range, and then take the first few hits for the goblins. Either used on their own suck pretty bad for farming. I like to do a line of archers then a line of goblins. If there are buildings in the way let the archers take down those buildings then put in a line of goblins as the archers take that first volley of defenses. 

You want the fastest barracks-cycle possible to keep the money up, so I put 1 Giant, 1 Wallbreaker and either rest goblins or archers on each of my barracks. That way they all finish at the same time and it only takes like 20 minutes. You don't need to go mad raiding all day though.

*  Pick your targets wisely

So many people play this game, it's not worth attacking someone you don't think you'll win against. Just move on. It doesn't cost much skipping so do it a lot!

Here's 1 barracks-cycle of attacks:

http://imgur.com/WWp4ONV

Note the timelog. I managed to farm:

452,845 Gold
438,571 Drank

In one cycle. I pretty much just targetted bases that had all the resources in the mines. You don't always find these of course, but it's worth looking. I'm currently at around 1300 trophies.

Additionally here's my defense log for today:

http://imgur.com/jA69kW8

1371524694.0,85,self.ClashOfClans,1gk89i,Quick explanation on why some people are so upset at Supercell,MerliSYD,98,13,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1gk89i/quick_explanation_on_why_some_people_are_so_upset/,"So one of my clan members rage quit last night, and it's pretty obvious that there are a lot of people upset at Supercell.

I'm going to try and explain to those of you who don't understand why everyone is so upset.

What you will find, is that a large percentage of those people rage quitting are 

* those who have been playing for a long time, or
* people who have spent a fair bit of money on the game (a few hundred dollars)

So..... Why the heck are they so upset?

Well when I first started playing, Level 8 (black skull walls) were the top walls, at 500,000 gold a piece. When you were a TH Level 1,2,3,etc... that was a tremendous price for a single piece of wall, but given time, we could see ourselves getting there.

Then on January 11th 2013, Supercell released an update 3.3 with Level 9 and 10 walls at 1 million and 3 million per piece. This upset a lot of players as their goal posts just got moved a tremendous distance away from them.... 

Imagine running a marathon, getting to the 35km mark and then being told the goal posts have been moved to 150km away. Yup. Literally.

Resigned to their fate, players kept grinding away, farming and spending more on gems to try and keep up, while the top 2-3% (guesstimate) just simply gemmed their way there instantly.

Not even 6 months later, Supercell release update 4.53 on 17th June 2013, and added ANOTHER level of walls at a cost of 4 million per piece.

----------  
Welcome to my Clash of Clans Strategy Guide. If you're just interested in the good stuff, skip down to below. Still with me? Good stuff. I'm starting this guide so I don't need to keep writing out the same suggestions for people when they want their bases reviewed. I'll still give specific details, but now I'll be able to link them to one place. Eventually this guide will probably be on the Reddit Wiki system, once it is released. Please do not post this guide without permission (just PM me and ask) and without crediting me. 

I'll try to keep updating this guide, and I'll try to keep it not so wordy, and have images, especially in the beginner chapters. Please excuse my [lack of] MSPaint skills. If you have advice, images, comments, suggestions of your own, please feel free to comment and I'll incorporate them.

**1.1: How to Defend your Defenses**   
[Average](http://imgur.com/5a2LW) - [Decent](http://imgur.com/N4Zb5) -  [Best](http://imgur.com/7lLxB)

Walls are good. But walls are not the only part in a super awesome base. The #1 mistake I see new players (or not so new players) doing is placing their defenses so they can be targeted by archers spawning outside of the walls. Don't make this mistake.  
The difference between 'Decent' and 'Great' has to do with the way units decide which building to attack next. It it too complicated to get into here (this 'basics' section) but I think I'll cover it later in more detail.  
The buildings protecting your defenses do matter - Mines/collectors will have more HP than Barracks/Builder's Huts.

**1.1.1: Oh God! Enemies Can Spawn There Too?!**  
[Not good!](http://imgur.com/kq4mu) [Unless it's your enemy!](http://i.imgur.com/3fXQF.jpg) from [wadely](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/114eur/clash_of_clans_strategy_guide_chapter_1_base/c6lmg7i)

Yes, enemies can spawn around the ring of your base. No, you can't build there to stop them. 

  
**1.1.2: Holes in bases are bad, mmk?**  

When you move any building or wall (but not decorations, it shows you white lines one space larger in every direction than that building. This is showing you where enemies can spawn. Make sure you don't have any holes in your base to let them spawn inside your walls. That would be bad. I will write about how to leave *intentional* spawn spots in your base later, in the advanced base defense chapter. 

**1.2: Overlapping Defenses**   
[Not Good.](http://imgur.com/Hn7oP)

Another common mistake is placing all of your defenses widely spread apart to cover as many buildings as possible. Dies very easily to several giants. Or to groups of infantry, especially archers. Or to balloons. Which I guess it means it just dies to everything. This often goes along with 'Trying to stuff everything inside your walls' covered later. 

**1.3: Splash Damage: It's your friend!**  

Mortars (and later wizard towers) are your first and last line of defense against mass infantry attacks. A mortar's damage is only limited by how many troops your enemy puts down and how well you funnel them into where you want them. A fully upgraded mortar (level 6, total cost 3,752,000 gold) will do 45 damage in one shot to the unit it targets. In the same amount of time (5 seconds) an archer tower (level 1, total cost 1,000 gold) will do 55 damage to the unit it is targeting. What does this mean? It means you need to make sure your splash damage defenses are hitting enemies in groups and are protected. How do you get them to hit enemies in groups? Put then in the middle of your base - As soon as the enemy destroy a wall and funnel through it, they will be nice and  bunched up for the mortars. 

**1.3.1: Where should I place my Mortar?**  

Somewhere very protected. Probably in the middle if your base, ideally with it's own wall around it. 

**1.3.2: Where should I place my Air Defense?**

In the middle of your base. Mass are attacks are rare (due to time to build), but not unheard of. A single, upgraded anti air turret is a wonderful deterrent, but it should be placed in the middle of your base. More specifically, it should be placed such that, if a mass balloon attack comes, It won't be the first, second, or third defense they kill.

**1.4: Don't try to stuff everything inside your walls**  
[Not Good.](http://imgur.com/YHSvB)

As a counter point to 1.2: Overlapping Defenses, don't try to enclose everything within your walls. First off you will often break 1.2: Overlapping Defenses and 1.1: Defend your Defenses by trying to cover everything, but secondly it is just a waste of walls. Double thick walls are better than a massive single thick wall.  

**1.4.1: What should I keep outside my walls?** 

Absolutely keep your builder huts, Laboratory, Barracks, and Spell Factory outside your walls. None of these matter if they get destroyed - no progress or resources are lost.  
Next I would keep out Army camps, and Gold Mines and Elixir Collectors. Each of these has a consequence if they get attacked: Mines/Collectors get resources stolen (but only uncollected resources), and if an army camp dies all troops stationed in it die. Some people really like keeping Mines/Collectors inside - It depends on how often you play. If you do keep a few inside, make sure they are your highest level ones.  
What does that leave? Town Hall, Defenses, Elixir Storage, Gold Storage. All of these should be inside your walls and as protected as possible. If you are at a stage in the game where you don't care about trophies, you can also kick your town hall outside the walls. You will be easy to defeat, but if you're only trying to protect your resources then the town hall takes up a lot of space.

1) A new gold mine and elixir collecter added at THs 7,8,9,10. This would mean that eventually you could end up with 10 mines and collecters which adds 2/3 to your production rate - this gives a total of 30,000 per hour or 720,000 per day for each resource.

These extra resources will allow for much faster gathering whilst also making it easier to steal a few 10s of thousands from someone who is at work or school and more when they are asleep.



2) Additional levels to mines and collecters. By raising their max level to 15 and increasing the rate of resources produced to 5000 per hour this would also increase production by 2/3 and allow for greater quantities to be gained per day without raiding. This would also give 30,000 per hour or 720,000 per day.

This, like number 1, would introduce more resources to the game and so speed it up whilst also adding the incentive to raid people as resources accumalate unprotected whilst the owner is inactive at work, school or asleep.

Should both 1 &amp; 2 be combined then it would allow for 50,000 gold or elixir per hour and 1.2 million per day - a relitavely decent amount for the top players.



3) Take off caps on looting storages but reduce the loot % to 10%. This would enable more loot to be stolen from hoarders and so would encourage people to be active but also allow them to get it all back in one raid.

This would mean for every million resources in the storages, 100,000 could be stolen. Therefore from 4 level 11 storages a total of 800,000 could be stolen if absolutely full. This would give the incentive to heavily protect storages for non-gemmers whilst allowing trophy hunters to trade storages off for people to not attack their base.

However none of these would greatly reduce the number of gems spent as the uprade times are still very long and so many resources can go unprotected for over a week due to the large amount being accumulated in the mines and collecters so people would gem upgrades so that they could use their resources.



Tell me what you think of these ideas as I believe that they could make a much more active and competitive group of people no matter what the trophy range. Alternatively they could raise each league bonus by at least 10x and add dark elixir at gold 1 which would negate the need for any of the above.",,False,self,t5_2usfk,False,,reddit-clan clan-Rho,True,t3_1gn5qk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1gn5qk/how_to_balance_the_very_expensive_upgrade_costs/,

1371603964.0,70,self.ClashOfClans,1gmhto,For all those OUTRAGED at the update,timlomsie,90,20,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1gmhto/for_all_those_outraged_at_the_update/,"A lot of people are very upset over the recent update and to be honest I'm not thrilled either. But instead of rage quitting and blaming Supercell's 'greed' why not wait a second and think about what is going on at large here.

Many are citing [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2013/04/18/the-2-4-million-per-day-company-supercell/) article in Forbes to Supercell's $2.4M revenue flow per day as to why the game (which is free, may I remind you) should be cheaper.  The logic is, since Supercell is already very profitable they should reduce their prices.  There are many flaws in this logic.

First off, revenue is not net income (how much the company actually takes home). Net income = revenue - expenses. It costs money to run a company and although $2.4M in revenue is an impressive number for such a small team it certainly doesn't mean Supercell is profiting $70M a month.

Also, a short look into cash flows might settle some people down.  Supercell doesn't make $2.4M in revenue EVERYDAY.  That is an average over a period of time.  Their cash flow stream probably looks a lot more skewed, with large inflow of cash occurring right after updates and quickly tapering off far below that $2.4M mark in the following weeks.  Clearly the incentive to stay profitable (when revenue &gt; expenses) will keep updates with new material coming.

With that settled, I'll move on to a more valid critique people have shared, the type of upgrade this was.  Here I've got to admit I was disappointed.  The update's biggest additions were walls and a larger quantity preexisting features (minus the freeze spell which looks cool). I agree, I want to see new content when an update comes out. However, instead of jumping the gun and pointing fingers at 'greedy' Supercell, think about why this update came out.  This will give them a lot of capital to spend on developing new content for the game.  People have begged for 1 on 1 attacks with your friends and Clan vs Clan wars. These are two ideas that are pretty different from the current platform and will take time and money to develop. And with Supercell's [great track record](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/supercell-2/) up to this point, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now.

and finally thanks to Deathlui for motivating me to finish up and post Chapter 2 :) 

----------  

Welcome to Chapter 2. I sure was hoping to get this out a lot sooner than 3 weeks after Chapter 1, but stuff came up (mid terms) and I had some trouble with some tricky stuff (turret range details).  
This chapter is much longer and much more detail oriented than the previous chapter. Where as I was trying to make Chapter 1: Base Defense, The Basics accessible to anyone, this chapter gets into the nitty gritty details which is probably more useful only at the higher levels of both gameplay and dedication. As such, it truly is a Wall Of Text™. I did still leave out some details that I thought were getting too specific, so if you want to know *why* I recommend something feel free to ask in the comments, PM me on reddit, or [ask in clan chat in game](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/126ijl/official_subreddit_clans_thread/) of the clan I recently set up with the last patch. Now, without further ado, Chapter 2: Advanced base Defense!

----------

**2.1 Are you a tempting target?**
The best way to not get attacked is to not make it worth your attacker’s time. There are several things that an attacker will likely attack to get, or not attack due to the presence of.

**2.1.1 Large amounts of Loot!**
Loot is the #1 reason people will attack at low levels. If you don’t have much to steal, you’re safe! Spend as much as you can on walls prior to starting any upgrade. Spend on removing natural decorations when the builder is available. If you don’t have a worker available, start a research project in the Laboratory (elixir) or buy decorations (gold and elixir). Note that gold not collected (in Gold Mine or Elixir Collector) can be stolen. Other ways to spend resources - Queuing units (even when your army camps are full), building spells, starting research, buying defenses (bombs/spring traps), buying decorations (flowers and flags, they will prevent enemy spawning on top of them).

**2.1.2 Having easily accessible loot**
Accessible loot comes in two types - accessible mines/collectors and accessible storage. Both are bad. Make sure your storage is either empty or in the middle of your base. Make sure your mines/collectors are next to your walls (and therefore next to your defenses). Uncollected resources are easier to steal then collected ones - the buildings are more spread out and the buildings have lower HP.

You should also intermix your elixir collections and mines as well as your elixir storage and gold storage. If an opponent really wants your gold, and all of your mines are together in a nice line, it is much more tempting of a target as not as much needs to be invested to steal the single resource they are seeking. Similarly, make sure your two gold storage are not next to one another. 

**2.2 Having a Good Base**
See Chapter 1 for details (Common issues: not protecting your defenses, mortar and air defense placement, everything-inside-walls issue, spread out defenses). Also having defenses that are significantly below the ‘normal’ upgraded amount for your trophy count/level. Here are a few more common bases and what I think of each.

**2.2.1 The Standard Base**
The standard base follows all of the rules laid out in Chapter 1 - Defenses and storage inside of the walls, army camps, barracks, mines, extractors, etc etc etc outside of the walls. There is a single wall dividing your precious base from the hordes of horrors outside. Now What? How can you improve your base? Well this standard base is weak to giants as once they breach your wall, they can attack all of your defenses without delay. It is also weak to mass goblin attacks for the same reason - Once inside they can often outrun splash damage and steal all of your goodies, possibly leaving you with a victory, but with many less resources to spend.

**2.2.2 The Pocketed Base**
This base has the town hall in the center, and every defense around it is surrounded by its’ own 4x4 wall. They are good against giants as the walls slow them down, while keeping the defenses are close together. They are best attacked with giants and archer support.

**2.2.3 The Large Pocketed Base**
This base is a variant on the pocketed base, where each pocket has 2-3 structures in each pocket. It is more efficient in terms of wall usage than the pocketed base, allowing for more buildings to be placed within the walls. People who love symmetry in their bases will like the 3 pocket base, as it creates a nice spiral with no wasted space or walls. The differences between this as the Pocketed base are minimal. This base type is more common than the Pocked Base at lower levels due to lack of walls.

**2.2.4 The Bulkhead Base**
A Bulkhead Base follows the rules laid down in chapter 1 about kicking unneeded buildings outside of the walls, then uses extra walls to segment defenses into different sections allowing for greater protection in case one section is breached (especially by giants). Bulkheads are used in large boats to prevent the entire boat from sinking in case of a leak below the waterline - The flooded sections are closed off via built in bulkheads, containing the flooding to only the affected sections. In the same way, bases use this strategy to contain (or slow) the flood of enemy troops to the breached bulkhead - Where as a single wall a breach would mean your clan is headed to destruction.

**2.2.5 The Split Base**
A somewhat common (but poor) base defense strategy is grouping your defenses into two groups, with critical non-defensive buildings between them (Town Hall, Resource Storage). This defensive strategy seems to not violate the rules I’ve put down in Chapter 1, but it actually violates the rule of keeping your defenses too spread out. Your defenses should be able to cover each other, ideally as much as possible - keeping them in two groups should be avoided. A split base defense is very vulnerable to giant attacks as they can clean up half of the defenses without taking fire from the other half. Split bases also mean that if *either* side is wiped out, your critical buildings in the center are very vulnerable to a few archers attacking from that side, effectively meaning your base is half as weak as otherwise.

**2.3 Funneling for Victory**   
Funneling is critical to getting the best results out of your splash damage dealing turrets. It basically means using buildings (mostly walls) to make your enemy go where you want it to go, and then die as you want it to die. 

[This is how my current base funnels enemies.](http://imgur.com/ryxhc) 

Proper funneling turns [this](http://imgur.com/9WHvS) into [this](http://imgur.com/uMJF0). 

Do I need to say more? Funneling is also critical to proper trap usage. See section 2.11 below.  

**2.4 Upgrading multiple defenses at the same time**
Your defenses don’t attack if they’re in the middle of being upgraded when you’re attacked! Try not to be upgrading 40% of your defenses at the same time. This is doubly true for splash damage buildings (mortar, wizard tower) and air defense.

**2.5 Having a glaring flaw in your base**  
Such as a spawn point where you moved a turret out of but didn’t put anything back. Or not having an air defense turret. Or putting your air defense turret outside of your walls.  

**2.6 Buildings outside walls are too spread out**  
At higher levels, more players start caring about trophies. If an attacker sees your base is easy to 1-star (kill 50% of the buildings) without having to place too many troops they will see you as a good target. Keep your buildings close to your walls (and defenses) to prevent this, if you care about maintaining your trophy count.

**2.7 Turret Range Considerations: What can your towers defend?**  
One of the goals of placing less valuable buildings outside of your walls is to slow down your attackers once they are within range of your defenses. NOT to make them spawn farther back - This is of secondary priority. This section covers what that range actually means. Range in this game is also sorta screwed up - Sometimes a turret will decide it can attack a unit standing in a given square, but on another base (with identical unit and turret placement) it won’t attack. This ambiguity is why it has taken me about 2 weeks longer to post Chapter 2 than I was hoping. I still haven’t figured out why it does this.

What can and can’t be attacked without taking return fire is summarized in these pics.

Archer - Range 4  

**2.8 Spawn Forcing**  
Spawn forcing refers to forcing your opponent to spawn further away from your important buildings, or your base in general.  The objective is to attempt to persuade your opponent to attack from a different side of your base and to delay their reaction time (placing reinforcements).  You can create this gap outside of your base by arranging your exterior buildings, placing extra walls, placing decorations and utilizing natural decorations. It is not recommended to use buildings to force your opponent to spawn further away, as buildings are more useful to delay your opponent once they are in range of your turrets. However, if you spread out your walls in singles (optimal distribution to create a large no-spawn-zone) wall breakers will almost never attack them.  Spawn forcing allows your defenses to kill many wall breakers before they get to your walls if they are unsupported. For other wall breaker defense tips, see decoy walls below. If allowed to spawn directly next to your wall, wall breakers are able to detonate before turrets can strike, even if the wall breaker would normally be one hit by the turret. 

**2.8.1 Trick Spawns**  
Trick spawns are ‘mistakes’ in a spawn forcing situation. Usually a single hole, they are closer to the center of your base the rest of the spawn force allows. However they are intentional and you should make sure you have turrets (especially mortars) barely within range of the spawn square in question.

**2.8.2 Why use trick spawns?**  
Spawn tricks are  fun (I’ve had an opponent put down 31 archers in a trick spawn just to have them all die to a single mortar hit - they didn’t opt to continue attacking). Normally they don’t matter but occasionally they help. If created without care, they can allow your opponent an advantage (such as if they can deploy wall breakers). It is inadvisable to rely on traps to defend a trick spawn - if you get attacked twice in a row they won’t be there the second time, plus a smart attacker will place a single unit in the square in question to test for traps.

**2.9 Messing with Wall Breakers**  
Wall breakers are often used in conjunction with giants to get them through the outer walls faster. Here are a few tips to mess with the Wall Breaker AI.

**2.9.1 Decoy Walls**  
Decoy walls are segments of walls of at least 8 that wall breakers will target if they are closer than your real walls. They can also be used to funnel archers and barbarians into taking lots of splash damage from mortars and wizards. Segments of 7 or less don’t seem to work most of the time (seems to be partially based on spawn proximity). If you do further testing and discover any additional details, please report back (for science).

**2.9.2 Outer walls with Buttresses**  
When used in game they [look like this](http://imgur.com/CVdUs). The wall breaker will attack the buttress rather than the walls. Giants will ignore them and proceed straight to the inner walls. Only once the nearby buttress is destroyed will the Wall Breaker target the main wall. This works especially well with spawn forcing, as the farther away the wall breakers spawns the more likely they will target several buttresses, rather than several targeting one buttress and then the surviving ones re-targeting onto the main wall.  They can also be combined with Decoy Walls - See pictures of my base in the funneling section for how I use them in such a situation.  
If you're curious about the name, buttresses are [these things](http://www.theintellectualdevotional.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/308857676_e8481b9dba.jpg) on churches. They support the walls from outside of the church. 

**2.9.3 Using extra walls for Buffering**  
[Visual of buffering](http://imgur.com/MiCYk)

If you have extra walls you can also use them to protect your defenses from archers. They simple prevent archers from getting close enough to fire, however they do cut down on the number of buildings outside the wall your turret can protect so I generally only recommend this for situations where you 1) DON'T want archers attacking form 2) have walls to spare 3) don't have buildings which can defend your turret instead. This situation can be considered the advanced method of 'Defending your Defenses' (from Chapter 1) but is generally not viable to lower level players due to the number of walls necessary.

All stats are accurate as of the time I recorded them, which is some time within the last two or so hours. The clans towards the end were done last, so will obviously be the clans with the most up-to-date stats! I did try to get it done as quickly as possible to keep the stats as up-to-date as possible, but I am only one man!

This table was designed to give /r/clashofclans users a general overview of each of the official social Reddit clans. I thought this would be useful for people when picking a Reddit clan to join (or hop to, as it were) and just for the amusement of the current members of the Reddit clans to see how each clan compares to the next!
If people take an interest in the table I will update it periodically (once per season would be ideal, but it's quite a bit of effort so I'll do my best).

I hope you all find it informative and/or useful. If there's anything I missed or any feedback I would be happy to hear it.

Frequently Asked Questions
------------

Q: What is the password to join?  
A: Read the rules at the above link.

Q: How to I ""apply"" to join?  
A: Read the instructions at the above link.

Q: The ""join"" button is not avalible!  
A: Leave your clan first

Q: My application was denied!  
A: Either you didn't include the password (see above) or the clan is full. 

Q: The clan wasn't full when I applied!  
A: If two people apply for one open position, only one can get the spot. Often times 5+ people apply for an open position. Sorry. 

Q: When will more clans be added?  
A: As soon as possible. Sorry for the delay. 

Q: Can I apply to lead an official clans?  
A: Yes. [You can apply here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/14l857/modpost_clan_leader_and_subreddit_supporter/) It is recommended you have experience in a Reddit Clan. Immature individuals need not apply. Please read the notice at the top of the thread

Q: Can I join Reddit or Reddit Beta to be with Flammy?  
A: If a spot opens up, yes. However there is a lot of competition for these slots. Also Flammy is really, really lame and never talks in clan chat. 

Q: I want to join a competitive clan, but it is full!  
A: If you meet the requirements and apply, the lowest member will be kicked so you can join. 

Q: I applied to join a competitive clan and was denied! I met the requirements!  
A: Did you beat the 40th member of the clan? This may be higher than the current set minimum, as the minimum can only be set every 100 trophies. Also make sure you included the password. See above. 

Q: My question wasn't answered above!  
A: Read everything above, then you can [send a message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FClashOfClans).",,False,self,t5_2usfk,1371642596.0,,reddit-clan clan-reddit,True,t3_126ijl,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/126ijl/official_subreddit_clans_thread/,moderator

It would bring up a menu  and you can then choose your army composition and then click a button that says ""save army"". You could then have two or three army compositions saved at once, one for farming, trophies and whatever else you can think of. Then later on once you choose to build a saved army it then creates troops to make that army. Say if you want 40 archers as part  of it but you already have 16 for example, it would then make the required number of archers. 

Another thing that this would allow is it would show you the total build time and the cost which both require a fair bit of effort.

----------  

Welcome to Chapter 3, Unit Strengths and AI. This chapter is critical to understand before moving onto other topics such as attacking, and is also important when tweaking your base defense to take advantage of small pathfinding quirks. **This chapter is ordered from the simplest to understand units to the hardest to understand**/the most quirky, not unlock order. You can skip around and read just the units you care about, but I honestly think you will learn more about how the AI works as a whole if you read it in the order I’ve presented it.

I've also tried to include more images in this chapter and - for the first time - videos! Hope you enjoy them. For the Giants and Balloons section, I have 'tests' to practice with - Let me know how you like those, and feel free to create some of your own and post in the comments - we can argue about whose solution right all day. :)

[**Chapter 2: Advanced Base Defense**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/12b5xz/clash_of_clans_strategy_guide_chapter_2_advanced/) 

**Chapter 3: Chapter 3: Unit Strengths, AI, and Pathfinding**

3.1 Unit Strengths  
3.2 Balloons - Target: Defenses   
3.3 Giants - Target: Defenses  &amp; Goblins - Target: Resources  
3.4 Barbarians, Dragons &amp; P.E.K.K.A - Target: Any  
3.5 Archers &amp; Wizards - Target: Any  
3.6 Healers - Target: Any  
3.7 Wall Breakers - Target: Walls  

**3.1 Unit Strengths**  
Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses. The main factors to consider are Combat type (range/melee), Movement type (Air/Ground), Favorite Target (Any, Defenses, Resources, Walls), Damage per Second, Housing Space, and Cost to train. To a lesser degree, you should be aware of each unit’s training time, movement speed. **You can see the details of all units** (not just unlocked ones) **by clicking the “i” symbol on each unit in the barracks.**

Here is a very high level summary of each unit. Any special abilities or quirks will be mentioned in the in depth section below.

|Unit|Strengths, Weakenesses and Notes|
|:------:|:-------------------------------|
|Barbarian| Good health, Good Damage, Cheap!|
|Archer| Best range, medium health, medium damage, medium cost.|
|Goblin| Great specialty unit (vs resources), very fast, cheap|
|Giant| Great health, Great specialty unit (vs defenses), slow movement, high cost, high housing supply (5), slow to train (2m)|
|Wall Breakers| Low Health, Great specialty unit (vs walls), high cost, slow to train (2m)|
|Balloon|Low Health, Air Unit, Great specialty unit (vs defenses in bases weak in Air Defense), high Damage, medium-slow to train (5m), high housing supply (5), slow movement|
|Wizards| Low Health, High Damage, Low Range, High housing supply (4), high cost, slow to train (10m)|
|Healer| Low health, High Healing of Friendly Units (Splash healing), Flying unit, high cost, slow to train (20m), high supply (20)|
|Dragon| High Health, High Damage, High Cost, High housing supply (20), slow to train (30m), Flying unit, High Cost|
|P.E.K.K.A | High Health, High Damage, High Cost, High housing supply (25), slow to train (60m), High Cost|

**3.2 Balloons - Target: Defenses**  
I’m starting with Balloons because they are the simplest to understand. Because they target defenses and fly (ignoring walls and other obstacles) their path is very easy to predict. All there is to know is that after being placed, they will attack the nearest defensive structure. Once that defense is dead, they will go to the next nearest. Now lets turn that knowledge into practice. This means you can complete ignore walls, resource buildings, army camps, etc etc etc. ONLY look at what the closest defensive structure is (Cannon, Mortar, Archer Tower, Air Defense, Wizard Tower, X-Bow, Tesla) when trying to predict what the Balloon will do.

Balloons also do splash damage, but it isn’t of any tactical value. Sometimes it will destroy walls or damage nearby buildings depending on their placement over their target.

Some bases are very simple to predict because there is always a “next closest” tower that is very easily identifiable. [Here is an example base that is moderately easy to predict](http://imgur.com/rE0jN) where the balloons are going to go. The circles are the spawn points, and the balloons will follow the burgundy path in the indicated direction due to the next closest being where it is. But this gets more complicated in some bases. Here is a method of practice/testing yourself.

Now test yourself:  

Instructions:   

* Open up the [Balloon Practice image](http://imgur.com/jnonk)  
* Pick one of the colored dots.  
* If you placed a Balloon(s) here, in what order would it attack the defenses? (ignoring the fact that it might die)  
* Check yourself against the answer for the color you picked, then try another: [Yellow](http://imgur.com/pn9Tb) and [Blue](http://imgur.com/Ir6xA) and [Orange](http://imgur.com/p2iUq)

Interesting Point #1 - Yellow and Blue
After destroying the Archer Tower next to #1, why would the balloons go after the cannon rather than the Air Defense turret? Both are the same distance from the archer tower, and walls don’t matter. The Balloon would likely go after the cannon first because when it came from the Mortar, it didn’t hover directly over the Archer Tower, it stayed offset to the side of the mortar, making the balloon slightly closer to the cannon. If you had deployed 10 balloons, there would be some variance. I would expect maybe 2 of the 10 balloons would go after the archer tower rather than the Cannon, but the other 8 would probably go after the cannon.

Interesting Point #2 - Yellow  
After destroying the Air Defense turret, would the Balloon(s) go after the Mortar or the Cannon? This is a question of which is closer - it is hard to tell. Just estimating, they both look to be pretty close distance from the Air Defense, I would estimate a pack of Balloons would split up, some going for one and some going for  the other. Lets see what the math says: (you obviously wouldn’t have time to do this when attacking)

Mortar is centered 4 tiles away on the diagonal (4 up, 4 over) using the [Pythagorean Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) we can calculate this as a distance of 5.65 normal tiles in a straight line, as the balloon flies.

Meanwhile, the Cannon is 6 units over, and 1 unit up, or 6.08 units in a direct line.

Therefore, the mortar is actually closer, but it is a close enough difference we would probably get some balloons attacking each from the Air Defense.

Interesting Point #3 - Orange  
Mortar is 4 up, 1 over 4.1 units straight line, Cannon is 4 over, total 4 units. See mathy explanation in interesting point #2.

**3.3 Giants - Target: Defenses  &amp; Goblins - Target: Resources**  
Giants and Goblins are two units that are very good at what they do: taking out Defenses and Resources, respectively. They are more complicated than Balloons because of walls - and walls just make life more complex.

So after reading section 3.2 about Balloons, we should all know that after spawning units go after their nearest favorite target. Once that building is dead, they then go after the NEXT nearest of their favorite target. But what happens if the nearest favorite is behind a wall? Well then the units need to decide which to go after. This is dependant on distance and how hard the closest target is to get to. The units will prefer to go after the close one, even if it has to kill a wall first, if the father target is more than roughly 15-20 steps away. Both Goblins and Giants operate exactly the same, except for their target.

IMPORTANT: Once it decides to attack a wall to get to their target on the other side, it will only stop attacking the wall if another nearby wall is destroyed allowing access to a target, not necessarily their original target. They will NOT stop if their target is destroyed by other units. This means if it is critical to “reset” the target of a giant, you can use a wall breaker to destroy a nearby wall.

In practice, it is harder to predict exactly how a giant will attack a base compared to how a balloon because it has to deal with the walls in the way. In reality, however, you don’t need to predict exactly where the giant is going to go during the entire match, just until it takes out the critical building you’re aiming for (typically mortar if you’re a lower level player).

You should also be thinking about other situations - What would happen if when the pack of giants was HERE, I used wall breakers to blow up the wall THERE? Would they divert? Similarly, what happens if I use archers to pick off this one turret, to the Giants then perform better because they take a different route? [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/VjVjI.jpg) is an example of combining several units and timing their attacks to coordinate. 

[Picture of giant path finding in simple base](http://imgur.com/ChU4K)

Now test yourself:  

Instructions:   
* Open up the [Giant Practice image](http://imgur.com/soQHC)  
* Pick one of the colored dots.  
* If you placed a Giants(s) here, in what order would it attack the defenses? (ignoring the fact that it might die)   
* Check yourself against the answer for the color you picked, then try another: [Purple](http://imgur.com/5wcew) and [Blue](http://imgur.com/CSIWc) and [Red](http://imgur.com/DzoFl)  

I actually attacked this base, [you can see a slideshow of how I chose to attack and the results.](http://imgur.com/a/gfxKE#0)

[Here is a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA) of attacking a different base with giants and having to predict where they are going to go.  Relevent section ony starts [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA#t=260s).

**3.4 Barbarians, Dragons &amp; P.E.K.K.A - Target: Any**  
Barbarians, Dragons and P.E.K.K.As are quite simple. They simply attack the nearest thing. Barbarians and P.E.K.K.As, being ground units have to deal with walls while dragons don’t. Both All of these units are very tanky units, soaking tons of damage, while dealing a very respectable amount themselves. The only ‘tactic’ for using these units is to make sure whatever the nearest target is is the one you want them to go for. This means you might deploy some barbarians to clear out some buildings outside of the enemy walls and  some giants to break open the wall, then you can deploy more barbarians and if the closest target is within the walls, they will happily march through the hole you already created. You can see an enemy attempting this on a small scaler scale against me in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vCsFmjObJY) [Relevant section: 1:08].

**3.5 Archers &amp; Wizards - Target: Any**  
Archers and Wizards, being the two ranged units in the game, are able to partially ignore those pesky walls that all of the ground units have to deal with. As both Archers and Wizards have ‘Any’ as their favorite target, what they target is fairly simple - the closest target that they can reach.

However, in the situation that there is something nearby that is just out of range, they will ignore it and go for the next closest, reachable, target. Archers can’t shoot over a wall followed by two empty spaces, followed by the building in question.


**3.6 Healers - Target: Any**  
Healer AI goes for the nearest (usually) hurt ally and heals them until they are fully healed or dead, then finds a new target. Once locked on they will continue to follow their target, ignoring all threats to their life. They can only heal ground units, so don’t try to use them on Balloons, Dragons, or other healers. The most important feature about healers is their ability to cast in an Area of Effect - so they heal all units within a fairly significant radius of their target. They do not automatically heal clusters, of hurt units, unfortunately, so hopefully the single guy the healer locked onto is staying with the clump. The Area of Effect is twice that of a wizard tower and half that of a mortar (although mortar has damage drop off farther from center).

As they are flying units, the Healer’s arch nemesis is the dreaded Air Defense turret.

[Example video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA) of Healer switching targets when full. Attack starts [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA#t=260s) and healer section starts [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=WdanGH9e8jA#t=307s) if you want to skip to the specific part. Same video from Giant section, if you already watched it, watch it from the healer link if you need a reminder.

Another example could be to choose whether your archers have a bow or a crossbow, and then built on from that how each looks again unlocking more with each level.

They lowered the prices of the dark barracks, they can make this change too...

Current Prices vs. What I think they should be:

**CURRENTLY:**

Lvl. 1: 200 gold

Lvl. 2: 1,000 gold

Lvl. 3: 5,000 gold

Lvl. 4: 10,000 gold

Lvl. 5: 30,000 gold

Lvl. 6: 75,000 gold

Lvl. 7: 200,000 gold (wtf...)

Lvl. 8: 500,000 gold (this is getting pricey)

Lvl. 9: 1,000,000 gold

Lvl. 10: 3,000,000 gold

Lvl. 11: 4,000,000 gold

vs.

**WHAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE AND WHY** (some are the same):

Lvl. 1: 500 gold (200 is too cheap)

Lvl. 2: 1,000 gold

Lvl. 3: 5,000 gold

Lvl. 4: 10,000 gold

Lvl. 5: 30,000 gold

Lvl. 6: 60,000 gold

Lvl. 7: 125,000 gold

Lvl. 8: 250,000 gold

Lvl. 9: 500,000 gold

Lvl. 10: 1,000,000 gold (makes sense for lvl 10 to be 1,000,000)

Lvl. 11: 2,500,000 gold (almost cut the price in half but its STILL expensive!)

I think they should be lowered because of the overall total cost of walls per TH. For example, with the old prices at TH8, it costs a total of **45,000,000** gold JUST to get all 225 walls from lvl. 6 walls to lvl. 7. With the improved prices it will cost **28,125,000** from lvl.6-7. THAT'S STILL A TON! and to go from lvl.7-8 walls it costs **112,500,000**. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that is a 250% price increase *FOR* *ONE* *LEVEL!* WTF!? with the improved prices, lvl7-8 walls would cost a total of **56,250,000** gold for 225 walls.  Now, it's obvious why the prices are TOO DAMN HIGH, greed! So Supercell, think about it.

**EDIT**: If the walls are too strong for the low price, just lower the hp, each wall is like a damn town hall anyway.

**EDIT#2**: Some may not have noticed, but this improved system follows a nice, even elevation in price. It is cheaper, but not cheap enough to cause everyone to upgrade their walls. The adjusted prices are still large enough, so you can feel ""proud"" of your walls. And for the people that have already upgraded their walls, that's too bad. This idea is balanced and follows a pattern that makes sense, rather than a 250% price raise.",,False,self,t5_2usfk,1375933900.0,,,True,t3_1jwnzp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1jwnzp/walls_need_to_be_like_this/,

* Remember to follow [**reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). [HIMB] posts have been getting a lot of flak. In these posts OP is asking for advice. Badly designed bases should **not** be downvoted. Comment the reasons why you dislike the design, and offer help instead. 

&gt;Do not downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

* Check out the [**Updated Clan Directory**](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/wiki/official_reddit_clan_system)! 

* New mods!  [We are still looking for more!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1I0k4rBSMDnC4zp4pZ18_tmxX46tP8Y5cO1R0CH1-ZGw/edit) Currently we're looking for moderators with CSS experience.

Each time you log back in, it asks you for your password (and also possibly attempts to make a purchase).  

Neither Apple or Supercell have a fix, and from the looks of their forums, it has affected thousands, if not millions of users globally. 

Safest bet is to wait until official news from either company.  Clash on!

But I have to wait until someone attacks it in order to see its weaknesses.  This is why I came up with the idea of self attacks.

On the attack screen above the campaign map there would be a location labelled as your base.  When you clicked on it, your base would show up with the amount of resources that could theoretically be stolen and a 3 minute timer just as any normal attack.  You could then coordinate an attack on your base and discover its strengths and weaknesses.

In order to keep this fair, you could neither gain nor lose resources from your attack.  Also, you'd still have to spend elixir and train an army as normal and would lose any troops that you drop just as you would in any other attack.  Finally, if you had a shield, it would be lost once you drop troops on your base.

My ideas about the statistics were:

* Average loot per raid


* Average number of trophies gained/lost per raid


* How many of each level you have of a building, i.e. 39 level 6 walls, and 136 level 7 walls


* Average amount of gold/elixir stored at a time


* How many you've donated of each troop


* How many and what troops a certain defense killed (courtesy of [Macasnack](http://www.reddit.com/user/Macasnack))

It's simple things like these that would make the game interesting, and none of this would be hard to do, since most of the list is already stored somewhere.

You just slap one down, and immediately the option to put another adjacent wall is right in front of you. Changing directions is easy too.

It would be great if there were a way to collect all of the already built walls and place them in a ""wall bank"" that we could then access when laying down our walls again.

*ie*:
 
* say we have a base layout that we want to completely rearrange. We then select a wall and press a ""collect all"" button, which then follows up with a ""Are you sure you would like to collect all of your walls?"" Upon saying yes, all your walls disappear from the base.
* then after rearranging our buildings, we go to resources and select ""walls"". instead of laying down a shitty wooden wall first, it gives us the option to lay down our highest-level wall. we lay it down as we would a new wall. it then just keeps taking from our bank until all of our purchased walls have been laid down, then lays down the wooden ones as if we were buying them.

some of the most time-consuming and frustrating times in the game are when you have to move one-by-one each wall. Row-selecting is nice but sometimes doesn't do the trick.

Some history:

* Past: 20 gems for 6 hours of x2 production

6 hours boosting grants you 6*3000=18,000 bonus

Thats approx **900** resources per gem.

* Currently: 11 gems for 24 hours of x2 production

1 day boosting grants you 24*3000=72,000

Thats approx **6545** resources per gem.

While this might seem little to most of you, compared to gemming it purely: Assuming you buy exactly 8,001,000 resources (best value) it would cost 2467 gems.

Thats a mere **3243** resources per gem. Thats exactly 2 times more of a bang for your buck.

Sadly, to earn that 8 million gold would take 19/16 days depending on if you have 6/7 maxed collectors. But its definitely more worth it now.

**TLDR:** Boosting is awesome now! if you have spare gems after purchasing 5 workers, definitely consider using it.

EDIT: Requested by Linushz

Currently...DE with gems its **35** de per gem. (200k for 5667 gems)

With the new boost: (ill only do lvl3 and lvl6 for th8/9 respectively)

-lvl 3: 15 gems for 1 day: **72** de per gem! 

-lvl 6: 34 gems for one day, its about **70** de per gem! which compared to straight up buying, its twice as good! Funny though how the effectiveness reduces.

Sadly...in this case...it would take 28 days with 3 maxed de drills to get 200k...but its definitely much cheaper! (2856 gems vs 5667 gems)

I donated Archers to Shroomprint as it was indicated in his Troop request (he didn't change it). I didn't catch it in the chat that he was talking to someone and he going to pass a Dragon to him. I apologized immediately (as seen on Image 1) after I realized my mistake but this Elder immediately threatened to kick me for a simple mistake that I apologized for quickly. I am an active donator in the Clan with 750+ troops donated last season. Which was way over the requirement when Phi's minimum per season was 250.

Second image shows TLeslie requesting for troops and he indicated what he wanted, so I suggested that that is how you should do it. His rudeness continues until the next chat and he all of a sudden kicks me. Also note that in Image 4, he says 'we' decided to kick you. Who's we? No other Elders were online, just him.

I'm just disappointed that I got kicked out for something as trivial as this when I am an active team member. Also, this person is forgetting that he is representing the image of Reddit.

1363127674.0,38,self.ClashOfClans,1a6dln,Keep track of your upgrades - a simple tool for your service,azazel_kon,42,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1a6dln/keep_track_of_your_upgrades_a_simple_tool_for/,"Dear CoC Community,

As most of you know it's a good practice to max out your buildings before moving to the next level of your Town Hall.
But the higher level you become, the more difficult it becomes to keep in mind all the things you should upgrade.

And after some time of playing tricky games with my memory I decided to somehow automate/simplify this process.
As a result I got a handy Excel document which serves me in some ways:

* keeps track of upgrades left on current Town Hall level;

* provides information about how much time and resources is required to finish all the upgrades;

* serves as mini-wiki providing information about cost and duration of upgrades.


I want to share this tool with all you and hope it will help at least some of you.
[Here it is](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nk24tay292sxloq/CoC.xlsx)


How-to use it:

* set your current Town Hall level (you will find instructions inside how to do it);

* optionally set number of builders;

* set levels of your buildings/troops in appropriate cells (for example, if you have two cannons of level 3 and 4, you will put 4 in cell C16 - Cannon #1 - and 3 in C17 - Cannon #2);

* set number of walls of each level you currently have (for example, if you have 100 golden and 50 black walls, you will put 100 in H83 cell - level 5 walls - and 50 in H82 cell - level 4 walls. If total number of walls exceeds currently available number of walls for you Town Hall level, then you will see some cells marked with red background);

* enjoy.

How-to read information:

* green cells - you do not need to upgrade this building/troop on your current Town Hall level (either because it is maxed or not available yet)

* yellow cells - you still have some upgrades to do on your current Town Hall level;

* pinkish cells - this upgrade is not yet available for you.


**NOTE:** For the sake of consistency I introduced level 1 upgrades for troops and set their cost ant time to 0. Just ignore it, it's always green.


**DISCLAIMER:** There is no information about Dark Elixir yet. I will probably add it later. Don't ask me when.


**CREDITS:**

Thanks to Supercell for creating this game.

Thanks to http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki for information about costs/times.

Thanks to Flammy for his wonderful gameplay videos.

Thanks to all of the members of CoC Community just because it exists.


**TRIVIA:**

To fully build and upgrade your base from TH1 to maxed TH9 you will need:

Gold (without mines/collectors and walls): 275,755,950

Gold (with mines/collectors and walls): 277,931,250

Gold for walls: 1,084,770,000

Elixir (without mines/collectors): 102,615,000

Elixir (with mines/collectors): 104,790,300

Laboratory upgrades: 84,000,000

Build time (without mines/collectors): 983.13 days

Build time (with mines/collectors): 1171.8 days

Laboratory upgrades time: 208.25 d

This numbers might not be absolutely accurate but still they how many efforts this game requires.


**YET ANOTHER DISCLAIMER:**

I'm pretty sure some of you may want to see some improvements/features for this tool.
You can post them in the comments but I'm not very sure I will be able to implement them due to the limited amount of free time.
But maybe I'll try. Who knows? :)
And of course I take no responsibility for any harm/damage done to you or your computer by using this file. :)

Good clashing to all of you!


**UPDATE**

Updated file with dark elixir troops and heroes. Due to lack of information about durations of dark elixir troops upgrades I temporarily put zeroes there. As soon as this information becomes available I'll update the document.

If somebody told the formula of conversion resources/time into gems I would use it to find out how much gems does everything cost :) Don't you think that might be interesting?

This info was posted over on the official forums and it is third hand at this point, but everything is in line with what we know...

* Dark elixir is unlocked at TH7, will be used to upgrade Hero units

* Dark Hero units return to base after an attack (presumably if they die they come back with 0 hp), they slowly regain HP (over some number of hours) and are upgradable to level 30

* Dark elixir has its own storage, will be built with elixir. Dark elixir can be stolen

* New level 9 *and* 10 walls. Cost: 1m and 3m each

* New level 2 and level 3 crossbow. Level 3 crossbow may cost 8 million, causing another gold storage to be added 

* No new TH level in this update

* More sneak peaks over the next few days

* The update will either be out this Thursday-or-so OR be out next Tuesday-ish. Either way, soon! (Devs didn't say an actual release date, and the date they said may have been when they were done coding and bug testing which means it then need to be submitted to apple which is a ~6 day process) 

* If more people have reported in any other info, please include below in the comments

1370641622.0,35,self.ClashOfClans,1fw29l,New Troop/Hero Idea: Mercenaries (IN DEPTH),CaptainObvious1906,44,9,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1fw29l/new_troophero_idea_mercenaries_in_depth/,"The mercenary would function much like actual mercenaries do -- they're hired to fight with your current army for a certain time. They would be similar to Heroes in that they are bigger and separate from other troops, but they would come with their own special powers outside of the normal game. In addition, they wouldn't need to be built, just simply purchased (and be expensive to purchase, to prevent abuse) when need be. They cannot be upgraded. Here are some mercenaries I came up with, but other suggestions are welcome.

**Lucky Davinian**

Sort of an Irish-themed mercenary, he could wear a bit of green and have flaming red hair, I suppose.

* Unlocked at TH6
* Costs 500,000 gold to hire (available for 3 battles)
* Does 120 dps, movement speed 20, 1000 HP
* Attacks with brass knuckles, so short range (1 square)
* Regeneration time: 30 mins
**Lucky Strike:** Every hit, Lucky has the 20% chance of doing 480 dps instead of the usual 120
* Has an awesome catch phrase he says randomly: ""Blarney,"" ""Well ain't that a pot o' gold,"" or something to that effect. 

**Sir Lance Prowder**

The knight-for-hire, he has a large brown stallion and has a full suit of armor on that clanks when he walks.

* Unlocked at TH7
* Costs 750,000 gold to hire (available for 3 battles)
* Does 90 dps, movement speed 40 (he is on a horse, after all), has 1300 HP
* Attacks quickly with lance, medium range (3 squares max)
* Regeneration time: 40 mins
**Spear of Destiny:** up to twice per battle, Lance will throw a spear straight through whatever is directly in his path, doing decreasing damage to all the buildings in the way. The spear goes all the way across the map, doing damage to troops and buildings but only in a straight line. 300 damage for first building, 250 for the next, then 200, 150, and so on. The minimum it can do is 50 dmg.
His metal armor would also get him 1.5 damage from teslas
* Catch phrases: ""For king and country!"" ""For honor and glory!"" or other noble stuff 

**Sludge McGruber**

The goblins' discarded secret weapon, this ogre would be mean, green and ugly, growling as he goes.

* Unlocked at TH8
* Costs 1,000,000 gold to hire (available for 2 battles)
* Does 140 dps, movement speed 14, 1500 HP
* Regeneration time 50 mins
* Attacks with sludge he vomits up from short range (2 squares max), splash damage, focused on weapons first
**Toxic Sludge:** once per battle (30 seconds in battle must pass before ability is activated), Sludge will start to vomit dark blue poisonous sludge but attack buildings only once before moving on. It does 150 damage initially, but does 8 dmg/second afterwards for the remainder of the battle
* Catch phrase: ""Arrghhhhoooooo"" or equally ravenous growl 

**Isis Raven**

The most feared assassin that ever lived, she would wear a dark blue ninja-style half mask and have long black hair.

* Unlocked at TH9
* Costs 1.5 million gold to hire (available for 2 battles)
* Does 140 dps/100 dps, movement speed 26, 750 HP
* Regeneration time: 1 hour
* Attacks with assassin's dagger for close targets (140 dps, 1 square), ninja stars for further targets (100 dps, 4 squares max)
**Nightshade:** Isis has a 40% chance of dodging every attack
**Shadow Run:** Once per battle (40 seconds required before activation), Isis will begin to teleport anywhere around the city being attacked (once every 2-3 seconds) and unleash a supercharged stab with her dagger (300 damage). Lasts for 30 seconds.
* Mortars push back/stun Isis more than usual because of her light frame and small stature (unless dodged)
* Catch phrase: ""I am the night,"" ""It's over,"" or just a really taunting assassin's laugh. 

**Commander Yao** (yes, like Jorge, and yes, I'm poking fun at Kim Jong-un)

An Asian-themed general determined to win at all costs, he would wear circle-framed glasses and a grey uniform with lots of medals.

* Unlocked at TH10
* Costs 1.5 million gold to hire (available for 1 battle)
* Does 200 dps, 18 movement speed, 1500 HP
* Regeneration time: 2 hours
* Attacks with general's baton (1 square), focused on weapons first
**Soldier's Duty:** Any troop within range will jump in front of the Commander and take the hit for him except for splash damage.
**Morale Boost:** Commander Yao has a 5% chance of yelling ""fight harder!"" which boosts all troops on the map's damage by 100% for 15 seconds. They should glow red as a result.
**General's Salute:** Commander Yao has a 10% chance of sending up his own mortar-style bomb (the cannon should just appear beside him) that does 350 splash damage.
**Imperial Force:** (1 minute required before activation, once per battle) Cmdr. Yao enters into a large robot (think Gundam) and starts a rampage. Laser cannons do 300 dps and have 8 spaces of range, dirty bombs do 50 splash damage each, and it resets his HP counter to 1500 no matter what it was at before. The robot will also fly and change position every 15 seconds (this is when dirty bombs are activated, lasers don't work in the air).
* All weapons are automatically focused on Cmdr. Yao if he is in range.
* Catch phrase: ""To victory!"" ""No retreat!"" and other armyisms. ",,False,self,t5_2usfk,1370642009.0,,,True,t3_1fw29l,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1fw29l/new_troophero_idea_mercenaries_in_depth/,

About three or so weeks ago, clan leadership changed from S1GMA, who had been the long-time leader to /u/Edgearith (game name Edgearoth), who had only been a member for a couple of weeks. S1GMA had found that he no longer had the time to manage a clan, so he stepped down and left. Edgearoth then instituted a bunch of unpopular policies:

* He rejected the former leader when he reapplied to join the clan.
* He refused to appoint more than 2 elders (one of whom is practically inactive), which caused requests to join the clan to go unheeded for hours — my friend had to wait 4 hours, until her request was almost out of the chat log, before I could get someone to accept her.
* When the Share Replay function came out, he banned anybody from using it. Eventually, I guess he changed his mind or something, because nobody listened to him and shared replays anyway.
* Today, he told people to stop asking for dragons and to stop donating dragons, because apparently some people were having trouble reaching their donation requirements with dragons filling up clan castles.

I was an active member. I donated ~3,000 troops last season, and 1,200 so far this season. I spoke out about all of these issues, and each time, despite having majority support in the clan chat, I was threatened to be kicked. I was never impolite, and I did not ever insult the man (or any other member). All I did was talk about the issues. Well, I guess the dragon issue was the straw that broke the camel's back. When I brought it up, he simply said ""I'm not going to discuss it with you"", and when I urged him to have a conversation about it, I was kicked.

I had a feeling he was going to do something unreasonable, so I took a [couple of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/7Gq0u). But I was kicked before I could take the ones that really mattered. If anyone is still in that clan, maybe they can take them from the chat log to corroborate what I've said.

*To my friends in Sigma*: it's been a fun time. I enjoyed talking with all of you, critiquing bases and raids, and donating for your requests. I'm sorry that your leader has an insufficient maturity level to have a reasonable discussion with another member without resorting to the kick button.

*To Edgearoth*: Who elected you, /u/Edgeiroth? Why can't we talk about policies before you unilaterally institute them on a whim? And before you accuse me of some esoteric offense unrelated to the issue at hand, have the decency to provide *some* semblance of proof for your accusations.

**UPDATE**: It looks like Edgearoth has kicked everyone out of the clan and taken it upon himself to shut the whole thing down (2/50 members at the moment), separating a great, fun-loving group of people from each other. Please keep that in mind if you consider inviting him to your own clan in the future.",,False,self,t5_2usfk,1376177941.0,,Shield9,True,t3_1k43t9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1k43t9/reddit_sigma_has_issues/,

TL;DR I fucked up the donations competition. This isn't a I'm sorry post, because I don't deserve forgiveness, I promised something and didn't follow through. But I still have 9 iTunes gift cards, what do I do with them?

* Level 5 minion health dropped two points
* New wizard tower added 
* New air defense tower added

This is frustrating to those that dedicated the time and even real life money to acquire level 5 minions.   We did this with a strategy in mind that is quickly flying out the window! 

Also aggravating is that laboratory research time for minions has been cut by at least by several days at multiple levels.  This takes any desire to invest in Clash of Clans in the future, as it's anyone's guess what they are going to change. 

I understand that the dragon invasions had to be balanced, and it's good they addressed that.  However, they are not showing minion users any love!  Is it not enough that 10-15 minions can be erased by just *one* of four air bombs.

Is anyone else frustrated about this?  What do people think about air bombs **not** one-hit killing level 5 minions?

----------  

Welcome to Chapter 0! This isn't an introduction to the rest of my guide, it is just simply what newbs should know when they get started, prior to their first multiplayer match. Why Chapter 0? Because I didn't think to write this first. 

What will this chapter do? Give you a great start in the game. 

What will it NOT do? Explain why you're doing all of these things. Some are rather important (if I say it more than once, I consider it important). Also this guide doesn't teach you how to lay out your base. Check chapter 1 for that. 

Where can you find out *why* you're doing these things? Well check out my other chapters for the why. 

Want advice but don't feel like reading? I've recorded a bunch of youtube videos. [Start Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rap0r5lEGyU&amp;list=PLmcCn9jl33OXCQVJvKmGX8tYmVTWgErvW&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video)

^^ Those videos are a lot less structured than these written guides (I jump around topics a lot, as to what applies to us at the moment), but cover a lot of the same material.

**0.1 First 48 hours**  
Welcome! You've just started. What now?  
Well if you haven't completed the tutorial, you should do that first. (The tutorial has lots of big arrows pointing at different things they want you to click on.) If you *haven't* completed the tutorial, you should know you don't *have* to spend gems on speeding up the constructions or getting resource to start the next construction, instead you can wait for the constructions to finish on their own or wait for your base to accumulate enough resources. Choice is yours. Likewise, you don't have to deploy all of the wizards. Two will do just fine if you place them next to the cannon. 

OK now what?  
Well for the first 48 hours, upgrade resource collection (gold mines, elixir collectors) and resource storage (elixir storage, gold storage). Be sure you've built all of the gold mines and elixir mines that you can. When you can, upgrade your town hall.  
NOTE: Upgrade your elixir collectors and gold mines from the lowest level to the highest.  
NOTE: Do NOT yet build defenses, walls, traps, etc. yet.  
They are not needed yet. You have a 3 day shield (more on that later) but it basically means you can't get attacked until it runs out. How much time you have left is indicated by the shield counter on the top-middle-right side of your screen. You *can* deactivate your shield early by searching for a multiplayer match under the attack menu. I don't recommend doing so.  Note: do NOT build a second gold storage or a second elixir storage. Wait about a week in game to do that (you'll know when) 

**0.2 48-72 hours**  
OK you've got about 24 hours left on your shield. Now what?  
Start building and upgrading defenses! 

Priority from highest to lowest: 
Mortar 
Archer Tower(s)
Cannon(s) 

This means build and upgrade your archer towers to level 2 before you upgrade your cannons to level 2. 

You can also defend your base with walls. For how to design your defenses, see [Chapter 1: Base Defense Basics](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/114eur/clash_of_clans_strategy_guide_chapter_1_base/) 

**0.3 Really, Really, Quick DOs and DON'Ts**  
DO:  
Upgrade your elixir collectors and gold mines to a high level (level 5 for all of them is a good goal by the end of the 48 hours if you're an active player)  
Upgrade your elixir and gold storage as needed  
Attack the goblins in single player (good income for the first day or two)  

DO NOT:  
Build a second gold storage OR a second elixir storage  
Bother building defenses before the last ~24 hours of your shield  
Attack other players in multiplayer (it gets rid of your shield)  
Spend Gems  (more on this later) 

**0.4 Frequently Asked Questions**  

If you have a question that is not on this list, feel free to [PM me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Flammy) or reply to this post. 

**0.4.1 What happens when I'm attacked?**  
If you are attacked you can lose your resources and a few trophies (more on trophies later, they are unimportant for now). That is it. Period. Any buildings, defenses or walls that are damaged or destroyed pop right back up with no penalty. Traps that are triggered need to be re-purchased (one time use). 

This means there is NO penalty at all if Army Camps, Barracks, Builder's Huts, Walls, or Defenses are destroyed. 

If Gold Mines, Elixir Collectors, gold storage, or elixir storage is damaged or destroyed, *some* of their resources will be stolen by the enemy. Protect these buildings. 

**0.4.2 Trophies?**   
Trophies are how the game measures skill. Beating an opponent earns you trophies. If someone attacks you and fails, they lose trophies. 

More trophies are earned if the enemy has more trophies than you. More are lost if you lose to someone with less trophies than you. 

**0.4.3 Gems?**
Gems are the premium currency in the game. You can use them to buy extra builder's huts, buy a shield (1 day, 2 day, 7 day), buy resources, boost gold mines and elixir collectors, instantly train troops, boost training rate for troops, or spend them on decorations (pointless). 

Of all of the above, only builder's huts add a permanent benefit to your base. All of the other boosts or instant-completes run out after a few hours. Typically, players attempt to save gems to earn a 3rd (and eventually, possibly, 4th builder's huts) 

**0.4.4 Resources? (Gold, Elixir)**  
Gold and Elixir are the two resources in the game. 

Gold is used for buying, building, and upgrading elixir collectors, elixir storage, defenses, walls, traps, the town hall, the clan castle. It is generally considered more valuable by players as you can instantly spend it on your walls in basically unlimited amounts (Maxing your walls costs a grand total of 164,240,000 or 164 MILLION gold). Gold can also be used to buy spells once the spell factory is complete. 

Elixir is used for buying, building, and upgrading gold mines, gold storage, army camps, barracks, laboratory and spell factory. It is also used for training units and researching upgrades in the laboratory. 

**0.4.5 Shield?**  
Shields prevent you from being attacked. You get a shield for free every time you are damaged to a significant degree (12 hour for being 40% damaged, 16 hour for being 90% damaged) 

You can also buy 1 day, 2 day, and 7 day shields with gems. 

**0.4.6 How do I control my units?**  
You can't. You don't control your units at all once they are placed. Place them near the target you want them to go for. 

Each unit also has a 'favorite target' they will ONLY attack until all of those targets are dead, then they will attack anything. (see the 'i' info button in the barracks for each unit's favorite target as well as extra info) 

Units will generally attack the nearest target of their choice. Ranged units and walls slightly complicate this. 

A much more detailed explanation of unit AI and pathfinding as well as unit strengths can be found in [Chapter 3: Unit Strengths, AI, and Pathfinding](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/12o3tx/clash_of_clans_strategy_guide_chapter_3_unit/

**0.4.7 Why don't I get my units back after a battle?**  
To keep the game balanced. 

Imagine if you got back your super amazing, awesomely deadly, crazily expensive army if it survived the battle. You would be able to attack and attack and attack... all day. And that means someone else could do it to you, too. 

It also means you should only place as many units as you need to defeat the current base as to not waste any units. 
 
**0.4.8 OK, I screwed up. Can I reset?**  

Yes, but it is not easy. 

I also don't recommend restarting, even if you broke every one of the things listed above. 

To reset do this: 

* Plug your iDevice into your computer and back up via iTunes

* Factory reset your iDevice with iTunes 

* Restore via backup (5-15 min process) 

* Create a new Game Center ID if you had been using one before while playing Clash of Clans and log into it. If you don't have a Game Center account, skip this step. 

* Redownload and launch Clash of Clans 

You can also play your village on several devices at the same time. Simply log in with your same Game Center Account on the new device and launch Clash Of Clans. 

**0.4.9 Why do I keep getting attacked by one unit?**  

These are people intentionally lowering their trophy count. As a side effect, you gain a lot of trophies from them. As the number of trophies determines who you find in matchmaking, this means you will find harder opponents and they will find easier ones. More details can be found in ADD

1. See who donated which troops. Just by clicking each troop in a clan castle, the donators name could pop up or something like that.


2. Ability to see if the player is online, offline, or attacking. Maybe there could be a little green dot or something next to a players name to show that he/she is online, and maybe a sword or something like that to show if he/she is attacking. This would be helpful to see if players aren't donating or responding because they don't want to, or if they are offline.


3. Leader messages fix. I am the leader of my clan (The Dan Clan- Im Dirty Dan feel free to join!) and I often wish that I could send messages to individual players or just elders or something like that but the only option is to send a message to everybody. I would just really like to be able to send messages to specific players.


4. Base saving and Self attacking. I switch between different farming bases and trophy hunting bases. It would just be really helpful to be able to save my base, and then if I make another one and want to go back to my original base, be able to instantly switch my layout back to the original base (The one that I saved) This would just help a lot with saving time or experimenting to see which base is best.
The self attacking is the ability to attack yourself for free, to see how your base holds up against different attacks. The only reason this wouldn't be a good idea is that people could design their base like someone who previously attacked them, and practice on it so that they know how to beat it.


Sorry if some of that didn't make sense Im not very good at explaining and sorry that it is so long! Please leave some comments on what you think about these features.

1373180904.0,35,self.ClashOfClans,1hsjp4,Childish Trophy/Hybrid Update for TH9 is here! TH8/ TH9 -3 Versions. links inside,CHiLDiSH402,38,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1hsjp4/childish_trophyhybrid_update_for_th9_is_here_th8/,"Hello my fellow redditors! I apologize for not being as active as i used to be on the threads but since april i have taken on the role of clan leader have been busy trophy pushs and webpage updates.
That being said, even though i'm active on other forums i never forget where i came from. My hats off to Flammy for all the time and effort he puts into the game for all of us.  Flammy was the one out of the 3 
pioneers of youtubers that helped me achieve the level in base designing that i am  at today!! I felt it was my duty to pay it forward and continue to share some of my designs i have created over the past few months. I hope you enjoy!!

Disclaimer: All of my bases are  setup to protect 1 main resource + DE. So yes a few storages
will be exposed.

TH8 Version: CC and DE were swap as at the time i had alot of DE - CC is normally centralized. 
This is design for TH8 players that use only 4 storages + DE
http://i.imgur.com/23HoOwz.jpg

Old Hybrid Version:


http://i.imgur.com/UaGtOYw.jpg
Pros:

-Balanced Point defenses

-Centralized CC! (a pain to do for most hybrids without offsetting everything else)

-Centralized Xbows ( perfect coverage using ground setting)

-Storage prioritization ( 1 regular resource + DE. DE ‘s placeholder is the north gold storage)

-Overlapping Wizard towers @ North side for additional DE protection when it gets high
.
- Adjusted T junctions / Staggered X-junctions to prevent WBers from opening multiple
segments 

Cons:

Offset Splash: Original positions for mortars in TH8 were the 2 northern elixirs but due to having 4 wiz towers vs 3
I relocated them so I didn’t have splash buildings stacked in a position that would also the enemy to take out 2 with 1 set of lightning strikes. With the mortars being just out of range of the most northern segment ( 2 AT/cannon ). Overlapping WTs have been providing good coverage for the DE and surrounding buildings for the time being. 

Exposed ADs on NW/NE side: Initially was intentional and used 2 spring traps behind walls vs a giant healer
rush but I never get attacked with that setup so split up the spring traps between both segments on the top. Spring traps can be setup away from the T-junction as my adjusted walls force the WB to attack that area or around exterior teslas as I have currently.

Update: Hybrid for Trophy Pushing Version A

http://i.imgur.com/ymFSulE.jpg

Swap Elixir for exposed Air Defenses for better protection

Xbows switch to Air for better protection

Additional segmentation on Southside since TH is offset to the south.

Added additional traps within chevron as most attackers are trying to come in from the south. (Remember the chevron is a live target   for WB that are deployed from direct south due to 2 AT and Mortars being perfectly aligned)

Cons: Offset/Unbalanced mortars

Thoughts on this version:

I realized early on that the protection of my storages were not as impt as no one cares for resources in the 2000s so I quickly switched the  AD as Air attacks were the norm and winning every fight. After the switch I did not lose one air fight and lost maybe 3/7 ground fights  depending on how many rage spells they used. ( Most that used more than 3 won, lol)


Update: Hybrid Version A to Version B

http://i.imgur.com/oGWBOk9.jpg

Swapped north Air def with wiz tower overlapping coverage on side storages.

Adjusted mortars for better overall  balanced coverage.

Cons: 
Wiz/Mortar susceptible to Lightning strikes making one side week and perfect for attack.

Condensed Air defenses are missing a tad bit of coverage  on far East/West AT and cannon

Thoughts on this version:

So far i'm 3/5 on Defenses from this version but IMO 2 of the attackers didn't know what they were doing so waiting for more defenses to judge.


Overall: Throughout the trophy push the bases held up just under half of their attacks with 3 wiz towrs down and one AD down. When the buildings were up my base held up for about 2/3 of the defensive attacks, however, most were mass dragon or pekka. No GoWiPe or GoWiGi.  I never get attack on the NW/NE despite the T junction; I'm assuming my super cool decos that are in the way of the junctions help ;p

Your thoughts on both versions?
Likes and Dislikes?

Stay tuned for the farming version of this hybrid !!

Sorry if this is redundant but I did a subreddit search and didnt find much on this topic so I have been arranging walls for the last 2 weeks to see how troops will behave and whether or not they will go through walls or go around them.  I built the base like this with wall flanges coming out to see if troops will go through the next layer of walls or go around them.  

What I have noticed so far from this exploratory AI base is about where the size of the wall flanges are now.  7-8 wall segments out and the troops will go around the walls to the next pocket of buildings, but with 9 wall segments they will break through to the next layer of walls.  From this I have lightly determined that the AI is something around 14-17 tile spaces between buildings that they are attacking.  I am ignoring isntances where wall breakers opened up the first layer of walls.  I would say this is accurate about 50% of the time while the other times I am having a hard time explaining the troop behavior.  Any thoughts on how this works?  Thanks

(edit:  Im not asking about my base,  I know its a stupid set up,  I am trying to learn how the troops behave so Im enticing people to attack me so I can look at the replays.)",,False,self,t5_2usfk,1376337614.0,,,True,t3_1k852s,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1k852s/my_artificial_inteligence_exploration_ive/,

6 Level 1 Dragons
10 Level 3 Wizards
8 Level 4 Giants
20 Clan Castle Archers
Level 1 Barbarian King
3 Level 4 Light Spells

So all in all, this was a hour and a half army. Here is how to use it.

Triple light spell the Air Defenses in the middle. It won't kill them. I was kinda hoping because light spells do 390 and Air Defense level 7 is like 1100 but no. So then deploy Burger King, CC Archers, Giants and Wizards as fast as you can. If you get lucky the wizards will do the finishing blows to the Air Defenses as well. Then I dropped 3 drags on each side by the upper archer tower. 
The best part was in the end it was a level 1 drag vs a level 6 tesla, and the dragon's health bar was barely visible. 

Anyway, I thought this was so awesome it deserved a post.

My name is LosPharmD and I am the leader of Reddit Indy, a humble member of the Clash of Clans Subreddit Clan Network. This is a biweekly recap of the goings on in our clan, feel free to check out whats going on and drop us a comment on how you think we did! Always love the feedback! We have **no open spots this week** so please feel free to apply in game if you see a spot open up and think you can keep up with the activity requirements. Don't forget the password!


----------

**Clan Leader Corner:**

Paradigm Shift n. def: *a radical change in underlying beliefs or theory*

Reddit Indy will be embarking in a paradigm shift of epic proportions.... Without any further ado.... I give you... 

**UPDATED CLAN RULES:**

* Troop Donation requirement increased to 200 per week and 400 per season!
* Ratio requirement of 1:3 is in effect (Troops Donated:Received)!
* Members donating above 1000 per season will be exempt from ratio requirement!
* NEW Members must be a minimum of TH 8 and have level 5 archers to join. 

So after discussions with our elders, the Indy leadership council brings you new clan rules. Our goal with this new set of rules is to promote and reward high level donators while discouraging and removing moochers and inactive members. We'll see how these updated rules affect donation numbers as members are now asked to be more mindful of their ratios. 

And now on with the epic stats!

----------


**Donations:**

This season the average clan member donated **1171** troops. That is up from 1153 last season. Our median donation count was **713**. The overall donations went up to **58577** from 57651. Average troops received was **1174** and the Median Ratio (D/R) was **1.21**. We had 18 members with over 1k donations this week. Just amazing!

Top 10 Donators for this week:

* Essex (5208) - New member making it look easy. Nice first impression.
* KENRRM (4254) - Almost a 1k increase in donations compared to last season, I'd say the sleeping giant is awake. 
* lilmissfoodie (4157) - This guy.... oh how I love him!
* Robin $ (3506) - Yes Robin, we like your donations this season ;)
* george (3448) - George remains in the 5th slot for 3 weeks in a row. Makes writing my review easy! Thanks!
* Captain (1999) - Party like its 1999... if you know that song... well then you probably are an old fart like me. Haha
* killerd (1988) - Just sub 2k. Awesome week!
* lomiecakes (1964) - Only been in the clan for half a season and killin' it on donations. 
* Umadbro? (1945) -  Naw... I'm not mad at yea. Not with numbers like this. 
* Awesome-O (1936) - Changing his name to Awesome-Do(nator)



**Donation Top 3 All-time High Scores:**

**1st - c0copopps (12300) - 06/09/13**

**2nd - michel (11111) - 06/09/13**

**3rd - KENRRM (10111) - 05/12/13**

----------

Top 5 Ratios (D/R) for this week:

* Cretodecristo (23.1) - 462:20
* Rexy (15.8) - 630:40
* Diego (6.0) - 621:103 
* Chris_Is_Bored (3.4) - 1436:417
* gubbie1353 (3.3) - 732:220

----------


**Trophy Counts (Current Clan Rank 13990):**

Our Clans Overall Trophy Count this week is **15697** and our average Trophy count for our members was **1443**. The median trophy count this week was **1414** and the average change was **71** trophies. 

Top 5 Member Trophy Counts were:

* lilmissfoodie (2465) - So... Makes top 3 with over 4k donations this season, shatters the trophy record by 500 cups, and single handedly saved the review this week by taking screen shots for me. This guy... so much love! Thanks and grats!
* KENRRM (1809) - Kind of a big drop between first and second... but still respectable #2.
* cretodecristo (1735) - Hey! Welcome back to the top 5 :)  
* ohm fat-chen (1729) - Solid cups and solid donations. Tyvm Sir!
* ManVsMidi(1696) - m&amp;m does it again. :) 



**Trophy Count Top 3 All-time High Scores:**

**1st - lilmissfoodie (2465) - 07/21/13**

**2nd - ManVsMidi (1966) - 06/09/13**

**3rd - Awesome-O (1959) - 04/08/13**

----------

And then I saw a comment from /u/Amogh81602 that said ""Thats all fine but in all curiosity what the hell would they add in?"" (regarding the people who were complaining to not having an update for lower THs). (I'm new to posting, so if someone can show me how to do a link to his comment, that would be helpful, thanks).

No one answered him, but I kinda want someone to answer this question. I mean all supercell can really do is either add new lvls, add more buildings, or tweak/customize thing/add universal things (i.e. adding a specific request txt to the troop request). If they add new lvls they can only do it with with the higher THs. And if they add new buildings, then high lvl buildings (i.e. inferno tower/xbow) should only be added to higher lvl THs, and new buildings (i.e. dark barracks) will be placed where they will be placed. So what are you looking for when you ask for new stuff for lower lvl players?

And if you read other posts in these threads, people are right when they say that the THs 8 and below are pretty well balanced, with enough new buildings to buy/lvls to upgrade in each TH. Imagine if everything new that you would get and from THs 7-9 were all available to TH6, but there was still THs 7, 8, and 9, and the only things that were added for them were more cannons/archer towers/walls, and 1-2 lvls to upgrade. People would either gem through TH6, stay at TH6 cause the next THs had nothing worth getting (cause of the looting penalties, it would be better to stay at a lower lvl), or just get bored with the endlessness that would be TH6. Either way people would want new things to be added to the newer lvls so they can look forward to something and TH6 wouldnt be balanced at all. 

And as far as I see it, if you guys are the kind of people that wont proper lvl through a TH and look forward to what comes next in the following TH, then you shouldnt be the kind of people that will honestly care Bout having lvl 10-11 walls, seeing as the real competitive players (i.e. top 10+ players) rage their bombers so lvl 9-11 walls will all break all the same. 

And lastly, idc if you down/upvote this, cause im not here for the fame. But if you do downvote it, please give me a reason as to why you are downvoting it. Cause then if you don't give me a good/legit reason, that myself or anyone else can't prove wrong/unimportant, then you are just like all the other TH6s and below (not all of you, but enough) that are complaining either to look like they are part of something when they dont know anything, or not good enough to make it past TH6. And I've checked the stats, and the majority of those complaining bout this problem are TH6 and below.

Thank you for your time

P.S. I can admit when im wrong, but can you? I look forward to someone giving me a valid argument.

P.S.S. remember, SC doesnt have to be doing these updates, but they do.

1369100395.0,31,self.ClashOfClans,1eqhy1,Maxed or Not?,RedditYankee,38,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1eqhy1/maxed_or_not/,"Hey guys!  I have a subject I go over every once in a while with clan mates, especially the TH 5 and 6 guys, that I feel is something that most people around that level should take a look at.  As a little disclaimer, these are my opinions, and I feel that its the best way to upgrade your town hall at the lower levels, so don't get TOO mad.  So the conversation usually starts off with a member at TH 5 or 6 saying ""Ugh, blablabla is soo annoying"" referring to some building or troop they're upgrading.  I take a look at their base, and say ""Hey, upgrade your town hall. You're pretty far along"" and they say something like ""That's nooby"" or ""I'm not rushing Town Halls.""  

No.

The Maxing rule is not meant to be taken as ""Upgrade EVERY single thing you possibly can at a town hall level.""  I am a town hall 8, and I see no reason for level 5 balloons.  If I never use them, why upgrade them?  My balloons are level 3, and its fine there because Ive complete all the singleplayer missions and I dont find them useful in attacking.  That goes for troops, but I have even MORE ranting for buildings.

For example, if you have some level 5 walls at town hall 6 or something, its ok to leave them for a little bit.  When you're spending all of your time with a few elixir projects to finish, like some barracks to level 7 or something, don't just waste time at a town hall level waiting for them to finish.  So the bottom line is to follow my bottom line rules. (Nice name, 'eh?)

•Upgrade all defensive building before upgrading your town hall!
•Remember you can upgrade stuff WHILE your town hall is upgrading!
•Don't stress over upgrading walls/barracks/Unnecessary troop upgrades

This is something I think is a common wives tale (sort of) that I believe to be untrue.  So please, please don't waste weeks upgrading pointless stuff you don't need to upgrade and just upgrade your town hall.

tl;dr, Don't spend time not upgrading anything but a few walls and barracks at a town hall, just upgrade the Town Hall.

EDIT: Reading this, I see that it isn't the most relevant post on reddit, but I feel like its sort of important, and damn, I spent a good ten minutes writing it. Humph.

EDIT 2: The whole purpose of upgrading your town hall earlier rather than waiting, even though you expose your base to other higher level bases, and in the case of TH7 to 8 expose yourself to those nasty level 6 troops, you can now do the magical act of building more defenses and upgrading your current ones.  This way, you can protect your hard earned resources from those nasty level 5 and 6 troops.  So pretty much the thinking is you have to expose yourself to the mean big levels (Ever seen a level 20 on Global complaining about a level 50?) so that you can properly defend against them.

----------  

Welcome to Chapter 4, Multiplayer: Trophies, Experience, and Town Hall Level. In this chapter I’ll be explaining how matchmaking currently works as well as how this system is screwed up and ripe for abuse.

Once again I’ve been a bit slow at getting this chapter out because I’ve been busy. Between midterms (exams, essays) being sick (sucked), and group projects (sucked even more) I haven’t had a ton of time for Clash of Clans and the time that I have had I’ve spent uploading videos to [my YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/flammy5) (shameless shoutout). But really I would appreciate it if you checked out some of my content, it has a lot of advice and tips in it, if not in quite the structured environment that this strategy guide provides.

Anyway, moving on, this is one of my shorter chapters and I’m not breaking down a ton of different options, more just saying how the system works. As always, please provide feedback (loving or otherwise) as I do appreciate it.

**4.1 What are Trophies, Experience, and Town Hall Level?**  
Trophies are the golden cups on the top left of your interface, just below your name, level, and experience bar. You get trophies for winning multiplayer battles, either offensively or defensively. When attacking, if you get at least one star (50% of base destroyed or Town Hall destroyed) you will get trophies. If you do not get at least one star, you will lose trophies. The amount depends on your relative trophy counts (you vs your opponent). Getting one star results in getting ⅓ of the number trophies listed on the top left when attacking a base (just below the enemy resource count). Getting two stars means getting ⅔ of this amount, and getting 3 stars means you get the full amount. For one and two stars the count is rounded down.

Experience is gained for completing buildings. The amount varies non-linearly depending on the time it takes to complete and the resources it takes to complete (more expensive and slower = more experience). The exact amount of experience can be seen in blue text when a construction completes (similar animation to when collecting gold or elixir, the number is shown). Noteable, you do NOT get experience for upgrading walls, researching units, placing decorations, or buying traps. You also get a small amount of experience for removing natural decorations and destroying enemy town halls (amount dependant on your relative Town Hall levels).

Levels are gained by getting more experience. Level is ONLY good for getting a summary for how much someone has played and does not mean anything for multiplayer. You can appear ‘weaker’ by keeping your level low by under investing in resource collectors  and not collecting achievements (which give experience).

Upgrading the Town Hall results in unlocking more buildings and new buildings. Town Hall level does effect multiplayer in two ways: 

**4.2 How does Matchmaking work?**  
Matchmaking works completely on Trophies.

Level and experience don’t matter. Town Hall Level doesn’t matter (in terms of finding a match). Period. [I took this screenshot a while back when I had about 600 trophies. I was also level 40 or so as you can see from my large army.](http://i.imgur.com/zgriB.jpg) - Think TheDominator stands much of a chance?

Why is this a problem? Because each player can intentionally gain or lose trophies as they desire, essentially giving them a control to how hard they want their experience to be. This means that level 7 TH can come and ruin your day if they feel like it, just because they ditched some trophies and ended up at the same trophy count as you.

The recent patch (2.111, “Winter Update”) made it so you can only find matches who are worth 15-35 trophies if you three star them ^[1](http://forum.supercell.net/showthread.php/4798-Matchmaking-changes-21-11-2012). (Note, this is not the same as “within 35 trophies if you”) This restricts those you do find to a rather narrow sliver of players that are currently similar trophy counts as you.

**4.2.1 OMG! I just got attacked by someone XX levels higher than me!**  
Yeah. That is why this system sucks.

**4.3 Taking Advantage of the Trophy System**  
You can take advantage of the system now that you know how it works. Here are a few ideas...

**4.4 Abusing the system: Intentionally ditching trophies**  
As I mentioned, you can intentionally ditch trophies. You do this by attacking with a single unit, again and again. Each time you ‘lose’ and lose some trophies.

This means you will be in a lot less competitive environment. Those who view your base will often be of lower level. Even if they are also a high level player, they will know there are easier matches out there so they are more likely to skip you unless you have a ton of resources or some other reason to make it worth their time.

**4.5 Abusing the system even harder: Farming**  
Some players take ditching trophies to a whole new level: the farmers. These people drop to very few trophies (&lt;100 or &lt;300) then attack other farmers for gold. The basic idea is 1) stay at a low level so you don’t get attacked by people 3 starring you 2) raid other farmers and build up using natural income.

Note: There was an attempt to create a farming community before in which members voluntarily left their resources exposed. I am fairly sure this has fallen apart but if anyone has current information post it below or PM me and I’ll edit.

One thing that I DO use really low trophy counts for is boosting up my successful defenses to get the third level of the “Unbreakable” achievement. The second level is worth 50 gems and the third is worth 100. (At 200-300 trophies I get attacked 10+ times an hour, mostly from people lowering their trophy count, all resulting in wins)",,False,self,t5_2usfk,False,,reddit-clan clan-reddit,True,t3_13wswa,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/13wswa/clash_of_clans_strategy_guide_chapter_4/,

First of, i think deciding to use 7 days instead of the full league season to do this trophy push was a good idea. It was extremely tiring for both clans, i am sure. No doubt it will be awhile before either clans decide to find another war. 

Now straight to the statistics and results!

Starting trophies :
Zulu : 17254
Phi : 16901

Normally both clans aren't this high, some of us were excited for the war and decided to push higher since we were given quite some time to prepare before the war. 
A reminder that this war is not based on NET trophy gain, but TOTAL trophies at the end of the war.

Final trophy count for Zulu : 19351
Final trophy count for Phi :19155

Good job to both clans, especially Phi. I have to admit we were surprised at how fast they gained trophies and we had to do a little race at the very end. Congratulations to both clans for making it to the 19k cup mark regardless!

Statistics for Zulu :
Master league - 1
Crystal league -10
Gold league - 29
Silver league - 2
Badgeless - 3

Congratulations to the top 5 of zulu with :
Proxidal with 2597 trophies
Az@zel with 2329 trophies
Lasse with 2193 trophies
Rhino5651 with 2174 trophies
greyson194 with 2158 trophies

Top trophy hunter for TH 9 :
Proxidal with 2597 cups

Top trophy hunter for TH 8 :
Az@zel with 2329 cups

Top trophy hunter for TH 7 :
froztyJak with 1953 cups

Top trophy hunter for TH 6 :
Master Chief with 1537 cups

Once again, Good job to both Zulu and Phi for pushing, i know it is hard for the lower levels to push and Phi has some amazing people pushing to crystal, which i am sure Phi will be posting about :)

None of these are significant adds, just things to improve the interface of the game:

 - Inventory: It would be nice to have an inventory feature showing, at your townhall level, what walls/defenses/troops you have, what level they are at, and if they can still be upgraded.  This way I won't have to comb through my base looking for what else needs to be upgraded.
 - Additional information in training screen: Currently when setting troops to train, there is a counter showing how many total troops you will have once they are trained versus how many you can have.  It would be nice to see this expanded to show how many of each troop type you will have once troops are trained so I don't have to keep checking my camps to confirm I already have 12 barbs and only need to train 18 more.
 - Net resources gained/lost in a raid:  As part of the results screen after a raid, I'd like to see the value in elixir and gold of the troops and spells that I used in the raid, and a calculation of my net gain or loss of each as a result of the raid.

Sorry for TH8'ers looking for an updated base.

Hey Clashers!!

I have been getting a lot of request from my clanmates and forum users to update my TH8 Farming Base that gained a lot of popularity a few months ago when centralized Teslas was the new trend. 

Here's an old pic: ( this was Pre-3AD )
http://i.imgur.com/jbWhkn3.jpg


That being said, I still think centralized teslas is the way to go, but we had the recent change a few months back with regarding the wizard towers not misfiring when their current target is destroyed making overlapping wizard towers very strong IMHO.

I am going to show you 2 variations:

Variation 1: Original

http://i.imgur.com/GaDvZrf.jpg

This is the one that I will be using 99% of the time when i'm done with the majority of my elixir upgrades. 

The features:

- Balanced point defenses
- Storage prioritization ( 1 resource type + DE ) 
- Overlapping Wiz tower coverage for your protected storage 
- Funneling with Wiz towers covering the choke points.
-Balanced Traps

Current Issues:
2-14 walls to spare without destroying the funneling completely. I tried partitioning the center making 2 ""L's"" but that through of all the junctions. In addition, I have multiple T-junctions which I am aware of but at this time I don't have enough walls to fix each T-junction without offsetting another one. I'm going to test it as is and from here.

Variation 2: Customized for 8 storage protection.

http://i.imgur.com/zHyoTHd.jpg


This is the one I will be using at the early stages of TH9 as I still have a lot of elixir upgrades to do. This one is also showing my mortar location if and only if my DE is under 10k. I am currently focused on DE farming so I will have the DE storage in the middle 9 times out of 10 but I am getting ready to spend DE on AQ so I will move the storage out as there is no reason to protect what you don't have.  


What i'm looking for is TH9 users that are completed with their elixir upgrades and defenses in the 1500-2000 farming range. It's very hard to test bases when I am constantly upgrading defenses and lowbies tagging my TH  . If you plan on testing hit me up with a PM. If full - send me an email -misfitsofwar@gmail.com so we can keep in touch with your progress.

I will be continuing to adjust and adapt my base as I am still continuing to play with the design and fix the weak points. My base as it is now is a current mess with so many defensive buildings upgrading so disregard what it looks like ATM if you view my base ;p



Special shoutout to anzwarmonkey who's base inspired me to update mine with the focus on centralized/overlapping wiz towers vs the teslas ;p Big shoutout to all you base designers that have come up with me over the last 6 months - you know who you are! Respect.  

Thanks for all your support!!

Also known as the leader of reddit X-Ray.  First off, I would like to congratulate both clans for what was an exceptional week. Very well done (: The final score was EXTREMELY close, and I can say that there is no doubt in my mind that it could have gone either way. So without further ado, here are the results. 

Remember, the winning clan wasn't the clan WITH the most trophies, it's the clan that GAINS the most trophies or as some people like to call it ""the clan with the highest net gain"" When the competition first began, Reddit X-Ray had 11 698 trophies and Reddit Kappa had 12 657. So basically a difference of more or less one thousand trophies.
The final trophy counts (wich I took at exactly 10:02 pm pacific time) Were Reddit X-Ray 15 910 and Reddit Kappa 16 886. As you can see, the difference of our two clans is more or less one thousand trophies, so the results are very close.

Reddit X-Ray: net gain of 4 212
Reddit Kappa: net gain of 4 229
17 trophies was the deciding number, and unfortunately for our clan it didn't go in our favor. :/ Needless to say, both clans did a terrific job, however Reddit Kappa managed to trump us. 

Kudos to Reddit Kappa, who lost a total of 4 members during the course of the competition, and still emerged victorious (and 4 people is a HUGE amount of people to lose, wether you're doing a net gain or a total trophy competition) I tip my hat to you (:

For our first clan war (or at least first clan war since i've been leader) I believe that we did all we could, but just fell short of the gold. In the future, I hope to have even more members of our clan participate, and also to have our sweet vengance with Kappa (;

Also, congrats to ""Wouter"" of reddit Kappa. Crystal || isn't easily obtained! :D 

Keep on clashing! 
-Cavemonstr

With your help, we can make this into an awesome resource for everyone out there. I have a few ideas I want to share with you. 

* **Link Flair!** I've set up a system so that you can tag your HIMB posts. Not only will this help those searching for ideas, but it will reduce the clutter in our sub and help organize. To use link flair just click the [flair button on your post](http://i.imgur.com/AL451g5.jpg) and select HIMB. Also, keep an eye out for new flair down the road!

* **Contests!** Hopefully, if I can work it out, I'm going to be throwing HIMB contests for each TH level 6-9. We'll create a modpost, and the contest will run for one week. Most upvoted base wins a prize! This is also going to help me jumpstart my long term project of revitalizing the sidebar HIMB master thread.

* **FAQ!** I'll be watching for the most asked questions over the next month or so, and adding your best answers to the FAQ. 

* **Reddiquette!** I just wanted to give everyone a reminder to please observe [good reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and do not downvote posts simply because you don't like them.

So most people are going to be confused as to what I mean, well what's going to happen is that Me (leader of Reddit Eta and elder in Reddit Silver) and the other leaders are going to be monitoring the donations between the regular (no elders or leaders) members of every official Reddit clan. The top 5 (maybe more depending on the number of clans registered) donators between every clan will win $10 itunes gift cards. The competition will last the full fortnight. There are three rules, only two people can win from each clan (unless you're in reddit silver in which case 4 people can win from that clan because that was the first Reddit clan I was in and I love it), to enter you must have your clan leader message me on reddit or post a comment on the post I made in the subreddit for the leaders and again only regular members can win the first competition the competition will last 2 weeks/a fortnight and will begin in 1 day and 5 hours aka the 20000 gem competition between the top 3 clans. Because I do love the elders and leaders too there will be a separate competition for them with essentially the same rules. So far the registered clans are Reddit Kilo, Reddit, Reddit Silver, Reddit Mu, Reddit Eta, Reddit Nu, Reddit Theta, Reddit Indy, Reddit Charlie, Reddit Omicron, Reddit beta, Reddit Echo (he's also supplying two giftcards for the elders and leaders competition so **** yeah go him!) Reddit Xi, Reddit Tango, Reddit Spartans, Reddit Kings, Reddit Yankee, Reddit United, Reddit Pi, Reddit November, Reddit Mike, Reddit Kappa, Reddit Rho, Reddit Oak, Reddit Whiskey, Reddit Lima and Reddit Gold. Don't see your clans name up here? Get your clan leader to message me! Do you think I'm missing something or have any questions? Post 'em in the comment section below... PS this has been approved by flammy and is definitely a real competition.  TL;DR (which you lazies should anyway) Donations competition, winners get $10 in iTunes gift cards.

My name is LosPharmD and I am the leader of Reddit Indy, a humble member of the Clash of Clans Subreddit Clan Network. This is a biweekly recap of the goings on in our clan, feel free to check out whats going on and drop us a comment on how you think we did! Always love the feedback! We have 2 open spots this week so please feel free to apply in game if you see a spot available and think you can keep up with the activity requirements. Don't forget the password!


    ----------

**Clan Leader Corner:**

Steam rolling right along into Season 2 of the League experiment. Bonus' just too low to really warrant the additional difficulty and infrequency of loot at higher cups... For that reason, and also because we are insane, we decided to have a trophy push this season to see how high we can climb on the leader boards! Haha. Should be fun to get out of farm mode for a few weeks and see where we rank among the elite. Stay tuned for the results!

* Clan Rules: We decided to drop the trophy requirement for membership, most seem to stay above this anyway and if someone wants to try their hand at sub 200 farming, who are we to stop them. The donation requirement is 150 troops donated each week and 300 per season. Two seasons within the 300-400 range will also count as inactivity, as well. Clan members are required to donate to all open requests before requesting troops of their own. Lastly, any new members applying to the clan should be able to donate Level 5 archers or above and also be willing to meet the above requirements.

* We will be opening up for applications to be promoted to elder this season as well. We will compile the applicants this week and announce the winners at next seasons review. Any interested member please send me a private message on Reddit and include:

* In game name
* Age
* Location
* Why you want to be an elder (what can you bring to the table)?


And now on with the epic stats!

    ----------


**Donations:**

This season the average clan member donated **1372** troops. That is down from 1402 troops last season. Our median donation count was **650**. The overall donations went down to **61703** from 72431. This is the first week in the last 10 weeks our donation count has actually decreased from the previous week. Plateau or just a bump in the road, we will see!

Top 10 Donators for this week:

* KENRRM (10111) - So... when Ken maxes out elixir he goes on drag-fest and donates absurd amounts of troops! More then the next 3 members combined. No way he could top this! Great job!
* Big Andy's Army (3216) - Jumping up from the number 6 spot. Quietly putting in work. Well done!
* george (3192) - New member this season and ranks in the top 3! Thats the kind of recruit we like to see! Way to go!
* michel (3032) - Toping the charts for the elders this week. Michel proves he can be a consistant donation machine.
* Awesome-O (2884) - Newly upgraded lvl 6 troops makes this number oh so much sweeter!
* LosPharmD (2824) - My mini minions carry me on black wings to the bmber 6 spot! 
* lilmissfoodie (2789) - First member in the clan to reach level 6 archers, still donating like a champ. Love it!
* Killerd (2488) - Moving up 1 spot to number 8, killer keeping it real beastie boyz style!.  
* c0copopps (2008) -  Last member to break the 2k mark. The swedish sensation is back!
* Pedro (1907) - He will not be denied a spot on the leader board. Squeezing into the top 10 this week, pedro consistent as always! Thank you!


**Donation All-time High Score: KENRRM (10111) - 05/12/13**


    ----------


**Trophy Counts (Current Clan Rank 11680):**

Our Clans Overall Trophy Count this week is **14691** and our average Trophy count for our members was **1372**. The median trophy count this week was **1382** and the average change was **-27** trophies. We fell almost 3000 spots as many members settled in to farm at lower trophy counts. 

Top 5 Member Trophy Counts were:

* ggout (1677) - Tops the list this week!
* killerd (1599) - Breaks into the list for the first time in a while. 
* LosPharmD (1531) - Must be a slow week if I made it into the top 3. Woot for me! 
* Alred13 (1509) - Just into 1500 territory. 
* parsi (1503) - Another one sneaking above 1500.

Top 5 Most Improved Trophy Counts were:

* Karloz (+369) - 1070 to 1439! 
* ggout (+185) - 1492 to 1677!

If you don't want to, fine, that's your prerogative, and you can do that thanks to those of us who do.

For those of you who do use gems, I would recommend that you first use them for builder huts. However, having 5 builders after your resource generators and barracks are done is kind of a waste since you most likely won't want to be upgrading 4 defenses at the same time (one free for maintenance and wall upgrades).

After that, using gems on resources to start upgrades gives you the best ROI. Once you start using them to speed things up (either upgrades, resource collecting, spell creation, etc), you get less return for your gems. Although, it does speed up your gameplay, which may be worth it to you... your choice.",,False,self,t5_2usfk,1363823584.0,,Shield14,True,t3_1aof5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1aof5m/whats_with_all_the_gemmer_hatred/,

I want to start by saying that I have only bought gems once, the $5 pack to get the fourth builder and have never used gems to speed up jobs by more then an hour or so before bed. [Here is my current base and various other supporting screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/ifMMl) I upgraded to TH8 on March 11 and today is August 7th, a total of 149 days. I know that I have 2 jobs that are not yet done but I also have had 2 idle workers for the past day or 2 so lets call it even. Looking at the [cumulative cost calculator on the wiki](http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Cumulative_Costs), TH8 has a total of 401.5 days of builder time and 143 days of research time. To this I add the building cost of my lvl3 barbarian king of 1.5 days (which I did not have at TH7) for a total of 403 days. I have had 4 builders for the entireity of TH8 so my effective build time is 100.75 days and I have not upgraded all the dark elixir troops so my total research time spent is 101 days.

However, I did have significant carry over costs from TH7 since not every building was maxed. [Here is my base just prior to upgrading to TH8](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/19wymt/my_preupdate_never_3starred_th7_base/). I did not have a dark barracks at TH7 so that adds 8 days. I had a lvl4 and a lvl3 air defense which both could have been at lvl5, so that adds 17 days. Only one of my barracks was maxed at lvl9 at TH7 (the others at 7, 7, and 8), for a total of 16 more days. Finally, my mines and collectors were way under leveled, I am going to assume that they were all at lvl7 going into TH8 for simplicitys sake, for a total of 120 more days (10 days to take 1 pump/mine from 7 to 11 times 12 pumps/mines). Finally I had about 3 days of carry over cost from the second elixir storage. This makes for a grand total of 164 more builder days, or 41 days with 4 builders. I also had at least 5 days of carry over research cost from lvl2 minions and I think several balloon upgrades, so lets call it an even 10 days of carry over research cost.

There were several updates that also changed the build times of various buildings, (specifically labratory lvls 5&amp;6, dark barracks decreased, dark elixir drill, gold mine, elixir pump, dark barracks again), but by and large they changed before I was able to upgrade them so they are mostly a wash.

Therefore I have a grand total of **141.75** days of construction costs in real world days (with 4 builders) and 111 days of research time. It took me **149** days to do it which is just over **95%** efficient.

TL;DR You too can achieve a totally awesome base and reach high level town halls, it just takes a small amount of time at very regular intervals.

* *What is This All About?*  
**Reddit Troopers** is the first of the [new generation of Reddit Clans](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/wiki/reddit_clans)!  
As you might know from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1iypiz/the_reddit_clan_system_is_opening_to_new_clans/), future Reddit Clans can be created by anyone meeting the qualifications.  These clans can then become Verified Reddit Clans if they grow and persist in following the rules.  

* *Who are You?*  
I am the Clan Leader for Reddit Troopers.  I was a Clan Elder for the venerable Reddit Hotel Clan for a long time.  When the Reddit CoC moderators decided to start a new Reddit Clan system, they approached me and offered me a chance to create a new clan!  
My wife and I became fans of CoC shortly after its release and have always been members of Reddit Hotel, so I was delighted to be able to take part in the growth of the Reddit Clan system which housed us for so long.  

* *Who are the Clan Elders?*  
Reddit Trooper's Clan Elders consist of trusted veterans from Reddit Hotel.  They volunteered to come over and help kick-start the new clan, and I am truly grateful for their help and support.  There won't be any concerns about rogue Elders going on a rampage and kicking half the clan - all these players have been solid clan-mates for many months and have proven to be mature, friendly, and responsible.  

* *What's the Plan?*  
Our goal is to become a Verified Reddit Clan, and to be known as a mainstay of the Reddit Clan system!  We have already have quite a few members, and will formally apply for Verification once we reach the required 25 members.  
As a Social clan we do not require high trophy counts, but clan activites might include voluntary trophy pushes with some friendly competition with other Reddit Clans.

* *Are there Requirements to Join?*  
As with all Reddit Clans, you must read through all the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/wiki/official_reddit_clan_system#wiki_3_-_what_are_the_social_clan_rules.3F) before applying.  Since we're a Social clan, the main requirement is maturity and friendliness!  Eventually we will be enforcing a Troop Donation requirement of 200 troops per cycle.  

Join now, and be with the Reddit Troopers on the path to conquest and fun!  I hope to see more Reddit Clans follow in our footsteps, and I wish everyone the best of luck!  

Clash On!  
Rejuvyn

My name is LosPharmD and I am the leader of Reddit Indy, a humble member of the Clash of Clans Subreddit Clan Network. This is a biweekly recap of the goings on in our clan, feel free to check out whats going on and drop us a comment on how you think we did! Always love the feedback! We have 3 open spots this week so please feel free to apply in game if you see a spot available and think you can keep up with the activity requirements. Don't forget the password!

**Clan Leader Corner:**

New Update this Season and look at all the awesome stuff for TH7, 8, and 9.... ok not much but hey we have all that cool stuff to look forward to a year from now right? :) The rest of us will have to be happy with new graphics, barracks arrows, and global chat with a bunch of pictures in it. There was one interesting thing impacting the review which was the new troops received statistic which will allow us to look at the ratios of Donated troops to Received troops. I will post the first seasons number here even though it only counts received for the second half. It might give some other leaders an insight into our numbers which could prove helpful.

* Clan Rules: The donation requirement is 150 troops donated each week and 300 per season. Two seasons within the 300-400 range will also count as inactivity, as well. Clan members are required to donate to all open requests before requesting troops of their own. Lastly, any new members applying to the clan should be able to donate Level 5 archers or above and also be willing to meet the above requirements.

* Since we dropped the trophy requirements, I will also stop reporting trophy change information. Too many people bouncing around for that to be relevant. I'll still post the top trophy counts but the change is becoming pretty meaningless. 

And now on with the epic stats!

    ----------


**Donations:**

This season the average clan member donated **1266** troops. That is down from 1372 troops last season. Our median donation count was **783**. The overall donations went down to **60261** from 61703. Average troops received was **300** and the Average Ratio (D/R) was **7.2**.

Top 10 Donators for this week:

* KENRRM (8011) - Ken drops 2k donations from last week but still remains on top. The Ken and everyone else show continues! Good work, sir!
* c0copopps (5504) - Jumping up from the number 9 spot. Giving Ken a run for his money!
* LosPharmD (3043) - 200 more donations then last week boosts me to number 3. Tyvm!
* lilmissfoodie (2363) - Indy leadership proving we are contenders. Foodie slides into fourth.
* killerd (2266) - Second elder to make the list. Nice work!
* michel (2266) - Week after week, always putting in strong numbers! 
* george (2209) - Relativly new member really proving he is a donation phenomena!
* Big Andy's Army (1954) - Just a few shy of the 2k mark. BAA is def a donations BA.  
* Rexy (1602) -  Another new member this season, making his mark on the boards.
* Brad (1594) - Brad's been missed on the leader boards. Good to see him make the top 10.

Our Clans Overall Trophy Count this week is **14541** and our average Trophy count for our members was **1266**. The median trophy count this week was **1318** and the average change was **-96** trophies. We fell almost 3000 spots as many members settled in to farm at lower trophy counts. 

Top 5 Member Trophy Counts were:

* Michael (1818) - Newest member comes in on a high!

**More Flexibility**
Now that I, personally, am at the point, where I have 3-4 builders, I want to be able to do more with them.



**Multiple Builders Per Upgrade**
A lot of times, I have an upgrade that has 2 days left, with 2 free builders and no resources to use. I would like to be able to use multiple builders per build doubling the speed, and then being able to take extra ones off the build as I want.

**Boost Builders**
The boost could be for the whole project, or a set rate, like 1 gem for 3 minutes, 5 gems for 20 minutes, etc. Thanks to [Chief Maximos92] (http://www.reddit.com/user/maximos92) for this idea!



**Reassigning a Builder**
I want to be able to temporarily stop (as an example) upgrading a cannon to level 5. It still wouldn't be able to be used, but I would still be able to use the builder for another project, and put it back to the original one when it's done.



**Queuing**
This one is simple. Be able to make a list of what you want builders to upgrade, and as soon as one is done, and there are enough resources available, it goes immediately to that upgrade.



These were just some ideas I've thought of over the last week. If you have any about builders yourself, feel free to put them in the comments, and thanks for reading!



TL;DR I want builders to be more flexible, be able to use multiple builders for one project, and make line for what I want upgraded, as long as I have enough resources.",,False,self,t5_2usfk,1366157834.0,,reddit-clan clan-Spartans,True,t3_1chy1w,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1chy1w/suggestions_about_builders/,

Of course now i know i was completely wrong but it makes me wonder whether Single Player defence would be a pretty cool addition.

You'd randomly get attacked (when you don't have a shield)  and the higher level you are the more forces attack you. Or maybe rather than them being random you could choose levels, a bit like what we have now in SP but rather than them being bases to attack you work your way up bigger armies and if they don't get any stars you get three stars but the more stars they get the less you earn. These  armies could be based off our current available units such as Barbarians and Archers or it could be Goblin themed with all different kinds of Goblin enemies.

For example, line up nine archers in ONE barrack. Note how many gens you have.
Cue up another archer, see how it now takes two gems to finish them all?
Drop it back down to nine.
Next bit is a little fiddley.
Very quickly tap on the archer, and then the gem button. You will get the extra archer before the gem sign changes, so you can train ten archers for 1 gem. 
Wow! One whole archer. I suppose you can do it with drags and pekkas too!

Anyways, enjoy it!

EDIT: works with pekkas and dragons, just tested. Now it really IS a bug. Yu can train two pekka for 15 gems, or two drags for ten gems...

For example

Lvl 2 barracks: 10% reduction time for archers and barbs

Lvl 3 barracks: 10% reduction for gobs and additional 10% off the already existing time so archers would take ~20seconds to make

and so on with addition reductions so at lvl 10 archers would only take about 10 seconds to make

I thank you for all the feedback that was given which gave me ideas to go further in depth with the break down of each base. 

[Base](http://i.imgur.com/sQ4QMYL.jpg)

This base design is something I just through together with minimal thought. The first 15 attacks my lvl 6 mortar was being built. The range of Gold and Elix is due to when I made a big purchase with my resources to being an upgrade (lvl 6 Mortar, 2 lvl 9 Barracks, lvl 8 Barracks, ~30 lvl 7 Walls)


**So lets start with where this was tested at:**

* Trophy Count: 1520-1805

* Trophy Average: 1730

* Elixir Amount: 200k-2m

* Gold Amount: 50k-1.8m

* Dark Elixir Amount: 3k-5.6k

* Trophies Gained: 328

* Trophies Lost: 87

* Largest Percent Lost: 56%

**Short Breakdown**

The North and South exterior walls are there solely to funnel goblins, archers, and barbarians while at the same time making it difficult for players who use wall breakers (not many at the trophy range tested at). 

The walls to the West and East: [click here](http://i.imgur.com/1V3IWDi.jpg)

They are 3 spaces away from the defences. This makes it so archers are forced to come in closer to the defense and allow the mortars in the middle of the base to target them. 

While my Dark Elixir was lower than 4.5k I had my Clan Castle and Dark Elixir storaged positioned: [like so](http://i.imgur.com/3yLtqOr.jpg)

Which was very effective since my clan castle units were able to reach the northside of the TH.

And finally the battle log: [Battle Log](http://imgur.com/a/chlv4)

Hopefully you all find this helpful. I will be starting my next design soon. 

See you all next week!

**What to Expect Next Week**

* Farming Base Design.
* Protecting DE, 2 Gold, 2 Elix Storages.

1361803320.0,21,self.ClashOfClans,196yqu,Weekly base design testing series: What do you all think about it?,PleaseGetGood,23,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/196yqu/weekly_base_design_testing_series_what_do_you_all/,"I was thinking about creating a series in which I will take some time to design new/unique base designs and post how well it will hold at a higher trophy count.


What this series will include:


1) Redesign of my base each week(so long as time permits between work and school)


2) Create both farming and trophy count based designs.

3) Keep the design for a whole week and keep a high trophy count(1500+)

4) Post an image of the design

5) Post the whole weeks battle log


Why high trophy count?

That way you know that the design will do better than at a lower trophy count.

Why TH8?

I am TH8 and this is the TH where most players will settle down and upgrade everything before going to TH9.


Disclaimer: This will only be a TH8 base design since that is what I have. I do not think I am the ""best"" or anything like that, just think it will be interesting to see how my designs do since in the past they have been successful and might help out a few of you Flammy Fans:)

So what do you think? Waste of my time or will you all benefit from it?

Thanks,

###Clash Of The Reddit Clans Holiday Competition!
  
.

##When?  

Right now thru January 7th, 11:59 PM PST (Two weeks total)
  
## What? 

A chance to win subreddit respect, bragging rights for your clan, and internet points!   (and maybe awesome subreddit related prizes) 

## How? 

Gather together as many Trophies as you can to help your clan win! The *clan* with the largest *change* in clan trophies by the end will win! 

That means: This is a competition based on NET GROWTH of Trophy count, not on amount of trophies. In other words, the clan that gains the most trophies in the week will be the winner. And the most admired. And probably the coolest.

##  Why?

Do you NEED another reason to pillage, Chief? 

## Prizes? 

Fabulous prizes may be ~~created~~ announced later. :)

## But wait! There is more...!

If you manage to attack another Redditor's base (as evidenced by their clan castle claiming to belong to another Reddit clan) submit photo evidence of your feat for a bonus of +10 trophies PER STAR you manage to claim! (But if they successfully revenge you, they get +20 trophies per star they get in their revenge, once again evidence must be submitted) 

Also, prizes may be awarded for the largest personal gain in trophies. Keep track of your own trophy count from the start of the competition to the end! (I've got a record of all of you're counts so no cheating!) 

## Count me in! What now? 

What are you still doing here? 


**There is GLORY to be won! There are villages to be DEMOLISHED!! And most important of all, TROPHIES TO BE CLAIMED!!** 

Go on, and enjoy the first competition in this Subreddit's history, may it be the first of many. 


**And have a fantastic holiday season! :)**

|Clan Name|Starting Trophies|Ending Trophies|
|:-------------:|:---:|:---|
|Reddit|12517|13074|

|Reddit Delta|10223|12088| 
|Reddit Echo|10859|13269|

Note: Reddit Foxtrot (with 30 members as of the start), and any other new clans created during the competition would have an unfair advantage due to the nature of the winners. Next time! (Foxtrot Start: 7948, for the record. Foxtrot Members can still participate in Individual Best Increase contest)

Just like bombs and spring traps, you set the radius of your spell in an area of your base, and whenever an enemy troop gets into the circle, the spell activates. Obviously rage spells and healing spells are something you wouldn't use, but freeze and lightning would really mess up some attacks. This would also open room for spells like a ""freedom"" spell or something, where it inactivates any spell traps or something.

Tell me what ya think. This may be a shot in the dark for support, but I thought it was a cool idea.",,False,self,t5_2usfk,False,,,True,t3_1jwcul,http://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/1jwcul/new_defense_idea_for_bases_spell_traps/,

Yesterday marked the conclusion of the one week clan war between Echo and Silver.  I believe the war accomplished what Le Noobeh (Silver Leader) and I had hoped, which was to increase activity and enthusiasm and push our members to accomplish new personal bests.


Format:  7 days duration, net trophy gain was the deciding statistic.


Reddit Silver Starting Trophy Count:  15345
Reddit Echo Starting Trophy Count:  14909


Reddit Silver Ending Trophy Count:  16620
Reddit Echo Ending Trophy Count:  19457 


Silver Net Gain: 1275
Echo Net Gain:  4548 ** Winner


Thanks Silver for the battle, I know we had a blast!  

We were watching both Silver and the Zulu vs Phi battle, so watching all of the clans push motivated us to the totals you see above.  It made for an exciting week. We had some issues with inactives/vacations, but the rest of the team pushed through to cover the difference.  Great Job Everyone!


Some accolades from the Echo side:

+ New milestone - we reached Clan Rank 1688, a new record for Echo

Echo Top 10:


* 1YardStare TH10 2538 Trophies 1048 net gain Highest TH10

From 24-31st July Reddit Zulu will be having our first ever clan war, and we arranged it with our fellow redditor, Reddit Phi.

This was made to wish our friendly competitors luck, as well as allow Phi members to post up comments as well.

Please note, no harsh comments please, this is just a friendly competition between 2 reddit clans, dont take it too seriously :)

GOOD LUCK for both clans!
