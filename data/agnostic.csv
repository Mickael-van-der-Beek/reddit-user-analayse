I refuse to have my well thought out philosophy that took me 25 years to cultivate dismissed by the 14 year old edgy atheism movement, so they can add another number to their team.",reallifeagnostic,210,35,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/18tons/being_an_agnostic_is_a_thing_i_refuse_to_have_my/,"The typical, ""agnostic isn't a noun.""  and ""you're an atheist"" comment came up yesterday in r/atheism.  This was one of my responses.  I'm new to this sub, but I do have an opinion on the matter of agnosticism.  Here might be a decent summation of it.

I've run across the sentiment on Reddit for a while now, that being an agnostic literally isn't a thing.  That I am either an atheist or theist, and agnostic refers to my knowledge.  This couldn't be more wrong.  This was one of my responses to one of your typical r/atheists who are looking to lump in us agnostics with their base.  When an atheist tells me there is no such thing as an agnostic, I find it tremendously dismissive.  How do you feel about this?





---
If you're arguing that atheists have nothing to benefit from broadening their base and lumping agnostics in with them, I'd have to disagree, and also say that's an entirely separate argument and one we can probably have a good discussion about. I looked at the chart you linked, and I'm just gonna have to disagree with it. If I were to make up my own belief chart, it wouldn't be binary, or have quadrants, it would be a venn diagram. Agnostic being the center circle, atheist and theist being the outer circles. Most if not all people are slightly agnostic in their views, meaning, they believe one way or the other, but they also hold some doubt. That's why agnostic would be the center circle. Some people are hard theists, not willing to even admit to any doubt, and on the other end, you have hard atheists, who are unwilling to concede that the possibility of a god is even remotely plausible. In the center, you have pure agnostics, ie people like me who legitimately are not theists or atheists and are comfortable with calling themselves agnostics. Once again, I am an agnostic, through and through. Some days I have inclinations that there is a creating force in the universe, sometimes my mind leads me into more atheistic places where I just feel like this is all random chance. Some days I'm legitimately not on either side and I maintain the belief that I have no clue at all whether or not God exists. I'm not apathetic to the God question. If evidence comes out to support a God claim I am all ears and am curious. If evidence comes out to disprove God I am also curious and all ears. I see the profoundness in certain teachings of religion, but I also see the profoundness in the atheistic concept of being in complete control of one's reality.
I'll also add that it's logically incorrect to do what you're doing, in that you're dismissing my given definitions of agnostic, atheist, and theist, and yet you're linking me to your own given definitions. If I'm to throw out my definitions, you have to expect me to then ask you to throw away yours.
Another thing to note, is that, it's only been as of recent years that the definitions of atheism, agnostic, and theist began changing, mainly due to the rise of internet atheism. It's not like any new evidence has come out to disprove God. The same logic is still used, by an large, and yet, the definitions have changed. I won't assume that it is an attempt to broaden the atheist base, but at the same time, I won't deny the plausibility of this being the case.
I want you to look up what has happened recently in regard to NDT's wikipedia account. Whoever first wrote the article included that he was an atheist. NDT saw this, and went in to change it to agnostic. It got changed back to atheist. NDT changed it again. Again it was changed to atheist. Eventually the back and forth ceased, but not before NDT realized that the atheist community was indeed trying to have him on their team, so to speak. I'm no NDT, but you're kind of doing the same thing to me right now. I'm an agnostic.",,False,,t5_2qjrd,1361292966.0,,,True,t3_18tons,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/18tons/being_an_agnostic_is_a_thing_i_refuse_to_have_my/,

After searching for an agnostic sub and browsing this one; it feels genuine, but under used. I'd love to see more people contributing and joining for intelligent discussion on the matter. If you have any tips on how to tell people about this subreddit that would be great. As far as why I chose this belief I'll hopefully provoke discussion. I believe we can only ultimately rely on our bodily senses and extensions of them. What does that mean?
We have at least 5 senses and scientists are claiming we have many more (which I agree with). We can only learn from using our senses (but how can we trust them). If we believe that everyone else has those same senses and that the majority is telling the truth on the data received then we can believe the conclusion from personal data acquirement. This has miraculously been extended to create machines that no longer need a concluded majority because logic teaches us these machines are reliable. (Talking about the thousands of machines in science today that can do things our senses can't.) We can trust them because they don't deliver false data. If they do, we can double check with another test and it should conflict with the previous (there are argument's of knowing when data is off that I will not get into now)

So what does this have to do with a deity?

Basically, any evidence of the after life has not presented itself in any detectable form, yet evidence of the opposite (that there is nothing after life) can never be provided as well.

It seems to me that the vast majority of atheists and agnostics become this way because they resort to *pure* reason when constructing their beliefs. Of course when you erase all religions from your frame of belief, those religious concepts aren't coming back. A lot of people are left content with the idea that there's no god.

I'm completely agnostic. I still haven't really been able to decisively lean one way or the other on the god vs. no god debate. However, I do believe that if there is a ""god"", he's not at all human and is most likely of a form that is absolutely unable to be comprehended by us. That's just my view. I don't believe this god facilitates life at all. I don't think he created humans. I think we're just the result of *perfect* conditions for creating self-aware machines.

Now, about death. To understand what ""death"" really is, I think the most important part of it is the fact that the brain shuts down. And when the brain shuts down, the life stops. It's done. Almost *every single* atheist or agnostic I've ever met seems to have the belief that death is death, and there is nothing but eternal emptiness devoid of thought or existence. This is where my belief splits off.

Alright. You're just gonna have to bear with me on what I'm going to explain, because it's something that I've had difficulty putting into words. It makes complete sense in my head (trust me), so please just hear me out.

Okay, so, back to death. The brain shuts down for good. No more me. Well, is that really true? What makes me ""me""? What separates me from my father, from my dog, from that tree, and from a rock? We're all matter and as far as humans go, we're all VERY similar. So again, what makes me ""me""? In my view, what makes the consciousness is a system of information. It is facilitated by the chemical reactions and electrical signals in the body, and is comprised of many different tenets such as identity, self-awareness, and sense. Each consciousness is slightly different, and I'm not really sure where to draw the line between conscious and not conscious (somewhere between human and rock). 

The birth and development of a human is a remarkable way to create and foster this system of information that I'm calling a ""consciousness"". There could be other ways of creating a consciousness. In fact, any system of information with sufficient connections and capacity could become conscious as humans are (e.g. supercomputers). 

So, let's say that SOMEWHERE out there in time and space, perhaps even in a different *universe*, there exists a system of information. Perhaps it's atoms interacting in the hot core of some asteroid. Perhaps it's intergalactic particles roaming around colliding with one another. Or perhaps it's even in a supercomputer developed by some post-human civilization. What's *special* about this particular system of information is that it's EXACTLY similar to your consciousness the MOMENT that you died. The biological mechanisms of your Earthly body may have failed, but that does not mean your consciousness just needs to stop. If this system of information is sustainable (unlike the human body), then your mind would continue on into the afterlife. There's no reason that it wouldn't! We have no reason to suspect that consciousnesses are tied to any particular point in space or time.

Now, of course this theory hinges on a few different things. The first I can think of is: What if the universe is never able to create the correct system of information that would allow you to continue? What I have to say to that is that we have no idea how big the universe is. Hell, we already know that simply what we can see is unfathomably huge. I don't consider this a compelling argument because I'm in no position to underestimate the size of the universe (and time, for that matter).

I'm not exactly sure what sparked it but I was about to say something and he proclaimed in an angry sarcastic tone"" oh what you think it was aliens? your an idiot, aliens don't exist."" I was very confused at this outburst as I didn't even mention anything to do with aliens at the time,although I often joke about aliens. I explained that I believe there are aliens somewhere in the universe and that idk if they have ever been here. to which he said it is a fact that aliens do not exist and neither does God. 

Again, I never mentioned God. I was very confused at this point as to why he was berating me about aliens and God. He went on to proclaim that all life is an accident and that we are apes and all that jazz. I explained that that's one way of looking at it but I haven't seen enough proof to stake my entire existence on it and that there is at least a possibility that some sort of creator could exist and that as humans,well, apes i guess don't know everything.

I asked him if the universe had a beginning or if it has existed forever to which he had no answer. I asked him how I could just take his word on whether there is a creator or not if he doesn't even know if the universe is infinite or had a beginning. Unwilling to accept that he(nor I) knew everything he called me ""psychotic"" and told me I needed help. He told me I was being a fucking idiot and left.

I was born into a Catholic family.

What really led me to become agnostic was, first, science. Looking at all evolution theory, la di da, this and that, looking at a million galaxies out there just opened my eyes to alot more possibilities. 

Secondly, the thought of every other religion is wrong and mine is right. It just doesn't add up. There's no way that legit good people are going to burn in hell because simply they do not believe in Jesus as the catalyst between Heaven and Earth. 

Third, is my believe that religion is a man made thing, to control weaker minded people by fear and reward. It's a political tool, it contains power. 

Heck I'm 19 and I really don't know where to start to explain of how lost and curious I am. 

Mind you I still believe in a greater power out there (God?). I didn't lose faith in God, I just lose faith in the system.

In my early teen years, my friends considered themselves Christians, so I did too. Later, many of them became hardcore Atheists, and after thinking about religion in depth for the first time when I got into high school, they seemed pretty spot on. 

So, I go through High School as an Atheist, pissed at religion for making people do stupid things, wanting to mock people in churches, general dickish/rebellious things like that. I was, and still am, somewhat of a punk.

Around my senior year, I have a completely different group of friends, more varying in beliefs than my old ones. They're all good people despite belief, and I found out it's not the belief that's screwed up at the core, it's the people. I learn about the hard-core atheists who can be just as bad as religious zealots, and finally I realize that both beliefs are arrogant and rely on faith, which is a completely invalid way to answer the great mysteries of life.

So, here I am, a reformed Atheist who strives not to use belief as reasoning. I've found it helps me listen and understand why people believe what they believe rather than arguing it with them.

If you reach a certain intelligence and you haven't found proof for God/s you become an agnostic. 

I think that i don't ""know"" if there is a god. I haven't met him or anything like that. But i see the possibility for a god or gods. I also see a possibility that everything is just simple coincidence or we are just in some sort of simulation like the Matrix or anything else you could think of or couldn't. I think all of the possibilitys are possible and they are so at the same percentage of chance. So with my knowledege right now it makes no sense to choose one of them over the other. If i ever find proof for one or the other i will become a believer in that theory. For example if would meet a god or whatever i probably become religious. But i would never start believing just because someone tells me that there is a god or we all live in the ""Matrix"". I need to decide for myself based on my own experiences and thoughts.

For now i just accept not knowing and i won't choose a side. I'll just be happy and stay agnostic for now. I hope there are others who think similar. Have a great day with wich ever believe you have!

&gt; **Not Sure.**

&gt; Anyone who expresses a more definitive response to the question is claiming access to knowledge not based on empirical foundations. This remarkably persistent way of thinking, common to most religions and some branches of philosophy, has failed badly in past efforts to understand, and thereby predict the operations of the universe and our

Are answers to these questions even possible without expressing a
profound bias of human sentiment? Of course humans were not around to ask these questions for 99.9999% of cosmic history. So if the purpose of the universe was to create humans then the cosmos was embarrassingly inefficient about it.

While we know that ""others"" have allegedly tested something, formed theories and in some cases proven them, we ourselves have not tested and proven every belief we hold. As an example, it takes light roughly 8 minutes to reach the earth from the sun. I believe this blindly, I have never tested it, I believe it because I believe that others have and I trust their information.

Even a scientist is only an expert in their chosen field. A brain surgeon may not have personally tested global warming theories.

1. An average person has no proof that scientific evidence is true
2. An average person trusts experts in a field to explain scientific evidence as true
3. The average person believes in most aspects of science that they can not personally test only because they have read it or been told it by a trusted source
4. The way the average person takes this belief in is similar to the way early man gained ""knowledge"" of religions. They were told that things happened because of magic and believed the trusted source.

Now let us look at the average religious person, lets pick on Christians because most conversations on religion seem to generalize Christians.

1. An average christian has no proof that their is a god, that any part of the bible is true or that any miracles have ever occurred
2. An average christian trusts experts in Christianity to explain Christian issues
3. The average christian knowledge of christianity is not from personal research, but from what they have read or been told by a trusted source

It occurs to me that I blindly follow my scientific beliefs and not christian beliefs only because I trust scientific sources over christian ones. Were I to ask a christian believer, they would have an answer for most of my questions.

I think the highlight of this concept is not that science is religion. It is not. Science relies on proof through evidence (and lets ignore that many believe they can test and prove god-hypothesis).

In the same way a religious person believes in their religion, purely based on the belief in those they trust, we believe in science purely based on the belief in those we trust.

However, we blindly follow science the way that so many people blindly follow theisms.

Did you hear they cured that guy of HIV through a bone marrow transplant? How do you know this is true? You read about it in medical journals, you heard about it on the news, you read that it was peer reviewed. Great, but did you test it. Did you meet this person. Did you personally watch the tests? The only reason you have to believe it is that experts told you about it.

Did you hear about the earthlike planet that was a lot closer than people thought they would find one? Did you find it? Can you see it with your telescope? Why do you believe it without proof.

I've always lived in a devout Christian area, where everyone shoves their beliefs down your throat. For the longest time I just suffered through it. I went to church and tried to get what I could from sermons, even if I didn't agree with it all. I sat in church during hymns, feeling everyone else get that spiritual high - when they're uplifted and feeling hopeful - and all I could feel was a sense of intrusion, because I didn't fit into their community. Not really, anyway.

Then I went through a period of anger. I hated anyone and anything that was remotely Christian. I hated it/them because I could never be part of their group, because I didn't believe the same things as them. I felt left out and alone and really, truly lost. Any time I got the chance, I bashed Christians and arrogantly proclaimed myself an atheist, thinking that *anything* was better than being Christian. Even I didn't understand that frustration and loneliness were at the heart of my actions.

And when the fire to hate other people for being happy finally died away, I felt nothing. I've been in this feeling for a long time - like I was alone in my feelings, that my spiteful atheist phase was something I should be ashamed of, that I was an anomaly in my community - an anomaly in my family. The rest of my family is Christian, though admittedly all different denominations. Yet they all have something in common. Me, I've just gone through my life trying to figure out what I believe. I've been trying to make myself act ethically according to my own standards - and failing miserably. I looked into Buddhism and Taoism, trying to find something I could absolutely agree with, and found nothing.

Then I found this subreddit by accident. I clicked through some of the links, read sermons of Universal Unitarians, and read explanations of what agnostics are... and I could not be more grateful. I'm literally crying and shaking all over right now, because I'm so unsure of what my feelings are doing. I've spent so long feeling lost and alone, and now I find that's not the case. I've been afraid of being spiritual, because I didn't know how.
So I just wanted to thank you for being here, just waiting for me to find you.

The argument, ""If you are willing to believe that their might be a god without proof, then you HAVE to believe in every other mythological thing without proof. So you must admit that their could be unicorns."" They usually say it with a smug smile, like they have caught me in some awesome belief trap. Is there like some sort of ""arguments to use on agnostics manual out there?

The simple answer is actually yes. I do think that their could be unicorns. Or at least that their could have been.

Now, I think its unlikely. I think that unicorns, had they existed, would clearly represent a relative of the horse and probably would exist in fossil record. But hey, maybe we just haven't found one yet.

There was a time when learned intelligent people scoffed at the idea of dinosaurs, of flight, of space flight, of germs, of atoms, of every possible thing that we now know is true. I think to suggest that what we currently have proof of is all that is true shows a folly that is in opposition of the scientific process.

By insisting there is no possibility of such a thing, it closes me off to other possibilities that science will one day prove true, that science will one day prove we believed wrongly today. This is something I can promise you. Right now, you believe something that isn't true. Something that in 50 years, people will say ""Oh my god, can you believed we thought that XYZ was true!"" Who knows, it could even turn out to be something that you currently scoff at someone fore believing. A ""monster"" washing ashore in loch ness, a giant ape found wandering california, alien lizard people secretly living among us, fossil proof of dragons, etc. etc.

So yes, maybe there were horses with horns. Maybe there were fire breathing lizards. Maybe at some point tiny aliens that could fly visited Ireland and played tricks on the stupid inferior race while stealing their babies and created the entire fairy mythos. I don't know.

I chose to take Old and New Testament Survey because it is my philosophy that if you argue against something, you must be informed about it.  In both courses, my professors have been extremely open-minded and view the Bible as a human-made compilation of stories like most legitimate Bible scholars do.  In the first week of class in both cases the lectures were about how the Bible is inconsistent and how it should never be involved in science or politics.  This certainly was not what I was expecting to hear.

 The reason I am posting this is because I have learned a lot in these courses.  I have learned that both Christians and non-Christians have elevated the Bible higher than it should ever have been.  The people who put the Bible together knew that it had inconsistencies because they purposefully put differing perspectives next to each other so that readers could compare and contrast (consider the gospels).  It is only in recent history that people are expecting the Bible to not contradict itself or it isn't valid.  

 Bible writers never cared about accuracy.  All they cared about was getting a point across and they did that through storytelling.

 It saddens me that there is such a stigma associated with the Bible.  Although the courses have not deterred me from my Agnostic viewpoint and there are definitely things that turn me off about the Bible, I have realized that there is also some truly beautiful and insightful literature that is timeless.  The poetry alone seems worth reading.  It seems to me that if the modern day Christians had not made the Bible into some kind of deity, the Bible would be able to be studied as a form of literature in English classes with no negativity, much like we study epic poems or ancient mythologies that are also based on oral tradition. 

 What I am getting at is that people in their ignorance have, in attempting to force the Bible into arenas it has no business being in, effectively deprived the literary world of something that could be wonderful.

I just subscribed to this subreddit and want to say how happy I am that I have found this. I am a Christain, or more specific: I believe in God and since I was raised in a Christian society and baptized (protestant) I accept Christianity as my system of belief. Still I struggle with faith, religion and parts of the Christian doctrine on a regular basis, but I can't shake off my belief in some ""higher power"". It's just a part of me that I've grown to accept. 

 As a relatively new redditor I stumbled upon r/atheism rather quickly and realized: You can't have a serious discussion with most of those people. I can't stand militant atheists as much as I can't stand militant Christians. But now I've found this, and boy am I glad that people on here aren't as entitled and ignorant about other systems of belief than their own.

TL;DR: Christian who sometimes struggles with his own faith, still can't and doesn't want to turn his back on religion. Found r/agnostic after unsubscribing r/atheism.

1361809292.0,35,self.agnostic,1974jp,I'm a gnostic atheist. I've been lurking here and think there is a lot of misconception about what gnostic atheism actually is. I'll describe my views and you guys can feel free to question or antagonize.,Porkfried,53,18,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1974jp/im_a_gnostic_atheist_ive_been_lurking_here_and/,"Before I'll begin, I'll try to explain what I'm talking about to ignostics. I'm referring to anything supernatural, or anything which violates the laws of math or concepts derived from applied math. 

Firstly, I see all knowledge as probability. Many things which I claim to have knowledge about, I recognize could be wrong. I claim to know that the man I think is my father is actually my father. It's possible that he isn't. I claim to know that 8+8 is 16. It's possible that I'm mistaken. I claim to know that the basic laws of addition work in every single ordinary instance without any exception. I haven't tried them all and there could be an exception. I even claim to know where I left my keys, even though I've misplaced them many times.

There's a certain grey area between how probable a believed fact can be before it can be considered knowledge. I think the nonexistence of deities is probable enough to be put into this class of things which can be considered knowledge.

Based upon what I know about the world, my father, and the living habits of elephants. It seems extremely unlikely that there is an elephant living in my dad's house. However, there is absolutely no physical or mathematical law which can prevent there from being an elephant in my dad's house. I even know elephants can exist. However, to say I'm not without some knowledge would be a perversion of the word agnostic. 

Based on what is known about the universe, it seems to me that supernatural entities or deities ought to be placed in the same level of improbability as there being an elephant in my dad's house. Actually I see it as less probable because there's less evidence for the existence of supernatural entities than that there could be an elephant in my dad's house. 

I also don't think my position is faith based as it is often accused of being here. It's derived purely from reason. I don't consider myself to have a horse in the race of whether there is a god or which it might be. It's kind of like how based on what I know about my parents, I think I can know that I don't have a brother. If I am right then whatever, if not then sweet. I feel the same way about pretty much every god ever thought up that I know of.

I think the debate about gnostic atheism vs agnostic atheism vs agnosticism is more of a debate on what constitutes knowledge than on the beliefs or lack thereof themselves.

I'll answer one quick objection before you guys comment:

* But with a potentially infinite amount of unexplored universe and a potentially infinite amount of potential gods or deities, how can you make a claim about all of them?

There are a potentially infinite amount of numbers too. Even without exploring each one of them, we seem to be able to make claims about them. I don't see why gods should be any different.

**tl;dr: It's not that I claim to have any infallible knowledge. I don't make this claim about anything which claim to know. It's just that from what is known about the universe, the probability of the existence of supernatural entities seems below the probability threshold for which I could claim to truly have no knowledge.**

Religion was an attempt to pin down the Divine. The Divine was eternally in flux, forever moving, shifting shape. That was its nature. It was absolute, true enough: absolutely mobile. Absolutely transcendent. Absolutely flexible. Absolutely impersonal. It had its god and goddess aspects, but it was ultimately no more male or female than it was star or screwdriver. It was the sum of all those things, but that sum could never be chalked on a slate. The Divine was beyond description, beyond knowing, beyond comprehension. To say that the Divine was Creation divided by Destruction was as close as one could come to definition. But the puny of soul, the dull of wit, weren't content with that. They wanted to hang a face on the Divine. They went so far as to attribute petty human emotions (anger, jealousy, etc.) to it, not stopping to realize that if God were a being, even a supreme being, our prayers would have bored him to death long ago. 
The Divine was expansive, but religion was reductive. Religion attempted to reduce the Divine to a knowable quantity with which mortals might efficiently deal, to pigeonhole it once and for all so that we never had to reevaluate it.

However, i could never actually call myself an atheist. It probably has something to do with their smugness. Their-possible external-belief that they have it figured out. They know more about 'what' the universe is than the average religious person. Or perhaps like Neil deGrasse Tyson, it's just because most atheists seem to want religion to completely die out and i just don't care.

I recently unsubscribed from /r/atheism because of that. Yet, whenever i see a religious post on FB I want to scream that they're a moron. On the other hand, when i see an atheist post on the internet I want to scream YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE EITHER.

This was before the mass circle jerk really started to into overdrive.

I thought I'd tell my parents that I was an atheist and I didn't believe a word of the Bible or Book of Mormon. This lead to what I call the Great Depression. I thought genuinely that I'd be happy being an atheist as it made a lot more sense to me. Among other things like drinking coffee, watching porn, swearing and not going to church on sunday.

The situation quickly degraded till I was a very angry teenager with some quite upset (and moderate!) parents. I failed to see my parents are just wanting to connect with me. I saw them as despising me as a god-forsaken child.

That changed when I changed from argumentative move to apathy or just not caring about religion. I thought to myself, why should I bother to deal with something that is something personal? I'm obviously not going to persuade anyone in my family which is already concreted in their religion.

And so I decided it would be best to just say ""I don't know, there different opinions on each side, both have good arguments at times. But I am simply agnostic"" I felt like I should just be a good person, a mature person who accepts others opinions but doesn't let that person change my own, and try and repair the damage I caused.

And I seriously almost cry when I see how much it has done wonders  for my family and my happiness. I'm a lot more happy and less stressed because of the no arguments. My family has back off from trying to reconvert me (something that was kinda annoying me) and let me run my course.

Due to that, I felt it couldn't be a bad idea to share my personal feelings and beliefs with the community as a whole, in a way to show that there are many flavors of agnosticism that exist on all ends of the spectrum, and your belief is what you want it to be. Without further ado: 

&gt;Imagine you are in the middle of a vast ocean, just you and the water. That water symbolizes all consciousness in the universe. It just is and was, and I don't have a good reason as to why its there. Now imagine you have in your hands a cup. This cup represents the body. It has everything you could possibly need to call it full, but it's missing that spark of life, it's missing water. Now if you dip that cup into the ocean, you have now filled that vessel with the breath of life, with a soul, with a small piece of the consciousness. Now this body is full and can go about its life. But with life comes death. The cup has served its purpose and it is now time for the soul and the vessel to part ways. Thus the cup is shattered and is gone. But does the water float off into space, never to again join the ocean? No, it instead returns to the ocean from which it was born, to share its own unique experiences with its fellow consciousness.

&gt;To answer your question, reincarnation kind of comes into play. In the above example, if you take another cup and fill it with water, there is the chance that some of the water used before will be in that cup. All consciousness is meant to be used and recycled, used and recycled, all for what I believe to be the great purpose of life. My personal belief is that all life exists to experience life itself. The consciousness is a thing, and like all things it wishes to survive and prosper. The best way to do that is to gain experience and knowledge. That is why it send pieces of itself to gain this experience and knowledge, so that it may thrive, survive, and also enjoy a short existence in our world, the world of the living.

I hope this post gives some of you insight into just how much more agnosticism can be than ""i just don't know."" Hell, maybe it will even give some of you food for thought on the questions you have.

I don't know what I believe.  I'm as ready to be a full believer in any deity if it's existence is proved, as ready as I am to become a full atheist if all deities' existences were disproved.  God doesn't register clearly in my mind.  To me, God might as easily be a man up in the clouds as he is an extension of the entire universe, manifesting itself in every thing.  I just don't know.  This goes for any of the major three monotheistic faiths.  I was never a believer in polytheism, but I feel that there is as much possibility for Apollo and Zeus as there is for the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic God.  Sure, greek mythology seems silly in essence, but I just can't 100% disprove anything in the universe.  For all I know, a giant sky lizard could be ruling us the entire time.  As unlikely as it seems to me, I still cannot prove it does not exist.  But regarding the popular concept of ""God""...I just can't simply say I believe or not.  That atheist quip ""Reducto Ad Absurdum"" is too narrow-minded for me...it would seem absurd 6000 years ago that everything is created by these tiny particles called atoms.  The same thing goes for God...I just can't say ""Oh, hell yea he exists"" or ""God?  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of""

So, I just had this thought floating in my head last night as I was falling asleep and wanted to share it with fellow agnostics to see what they might think of it.

In my particular belief, I think conscious beings are pretty special, and that despite not knowing anything about what happens ""after"", I think at the least that something ""pretty cool"" happens ""after"".

My thought:

What if our brains are like our personal computers? It's a hard drive, and has just enough information to keep the body running, but only enough space to have some vital programs, critical thinking, talents, etc... We're not all exactly psychic or telepathic because our HD capacity is limited, or we just don't have enough RAM and we're waiting for the upgrade in a couple more centuries.

What if our pineal gland is like the wireless network card that's constantly (and passively) connecting to the ""cloud"" of the universe (maybe where past-life memories, experiences, or talents are stored - IF you're into that way of thought like Akashic records . . .). The whole point is to accumulate all experiences on Earth - bad or good. 

I guess it's another way of saying, ""This is how the universe comes to know itself"" sort of philosophy.

Hi r/agnostic!

I am a panentheistic Catholic and ex-agnostic, and I fully respect the agnostic position. I enjoy this subreddit as it seems to be full of people who are searching for answers rather than people who have come to conclusions, and I think that's the right approach.

I hope for polite discussion, comments, and critiques of the argument I present. I do not expect to change anyone's mind, I only hope that my reasoning is novel for some of the members here, and that maybe I can offer a different perspective. 

Anyways,

**What follows is my latest iteration of my argument for the belief in God. It is not a proof of the existence of God. This cannot be proven. It is however proof that if one accepts a certain premises then one has a belief in God, whether they are cognizant of that belief or not. I will do my best to be as clear and as brief is I can.**

**Operational Definitions**

*Objective/objectivity*: existing independently of verification; existing independently of any subject: existing necessarily.

*Consciousness*: awareness

*Subject/subjectivity*: dependent upon another for existence; dependent upon verification; contingent.

*Experience*: having a subjective perception of...

*Perception*: an object of consciousness

*God*: an objective consciousness

*Reality*: the physical universe as understood by science, including any possible multiverses.

**Argument**

&gt;1. If and only if (IFF) an objective consciousness (God) exists, then we experience an objective reality.

&gt;2. We experience an objective reality

&gt;3. Therefore, God exists.

This is undeniably a valid deduction. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

The argument can be refuted by refuting either of the premises (1 or 2). Premise 2 (we experience an objective reality), I concede cannot be proven. However, I contend, it is illogical and irrational to deny 2. To deny 2 is to deny science. A denial of 2 is a commitment to solipsism.

This leaves us in a position where, if we believe that 2 is true (if we believe we experience an objective reality) the only way to refute the argument is to refute 1.

To refute 1 we would need to prove that the existence of an objective consciousness (God) is either a) unnecessary (only if) or b) insufficient (if) for us to experience an objective reality.

However, unlike 2, 1 can be logically proven. What follows is the proof of 1.

&gt;1. We only directly experience (A)consciousness; all experience of (B) reality is within our experience of consciousness. *(theory of mind; indirect realism, the most widely accepted theory of how we experience the external world among scientists and philosophers).*

&gt;2. A cannot prove the truth (objectivity) of B unless the objectivity of A has been established. *(Descartes, meditations of first philosophy. I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am, and by the objectivity of my being I can prove that my experiences are real. Without establishing that I exsist I am unable to prove the existence of my subjective experiences)*

&gt;3. Therefore, consciousness cannot prove the objectivity of reality unless the objectivity of consciousness is established. *(from 1 and 2)*

&gt;4. Consciousness cannot prove the objectivity of itself (circularity) though neither can the objectivity of consciousness be doubted. *(Descartes)*

&gt;5. That which is not susceptible to rigorous proof can only be believed. *(definition belief)*

&gt;6. That which cannot be doubted must be believed *(definition self-evidence)*

&gt;7. Therefore, the objectivity of consciousness can only be, and must be, believed, but it cannot be proven. *(from 4, 5, 6)*

&gt;8. Therefore, the experience of an objectivity of reality can ONLY be proven through a belief in the objectivity of consciousness, which must be believed but cannot be proven. *(from 1, 3, 7). (this proves that the necessary condition is met. Only if there exists an objective consciousness do we experience an objective reality; one MUST assume the existence of an objective consciousness to believe we experience an objective reality, regardless of whether we are cognizant of the fact we are making this assumption)*

&gt;9. If there is an objective consciousness, than the objectivity of what is experienced within consciousness can be proven *(identity theory of truth) (this fulfills the sufficient condition)*

&gt;10. (1 in the original argument). Therefore, **If and only if (IFF) an objective consciousness (God) exists, then we experience an objective reality.** *(from 8, 9)*

&gt;QED

So this is, I believe, a sound argument and a rational justification for belief in God. 1 is logically proven, I think. it is irrational to assume that I am the objective consciousness (that I am God) because I cannot manifest reality with ""my"" consciousness (it isnt mine I only experience it directly), and it is illogical to think solipsism is true because all evidence suggests that reality is objective and other minds exist. This leaves us in the position of accepting the existence of a transcendent and objective consciousness which manifests and sustains the reality we experience, i.e. God, if we accept that we experience an objective reality. 

I am kind of hoping for just some respectful comments and critiques of my argument, and friendly theological discussion in general.

Cheers. 

*I will be constantly proofreading and correcting any grammatical or substantive errors I find, I'm sure there are at least a few of the former, I hope there are less of the latter.*

I reject the concept of gods and no-gods equally believing that we don't have enough evidence to know either way. Though, I typically lean away from the mystical and believe our world is explainable by science.

I also believe that most things that seem impossible are probably just made up fantasies and stories (though hold the possibility that they may be true or based on something true). I think its incredibly unlikely that their are or ever where unicorns, pixies or zombies. I hold out that their could have been sure, but find it very unlikely.

Honestly, rationally speaking I really doubt there is any form of god force out there.

But irrationally, I feel watched over and guided. Like some force beyond our knowledge is directly effecting my life. Too many weird coincidences and too many weird experiences.

There are the small things like when you think ""I should Call XY"" and as you pick up the phone they are calling you. Or the big ones like when you have that awful feeling, slam on the breaks and watch a tree fall right where your car would have been. Or that time you were walking past a restaurant, decide on a whim to stop in for a bite to eat and run into someone you haven't seen or spoken to in over a decade and had just the day before been asking yourself ""I wonder whatever happened to him.""

Rationally I know that they are just coincidences. Rationally I know that the weird experiences have perfectly rationally explanations. Rationally I can even postulate that if there was a ""god"" there is no reason that my life would be focused on to be guided.

But damn its hard to shake that irrational part of the brain.

I can't be the only one.

I went to visit my great-grandmother last week, who's 88 years old. We talked a lot about my grandfather (her son) and my father (her grandson), and how they seem to have gone overboard with their religions recently. My grandfather was never religious until his wife died almost 10 years ago and remarried; since then he has started attending a traditional Methodist church (we live in the South) and has become very resentful and judgmental of our other family members who do not share in his religious beliefs. My father wasn't religious either until he remarried my step-mother about 4 years ago, then he became a hardcore Christian fundie like she is. He went from listening to heavy rock and roll and fishing and hunting at every opportunity to being at church 3 or 4 times a week and refusing to listen to or read anything that doesn't support his religion.

My great-grandmother and I have very similar religious views. We don't think you need religion to be a good person or have morals, and that takes priority over any religious beliefs. We both are uncertain about whether a god exists or whether there is an afterlife, although we choose to believe in such despite any supporting evidence because it makes us feel more comfortable about death and life in general. We also believe that although everyone is entitled to their opinion and their beliefs, those beliefs should be kept private and shouldn't be shared or forced upon anyone.

Has anyone else noticed this kind of pattern in their family? Each generation is about 20 years apart, give or take a few. 

I'm not trying to be critical of my father or grandfather; although I don't agree with them, they are entitled to believe whatever they want, no matter how ridiculous I think it is.",,False,,t5_2qjrd,False,,,True,t3_vc19i,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/vc19i/does_anyone_else_notice_a_generational_gap_in/,

One thing led to an other. I started researching on Lutheran faith and Calvinistic faith. Something felt wrong there. Then I researched on where the concept of original sin came from and how it grew until Calvin progressing towards the reformation.

Then I came to the understanding that Calvin and Luther both belonged to the medieval ages and they were heavily influenced by the idea of three estates: the clergy, the aristocrats and the serfs. That explained why they appoint men over others to be held accountable to in Churches.

Meanwhile, I also read about the inconsistencies in the gospel. I started investigating and came to the conclusion that gospels are written by various people from different sources and given the inconsistencies, the first thing to go out of my mind was the “inerrant” view of Bible. I’m not the one who believes in young earth and all these things, but still I cannot hold it together considering the fact that the Bible contradicts itself so much.

Then I came across Paul’s version of Christianity, and how he was not accepted by the Jerusalem Church whose head was James the Just who was appointed by Jesus as the head of the Church prior to crucifixion. Paul preached his own version of the gospel which also contradicts the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus himself.

With all of these inconsistencies in place, it is really difficult to place my faith on Christianity. I still believe in God and He will be able to save us.

I’m not religious. I read the Psalms at times. But there is overwhelming evidence against the New Testament and Christianity. I believe in God and that is all. God has given us rights, individuality and have asked us to take responsibility. I will take that.

I want to quickly lay out something to think about, and just give you some interesting things to think about.

Firstly, I know many many people love to use the ""Theist, Agnostic Thiest, Agnostic Athiest, Athiest"" model, and say that ""oh really, agnosticism doesn't exist, you either have a god or not, doesn't matter how much you believe in them"" and boiling athiesm down to simply believing in a god or not. Obviously yes, using that model that is correct, but that doesn't mean that the model is the right way to think about things.

No matter how factually accurate that is, that completely undermines the importance of being in a state of not-knowing whether there is a god/supreme being/flying space jelly, or whether there isn't. I think it's important to note that everyone has their own coded way of looking at this topic, but that each persons does not scan very well to the next.

I view agnosticism as largely, not knowing or being convinced by either party. In my view it is difficult to be either agnostic atheist or agnostic theist because I feel like that even the predisposition for god/no god is to claim to have more knowledge than is actually available, but to others this is totally incompatible and that makes perfect sense.

I claim agnosticism not because of lack of judgement or conviction, but the opposite. It takes great conviction and balance to be able to look at all the different data around us and say ""I don't know. I don't even understand the architecture of this"" this is how I feel and I believe strongly that this will never change, no facts or fables will ever be able to fully convince.

So that is why I am agnostic, and that is why I think that the best answer to ""what is agnosticism"" is that it is simply the lack of knowledge to be able to make a decision. However this should never be demeaned or taken lightly, to dismiss that not-knowing is ridiculous is to dismiss a huge part of human nature and the desire to learn more about our lives and surroundings. So next time someone says ""oh you have to be either agnostic theist or atheist"" don't engage them. Just let them know that you value the state of not-knowing and searching for knowledge, just as highly as they value their state of 'confirmed' knowledge.

Hope that gives y'all something to think about.

Keep in mind that this is my OPINION and philosophy.

The brain is such a complex thing, but we barely know anything about it. Despite all the research done over the course of history, we are not able to look at a living brain, and study it; we can only study the brain when some one is deceased. So I thought about this long and hard and  came up with a philosophy that many people may either agree or disagree with. So during life, we come to believe in God(s) just for the pure fact that we need a sense of security, like when you die that there will be ""paradise"" or something like that. Like it or not, this is a clear fact because we do not surely know of any higher being. But to me, when someone dies, their brain's last final function may be compiling what the person has believed during their life religious wise, and creates a kind of ""personal heaven"". Like if a Christian dies, and they've believed their whole life that ""heaven"" is in the clouds and you will see all of you dead loved ones, and angels sing, etc. Then their Brain, creates that specific heaven in their mind, and the person is forever in that world. Think of it as a huge simulation the brain is putting on. Another example, is if an Agnostic (such as myself) believes in basically anything, well the possibilities are endless! Its pretty much what ever the brain puts together. I know that many people will disagree, and some people may even agree with me.

Wall of text incoming!

I'm a 19 year old female who used to be a Baptist. I didn't start attending until my freshman year of high school, when my friend invited me to youth group. After that initial meeting, I felt a sense of belonging I hadn't felt elsewhere. As a girl with depression and anxiety who was shy at school and didn't have many friends, this was a big deal for me, and I started going to youth group every week. My pastor was awesome, my friends there were welcoming, and I was becoming more confident in myself.

Towards the middle of my freshman year, I started dating one of the guys from youth group. He was my first boyfriend so I had no idea how to deal with guys and just kind of went with it. I was pretty submissive, which I owe both to my anxiety and the overwhelming push in the bible for women to be submissive to men. Bad combo: this kid started mentally abusing me, calling me fat and ugly, and at one point stopped hugging me because of a verse in the bible his neighbor told him about that says, ""It is good for a man not to touch a woman"" (I believe it's in Corinthians somewhere). Of course I was hurt, but I thought it was normal (I was very naive) and then one day he dumped me out of (what I thought) the blue. He continued to send me menacing messages on facebook, though, causing my depression to worsen and eventually my dad got involved. He never bothered me again after that, and stopped going to that youth group. This should have been my first clue that maybe joining a church wasn't the best idea.

Fast forward to the end of my freshman year. My dad was arrested, on charges I would rather not share with random people on the internet. But it was bad, and obviously caused a lot of stress for our family. I was going to church more than ever, searching for answers, trying to work through my depression, and now to try and find forgiveness for my dad (which I did--we've always been best friends and although it was hard at first, I love him to death). 

Because my parents saw how much I depended on the church, and were seeing positive results in my outlook on life and my confidence, they started going to church with me. My brother started going to youth group (which he stopped after a few months because of school) and I got some of my friends from school to join.

The first thing that started to get me thinking that maybe church wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be was during one youth group where the topic of homosexuality was being discussed. Thankfully I’m WAYYYYY more open minded now, but at the time I was unsure of how I felt about homosexuality—mainly because I was going to church where they taught that it was wrong, but my sister also identified herself as bisexual and I had several gay friends at school. Unfortunately, two of those friends were at youth group that night, where my pastor basically bashed the gay community, called them sinners, and told us that it was our duty to pray for them to not be gay. Obviously, my two friends didn’t come back to youth group.

Some of you may think that that experience should have been enough for me to leave, but as I said I was naïve and, I’m pretty sure, almost brainwashed at this point. But I was happy, and my parents were happy, and I thought church was a good thing. And then the three of us decided to become members.

Before I go into this, aside from the night at youth group I just mentioned, I had never had any experience with any of the church members being judgmental of anyone. We all felt welcome in the church; otherwise we wouldn’t have decided to go through with membership.

Anyway, after a month of learning about the church’s history, their basic core beliefs, etc. it was time for us to become members in front of the Sunday morning service. However, a week before it was supposed to happen, the deacons pulled the three of us aside because they didn’t think it would be good for church politics if my dad became a member because of the shit he was going through with his trial. It had been three years since everything had happened at this point, and he had been attending church for almost two. We all thought, of all places, the church would be most forgiving. Apparently not.

After that we stopped going to church. I could no longer believe in a god whose followers treated their fellow human beings like the church had treated my family. There was obviously a lot of unhappiness in the hearts of these people who said that they were always filled with happiness, these people who preached forgiveness and equality but who did not practice it. 

Since then, my parents have both joined new churches; my mom joined a flock group across town and my dad joined one, unfortunately, in prison. I couldn’t bring myself to go back. I have, however, started becoming more spiritual lately. I want to believe there is something out there, whether it be a higher being or just nature in and of itself. I want to believe that someday I’ll find true happiness within myself and within the world.

TL;DR: Started going to church in high school, found a place I belonged. Convinced other people to join that all ended terribly. Now I’m no longer a Christian but might consider myself agnostic.

Growing through my teen years, I began to question everything, from things as simple as every day things I hear from people, to government, to religion... I began researching politics and government, mythology and religion, science, music, and many other fields.

Upon researching mythology, I came across a few things that REALLY made me doubt my faith in my religion. I found that the story of Jesus is VERY similar to that of Horus in ancient Egyptian myths. I found that the flood story of Moses is also found in other mythologies like Babylonian and Hindu. I found so many similarities to the bible in so many other religions that pre-date the bible that the bible could no longer convince me.

Upon researching religion, including my former religion, Mormonism, I found some convincing and doubtless holes and stories that just made me say, ""This religion can not be true..."" You know, even the church leaders say not to look up anti-mormon doctrine. Being naturally suspicious, I began thinking, ""That's probably because they're afraid we'll discover it is impossible and untrue.""

Science has always made so much sense to me. Sure, it isn't perfect, but it makes sense. The theory of evolution, the creation of planets and stars. It all just made so much more sense than an invisible man taking some dirt and making a man, then taking his rib and making a woman, and light suddenly appearing cause he said for it to appear, and simply making the earth in 7 days. Satan also doesn't make sense. Chemicals in the brain determine our emotion, our thought, our everything. There is no man whispering in our ear to do evil. Same with the holy spirit.

So I have determined, all religion really is and ever has been is a way to explain the unexplainable, to give hope of an afterlife, and to teach people to behave. And don't get me wrong - I respect religion. It brings people happiness and joy. But I have also seen the dark side of it, as we all have.

But I can't tell my parents this. They would be shocked. Truth is, I could never tell them. It would break their hearts. I know they'd still love me and would never resent me, but I could never bear to put them through that pain. My parents and the church have been putting pressure on me to go, but obviously, I don't want to do something for a cause I don't believe in. I would rather move on with my own life.

Perhaps God is something that exists in conceptual form (and can be practically applied to real life), but is never quite realized in reality (like a mathematically perfect circle, for example.)  Yet, many people treat it as if it must be yes or no -- and I suspect this is related to the way our language works.

Or to approach it in a rather different way, can ""God"" be an action, rather than a person or thing?  Our language treats ""God"" as a noun, and generally assumes that a noun ""does"" a verb.

I was raised Christian and it was put forth in a manner that was so matter of fact that it made me feel like I started life off with all the right answers. Before you say all Christianity does that, this subdenomination (United Reformed) is the extremely right winged side (as opposed to Christian Reformed, or other Reformed denominations). I went to sunday school my whole life, Christian school my whole life. We didn't learn *about* different denominations or religions, we learned about how to refute them. I'm not here to rail on Christians, my point is that it left me with having 'all the right answers' as my sense of duty. As I went off to college (Christian Reformed) new ideas were presented to me, and their cases made sense with my knowledge at the time. It was shocking to me that people with different ideas could present them in a way that actually made sense, and that every 'fact' I had previously learned could be potentially incorrect.

Fast forward some odd years and I was obsessed with finding all the right answers. I would go to parties and be the guy who was like so what do we think of (insert theological point here). I was obsessed with questioning and getting opinions, playing devil's advocate and all that business. Every time I thought I had made some sort of breakthrough I kept in mind that there was no way of knowing if I really was right or not.

This is around the time I became agnostic. It was in my opinion the best conclusion I ever came to. I was finally comfortable with NOT knowing.

My nihilistic tendencies have gotten to the point of impairing my life. I 'know I should' do things to move forward in life, but I don't care enough to do it.

If I still feel time then no amount of movies could keep me entertained for eternity.

It looks convenient as a math equation; it's easy to see a number going on forever.  .3 repeating for example, or just counting up forever.  see?  it's infinite!  but in a practical sense I cannot come to grips with it.  there is nothing that goes on forever, right?
but that is not the case.  there exists that which has no end.  and it is out there in real life right now.  for us to observe even!  and that is overwhelming.

for whatever reason though, that does not overwhelm me.  counting up numbers doesn't lead me to poinder the mysteries about the epically mysterious number 4657 quadrillion.  that has no inrigue to me.  but here are a couple things that are infinite that do have intrigue to me:  time and space.  I won't cover my thoughts on space because this is the agnostic section of the infinite of space has nothing to do with how I became such.  but I will touch on how time made my mind goopy.

when did time begin? we all know that time is concept that we thought of to measure sequences of events. but would you consider that we 'invented' time? or did we 'discover' time?
well the way i see it, time existed before we could label it as such. can paleantologists approximate how long the dinosaurs lived? yes. therefore time existed before we could name it time. and therefore time was discovered, not invented.
so does time have a beginning? well we can't say that time began when we invented it now can we? so you try to think back back back before dinosaurs, before continents and pangea. before earth was created and the solar system was being born. this is all happening through time. its not fair to measure time in years when you think about the grande scheme of the cosmic universe. not when an 'eon' is but a mere blink of an eye. or less. ...infinitely less =O

that's the rub. how far back do we go before we find the beginning of time? the big bang? well ok.. but did time exist before that? yes. for how long was the big bang there for? what was there before the big bang? emptiness? for how long was there emptiness? you see where i'm going here? time is infinite! and since time is infinite that means it exists in both directly infinitely. forward through time infinitely (which is where we are right now) and backwards through time infinitely.
now i'm going to go out on a limb here and theorize that before our big bang, there was another universe. scientists have already observed that our universe is comprised of galaxies that are moving away from a single point. yes that's right. you heard me. entire galaxies are moving out from a center point. in fact that's what helped this big bang theory in the first place.
so in order for there to be a big bang, it was the universe contracting in on itself to form that ginormous ball of mass.
so getting back to time, if you were to go back in time before the big bang, you would get to see another universe. back up further, another big bang. one before that?
actually, which big bang are we in? are we the 4th big bang? the 397th? the 18 trillionth? its all guesswork there of course. since time is infinite going backwards, its possible there are infinite big bangs. whaaaaat...

in fact, since time is infinite, you could go back to the very first big bang.  and you can see what was before it.  did god make it?  who is this god?  when did he appear into existence?  we can travel infinitely back in time to when god began.  and what was before that?  and before that.  and before that.  and before that... infinitely....

this is part of what makes me agnostic.  I am aware that I have no fucking clue what is out there and I am open to the possibility of anything.

Theists more often then not did the whole ""Well just don't give up just yet!"" since not being atheist somehow meant I was ""closer to being saved.""

This got me thinking about a lot of things, mainly where was it really going.  My reason for thinking this was obvious, we still had poor, and hungry in our town.  I know we have a food bank in our town, but it is run from donations of food and money from local businesses and groups like the rotary and the lions clubs to name a couple.  We even have one man who does a huge campaign by himself every fall and gets thousands in donations, and tons of food donated to the food bank.  So where did the collection plate go to?

I stopped going to church around this time.  My whole family did for some reason.

I remember in my later teen years I was asked to go to a youth night with some friends.  I told them I would as long as it was not religious.  They promised me it was just some youth getting together, board games, darts etc.  When I showed up it was a catholic sermon.  It was the story of King Solomon and how he gave up his wealth to help the people of his kingdom.  The preacher then asks me infront of the entire room ""We have a new person here tonight, what do you think think of the tale of King Solomon?"" I replied ""it is a good tale, too bad it is not practiced today.""  The preacher asked me what I meant, I could only say this ""When I got here tonight I seen several large 4x4 trucks, not used for work, I seen several top end town cars and sports cars.  I seen many new cars (within 5 years old), Brands like Cadillac and Lincoln were seen, yet none of the drivers had given up their expensive rides to get money to donate to the poor, to help them get a roof over their heads, feed themselves, afford post secondary education.

So for the last year, I've been questioning my Christian beliefs and I found that it just doesn't really all add up (my process that lead to that conclusion is long and I won't explain it here) and labeled myself as an agnostic. Yet, I do believe in the afterlife for one, and only one anecdotal reason. I know that anecdotal evidence isn't very convincing, but what I'm about to share with you just gives me such mixed feelings and makes me think there is indeed a God or at least an afterlife. I swear to God (I mean err) and promise that the following did take place and I am not just some guy scamming and trolling you all into believing this. 

So anyways, one day I was at home and decided that I would fill up my gas tank because I had a coupon that expired that day. So I left the house, and drove to the nearest station about two miles away. On the way there, I was adjusting the FM radio transmitter on my iPod (stupid to multitask and drive, I know) as I was headed to a roundabout. I guess I judged poorly how close I was to the roundabout because when I looked up from adjusting the transmitter, I was about to slam into the roundabout curb at about fifteen MPH. I remember thinking ""oh shit"" before I was about to hit it  and before I knew it, I had steered clear of the curb and was driving fine. I had avoided the the roundabout and saved costly damage to my cars steering rack. I didn't think this was any type of miracle nor did I praise the heavens, I  just thought good reflexes and a little bit of dumb luck saved me. So I filled up my tank, and went back home without thinking anything of it. 

Upon arriving home, I rang the doorbell and my mom answered the door . She looked at me strangely and asked ""Did you almost hit a roundabout?!"" I was stunned to say the least when she asked this because there was no way my mom could've known this unless she saw this happen. Yet, I cooly answered, ""Uhhh no Mom, I can drive, I don't run into inanimate objects."" My mom then said, ""Oh huh, cause when I was napping I had a dream where my mom (so my grandmother, who is deceased) told me to tell you to never ever do that again and she saved you from the curb."" When I heard this I went numb and I automatically confessed the truth to my mom how I wasn't paying attention to the road and almost indeed slam into the roundabout. 

I was very shocked to hear that my grandma had supposedly helped me from the grave. I asked my mom if she made that story up, and she denied it. Besides, my mom isn't the type to lie about something like that. I thought of all of the rational possibilities for this strange puzzle and could only think of a few: 1) the dream was a total and random coincidence and had nothing to do with my grandma. 2) Someone saw that I was gonna crash and called my mom and told her, and my mom just bullshitted some story to scare me. 3) My grandma did indeed help me out, and she intervened from the afterlife. 

To let you guys know, my grandma was a very very devote Christian. Her life was dedicated around the religion. 

Anyways, I just wanted to share that story with you guys to let you know that I want to label myself as an agnostic, but that my experiences tell me there is an afterlife. If any of you have hypothesis to explaining this event I would honestly love to hear it. I promise that everything I typed here is true. I have questioned my mom several times since this event happened and she still insists that my grandma (in a dream) told my mom she had saved me. I understand if you are skeptical, as I am too of this but I just wanted to share this story with you guys and especially want to hear what you think.

Just today I....really came to terms with being an agnostic, and I realize now..that it's something that I've known for quite a long time. I remember distinctly hearing a theory that ""the reason we can't see or sense god is because he's so powerful.""

1342317406.0,19,self.agnostic,wkpgq,Why I reject the common agnostic chart and my proposed solution of a better system,GGTeMpLaR,29,10,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/wkpgq/why_i_reject_the_common_agnostic_chart_and_my/,"A few years ago I remember adamantly arguing that agnosticism was actually compatible with atheism or theism on many occasions. As of recent though, I've come to question this with almost everyone educated in the argument willing to concede that they are actually just an ""agnostic theist"" or ""agnostic atheist"". If everybody is just agnostic, what's the point of having it as a term at all? I've never met anyone familiar with the terms and the chart staunchly defend gnosticism of either kind with a well-reasoned argument. There has to be a better way to distinguish these three terms, right?

I've come up with an extremely simple and clear alternative that relies on two simple statements and their logical negations (based on Universal and Existential quantifiers and their negations in Symbolic Logic). The new system I propose is in stark contrast with the currently accepted chart of ""http://i.imgur.com/s2m7D.png"", which I believe to be extremely vague and useless, despite having loved the idea behind it for several years.


The new system is comprised of an argument of four simple statements as seen below:

(1)Statement: It is the case that I believe God exists.
(2)Negation: It is not the case that I believe God exists.

(3)Statement: It is the case that I believe God does not exist.
(4)Negation: It is not the case that I believe God does not exist.


I will argue that Theism, Agnosticism, and Atheism are clearly defined and incompatible in the given definitions below:


Theism: Holds statements 1 and 4 to be true.
(1)It is the case that I believe God exists.
(4)It not the case that I believe God does not exist.

Agnosticism: Holds statements 2 and 4 to be true.
(2)It is not the case that I believe God exists.
(4)It is not the case that I believe God does not exist.

Atheism: Holds statements 3 and 2 to be true.
(3)It is the case that I believe God does not exist.
(2)It is not the case that I believe God exists.

A simple and messy chart I have made will make it easier to see:
http://i.imgur.com/6Wixe.jpg


TL;DR ~~~~~ IMPORTANT~~~~~
The chart and entire definition system is based on three assumptions. I believe unless you disprove one of these assumptions, the new systems proves to be extremely clear, simple, and will prevent numerous debates of semantics that arise from the alternative graph.

i) If one argues statement (3) to be true, it logically follows that they must also argue statement (2) to be true. (Atheist)

ii) If one argues statement (1) to be true, it logically follows that they must also argue statement (4) to be true. (Theist)

iii.) If one argues neither statements (1) or (3) are true, it logically follows that they must also argue statements (2) and (4) to be true.


Again, there are only three categories in the new chart I propose that are simple and clearly defined through valid deductive reasoning. Please give constructive criticism and any feedback, especially if you think you don't actually fit into one of these three categories which I believe to be impossible right now unless I've overlooked something.
The messy new chart again at the bottom just because it's a lot easier to follow in this order than the statement/negation order above in text:

I spent my entire young life in the church and as a devout christian. I abandoned my faith in a period of about one year and felt free. I began to feel better about myself but worse about my faith. I began hating god more and more for what he had done to the world, with terrorism as a result of religion and also for what he'd done to me. I'd turned into a huge pretentious teenager and hated it.

I've been thinking.  Once someone has provided sufficiently concrete evidence to substantiate a belief it's very hard to refute it unless contrary evidence is later found.  However, if a belief completely lacks hard evidence, one can always say that it's still a possibility because we lack the knowledge and reason to make any true judgement.

I was born and raised as a catholic in a very religious family. I was brought up to believe in very religious values and to follow the bible. I only recently joined a youth group at my church and we had a retreat sort of thing called catholic heart work camp. It was mostly a volunteer opportunity. It sounded fun and I thought I might grow in my faith from it. 

We took a 4 hour trip to the location. We were bunked in rooms in a catholic school that was on summer break. And had some free time before the afternoon mass. A buddy of mine and I started to talk and the topic lead to religion. Now we both had been sort of questioning what our beliefs were and we connected deeply on the subject.

We brought up how we thought the church was a little hypocritical with some of its values. One thing that we both didn't agree with the church on most deeply was the topic of homosexuality. God loves everyone right? That's what the church says, but homosexuals are sinners and are going to hell. This distraught us. It seemed like a hypocritical statement that even most people around us had been forced to believe. I personally have no problem with homosexuals they are no different than anyone else except that they like people of the same gender, they don't deserve to go to hell they deserved to be loved by everyone and not discriminated by the church. 

Throughout the weeklong camp my friend and I further questioned our beliefs. One day the camp had a ""religious deepening experience"" planned for us. What this was was an amount if time set aside where we could reflect on our faith and talk to the priest and other patrons and what- not. My friend decided to talk to the priest about what he and I had been thinking throughout the trip. The priest was unable to answer questions about what we didn't like about Catholicism and tried to get my friend to not talk to anyone about what he was thinking about. He also told my friend to never draw anyone else away from the catholic faith. My friend was very distraught, the priest had made it would lie a cult or something and we weren't aloud to think about other religions or question our faith at all. My friend told me of his experience and we both agreed that we had had it with Catholicism. Later we accepted the fact that we have no way of knowing who or what if anything of a greater power is out there.

This experience was life changing to me. I finally felt right about what I believe and In my personal faith and I made one of the best friends I had ever had who happens to think nearly the same way I do about the subject. 

TL:DR I was born and raised catholic. Went to a religious camp.

God exists, in one form or another. Whatever force/being created the universe we live in is our god. Whether we are just an accidental byproduct of some superior race's videogame or are purposefully constructed reproducing matter, whatever made our universe is god.

That god might be an all powerful all seeing god who is scrutinizing our every move to see whether we deserve an afterlife, or god might merely a law of physics which doesn't allow ""nothing"" to exist.

Maybe our universe isn't inside a computer, but actually is a computer.. Maybe we are the deadly AI which became self aware, maybe we are infecting the system, maybe WE will be the ""virus"" which takes over and enslaves our makers.

Our god might have the power to change the course of our universe, or he might be an observer. He might not know we exist, he might have even created life elsewhere and is observing them but not us.

Pretty much met with a friend who I had lost contact with.  Turns out he's an atheist.  Didn't think that would hinder anything.

Started out at lunch, cue boring story.  Anyway, cut to when he says ""So...I heard you're an agnostic.  Why?""  Me, currently swallowing a mouthful of bread and peanut butter, was caught off guard by this question, as my religious (do YOU count agnosticism as a religion?  I do) beliefs tend not to come up in conversations.  I gave him the common answer, saying that there's not enough evidence on either side to believe in the existence of a deity or not.  He claims that since there is no (cue the magic word) **rational** proof of a god, the default belief should be disbelief.

Now, this used to be my mindset before I accepted that I just didn't fucking know.  There's no proof that one exists, so he doesn't.  That's when I manned up (mind you, this guy is very large and intimidating) and said ""Well do you have any proof for there **NOT** being one?""

He pretty much blew his shit and started going off in the middle of the sandwich shop, saying that you don't need proof to count down something ridiculous and unbelievable, to which I replied ""Well, if this 'silly' and 'unbelievable' religion is so absurd, then how do you explain the millennia of belief by people?  I'm not saying God exists or not, but even people from 2000 years ago had brains.  And the bible isn't known for being completely morally sound, but it says that Israelites struggled with their faith, and their god showed wonders to rekindle their belief (paraphrasing.  Some were harsh).  I'm not citing that as proof either.  But something kept these people believing, whether it was real or imagination.  The only thing is...you and I both know that we don't know which it is.  So you can't claim you know there isn't a god, just like a theist can't claim that they know there is a god.""

At this he pretty much just ate the rest of his lunch in silence and paid for the bill himself.  Blah blah blah.

I've had this question for a long time and feel like this is a good place to find an answer. Sorry if I sound offensive at any point; I'm not trying to offend, but just explain my thoughts and find an answer to a question that has been on my mind for a while.

""Agnosticism is the view that the truth values of certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any deity, as well as other religious and metaphysical claims—are unknown"" (definition from Wikipedia)

Does anyone really think they can know, with certainty, that God exists or does not exist? Surely it's possible that there is a supreme being who simply enjoys tricking us into doubting his existence; likewise, it's clearly possible that religious texts are works of fiction, and perceived miracles will eventually be explained by science No one reasonable would assign certainty to the truth value of god.

Theism and Atheism not only can coincide with agnosticism, but they are defined to coincide with agnosticism. Wikipedia defines theism as ""the belief that at least one deity exists,"" while atheism is the rejection of such belief. But ""belief"" is a word that implies the lack of absolute certainty. Theists and atheists, by definition, do not claim to be certain of their beliefs. By definition, both theists and atheists are agnostics.

To me, it seems like saying you're an agnostic is like saying you're not outrageously disillusioned. It does not define you or illustrate who you are as a person. It is just an assumed detail that you feel the need to remind us of. How does being an agnostic separate you from all the other humans. What does it mean to be an agnostic?

For example, I think that the existence of a god, as portrayed by any of the major religions, is unlikely. I do not claim to know that there is no god, but I think that god mostly likely does not exist. It's certainly possible that god exists, but with the current evidence I have, I think that he probably does not. How would I define myself? Am I an atheist, agnostic, or agnostic atheist? If I am an agnostic or agnostic atheist, what would it mean to be an atheist? Likewise, if I am an atheist, what would it mean to be an agnostic or an agnostic atheist?

Anyone else? Do you still practice your old holiday traditions (if you had any)?** 

I was brought up in a very poor Christian household (American). I've identified as Agnostic for close to ten years now, and I always feel guilty about how much I enjoy celebrating the holidays. I go with my Mom to a ""sing along"" performance of the Messiah (2 hours of Frisson, it's incredible). I give as many gifts as I can afford. My very Christian extended family joins us (my mom's a deist and I'm agnostic) for a Christmas Eve party, and we drink too much. My traditions and the December atmosphere have always made me very happy, but lately they're making me feel like some kind of impostor by enjoying the traditions of a group I don't belong to anymore. 

I love *A Muppet Christmas Carol* because while the setting is Christmas Eve, the story itself isn't propelled by religion, just the ideas of generosity, compassion, and redemption. Anyways, the Marley and Marley song and the Cratchit scenes just really upset me this time around. Christmastime highlights all the qualities, values, and virtues I hold dear and makes me remember that I learned those things in a religious context. I know they are important ideals outside of religion, but it does make me nostalgic for my childhood faith. 

**What are your experiences, thoughts, and opinions?**

A note of explanation: yes it's early. My mom doesn't have much free time, and Christmas is one of her favorite holidays. She loves to decorate, have a Christmas tree, and enjoy all the noms of the season, but because she works and has this insane commute, she won't get to do these things this year. So I put up the tree, made some of her favorite recipes, and watched some holiday movies with her this week since I have a lot of free time during my University break. This way she can enjoy the decorations for the next month during the little down time she has. I feel a lot better having written this :)

I said I didn't want to go and then she said ""I am your mother, you are a minor. You are going where I say."" And I just said no. It kept going like this until she called CHOP (Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia) and said she wanted me to get a immediate mental evaluation.

Would knowledge imply absolute certainty? If someone claims to ""know"" something to be true, does that mean they claim to be 100% sure of it, beyond any possible doubt whatsoever?

If the answer is yes, and knowledge requires absolute certainty, then wouldn't almost every sane person be an agnostic? It would be incredibly naive to think it is absolutely impossible that god does/doesn't exist, completely ignoring even the slim possibility that one's logic or interpretation of reality is flawed. The term ""agnostic"" would apply to almost everyone because no one can claim, with absolute confidence, that they are right. The term ""agnostic"" would be meaningless because it would apply to almost everyone. Calling oneself an ""agnostic"" would not provide any information that constructs an individual identity because the description ""agnostic"" would fit almost everyone.

If the answer is no, and knowledge can account for the possibility of wrongness, then how would knowledge be any different from strong belief? Both would apply to a degree of confidence in one's conclusions while accepting the possibility that the conclusions are wrong. People who were the most agnostic would be the ones with the least confidence in their beliefs, while the people who were the most gnostic would be the ones who claim to be almost certain of their beliefs, accepting only a small possibility that they are wrong.

I am thrilled to see such mature and insightful conversation, so thank you for that!  
  
To briefly explain my present situation:  I grew up going to church, but to my parents credit, they were always open to us forming our own opinions on faith and religion as we grew up.  When I was younger, I think my mind mostly didn't contemplate bigger questions of existence, etc.  And if I ever did, it always came back to the answers that were provided by my church having to deal with God, heaven, salvation, and all of that.  So, I didn't really think or worry about it.
  
I am now in my late twenties, and I've noticed in probably about the past 3-4 years, I have been thinking about my existence in a much deeper and more profound way than I ever have before.  I have also become increasingly disconnected with Christian faith.  I really enjoy exploring different belief systems (in the spirit of Unitarian Universalism), but at the end of the day, I think the most sensible conclusion that I have reached at this point in time is to call myself an Agnostic.  I realize that I simply don't know.
  
Although this deeper contemplation of existence has been positive in some ways, it has really brought on a sense of anxiety that I had never felt before.  I have lost the comfort that comes with promise of heaven and eternal salvation.  It kind of comes in waves, even day by day, or moment by moment.  It is even kind of silly to me, but the thought that keeps churning in the back of my mind is, ""you are going to die someday, and you will no longer exist.""  It's kind of like the opposite of being suicidal, if that makes any sense.. it's like I get incredibly afraid of death because I enjoy life so much.  I feel the weight of the fact that life ends and we do not know what comes afterward, if anything.  Then, I feel idiotic about that because I have a great, happy life, and I am wasting time worrying about the fact that I'm going to die. 
  
So that brings me to where I'm at.  I recently read Eckhard Tolle's, ""The Power of Now"" and it has really, really helped me.  I think it is a great primer in learning to understand what it is to be enlightened, being mindful, and understanding what he describes as the ""pain body"" which I think is part of what is affecting me.  
  
Ultimately, my question is:  Have any of you have similar experiences that have led you to become agnostic, or that have been a result of your agnosticism?  Do you have any other personal suggestions or reading/learning suggestions that have benefitted you?  Thanks in advance for sharing.  I'm really looking forward to your insight.",,False,,t5_2qjrd,False,,,True,t3_uqu4i,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/uqu4i/im_having_some_existential_struggles_anyone_had/,

My experience with my mother was more or less what sealed the deal.

I was 18 (now 23) and was in the middle of a ""crisis of faith"". More like reaching the age of reason. 

My mom came in my room on a Sunday Moring to wake me up for church. I told her that I didn’t want to go anymore and she immediately flipped shit. She started yelling in my face, slapped me, and threw a bible at me. I will note, I remained calm through the whole ordeal. She stormed off to finish getting ready for church. 

Not 5 minutes later, she comes back into my room and says that if I don’t get up and dressed in the next 15 minutes, I better start packing my things. I asked her if that was her decision, to kick me out, and choose religion over her only son. She said no, that it was my decision. I then said, ""Your right, it is my decision to worship or not worship as i see fit. You have made YOUR choice to remove me from your life and your home.""

So I make a quick phone call to my Dad (who was smart and divorced the crazy bitch years prior) and my Girlfriend at the time to come help me grab stuff. I was gone before she even came back from church. 

Now 5 years later and 3500 miles away, she and I still have an uneasy relationship. She is constantly jabbing me with religious propaganda even though, after the whole ordeal, we had a discussion about my beliefs ( I outlined them [here](http://redd.it/sirf3) )

I'm having my own troublesome times currently and would like to share them with you. The source of this trouble comes the lack of faith in a deity, which in my situation is Allah (God in Arabic). Ever since I was able to think critically, I always dismissed the idea(s) of the non-existence of a god. Because of my curious character as a child, I always wanted an explanation of everything. So, over the years I've built upon my faith on so called scientific proof(s). But as time passed away, I found out that I was lying to myself. I've learned that all of my sources of proof(s) were biased. Of course, I went through a rough phase, processing all of these. Several years of cultural indoctrination made the whole process harder for me. But eventually, I've came to the conclusion that: **""No body know what they're talking about.""** I was sad and disappointed.

Now I see religion as a cultural thing, and I know it helps a lot of people to cope up with what they're going through life everyday. But even though I came to the age of 20, I can't confront with my family. Today I've learned that my father told my mother that he was extremely sad that I didn't pray anymore, and said that ""what did we do wrong, raising with him?"". I'm going to college right now, and I can't jeopardize my all I have by confronting them right now.

My last paragraph will be a conversation I had with my mother at a coffee shop several months ago.

**My mother:** Paul (my fake name for the sake of privacy), why are you criticizing your religion?

**Me:** I want to be sure that I'm following the true religion.

**My mother:** You already know you are, thinking to much is dangerous for you. It can take you away from the guidance of Allah.

**Me:** What if hypothetically, we lived in another universe. Let's say the true religion is Buddhism and Buddha is the one true god. You would have been saying the exact true thing there. So in that universe I would go to hell. Now in this universe the true religion is Islam (saying for her sake), and there are buddhists over there thinking just like you. But, they'll all go to hell because they didn't believe in Allah, just like as we would have in the alternative universe. Do you understand my point?

1366045845.0,13,self.agnostic,1cee03,Musings of why the problem of evil annoys me so much as an argument against the existence of a god.,PinkieLaMandy,18,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1cee03/musings_of_why_the_problem_of_evil_annoys_me_so/,"A little bit of background: I had a crises of faith last year and abandoned my vaguely Christian beliefs to become firmly agnostic, veering towards the side of theistic agnosticism.

Browsing reddit, I see ""The Problem of Evil"" come up often in any sort of discussion, debate, or circlejerk about the existence of a god as proof that one cannot exist or, if it does, it is a jerk not worth acknowledging anyway. This, more than nearly anything else, annoys me whenever it comes up and, today, I have finally been able to organize my thoughts in a way that explains *why*.

I am firmly of the belief that evil, true malice, only comes from human beings or any other sentient creature (Dolphins are dicks like us too, so are chimps and any other high-functioning primate). I don't see natural disasters, disease, or nature (animals,plants, falling rocks,ect.) as something that could be considered ""evil"". A hurricane isn't out to kill you, it's an atmospheric disturbance that happens to love smacking coastlines every so often, one that happens more often and with greater intensity as a result of man's ignorant actions when it comes to the environment.  The mountain lion that mauls a hiker isn't evil. Infectious diseases aren't evil, they may feel it, but they're not-though viruses are wonderfully creepy little constructions, but I digress. Even cancer isn't really evil, devastating yes, but it generally has no intention of killing you in the way a crazy ex with a knife does. 

 Evil, as I define it, is all the consequence of our actions-those we commit ourselves, or those of others. Evil is the parent who abuses their child, (sometimes) passing on the same evil that was done to them in the past. War is evil, completely a product of humanity's greed and cruelty-wars fought *against* tyrannical governments or any other good cause I consider to be the product of the antagonist's misdeeds and mistreatment. Most, if not all, of human suffering is caused, one way or the other, by other people. Which, if we're talking about the beliefs shared by the Abrahamic religions (which I am most familiar with- though from what I understand of Buddhism, suffering is considered something a little like my musings above ) fits in with the idea of complete free will-it just seems to me that so many seem to forget, or not even realize, that free will doesn't stop at your will shaping your life, but it has to work against, and suffer the consequences of, the product of the free will of others and vice-versa.

In summation, I am annoyed by the ""Problem of Evil"" because I consider it a false argument, one that, unless you believe that nature is evil (She can be a bit of a witch sometimes, but she's not that bad), proves absolutely nothing. 

I'd be extremely interested to hear any other opinions on the matter :3

I am pursuing the opportunity to enter the great ongoing conversation about religion, philosophy, theology, science, and etcetera, from my specifically, lamentable position. . . Here goes:

As a newly minted practitioner in the field of higher education, I take great delight at the intellectual community that surrounds me (or at least that, which is supposed to surround me). I adhere to a reasonable educational philosophy, which supposes knowledge (in absolute) to be fully unattainable. Certainly, humanity may propose theory, research findings, or strong correlations. But ultimately, we must surrender to the paradoxical conclusion that absolute is absolutely inaccessible. In actuality, authentic learning is only possible through dissonance or intellectual disequilibrium (Vygotsky, Perry).
One may presume that any and every department in our division of the University must subscribe to this montra. Disconcerting as it might be, I've found myself landing a job (happily in liu of economic circumstances) at a state university (publically funded), which is entirely engulfed in the religious tendencies of the close-minded, surrounding, overwhelmingly Christian community. This is so much the case, that colleagues, in addition to students have bantered and proselytized the evangelical dogma, in a revolting way. 
Raised Christian (once self-proclaimed 'born again'), I understand the deeply rooted persuasions of Christian communities. What I cannot understand is such stubborn adherence, in the face of the sweet reason and logic that brought me liberation as an undergraduate.
As I seek to liberate students from intrusive indoctrination, and balance a community-appeasing adminIstration, I am at a loss for direction and guidance . . . And so, I solicit and welcome any advice or insights that may illuminate my darkness in the normally bright prospect of the higher education industry. Thank you in advance.

I've been an agnostic person for this many years and blah blah blah""

Without any unnecessary details, the reason I'm agnostic is because no matter what you believe in, god or no god, Buddha to Allah, you will have a bias. What a men like seem to like to do in this world is stay close to the known and trusted, but should they venture off, it's always in the extreme, and from that theory I have (Keep in mind, I'm no philosopher) thought that's what explains the extremes of the views atheists take and absolute hypocrisy of them. Whenever I go on /r/atheism or talk to my atheist friends, it's back to back contradiction. I'm not saying logically, no logically and scientifically they're sound. I'm talking morally. It's so frustratingly annoying how I'll talk to them and one minute they'll be talking about how they don't need god to care for one another and next thing you know they're bragging about how they completely ""dominated"" in an argument someone JUST for having different beliefs than them. I've seen this too many times and this simply cannot go unnoticed. 

Then you get the religious people... the thing is that it seems to be only a sense of... how do I put this... it seems to only bring a sense of peace at mind at times, which is where I understand the Athiests viewpoint. Yet it just get's the the point where it's too many people saying ""Well, it's right because it's what I've known my whole life."" C'mon. Where's the fun in that? How are you furthering humanity by staying to your roots? It's understandable that you want to stay somewhere were your comfortable, but to what extent is it truly ok? It honestly just isn't exactly appealing. 

The thing both have in common, even though both deny it like a mother-fucker, is that they shove what they believe down each others throats every waking second. That right there is contradictory on itself. Both want to be respected, correct? Then why don't you take the drama out of both and finally actually talk about it and understand one another than forming these predispositions on each other in your own groups? Yes, I understand, ""Mikeyoyo, it's just not that easy"" I get it. But actually think about it. Either accept that you're both argumentativeness hypocrites or talk it out and then one will actually show the truth.

So, let's get to the conclusion and what you guys read all that for. What are we to be considered, because I'm sick and tired of being called just the middleman between the two. A friend of mine said ""Agnosticism is the pussy version of atheism"" while religious members of mine are saying ""You just need a little more faith and then you'll understand."" And it's these biases that are formed on one another that are eventually destroying themselves. I view myself as a true peace bringer and the ambassador between the two at times. That's just pathetic. A man, no matter their beliefs, should be able to talk and understand the other man without getting into a pissy fit just because they can pull the ""Oh yeah, well my friends (what they believe in and their group) said that that makes you guys look like idiots!"" ""Well, my friends said the same thing!""

C'mon. The human race is just better than that. We need understanding if we want to get anywhere.

Anyway, I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense. I just wanted to pretty much talk to people who may actually get where I'm coming from. I'm not trying to be that guy who posts those ""Ohhhh you guys will just be my psychiatrist for the day. Today, Billy said there's a god and I'm not sure there is one waaahhh help me r/agnostic!""

I'll try to keep this simple:

The last few years, I've been studying religion in my own free time and in school (I took a dual-credit World Religion class). I was wondering.. What if the Bible isn't meant to be taken word-for-word? As an Agnostic, I have sided with the Atheist scientific explanations for occurrences (I.E. evolution).

However, from a not-literal standpoint, I think this could go with the Bible. Hear me out: the Bible says God created man from the dirt. If evolution is the case, the first land-based organisms would live in the dirt. Considering the Bible was written for an unintelligent people, maybe this was the author's way of explaining man's origin without detracting from the value of the Bible?

In both attacking and defending the Bible, I've managed to explain every problem with the Bible that has been thrown at me. I've found that I cannot disprove the Bible; I can only have semi-reasonable doubt. But at the same time, there's largely reasonable belief.

One thing that turned me on to theism (It's not a strong point, but it started the fire.) is time. The universe appears to be winding down (supposedly). If it's winding down, common sense would say it had to begin at a point, right? Yeah yeah, big bang yadda yadda. But hold on: how did time start? What happened before time began? Was there a time before time was time? That wouldn't make sense, because if time is not time, then the time before time was time could not be a time. (May have worded that correctly?) This would suggest something that was not bound by time created time. (A creator of reality wouldn't be bound by that reality.)

Anywho, I eventually read enough to say I am a theist. Then, I began studying religion. Eventually, I ended up with monotheism, because polytheism contradicted itself like no other. (in my study, at least) Assuming there is A god, then which is it? I had narrowed it down to Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. I noticed they all accept the Old Testament. And from my studies, there IS a historical Jesus. (Even His resurrection is mentioned in the Acts of Pontius Pilate.)

So what? A prophet existed. Big deal. Eventually, I decided Islam made very, very little sense. It contradicted itself, too. Judaism v. Christianity began. If we take the prophecies word-for-word and literally, Jesus does not fit the description. However, if we look at it from a broad sense, He does. Eventually, I decided Christianity was my belief. Okay, what next?

We ALL know contradictions exist in the Bible. In r/atheism, I have answered all the contradictions that have read. If you post questions or challenges as a reply, I will do my best to counter.

I'm not here to convert people, and I've gone horribly off-topic. But long story short, I feel it's ridiculous to have to defend my faith so much. Can anybody prove religion wrong? I don't want circle-jerks, if at all possible. I'd love to hear both sides of the story.

(Also, no. I don't believe gays go to Hell, I don't believe contraception is sin, I don't believe birth control is evil, and I don't believe non-Christians are damned. I believe that IF God exists, and He is benevolent, He will give all a second chance at judgement. Otherwise, it would be unfair and unjust.)

Thanks for your help! I look forward to answering questions and having my own answered.

I believe more of a Karma based thing. The good you put out will come to you in return, and the other way around. Causality and chain reactions, similar to the explanations given in the movie ""Pay it Forward."" I don't believe it has a ""mystical"" quality, but I do believe it governs the way things operate in this life.
     My religious friends tell me I need to go read the Bible. My atheist friends tell me I need come to grips with reality. Is there no middle ground?
     I'm very open to learning about other religions and adapting some of the philosophy into my daily lifestyle, but apparently that's not right, either.
     There are points I feel both parties refuse to acknowledge. Atheists don't seem to admit or realize that religion teaches morals and serves as a form of government in its own community. At its bare minimum, it teaches us to do good, not bad. Religious fanatics, however, constantly defend their religion and tell people they're going to hell if they're non-believers, which is ineffective. Pretty sure atheists won't really fear something they mock and don't believe in.
     Now I'm not a theological genius, not near to it and I don't claim to be. I'm more of the average Joe looking in from the sidelines and asking what the hell is going on.
     Someone please help me make some sense of this? Are people really that childish? I'm just at a loss. I've had better arguments in Kindergarten about who's favorite color was better than the rest's.

I will explain what I believe: Imagine your life is a movie. In that movie you always wonder if God exists or not. It's a constant dilemma until the end. At the end of the movie you will find out whether there will be a sequel (afterlife) or not (nothing happens).

I have been to churches in the past few years that I know are anti-gay and may not be open to my lifestyle.  I suppose that lifestyle also includes the fact that I'm not pursuing the American Dream, am married but the relationship hasn't changed other than the legal marriage, do not want to own a house, can't decide if I want kids, don't want the stereotypical career, and am not thinking about a future I really can't plan for right now.  My life goal is to continue growing as a person, which leaves me to just live, basically.

Based on what you know about me, do you think I would feel comfortable going to a church with a friend?

The church seems pretty open, friendly, and accepting.  One of the churches I visited a few years ago seemed that way, but were very anti-gay and promoted the American Dream.  I am willing to be able to identify that and walk away and to treat the experience as a positive learning experience.

Another aspect of this is that I am worried any of my reactions will offend my friend.  Any advice there?

Neil DeGrasse Tyson was recently asked by the Templeton Foundation to answer the question ""Does life have a purpose?""  [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pL5vzIMAhs) was his response.  As we all know, Dr. Tyson considers himself to be an agnostic.  However, he clearly takes a stand here on one side of the issue, while still retaining an intellectual humility.  

Similarly, Einstein did not consider himself an atheist, but famously stated ""The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this.""  In my mind, this also displays a clear stance on theism, even though Einstein certainly never considered himself and atheist.

Well, there's probably tons of these submitted already, but I was just looking for some advice on how to approach the matter of my changed religious views with my super religious Christian family and best friend.

__________________________________________________________________________

Well, here's my story. (rant)

I was raised in a non-denominational Christian church my entire life, and had always blindly chosen to believe in God. As a child, I believe that I really had no concept of what God was, and just ""believed"" because it's what my family was doing (it's funny how much sociology in involved with religion). I was raised to believe that we ""shouldn't question"" things and just ""have faith"" that God controls everything. My mother always used Biblical references in raising me, and I grew to secretly resent the Bible's teachings.

As I grew into my preteen years, I started to struggle with depression. Bullies at school, poor body image, and lack of support from my family were all factors to this. At 12, I ""re-found"" God and things started looking up. I took comfort in the fact that ""someone out there"" cared for me. I became a really devout Christian from ages 12-15.

At age 16, though, things started on a slow decline. I began dating (my mom didn't let me date until I was 16) and found that I was way more compatible/attracted to guys that were atheists or agnostics. I always secretly knew this, but tried to convince myself that dating outside of my faith was really bad for me to do. But one day, I took a chance and dated an agnostic. I made him agree (before we started our ""relationship"") that he would respect my beliefs. Well, that ended after a week. He called me crazy for talking about God like he was a real, living person. After that, I decided that dating anyone outside of my faith was never going to happen again. I (stupidly) put all ""non-believers"" under the label of being disrespectful people. Until...

My senior year in high school, I met such an amazing guy. We were perfectly compatible in practically everything. I had a slight hinkering that he wasn't a christian, though, since he always seemed to shy away from discussions about God. I tried to stop myself from liking him, until one day, I just gave up and let myself have a major crush on the kid. Turns out, he was an atheist. When we started dating, I was still kind of believing, but more-so doubting my faith. Things like discussions in my Comparative Religions class and how my church started preaching about ""the evils of homosexuality"" were what really chipped away at my belief in God.

I started becoming scared, though (""What if God IS real and I end up going to hell?""), I felt guilty (""I'm turning my back on what I was raised with...""), and I felt alone (""My entire family is made up of Christians."") But then I began to think... even if God existed, why would I want to ""serve"" a God that has killed so many innocent people (as it states in the Bible and now in modern days)? What God of love would allow such terrible things like that? Why should I believe in God if my only reason anymore would be to avoid hell? (I could go on and on about everything I don't like)

But anyway, he was one of the most respectful guys I had ever met. :) I can't believe I had ever held myself back from liking him just because of our religious differences. Though he did influence me in a way, there were just a ton of things that made me decide to become an agnostic.

______________________________________________________________________________

Now I am over the ""fearful"" transition of becoming an ex-Christian, and have acquired a certain peace about life. I'm not fearful of death, but rather, am ready to live my life and then die when my time comes. I wish I could convey this feeling to my loved ones, but I feel as though they would just ""not have it"" (my new beliefs).

How can I ""come out"" about my changed mindset to them? I don't want to try to change their beliefs (hey, it gives them hope and makes them happy), I just want to try to have them respect mine and stop expecting me to be a christian.

We can learn about how the world and universe existed prior to our own existence, but we will never be able to contemplate living in that world prior to our birth.  In this same way, we cannot comprehend a world beyond our own existence, or what it may be like to experience that world in which we do not exist, because we will simply not be experiencing anything at all.

I grew up believing in a god, when I turned 22 I became a Christian - going to a Pentecostal church. Actually still a member of the same church for almost 20 years.

Then one year I started reading the bible every day. Every single morning I read and prayed. Personally, I was going through some real heavy shit and was on my knees praying to god for help and a true feeling of his love for me. Mainly, because I had never really felt it. It was all in my head that I was supposed to believe that god loved me. But it was never in my heart.

Then one day I started thinking. I have two daughters and if either one of them begged for me to show my love to them I would do it. Especially if I saw the ache and need in their hearts. I never felt this. All I ever felt was that I wasn't praying hard enough, my life was shit and I wasn't worthy of god's love, or something else held my prayers back and god's love from me.

It was always my fault. I was the reason god wasn't showing me his love or answering my prayers. That was the reasoning behind all my pain and fears and torment. Me. My short comings.

I stopped praying. I stopped believing. I become complacent - coincidentally like the god I was praying to. But here's the thing. Here's where I am. I can't shake the fact that this world is made in such a way that we cannot deny that there is a maker. Our own lives, I feel, point to a maker. The complexities of everything I see and feel just can't point to a random act of chance. Can it?

I don't know. All I do know is that now I don't feel so anxious. I don't fret about my ""heart."" I don't fear a so-called wrathful god that doesn't hear me if I do something wrong.

I wanted some advice from other users.  I lived in an apartment complex (from about the age of 15) with about 16 units all of which had Seven Day Adventist occupants.  The manager was SDA and her son was a pastor. My mother moved there because her friend recommended it as a safe place to live.

I had to have brain surgery because of a brain tumor that was discovered.  I have a rare disease called [von Hippel Lindau / VHL] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD3V49-8aBs). Basically, everyone was nice to me because my sickness and over the years I have to have even have more surgery. At the age of about 23 they had to operate on a spinal tumor which left me in a wheelchair. FYI: I am 30 now.

Naturally, everyone prays for me and my mom continues to go to the church and has many SDA friends that visit us. The problem is that I feel pressured into certain things (for example Bible study). Someone asked me how is my study going. I told them it was okay, but I didn't really know that much.  He offered Bible study at this point.

I do not know what to tell him in order to stop the Bible study without offending him as my mom will still probably go to the church and like I said they provide more than emotional support.  For example this guy gave my mom $200 to help with hotel costs the last time I had brain surgery.  I am thinking something like I need some time to go over what we have studied so far as we are going to fast or something like that.

I cannot stop living at home (we have since bought our own home, but that doesn’t really change the situation) as I will probably need more surgery am too disabled at this point.  I still believe in God, but I feel that I should be given the freedom to learn about other religions without the pressure of just studying one religion and accepting everything as true.  I think that I’m in the right subreddit. I agree with [Michio Kaku!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOAj90FPnDs) on the subject.  Ironically, it was the Bible study that make me think this way the first place.

I am in a really tough spot as I do not know what I can do.  Ideally, I just want to be a Christian that has a SDA label.  Are there any that I can show her containing negative Bible verses.  Or something that will help me can ensure why it’s hard to believe in the Bible.  I have found one or two videos, but they are very critical i.e. have titles such as “the Bible is evil “and are presented in a very negative way . I want something that just presents the facts in an unbiased manner.

Thank you in advance for your opinions/advice!

I'm just wondering what are other peoples views on this topic, because I was thinking about it quite a lot lately.
Religions often have plenty buildings, people leading them etc. But are they really needed?

In my view buildings like churches and all the complex ranks people have within the Church (and institutions like it) seem a little... unnecessary. 
Do people really need them? We give off quite a bit of tax money to the institutions plus they already hoarded a lot of property and wealth throught history which could be used in other better ways.
I'm not against them believing in any religion of course, every person has his freedom, but couldn't they just do it without all these things?
If they can't do it without structures because of ceremonies can't we just maybe maintain the already existing structures and build some more here and there if needed? Can't they come and pray, maybe one of them holds a mass every sunday and thats it? Do we need people like the pope enjoying their good lives in huge palaces while others starve?
They represent the very moral of humans but still... they are really corrupt and misguided in my eyes (especially in the past).

I was a traditional Roman Catholic for 18 years, I wanted to become a priest and everything. Then when I went to college, I had a little religious meltdown. I was atheist for a day, Hindu for a week, Buddhist for a week, etc. 4 years later I have basically settled on agnostic with a twist of Buddhist. I don't want to go too much into what I believe, but if you want, look up Possibilianism, that's the best definition I can think of for me. I'm very interested in spirituality, skeptical but interested (once bitten, twice shy). I'm mostly interested from an academic standpoint, but also interested in spiritual growth.

Anyways, I've never lost my want to become a monk. I like the community, the habit, the diet, the spiritual disciplines (meditation, prayer, chanting, etc), time in the day dedicated to study, meditative jobs (mopping the floors, making soap, spinning cloth to make clothes for the poor, etc), but I guess I'm a general spiritualist, I want to improve my Self, to study philosophy, to search for Happiness. I don't know if I'd be accepted into Buddhist or Catholic monasteries. I like the Canonical hours, but I also like the Tipi Taka. I'm sick of Mass and The Church and I don't want my practice to be purely Buddhist. I can't be a normal lay person, the normal day to day life is frivolous, the pursuit of material wealth is unnecessary. A friend suggested I start my own Order, lol, but I could never do that.

Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions? Thanks!

1337438100.0,12,self.agnostic,tuq5w,"I think the main reason that modern society still does not understand a human is just a machine formed of basic elements of nature, is that they don't understand intelligence and consciousness are very specific evolutionary results.",NonAmerican,22,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/tuq5w/i_think_the_main_reason_that_modern_society_still/,"I believe there is a misunderstanding - among even atheists and agnostics - on the matters of consciousness and intelligence which brings as a consequence the very familiar vague concept of Soul.

In reality it is very simple to see how evolution can create human intelligence and how it can create self-awareness.

In the case of the incredible achievement of human intelligence [there are many good theories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence) and possibly most of them can be combined, but my favorite is this:

[Ecological dominance-social competition model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Ecological_dominance-social_competition_model): Basically, on this model humans became intelligent for the simple and very obvious fact that they dominated over nature. It just happened to be a species that was so successful, that the elements of nature were not anymore the primary danger: the same species was. The more intelligent, social, able to organize others against others, was more likely to be naturally selected. This explains also all the human vs human strife in history and why animals basically have more to fear from nature than from their own species.

Now, in the case of self-awareness , it was harder to find why that thing exists technically, as a part of a machine, and it's not really a Soul that does it or a divine power that is planted into us.

But, the answer is simple: It just makes you smarter to have self-awareness, to be aware of who or what you are. It is part of the mechanism of thought. In order to make intelligent thoughts the machine must be aware of its own place in the thought process. But not only that, it must be aware of its own importance in the decision making process. It is not just a variable, it is what must survive along with its companions.

One can go further that and go beyond the thought process: the whole nervous system in organisms, even the most basic ones, is affected by the environment. It ""hurts"" sometimes for example, and the fact you have a brain that can calculate that, it doesn't mean it's that much different from a basic organism that was hurt.


In any case. the point I'm making is, humans are machines. And the fact there could be an afterlife, can not go away easily, unless one sees atheism as a religion, which is silly, but it's very, very, difficult to see a high probability of that existing when in reality, for such an afterlife to exist, since a machine such as a human would go there, then why not simpler machines? Why not dogs and cats? And why not simpler machines? Why not birds like parrots? Why not even simpler machines like insects or bacteria? And in the end, you reach the basic constituents of matter. 

If there is afterlife, even sand will go there.",,False,,t5_2qjrd,False,,,True,t3_tuq5w,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/tuq5w/i_think_the_main_reason_that_modern_society_still/,

Slightly after I entered middle school, I started to change. I don't know what sparked it. Maybe it was the leaving of my friends of the past. I had another interaction with them, and they were completely irrational. I had to realize that that was how I was before, and it was shocking. But that's slightly off-topic. I also emerged from my bubble and learned of what was happening around the world. Linkin Park helped it that aspect. I started acknowledging suffering, but also the more beautiful parts of the world, such as nature and genuine human kindness.  I had to wonder, ""Is there a god who is truly responsible for this?"" I had studied the Bible when I was smaller. I never truly believed that God was responsible for talent, ingenuity, or any good events. I didn't want to acknowledge that though. Did God truly create the universe? I know that we do not have an absolutely solid theory yet. These and many other doubts plagued my consciousness, and I tried to ignore them. And I did, until an adult in my school read one of my stories and said""You have been blessed by God."" Of course I accepted the compliment, but that comment caused my previous doubts to arise anew. If there truly was a God, why was he standing back while his people suffered? Why aren't all his offspring equal in his eyes? Why is he only looking at the people of Earth, and not tending to the entire universe? And if this God has feelings like a person, who says he is fit to rule? If God created us, who created God? And the main question: what is the purpose of life? I couldn't come up with an answer. Part of me wanted to believe all of our mistakes will be forgiven and life was lived for one purpose. But I couldn't. And so I checked out r/atheism, assuming I was an atheist. I saw the atheists there were as extremist as those they looked down on. And I had to reevaluate myself again. I didn't think it was possible, with our current knowledge of the universe, to truly know whether there was a God or not, and which version of that God was true. (I think if there is a God, he would not care about us in particular. He would be letting us advance at our own pace, while monitoring the rest of the universe. But it always comes down to the question of where God would have come from.) I looked into it, and discovered agnosticism. And so I came to r/agnostic. I looked at many posts, and though I may have not participated in many, you guys helped me accept my true thoughts on the universe. I will always continue to ask questions, maybe even help decipher *life*.
I know this is lengthy, but I wanted to share my story with you guys. And now I have a question I hope you all can help me out with. I've noticed that all people I know follow the religion their parents taught them. But someone I am very close to follows the religion of his parents, but he has evaluated it deeply and influenced me throughout this story too. Do others choose their religion because they thought it out or because that's what they grew up with?

1370881899.0,11,self.agnostic,1g1wz0,Is it as complicated as everyone is making it (x-post from r/trueatheism),Rockfiend,14,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1g1wz0/is_it_as_complicated_as_everyone_is_making_it/,"I always get so overwhelmed when people start arguing about what atheism means, what agnosticism means, what theism means...I have been having some identity crises lately and decided to just break apart the word ""atheism"" on wikipedia. I read the overviews only and didn't find anything in them that refutes the quotes I have below. I just wanted to look at the big picture for once.

You look up ""theism""--
Wikipedia: ""Theism, in the broadest sense, is the belief that at least one deity exists.[1] In a more specific sense, theism is commonly a monotheistic doctrine concerning the nature of a deity, and that deity's relationship to the universe.[2][3][4][5] Theism, in this specific sense, conceives of God as personal, present and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe.""

Definition of deity--
Wikipedia: ""a supernatural being, and who may be thought of as holy, divine, or sacred.""

I have called myself agnostic for a while now because I cannot refute a non-religious, non-supernatural higher power with any kind of evidence. However:

Wikipedia: ""Agnosticism is the view that the existence or non-existence of any deity is unknown and possibly unknowable.""

If a deity is considered to be a supernatural being created by religion, then I cannot be agnostic about that because there is so much evidence against that. It is painfully obvious that religion CREATED their deities. It seems that most people I talk to or hear arguing are not talking about this...they are disagreeing about a higher power that is not supernatural that could have instigated the big bang, or something similar. Is this kind of higher power within the realm of atheism, theism, agnosticism in the first place? I did not see anywhere in any of the overviews anything about a higher power type--just deities. Are we all diverting from the real issue at the root of it all--religion?

Now, when I look up the definition on dictionary.com, it is less specific (overly-simplistic in my opinion). The wikipedia articles make more sense to me and corroborate with what I have been thinking for a long time. I just wonder if we all keep arguing about what we think or have been told everything means, or if so many of us are arguing while being on the same side.
I apologize if my writing is unclear--I wrote this in a hurry.

EDIT: Td;lr--According to the wikipedia article overviews for ""theism"", ""deity"", and ""agnosticism"", it seems to me that atheism disbelieves in deities created by religion and not a higher power. Agnosticism says that deities are possible. If this is true then I cannot be agnostic spiritually and I can call myself an atheist while admitting that I cannot prove the existence of a non-supernatural being that has nothing to do with religion to instigate the big-bang. Opinions?

EDIT 2: I think some people are misunderstanding my post or I am not being clear. I am not getting hung up on words...when I read these article overviews, I was shocked that it only mentioned the religion-created gods. I respect most of what I read on Wikipedia, so I was surprised that this was the first time I was being exposed to this. I was thinking, ""if it's only about religion, then there is no way I'm agnostic."" According to those article overviews, I am a staunch atheist. I am the most anti-religion person I know and I have been researching how gods are created by religion for the last couple of years. Since I have identified as agnostic for a long time, this was a little of an odd feeling to me. I began to wonder--if it is all really just about religion, then a lot more people would be atheists. When I looked up Agnostic on Wikipedia, it said that Agnostics believe that the gods created by religion could be real.  That is not me by any stretch of the imagination--it can be shown that the gods created by religion are false.  But when you use agnostic as a descriptor, i.e. ""I am agnostic towards ___,"" then me and a lot of atheists would probably use it for many unknowns in the universe. One of these unknowns is the catalyst for the expansion of the universe, whatever it may be, god or otherwise. It seems that everything else that atheists and agnostics argue about are not necessarily under their umbrella and should just be discussed without those labels or with different labels.

Look, I've been an unbeliever for several years now. I know all the dictionary definitions and I've been reading what people have been saying about all the different viewpoints the entire time. I've read *The God Delusion* and *God is Not Good*, etc. I know what most people say Theism, Atheism, and Agnostic are...and I definitely had my own opinions. I usually go to Wikipedia for a quick reference and it turned out that most people don't agree with their definition, but it is the one that makes the most sense to me. I will probably never tell someone face to face what my ""label"" is, but it is important for ME to know. I have felt a kinship with both groups, Atheists and Agnostics, which is why I subscribe to both and why I find both sides to be compelling perspectives. I think where most of us would staunchly agree is that religion is the problem. That is where I am drawing my boundaries from now on, and it is based on what I consider to be a reliable source and not just on what people are saying or commentary.",,False,,t5_2qjrd,1370954216.0,,,True,t3_1g1wz0,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1g1wz0/is_it_as_complicated_as_everyone_is_making_it/,

1361482936.0,9,self.agnostic,18z9in,This is -in my very own but strong opinion- why the chart is wrong and why agnostic atheists are not agnostics.,raindogmx,26,17,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/18z9in/this_is_in_my_very_own_but_strong_opinion_why_the/,"Ok guys. I don't mean to offend anyone and this is my opinion, I hope it does not sound pedantic but I am just letting it all out. Some of you are still going about this agnostic atheist thing and I understand it. It is very easy to understand, but it is wrong.

Some of you define gnosticism as a position of KNOWLEDGE, which is correct: I am a Swahili agnostic, because I don't know any Swahili. I am an Spanish Gnostic, because I know Spanish but then I could also be a Swahili gnostic, because I know Swahili exists... well, I don't truly know as I have no first hand evidence, but I believe people who claim it to exist and other second hand evidence.

So applied to our Agnosticism, when dealing with gods, agnosticism refers to knowledge about what? Knowledge about the EXISTENCE of god or knowledge about the NATURE of god.

Agnostics are not about knowledge of the existence of god, but knowledge about what this god IS.

I'm going to explain the subtle but important difference.

A typical ""chartist"" (guy who believe in the agnostic/gnostic/theist/atheist chart) will tell you crap like:

* If you KNOW there is no god but you BELIEVE there is no god then you are a Gnostic Atheist.

* If you DON'T KNOW there is a god but you BELIEVE there is a god then you are an Agnostic Theist.

But they will never tell you what happens if you truly deeply don't know WHAT god is.

A definition of god includes its existence. Let's go about one of the staples of e-Atheism: Atheists love to compare the Christian god with leprechauns. What is a leprechaun? A leprechaun is a MYTHICAL little dude that has gold and does not exist. Atheist do not compare God with say, the Higgs boson because we know it is a THEORETICAL particle -and maybe not that theoretical anymore.

Where am I going with this? Well to the conclusion that the definition of something INCLUDES whether that something exists or not. 

Chartists define gnosticism as a position of knowledge about the EXISTENCE of god, but they don't tell you what that god is. They are ambiguous, they will say a it is a ""deity"" or ""deities"", keep pushing them and they will have to come to a definition then you will find up they basically share some form of definition that is compatible with Christian fanatics, an ""omniscient, omnipotent, etc... being"", with the only exception that the atheist definition adds the ""mythic"" attribute to it.

In that sense they are already lost (or found? or saved?); incapable of being agnostics. They have decided on a definition of god to believe or disbelieve. They KNOW.

Now by this point if you still read me you are going to give me the link to Ignosticism in the wikipedia, and I could give you the link to Agnosticism but it is already deeply infiltrated by the Chartist agenda, but I tell you, the true spirit of agnosticism is pretty much compatible with ignosticism always: we don't know what the word 'god' means, we don't know what god is, and some of us BELIEVE we may never KNOW.

You just noticed I mentioned a chartist agenda. Sounds like tin foil hat crap but it's not. It's very human, actually. We can't tolerate uncertainty. If we can't agree on the existence of god we at least may agree on what god is, right? At least we'll be talking about the same standard compatible god. I think we've matured as a species to go beyond that. We live with actual palpable uncertainty everyday. Particle physics is the realm of probabilities and very few certainties, it drives the internet, we live with it, why can't we conceive it? Throw away your definitions.

So in sum, this is the true Agnostic chart:

* Do you KNOW what god is but don't believe it exists? You are an Atheist.

* Do you KNOW what god is and believe it exists? You are a Theist.

* You DON'T KNOW what god is and you believe it exists or does not exist? You are lying to yourself: you can't believe or disbelieve something if you don't know what it is.

If you DON'T KNOW what god is and you can live with that then you are an Agnostic.

And I'll end with a funny cliché:

Agnostic atheists are agnostics without balls :P

Have fun, be excellent to each other.

I have recent accepted the fact that I am agnostic, after a long battle of coming to terms with it. Here is my big struggle:

My husband, his family, and my parents are all very strongly linked in the religion I was raised in, which I have been very active in up until now.

I love my family dearly, I am afraid if I told them I was agnostic it would truly break their hearts. They have been so supportive of me through my illnesses, and through difficult times.

I am also afraid because this religion is very big on guilt, and I don't want them to feel as if it is their fault and they will be held responsible by God for my change of heart.

I would simply continue my service in this religion as a favor to my family and stay silent, but it bothers me to lie about believing in the bible, and believing in things like resurrection and demonic possession.

Also, what if I am wrong? I have no issues with my religion, but would God smite me if I chose to question him? I still have conflicting feelings about God, and that thought terrifies me, as if I am being a doubting Thomas. If there was a creator of the universe, I would want to respect him or her. That's one of my reasons for choosing to become agnostic, because I really don't believe in religion.

Any help, fellow redditors? What should I do? I don't hate my former religion, it's actually a good community for the most part, I just hate lying.

I procrastinated in getting a refill on my blood pressure medication and ran out.  Without it, I get a buzzy-dizzy feeling.  

Today, I went out with my daughter to do some back to school shopping.  She drove my car since I felt so crappy.  We hit a few stores that were packed, carriages blocking every aisle, people wandering aimlessly left and right.  The dude ahead of me in checkout had a price check.  I felt the anxiety welling up.  My daughter took the keys to put our stuff in the car as I went to the bathroom.  I came out to go to the car but couldn't remember where we parked.  No keys to get the beep for a signal, cell phone dead, and no sign of my car or daughter.  Something seemed to snap.

So, I stood at the doorway of the front of the store and meditated.  I said the Serenity Prayer...  ""God, grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the Courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference.""  It did help me calm my anxiety.  

Instead of getting caught up in the anxiety feedback loop, I was able to calmly reflect...  The folks in the store weren't doing anything TO me, although I reacted with anxiety.  Also, I recognized the physical stuff was messing with my head.  I knew my daughter was waiting for me and figured after a while, she'd just get tired of it and come to me.  I reflected that I'm in no danger and thought about 'good stuff'.

Even if you don't believe in God, a wise prayer or meditation can do some good.  Intercession prayers don't work, like praying for rain or to win the lottery.  But prayers that put you in the right frame of mind can get your mind out of the wrong places.

I talked out the anxiety with my daughter, started feeling better, came home and jumped on Reddit.  I saw a nice little thread submission from RickyFromVegas and felt some goodwill.

I was born and raised in a christian family who attended church every week.  Somewhere around 16, I began to believe in other things.  I mostly identify with Agnosticism.  I never brought this change up to my parents until recently.  I guess I never wanted to get into a fight over it.  I don't mind going to church occasionally, but it has been more of a family tradition over the past decade than anything else.

I am now 25, living on my own, and working for a living.  I was in a fantastic relationship for 6 months when I felt I had to address these issues with my parents.  My GF was born and raised in two religions (catholicism/mom and Judaism/Dad) and I felt to properly defend her and get them to respect her; I had to tell them about me.

This was an on-going battle for 4 months.  My dad treated both her and I with little respect and said very little to either one of us.  He would say something about religion to me or try to get me to go to church on occasion, but that was it.  Then Easter came, he mailed a note to my GF that pretty much tried to convert her and get her and I to attend Easter Church (somewhere, not necessarily with him).  

We followed up and said we would be attending my home church but decided to do so before his card.  He then followed up to her reply with an even more religious email.  He did this all behind my back and he barely knew my GF.

I unloaded on him and made it clear that he needed to accept and respect the both of us for who we are despite our religious differences.  I thought I put him into place.  6 weeks later (on my birthday), after hearing nothing from him, he tells us he wants to talk (they wanted to voice their concerns over a christian wedding and how we raise our kids...not their concern to voice to us).  I simply replied, no thank you, it is my birthday.  He erupted into a ball of anger.  He yelled at me, he yelled at her.  He said we had a crappy relationship and blamed my religious change on her.  My mom, like always, took my dads side rather than mine.  They absolutely offended myself and GF to the core.  After 15 min of yelling, we left.  We set up a meeting with them for a few days down the road.

Unfortunately, my GF decided she didnt want to deal with it and did not want to be a part of a family that treats me that way and that treats her that way.

The very next day, they were both involved in a near-fatal incident.  Everything was sidelined while they healed.  A few weeks ago, I started to try and fix things.  I mostly talked to my mom detailing their wrongs and how they mistreated us.  My GF and I have been getting closer and want to get back together.  Her only request was that I fix things with my parents.  I sent a lengthy disposition to them 5 days ago urging them to apologize to my GF, as well as me.  I also included several notes on my beliefs and that their concerns had no right to be brought up to us (but addressed them as well).

It has now been 5 days since sending that.  My mom sent me an apology to send to my GF.  The apology pretty much said ""I'm sorry for what happened"" but didn't say she was wrong or anything.  I have yet to hear from my dad.

What should be my next step?  I tried to tell them that time was not a luxury and needed quick responses.  Does anyone have some advice?",,False,,t5_2qjrd,False,,,True,t3_vopyk,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/vopyk/advice_needed_dealing_with_traditional_christian/,

When everything was hammered out, I felt it may also work in a post of its own. With only 2500+ subscribers, we could always use more posts/reading material for what I feel is a very awesome subreddit. So here goes, my thoughts, no one else'.

Right now there is probably a little girl. Lets say she is currently 7. Her mother and father were tortured and killed. She was kidnapped and sent away as part of a child prostitution ring. She will be beaten, tortured, and left with no hope at all. For her, there will be only a world of hate filled with bad people.

Now, lets say 11 years from now, she is turning tricks on her own. She stays doped up, because that is all she has ever done. It was the only escape for her. She will lie, cheat, steal, kill, and whatever else to survive. She is not your best friend at all; in fact, if you run into her she quickly becomes your enemy. This is all she has ever known after all. 2 years of living like this, she is caught taking from the wrong person. This person has immense wealth, lives like a king, and has respect from many of his peers. He squashes her as a bug under his shoe, or so she wishes. He and his friends take turns on her before giving her a not so swift ending to her miserable story.

Through all of this, she ended up being a 20 year old ""heathen"". She has never once heard God call on her. God abandoned her in all ways, and now she must spend an eternity in hell, because the 20 years on Earth weren't spent living the righteous path she was never offered. Perhaps she was reincarnated into a tree, perhaps her lungs are filled with liquid fire that flows through the very bowels of hell, or maybe she is pierced daily by the elongated nails of demons. Is this a loving God? I can't imagine so. But I feel something spiritual everyday. Something telling me that this girl has justice, for there is none on Earth. I believe that if given the chance all we can do is do what we believe is best. There are way too many variables in this reality. Stories like the one above can kill a man's faith in any God. It affirms mine for some sick reason. I believe justice is the only reason I and many others cannot believe that there is no higher being. 

There it is for your pleasure. I hope everyone has a great day. I will be back after work later on to read and respond if need be.

I would love the opinion of this subreddit.

My thoughts:

1)  I have come to the conclusion based on lifelong fascination with religion and all that entails, plus some recent courses taken, that the gods of all religions do not exist.  That is not to say that I have a staunch opinion on the existence of a higher power/creator type that has nothing to do with religion.

2)  I live my life as if there is no god (s).

3)  I only consider subjects with evidence when facing a question.  I think that the only reason deities become a part of the origins of the universe question is because religious people bring it up, not because they have merit.  Therefore, I do not think that deities deserve even to be a part of the argument in the first place.

4)  When people ask me what my religious beliefs are, I say that I do not have any.  When people ask what my philosophy is, I always say atheistic agnostic.  I say this because I think that saying atheist is making a claim that I am not equipped to supply evidence for; however, it makes no sense to me whatsoever that there is a god or creator type, even one not fabricated by religions.  

In summary, the confusion stems from the question of:  If I live as if there is no god, if I do not give god relevance in any argument, and if it makes no sense to me that any type of god exists, am I really agnostic even though I acknowledge that there is no way of knowing for certain?",,False,,t5_2qjrd,False,,,True,t3_1fgi4b,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1fgi4b/i_call_myself_agnostic/,

I was sent to catholic school from 1st-8th grade then went to public highschool, after that the Marine corps. now I'm in Nursing school at a local community college. 

As I've grown and seen different assets of American life and life outside of America in the poorest of poor situations it's led me to a conclusion but a conclusion that I am willing to say is wrong if given the evidence. I am completely open minded to their being a god and if this god does exist then IT does simply not care about humans or the earth itself. 

When trying to delve into the question of there is or is not a god, One must always take a look at both sides.. always this is not an exception. Those who choose to completely disregard the opposite side, in my view, are incompetent and lessening the possibility of them finding the actual truth. 

The religions that believe in God, and this really pertains to those who are in the 10% of overly religious people, they absolutely refuse to believe that what was written by MEN can possibly be wrong and when there is something that contradicts what they believe in the bible or religious writing they will say things that only prove their point of view. The problem I have with people that are religious is that they are unwilling to admit that they might be wrong when it comes to their views. This to me can only be ignorance.

Now on to the atheists... this is tougher because I do agree with many things if not all the things that atheists say about religion. The major difference is that I am willing to say that their might be a God. And I am willing to admit, if there is actual evidence, that everything in the bible (or any religious text) is true. I can never rule out the possibility that I may be wrong about my views. This is where Atheists and I differ. The same people that say that anything with science is possible, to me, is exactly the same as saying anything with god is possible. 

Now on to both, both of these views are limited by yes or no. either a god (or whichever religious deity you choose) is real or isn't real. Both of these views lead to arguments about who is wrong and who is right. Both of these sides don't give up ground. Both of these sides literally teaches or allows for belittling which leads to anger which can lead to violence. When you allow yourself to believe either way without giving acknowledgement that you may be wrong then to me you are ignorant. 

I feel to achieve the best and most humane way of life is to always believe that you could be wrong. So strive for yourself to find out what you believe to be true not because others have guided your thought but because you have seen more than one side of the coin and can choose what you see is the best path (which I believe can be a mix of both) I firmly believe that science is amazing and that ""god"" has absolutely nothing to do with anything we do on earth. I am willing to admit in both directions that there is or isn't an God, hell I'd be willing to admit to polytheism if I was shown proof. To limit yourself to one way of thinking, in my view, is only restricting your possible knowledge base. And why would you want to do that?

People will often say 'but ideology is beneficial to society sometimes' but that's not the end of it, because it's often not the only ideology, and after all, religion too is sometimes beneficial to some societies.

The most common example of all: Often in politics, proponents of left wing or right wing politics claim that their politics are always superior to their opponents. But are they? There are distinct examples of small European countries that have a large public sector and rich and happy people (e.g. Sweden) or a big capitalist sector and again rich and happy people (e.g. Switzerland).

I am only developing this idea, but I believe we agnostics hold that particular way of doubting to other things. 

I apologise if these examples are too crude, but e.g. I am agnostic about death; it's something that can't be known until you are dead and then well, you are dead. I am also agnostic about the true nature of time; we may make philosophical, scientific, mathematical models of it, but it is something that even though we attest, escapes our full understanding. I am even agnostic about the complexities of economy; I doubt we can ever understand it in a concise and intuitive way.

Those examples are purely personal. I don't think it's impossible for some people to fully understand the flow of economy but I just find it unlikely. It is I who doubt I will ever really, truly, deeply know. 

I find that this way of thinking helps me delve deeper into those topics and maybe the theological conclusion is just a consequence of thinking about the world in an agnostic way. To me agnosticism starts with the humility of accepting I just don't know.

Basically it involves the whole line about tea pots and santa clause and how it is intellectually dishonest to say that we cant make a determination on these issues because we can never know for certain that they arnt true.  The logic goes that here is a point where, even though you can never know for 100% sure that something isnt true, you can still conclude that it is false.  I am not doing this argument proper justice but you guys have seen it probably 1000 times before and I doubt I need to beat a dead horse.

While the internal logic of this point is valid I have trouble when this applied to the concept of a ""creator"" or ""higher being.""  Basically the problem is that for this logic to be valid you have to have some basis on which to determine any relevant probability.  For the tea pot we have no historical record that anyone launched a tea pot into space and for santa clause I personally left presents under trees enough to know what is actually going on here.  But where is the actual physical reasoning on which you can make any probability claim about a creator?  What is the experiment/observation that supports either decision?  The only physical evidence that would oppose a creator is that we dont see one as far as I can tell.  Is that really it ?   Cause I don't find that very convincing and it definitely doesnt even approach the same level of certainty that the tea pot or santa clause analogy would imply and I find it extremely frustrating that people seem to think that it does.  It isnt that there is a 50/50 chance because that would imply some basis for determining this 50/50 chance.  There is nothing on which anyone can make any evidence based claim about the existence of a god so we can make no claim whatsoever !  It is extremely frustrating that people act like there is somehow some basis for making any claim on this point!

However, I do believe in SOME paranormal phenomenon. 

My agnostic and trustable friend told me this story: Him and his parents moved into a house. After a month of living there, he heard a blood curdling scream. He rushed to his parents room, and while he was going to his parents room, he ran into his mom. He asked her if she was okay, and she asked the same, they both agreed they heard a scream. No one actually screamed and all the TVs where off. Also a certain area in the basement was extremly colder than the rest of the basement, and the dogs would always avoid that spot. 

Now here is where it gets weird. A few days after that incident, my friends mom, while out checking the mail ran into the neighbor and they struck a conversation. Come to find out, the neighbor was related to the previous residents and a husband and a wife was murdered in the basement of the house. 

I do trust this Story, but I'm a huge skeptic of ""ghosts"", I myself, have never encountered any ghosts or weird things that would make me whole heartedly believe in them. 

My more open minded part of me says that it could be some sort of ""negative energy"" that lingers in the area of a horrible crisis. That is why most ghost stories involve someone who dies by the cause of a horrific tragedy rather than natural causes. I know in Hinduism and I believe budhisim, they believe that if someone died of suicide, murder, or accident, their energies roams the Earth until they where supposed to go.

Theism, and derivatively atheism, addresses a person's faith in the existence of a deity or deities. Knowedge and Belief are two separate cognitive processes/modes, both semantically and literally. How can some of you claim to be only agnostic? You are either theist or atheist, and either gnostic or agnostic. I would wager that any gnostic, whether gnostic theist or gnostic atheist, is in error.

I don't understand how you can neither believe nor not believe. Once you've examined your feelings you'll surely find yourself leaning in one direction or the other.

I believe there are three main Principles in Agnosticism that truly help define our group of individuals.

**LOGIC**

I was always raised a Presbyterian Christian which tends to be a more Liberal sect of Christianity. Now, I cannot vouch for every Presbyterian church, but we would frequently discuss the moral of Bible verses compared to the literal meaning of the stories. How to properly handle your finances would be an example of a sermon but Bible verses would be used as an example to teach you about the perils of gambling or overspending. 

**EQUALITY**

The only idea we were hard headed about was the fact that Jesus loved everybody no matter their religious affiliation, race, gender, or socioeconomic status. I always treated everyone as an equal. This, I believe, was the reason I find making friends pretty easy despite my slight social awkwardness. 

**TRUTH**

Be honest to everyone was a huge part of the church I attended. ""The Truth shall set us free"" was a huge point. Whether it was with your parents, a friend, or Jesus you needed to be honest no matter how big or small a lie was.

Now granted these Principles were found in religious dogma, but I believe there is a reason these principles are taught for millennial. The problem is these same principles that were used to expand knowledge and gain understanding were being used by religions to suppress free will of the masses. My parents ended up switching to a more conservative church where I found nothing but Propaganda in the form of ""Pay the Church or you are going to hell"". 

Science classes started to make me question the validity of the facts presented in the Bible. I soon realized what the Bible along with every other major religious text was at least in some distorted way, 'Just be a good person'.

We are at a time where we need to start digging now more than ever for the truth. I fear with narrow-mindedness our society will be on the current path of self-destruction as it has been for the past millenniums, but know we have the tools to actually create world destruction at the flip of a switch. This is where Agnosticism Principles needs to be shared with everyone; **Logic, Equality, Truth.**

That would make it easier to talk about. Also, I don't like the way I word things when I explain this, but I'm probably just thinking about it too much.

  I believe in and am thankful for/worship God, but I also embrace science,  believe in evolution, the Earth being billions of years old, possibly the big bang, etc. I believe that there is other life out there, and that the universe/universes is/are an amazing place. I don't follow a specific religion, but I sometimes think maybe all major religions are about the same God, but humans have made them different by making up their own rules and diluting it in general. Maybe all religions are wrong in their own ways, but there is still a God that people are worshiping. 

I believe there's another higher ""level"" where God/the afterlife is, but I don't really think that God interferes with things that happen on Earth/in the universe, but who knows? As for who goes to the afterlife, I really don't know. It was nice to hear the pope say that he believes atheists go to heaven. I'd like to believe that everyone goes to heaven, but there's no way of knowing.

I've considered sharing this with my mother because she has sensed the change and has hinted that she has a listening ear if I need to talk.  She's very understanding when it comes to most topics, but this one has me worried.  The reason is because my step-father, her husband, died unexpectedly in 2009.  She has no intentions of finding another companion and has stated on several occasions with much emotion, that she cannot wait to get to heaven to be with her husband again.

Her faith is strong, so I don't worry about making her question seeing her husband again.  I just worry that I'm going to add unnecessary worry and stress to her life if she believes that when I die I won't be joining her and my step-father.

One of my biggest qualms about deciding that I truly don't believe in the existence of a god is the potential lack of an eternal soul. I don't mean not going to some ""heaven"", but the idea that when I die, that's it, everything I ever was in life ceases to exist. So I wrote a short story that reconciles my need to believe in an eternal soul for living beings without the existence of an omnipotent god or heaven or hell, and I thought /r/agnostic  might appreciate it. ""I died when I was 87 years old. They buried me on a grassy slope overlooking the Pacific. There's something about the living soul, trapped in the fast-paced spark-and-burn-out cage of a human body, which just moves too damn quickly to register all the beauty of the world. But the dead soul is faced with an eternity, a span of time so long that the living soul does not have the patience to fathom it. When they buried me, they planted an acorn a little bit above my simple pine box, not quite six feet under. Now, this acorn above my humble buried box began to sprout its roots. And as my box and my body and the earth became one and the same, the roots of that little nut took the earth and me to sustain its life. And with the passing of many years that acorn grew into an oak, a tree tall and strong and thriving. A piece of my soul lives still within that earth. The rest of it spread throughout the mighty oak, and I felt my consciousness stretch and flex with the sinewy boughs as they reached for the sky. In those early years I overlooked the sparkling expanse of the indigo sea. And over time I let my soul expand to the fleeting green leaves at the tips of my known body and took flight in a zephyr's forceful gust. And soon my soul was of the air and of the land and of the sea. Ages have passed before my many windows to the world. My soul, once bound all in one within a single vessel, has fractured over and over, again and again, until a little piece of me is part of all that makes up this world.

Most religions, at least on a broad sense, claim to offer answers. They support a spiritual quest to find God. This is of course looking past dogma and politics.

I see a lot of people struggling with how to tell people they are agnostic, assuming this means they will be shunned from their religious background. Is this necessary? Or is it that /r/Atheism is leaking again?

Is agnosticism in and of itself against organized religion? Or is it crucial part of religion? Aren't most methods of worship designed to bring you closer to god? If you are unsure of this god's existence, shouldn't you try to get a glimpse if you can? Listen to everyone with an open heart and search? 

Full disclosure, Pi, from Life of Pi, represents my ideal spiritualism. Say yes to every path you have to meet a god. You may or may not find one, but you will expand yourself in looking.

**The One Superior Being Thought:**

(*inspired by [this picture](http://brain-buster-puzzle-pack.brainfunctionz.com/images/brain-cell-and-the-universe-3.jpg)*)

Our entire universe is the single brain cell of a superior being.  Our entire existence is a passing thought of this being.  Our universe was created when his/her cell was created.  Our planet, our history, our lives are the idle thoughts, conscious or subconscious, of this being.  When they forget something, it dies.  When they die, so will our universe.

Take it a step further... we are the superior beings to the universes in our own minds.  By that notion, every person or creature in your thoughts or dreams you don't know to exist in our life exists on some tiny planet within your mind.  That means Middle Earth is real, Hogwarts is real, Westeros is real... just on a different level of existence.


**The Reincarnation Thought:**

(*inspired by [Final Fantasy VII](http://www.finalfantasyunion.com/charimg/screenshots/bugenhagen-solar-system.jpg)*)

We learned from The Lion King about the Circle of Life.  ""When we die our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass.""  but what makes our dead body different from our living body?  The energy it has fused with it.  You can say a rock has energy when it moves, but that's just energy acting on the lifeless rock.  At some point, the energy infused with the matter in a rock, or a bit of water, and became life.  When the energy within us separates from the matter we are made of, we die.  Our matter decomposes and spreads everywhere - it is decomposed by bacteria, eaten by insects, fertilizes grass, feeds other animals, etc. etc.  Our energy does the same.

Like our bodies, the energy stays fairly intact but separate from the body for a small bit of time.  It is able to interact with the energies inside the living - creating the lucid dreams or waking visions of ghosts people believe they see when someone has recently passed away.  Condensed energy can also act by moving objects or becoming light, etc. but this dissipates the energy faster.  As the energy dissipates, it becomes other things - the wind, lightning, or even energy to your home computer.  A part of it may even infuse with other energy to become a living being - a sapling, a puppy, or even a baby person... thus, granting us rebirth.

Of course, memory and thought is stored and created in the physical matter of the brain, so these things are lost with the body making it impossible to remember past lives.  Also, since our energy spreads everywhere like our bodies, we do not wholly become another being, but only a bit of the energy that once dwelled in us would then be in another being, making them a mixture of all sorts of energies which came from all sorts of different paths.

I'm not even sure where I'm going with this, I just like thinking about it...

I believe in science, but I also strongly believe in karma and do think it has its wicked way too often to be coincidence...

The conversation / questions asked are ones I'd like to have / ask with a religious person who has an open mind...

The concept starts with a simple question - if a delivery man delivers a parcel, is the delivery man any less important than the parcel? Is the parcel, in effect, delivering the delivery man?

Most religions believe God is everywhere, that the all seeing omnipotence is influenced in every game of chance, decision, action or reaction. Take a deck of 52 cards. The scientific probability of picking any card from the deck is 1 in 52. So in theory, if said person believes in God, shouldn't he guide their hand to a specified card?

Religious person says maybe. Atheist says no.

The book highlights a point - if you flip a coin 50 times, what's the probability it's heads.
Religious or not, the answer is 1 in 2 times, or likely heads will come up 25 times. However, most coins are not equally balanced, the heads side is slightly heavier, making tails very slightly more probable.

Actually, in the book, it's asked why is it 50% probability. Has anyone actually proved this? And if something so fundamentally simple can be taken for granted, yet questioned so easily, then how much do we really know about the reality around us?

Building on this, is a religious person saying God knows the outcome of the coin before you flip it?

r/atheism did highlight if the sun, on a long enough time line, could destroy earth, why would any God design a system so flawed? Along with the appendix and wisdom teeth, among others.

Now, assume I am God. All seeing, all knowing, spanning time and space. So, I now know the outcome of mankind, and when man reaches that penultimate plane of existence? Then what? Do it all again? This is akin to a director making a sequel movie with the exact same plot. What's the point? This isn't some show someone's watching like Big Brother to see what we do. 

A point I'll add here - we don't know we're not some experiment inside a dish. To us, our universe is expanding. So does cake or bread in an oven. We observe time as seconds, based on the time it takes earth to revolve around the sun. We measure distance using arbitrary numerics. Who's to say 1 metre isn't infinitesimally small relative to whatever is outside our universe?

Back to the God argument, all seeing and all knowing... Knowing the end before watching the beginning seems really, really, really boring. So why start at all - why do anything, if everything is pre determined by your hand?

Which moves to the last point of mine and the book. What if the universe was created by an omnipotent being destroying themselves? We cover both big bang theory, and the religious nut jobs are right in the sense of a God being in everything and everywhere...

I'm not here to trololol, I'm not a great scientist or a nutcase religion follower. I haven't read the Bible or other religious texts. I do like to question stuff, though. I probably can't answer questions about science any more than Christianity.

",MrsChimpGod,11,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/x0o25/went_to_a_psychic_medium_yesterday_ama_or_ready/,"All last week, thinking ahead to my appointment with the psychic medium, I kept replaying Joni Mitchell's 'Song for Sharon' in my head - ""There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street.  I went in to see her as a kind of joke.  She lit a candle for my love luck and 18 bucks went up in smoke"" :-) 

--------------------------------------------------------------


I have a big family, lots of sisters &amp; a couple of brothers.  Raised Roman Catholic.  Dad passed about 20 years ago.  Mom passed about 10 years ago.  One of my sisters lost her 17yo daughter &amp; 10mo granddaughter in a car accident about 6 years ago.  

That sister connected up with a relatively well-known psychic medium, [Moriah Rhame](http://www.moriahthemedium.com/) &amp; arranged for a reading with her shortly after her daughter passed away.  

This lead to further readings amongst my siblings.  We did a family one where we were all there in the old family living room, hearing messages from our ancestors, from our folks.  It was a nice family get together, we laughed &amp; shared memories &amp; stories. Some of us, including me, did private readings that day, too.  

A year or two later, my sister arranged for another girls night reading, where I bought another 15 minutes.  

And, then, yesterday, she did the same &amp; I went along for another 15 minutes. 

-----------------------------------

Yesterday's reading, like the ones before, seemed deeply comforting for my sister - the one who lost her daughter &amp; granddaughter.  She is still working through her grief &amp; gets great peace from these readings.  Even if it's not 'real', the peace that Moriah brings to my sisters life is invaluable.  

For me, though, the skepticism keeps poking me throughout.  Skepticism with hope dancing around it like a little child, telling the questions to be quiet &amp; let the hope have fun believing.

As with the previous two readings I'd done, some things were pretty right on.  For example, one of my cats had passed away late on Saturday night.  We left to go to Moriah's at 7:30am the next day.  In my reading, she described my father sitting with two cats and laughing, asking ""Why am I suddenly the pied piper of cats?"".  Definitely how my dad would react &amp; just the kind of thing he would say.  

And, some of the things were completely off base.  Such as my mom telling me to get an above-ground pool to relax in because ""you always wanted one &amp; never got it"".  We *had* an above-ground pool when we were kids.  In fact, when Moriah was at the reading at our family home, she certainly saw the above-ground pool right there in the back yard.  So, if *she* was faking it using research, then she really messed up there. 

And, in my reading, my dad talked to me (again - he's done this in previous readings) about getting the 'helicopters' out of my gutter.  But, he didn't mention at all the 40-foot pine tree that fell down in my yard two weeks ago &amp; the huge stump that still remains.  

------------------------------------------------

My other sisters reported similar outcomes from their readings - some dead on, some vague, some the same as last time but still hadn't come to pass. 

Overall, I've decided, that these readings leave me feeling like either 1) It's not real at all, complete guess work that sometimes gets it right or right enough that you feel good about it.  
or
2) It is real, but the spirits of my ancestors don't really care all that much about me personally, aren't really paying all that much attention to what's going on in my life specifically.  (Which is similar to what it was like growing up one of 10 children in a family, if you want to get all psychological about it)

I consider myself not an atheist, but an agnostic.  This means that I try to live my life according to what I think is good and fair, even though those are fairly subjective and context-sensitive words. I tend also to be rational and more scientific (show me/prove it) than taking things on faith or reputation. 
To me, atheism is still a belief, since you cannot prove the absence of a god-like being just as much as you cannot prove the presence of it.  Atheists seem to 'believe'/'have faith in' the fact there is no such divine presence. This point is very important to me, since that should I come to die, and I am somehow sorted into a cloudy or a fiery club based my my conduct in life (or any other kind of afterlife) I have no-one but myself to blame/thank. Disclaimer: Not expecting this to happen. 

Science is the body of activities and knowledge gathered from observation.  Whenever I'm discussing religion with people, I often hit this snag:  Since it's all based on observation, at one point or another this comes down to human observation, which we (scientifically) have proven to be flawed.   Science is also based on certain axioms that we hold to be true without having proof for them.

Other than being internally more consistent, what makes science then better than the faith held by anyone?  Does science at a certain point not assume that what you see/observe/measure is actually what's there? Even Science has to put faith into some things?  To me, science is making a model of reality, then continuing to refine that model until everything fits. 

I tried using faith here, instead of religion, because the various deity-fanclubs around the globe lack the ability to prove to me that they are consistent and not driven by financial, political or personal motives by their thoughtleaders and scriptures.

can you help me bring some order into this?

TL;DR what makes science better than faith? Can you disprove a deity?

Some people claim there is nothing more than what we are and all people of religions are ill-informed. It is possible, to have a deity(s) in much higher dimensions. If there is some sort of heaven, it might be being advanced to the next higher dimension.

If this dimension theory were true (it could be, who knows…), it would be impossible for us to grasp, so how could one claim with 100% certainly, nothing higher exists, be it God, Buddha or what/whom-ever?

I don’t really like the term “agnostic” to describe how I rationalize it all. I consider it more of being religiously transcendent.

Does anyone else feel this way? Any thoughts about any of these points?

However, there is vocal community here who doesn't like that definition, and for the sake of productive conversation, I'd like to explain the two intents on the sidebar. The goal is that people can understand where the other is coming from in discussion, and allow us to work forward with an understanding of what others mean, which seems the ultimate productive goal of language.

If the subreddit would please provide their favourite (concise!) definition of the second definition of agnostic (which rejects the chart), via upvote, I'll update the disclaimer on the side to explain both of these views (if the other mods are ok with it) and then hopefully we can all understand each other and move on, holding our agnostic'y discussions to our heart's contents.

As stated in the title I felt the need to vent a little. I had an enjoyable weekend with my future in-laws save for my fiancée’s dad has gone off the religious deep end (with good reason in my book, as he is so far beating colon cancer). Her family is aware and generally ok (in conversation with me) that I am an agnostic/weak atheist. But with , let’s call him bob, he has decided it is his duty to convert those around him to his specific interpretations of the bible. Which is rubbing their mostly non-denom christian family the wrong way. For me how ever it’s becoming  an offense to my being, and I have no one to vent to, and even with the rest of them when religion is brought up "" I will see the light and how things are guided by an external power"". My mom is less dogmatic but I don't want press my views on someone else and offend them in the manner I'm being offended. I think people should believe what they want and keep it to themselves. Unfortunately my views on the supernatural mean that the in-laws feel I need to see the light. 
 It isn't normally a problem but as ""bob"" gets more and more reinforcement that his dumb luck ( he ignored at least a month of bloody stool before going to a doctor) is a divine act, and his interpretations of a book (that has been re-printed and translated many different times with different political objectives) are 1000% correct, and that I am somehow endangering his daughter and future grandchildren because I don't believe.  Of course, I don't care what my fiancée believe provided she doesn't join some branch dividians group. 
Idk it would just be nice if I could talk to them without my voiced opinion of “ I just don’t see it” being taken as ‘I’m telling you your wrong’.

I was brought up in a Catholic household, and the school records show this.

So it seems my son has been attending 'Scripture' classes with representatives of the Catholic Church every week. My son did not know the difference between his regular classes and the religious ones. He seems indifferent to the content provided in these classes. He has mentioned the classes are boring, and admits that he does not pay attention much to the two gentlemen who run the classes.

I have no problem with my son learning about different faiths and religions. But I feel a little bit uncomfortable with him getting a one-sided view from the Catholic Church.

I will contact the school as soon as I am able, to discuss why he was automatically assigned to these classes. It is a little bit strange that a **public** school in a very multicultural part of Sydney would automatically send a Kindergarten student into a Catholic scripture class (regardless of my upbringing, or of my partner).

But before I speak to the school, I would like to discuss the *general topic* of faith and spirituality with him. To at least understand his opinion (regardless of its simplicity). It is something my parents never attempted to ask me about when I was growing up, especially when I first started to question various things when I was 7 or 8 years old. For the record my son is almost 6 years old, and is unbaptised. The only Christian traditions my family specifically follow, are extended family gatherings during Christmas and Easter.

So;

What are some simple, kindergarten level questions I can ask my son, to grasp his general understanding of faith and religion?

Is it inappropriate of me to withdraw him from the Catholic only classes if I personally think they are inappropriate and unnecessary? 

If my son does have basic religious feelings, what is the most appropriate way of addressing his needs without biasing him with my own???

Edit: As the school has been sending him to these classes for some time now, I feel a little uncomfortable about how to approach this. I just wish the school spoke to us FIRST.

Over time I've come to be more of a pragmatic agnostic since I don't usually give the subject of religion vs irreligion much thought since it doesn't directly apply to my daily life. But this is one question that's nagged me forever. I can't tell whether I'm more agnostic or atheist. Unlike atheists, once again I'm not at all passionate about the religion vs irreligion debate, and also I strongly side with the possibility of supernatural things and other things that an atheist would immediately shoot down.

Over time I have learned about many different religions as well as non religion specific hypotheses about ""big questions"" to make sure there was absolutely not one that hit me like ""this is definitely what I believe"" - and there was not such a thing, but there are some that were interesting or with good ideas, yet still not believable enough for me to subscribe to. Then there were others that always came across to me as something I absolutely disagree with, to the point that even if hypothetically they did come out to be true I would rather be persecuted than be forced to believe those religions, because I simply don't side with them morally or otherwise.

I believe that any random person could decide to make up a totally fictional cult for ulterior motives, and in some cases they could become so widespread you may not give much second thought as to whether it's fake. I believe that with at least some major religions this has happened. I believe certain religions are only harmful and I have much to disagree with them and they're probably just a human scam, or controlled by something evil. Once again, there are some on the other hand that I would give the benefit of the doubt so I'm not dismissing all religions.

So how open minded about religions do agnostics have to be in order to be considered agnostic? Can they dismiss certain beliefs in favor of others?

As a first time poster I am interested in what you have to say. 

I am currently enrolled in a Creationism vs Evolution class at the University of Minnesota. Very informative and very insightful into the United Stated of America justice system. I have grown up and lived Minnesota all of my life. As a white Catholic female growing up, I was on no end of religious bashing or hatred in my small town of just about 5,000 people. About senior year of high school I began to think critically and discredit my religion in which I was raised and believed to be true.y parents had overtly discredited but still belived there was a God. I still do not quite believe that even though it may so be true (which is why I idwntify myself as agnostic).  The ultimate question in which I am attempting to retrieve is, is discrediting Christianity (because that's what I grew up to believe is true) hatred?  So much of the class is which I am taking is devoted towards court cases in the United States. I would appreciate an outsiders point of view on religion in America and around the world.

Buddhist is considered a religion, but don't believe in a god. From most of what I've learned so far their thoughts on a god's existence is similar to ours. To Buddhist a god's existence isn't important compared to the way you live life. It seems to me Buddhists are agnostics as well and just don't use the word. Still they differ from labeled agnostics in one major way. They, as a community, see to strengthen there moral base to live better lives. Without being in a community to talk about our morals I assume the majority of us form a moral basis on our own or simply don't have one. Does anyone here think forming your own moral basis is better or do some of you think a community would be a better way to go?

I use computer software a lot, and do web programming. I have learned that software is made up of logical evaluations and procedures, and produce certain output based on input received. I have learned that the high-level language statements I type are then translated into a ""machine readable"" format closer to basic ""on/offs"" and ""memory locations.""

The logical evaluations can be represented to the hardware by electronic ""gates,"" originally using vacuum tubes and evolving to smaller means such as the transitor. The physical space required for the gates and memory is constantly shrinking and evolving.

I have learned that certain materials conduct electricity, and it's possible to make a system with simple logic gates in your garage, using wires and larger transistors. Research has allowed us to make much smaller and more effective conductors for much smaller microchips.

So electricity strobes through these conductors at a *very* high rate of speed (the ""[clock cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_per_instruction)""), taking the appropriate routes through the gates and manipulating the appropriate memory locations.

I have known about the concept of electricty from a young age. Electricity starts at point A, passes through the conductor, and arrives at point B. You can't always see it, but with stronger currents you can feel it if you touch it.

Really, all this equates to is a very broad overview of the process, and it wouldn't be nearly as detailed if computer technology weren't ""a thing"" for me. All *I* can be absolutely sure of is that when I save:

    echo ""Hello, world!"";

That it indeed outputs to the screen when I refresh. The flow of electricity doesn't really make *that* much sense to me, I just know it produces an effect that has been explained to me and observered at an always-limited tier of understading.

This ""tier of understanding"" is present in everyone, about every concept ever conceived, and every idea ever brought to fruition (e.g. - the lightbulb, Christianity, or Buddhism).

Certain other people will always have a vastly greater grasp on certain aspects of how computers and electricity work, but there is always that ""tier of understanding,"" with everyone.

After that point is the truest form of blind faith.

My fingers move when I'm typing an email. That is something to do with the brain sending ""signals"" through my spinal cord and reaching my fingers' nerves, causing them to move as instructed. That's most of what I know there, after that it's only a faith that I never even need to consider. It pretty much ""just works.""

I plant a seed, and something usually grows.

I drink some wine, or coffee, and my consciousness is altered.

I see a rainbow in the sky sometimes, something to do with moisture and reflection. A glass prism can also produce rainbow colors.

I dial a number on my cellphone, and I'm talking to the person or leaving them a voicemail.

I turn on the shower and there's clean water, something to do with plumbing, septic systems, city water or wells, and natural water supplies. I flush the toilet and the waste is gone, by similar systems.

I strum a guitar and I hear musical notes, something to do with vibrations and frequencies producing certain pitches, and then stimulating my eardrums through the air. Apparently, I can hear a lot of them at the same time, to form chords and every other sound my ears are picking up at a given time.

So, there are certain people who might say, ""well, I can explain how a plant grows after a seed has water and a place to root!"" But I present the point that it can only ever be to a certain (if extremely rare) ""tier of understanding"" and that every human being is living life with a reliance on a tremendous amount of what could be accurately defined as ""blind faith.""

______________

in the beginning man wondered to himself

why oh why are we here

and yet with each asking of this question

the answer would become

even less clear

.

overwhelmed by fear

distraction took its place

and so it was

in the world’s first shelter

that we began

the human race

.

the human race to fill up

more and more

empty space

.

oh how we love the human race

.

till one day this one guy said to this other guy

he said “hey have you seen that guy over there?”

“he’s got more than everybody else has got “

""to me that don’t seem fair""

.

the second guy agreed with the first guy

everybody else did too

till they all got so worked up

they figured there was something they just had to do

.

divide his things up among each other

*after they killed him of course*

so they could see no real good reason not

to just take what they wanted by force

.

but when they found him he said

“hey wait a minute fellas”

“i wouldn’t kill me just now”

“you can see that i’ve got more than any of you have ever got”

“wouldn’t you first at least like to know how?”

.

and with that he had their attention

and with that he went all loud and clear

he said “y’all know how long we’ve all wondered”

“why oh why are we here?”

.

“well today i’m gonna tell you all about it.”

“i’m gonna teach you about suffering and bliss.”

“i’m gonna teach you all a little about heaven and hell,”

“and the god that gave me all this.”

.

“god gave me this.”

.

“because i’m humble. and he can do the same for you too.”

‘but if you’re seeking his love and affection,”

“what you’re doing is the last thing i’d do.”

.

“he sends killers to hellfire.”

“both here and eternally.”

“the good live forever in a place called heaven.”

“god told me this personally.”

.

who you gonna trust in?

you can’t trust me

.

“so unless you want suffering and heartache”

“unless you want trouble and fear”

“you better find some kind of way to humble yourself man”

“i suggest helping me clean up around here.

.

“of course i could pay you a little bit of money, but”

“more importantly - god would see.”

“and if he sees you working humbly,”

“he may give you what he’s given me.”

.

well the crowd just didn’t know what to do with that

nor could they prove what he said wasn’t true

and since he had what everyone else thought they wanted

it seemed like a thing to do

.

and with that we roll into the future

**and ain’t it a son of a bitch**

**to think that we would still need religion**

**to keep the poor from killing the rich**

.

who you gonna gonna trust in?

you dont trust me

Thanks again for the help i'm sure you will come through for me.

---------------------

We can't be sure there isn't a god or that there is.

This is due to the nature of god. If he was an all-powerful being surly he could hide from us.

However we can say the god of the bible does not exist. 

This is backed up by the old argument written by Epicurus around 341-270 B.C.E
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?

This fully disproves the biblical God. 

But let’s not be rash god could exist. He could just be an entity that created the universe and just watches it progress with no interaction.

Maybe he judges us but at no point interacts with us. 

This is why it is a stretch to say there is no god because the possibility of a god that leaves no proof exists. 

So to sum up a god or gods could exist, however the biblical god does not. The key here is that we shouldn’t make decisions based on the possibility that a god exists because we don’t know. So just live your life, have fun, and be a good person. I’m sure (god/other humans) will be proud of you.

I have no proof of the existence of God. I have no proof of the non-existence of God. I've pondered that God does exist; that *He* created the universe and all that is in it. That Jesus Christ must have been here because there were so many accounts about his life and that has held up for over 2000 years. That, Christianity is the only religion which demands acceptance of Jesus as Savior (or else) and that Jesus *left* the earth. I am not certain that his 2nd coming is a promise or a legend. What appears to me to be somewhat evident (based on personal experience) is that the concept of God in a box being **the big bang** occurred and that having set in motion the expansion of the universe, *He* observes what *His* creation is doing, what it collectively chooses and continues to do so as it expands, grows and becomes what ever it will become; that includes it's own destruction as well as it's own unification.

Personal experiences of mine have been emotional, enthralled with religions at various periods of my life. Almost as thought I were *in love*. There too have been times where I have been *unlawful, rebellious* almost like a married man goes out to cheat on the wife only to come back to loyalty. And finally there are times of void; no conscious awareness of any belief, just living. No matter what, I have either been aware of living my life as though I had a mission and other times where I appeared aimless. TODAY, I am in a place as I have been for the past 4 months or so, where I am aware that I am not *hearing* nor feeling the active presence of any spiritual entity. So the label agnostic atheist *seems* to fit. 

But one final CLAIM I wish to make is that **I have not rejected any of my [former] beliefs**. They were valid for me in their own time. They are part of me no matter what. I find my conclusions, my philosophies are like ripples in a pond. When they are active they are like a rock thrown into the water, where the ripples wave out but eventually fade. Then another rock it tossed in, rippling to fade. I have observed patterns in my life of such obsessions almost manic, followed by periods of flatness, almost depressive. I have never been diagnosed bi-polar nor have I ever written like I have today. This is the most honest I have ever been with myself. I have lived duplicitous for fear of rejection/condemnation, have rationalized, have treated myself chemically (substance abuse/alcohol) have been a fanatical athlete, been back to my Catholic roots and many other religions throughout my life. I know in my *heart* the I am good; that I am grateful for my loving wife and my current circumstance.

Today I am fully aware that my belief system is ambiguous and non-committal. Does that make me wishy-washy with no credibility? I don't think so. I think it defines me as a seeker who still hasn't found what I am looking for or something that truly fits. I am nearing the end of my 5th decade of life. I am doing my best to accept myself as one who's convictions change like seasons. I give myself permission to do so.

The argument I'm about to make does not, in my opinion, apply to other definitions of agnostic (feel free to dispute this if you like).

I've read a few posts on this and other similar subreddits (eg r/TrueAtheism and r/agnosticism) recently, and something that stood out was the use of the word 'supernatural'.

I define supernatural as something beyond the laws of nature, and therefore to the best of our knowledge impossible. I believe there is nothing supernatural because according to all the natural laws I know of, it is something impossible. I would not consider the possibility of a person turning into water then back into a person, because it breaks rules that I have seen proven; it's supernatural. However, I can imagine that, with a comprehensive understanding of the human being and the right technology, it would be possible to deconstruct and then reconstruct a person flawlessly to 'teleport' them. This does not break any natural laws I am aware of.

Not all definitions of deities require them to be supernatural, but I consider, for example, the Christo-Judean god and the Muslim god to be supernatural. Given this, I not only do not believe in these gods, I believe that they do not exist. If anyone gave me reason to believe these gods are not supernatural I would stop believing that they don't exist (although I would not believe that they did exist until someone gave me reason to).

So I appeal to anyone who doesn't believe that these gods don't exist to explain to me why. Please note I'm not trying to convert you, because I don't care what you believe - the fact that you subscribe to this subreddit suggests that you aren't a zealot (either for a religion or for atheism).

",BlanketSlayer,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/v9alo/if_it_wasnt_a_guardian_angel_then_what_was_it/,"I grew up in a Catholic household was always fed the belief in guardian angels and God looking out for me. I no longer believe any of that but I do have a story from when I was younger that puzzles me.

When I was about 19 years old I still lived at home and we lived in a major city in a not very nice area. We did not have a powered garage door so to park my car I would need to drive through the alley, line the car up, then get out of the car and run between mine and my neighbors garage to get to my yard and go inside the garage and open the folding doors out. I did so and after I pulled my car into the garage I turned it off and as I was getting out of the car I heard in my head- very clearly- ""grab the machete"". The Walmart bought machete was behind my seat and was a ""sorry"" gift from a friend who accidentally shot me in the back with an airgun. Not relevant to the story, but felt that needed to be explained. Anyways, this ""voice"" was different than my typical inner monologue and it just felt urgent and blocked out whatever other teenage thoughts I had. So I grabbed it, walked to the garage door with the machete in my left hand and as I bent down to pull the bar holding the door open in place a man suddenly stepped around the garage door. In a very quick moment, he looked at me, looked at the machete which I unknowingly was holding in a ""ready to chop some limbs"" way and then he backed off and ran down the alley. It happened faster than I could process and I didn't fully understand what just happened until after I closed the garage doors. 

I still think about that from time to time and occurred to me to ask on here and see some other opinions. Was it some type of instinct kicking in or what? It's been 12 years and I can still think pretty clearly to that moment and that imperative feeling to JUST GRAB THE MACHETE.

(i) The conditional probability that our cognitive faculties are reliable, given naturalism together with the proposition that we have come to be by way of evolution, is low [P(R/N&amp;E) is low].

(ii) Anyone who accepts (believes) N&amp;E and sees that P(R/N&amp;E) is low has a defeater for R.

(iii) Anyone who has a defeater for R has a defeater for any other belief she thinks she has, including N&amp;E itself.

(iv) If one who accepts N&amp;E thereby acquires a defeater for N&amp;E, N&amp;E is self-defeating and can't be rationally accepted

Conclusion: N&amp;E can't be rationally accepted.

It's been 1 year since I raised my hands at the sky and said ""from now on...fuck you!"", and became an agnostic.

At first it was a little hard because I only felt I don't want to believe in ""God"" anymore...I didn't quite know what to believe in. So I started researching and ultimately found out about agnosticism. I was happy about it. It made me feel like I ""belong"". Before this decision I was very pious. I'd go to church and always pray and totally devoted myself to religion. Right before I made the big step, I was between 2 of the most important exams of my life. I just said to myself...you know what...I wanna see how it is not to believe (this curiosity mostly driven by speeches from George Carlin). Well here I am now, alive and well and honestly nothing really radical happened. I used to be afraid of a life without ""God""...but it really doesn't matter. I can do any of the things I used to as well as before without any kind of ""divine punishment"". The only real change is that now I am not limited by that fear that christianity builds inside you. I don't have to be afraid to question god or religion or the church. I don't have to be afraid about questioning our roots as a race or the limitlessness of the Universe. I'm not afraid to be very keen on space colonization and technological evolution. I believe in science, I believe in technology, I believe in us as a race...united by the goal of improving ourselves and discovering the things that surround us.

You can be a moral, well educated, respectful human being without ""God"" just as well as with him...you only need to want to. (This is the main thing I noticed during the transition)

I don't care if somebody is christian, or muslim, or jewish or whatever...I can respect them trough the prism of morality, respect and education. I try to understand every religion and beyond that respect the human being for who he is and what he does in life not for what god he prays to.

I don't say we are any better than anyone else. As I mentioned, it matters if you have something in your brain, not what you believe in. I never told anyone to be an agnostic because ""we are better"". I just think that acceptance, morality and education are the way to go. And I will never judge anyone for believing anything else. Everybody is free to do and believe in whatever they want, and as long as they are not...(literally) dumb...they will have my personal sympathy; if not, i will never tell them to change or judge them in any way...it's their own choice of life...if it's a bad choice (in my eyes)...then it will only make me sad..

After what I read I still did not know what I believed and yet I was content with my belief in a higher power so to say. About 2 years I dated a hard-core atheist and that is when I started to crumble and lose faitha  little bit. 

I am starting to pick up my faith, again. I do believe in god, but I am not fully convinced that Jesus is the son of god, but yet more so a profit at most. But I line other things up with other religions and I dont know where else to turn. I thought about visiting a church and speaking with a priest to see if my views will change, but I dont want my views to be based on something someone tells me. 

The reason this problem is becoming more important is because I feel like I have met the guy I am goign to marry. We have spokena bout it, but we ahve not talked about religion. He is a catholic (as far as how into it he is, I do not know. But I know that he is catholic and I know if we have children he may want them to fallow the same beliefs as children.) I do not want to bring up this topic with him, because I do not want this to be something that is influenced by him what so ever. I want this for my own. This is something I want for myself. 

* As far as my beliefs go, I do not believe in original sin. There is no way that I believe god would punish a child for what their parents have done in their past, as they have done nothing wrong. 

* I do believe in Karma and everything happens for a reason. Whatever reason that is and you get what you deserve. Life will work its way around to you and get back at you eventually. 

* I am not quite positive (as said above) on the part about Jesus being the son of god. Though I do believe he did have good intentions and fought to bring good to the earth, I am not convinced, however, that he could be the flesh and blood of the holy spirit. 

* I do believe in ""god"" or whatever what fits me calls him. I believe is his our creator and he put us on this earth for a reason. 

* I believe in reincarnation. I believe it is fully possible, and I believe that we may, if we are lucky have more than one journey on this earth as our souls will carry on to the next realm when our journey is over and we have completed what it is that we are here for (weather we remember it or not or this is our first time on this earth) 

Those are just a few that I can think of. I dont believe I am muslim, as I had a deep discussion with my mother about that today. But Iwould like to get a good idea od where I am in this. I feel like I need it to be complete.

atheist - agnostic atheist - agnostic - agnostic theist - theist - religious


People often say that it requires no belief to be an atheist, to deny the existence of any god.  I however, would disagree, and would claim that theists and atheists both make assumptions, or ""beliefs"", about our universe.


I hold my ground on the basis of intuitionistic logic, an formal system of logic, a branch of constructive logic, in which we do not accept the law of the excluded middle.


That is, in classical logic we assume a statement is either true or false, regardless of our understanding of the statement.  So essentially statements ""live"" in a discrete space of ""truthiness"" or ""falsity"", and we are to discover where each statement lies.  If we show the statement does not reside in the space of falsity, it must lie in the space of truth, even if we cannot show it does.


However, in intuitionistic logic we approach statements differently, not assuming they already reside in either ""truthiness"" or ""falsity"".  In order to determine where an statement resides, we must be able to prove the statement actually resides in ""truthiness"" or ""falsity"".  It does not suffice to take a proof that it does not reside in one, as a proof that it resides in the other.


Those are a lot of words, but essentially if P is a statement, not not P does not imply P.


From the wiki on intuitionism:

""If a statement P is provable, then it is certainly impossible to prove that there is no proof of P. But even if it can be shown that no disproof of P is possible, we cannot conclude from this absence that there is a proof of P. Thus P is a stronger statement than not-not-P.""


In application: Take P to be the statement ""no god exists""


Apply the second sentence of the quote to this statement.

No disproof of P is possible, since there is no discrete evidence supporting that a god exists, we cannot however conclude that there is a proof of P.

We only show that there is not not no god, but we cannot jump to the conclusion that there is no god.


To be strictly atheist, which I take to be defined as the position that there are no deities, we see that there is also a required belief that not not P implies P.


This is a little confusing with so many negatives.  But I hope it is interesting to you.

If anyone with a better understanding of these logical systems would like to critique what I've written above, I would more than appreciate it.  I admit I have a very rough understanding of formal mathematical logic, and I am always trying to expand my knowledge.

I have been thinking about the classic argument between atheists and agnostics on the definition of atheism and agnosticism. I sympathize with both and I'm not even sure how to properly define them, as to how they apply to those who hold no stance in regards to belief.

I am an atheist myself and I think there is common ground where both atheists and agnostics acknowledge that gnosticism and agnosticism deal with knowledge only and not belief. But agnostics get rustled when an atheist claims that agnostics are atheists too and I completely understand why. At one point in time in my search for answers I held no stance in any direction. I simply did not know and was searching for answers and the best way I knew to describe it would be ""agnosticism"" but it didn't feel like a complete description to me. Sure, I lacked knowledge either way but I also was completely neutral in regards to belief. I neither believed nor disbelieved.

Both atheists and agnostics can be a bit stubborn when it comes to this. I think there needs to be an extra term that agnostics go by because you can be a theist or an atheist and an agnostic at the same time. While atheists like to widen their definition to include those who lack belief (as opposed to active disbelief), agnostics also like to widen the definition of agnostic to those who hold no belief either way. There is an overlapping gray area here and I think a mutual understanding needs to take place.

So while the traditional ""atheist definitions"" look something like this:

               Theist
                  |
                  |
Agnostic --------- Gnostic

                  |
                  |
              Atheist


I think there needs to be some term added on that is completely neutral in regards to any of these stances. Because if theism is the assertion that there is a god, then naturally atheism is the opposite, the assertion that there is no god. This should not in my opinion include those who make no assertion (e.g. lack of belief in a god/s), which is what ""agnostics"" are. Because if gnosticism is the assertion that you know, agnosticism is the assertion that you don't know. While the latter holds true for people of this subreddit there is also a neutral aspect here where people do not make a stance one way or another, because of their agnosticism. So instead of including lack of belief in the definition of atheism, I think there needs to be another term that describes the lack of belief. If you can be an agnostic theist, or an agnostic atheist, then you can be an agnostic something or another, which would describe someone completely neutral in regards to belief.

The funny thing is, that's probably the essence of being agnostic, but it seems I have a natural urge to have a 'go to' ideology to rely on.

The issue is, how to deal with anti-theists and their 'spotless' arguments about rational thought and science.

I believe that science and anything related is a very small slice of 'reality.' I like to divide it up into three general sections. Religion, philosophy and science.

There are a magnitude of subjects which are not/will never be explained or researched by science. It simply isn't designed for some things.

What of the subjective reality? Science is by definition focused on objectivity, yet the whole of any individual's subjective reality may contain central information about the nature of reality.

According to philosophy--and possibly common sense--'knowing,' especially for *certain* is simply not possible.

And the biggest issue is that I'm a theist.

Having to defend myself from accusations of basically 'not believing in evidence and thus believing whatever I feel like' is a pain. I have no trouble with logic, rational thought, avoiding bias and fallacy, I believe in the virtue of science and I use science in my day to day life.

But how do I relate to people what my actual position is? Does anyone have any nice non-woowoo concepts about uncertainty, the value of subjectivity, the idea that just because something is non-true doesn't mean that it is not worth considering--

for instance, I have no trouble listening to someone saying something extremely outlandish, like 'extraterrestrials have buried iron in the ground 50,000 years ago so that humans would develop technology' (just a random example) and then, even though I disagree with the premise, I can extract valuable information from the rest of the argument.

Basically, I don't agree that just because something is not true, doesn't mean it does not apply to reality.

I don't know, perhaps my way of thinking actually *is* nuts, but I find that there is more to 'it' than that. Than objectivity. And I have an urge to communicate these concepts, but I feel a bit 'untethered' when trying to explain (although it makes sense that I would feel untethered when I view reality as a bit ambiguous.)

Can anyone relate with these sentiments? Any advice or assistance in my own clarity of thinking?",,False,,t5_2qjrd,False,,,True,t3_1j816q,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1j816q/the_nature_of_reality/,

Recently, I started going back to college and the Bible classes (Christian college), Biology, and World Civilizations (including historical religions) has slowly shown me that the beliefs I was raised with are wrong. The problem is I'm married to a fundamentalist and have a child with her. I want my child to grow up making up her own mind about religion, not be indoctrinated like I was. Also, I'm worried about what people will think, honestly. I tried to explain what I had learned about evolution once and how it might be plausible and I got some crazy looks as well as arguments about not finding a missing link as well as a world wide flood line.

This wouldn't be the first family-outing in a church, tho. I did go with her to her cousin's wedding last summer-ish, but there were a few of us who didn't go up for bread-n-juice (communion, I believe it's called).

A wedding is an incredibly common ceremony, regardless of religion. However, I see baptism as deep in Catholicism.

Here is a few tips..

1:Examine your current beliefs. No matter what you previously believed. Read Your scripture from cover to cover (If you already have done this sorry, you can skip this step. Don't mean to generalize anyone)

2 Consider your ethics and try to understand where they come from.. 
You may want to read books by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Carl Sagan They are all associated with atheism. 

3 Study various forms of theism. It is important to thoroughly understand your former faith and its tenets as well as those of other faiths. The more versed you are in other religions and the more you understand why people believe what they do, the better basis you'll have for your worldview. 

You may want to read books by Joseph Campbell and Karen Armstrong.
My personal favourites is The Power of Myth and The Hero with a thousand faces...

Might include Jainism, Stoicism, Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, or the Bhakti movement.

&gt;Nathan Katz in *Buddhist and Western Philosophy* (1981, p. 446) points out that the term ""transpolytheistic"" would be more accurate, since it entails that the polytheistic gods are not denied or rejected even after the development of a notion of ""the Absolute"" that transcends them

&gt;Paul Tillich uses ""transtheistic"" in *The Courage to Be* (1952), as an aspect of Stoicism. Tillich stated that Stoicism and Neo-Stoicism -

&gt;""are the way in which some of the noblest figures in later antiquity and their followers in modern times have answered the problem of existence and conquered the anxieties of fate and death. Stoicism in this sense is a basic religious attitude, whether it appears in theistic, atheistic, or transtheistic forms.""

&gt;Martin Buber criticized Tillich's ""transtheistic position"" as a reduction of God to the impersonal ""necessary being"" of Thomas Aquinas.

Is that a good thing?,Weareoysters,3,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1kd4no/scientists_are_the_artisans_of_today_is_that_a/,"I found an [article](http://www.pomona.edu/news/2004/07/07-link-artisans-science.aspx) about a book that apparently links Artisans to Scientists.  In this summary, they briefly describe how Artisans (i.e. carpenters, goldsmiths, painters, etc.) where sought out by early scientists because of their knowledge, experience, and skill working with these materials.  


This reminded me of an observation that Socrates made in [‘The Apology’](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html).  In his search for a wise man, Socrates goes to many different people.  He starts with the politician and the poet and realizes that they both know nothing and don’t even know that they know nothing.  He then goes to the Artisans.  Socrates acknowledges that the Artisans certainly have a wisdom that he does not have.  They know their own craft very well.  However, he soon realizes that the Artisans think that they know much more than they actually do.  The Artisans thought that because they were good at their craft, that they also were knowledgeable of much higher things.  Socrates concluded that this slaw overshadowed any wisdom they may have had.  


So are scientists the Artisans of today?  People like Dawkins and Hawking may be brilliant scientists.  However, their brilliance in their respective fields does not make them brilliant or even knowledgeable in all fields.  It doesn’t mean that they can’t be, but there should be a clear separation of between the different subjects they speak of.  Just because someone is a brilliant scientist does not mean that they automatically have the answers to questions on things like god or morality.  There is no doubt that science and scientists have contributed immensely to humanity as a whole.  But they and everyone else (whether they are musicians, journalists or politicians) should learn to stay in their lane.

Over the past couple of days/months I have seen both christian and atheist posts on social networks concerning disasters, most recently the boston bombings.  After some contemplation, and following the death of my grandfather, I offer a thought on a possible reality.

  What happens when our loved ones die?  I mean our truly, loved ones.  We mourn.  We grow sad because of their death.  We remember them, and who they were at their best in life.  In addition, we learn to appreciate them more in death (we don't appreciate the fact that they are dead, but we appreciate what they were before they were dead even more).  Eventually, we begin to appreciate those around us who are alive, that much more.

  This is my meditation:  what if God takes away the ones we love, so we may love what we have that much war?  He does not take the ones we love, and those that we know, so you follow his bible or pray to him more.  He does it so you can do the exact opposite.  He provides insentive to cherish your family, friends, enemies, accomplishments, senses, emotions, pain, and glorious life you have, before coming back to him.  We have become such an ugly society, enveloped by conflict, corruption, restrictions, condemnations, and ignorance.  He does not punish us for our sins, but encourages us to cherish.  

  Some may say from my above statement, God is a little malevolent.  I don't believe he is...but I don't believe he is benevolent or all-knowing either.  I believe he has the mind of a human (""we were created in his image"" [i still believe in evolution, just used the quote]), but the reasoning of an alien.  He believes this solution will saves us.

  Any thoughts?  I'd love to debate further on this.  Please no hate-commenting.

The universe as we know it is finite and all of its particles will eventually evaporate into nothing. If a universe like ours can come into existence then it is not too far of a stretch to imagine that, given an infinitude of time, another universe will come about. The most important thing to realize is that finite universes only have a finite number of possible outcomes. The evolution of the particles in a universe is like flipping a bunch of coins over and over again until it ends. If universes start and end over and over again for an infinitude of time then sooner or later the same sequence of particle evolution, or coin tosses, will repeat. We will probably live again exactly as we are living now. Also, We will also live again in an infinite number of other ways. It doesn't matter if there is any continuity or memory of our existences. Things will happen just the same. This idea is based on my most current and best understanding of our physical reality (universe, if you will). If one has good reason to believe that there is more to our current existence it may alter the way you choose to live your life. It comes down to if you believe there is an end to the occurrence of physical events or not.

First of all, I like to think of myself as a free thinker, and while i agree with atheism on a lot of things, I also believe that ANYTHING is possible. So as much disbelief i hold for the bible and Christianity as well as all other religions, i always keep that .000001 percent chance door open that it might be true. This universe is vast and immeasurable, and saying that something is impossible is just stupid to me. While I'm 99.9999 percent sure that there is no god, I'm still open to the possibility of it being true. I believe in maintaining that open-mindedness  because if I don't, I'm just as bad those close minded religious freaks who only see the world their way and everything else is just bullshit. This doesn't mean YOU Have to maintain this open-mindedness because another of my core beliefs is that EVERYONE is entitled to their opinion! Who am I to change YOUR belief? Who am I to say YOU'RE wrong? Thats why I don't tell my girlfriend to not believe in god, that's why i don't even tell my parents i don't believe in god. I know so little in this universe, I cant tell you you're wrong about something!! Your guess is as good as mine. I was raised christian but through logical thinking i discovered the most absolute truth. I DON'T KNOW. 
TLDR I'm agnostic. 

Now, while i respect everyone's beliefs and faiths, i do not respect organized religion. For a lot of reasons. The one i wanted to talk about though was the concept of intrinsic/extrinsic motivation. I believe that morality for the sake of religion is wrong. Say there is a god. Say he is this perfect being. And say there is a heaven that he brings people to. And say a spot opened up in heaven and hes trying to decide between two people. A fundamental christian ...and good ol me. (: Do you think hes going to take the one who has been doing good things for people just to get into heaven? Or do you think hes going to take me, who does good things for people just for the sake of helping another human being. For caring. 
Extrinsic vs Intrinsic. If there really is a god, and he really is perfect, I personally believe he'd take the latter. ",,False,,t5_2qjrd,True,,,True,t3_tg5f9,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/tg5f9/intrinsic_vs_extrinsic/,

The reason I am not atheist yet is because (1) I LOVE the idea of a God (2) I really don't see any conflicts between science and the bible. (I have come up with a multitude of thoughts and theories in my mind that I am not ready to share with the world yet)

**ANYWAY** argument is not on whether there is a God or not.. It's the fact that despite my eager naive mind, I feel weak in the knees to know that this God that I used to pray to all the time and really have become a real friend to, actually may not be there. He says ""those who seek shall find"" and I will stay agnostic my whole life if that is what it takes as I cannot deny my deep wanting for there to be a pure character above our universe who is the ultimatum that we can turn to in distress, someone who will love us unconditionally. However, until I know my prayers are being heard and I get some vision, or several radical prayers are answered, i will stay at the end of the road, hoping for an extension of it to be discovered.

Anyway, I just like to listen to a band called ""Owl City"". He has such unique lyrics that really anyone can relate to for almost anything. Although I haven't found assurance in a God yet, I find assurance [through Owl City] that wherever I am, I can always sink into my agnosticism, a middle point where untruth and truth are balanced finely, waiting for one side or the other to tip. I find comfort in this stasis.

Anyhow, some of his songs I like to listen to with the thought of a hoping willingness that God exists are:

[Dementia by Owl City](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQrnUgiephw)

[Vanilla Twilight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIz2K3ArrWk)

[Angels (this one is good)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d4Kj2u4VN8)

That's it. People say ""the truth will set you free"". Well, I know I **may** be absolutely delusional for saying this, but I don't care!: ""Only God can set me free, and if a God is not among me, than will this dirty world let me fall asleep into a dream forever where there is a God among me""

Anyway, maybe I will submit my theories some day and blow all of your minds, or maybe I am crazy after all and really should find a way to fall into a dream forever...

To try and explain my views I'm going to use Reddit as an analogy. Nobody knows how Reddit was created, sure there was an idea of what it was going to be, but nobody can explain the sudden inspiration of this idea. That's our view on the world, you may believe it was a higher power, or a scientific theory on how it was created., but as it stands we do not know how the world came into being. I mean if it was God, why did he suddenly come up and decide to create the universe?

Reddit grows, it becomes more popular, a larger community, and begins to improve itself. Just as we humans have, growing brinGing the world to what it is now with advances in science, medicine etc.

The majority of the world are good human beings, and live their life such, but of course your going to get idiots in all walks of life, and such is the case with reddit. Most people will browse the site, provide funny and insghtful comments, but your also going to get people who lie on Reddit and spread hate and force their views upon people.

This is how I see the world, most of us a decent people, but you know there will be people for whatever reason, decide that being an asshole is the way to go.

Then we get to Reddit's karma system. A user posts something, and gets upvotes and downvotes.

In comparision the the real world, we'll use the example of giving blood. You give blood and most people will appreciate this act, but you will also get people who won't, or people who believe it's wrong.

This leads me to my final point, I am avid believer in karma, I believe if you do good things for people, regardless if you know them or not, you will have the same happen to you. Doing this provides that feeling, that feeling you cannot describe where you have performed a selfless act, whether it be paying for a strangers coffee, or providing an organ for a complete stranger. It is this feeling, which is religion, god, a higher power. It is this feeling of and act you have performed that you cannot describe to anyone, but feels amazing, and there is a reason why it feels good, why it makes us happy, and there is a reason why we feel like crap when we hurt someone, or done something stupid.

This is why I believe we are here, however we were created and by who, we have this built into our human nature, to do well and help others, whether it be family, friends or strangers. This is why I believe there is higher power out there, for whatever reason he created he, he installed this basic into our human nature. and providing this amazing feeling, when performing these selfless acts. It is of course down to your free will, if we choose to act upon this.

Going back to the analogy of Reddit; you post something, whether it be picture of your cat, or discussion provoking comment. You didn't have to do that, you didn't have to post, yet you you did, to share what you have with complete strangers, and as you see the upvotes and replies, you think to yourself, that feels good, and someone else out there is feeling the same way because of you.",,False,,t5_2qjrd,False,,,True,t3_1jy58w,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/1jy58w/how_i_view_life_being_agnostic/,

Anyway! The reason why I don't identify with atheism, is because I'm an equal opportunity lover. I think as a more holistic agnostic, one can tread this line without being two-faced. All widely accepted religions have a good message when viewing them from a holistic approach.

Personally, I think agnosticism and atheism are incompatible despite the fact that much of the /r/atheist sub likes to label themselves agnostic-atheists. This simply isn't the case. As an agnostic, we know that finding proof for god is just about impossible, but we accept it as a possibility. Whereas atheism has rejected the idea until it is proved otherwise.

At these times people stop relying on memories and create them, something that those who follow someone else often miss out on. It is then that we leave our cave and forage.

Get opposite sides of an opinion for somewhere in the middle lies the truth. Don't race to to red lights. Learn about a few religions but don't blindly follow. Go to a service and see a rock show. Take what you think is useful and apply it. Always look over your shoulder before switching lanes. Trust and love yourself and love others too. Never let someone else's thoughts be superimposed onto your own subconsciously. Recognize someone in distress ad to your best to help but know when enough is enough.

I do not believe that religion should be ingrained with the state, but that there are principles in every religion from Christianity to Buddhism on how to set laws and deal with justice.

**IMMIGRATION** 
I find myself as a strong advocate against amnesty for illegal immigrants on the grounds of safety and justice. Those who worked hard to prove that they want to be a part of the U.S. system should not be sold short just because we have a lot of illegal immigrants. This is not to say that because you are an illegal immigrant you don't deserve to become a citizen.

**WAR**
I believe in the war against al-qaeda, but I also believe we should avoid what got us in that situation in the first place. Interventionism and costly alliances with NATO and Israel.

I believe that the big bang was a unique event, at least ""for us"" contained within this universe. Why do i believe the big bang is a unique event? 

Because if I am to go along with science, then I believe in the 2nd law of thermodynamics and that this universe will end in a ""permanent"" state of heat death since entropy does not reverse itself.

If the universe had cycles, we are certainly in the last iteration where the 2nd law holds true. There could have been other universes before ours made out of the same plasma, but based on the initial conditions of expansion, the 2nd law wasn't true.

Also I believe that our notion of causality or ""Kalām cosmological argument"" for the ""First cause"" which goes 

1. Everything that has a beginning of its existence has a cause of its existence;
2. The universe has a beginning of its existence;
3. Therefore: The universe has a cause of its existence.

Not crazy right? Totally in line with scientific reasoning. Next step, the ontological argument for creation (I dont know if I could call this a ""God""), but with proof. Current testing of for cosmic background radiation Multi-verse theory about our universe as a microscale bubble in some other macroscale origin is also compatible with our experiences. 

By 2013 we will be able to know alot more about the possibility of intersections between our universe and other universes if they exist based on CMB studies through Planck satellite data.  see [this](http://fqxi.org/community/articles/display/155) 

I really do believe we aren't special, and that our universe itself is not special either. There is no reason to believe our universe is singular, and that there aren't others like it out there. In fact the multiverse was considered ridiculous because it was not popper falsifiable, but Einstein's cosmological constant was also considered ""shaky"" until we realized he was using an abstract placeholder but then bam in 1998 we discovered our universe was expanding and just like that, another instance of positive assertions of things we didn't have the knowledge for are testable. This is why I don't feel I am agnostic, because I feel you CAN make positive assertions that you DONT have the means to test for, in fact, science is precisely based on hypothesis and looking for positive confirmations, not falsifications of arbitrary statements.

I posted this in [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) because I didn't know this subreddit exists. I didn't realize when I posted that [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) tends to ""pounce"" on agnostics that wonder in. My intention isn't to insult any of you, though I may inadvertently do so. So anyway, here is my cross-post:

This isn't intended to offend, but it may offend some people.

I've just never understood the need for the existence of agnosticism. I was raised in the midwest and I was a Christian until 19, when I realized that I no longer believed. My sister-in-law and I jokingly refer to it as 'pussy agnostic' - the implication being that those who identify as agnostic are simply atheists that are afraid to fully turn away from whatever god they once believed in, or for some other reason don't want to identify as an atheist (like perhaps the stigma attached the the word).

So, with that little intro, I suppose I'll talk about some of the reasons that I don't understand agnosticism.

Firstly, yes, none of us can know that there isn't a god. But there's no reason (insofar as I can tell) to treat the likelihood of a god's existence as equally to the likelihood of its nonexistence. There is an endless amount of things that we can't *know* don't exist (Flying Spaghetti Monster, anyone?). Why is a god so different from Flying Spaghetti Monster?

If you've declared yourself agnostic, then you have (presumably using basic logic and reasoning) figured out that there's a good chance that there is no god. Why then, wouldn't that same logic lead you to see that it is overwhelmingly unlikely that there is no god, and as such, there is no reason to hold out some belief that he could exist.

I'm hoping some agnostic redditors can refute some of these points using the logic and reason that we all love so much!

Additionally, I'd like to add this part: why do so many people hate r/atheism so much? I've never understood this. I mean, what did you expect? The only thing that we *know* we all have in common is that we don't believe in the existence of any deities... what the hell else would we post about? I'm also subscribed to r/nfl, and goddammit all they post about is football!

Now, this raised a question: what is the point? 

I've asked some people on /r/atheism about this, and they say that they are in their own right to bash other religions as they bash atheism. In my opinion, this seems fair enough. I must agree that sometimes it is true that they over do it and post more anti-theist posts than atheism **""related""** posts. (In parenthesis because sometimes they are the same thing). However, it is normal for a group to circle jerk all the time, especially when it's one of the largest atheist hubs on the internet.

Just understand that, like Christianity or any other religion, there are going to be varying degrees of ""belief"" and these are usually affected under the circumstances which one is surrounded

Penn Jillette once said that ""In the end of the 19th century... Catholics were terrified of Baptists, Baptists were terrified of Evangelicals, the whole list"" It wasn't until the mid to late 60's that this blanket term of ""Christian"" rose up in order to unite all ""Christians"" against abortion in the anti-abortion debates. Before this, the ""Accepted religion"" for a lack of a better term, was Protestant. However, some very ""Clever"" people (I don't want to use the word ""Genius"" or ""Smart"", because they did not contribute to humanity, and if anything, they made it worse) decided that they could not fight abortion if all these different Christian sects were fighting each other about how to fight abortion. They all decided that they needed a blanket term that included, and united, everybody against a common enemy idea. Consequently, they all got extreme political influence. That is why, almost every Political candidate, with the exception of some, was able to avoid all questions about his or her faith, simply by saying they are Christian. That is why, people like Michelle Buchman and Rick Santorum are able to say all this hateful, bat-S@#t crazy things, and still not lose support. Unfortunately, that is not the case with Atheists and Agnostics and people who don't want to commit to an organized religion. Inside the non-religious base, we are all fighting about who does NOT believe in religion more than the other, instead of uniting against what we all call our ""enemy"": Illogical, crazy, and horse-sh#t ideas that cause a great amount of anti-intellectualism in societies around the world. And through fighting each other, we keep losing political and social influence, while the ""Religious"" base keeps gaining it. That is why I propose that we nonbelievers do what the Christians did.

I've been very curious about voodoos that are made by shamans, tabibs, or dukuns (as it is called in my country, Indonesia). Some people (many people, I think) think of voodoos as a scam activity, where they take booze/drugs and go into a state of trance and heals you and cures your problems, or that's maybe what they make you think (placebo effect)

However, aside from the healing activities, they can also be paid to supernaturally hurt a designated target by 'inserting' needles and/or other stinging stuffs inside the body, usually near the intestines, vital organs, and the throat - which is called a witchcraft, I think (it's locally known as 'santet).

At first I don't believe this is true, and that it's just another made up by the media for entertainment purposes; film materials. But after reading several magazines, reading forums, and talking to several elders that has the 'gift', I started to believe that this isn't a mere lie.

1352008648.0,0,self.agnostic,12lolz,Through Buddhism I have finally realized the Judeo-Christian God and where our society has lost Him. (x-post),gigglefarting,3,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/12lolz/through_buddhism_i_have_finally_realized_the/,"Just a little bit of my background. I was raised Jewish, and by that I mean I was bar mitzvahed, and I call myself Jewish (can't hide or deny this curly fro), but I've considered myself agnostic since middle school. My interest in Buddhism started in college while taking a religions class, and has inspired me to read a few books. I am no scholar or expert in either religion by any means, but I do consider myself a Jubu. Buddhism has opened my eyes, and the book The Power of Now has helped me attach the label.

So now onto this God guy and where the problem is with him and our society...

The crux of the problem is the fact that God is seen as a super natural being. But the word God is just a label, and it's trying to label the label-less. The world before the world of opposites, and as soon as you attach a label to it, it takes on properties that might not necessarily define it. And this label has transformed through the ages to take on properties of the super natural. It's not super natural. It's super nature. All of nature. Everything that exists in the universe and the nothingness that's, well... nothing. Through philosophy class I was able to attach the basic properties of the Judeo-Christian God: omniscience, omnipotent, and omni-benevolence. But at the same time, we're quick to say that there's some OTHER, super natural, being with these properties. However, I've become aware that these are all attributes that can describe ourselves and nature if we drop our ego/mind and allow nature to happen.

Omniscience - People say that God knows everything. He has all the answers. He knows what I'm going to do tomorrow. But I'm starting to think that we shouldn't be looking at it as if you know all the answers to everything already, even answers to questions that haven't been asked yet. I think we can also view omniscience as not necessarily having all the answers, but having no questions to be answered. When you need nothing answered, then you already know everything. In a meditative state you don't ask, ""why is that tree there?"" You only observe the tree with complete awareness and accept it as is. Complete acceptance transcends you past a state of questioning. The mind asks the questions, but the body already knows everything it needs to know.

Omnipotent - If we can get past the concept that God is a super natural being, then we can realize that omnipotence doesn't need to include super natural powers. Everything that has happened, is happening, and will ever happen happens in nature. Men are part of nature, so even things we do and create are created in nature. Like I said before, God is not some super natural being that's external from our world. He's not a guy with super powers that is here to save the day for you. He is the all encompassing, so when you take away the super natural properties it only makes sense that nature has the full power of nature.

Omni-benevolence - God is all good and all loving. People's natural state is all good and all loving. True, people generally aren't all good and all loving in our society, but that's because people in our society are very ego driven. Being ego driven doesn't mean it will make you do bad things, but it does separate you from everything else. Your ego can drive you to give to charity, but the ego is what wants to take credit for giving to charity. Selfless acts aren't ego driven, and that should be obvious since it's right there in the word itself ""self less."" When you sit and lose your ego, only becoming aware of everything around you, you'll learn that the void your ego leaves is filled with love and compassion. There has been brain scans on meditating monks that has given scientific proof of this concept. It is within all of us to tap this power, but it does require dropping the ego. But once you drop the ego this power fills up everything. We are omni-benevolent if we allow ourselves to be, and our capacity for omni-benevolence shouldn't seem contradictory at all. Why shouldn't I be able to love all things?

To feel the presence of God is to feel the presence of everything and the presence of self. To be completely aware of nature. And this can only be felt in the present. Only right now you can drop your self and become all knowing (or should I say no longer questioning) and all good, and only when you drop your ego can you accomplish what you want to accomplish the way it needs to be accomplished. To do from the heart rather than from the mind.

There are 2 questions I remember from philosophy class that have been used to prove the inexistence of God:

1) ""Can God create a rock so big that even he can't lift?"" and
2) ""If God exists, then why is there suffering in the world?""

To answer the first question. If we realize that it is not something super natural but all of nature the question then becomes illogical. It's assuming that there is something OTHER than the lifter and the lifted. If there is an other force it is the nothingness or just pure consciousness that connects us all, and all rocks, all of everything, does exist, and it will unexist, and the rock would not be anything different than everything that already is. Hell, planets are big rocks, and what's holding those up?

As to the second question, Buddha has taught us that suffering exists in our mind and that our ego creates this suffering. So when we say, ""why is there suffering in the world?"" what is it that we mean by suffering? Do we mean physical pain, or something else? If it's physical pain then pain is also part of nature, and you can't attribute the labels ""good"" or ""bad"" to pain. Sometimes it's a defense mechanism and saves our lives. The point is is that it exists, and because of this it's part of God as it's a part of all of us. Some people even enjoy this physical sensation and it's not ""suffering"" at all. Now we can attribute suffering to what the Buddha was getting at and it's this desire that things aren't as they are. So suffering exists because our ego gets in the way between our body and what is God. Pain is not suffering. Pain is God. It is the ego/mind that suffers. The reason why there is suffering in the world is because we choose to suffer and not choose to feel everything as is.

But once you realize all this, I feel like there's no more need for the label of ""God"" because the existence of God lives in a world without labels. Labels are a mind created thing. Whether you call it God or the Tao is to miss the point. It doesn't matter because it's all the same, and we're all the same.
The God that our society views is nothing more than a manifestation of people's egos. People take all of their fears, desires and uncertainties that their ego has created and hope that something out THERE has all the powers and answers. But what's even worse is that people don't realize that their ""God"" is all of this, so then try to push it onto other people, which is only pushing their own ego, their own fears and desires, onto others. People have asked me quite often if I'm afraid to go to Hell? And I can only laugh because I choose not to believe in such a place. If anything, Hell is the mind/ego, and Heaven is the body. Why do people want to wait till they die to live in bliss and peace when we all have that ability to do so right now on this planet.

The weird thing is, once I've unattached the label you can see existence under all the different labels. At one point you lose religion but find all religions. It's all pointing to the same thing, but our egos have driven it to so many different divisions. Not only is there Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, etc.. But inside each main category there's different sects as well. But the weird part is that those are all monotheistic religions, (with the possible exception of Buddhism, but to say that is to attach a label to it) so it all must be rooted to the same thing. And once you can let go of the label that takes you away from this root, you can see where the root sprouts and understand. By dropping one religion you can gain a concept of all religions. Then organized religions just become a set of laws.

**Gnostic/Agnostic** - The extent to which one claims knowledge.

To call oneself ""Agnostic"" is meaningless.  Unless you literally mean that there is not a single modicum of knowledge contained in your brain.  

Why has the Agnostic/Atheist distinction persisted?  Everyone here knows that most people who use the term ""Atheist"" to describe themselves are technically agnostic atheists; what other reasonable position is there?

Two categories with two options each gives four possible classifications:

-Agnostic Atheist

-Gnostic Atheist

-Agnostic Theist

-Gnostic Theist

The fact is that the bulk of people fit into either the agnostic atheist category or gnostic theist category.  Gnostic atheists, were you to explain the difference between disproof and lack of evidence, would be (and are) few and far between.  Agnostic theists.... well what they hell are they anyway?  Assuming knowledge is the basis of belief (in other words - the person is even remotely intelligent) then how could you be a theist without claiming knowledge?  

Please, even most educated theists know what someone means when talking about atheism - this smug ""I'm agnostic because I'm not arrogant enough to say that there is no God"" crap is becoming tiring, mostly because the premise is false.  All of you are agnostic atheists, and so are the majority of r/atheism folks.

I have been agnostic from my first conscious thoughts of ''Next time around...'' My parents took us to church as children and early on I found ways to escape, for one: hiding in the art closet during Sunday school, to which I was informed ''They know where you are.'' Welp. I believed before I knew I believed- in reincarnation. Not in the manner of ''this is how it is and you're wrong if you don't agree,'' and therefore, not a religious belief, but knowing what I feel and understanding my truth. I have been before, and I will be again.
And I haven't had my beliefs challenged for a very long time, no one cared to discuss theirs or mine... Until recently. A new co-worker shared her Christianity with me in the form of her homophobia (but she has a gay dad! so she's not judging b/c she loves her dad the sinner, just not the sin). 
And then I brought this on myself- I accepted her fb request and proceeded to post the ''So you still think Homosexuality is Sinful?'' diagram. Her response, on my page- was the first time that someone actually upset me on fb.
I pulled up some verses to see where to begin... And oh my FSM, no wonder these people are so *angry* and *hateful*. They are being instructed to follow a contradictory doctrine that would confuse even the most feebly freethinking mind. 
I didn't find the term I was looking for from the article above, and I didn't want to overwhelm myself. I stuck to the topic of homosexuality. And I used verses I found just after the ""damn them all"" ...the verses that say ''Hey, I'll handle it sheep, I, God, will do the punishing, and the forgiving!'' I added to that the typical ''Shall not kill'' and ended with:
There are many contradictory ideals put forth. Thou shall not kill. Kill gays, I already punished gays, I forgive gays. Let those who are free of sin cast the first stone. 
I have been irritated, amused, and enlightened by this endeavour, I had been intending to ""read the bible"" and educate myself on Religion for some time. This has been a good start.
And- thank you reddit, for these forums, I was truly ignorant to how prevalent the argument of ""God says he is God so he is God, and you are wrong not to believe him,"" was. Maddening.

And I find myself using the same arguments to refute them that I use against theists. I used to think that they were fellow travellers, just a slightly less certain version of atheists. No more. I now put you squarely in the camp of the theists. I now see you as part of the problem. 

Edit: After further conversation I am even more convinced of the above and add the following:

The only way an agnostic can defend his position that God cannot be proved either way is by defending the idea of God. And he is left with the same arguments as the theist. First cause and ""god of the gaps"".

It is the agnostics in this sub who have proved the above with their posts.

Furthermore - you are all mystics. You seem to believe that human consciousness is much more than just the result of evolutionary biology. You seem to think that our higher moral reasoning is an example of something beyond science and beyond explanation, as if consciousness is something whose source is outside ourselves.

Furthermore you denigrate science as some minor and very imperfect bias and imply that there are many more and superior methods of viewing the universe yet fail to come up with a single example.
