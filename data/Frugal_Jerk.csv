It's yesterday: a typical Thursday night.  I'm soaking lentils for today, pausing every so often to m-turk and make sure the torrents I have going on my neighbor's 'net connection are downloading properly.

I'm constantly explaining to my girlfriend about the frugality of multitasking for enhanced productivity (I send her a slew of links to life-hacking type blog posts -- typically a handful each day) but she is just sitting on a couch cushion on the floor (I sold off my furniture and acquired old couch cushions from Freecycle, [tip of the hat to you guys for the advice]), wasting time and money, sucking air and taking up valuable space in the small basement room that I've been squatting in for the past 3 years.

She starts to cry.  I think about saving her tears to season the lentils so I wouldn't have to waste my valuable salt (I know, fatcat stuff, but I only use my salt for special occasions.)  I ask why she's crying.  She says that it's her ""birthday"".  I look it up on Wikipedia, and, indeed, it's some kind of special day celebrated by the wealthy -- another excuse to throw money around and behave like a buffoon.

I try to curb my tongue, but all I feel like doing is telling her what a wasteful pig she is.  She wants me to take her out for ""drinks"" and ""cake"" -- I'm thinking: how did I get myself into this mess?

What should I do guys?  Should I indulge her?  I'm thinking about compromising and letting her use my special salt shaker on her lentils, or even (and trust me, I'm wincing here too) going out and buying an ""Italian Mix"" spice blend that I saw at a local dollar store.  She's Italian so I figured she'll really like it, and, hey, everyone splurges once in a while.    

So, guys, what should I do here?  What's the right move?",,False,self,t5_2vdcr,False,,,True,t3_1ezfg2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal_Jerk/comments/1ezfg2/relationship_advice_are_we_too_different_help/,

Most of the jokes I see on this subreddit are often on the nose with how they targets bizarre money saving strategies like ironing gift tissue paper, or milk bottle watering cans (when more appropriate tools are available for $4 at any landscape supply).

However, there is a category or two of frugalite that often escapes notice. They're easy to spot too, so I don't know how we missed them beyond ~~not being able to afford~~ refusing to buy glasses. I'll break them down here.

* Rich kids: We're starting to pick up on this one thanks to a recent /r/frugal post. This offender has lived a blessed life, and is usually oblivious to their own privilege. They often make exaggerated claims about how little they spend, shortly before you learn that their parents pay for rent, utilities, cell phone, and their luxury car payment. They extoll the virtues of their ascetic lifestyle which is completely subsidized by their parents. If untreated, they risk growing up into.

* Wi-Fi Stealing Millionaire, AKA Scrooge McDuck: This, I think is the most compelling category, yet most untouched. I think because it's difficult character to play. A rich person who is convinced they're poor. It's also hard to call them out since we don't know all of their situation, but they show up if you know where to look. Scroll to the bottom of any thread on cutting utility costs and there they are. From a lead engineer who turns off his fridge at night (saves about a dollar a year), to the renter in a 400 sq ft studio who roasts in his 90F deg apartment so they can save $20 a month despite potential health risks. These are people who clearly have means, but prefer to suffer in exchange for very very little.

* The Craftsman: Akin to the WiFi Stealing Millionaire, you have this handy sod who will toil away for hours making soap to keep from having to buy it from the dollar general. When not dabbling in amateur chemistry, they are working hard to turn trash into something that is slightly less trash, but still trash. The milk jug turned into a lousy watering can comes to mind. Not understanding efficiency, they don't realize that most products are made for us so we can worry about other things, like spending time with friends or family. 

* The Fraudster: This one shows up once in a while, but is personally rage inducing. Borderline sociopathic, this person not only commits and promotes small-scale fraud, they are obstinate in their defense of it. These show up in uncomfortable threads about ""worst thing you've ever done for frugality"" or the like. A great example is the meat packaging thread we had a week or two ago. These people bring in coupons from other stores, and then throw a fit when policy doesn't let them return the hammer they bought at Lowes at Home Depot. They put hair on their food to avoid paying the bill. A thousand little sins to avoid paying, and then blame the establishment for trying to take their money for a service or product.

* Captain No Friends: This one's easy. They offer sweeping, unhelpful advice while making enormous judgments about your lifestyle. TV? Chuck it. Car? Sell it. No public transit? Go move to a city with public transit. Happy hour? Drink at home, alone. Movies? Theater's too expensive and I already threw out my TV. Often a case of ""STOP LIKING WHAT I DON'T LIKE"", they have no idea about you or your values, but are only happy to tell you about how they're ruining your life. Granted many people have bad habits, but often the advice is made regardless of the individual's specific circumstances.

I'm open to other ideas, but I think that we need more than simply lentil gardeners protecting their refrigerator box forts. I love the one-upsmanship that exists her (like in so much of /r/frugal), but there's so much more that annoys me about that subreddit than we've even begun to touch on.

Let's step up our game.

It's probably the least frugal thing of all time.  But here's how you can do it for cheap.

First you need a friend who uses groupon a lot for dinner deals.  Invite him or her over to your cardboard box you're not paying rent on and show them a cool youtube video with the wifi you're leaching from Best Buy.  Email them the video and have them check their email to make sure they actually got it.  Say something like 'The wifi here is pretty bad.  Sometimes emails don't go through.  You would think an electronics store would be pretty on the ball with this.'

But here's the rub.  You've installed a keylogger on your seven year old laptop you found at the landfill's freecycling day.  So when they log in to their email, you have their name and password.  

Now all you need to do is check their email every two or three days.  If they get a groupon for a restaurant you're interested in, you just need to print it out and show up.  And since you pay for the groupon before going out, you can just order a water and extra bread for free.",,False,self,t5_2vdcr,False,,,True,t3_147cdw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal_Jerk/comments/147cdw/want_to_eat_out_on_the_cheap_some_preparation/,

**Starting a Lentil Farm**

The first thing you’re going to want to do is steal a handful of lentils. Bulk Barn is my store of choice. They’re usually understaffed and have no cameras. Choose brown or red lentils, as they’re smaller and you can grab more seeds in one shot.
 
Since true frugalists don’t own anything, it’s safe to assume you don’t have anywhere to sow your seeds. Thankfully, fat cat tax payers keep cemeteries in operation. A cemetery is a great place to plant lentils for two reasons: people walking by will think you’re planting flowers and the rotting cadavers add nutrients to the soil. Space the plants accordingly, preferably right over the graves for maximum plant food.

When the time comes, harvest your lentils and stash them in a casket to keep them cool and dry. Lentils are a cold-season crop, so you’ll have to wait until spring to grow another batch. For now, commit a petty crime that lands you in jail for the next six months. 


**Lentils as Currency**

When you get out of prison, it’s time to recruit some workers. Go to /r/frugal and create a job ad. Tell the potential recruits that payment will be in lentils. The true fugalists will go for it, realizing the opportunity they’ve been given.
 
As you can already see, growing lentils is basically the same as printing your own money. You now have skilled DIY laborers who are willing to work for lentils.


**The Help**

Split your crew into two groups: the first group will be construction. Get them to build you a shelter for the winter. The second group will be focused on growing more lentils.  

While the cemetery provides enough lentils for a small group, more is better. Send the second group into rich neighborhoods, looking for unkempt gardens. The owners of these gardens are obviously lazy and stupid. Get your frugalites to knock on the door and offer to pull the weeds for a small fee. Pull the weeds and secretly plant lentils in the garden. If the foolish owners ask about the plants your frugalites are leaving behind, tell them these are special herbs that keep pests away. Now you’ve got a lentil crop hiding in plain sight and real money! 

Now that you’ve got a shelter and an upcoming lentil crop, it’s time to solve another big issue: heating in the winter. Burning anything other than stolen firewood is a luxury we can’t afford so we have to look at alternatives. Fortunately, most cities have an abundance of homeless people, who provide body heat in the winter, free labor in the growing season, and meat when they perish.

To lure the homeless, there are two options. The first is to flash your weed-picking earnings as you walk by. This will make you look rich and homeless people regard the rich as their gods. The second option is to find an empty whiskey bottle and fill it with urine. Tell them you own a liquor store and you’re giving away all your booze. Once the homeless people have arrived at your shelter, start feeding them a steady diet of weeds from your picking operation and fermented lentils. Tell them frightening stories about the outside world, until they’re afraid to leave.

It’s now time to hunker down for the harsh winter. Get the homeless people to sleep in the inner perimeter of your shelter, as human insulation. Have your DIY frugalites sew blankets and sweaters out of human hair. If food becomes an issue, consider killing off and consuming the weakest members of your group, until balance is restored.


**Expanding Your Operation**

You should now be entering your third growing season. You’re living with a group of frugalites and homeless people, who will collectively be referred to as “the colony”. It’s time to acquire land and expand your lentil-growing operation.

Land can be acquired in one of three ways:

1.	The Fat Cat Method – contact a local real estate agency, see what’s for sale, and *pay for it*.

2.	The Frugal Method – get to know local growers, rent some land, and get into a crop rotation agreement.

3.	The Frugal_Jerk Method – find a suitable piece of land, murder the landowner, and have one of your frugalites assume the previous owner’s identity. This strategy comes with the added bonus of “inheriting” an estate. 

Next, the land must be prepared. Your homeless crew has subsisted on weeds, lentil wine, and the meat of their fallen comrades since the previous growing season, meaning they’re fit and ready for action. Have your DIY crew build a plow and use your homeless crew in place of oxen. 

At this point, it makes sense to stop planting lentils in people’s gardens. Reassign these frugalites to recruiting. Libraries and internet cafés provide access to the internet, free of charge. Have your frugalites brag on internet forums and blog posts about their no-spending lifestyle and how much better they are than regular people. Struggling frugalists will flock to your colony.

Your homeless crew will now be eating the weeds picked from your lentil fields. Depending on how clean the field has been kept in the past, there may not be enough to sustain your homeless crew. Try subsidizing their diet with small rodents, tree bark, and foraged roots.
 

**Reaching Fat Cat Status**

You’re now selling into the global lentil market. Lentil prices don’t matter, since your labor, land, and seed is free. With a 100% profit margin, you can now watch your fiscal rewards pile up. As long as the colony is fed a steady diet of lentils, rainwater, and fear of the outside world, you will continue to reap the benefits of your hard work and innovation.

At this point, you might notice that your lifestyle is beginning to change. You might get your DIY laborers to build you a 400sqft mansion.  Nightly raids of U-Pick farms could be replaced by daytime visits in which you actually pay for your food. Luxuries like rice and dried beans may become a staple in your diet. 

Of course, this type of runaway lifestyle can’t be sustained forever, so be sure to invest 99% of your earnings. The remaining 1% can be used to live the high-class lifestyle you’ve always dreamed of.

In my house, I had probably three or four containers that I had been keeping lined with these (money pits).^(0)  I had been searching online for bulk deals and shopping the clearance aisles of my local UFS^(1) and finally found 40,000 of the large black trash bags^(1b, caution, spoiler) for a great price.  These are much too large for the trash cans in my home so what I ended up doing was this: I punched a hole in each wall near my original trash cans and installed doggie doors at about waist height through which I could discard items piecewise into larger trash bins outside my house.  

However, I still didn't enjoy the fact that I had to pay up front almost $0.08 just to throw something away.  

The last time I changed my motor oil, I kept the old oil in a rain barrel outside my house.  The oil is light and mostly floats on top, which allows me to still get to the rainwater below (with a syphon) when I need to water my switchgrass lawn (grown for biofuel).  Yada yada. 

Well anyways what I end up doing is just skimming a bit of the oil off the top with a used coffee filter and then wiping it all over the insides of my four new exterior trash cans.  This allows the trash to slide right out into the curbside bin on trash day.  Now if this is where I had stopped, I would be plenty proud of this tip, and gladly pass it along to you.  But for *this* I had to make the time and come right here and tell my frugal reddit family.  

I take the trash out on Wednesday nights, and the trash man comes early on Thursday.  So what I do is this:  I tip the cans up on one corner.  Frugal minds think alike so you probably see where this is going.  I funnel the residual oil down into a corner of the trash can where I've fashioned a hole that I have stopped up with an old earplug I scavenged from my neighbor's dog's excrement.^(2)  Well, I set my alarm for 5:20 AM, go outside and see that nature, or in this case, gravity, has done its thing.  I remove the plug and let that corner oil trickle into an old glass mayonnaise jar can I inherited from my grandfather (the king of frugal btw).  Back into the barrel it goes and now I've been able to sustain on just the original deposit since I began harvesting about 8 months ago.^(3)

    (0) I have calculated that a savings of $0.40 per week nets me
    roughly $20 per year.  
    (1) Used Food Store
    (1b) I now use the remaining black trash bags as bargaining chips 
    at the UFS, garage sales, and swap meets.  
    (2) There's a small hole in his fence, which I'm able to snake 
    through, depending on my diet for the week.  Usually on 
    Wednesdays I am thinnest, but that's unrelated to this story.  I 
    saw that glimmer of neon yellow one foggy day in 2009 and
    waited until I was sure they are asleep.  They typically turn their
    house lights on in the evenings until they go to bed, so it is painfully
    obvious when they go to sleep.  As I'm sure many can relate, I 
    don't remember the last time I personally used an interior light.   
    (3)  Currently I have my car trained to require only one oil change
    approximately every 13 months or every 12,700 miles, whichever 
    comes last.

I see so many deer at night where I work that I could feed myself completely with venison all year IF I could stand butchering them. 

And cities usually have a problem with too many deer that they have to hire cops to cull them. So you arent hurting anything by poaching them. Deer dont belong in cities anyway. There are plenty of deer in the country.

Look, I want to fucking live alone and I want to live close to the fucking campus.  Is that so much to ask?  My mom and dad is paying for it.  So its free!!!!!!  They want to share the wealth, so WHY THE FUCK is he in my FUCKING BUSINESS.  I EAT LENTILS AND LENTILS FOR BREAKFAST, 2ND BREKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER AND FUCKING MIDNIGHT SNACKS.  I steal wifi from the library and I use asshole friend's netflix account.  I don't have a job but I'm getting good at stealing kitchen appliances and trading cards from WalMart and rich looking old people.  

What does he do?  He sits around on FUCKING reddit all day and eats doritos because he's friends with the FUCKING CEO.  YEP. COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT.  

Does he pay for gas in non-frugal ways? YEP. I SAVE GAS BY SIPHONING ASSHOLE FRIEND'S GAS INTO MY SCOOTER THAT I GOT FROM AN OLD LADY THAT DOESN'T NEED IT NOW.

Does he use a pillow made from my hair? Nope. I do.

Does he save money by blowing his nose on his shirt?  Nope. I do.

Does he eat lentils? Nope. I live Lentils.

Does he not shower? Nope. I do.

Does he have a 10 year supply of pumpkins? Nope. I do.

Does he add leftover semen that has nutritious flavorings such as fructose, sperm and citric acid to LENTILS? Nope. I d- Wait. No I don't either.

TELL ME HOW FRUGAL I AM AND WHAT AN ASSHOLE HE IS. Oh, and other suggestions would be great!

Because of this, it costs a few cents to flush your toilet, which over the course of a month can add up to a few dollars! Crazy, right?

So, you should be looking for every way possible to save money on toilet flushes. Up until now, I was simply not flushing my toilets ever. I'd just shovel my turds into a bucket and put them in my neighbor's yard. 

Only problem is, he's stopped believing that the piles of shit in the corners of his yard are created by packs of vultures. So, I've had to get creative. Brace yourself, this is a truly revolutionary idea. To avoid spending money on flushing your toilet, simply stop eating and drinking anything. What's the point spending all that money on food and beverages if you're just going to flush it down your toilet?

Sometimes when Link is about to die and that dying sound starts to play, I still want to save money so I don't buy potions. I also remember in Majora's Mask, there's that one game in which the cheapskate Zora charges you 10 rupees if you recklessly break pots. To prevent that asshole from taking my money, I always make sure I have 0 rupees and then continue to break the pots.



* When I play Goldeneye 64, I just bitch slap everyone because I don't like wasting bullets.


* When I play Diablo 2, I always pick up ""1 gold"" or ""2 gold."" I remember whenever another person dies and he drops his gold, I immediately pick it up and pretend to claim that I only do it so others don't try to jack his gold.

Lots of podcasts have audible as a sponsor and with this, you get one free audible credit (essentially 1 audiobook) and a 14 day free membership by going to audible.com/*podcastname* but you need to be a member of audible and you can only do these offers once. So instead of signing up with your own email/name/credit card details (as you need a CC for the membership payment to process after 14 days), go to fakenamegenerator.com. This site generates a complete profile, including name, address, CC details and so on, for many countries, both M and F. Using the information generated, sign up to a new account using these details and boom! free audible credit. just make sure to cancel the membership before the end of the free trial (best to do it after downloading your free audiobook).

just repeat for more audiobooks. yes, you have to signup for a new account each time, but as it takes only 5 minutes to do, totally worth it and once you are done downloading, you dont need to access the account again.

why i wrote ""right"" is, because im not sure who benefits with these ""free trial offers"". is it the podcasters, authors or audible? if it is either the podcaster or author, im ok with doing it, but if it is audible, then im not as ok with it as audible is a major corporation who dont need any extra help.

So why buy a toaster? Just let your bread sit out until it's stale and crunchy. You can even make your own croutons this way! Patience may be required, but we all know that patience saves money in the long run! If you already have a toaster, ditch it and save money on electricity.

* Carve your pumpkin with the plastic silverware from a nearby fast food restaurant. Be sure to grab 2 or 30 packs, since they do break sometimes.
* Instead of passing out candy, use the innards and scraps from the pumpkin you carved. Healthy, and absolutely delicious once boiled for 6 hours!
* For a frugal haunted house, walk downtown (or hitchhike, if you are more than 9 miles from downtown) and scope out the area for **non-violent** mentally ill homeless people. Bring them home and promise them food if they scare the children who approach the house.
* Once the night is done, call the police and have them escort the homeless people out. It's basically like a free shuttle for them back to town!

You're welcome, and stay frugal!

I put the tent over my apartment's heating vent and when i come home to a cold apartment... i turn ont he furnace for a few minutes to warm up the interior and then turn it off.

1. I don't like cold sandwich meat, and

2. My thighs rub together.

If any of you guys/gals feel like I do, this suggestion may work for you.  First, make your sandwich in the morning to take to work.  Only thing is, leave your meat separate.  I recommend ham as it smells good and is not costly.

Now, many of you know gold bond is expensive and baby powder just won't disrupt enough of the friction down under to keep my thighs from rashing up.  So, twenty minutes before lunch time, I'll slip the ham slices down the front of my pants, placing them between my thighs.  I'll make sure they aren't bunched, as that can lead to further chafing.  Next, I'll squirt a bit of mayonnaise or honey mustard through a split in my zipper for flavor.  Much like Shake-n-Bake, I'll go for a brisk walk through the building, mushing up all the lunchables in my crotch basket.  Sandy, from Accounting, loves ""my cologne""- her father is a retired deli owner.  After I feel the temperature hit 104-105- trust me, you'll know when it's done- casually walk back to your desk and assemble your sandwich.  

Ham: .89
Bread: .23
Condiment: .12
Veggies (optional): .62

Savings:
Gold Bond: -.78
Energy (warming up your protein): -.43

First... go buy one product so you can have the initial punch punched into your card.

Take a mechanical pencil with the thinnest lead and ""sharpen"" the lead by holding it at an angle while rubbing it (shading) on paper with it. 

Once it has a very fine point, place the punched loyalty card on top of a regular business card and carefully trace out the punch hole with the fine-tipped sharpened mechanical pencil lead. 

Then take the exacto knife and carefully cut out the traced shape on the regular business card. THAT is your permanent template. 

Now use it to trace out the spots on the rewards card, then very carefully cut them out. 

Then turn it in for free product! The employees never check the punchholes too closely.

Second off: mobile post on my really nice smart phone with the big data plan, because I *need* it :)

Since I stumbled upon r/frugal, I have gotten a lot better with my finances. When I first came across you guys, I just moved into my first apartment, with my boyfriend. We liked the area, and the price was right. As well as we were taking over the lease for his elderly father so it worked out well.

We bought a couch with our tax return instead of dumpster diving for a half broken one with two cushions and covered in blood and semen stains after being used as a dumping ground in a crack whore's squat house. Mistake mistake. But... We do love the couch and have since smartened up.

We both work minimum wage, but I'm a cook, and took over the meal planning/budget. You guys suggested taking leftover food from people's plates at my restaurant and taking the food that restaurants throw away at the end of the day. Best choice ever. Large cuts of semi-rotting meat and free! I already knew how to break down meat into portions, but a quick YouTube video taught my boyfriend. Toilet paper is dirt cheap now that we make our own, and fresh fruit is awesome now that I've learned to just take it from someone's private orchard and be lucky enough to be in a place where fruit just grows everywhere. Obviously everywhere has this!

Then I realize the apartment needed a good clean. You guys suggested vinegar and bleach. Well damn. I was concerned about all those *chemicals* so I just used water I saved in a rain bucket out back. Clean apartment for nothing :)

I then started getting in the frugal mood. Finding ways to cut out dollars at a time. Laundry was our big change eater. $1.75 for a wash and $1.75x2 for a dry (the dryer is half the size and needs two runs). So I made a drying rack out of twine and used car parts I found in the alleyway. $1 and has saved us that within just one day! I don't have a living room anymore because the room is taken up by string and metal, but I'm saving money! I cut out paper towels, but then I realized I was washing dish cloths so much I was paying the same. Problem solved: I made my own scrub brush out of my own hair I saved after a haircut and a stick I found in the road. Now I have a cheap and environmentally friendly scrub brush that uses entirely natural renewable resources! No machines!

I started unplugging everything we didn't need plugged in 24/7. Unsure how much it saves. But it makes us think twice before using the microwave or lights or the A/C. I don't think I've used any of them in months. It gets a bit dark at night, but that just means we go to bed earlier and sleep until sunrise. So that's a bonus.

Cut the cord! No more Bell Aliant! Found an old Windows 95 desktop on sale for $10 at Goodwill and hooked it up to our living room tv. We play solitaire, minesweeper, and write documents whenever we want now! Sold our old laptops and his xbox360. We were paying $200 a month for tv before, and barely used it. Now we have shows we follow, and more gaming power! 

We got a kitten. Called around and found the cheapest vet, and started volunteering at the SPCA to receive more discounts. Also started fostering kittens, it's free, they pay for food and litter, and this way we didn't have to buy a second cat as a companion for our terribly hyper kitten. Win win. Pretty soon we'll have enough to make a delicious stew! We reuse their feces and urine as fertilizer for our organic garden with seeds we found in the forest.

Next up was to issue the flow of money. We were poor every week after paycheck and couldn't figure out why. I built a spread sheet (on that awesome new desktop!) and now we have $500 a month to pay off debt. Meaning come the new year, we both will be debt free except for student loans, which both total over $100,000 each, helpfully getting us to our minimum wage jobs. We will be using the snow ball effect though, so hopefully it won't take 12 years to pay off my student loan (as the government predicted).

I was paying $260 a month in cabs, ridiculous. After asking you guys, the answer was clearly to buy a car. Well, that clearly costs money and was out of the question. Instead we found bicycles and plan on strapping baby seats to them when the time arises. 

I'm so grateful r/frugal. You have truly changed our lifestyles, and for the better. We have money to do what we want now, like sit around in the dark and enjoy our time inside, and stopped buying daily ""treats"" and started thinking long term. No more coffees and fast food! And snacks... My boyfriend was the worst for buying daily snacks at work.

Now I make snacks that fit it a 1 cup mason jar. Rice, beans (cheaper than the packaged stuff!), rice &amp; beans, ramen, and all the free fruit that just drops off trees! Rice &amp; beans in jars. Whatever. It's easy for him to grab and it lasts in his bag all day (works security).",,False,self,t5_2vdcr,False,,,True,t3_1213ra,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal_Jerk/comments/1213ra/what_rfrugal_has_taught_me_and_done_for_me/,

I've so far reduced my monthly bill to $0 and have quit my job.

------
###Shelter / Housing
------

Mortgage and rent is an expense that many fatcats unnecessarily pay. You can easily create your own shelter instead of paying extortionate amounts to have one built for you.

LAND - Run to your nearest park or land area that has the least rangers and very little people around. This is vital in not getting caught.

GATHERING MATERIALS - Most department stores have axes, so all you need to do to get an axe is go to the department store at midnight and borrow it. You can return it if you wish but there is no need.

Next, you'll need to find an area with trees. The land you have chosen will be rich with trees, so clear out the area where you will be living in. You can then take the logs and cut them into lumber. Collect mud from the ground to use as glue.


BUILDING - Build a tall cube or rectangular prism to a size of your liking. A rectangle can be cut through the wood for your door. A pile of hay will suffice as a bed.

----
###Food
----
You have 2 options when it comes to food.

###Farming

TOOLS - hoe and lentil seeds which can be found at nearest department store. Borrow them from the store. 

PROCESS - Till area. Plant seeds. Wait for FREE lentils to grow.

FOODS - Lentil soup, raw lentils, etc...

###Persistence Hunting

TOOLS - Stick with rock at the end

PROCESS - Search the area for animals like deer. Once you have found one, chase it until it passes out. Kill with stick.


FOODS - Serve fresh / after killed, or cook over a fire. Fires can be made with sticks.

----
###Entertainment
----

Your entertainment and joy should come from knowing that you beat the fatcat lifestyle and are now frugal. Conventional methods like kicking a rock around result in too much calorie expenditure, and it is highly recommended you do engage in these methods.

----
###Staying Cool
----

Stay at the local library during daylight hours. It will be extremely cool and you won't be releasing so much energy through sweat. Many calories are saved through this.

----
###Internet
----

Local library.

----
###Clothing
----

Hide from animals works very well as clothing. Be sure to wash it in a lake or river beforehand.


**Remember lentils, stay frugal, and use this guide to help minimize costs!**

this led me to come up with a new idea that me and my wife have been doing for a few years now with great success

what you do is take a bus to the airport. I usually counterfeit bus tickets, or throw a mix of small coins and beer bottle caps into the coin collector and pretend like its the $3.50 that the driver asked for. you may have to fake a mental impairment in order to not get kicked off the bus in some areas.

once at the airport, simply look at the flight times and airlines. find the country that sells the goods you're looking for (for example, I just got a genuine hand made samurai sword from Japan). wait at this airline desk until you overhear some passengers checking into a flight to said country. in my example, once I located flights to Japan, I waited for the first Japanese couple that I saw walk up to the desk. pretty easy.

anyway, you simply ask them if they would mind picking you up an item and you'll pay them double when they return. give them a fake home address (yeah, you don't live in a home like the rest of the billionaire sheeple, but they don't have to know that). once they return with your item, just thank them profusely and tell them that the money is in your car. this is where the money savings kicks in - you just run away with the item and BOOM, free stuff!

also sometimes the people don't want to co-operate so you have to be persistent. I've even threatened to hurt their families if they don't do it and most will give in at that point. jokes on them - I don't even know where their family lives!

It's $18.79 for a 30-pound bag, and it usually lasts them about a month.

I used to be a strict vegan, but after realizing how much money I could save by eating the cat food, it was a no brainer for me. [This stuff](http://petfoodtalk.com/catfoodreviews/kirkland-cat-food/) has no artificial ingredients, no weird by-products, and has TONS of antioxidants! I seriously can't believe I had never thought of this before. 

If you're interested, I've included some great frugal recipes to take away the monotony of eating dry cat food day after day:

**Cat food PB&amp;J**

* Take 1 c. cat food (~$0.16) and grind it in a coffee grinder or food processor. Slowly add water until you get a creamy consistency
 
* Spread on two slices of bread ($0.10 if you buy a loaf from the discount Wonder bread store)

* Add jam or jelly, if desired (I usually grab a couple of the jam packets from Denny's)

* Enjoy!!

**Cat food penne pasta**

* Boil 1 c. penne pasta ($0.25 a serving if you purchase in bulk from Costco, which you should do when you buy your cat food!!)
* In a separate pot, mix 1 can of diced tomatoes ($0.50) with desired seasonings. Add 1/2 c. cat food. Simmer for about 20 minutes and serve over pasta. It's like miniature, crunchy meatballs!!

**Cat food a la King**

* Pour yourself a big bowl of Kirkland Super Premium Maintenance Cat
* Sit on your toilet (aka your ""throne"")
* Dine like a king!!
