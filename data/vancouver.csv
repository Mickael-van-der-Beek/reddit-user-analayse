1369318494.0,276,self.vancouver,1ewjp8,Upvote this thread if you think /u/mcantelon should resign as moderator (see information inside),RVancouver,577,301,191,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1ewjp8/upvote_this_thread_if_you_think_umcantelon_should/,"Hello,

Before I'd start, I'd like to explain the reasons for this post and then this account.

Firstly, last night two moderators resigned in protest over the actions (or inactions) of /u/mcantelon. These two moderators included /u/kissnellie and /u/verticaljeff, both of which who I would consider good moderators. They were more or less bothered by the the fact that /u/mcantelon refuses to enforce any rules around here and would rather have everything be allowed in /r/vancouver under the guise of free speech.

Secondly, some of you are probably noticing that this is a post from /u/RVancouver. Yes. I am a troll account, a sock puppet, or maybe someone you just simply don't like, but I exist solely to test the limits of the policy that /u/mcantelon wants to go forward with. I can assure you that once he leaves that I will leave too.

In case you're wondering what I am blabbing about, please read the contents of this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1evmba/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/

I ask of you fellow /r/Vancouver users to up vote this thread if you are in favor of having /u/mcantelon leave this place as moderator and allow for a new team of mods to come in. It doesn't require you to respond here but I believe that the message needs to be loud and clear that he has finished his tenure as moderator.

We're going to have a better place if we have some control over the constant barrage of useless threads. He has decided that he wants to make ""some changes"" but as you can see in that thread, collective confidence has been lost in him.

Once he is gone I am gone. I am not interested in the job of being moderator but I want to see this place shaken up a bit.

1368215234.0,252,self.vancouver,1e3601,AMA - Translink Bus Driver,What_the_FAQ,284,32,355,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1e3601/ama_translink_bus_driver/,"Been driving in Vancouver for a few years now, and am happy to answer your questions as honestly as I can. I listed Translink above, but the actual subsidiary company is Coast Mountain Bus. AMA!

Edit - I have some commitments to take care of tonight so I'm out soon. But I'll check in when I can with my phone. Also, apologies in advance if I make spelling/grammatical errors from my phone...I'll correct them when I get back on the laptop.

Edit 2 - will continue this tomorrow when I wake up, I am pooped and a little tipsy right now. G'night folks!

Edit 3 - Here's some common questions coming up:

Q:What is the top thing every passenger should know?

A: Please have your fare/pass ready BEFORE you board. A LOT of times buses run late because we'll have a number of passengers get on the bus, then start digging out their passes/coins at the door. That delays people from boarding and the bus from leaving on time. This all adds up if it happens constantly on the route and a few minutes here and there add up to a bus being 10+ minutes late on the entire route.

Q: Why do buses come two at a time?

A: It's a phenomenon called bus platooning. And especially with trolleys, since we're on the same trolley wires, we can't pass each other. There is no dynamic way to adjust schedules on the fly to have one bus wait longer at a stop if the one ahead is running behing (then the bus behind me would catch up). So a lot of times you'll see two of the same bus pull into the same spot.
What we try to do is get all the people waiting at the stop to board the second bus as it will mean the first bus will have less people to drop off and possibly catch up some time. However, people ALWAYS run for the first bus thinking it will get them to their destination 2 seconds faster. This just delays everything as the first bus get loaded again and has to make all the stops and the guy in the back can't do anything but follow. Also, we try our best to 'skip stop' if another bus is right behind us, meaning that the first bus will not stop at a stop if no one needs to get off, knowing that the second bus is just right behind or a few seconds behind. Unfortunately this just pisses off a lot of people who simply just dont look behing to see the second bus, they just assume the driver did not pick them up. I've seen a lot of middle digits because of this :( Sorry folks!

Q: Fare Evasion

A: If i tried to enforce everything and get in arguments with passengers, all that is going to happen is that my bus will be late for all my route then, thus pissing off all the waiting passengers. I know that most people get off in a few stops, so it's best to keep going. There are drivers out there (just as people in any job), who take things too personally, or try to be hard-ass. That's their prerogative, just not mine.

Honestly, if you drive a route long enough, its always the same people with the same excuses. I lost my pass, my transfer just expired (4 hours go), I don't have any cash, etc.
It sucks, but I just expect it now. And I can't really do anything because most just walk on by and say they don't have any fare casually as they just stroll past you. If I tried to enforce people paying, I would hold up the bus at most stops and just annoy all the other passengers just trying to get home/work.
I usually don't care, but it's frustrating when you see someone with a bag of McDonalds, or a case of beer get on and say they don't have any money. The sense of self-entitlement from a lot of people is frustrating. And a lot of the time its the constant free-riders that cause the most problems once they get on.",,False,self,t5_2qhov,1368299706.0,,,True,t3_1e3601,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1e3601/ama_translink_bus_driver/,

1330453067.0,240,self.vancouver,q9yya,CL post on Vancouver rental ads nails it - An open letter to Vancouver landlords,K_e_W,270,30,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/q9yya/cl_post_on_vancouver_rental_ads_nails_it_an_open/,"Because [the post](http://vancouver.en.craigslist.ca/van/apa/2875427096.html) will probably get flagged/removed soon, here's the full text: 

Dear landlords of Vancouver:

I know it's difficult for you. You are all just hardworking people struggling to maintain your right to have someone else pay the mortgage, and trying to avoid the unfair situation of having your second home or investment property unoccupied for a month. I feel your pain, truly. However, there are a few things that I think might be helpful in your noble endeavour, and I'd like to pass them on in solidarity:

1. A closet is not a den. If it doesn't have a window, a door, a wall, or more than ten square feet of space, it is not a den. 

2. A den is not a bedroom. Even if your second, clearly demarcated room is so expansive as to be able to fit a table and chair, if it cannot fit a bed, it is not a second bedroom.

3. ""Separate entrance"" is not a selling feature of an apartment. If it does not have a separate entrance, it is not an apartment. Ditto ""ceilings over 7 feet"", ""full bathroom"", and ""full kitchen.""

4. Burnaby is not Vancouver. It is not East Vancouver. It is not Commercial Drive, or Trout Lake. It is Burnaby. Coquitlam, Mayne Island, and Assmunch, Arizona are also not Vancouver. Most prospective tenants will clue in to this when you give them the address.

5. It's logically impossible to be 5 minutes' walk from Renfrew Station, *and* from Commercial Drive.

6. Granville Street is not ""right next to"" or ""just west of"" Main Street.

7. If your rental space is within ten feet of a major artery, like Broadway, 12th Avenue, or Kingsway, it is not quiet. Can't hear what I'm saying? It is NOT QUIET.

8. ""Cozy"" and ""small"" and ""cramped"" all have different definitions, which might be helpful to review.

9. A basement suite is a basement suite. A garden level suite is a basement suite. A ground floor suite is a basement suite. An ""almost above ground"" ground floor suite is a basement suite.

10. Laminate flooring is not hardwood. Laminate is plastic. Hardwood is wood. Hence, hardwood.

11. You can have ONE damage deposit, and it is completely refundable. You can't have two, and you can't have a handful of nonrefundable cash to hold a place for 2 hours.

12. A ""bathroom"" is a place with a toilet, a sink, a shower and/or tub, *walls*, and *a door*. If you are tempted to call something that does not meet this definition a ""bathroom"", take a moment to clarify in your ad that it is a toilet in the middle of the bedroom, or using more traditional phraseology, an ""open pit latrine.""

13. If one cannot see the mountains/ocean or other advertised geographic features by looking out the window, the apartment does not have a ""gorgeous view."" If one has to crane one's body out the window and dangle precariously in order to try to see the horizon, it is not a ""peek a boo"" view of the North Shore. It is a latent lawsuit.

14. There is no such thing as ""one mouse, that one time"" Ditto cockroach or bedbug.

15. Landlords, I know you are very busy collecting money and trying to earn interest on it, and you barely have two cents to rub together in this harsh economic climate, but please know that it is not your tenants' responsibility to paint or repair your rental space. This is part of your job, because you collect the rental income. It's a new concept to you, I know, but should be fairly easy to remember if you consider the logic of it. When the happy day comes that your tenant owns her own living space, *then* she can do her own repairs and maintenance.

16. ""Old"" is not ""heritage."" It is not even ""character"", really. While the Vancouver Special style of housing arguably *forms* part of Vancouver's heritage, it does not in any way meet the criteria for heritage designation and the attached rent premium.

17. Try to keep your word about showing times. If you make an appointment with prospective tenants, and then decide to rent the place to the first person with cash in hand, please use your phone skills to let your other prospective tenants know that they no longer have to take transit across the city to view your place.

18. No means no. If I have decided not to rent your poorly maintained, possibly ""one-mouse"" infested, heritage, gorgeous almost-top-floor basement suite, with two bedrooms and a den, with peek a boo views, just next to granville island at the quiet intersection of hastings and boundary, *please* do not contact me again by email or phone to persuade me that your rental suite is amazing. I am not looking for a new friend who collects rent, I am looking for a decent place to live.

As the first order of business I fixed the sidebar, so that it's actually useful to visitors. This took one day. As a result, *Visiting Vancouver* queries were substantially reduced. Nonetheless, some users continue to be incredibly rude to tourists asking for advice. One user in particular has made it their mission to harass and belittle innocent posters who wander into this sub hoping for some useful direction.

This user has made multiple accounts masquerading as a moderator here, which received many complaints. This same user also created accounts strictly to bitch and moan about what a shithole this sub is, and what fascists the moderators are.  This user spent the whole day yesterday creating shit-storms, and harassing other users. The bot deleted a number of this user's posts, kissnellie zapped one I think, and I finally banned the ones masquerading as a moderator, and a public figure. 

The moderator [mcantelon](http://www.reddit.com/user/mcantelon/comments/) however has reinstated those accounts, and is encouraging this user to continue to act like an obnoxious jerk. I am therefore resigning as a mod here. Incredibly /u/mcantelon sees no real role for moderators in Redditt, at all. This was abundantly evident from his complete lack of participation here over the last year and half. He has actually told me that he believes that no moderation at all here is necessary, and that down-votes alone are the only correct tool to deal with racism, misogyny, abusive behaviour, impostures, and other behaviors not allowed in well-run and respected subs. 

I tried to improve the conversation here, and politely asked the users to respect reddiquette. This moderator's almost complete absence here over the last year and half suddenly changed when I took on this role.  After not appearing in the moderation logs at all for months, never responding to reports, or contact requests, suddenly he is all over the sub, reinstating and encouraging liars, bigots, and trolls. 

I am therefore sadly resigning as a moderator of this sub.  This was a position I only took on reluctantly after many requests from users. To all those who sent notes of encouragement, I am sorry to disappoint you. 

I expect that after I am gone, [mcantelon](http://www.reddit.com/user/mcantelon/comments/) will go back to ignoring this place again, and you'll only have kissnellie to try to put out fires.

1360538863.0,233,self.vancouver,189uf6,Do you want to be able to drink a Beer at the Beach? I do. Interested?,nolanrh,290,57,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/189uf6/do_you_want_to_be_able_to_drink_a_beer_at_the/,"I have posted this before, but with the new liquor reform announcements and all the discussion on what people want to see in the province’s liquor laws, I’ve decided to push forward with it.

I propose that we start a campaign that demands liquor law reform of the sort that matters to ordinary British Columbians.

What are some examples of what I want?

1.  I want to be able to take a bottle of wine or a beer on a picnic with my wife and not risk being hasseled or getting a ticket.  I am a responsible adult, let me behave like one.

2.  I want a store like the modern bartender, which specializes in cocktail accessories, to be able to sell the specialty items they want to.

3.  I want a bar that has a video game theme to be able to also serve alcohol.

I propose that we develop a liquor reform campaign for the upcoming provincial election that targets people who may not otherwise vote. We keep it dead simple and provide an easy to engage with issue.  “Do you want to be able to drink a beer at the beach? If yes, then join our cause and vote for someone who will make that happen.”

How do I envision the campaign working? The first step is probably a youtube video that sets out exactly what we’re after in one minute or less. Using the video and word of mouth, we gather a critical mass of voters on a Facebook page (or other petition site).  During the provincial election campaign, we host a live event (i.e. awesome party) in order to prove that online supports can be turned into real life bodies on voting day.  Then we say to the politicians, if you commit to making these demands a priority if you’re elected, we will send our supporters your way. 

The way I see it, once we start the video circulating, this either blows up as an election issue or dies and just goes away. There is nothing to lose. 

I’ve started a Beer on the Beach Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/BeerAtTheBeach) as a place to organize a first meeting. ‘Like it’, if you are interested.

TL;DR  If you want to be able to drink a beer on the beach after the next provincial election, join our Facebook group, attend an awesome party, and vote on election day.

(Right lane, not in anyone's way. Roads were fairly empty between 7:00pm and 8:00pm.)

What I found, wasn't a surprise for me, but I thought I'd share it...

I was passed probably upwards of 100-200 times on the ~45 minute drive. I did not keep pace with any vehicle I could see on the road, the entire trip. I passed one car, that was driving 70 in an 80 zone.

Every car on the road was driving 100+ in 80 zones, and 120+ in 100 zones. If not more.

I felt more than a little unsafe driving the legal limit; I was being passed on the left for the most part, although some people chose to pass on the right when there were 3 non-HOV lanes available.

A lot(50%, to guess?) of people didn't signal while changing lanes to pass me. At least two of the people who did failed to turn off their signal afterwards.

I was almost rear-ended/sideswiped(Driving straight, at the speed limit.) once, when a driver didn't fully enter the next lane while passing me.

There were a couple actual speeders(Given the average speed on this highway is obviously 10-20km/h above the legal speed, I'm calling actual speeding 130km/h or higher.) who blew by me, but not many.

So, why on earth are these speed limits along this stretch of highway(Probably beyond. I used to commute to Chilliwack a few years ago, and from memory, the highway is not much different. It's been a while since I've driven out past that to say, Hope, so I don't remember the highway there well enough to say with confidence.), as low as they are? All it's doing is making the vast majority driving it be constantly breaking the law, and driving unsafely with those who are following the law due to the speed difference. To say nothing of the ridiculousness of speeding fines and the 40km/h over impound laws, just for keeping up with sane traffic and being part of the majority. The highway is easily safe enough for 120km/h.

How can we get this unreasonably low limit changed?",,False,self,t5_2qhov,False,,,True,t3_1ebxat,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1ebxat/so_i_drove_the_speed_limit_yesterday/,

The goal of the campaign is to target motorcycles and cars that are emitting excessive noise levels and enhance the quality of life for residents living along well travelled routes.

On occasion, officers see motorcyclists riding around with ear plugs because the mufflers are too loud. During a recent encounter, a traffic enforcement officer followed a motorcycle for two blocks when the rider wasnt able to hear the siren over his mufflers.

This past weekend, the Vancouver Police Traffic Enforcement Unit tested over fifty motorcycles and cars and found 19 vehicles were not in compliance. The riders or drivers were issued either a $109 fine under the Motor Vehicle Act or a Notice and Order to have the muffler repaired.

“This is a good time to remind the public that with the warm weather comes an increase in the number of motorcycles on the road,” says Staff Sergeant Howard Chow of the VPD Traffic Enforcement unit.

“We would like to remind riders to be safe and considerate of others while they are out enjoying the sun.”

Quick Facts

•the allowable decibel reading for motorcycles is less than 92 decibels
•the allowable decibel reading for cars is less than 84 decibels
•ear damage occurs at 85 decibels or greater
•average lawnmower and chainsaw is about 90 decibels
•jackhammer is about 130 decibels
•loudest motorcycle tested over this past weekend was 112 decibels

",CopingInVancouver,181,26,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/19c7jf/dealing_with_depression_a_vancouver_guide/,"
Hi all,

I've been dealing with depression on-and-off for years now, but only recently decided to deal with it. The only problem was... how the hell do you go about finding professional help for depression in Vancouver? 

Let's face it, it can be quite overwhelming to find psychological help online. Where does one even begin? Hence this guide: a few quick steps to help out those that are dealing with depression in Vancouver.

**Step 1: Finding a counsellor**

This can be the most overwhelming part, as private counsellors can cost between $100-175 an hour. Luckily, there are affordable counselling services provided by local health boards.

*If you live in Vancouver:* Call the Adult Mental Health Intake line at 604-675-3997. Tell them that you are looking for a counselling referral. They will take your details (Name, CareCard #, and phone #) and have an intake worker call you back within the next few days to get the referral process going (they actually called me back the same day). The intake worker will provide you with all of the necessary information for finding affordable counselling within Vancouver.

Alternatively, you can call the BC Family Services line at 604-874-2938. They will recommend you to a counselling that has fees on an affordable sliding scale system.

*If you live in the suburbs:* I don't have first-hand experience here, but you can start by calling your local Fraser Health mental health office. Contact information can be found here: [Fraser Health Mental Health Offices](http://www.fraserhealth.ca/?section_id=5202&amp;section_copy_id=121&amp;program_id=8532)

Some of these programs will require a referral from a doctor. If you don't have a regular family doctor, any walk-in clinic will be able to provide you with such a referral.

Note: if you are nervous about phoning these offices... don't be! I know I was, and put it off for weeks. But remember: **these people are here to help you**. They're incredibly professional and caring, and there's no judgement going on whatsoever. So give them a call today!

**Step 2: Antidepressants?**

Man, asking for advice about antidepressants online will cause nothing but a storm of conflicting opinions. All I will say about this topic is this: avoid self-diagnosis, and get a professional medical opinion if you feel that antidepressants are the route you wish to go. If possible, find a doctor you can see again on a semi-regular basis for your follow-up appointments. I know this isn't necessarily possible if you are going to a walk-in clinic, so see if you can find a permanent physician in your neighbourhood (I know, I know, easier said than done...)

**Step 3: Talk to your friends and family**

Honestly, I think this is *the* most important step, and usually the one most avoided. I've been dealing with depression for over a decade now, but only started telling my friends and family this past month. It was the emotional version of coming out-of-the-closet for me. And do you know what? It's the greatest thing I've ever done. 

I understand why we chose not to share depression with others, given all of the stigma around it. But trust me: those closest to you won't judge, and if anything, it will make your bonds that much stronger. If you have trouble explaining to people what depression is exactly, I highly recommend sharing with them this lecture by Standford's Robert Sapolsky: [Stanford's Sapolsky On Depression in U.S.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc)

**What's next?**

Congratulate yourself on taking the first steps in dealing with depression... facing it can be one of the most daunting tasks, but taking these initial steps will be one of the best decisions of your life. Just remember though, there's no quick-fix here, and it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of work to overcome it. That said, always remember this: **you will beat it, and you're not alone**.

""Cuchillo"", she told me without hesitation, ""it's close to work and I hear it's great"". I made a reservation, took some money I'd been saving for a rainy day and told my friend where to meet me.

You weren't outside when we arrived so we had no idea what was coming when we were ready to leave after a lovely meal. ""What's going on out there?"", my buddy's girlfriend said as we neared the door. I decided to ask when we got outside, but I didn't get a chance because I was yelled at before I could open my mouth.

""Fucking yuppie!"" I was informed, much to my surprise since I live in the suburbs and have about 10 years on most of the folks protesting.  But since you didn't ask how could you have known that the money I saved for that rare night out was what I usually spend on groceries for a week? 

I will extend you the same courtesy and make assumptions I couldn't possibly substantiate since I don't know anything about you. Since you were crass and look the part you are of course all hipster douchebags whose concerns I now give zero fucks about since you alienated a potential ally who works down the street.

To everyone else, as I intend to tell my friends and coworkers, I highly recommend Cuchillo, the food was delightful (try the ceviche!) the service was excellent and it was well worth the money for nice night out. 

Just ignore the protesters, they're not there to inform or facilitate change, they just want an excuse to insult people.

(Details and pic in the description.) ,whodiblah,169,15,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/oaee4/everyone_who_uses_public_transit_on_the_north/,"http://i.imgur.com/AIQPd.jpg


At Phibbs Exchange [this man](http://i.imgur.com/AIQPd.jpg) sat next to me on the 232 Grouse Mountain bus. He seemed to be putting an excessive amount of pressure on me with his left arm, I didn't think much of it, he seemed like a stocky guy. A little later on the ride he started moving his arm back and forth ever so slightly, while continuing to apply pressure. Then later around 23rd and Lonsdale he crept his right hand over to my thigh while looking straight ahead, not acknowledging what he was doing. When I pulled the cord to get off on Queens Rd(Around the Delbrook Rec-Center), I said ""Excuse me"" to get to the door, he got off at the same stop. At first he turned left at the sidewalk as I turned right. I look back, and he's facing me and not moving. I start to walk a little faster. I turn back again and he is still staring, but now he was following me. I decide not to go home, and walked straight into the rec-center. After a few minutes I poke my head out the door and I see him waiting at the corner. I proceed to call the RCMP and gave a description. 


A few weeks later, I tell my friend about what happened. THE NEXT DAY, he calls me saying that he was on a nearly empty bus heading to Lonsdale Quay, and the man that fit the description was sitting next to him, putting pressure against him with his arm. 


And tonight, that same friend saw him again, and confronted him saying ""Haven't I seen you before?"" while trying to take some pictures. [This was the best one he got.](http://i.imgur.com/AIQPd.jpg)


**tl;dr: [This guy](http://i.imgur.com/AIQPd.jpg) was leaning against me on the bus and tried to slide his hand down my thigh, and tried to follow me home. Friend had similar encounter, and got a picture of him. Young male redditors on the North Shore beware of this man, and if he harasses you report him to the RCMP.**

I saw 3 close calls last night on my commute - 2 bikers and 1 pedestrian almost getting clipped by cars.

Get good ***working*** lights on your bike. Even with lights, act as if drivers still cant see you because... They generally don't. I almost hit a fellow biker last night in the rain for being in dark clothing and no lights.

I don't judge people with fixed-gear bikes negatively, but if you don't have *real* brakes you are a fool. Even if you're amazing with skid stops and backpedaling, thats no replacement for real brakes.

Reflective shit - Get some.

Fenders: Your choice, but I don't know how people that live out here can live without them. 

There's way more traffic out there now that school is back in and the good-weather bikers are jumping in their cars to stay dry. [Note the worst parts of your commute](http://blogs.ubc.ca/maps/2011/12/16/404/) and be on high alert.

 A year ago, I met this guy while walking Downtown, on West Georgia, somewhere between Granville and Seymour (IIRC). He was panicking, was wearing a black t shirt and grey jeans. He told me this story about how he was visiting his long distance girlfriend, and that she had thrown him out without letting him get his things. He said he lived in Whistler, didn't know anyone here, and that he needed money to get to, at least Squamish, where he had a friend. Now, I had just moved to Vancouver, didn't know anyone, and empathized with him. High on the feeling of 'Today you, tomorrow me', I gave him the money to buy him a bus ticket. We exchanged phone numbers, and we parted. I didn't bother following up or calling the number he gave me. The way I saw it, it was my good deed for the day, and moved on with my life. 

 This dude stops me in the street today, and begins telling me that he is not from here. Then stopped, and left me standing there confused. It took me a few minutes to realize it's the same guy. By the time I did, he'd ducked into the subway. Like I said, I don't particularly care about the money, it wasn't that much. 

 He was just one block down from where he stopped me last time, this time on Dunsmuir, which leads me to think he is roaming around in the same area. Like I said, I don't particularly care if he's caught or not. I'm the guy who wouldn't bat an eye if I saw someone looking for help. Before any of you say it, I realize how stupid that is. And yeah, maybe I deserved being taken advantage of for being so fucking stupid.

 It just sickens me that I'd be wary of helping someone who legitimately needs my help next time. So, my fellow Vancouverites, beware. ",,False,self,t5_2qhov,False,,,True,t3_1bto3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1bto3x/beware_the_con_man_looking_to_go_to/,

Tucked away in this industrial and commercial area, it still manages to stand out as you drive by, bright yellow paint splashed against a field of blue stucco. The sign in the window indicates they have ""The Best Sandwich in North America"". The sign on the door warns of foul language, nudity and a requirement to say please and thank you. 

Inside, a bright eyed Lebanese fellow greets you loudly. Immediately, the banter begins. Questions, postulations, stories and jokes. The more customers there are inside, the rowdier it gets. The chatter today started with prison rape and went down-hill from there. But it's not all laughter and dirty jokes. One customer had the gall to answer his cell.

""Get the fuck out of my store, foreigner!"" he yelled at the man who, based on appearances, could have come from the same Lebanese village. ""That is rude, very fucking rude! If you do that again you cannot come back here again!""

He was deadpan but laughing as he said it and everyone else was laughing along. At times it got so obscene that my laughter prevented me from eating! ... Eating? Right, it's a restaurant!

He makes fucking amazing sandwiches. The sign in the window makes a bold claim and he backs it up. First, he asks you about your bread. ""Long and hard or short and soft? I request the limp bread. Next the different flavour options for the bread; French, Italian, herb and poppyseed loaves are displayed above the prep area. I go for the poppyseed. And then...

He turns to me and says ""Do you trust me?""

""Yes,"" I reply.

For the next few minutes he slices off thick strips of corned beef, ham, salami and other meats, followed up by a stack of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and mustard, the whole time carrying on about how he used to be a male prostitute in England.

The sandwich is so large that I still have half of it in my van. I'm a pretty big guy and I can pack food away, but half a sandwich is all I can tackle. Tack on a can of soda and you come to the grand total of... **$9**. You couldn't buy the amount of meat he puts on the sandwich at a grocery store for less than $15, and the cheese would probably run you another $10. 

You should probably go get a sandwich there, unless you're easily offended. Don't trust someone who talks about fisting to make your sandwich? You can still buy the meat, cheese and other deli stuff there too.

This really scares me, because it makes me worry that some day I'll end up hitting a cyclist who is doing this.

I totally understand wanting to stay away from traffic and how it *feels* safer to be on the sidewalk, but it's actually putting you at far greater risk.  As a motorist, I'm used to looking for two things at intersections -- rapidly moving vehicles in the roadway, and slow moving pedestrians on the sidewalk/crosswalk.  Even in the cases where there are no trees / newspaper boxes / etc. hiding you, you're much less visible on the sidewalk simply because motorists *aren't expecting to see you there*.  The human brain is very bad at seeing things it's not looking for (as evidenced by the famous ""invisible gorilla"" experiment).

Please, stay on the road where we expect you to be and are more likely to notice you.  It's not just the law, it's also safer.

Fire Pizza, which has been there for a couple of years, and a new 4 Brothers location that opened up right next-door after another shop shut down.

Since 4 Brothers opened up shop next to Fire, Hans (the owner) has had his patio chairs and signs vandalized, being knocked over and spat on, and he has even been spat on himself. It is a constant state of hostility that has resulted in several police visits at the request of Fire Pizza employees.

The most recent incident is the result of veiled threats towards Hans’ wife and daughter. Police have responded again but it’s another case of ‘he said she said.’ It’s obscene that this group of people would treat anyone this way, but it’s even more frustrating since I know Hans to be nothing but kind and friendly man. To bring his family into it makes me feel like I should do something, however minute.

Should you be in the neighborhood looking for a slice I’m asking you to vote with your wallet (and get better pizza anyways – Fire Pizza is awesome!) and steer clear of these abusive and menacing storeowners. I would never in good conscience give any money to those 4 Brothers dicks and neither should you.


Edit: Take this at face value, I witnessed nothing personally but I've done my greatest to get an accurate (and admittedly shallow) understanding of the events. My only vested interest is that I like Hans as a person, trust his character, and enjoy pizza in general.

So to be clear, it wasn't a pick up line, it was a joke! Clearly the girl as well as some of you do not share my sense of humor, others do, which is greatly appreciated!  Thanks.

so about two months ago i was leaving Metrotown mall when [a young, black man](http://i.imgur.com/CbCQwog.jpg) wearing a suit and ray bans came up to me and asked for some help. he claimed he was mugged leaving his hotel by some ""tapout douchebags"". he lost his wallet and phone apparently and he just wanted to get the greyhound to Abbotsford to his grandmas house. ""i'm clearly not a crack head, i just want to get out of here""

i asked him how much he needs and he said 50 bucks. i wasn't intimidated or threatened by him at all. like i said he seemed like an OK dude so i gave him 60 bucks. he wanted to exchange info to pay me back but i work close by so i told him where and that he could drop off the cash anytime. i smoked a cig with him and chatted and that was that.

i never saw that 60 dollars again.

fast forward to today out front waterfront station, the same guy propositions me. this time he's just dressed all hip hop like. really fly gear. again, looks like a normal dude / talks like a normal dude. he opens with ""hey man, look, im not a crack head or anything...."" I cut him off and tell him he still owes me 60 bucks. he gets all butt hurt and i just walk away. 

my fault for being fooled. but I'm just going to put it out there just in case.

he's a normal looking, average, black guy with a sob story. don't give him money. he must have a drug problem or is just incredibly lazy. but he is good at what he does judging by the way he can afford to dress.



edit: [this is the guy](https://www.facebook.com/makk.murda), thank you dualboot.





**edit: to all the people calling me an idiot for giving a stranger 60 dollars. i just want to make it clear that i had no intention of ever getting the money back, i legitimately thought this dude was in need of some help. 60 dollars is no skin off of my back and i would do it all over again if it felt right. nothing beats the feeling i get from helping someone out. i do what i want with my money.",,False,self,t5_2qhov,1368848397.0,,,True,t3_1ehp4a,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1ehp4a/watch_out_well_dressed_young_black_guy_took/,

We're a no-kill TNR shelter in the lower mainland that works alongside other shelters (SPCA, Katie's Place, etc) to stop overpopulation of feral colonies and try to tame and relocate animals so they can live happy and healthy lives. We also help those kitties with special needs and long term illness (such as Fel-V) to find the right forever homes and get proper treatment.

http://www.orphankittenrescue.com/home/

Upcoming events include:

January 19 from 10 am to 4 pm at Bosley's - Burquitlam Plaza 562 Clarke Road in Coquitlam

January 26 10:30 am to 4:30 pm at Bosley's - 3045 West Broadway in Vancouver

January 26 11 am 3 pm at Tisol - #103 - 3010 152 Street in South Surrey

If you know anyone who is interested in adopting pass it on, they can get pre-approved online.

Adoption fees (plus a list of what they include) and applications can be found here: http://www.orphankittenrescue.com/adoption_fees/

We also have a gallery of our cats and kittens up for your viewing pleasure (including happy already adopted list for those looking for some ""awwww"" in their day): http://www.orphankittenrescue.com/view_gallery

And for those fellow bleeding hearts who just want to know how they can help VOKRA out: http://www.orphankittenrescue.com/volunteer

P.S. I apologize if there's a more appropriate subreddit to post this in and would genuinely appreciate if anyone knew of one. I gave up after digging through about 1500+ of them on the subreddits list.

UPDATE 1/27/2013: Thank you, /r/Vancouver! Along with you and the newspapers we had two very successful adoption events this weekend.

The protests alienated a lot of potential allies by protesting GMOs, when it should have been about protesting Monsanto specifically. What Monsanto does is pretty fucking shitty, and it has nothing to do with GMOs itself.

Seems like many of those that actually did target Monsanto, did so purely out of the fact that the company is in the GMO business. That's like hating Hitler because he was a fascist, and not for what he did.

The City of Surrey is described as a Canadian city, approximately 132 years old, covering 317 square kilometers, and having a population of approximately 460,000. 

It is alleged that Surrey attacked Vancouver at approximately 8:00pm, while the city was heading home after a hockey game. No other cities are suspected in the attack, though many municipalities were in the area at the time.

Local news crews filmed a Surrey T-shirt in the vicinity of the attack. Other witnesses couldn't confirm that the angry mob was the City of Surrey, but many believe it was the city in question. Surrey has a history of violence, and is well known to police.

The motivation behind the attack is not known at this time, though according to Vancouver it may be related to Surrey being a shitty place.

Anyone with information related to the attack or the current location of the City of Surrey should contact Vancouver police.

Is anyone interested in helping to take a voter or five to the polls either on Election Day or to the advance polls?

I figure people can post their voting districts in the comments and then new voters can buddy up and each voting district can have a group of voters head to the polls (or district office if people want to vote any day before Election Day).

You can find out where your closest polling place is by visiting the [Elections BC website](www.elections.bc.ca/ge2013/#whereAndWhenToVote). You can also find out who the candidates are in your riding.

I'll start: I'm in Vancouver-Fairview.

He told me he was an avid game player since the days of original Nintendo. His wife and him would play Nintendo until 2-3am in the morning. She didn't want to play the games but loved to sit and watch him play and experience it with him. He explained how he would often get frustrated with the puzzle parts of games and how she would talk him through it and help him complete them, They were the perfect team, what a lucky man. They used to call the Nintendo tip hotline in the middle of the night so much that they knew him and his wife by name when they would call. He made sure to point out that the hotline was definitely not toll free. He has lived on a pension for years, so each game he plays is really special to him, and he takes his time and completes them. His wife died about three years ago and he didn't continue playing video games.
He recently acquired a PlayStation 2 from a friend of his and has been trying to play through the resident evil series but was hopelessly stuck on the puzzles and didn't know what to do. Him and I spent a little time looking online and found a strategy guide to print out. I have never seen someone so overjoyed about a strategy guide, considering his wife used to be his strategy guide I am not surprised how happy he was. He gave me a tip and hurried out of my store to go home and work on his game, exclaiming he would be back anytime he needed game advice. What an awesome guy, he brought the hugest smile to my face.
TLDR : Old guy and his wife love gaming. (Most people suggest you should take a minute out of your day and read it anyways)

[UPDATE]
The man came in again this morning. One of the puzzles in the guide didn't make sense to him. He joked about calling the Nintendo hotline after all these years saying that the guy would say ""holy f*ck, you're still alive?"" We looked up a video of his puzzle on ""the youtube"" and sorted it out for him. I told him the tears and joy his story brought to so many people. I told him how some people didn't believe this had even occurred, he agreed those people must lead sad lives. He showed me a picture of his wife and talked of how much he missed her. I asked if I could get a picture with him to share with all the people wanting to put a face to his story, [he agreed](http://i.imgur.com/pXvBk.jpg) . He is holding the picture of his wife that he carries in his wallet. I am holding the page of the IGN guide he brought in (that we printed out yesterday), that he had scribbled random numbers all over trying to sort out the puzzle. He then excitedly rushed to his scooter and tore off to open the music box on the wall in RE: Code Veronica.
I won't be posting every update about this guy on Reddit. I will post them on my [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/nickervision) though. If I've set it correctly, anyone can view it.

Post your own and I'll add them.

These are off the top of my head, so I'll edit this and post more as you guys (hopefully) share more.

disclaimer: I'm focusing on an east-van crowd vibe, so keep that in mind

**Mondays**:   
1) Quiz Night &amp; Name That Tune (alternating) at the Cascade Room on Main.  
2) www.eastvancomedy.com has some fun improv and Graham Clark's comedy show Laugh Gallery happens there. Shows happen Sunday and Monday at Havana on Commercial.  
  
**Tuesdays**  
1) The Cobalt on Main near the Skytrain - all the pinball machines are free, and they've got free 4 player N64 on a projector with games like Goldeneye, Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros!

**Wednesdays**:   
1) 'This Ain't Yo Momma's Bingo' at Hyde on Main. Two burlesque hostesses lead the packed room through some dirty-sexy bingo with nicely-lewd commentary.  
2) Trivia Night at the Five Point on Main  
3) Karaoke at the Legion on Main &amp; 23rd  
4) Poetry Slam at Cafe Deux Soleils on Commercial and 5th  
5) The Cobalt is running SNAG, a live painting art raffle with 4 different artists each week. Some good stuff there.  

**Thursdays**  
1) Our Town Trivia at Our Town Cafe, E Broadway &amp; Kingsway: http://ourtowntrivia.blogspot.ca/  
2) Burlesque at the Keefer in Chinatown  
3) DJ'd swing dance every Thursday put on by Rhythm City Swing at St Michael's church in East Van. They offer regular progressive lessons, too, if you want to learn. Every fifth week they do a drop in lesson and live band.  

**Sundays**  
1) Burlesque at the Biltmore, Kingsway &amp; 12th  
2) The Kozmik Zoo (53 W. Broadway) hosts a hilarious improv show called The Sunday Service. They recently won the Canadian Comedy Award for best improv troupe; the shows are $7 and absolutely worth it. They do two halves, the first is a series of short form improv ""games"" and the second half is a long form free-for-all improv. Starts at 9, but come early.  
3) www.eastvancomedy.com has some fun improv and Graham Clark's comedy show Laugh Gallery happens there. Shows happen Sunday and Monday at Havana on Commercial.   

**1st Monday of the Month**:   Hard Rock Miners' Sing-along Night at the Railway Club (downtown). Go early with friends, get a songbook, and shout of the lyrics to 'Tainted Love' with the rest of the cheerfully drunk crowd. Fills up early.

**2nd or 3rd Monday of the Month**:   Hip Hop Karaoke at Fortune Sound Club (chinatown). This isn't your dad's karaoke night... tons of talented amateurs take turns rapping their favourite covers, and the crowd eats it up. Generally $3 cover before 10?  

**Last Wednesday of the Month**:   
1) The Critical Hit Show at the Rio Theatre at Broadway and Commercial. A live improv comedy D&amp;D session
2) Big Shiny 90s Bingo at The Morrissey, only $5 to play all night, all 90s music all night.  
  
**First Wednesday of the Month**  
1) Talent Time. Variety show hosted by Paul Anthony. At the Biltmore on the first Wednesday of the month. Crazy variety show. Lots of fun $8. http://talenttime.tv/main.html  
  
**Third Wednesday of the Month**  
1) Say Wha?! at the Cottage Bistro is a literary/comedy show where funny people read from bad books.

**1st Friday of the Month**:   Friday Night Supper at the Ukranian Hall (10th and Ontario), the legendary perogie night. Bring friends, get fed by a bunch of adorable church ladies.  

**Sporadic/Ongoing**  
1)Raincity Chronicles - A semi-regular storytelling night for amateurs and the public. Stories revolve around a theme and performances range from hilarity and beauty to cringe-worthy.  
2) Pecha Kucha - A storytelling night at the Vogue, well worth seeing. Tickets are usually around $12  
3) Vancouver Trade School - barter to learn cool new skills? Hell yes. http://tradeschool.coop/Vancouver/class  
4) Fringe Festival - typically in September around Granville Island. Amazing. Must go.  
5) TheatreSports at Granville Island. Live improve. Never been, heard it's a riot.  
6) Guilt and Co also has a live trad jazz band on alternating Wednesdays; come out, enjoy the music, and enjoy the swing dancers that come out to enjoy the music.  
7) The Rio puts on a helluva burlesque show! They are sporadic and include slam poets, comedians, and AMAZING musicians!

So why? If you guys have NextBus? Well, I'm from Sydney, and I've been wanting an app like this for forever.

NextBus is okay, but I thought making an app that's easier to use would be fun, and maybe I'll be able to get it going in other places.

(Side note: In a move that should make you appreciate Translink, Sydney Buses installed gps trackers in all their buses, made the data available for a few days.... then pulled it when someone made an app using it. That was over a year ago, go Sydney!)

Just spent the last 10 days in your beautiful province. I was in downtown mostly but also spent time in Surrey, Richmond and Prince George (don't ask). 

But I gotta say I love it out here. People are great, food is awesome, women are gorgeous, night life is fun.

While I was here I partied like an unpopular rockstar, went to the Canucks home opener and smoked a very questionable joint that contained a cocktail of substances.

But FUCK YOU for keeping Whitespot all to yourself, I want that shit in Toronto, someone do something quick.

Anyway, stuck at the airport as my flight is delayed as some asshole  clogged the airplane bathroom on the flight before mine and disturbed some shit. Now we wait. 

Thanks Vancouver, your mountainous terrain, your aggressive cougars and your commitment to intoxication.  I will be back soon.


EDIT: Thanks for the love people. Yea about the joint. I was smashed off my face trying to find bud. I found a guy who sold me a pre rolled J so I bought it and smoked it. My buddy took a toke and asked the guy what was in it, his response ""Weed, shrooms, everything.""

The food was okay and the drinks weren't too pricey. That being said, the confusion at the end when it came time to paying the bill was a little off putting, but that could've been just because we were in a big group.

I WILL say, if you're going there expecting some sort of chuckie-cheese with video games featuring booze you'll be disappointed. I was really looking forward to playing some video games and having a few rounds, but instead I got feeds of starcraft and no video games. Which was a bummer.

The all ages thing really curbs the mood. One of the waiters there was even telling me they have to be really choosy even about the music that they play because of this, which I thought was especially weird. Maybe it was just the eve of st. paddys and I was just looking to get recklessly drunk.

The owner was there, which I thought was cool, hes a nice guy and we had a rant about mass effect before I left, which totally redeemed everything. lol.

They really gotta work on the video games thing though, because until that issue is resolved, they're just another restaurant downtown, imo. 


EDIT: Signed the petition someone posted. After reading more in depth about the travesty they're going through, I feel sorry for them and anyone stuck in that stupid position, Vancouver's laws pertaining to anything social are archaic and stupid. I hope a newspaper gets wind of this fight and the story is brought to a wider audience. 

EDIT: I sort of get the impression that if they went the route of a liquor primary place things might have been a little easier for them. Is it a far stretch to say theres plenty of places that have the digital slots / booze bar and it works out? I think them going for an ""all ages"" venue complicates the whole thing, they want booze, video games and kids in there, thats bound to be a disaster. You can't have your cake, and eat it too. Then again, maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about. Perhaps the owner thought that making it ""all ages"" means he'll turn more of a profit with the kids in there spending money.

1365009117.0,95,self.vancouver,1bljwc,"Car broken into, wallet stolen, mailbox broken into, identity theft attempt by the same asian couple. Everything on video. Seeking advice.",shaozhen,113,18,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1bljwc/car_broken_into_wallet_stolen_mailbox_broken_into/,"Last month, on a Wednesday night, my gf and I were eating at a restaurant very late at night. We went back our car, and someone had smashed my window and stolen her wallet. Over the next few days, she would cry a lot in regret of leaving a wallet in the front seat. We stayed up all night calling credit card companies, banks, etc.

But we let it go.

I paid the 300 deductible to get my window fixed, and we went on with our busy lives.

The next Wednesday, I got home and my manager called me to the video room, and showed me a video of an asian couple getting into my building, and going straight for my mailbox (1 out of maybe 50 in the building). My gf sees the video the next day, and immediately identifies them as people she saw at the restaurant a week ago.

We go to the restaurant, and ask the manager nicely for the video tapes from that night. You can even see them breaking into my car on the video.

RCMP says they can't do anything about it. The officer now has both the tapes from the restaurant and my strata. I have the tapes from the restaurant but only has seen the footage from the strata. Strata company refuses to give it to me, which is their prerogative.

Nothing has been done. I spoke to a few different constables and they basically said that even if they go public, people will refuse to ID them. Asked us not to do anything.

They also told us that we shouldn't expect anything to happen. Even if they're caught, we won't get any reimbursements for the mailbox, the deductible, the replacements costs for her wallet.

It has been 3 weeks now.

I have so much details about it all. Video tapes, pictures.

What do I do??

EDIT: Just to vent a little: the most frustrating thing about this is that their faces are on camera perfectly. Their faces are so distinctive I could pick them out from a line up of a million people. And yet the police are telling me they most likely won't be able to ID them.

And guess what time they waltzed into my building to break into the mail box? 3pm.

EDIT2: http://i.imgur.com/ZuxxQsX.jpg

EDIT3: So I just spoke with my gf, and we've decided to
1. speak to our case officer and let him know that we're not satisfied with the way/speed things are being handled by the RCMP and give him a heads up that we want to speak to a lawyer even if it's at our cost
2. speak to a lawyer about possible action to get the strata to give us the tape
3. ask the lawyer if we would be in the wrong if we went to the media
4. go to the media with the story and if we feel it's appropriate, release the tape.

If and when we release the tape, it'll be on this subreddit for sure. My most sincere thanks to r/vancouver. This is (I think) the second time I posted on this subreddit and both times the discussion here has actually changed my mind about how to go about things.",,False,self,t5_2qhov,1365026149.0,,,True,t3_1bljwc,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1bljwc/car_broken_into_wallet_stolen_mailbox_broken_into/,

He acted super threatening, tried to get close to me (thank you video games for teaching me not to let a guy with a sword get into melee range) when I booked it, ran a few blocks back and forth to lose him, got to the 7-11 and called the cops. After talking to the police, apparently this individual has a history of doing exactly this, and has threatened a number of people on multiple occasions in the neighbourhood.

So just a heads up, if you live in the South Hill / Sunset / South Van area and are walking late at night / early in the morning, and see a guy with what appears to be a sword, it might be this guy and your best bet is to gtfo of there.

I don't get any karma from this!

I can't believe I didn't think to post something here earlier. On January 7th, my car was broken into while I was on vacation. It was parked outside my buddy's house in Coquitlam. The assholes (and I assume it was plural, because they took a lot of other stuff, too) made off with my hockey bag, which I'd actually totally forgotten I'd left in there.

I've been scouring Craigslist since then, but haven't had any luck, so if any of you know anyone who recently mysteriously acquired a whole bunch of new gear, or see anyone trying to sell gear matching the list below, please, **please** let me know.

- Winnwell wheeled bag
- CCM helmet w/ Bauer half-visor
- CCM skates, size 9
- Bauer One35 shoulder pads
- Bauer elbow pads
- Easton gloves
- Black RBK practice jersey
- Capitals Ovechkin WC jersey that's missing the patch
- Pair of red + blue + white stripes

Don't recall what my pants were, but I **think** my shin guards were Easton. I don't know if I'm not thinking of my old pair, though, so don't put a high priority on that. I probably had another jersey in there, and definitely had a second pair of socks. Jock shorts, stick tape, mouthguard, the usual. I've only used it all maybe a dozen times, so the gear is in pretty good condition.

The assholes also made off with my fiancée's longboard, which is like [this](http://www.muirskate.com/uploads/products/7481/main_Honey_42_Inch_Carver_Pin_Longboard_Skateboard_Decks.png), with green wheels. She's pretty devastated about this one, because it was my first Christmas present to her.

Again, this is a total longshot, but hopefully one of you awesome folks could help me.

**Edit:** Now, in the event that you know who it was and they're your friend so you don't want to rat them out, I'm gonna extend the olive branch here and tell you that I don't plan to press any charges/pursue any legal avenues as long as I get EVERYTHING that was stolen back.",,False,self,t5_2qhov,1359706650.0,,,True,t3_17nqje,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/17nqje/car_got_broken_into_and_thieves_made_off_with_a/,

Would preferably like to go on like the 29th (As I'm going to see The Weeknd that evening and if I could cram it all into one day, that'd be pretty sweet), but I should be flexible.

Some information about me,

Male. 18, 19 this December. Currently attending Douglas College for criminology for 2 years, then transferring SFU to finish off the degree. Into all sorts of music, mainly hip hop right now. Socially awkward a bit, but improving. 

So yeah, if anyone would like to join me, feel free to leave a message here or shoot me a PM, I don't really care about gender, or age or anything like that, ent or non ent. Just preferably someone who isn't a serial killer or planning on becoming one.

***[Follow up Thread is here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/hzj1s/alright_rvancouver_global_reddit_meetup_day_and/)***

*** The official page is [Here](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/vancouver-meetup/)!*** You can RSVP on it too. The time and location are not officially set but for now I just put Spanish Banks. NOTE: there is another event already made but it has nothing to do with this thread, at least from what I understand. I have contacted the creator to see if we could collaborate. 

Okay so here are the main suggestions so far --- since there are quite a bit of redditors not 19 yet, we are keeping it all ages so everyone can be included (=  

* Have a bbq at a beach or park. Hopefully it will be warm and sunny and it would be a shame if we spent the day indoors on a nice day. Spanish Banks seems like a great place to hang out. This seems like the best idea now.

* Go to a pub/bar. This is ideal if the weather will not favour outdoor events. A lot of people have recommended Steamworks. Apparently its all ages so that's a bonus, but you'll still need to be 19 to drink anything alcoholic =P (This isn't ideal for redditors under the age of 19 so something else might need to be planned)

So please feel free to add more suggestions! This looks very promising right now. Closer to the event, we can have a vote on exactly where and what we will do. 

NOTE: please remember reddiquette, don't down-vote if you disagree with someone, simply post your opinion and upvote what you support. Thanks!

**EDIT!** Starting an RSVP [comment post](http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/h89jq/who_is_interested_in_holding_a_reddit_meetup_for/c1tfzhh) in this thread since doing it on the meetup page is quite a hassle.

I wasn't sure what I was going to think of it, but I think I covered all the major highlights in less than 48 hours (easy to do when traveling alone). Some of my favorites: the Chinese Gardens, the downtown library, St. Augustine's (awesome display of keg fullness!) on Commercial, Bao Bei for modern Chinese, the walk down Davie and across the Granville Bridge into the public market, East Hastings Street @ Main (really puts the Godspeed! song into perspective . . . ), Alibi Room for brunch and amazing BC beer, and of course the fireworks show (what a surprise!)--though I wasn't out to meet a ton of people, those that I ran into at the bars were extremely helpful and friendly! Oh, and not seeing 3/4 of the population droning to their smart phones was a nice change!

Oh--and thanks to the Redditer who recommended VIVO. I hit up the animation installation/performance and had fun. If any of y'all come down to Seattle, hit me up and I'll show you around.

We checked into the hotel and decided to go out for a walk to find something for lunch, but our walk was cut short by a Canada Day parade (just about any parade with Vader and Storm troopers is okay to me)

It didn't take long for me to notice a few things about Vancouver:

* you like bicycles
* you like dogs
* you like coffee
* you like gelato
* you really hate cars, parking, and turn lanes

We did one of those hop-on/hop-off trolly's and got to see quite a bit of the city; places like Stanley Park, Granville Island, and Gastown were incredible to just walk around, we even made our way up to the Capilano suspension bridge.

There was a nice food selection; the Beaver and the Mullet near Denman and Davie made a good grilled cheese and fantastic mac 'n cheese. Just a bit to the south we had some amazing fish and chips at The Boat House. On the flip side, just north of the Beaver and Mullet, the cupcakes, the schwarma, and the philo were nothing special, as was the Old Spaghetti Factory in Gastown. We grabbed a few burgers at Nimby Burger and went across the street to the Kitsilano beach/park to enjoy the beautiful weather. There was another really good burger place, which I am pretty sure was on ~~Granville St~~ nope, ~~don't remember the name~~ Romer's, the burgers were pretty good but service was a bit lacking (Romer's Burger Bar on 4th, between Cypress and Burard)). I even managed to get to Mom's Grilled Cheese truck, which was exceptional. The best stop, by far, was for gelato (which there are plenty of options) from Bella Gelateria (a short walk from Canada Place).

Anyways, it was a fantastic trip and I look forward to going back again.",,False,self,t5_2qhov,1342466705.0,,,True,t3_wneju,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/wneju/thank_you_vancouver/,

It is usually found in children, and is so rare, the BC Cancer Society has never even treated it at this late stage. This is an inoperable tumour, and has taken root where her spinal nerves connect to her brainstem. She is currently undergoing radiation therapy, along with a host of other treatments to slow it's growth, but it might be necessary for her to seek treatment outside the country. 

To this end, her wonderful friends (and all of their friends) are organizing a car wash and bottle drive in the parking lot at the corner of Hastings and Renfrew, real estate which has been generously donated to this cause. It all goes down this Saturday, July 21st from 11am-5pm. This will be a family friendly affair, with local firefighters with fire hats for children, face-painting, balloon animals, a lemonade stand, a local DJ providing music, and a raffle. Come on down, bring your empty bottles and cans, get your car washed and help contribute to this worthy cause.

I'm fairly new to reddit as a whole, and fresh as green grass to this subreddit, and was hoping to get the word out to the relevant community.

After a perfect move out inspection with the building manager I was told that I would receive my $475 damage deposit in the mail at the forwarding address I had provided.

After not receiving the deposit back after a month and a half I called the building manager and received a phone number for the ""head office"". I tried calling the number probably 15 times over 1 month and all I got was voicemail that was full so I couldn't even leave a message.

Then began the long and somewhat complicated process of trying to get my deposit back which included:

* Filing a case with the Residential Tenancy Branch ($50)
* Winning the case (which was a conference call that the land lord didn't bother calling in for) for $1000
* Having the official order for $1000 ignored by the land lord
* Performing a company records search ($44.80)
* Filing my $1000 order with the small claims court ($21)
* Serving 4 copies of the Payment Hearing court documents on the defendants ($168)
* Receiving a certified cheque for $1145.80 at the Payment Hearing with an additional $43.20 to me mailed to me
* Finally receiving the cheque for $43.20 in the mail today to put this issue to rest.

Finally receiving my money after going through this process is a relief but the process really shouldn't take this long or be as complicated as it is. I ended up spending many hours of my time serving documents, attending hearings, going to court, and constantly trying to figure out what the next steps would be.

As the title stated, I'm looking to get engaged. It's been discussed thoroughly and is pretty much a done deal at this point; all I need now is to perform the proposal. This is what I need one person to help with.

I would like someone to meet me at a train station downtown, ask if we are ""jumbopoutine and (girl's name)"", and then hand me a picnic basket that I will have given to you 5-10 minutes earlier. That's it. It should take about 10 minutes of waiting, and whatever travel time the person requires. I don't have a lot of money, but I'd be happy to give $20 for the help.

The ring will be in the basket, but it's from Value Village and cost $7, so please don't be too tempted to run off with it. It's more symbolic than anything.  I'm planning to do this either tomorrow or next weekend. Most likely tomorrow, if nothing comes up. The meeting would take place shortly after 3:00pm.

Would anyone be able to help me with this? Thank you.

tl;dr: I would like someone to hand me a basket at 3:00pm tomorrow, at a downtown train station. You will be given $20. There is a minor speaking role involved.

Edit: Thank you again to everyone who so kindly offered to help, and everyone else too, for that matter. I believe it will be taking place tomorrow, and I have found someone to help. Sorry to those whom I did not reply to. You all seemed kind and friendly, and I assure you it was nothing personal. I can post an update tomorrow describing how it went, and I'll try to, but don't expect anything too exciting :P

Edit 2: It's done! It went ok. No, no, it went very well. The fellow who helped me did a great job, and it went off without a hitch. She accepted, and was pretty floored by the whole thing. She was a bit suspicious about the mysterious package delivery (which was a bag, since apparently stores don't sell picnic baskets in winter), but the suspicion did not detract from the experience.

You've all been very kind, so I'll give some details about the proposal. Basically, she loves food, fairy tales, mysteries, and the water. So, inside the basket of food I placed some handwritten notes from ""The Picnic Wizard"", giving his history and explaining how he bestows picnic baskets upon special, worthy couples. It's a bit sappy, of course, but works well for the situation. We took the basket to the sea wall, ate the food, and after dessert I opened a small gift box from the wizard, which included a ring and a note which told me to give it to her, so that we may continue to spread and grow the magic of happiness and picnics.

It was fun, and she was glowing with excitement. She was also amazed at how helpful and supportive the Vancouver subreddit was. So, thank you to all of you, and to my excellent helper in particular, for making it a great afternoon and an extremely memorable experience :)

Here's a few screen-shots for interest's sake:

[Overlay compared with no overlay](http://i.imgur.com/KUpOs.jpg) - Notice the size of False Creek. Most of it was filled ~~by the 1940s~~ during WW I for the rail yards ~~, but it had been steadily being filled for fifty years or so~~. Granville Island was originally a huge sandbar, and Lost Lagoon was part of Coal Harbour.

[Overlay with major roads for reference](http://i.imgur.com/2HhCh.jpg) - The two surviving water features of Vancouver are Trout Lake (middle bottom) and Beaver Lake (top left). All of Vancouver's original rivers have been buried as part of the sewer system, but there's considerable political will to daylight portions of some of them.

[Detail, East Vancouver](http://i.imgur.com/xoDwo.jpg) - The eastern portion of False Creek is visible in the top left. This has been completely filled and runs from Clarke to Main. In the bottom left there's a huge beaver dam complex that fills the Kingsway/Main triangle. Trout Lake sits in a bog in the middle bottom, and the right contains a portion of the huge Still Creek watershed. The westernmost portion of this was a series of beaver dams, and most of the Still Creek valley (now containing Grandview Highway and Rona, MacDonalds, Superstore, the Brick, and all the other warehouses) was a vast cranberry bog. Large portions of Still Creek have been daylighted, and I noticed that at least one of the trees beside it has been chewed on by beavers.

**EDIT** - Thanks for the kind remarks and additional resources provided. I'm trying to figure out how to bundle multiple overlays as well as location tags, as well as clean up several areas of the map (the eastern portion of False Creek, making several streams more visible, and fixing the mouth of China Creek), then I'll publish it. 

**EDIT 2** - oops, screwed up on when East False Creek was filled in. Fixed.",,False,self,t5_2qhov,True,,,True,t3_f2dda,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/f2dda/vancouver_in_google_earth_as_it_originally_looked/,

As promised, here are some of our pics from the proposal. She was completely surprised and said YES!!! She was wondering why a random person was taking pics of us (ebags) but the others were quite sly and she did not even notice they were taking photos of us! All in all, it went very well and we couldn't be happier! :)

Special thanks to SadClownFish, ebays, Redsmurf1, and one other redditor which I haven't been able to figure out their username, for coming out and sharing and helping capture our special moment. 

Lastly, thank you /Vancouver for the great suggestions!! You guys are super nice and wonderful!!

**TIME CHANGE** BBQ will start at 2:30 pm. 

Do you have children? BRING THEM!
Do you have dogs? OMG YES, BRING THEM!
Do you have a BBQ? YA MAYBE BRING THAT TOO, OURS IS SMALL!
Do you like to listen to coldplay? GET OUT. OK, PARADISE IS ALRIGHT.

About two weeks ago my brother in law called and told us about a new place that opened in Vancouver. After discussing it briefly, I decided to give it a try even though I suffer from claustrophobia. This morning I spent approximately 80 minutes in the ""float tank"", which is a much more friendly sounding name than ""sensory deprivation tank"" or ""isolation tank"".

The process was pretty straightforward; after missing my first appointment due to a surprise meeting, I showed up this morning at 7:45 for my appointment. On arrival I signed the typical ""if something goes horribly wrong, we weren't responsible"" waiver (this is not unusual, if you have visited any treatment place, such as chiropractic, massage, or physiotherapy, they get you to sign similar forms). You are strongly encouraged to use the rest-room, then take a shower at a neutral temperature to clean yourself before entering the tank. Entering the tank was super simple, and there is no clasp or lock on the door (to be honest, if there was, I may not have been able to get in). I didn't get the dimensions of the tank, but I expect that it is approximately 8 feet in length, and 3-4 feet in height as I could stretch my arms or my legs lying down, but not both, and I could sit up comfortably in the tank.

Entering the tank was interesting because with one foot in the water, it felt as natural as stepping into a pool or bath, but after the second foot was in, I could immediately sense the buoyancy provided by the saltwater. After spending a couple of moments getting used to the fact that I was lying in the tank, I closed the door. It was completely dark in the chamber, but I could hear more than I expected, with the combination of the ear plugs, and being in a closed space, inside of a much larger facility. I waited a few minutes to make sure I was actually hearing sounds and that they weren't 'ghost' sounds that my mind was filling in because of the lack of noise, then lay down in the water again. It took me a couple of minutes to get comfortable with the buoyancy, but I can't clearly speak to how long because my sense of time was completely gone yfairly quickly. It was really interesting to experiment with how I could move in the water in a different way, for example, stretching out the way I do in bed, or actually relaxing my neck and allowing the surface of the water to form a pillow around my head.

There was another thing I noticed fairly quickly too. Despite living in an area of the world best describe as a temperate rain forest that gets it's share of rain, and everyone else share as well, I am constantly dry and dehydrated. As a result, my skin is frequently dry to the point of cracking, especially on my hands(I haven't been diagnosed with any issues, and it is not irritating enough to invest significant time or effort beyond skin lotion). Seconds after entering the water I felt a slight sting in every scrape, scratch and crack in my skin (there are afew as I have been doing yard work and other stuff). It didn't hurt, but it was definitely noticeable. It subsided after a few minutes, and was overall, probably better for my skin.

I was alone with my thoughts and feelings and eventually my awareness of my senses was altered as well. As with any environment, my senses began to adjust; I was able to focus on the sounds and feelings my body makes, including a regular clicking in my foot when it moved. I never noticed it before, but it became cringe-worthy after hearing it a few times. I made a mental note to get things in my foot checked out, and then tried to avoid moving my foot to prevent the distraction.

Some time into it, my leg muscle started spasming, which had the side effect of making me drift. The staff member helping me had explained that drifting can turn into a game of ping pong as you drift and deflect off of walls. So I did that for a few minutes, and was completely surprised a couple of times because I had the sensation of moving in one direction and would be drifting the opposite way. When that got boring I stabilized my self and settled for awhile.

After about 80 minutes I realized that I was finished, largely due to an overwhelming need to go to the washroom (listening to water has that effect on me :P). I climbed out, and against the advice of the tech, got some salt water in my eyes. In the Caribbean ocean the salt water feels pretty good. In an isolation tank, not so much. No harm done, but the stinging took about a minute to subside.

Fast forward 9 hours to when I am writing this post, and I feel like I have had a hard massage, and feel quite drained on top of it. Despite having a good shower after the fact, I had a nice coating of salt (I assume stuff that was absorbed into the pores). Overall, the experience was very good, and left me feeling extremely relaxed.

Since having done the float, I have had the chance to read up some more on the proposed health benefits of this activity, but I will leave others to do their own research. I will definitely try it again a couple of more times before I make decision on whether or not I think it is worth adding to the list of activities (or inactivities) that I partake in as part of destressing.

*edit - put the tldr at the top of the wall of text.

A note on fear and confrontation: I have a few phobias, none of which are crippling. Most are an annoyance, but I have tackled each one in turn, heights, crowds, spiders (I might be the only appsec person who hates spiders :P). Claustrophobia is a bad one for me. I won't go into the reasons why, but I don't like being in closed spaces, and even meeting rooms, or being in a room where there is a person blocking the exit is very disconcerting. Performing this activity is part of my ongoing effort to challenge myself to overcome fears and understand why I fear. I don't recommend this as a regular course of activity for anyone who suffers from claustrophobia because this helped me understand that my fear of being confined has less to do with the space and more to do with feeling trapped or contained.

1314295260.0,68,self.vancouver,ju8ta,Bus etiquette,airchinapilot,94,26,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/ju8ta/bus_etiquette/,"There was a recent thread on umbrella etiquette and now that people are coming back from vacation and going to school and work, let's refresh some nice things to remember when you are on the bus or train, shall we? Any more additions I will add to the list.

1. Take that fucking backpack off your back. You don't realize it but you are bashing everyone in the face when you turn around and you are taking up more than one person's space. Ladies with your oversized chichi handbag, I know that cost you a lot of money but you are still wacking seated people in the face when you swing it around on your shoulder. 
2. Good hygiene is good. **EDIT** *I have heard the points from people working in construction. I have worked in a warehouse before. I was not referring to you but understand. Also people who just came from the beach, recreation, okay fine. Better?*
3. Those seats up near the front? Give them up for people who need them. Old people, people with disabilities, pregnant women, really dangerous mentally ill people -- give them two seats. 
4. That space around the rear exits. Don't block that fucking space. I know it's a pain when you think you just need to stay there for two stops or whatever, but some of you just park there and don't fill up the rear of the bus so no one can get on. Keep moving to the back. 
5. Headphones  / earphones -- are meant to be heard in silence. If I can hear the words of the song, that's not how it's meant to work. Besides, you are damaging your hearing. I know you think hearing is useless when you're older but it doesn't have to be that way. I don't want to hear your bad taste in music either.
6. Umbrellas -- don't drip it on me. Put it on the floor or at least hold onto it lower. **EDIT** Don't put wet things on the seats! People have to sit there!
7. That seat next to you is for a human being, not for your possession's comfort. If it will fit on your lap, put it on your lap. 
8. If you are going to grope your friend in front of me, don't get annoyed if I start videoing it. You decided to put on the show so if you wanted to charge money you need to put a box around it first. On the bus, it's fair game. 
9. Lady with the big fruit basket on your head. Keep on rocking that. I don't mind. 
10. iPads -- don't look at your fucking hentai. That shit is open where everyone can see it and I don't want to see your greasy tentacle rape fantasy before I've had my coffee. 
11. Lady who was making her sandwich on her lap: don't wipe your greasy hands on the pole. Better yet, make your sandwich some place that isn't moving. 
12. Perverts. You've seen them. Report them. Use the phone. 
13. Advice. You know the bus routes, share your knowledge when someone asks where. Be good to visitors. 
14. Phones and loud talkers. I give up, really. 
15. Bus drivers. Be nice to them.
16. You have an awful cold: Use the tissues, sneeze into your arm, stay home, just keep your cold virus away from everyone else. 
17. Mommies with strollers. If your kid can stand or sit, you need to take up less space, especially if your stroller can be collapsed. And especially if you are denying some guy in a wheelchair the same space. That guy in the wheelchair has no choice, you do. Give up that space or take the next bus.
18. **added** You don't want to sit at the window? Okay, but if you are taking up the inner seat move aside when someone wants to take up that outer seat. Sorry you have to take transit but yes, that means sometimes you have to sit beside another human being. 
19. **added** Have your fare ready. Especially with the rainy months about to happen, no one wants to line up in the rain for the bus and wait for you to count your nickels.
20.  **added**  Know when you're getting off and plan accordingly. In other words, if the bus is pretty fully and you're getting off in one stop, start heading towards the doors. Not only do you free up a seat for someone standing but you won't have to do the mad last-minute scramble that leaves you either shoving other people or not getting to the doors on time.
21.  **added** Don't clip your fucking nails on the fucking bus. It is never, ever okay. Ever. EVER. I fucking mean it.
22.  **added** Skytrain: Don't block doors when people are trying to get off. If you're on the train and by the doors, step out to make more room for exiting passengers. If you're trying to get on, wait to the side before finding somewhere to stand. And move as far back as possible.
23.   **added** If you're sitting in the back in those 2 by 2 seats which face each other, don't put your feet up on the opposite chairs- and sit up and move your legs back when people want to sit opposite. **EDIT**  Sorry, tall people, do what you can. 
24.   **added** Standing room only and your friend gets a seat upfront- OK, you can stand up front with them, but get out of the way when ppl get on so you don't clog up the corridor and stop people from moving down to the back.
25. **added** If you leave trash on the bus, someone else has to sit in it, stand on it. Worst. Your half drunk Starbucks cup is rolling all over the place. There are garbage cans all over the place. Use them!
26. **added** if I'm sitting next to the window and you're sitting next to me, and I pull the stop line thingy, it means I wanna get off. If I stand up, I wanna get off. It would be nice if you moved, if you don't want me to shove my ass in your face.
27. **added** Do not block the exit. Stand to the side and let people off before trying to cram yourself on board. Yes, you're in a hurry to get on, but by blocking the exit and trying to push your way in, you are actually slowing things down, and making it more likely that a) someone gets trapped on the bus/train and misses their stop and b) someone behind you doesn't make it on because the doors closed on them.
28. **added** If you need to put your bike on the bike rack at the front and it's empty put it in the back one first. It's a lot easier to get a bike off from this position then get one on if there is a bike in the front space.
29. **added** Do not hold the SkyTrain doors open for more than 6 attempts, or the train will stall and you'll hold up the whole system while an attendant has to be sent to manually ensure there's no dead person keeping the doors from closing.
30. **added** Don't bug the service dogs. They are cute but they are working.

My Mom sells corn in Surrey at the Husky Station on Scott Road and about 75th-76th. She gets it fresh from the farm right in the morning and drives it into Surrey every.single.morning. All summer long for two-three months. It's picked by hand by a local farmer, and it's honestly the best corn that we've ever had. She's been at this spot for five years, so stop by for a friendly chat with the corn lady named Gloria.

Tell her where you read this post so she knows the word about supporting local farmers is getting out there! 

Thanks everyone and have a great summer! 

Prices are two dollars more per dozen than out in Chilliwack, and heck I can't drive out to Chilliwack for two dollars and get it that fresh! Plus it's never sold day old, so it's guaranteed picked that morning. 

Look for the signs, the umbrellas, and the big red truck!

The person they hit was a super clean cut 40ish year old man in a blue jacket. I called the non-emerg line. Will anything even happen to these people? People like that should NOT be on the road.  

It's really bothering me that the cyclist was so jaded by the lack of  interest he perceives on part of the police that he just drove off.  It seems ridiculous that those people will now possibly just be able to continue on with no consequence for HITTING A HUMAN BEING WITH THEIR CAR. 

Update: The police called me back and said the best they could do is give me the number to ICBC to name myself as a witness in the event that the person who got hit contacts them and is looking for one.

1319155956.0,66,self.vancouver,ljbxp,Lost our dog in Lynn Valley last night :(,vancookalex,70,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/ljbxp/lost_our_dog_in_lynn_valley_last_night/,"Hey r/vancouver, I was hoping to get the word out as much as I could about our (recently adopted) lost dog, Betty.

We were at a house with a fenced-in yard in North Van, around Mountain Hwy and Arborlynn, when she jumped onto a retaining wall and ran down a ravine. After trying to follow her, we went on a hunt until it was too dark. We've followed all the necessary steps, including calling the local shelters, vets, RCMP and animal control. Today, we've gone around putting up posters and handed them out, making sure to go door to door and hitting the trails in the area. 

Betty's a 1.5 year old greyhound cross, about 75 lbs, with a brindle (tiger-ish) coat, with white around her neck, chest and legs. She has a black collar on with our phone numbers attached. She's very shy, so she might be difficult to approach. If you spot her, please let me know through e-mail at vancookalex@gmail.com. 

Here's a decent picture of her:
http://i.imgur.com/rpliv.jpg

Let me know if there is anything else I could pursue! Thanks...

EDIT: Thank you for the offers of help so far! Here is the link to the poster we've been using: http://www.scribd.com/doc/69675371/Betty-Lost

EDIT 2: We now have a tracker helping us tomorrow morning! He's got a bloodhound who has experience in tracking other animals. I'll let you guys know how it goes.

UPDATE: We've now met with the tracker from Petsearchers Canada. Brought his bloodhound Jed, and he's driving around to get an idea of the search area. Brought some stuff with Betty's scent on it for Jed to smell. We may not go with him, as he's had bad luck with owners insisting their pet will respond to them, and they end up complicating things further. So we wait, for now. 

UPDATE 2: Just got a tip from someone who saw her last night around Mountain Highway and Doran, specifically Dyck. It's a bit further up, and getting closer to the mountain!

UPDATE 3: We waited all day for the tracker to come back, and he didn't, even after trying to get in contact with him. Kind of weird. Then, this morning, he sent an email to our adoption coordinator (who got us in touch with this guy) telling her that he spent around 6 hours searching in the northern part of Mountain Highway, to no avail. He recommended a different type of poster be put up, fluorescent with a laser printout of Betty's picture, and writing in jumbo marker. I have to work today, but my girlfriend will be out putting them up in the area around Mountain Highway and Dyck/Doran/Kilmer, etc. Betty apparently wasn't around in the southern part of the highway near Arborlynn.

UPDATE 4: Got 2 tips last night, both within minutes of each other. Betty was down around Birchlynn and Arborlynn, close to where we originally lost her. Unfortunately the area that she ended up heading down is straight brush, filled with bramble bushes and a big drop down to the creek bed, but it may be possible to take one of the trails down there and follow the creek down, which we're going to attempt today!

Here's a map of the area we now believe she's around, thanks to a couple more tips we've received:
