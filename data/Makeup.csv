1363101287.0,30,self.Makeup,1a5fc7,Saw an album of porn stars' before and after makeup that made me question my makeup-applying abilities. Need help figuring out what I'm doing wrong! [Link below] (x-post r/MakeupAddiction),Oh_My_Sagan,38,8,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/1a5fc7/saw_an_album_of_porn_stars_before_and_after/,"So if you haven't seen it, [here](http://imgur.com/a/ynkv8) is the album in question. It blew me away. It's essentially photos of dozens upon dozens of porn stars, pre- and post-makeup. It's mostly their faces and clothed upper bodies, for those of you who may be browsing in public/at work.

After looking at what these women [and their makeup artists] can do, I think my routine needs some fine-tuning.  A little about me: age twenty, very fair skin, some freckles, dark brown/reddish hair, green eyes [pupils are often freakishly large, so my eyes look dark a lot of the time...?], thick eyebrows.

Here's what I look like today: [1](http://imgur.com/h0znF2e) [2](http://imgur.com/2bO0OO7) [3](http://imgur.com/UiF8U6l) [only have on light concealer and mascara]

My makeup routine usually consists of:

1. Maybelline Fit Me concealer on the bridge of my nose, which can get very red, and on red spots [dabbed on with my finger]

2. brush on Bare Minerals powder, but it's usually pretty much gone by the end of the day  :/

3. mascara on upper lashes

4. I just bought a brown eyebrow pencil that I've been experimenting with, but I have no idea what my brows should even look like since they're so full anyways

5. sometimes I add a little eyeliner and shadow, but it's usually under-done and it definitely doesn't make my eyes *pop*

6. I will also occasionally put on chapstick or lipstick [I only have two! a red one and a very sheer brown one]

So as for the photos, I'm specifically talking about:

* skin in general - how do they get it so clean and smooth and even? They covered up blotchiness and spots and all! I recognize that this type of makeup is for shooting movies, so the makeup has to be heavier in general, but there must be a way to apply makeup like this for everyday wear, no?

* eyebrows - how did some of them go from having sparse/no eyebrow hair to having perfectly-arched brows, while still remaining to look natural/non-clown-like?

* eye makeup - how do you apply eyeliner like that?! Like I said, I tend to under-do my eye shadow and eyes in general since I'm afraid of overdoing it. Any favorite tutorials or beauty graphics I should know about?

* glow - is there a way to make my skin glow like that without looking shiny or using Photoshop [which I don't think they were]?

* any other tips/tutorials you'd like to share? How do I pull any of this off without overdoing it?!

* a few favorite looks: Rilee Marks, Chanel Preston, Proxy Paige, Tori Black, Aria Amor, Liz Ashley, Asphyxia Noir, Sierra Cure, Penny Pax, Sally Sparrow.... wow, there are a lot on here, but hopefully you get the idea!

ANY and ALL help would be appreciated! I'm going to keep browsing this awesome subreddit for more tips. Sorry for typing so much - I tried to break it up so it wasn't one huge wall of text  :]",,False,self,t5_2qrwc,False,,,True,t3_1a5fc7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/1a5fc7/saw_an_album_of_porn_stars_before_and_after/,

So now I just use a brush but yesterday I was yelled at by co workers saying I don't do it properly and blah blah. I was to embarrassed to ask them and don't really have anyone else I could really ask. Am I supposed to apply lotion or primer or something else and not just foundation?

I tried the Sephora + Pantone Color IQ foundation matching tool yesterday,nicolereviews,26,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/xysq5/hey_rmakeup_i_tried_the_sephora_pantone_color_iq/,"Hey r/makeup! I tried the Sephora + Pantone Color IQ Foundation Matching Tool in San Francisco yesterday, which promises to end the frustration of selecting a foundation shade. I was really interested to see how it works and I am happy to say that this system is as amazing as it sounds.

A Sephora technician presses a handheld tool to 3 areas of your skin and finds the average of the 3 shades. The average is called your Pantone Skintone Number. You enter your number into an iPad and view all of the shades that match your skintone. You can filter your results by preferences such as skin type, foundation formula (liquid, powder, TM, etc). After that, the Sephora employee will apply some of your foundation matches to your skin to see what you think.

I got matched up to Clinique Superbalanced Makeup in Nude Beige and I was so impressed with the result. It wasn't really a color that I would have picked out myself, but it looked much more healthy and natural on my skin than the shade I was wearing when I came in (oops). 

I was so excited when I left the store. Sephora + Pantone Color IQ is super fun and effective. It's currently only available at the Sephora stores in NYC Times Square and SF Powell St, but they have plans to launch in more stores in the Fall.

The technician gave me a lot more information about the system so let me know if you have any questions.

I have more details about the process (and sneaky cell phone pics of the devices) here: http://www.nicolereviewsbeauty.com/2012/08/does-sephora-pantone-color-iq-actually.html

I spoke to my doctor about this and she kind of convinced me that allot of men on tv wear makeup etc and it's ok.

So anyway she said that it's important to match your skin tone (I have olive skin I have been told) but other than this I have no idea where to begin.

I have a job interview on Monday and would love to cover my dark circles for that.

Questions I have which I would be so grateful if you could help (I'm not really comfortable asking the ladies in my life ATM).

Can I go the makeup section of a shop and get someone to help? Will they help match skin color? Is there shops that only sell makeup? I really have no idea...

If I chicken out of going to the shop. What do I need to order from the Internet? Considering i have no equipment (ie no brushes etc) nothing....

How do apply the makeup to conceal under my eyes? Will it be noticable considering I will need allot and I only will be wearing it under my eyes?

Thanks in advance for your help :)

**edit**

Thanks so much everyone for your kind replies and helpful advice.
I'm just going to buy every product mentioned ( like ~$200 worth ) and spend some time analyzing the tutorials and advice to see what works best for me.

On the back is a zippered pocket, and a little hanging strap. I hang mine on an over the door coat rack in my bathroom- but it's also great when you're out and about.

She wants to wear it, but she has a really hard time applying it with a pencil (she feels she has to push too hard).  She recently got a cream one but she can't apply it evenly and she's very unhappy with it.  She also hates how hard it is to wash off at bedtime.  

I thought maybe I could try to get her something she'd be comfortable with, as this is something that bothers her semi-frequently.  Should I get her something like [this](http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P35082), as advised in another thread, or will that be too hard for her to wash off?
Also, should I get her black eyeliner?  I have no idea!  Here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/B5XQM.jpg) to give an idea of her complexion/hair.

I don't dabble in make up at all, but I wanted to see if I could get some anonymous help from the makeup experts over here. 

Ever since I was a kid I've always had really bad dark circles under my eyes. I'm pretty sure they are hereditary/caused by thin skin; they don't ever go away. You can cross out the suggestions of getting more sleep, drinking lots of water, and even cucumbers--the dark areas persist. 

So I figure that since I'm stuck with them, and they really bother me appearance wise, I might as well try to hide them. Any suggestions on what to use that won't cake, crease, or look obvious? 

More info: the dark spot isn't directly under my eye; it's like a wide sliver that runs a little lower. It's purple/dark bluish. I've done some searching before and am considering using the Bobby Brown creamy concealer.. would that work? Will I need additional eye creams or something?

Thanks a lot for the help! You all are awesome.

But apparently without makeup I'm just a slob that puts no effort in?)  

Nobody seems to understand I get burns, rashes and hives.  

At one interview I got so pissed off at one woman getting so high-and-mighty about how I couldn't possibly be THAT sensitive (she would not let my lack of makeup go without a lecture) that I pulled out a physicians formula compact I had in my purse and applied powder to half of my face.  She got the pleasure of sitting there watching me break out into hives fairly quickly.  She was horrified and apologized, I just glared and walked out then straight to a fast food joint to wash my face in the bathroom.  Unprofessional, but people just don't get it.

Is there any makeup out there that is truly and purely organic?  Even the organic stuff I find has titanium dioxide in it, and it is nasty on my skin.  I'm sorry if this seems a bit scattered, but I'm really upset and at my wits end here.

It bothers me a lot, and I think I may resort to makeup to try to cover it up. I want to be able to buy whatever I need online (Amazon preferably), as I do not want to go to a store for it.

Can someone please help me figure out what I need? I don't know a THING about make-up other than where lipstick goes... so I am all ears here.

I'm only wanting to cover up my eye region, I don't want to expand much further as I want something relatively simple and quick I can every morning. I want it to look natural and hard for people to tell (I guess that's the goal for everyone, though...), I'm not worried about it running off on people or anything like that

I thought I'd let whoever claim dibs over it get it first. I did [swatch it on my arm](http://i.imgur.com/z6NJ4Ch.jpg) (will wipe with alcohol).

I have oodles of beautiful eyeshadows and other fun stuff...but I have to save those for when I go out.

I've TRIED primers - from the super cheap (e.l.f.) to not-that-expensive (Prime Time.) Prime Time helped a tiny bit, but not enough to justify the extra expense. I haven't tried the expensive ones (Too Faced, Lorac etc...) because they're pretty much out of my budget.

~ Ink For Eyes in Demolition (if you have ever had trouble with eyeliner this stuff is amazing)
~ Grind house pencil sharpener (exciting for me anyway).

So now on to what I got for free (all tester size but hey)
~Stardust eyeshadow in Retrograde
~Super curling mascara
~Eyeshadow in Oil Slick
~2 Eyeshadow primer potion (the original)
~Eyeshadow in Evidence
~Eyeshadow in Half baked
~Afterglow Glide on Cheek tint (really bright looking but amazing on)
~All nighter long lasting setting spray
~Lip Junkie lip gloss in Midnight Cowboy
plus two trial sizes of a men's fragrance and women's fragrance (it was in a department store so this is why)

Anyway all the free stuff is great, but I also learned so many tricks and tips that the money spent was so well worth it!  (Birthday present from my boyfriend) If you ever get a chance take this class as it is amazing!!!!!!

Hey reddit. I need your help. My entire life I have wondered why my eyemakeup would make me look worse rather than better. I know I am not very attractive, but something still felt wrong. 

I recently had the realization that my eyes are deep-set and slant downward at the ends (like katie holmes or Marylin Monroe), which is why none of the makeup tutorials I tried to follow in my youth worked out for me, as they were all made for people with almond shaped eyes that don't slant down.

**I desperately need makeup advice for my eyes.** How do I apply makeup for this type of eyeshape? What colors would look best on my eyes?

I included a closeup of my eyes with no makeup on the right eye, and some eyeliner on the left. I currently use just eyeliner/mascara and make it curve up near the end of my eye to counteract the down-slanting. I am scared to use eyeshadow because I don't know what to do with it and it usually makes my eyes look heavy lidded and baggy, especially when I put dark eyeshadows on my lid or in the crease. I also can't put dark colors or eyeliner under my eyes because it exaggerates the down-turned shape they have.

**Please, please help. ANY advice or tutorials are appreciated. If it helps, I have the Naked eyeshadow palette.**",,False,self,t5_2qrwc,False,,,True,t3_1hl0hm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/1hl0hm/need_help_with_makeup_for_downslanted_eye_shape/,

I live in the UK so something I can possibly try out in store before I buy it. Obviously if anyone knows of a place I could get the Benefit one for cheap(er), I would be hugely grateful.

Reason I'm not going in store and asking is because I don't want to have a representative of one company try to talk me in to buying their product and not knowing about others that could be better. 

Any suggestions? Thanks a lot!",,False,self,t5_2qrwc,False,,,True,t3_1fyz6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/1fyz6h/i_need_a_new_inexpensive_mascara_uk/,

After a hiatus of a few years, I've only started wearing makeup again over the past couple of months or so. I have quite a pale complexion and green/grey, and tend to stick to greys, blacks and natural beiges for eyeshadow (all the ones I have atm are cream shadows), sometimes black liquid eyeliner on my lids, and plain lip balm. I've got a bit of cash spare, and rather than splashing out on a couple of nice, expensive items, I want to use it to try out new types of product, new colours and so on, so I've decided to blow some money on some ELF stuff as it's pretty cheap and I can get a decent amount of stuff to experiment with. Does anyone have any suggestion as to favourite products, favourite shades etc? Happy with any suggestions from nice natural colours to very crazy and out there ones, as long as it's not similar to stuff I've said I already use.

I also have a question. I'm okay-ish at putting makeup on my lid, but whenever I try to put anything under my eyes it makes them look like they droop down very weirdly. I try to put it right along my waterline/lash line, but it always goes wrong and it wonky, patchy, too thick, and it just doesn't look right. Any tips on how to improve this? I've been using a pencil eyeliner to try to do it, so not sure if I should try something else?

My daily makeup routine is a bit of eyeliner on the bottom eyelids, and some mascara on the top. If I'm really going all out, I'll add some eye shadow and foundation.

So, what should I use my $25 dollars on?

Thanks!

I have to powder my face probably every 30 minutes ALL DAY to keep it from looking like a melty mess. I'm incredibly lucky to have virtually no acne, blackheads, etc. (thanks to Accutane several years ago).  

My routine is to use Neutrogena oil-free face wash everyday, use an astringent, cover my face in benzoyl peroxide cream, and I have been using Clinique super balanced foundation and double face powder everyday for years.

Any recommendations for how to reduce oil on my face is greatly appreciated. I'm open to suggestions on facial washes, lotions, potions, foundation, powders, etc. I also do not have sensitive skin if that helps.

Thanks!

I have been experimenting with different ways to stop my eyeliner from smudging onto the crease of my eyelid about halfway through the day.  I've tried different eyeliners and a few different eye primers.  What is frustrating is that one eye even smudges more than the other, my left eye.  I've tried a bunch of different products to help, with varying success but none that quite hit the mark. 

So far I've tried:

MAC Prep + Prime Eye - This felt so smooth and light going on, but barely helped my smudge problem at all, so I took it back and exchanged it for a Paint Pot instead.

MAC Paint Pot in Painterly - This has worked the best for me so far.  It takes the longest for any given eyeliner to smudge

Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion - This was okay but didn't work nearly as well as the MAC Paint Pot.  The same eyeliners smudged more and in a shorter amount of time

NARS  eyeliner in Black Moon - this only smudges a little bit and stays put fairly well, but it does still smudge

MAC eyeliner in Bordeauxline - This has been the best eyeliner and has smudged the least of all three that I have tried, but I still have the smudging issue

Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner in Perversion - I bought this one recently because I did a lot of research and read a ton of reviews saying this eyeliner stays put all day and never smudges.  However, it smudges the QUICKEST for me!  It has the deepest black, and I really like how the 24/7 line has so many great colors, so I was really hoping I could find a way to work this out.

My wife is of course a girly girl and loves doing makeup. Not being biased, she is extremely talented and gets a TON of compliments when we go out. We haven't always had the money to get her all the supplies and brands she dreams of, but now that is going to change. 

I came across a 193 piece Sephora makeup set on Amazon (i can provide a link if needed), which I assumed was a good deal since I think I remember her telling me Sephora was owned by OPI, one of her favorite brands... Is this a good kit? 

Also I need recommendations for a good, quality set of brushes for her. I wanted to buy her the MAC 5 piece set but it's like $70... I am your average clueless husband and I think this is honestly buying a brand... Would it be worth it to get her a MAC brush kit? What are some other options for a quality brush set?

TL;DR I want to buy my lovely wife a nice set of brushes, she has a lot of makeup but would love a full giant set like the Sephora kit. Money is not an option.

She is a truly wonderful woman and we have had a rough year full of cut backs and I want to treat her to one of her favorite things. Thank you everyone for your time!

So I'm new to this whole makeup thing and am not sure what exactly to do.  I'd like to think I got the basics, but I see what others can do and think otherwise. 


* Ok first question.  What are good, but not so expensive, brands of makeup?  My main concern is eyeshadow, linear, and mascara.  I just started a new job, it's a minimum wage job as a receptionist.  So my cash flow isn't going to be so great.


* Second.  What is office appropriate style should I wear?  Like color wise.  I've never worked in an office before.


* I also have a problem wearing foundation.  I touch my face a lot.  So I don't really wear any foundation, because I manage to wipe it off on accident.  However, I am open to advice though!


* Last problem, I have a really oily face (and hair if there's any advice on that I'll gladly take too).  How do I fix this?


As for my features/skin/hair.  I have light skin, but can get a few shades darker in the summer.  Naturally dark brown hair, I dye it to a really light brown.  Dark brown eyes that are just really small so I'm scared of using eyeliner on my upper lids because I feel they look smaller. And I sweat very easily, not beads of sweat off my forehead, but enough.

I posted here several days ago asking for help with bridesmaid makeup, as I am not a regular makeup wearer. I got some great suggestions, went out and bought a few products, and am practicing my application skills. I'm really struggling with my lips, though.

I am VERY fair, and have some pink pigmentation that extends slightly beyond the edge of my lower lip. It's not that big of a deal when I'm not wearing anything on my lips, as it's just a shade or so lighter than my lips are, so it's not terribly obvious. Putting anything colored on my lips REALLY accentuates it, though -- if I keep the product on my lips alone, it looks like I've got lipstick smears or something, and if I try to ""expand"" my lip line a bit to incorporate the pigment bleed-over, my lower lip looks freakishly large.

I've done a bit of googling about the issue, and have seen concealer and foundation both recommended to cover up any initial color before lipstick application. I haven't seen any particular product brands/names mentioned, though. I'm using BB cream on my face rather than foundation, as it was suggested as a great lightweight option. It is, but it's also too light to cover up this much pink. Any suggestions on what specific product I should snag to use as a lip base? If there are other ways of resolving ""my lips don't know where they end"", that would also be great info to have.

I really need makeup, but I don't want to spend a fortune because - *as the title explains* - I'm a beginner. Money isn't a huge concern, I'll have enough regardless. But I don't want to go kray.

**Question**: For a girl with *NO* makeup whatsoever, what do I need? And, more to point, what should I buy?!

Here's what I think I want:

* [*Maybelline Expert Eyeshadow Quad Natural Smokes*](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Maybelline-Expert-Eyeshadow-Quad-Natural-Smokes-02?skuId=693736)

* [*Liquid Eyeliner*](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Revlon-ColorStay-Liquid-Liner-All-Day-Wear-Blackest-Black-251?skuId=350354)

* [*Mascara*](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/CoverGirl-Queen-Lash-Fanatic-Mascara-Very-Black-Q100?skuId=869522)

But I also need foundation (*I have no idea what I'm looking for - other than the fact that I have regular skin tone*), primer, and something for contouring. Any eye-related purchases that I missed would also be appreciated! Oh, and what the heck is BB cream?

***

I plan on going to CVS and/or Walgreens at lunch time. **PLEASE HELP ME!** &lt;3",,False,self,t5_2qrwc,False,,,True,t3_1bky9s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/1bky9s/drug_store_makeup_help_beginner/,

After a big breakup, I want to feel like a new me, and about as vindictive as I get would be looking great in front of my ex. 

The problem is that I cannot tell if it looks good or terrible. It is probably related to Asperger's syndrome. I have trouble recognizing faces, reading expressions, noticing if someone did even something drastic to their appearance, or if I do notice, I often can't tell what's different. The same issue with my face. 

I think I have a decent facial structure, and pretty clear skin, but I can't really tell what other people would see as problems. I once went to get a haircut and had the lady go"" oh my god how have you been walking around with you hair color that uneven!!"" I couldn't tell what she was talking about, at all.

I have tried makeup in the past, but have done some apparently very wrong things. IE- Baby powder as face powder, eyeliner making my eyes look smaller, color matching to my skin very wrong or missed spots. That was in high school mostly, so maybe my adult eyes and brain will save me from some big mistakes, but **I am worried about looking like an idiot!**

Most of my friends are guys, or other non-makeup girls. My mom would make me look like... a mom. I don't know how to construct a look that is ""me"". Once I have that, I wont know how to make sure I execute it correctly.

The video gurus I could see being helpful once I knew which things I needed to do. Obviously the ""seductress eye blast"" is not the right video for me, but what is? I am ultra clueless.

Also, I have super sensitive skin and would like to know if any of the ""natural"" or ""organic"" brands are any good at all.

So to sum up, I'd like to learn how I can:

Know what I need to fix.
Find something that fits my personality.
**Know if I've done it right, or if I am scary looking!**

Help!

I'm into my alternative, indie music with a decent helping of eclectic electro and electroclash. I like to wear somewhat striking but casual clothes. I love to wear dark blacks with my bright yellow tigers or red high-tops, a metallic necklace thrown in. I guess I tend towards a darker look with a part of the outfit standing out in stark colour. I like to look good, at least what I think that means, and er, express myself as they say. I like people to be able to tell on first glance that I'm odd, that I'm on the edge of the bell curve and have something interesting to say. I tend to ride the boundary between intriguing and intimidating but too much the latter, keeping many a conversation at bay. I reckon make-up will help me better express my personality and style as well as help open myself to more people and great conversations.

I wear glasses, with an eye condition that prevents the use of contacts. I'm sure that isn't helpful when it comes to this stuff. I have longer hair, going on shoulder length right now. I like to rock some stubble or more often, a bit more growth than that. Apart from loving the look, I find it helps define my face and neck.

* discolouration around mouth
* Dark circles under my eyes
* Large pores on forehead, upper cheeks and chin
*Small scars on the jawline area

Sorry for my photo. It's the only one I have access to at the moment since I'm using my friend's laptop. (They had this saved from our Skype date a few months ago.)

I've been given a few pieces by some friends in the past few months:
Physician's Formula Blush in Blushing Natural 
Maybelline Colossal Volume Mascara
3 Covergirl individual eyeshadows in Black, Navy Blue and Purple

Help? LOL 

Well, what I really want to know is what makeup should everyone have? I'd like to start from those basics and eventually expand. I'm clueless about what to get when I step in to MAC, Sephora and the cosmetic counters at department stores. 

EDIT: Sorry about the photo! It's been raining pretty hard for the past few days and was kept busy because of it.

I am trying to refine my makeup routine and would love some advice on whether I should be using finishing powder (currently considering MUFE HD) or setting spray (considering UD De-Slick) or possibly both or neither.

My current routine for my combo skin is oil-free moisturizer, concealer then foundation (I use MUFE Mat Velvet.) I tried out several of the ""top"" primers, but never really noticed any difference when I used them it which made it difficult to justify the cost, so now I just skip it.

My persistent issue is that no matter what I do I still get a bit shiny in my t-zone towards the end of the day. I am looking for something to combat this issue, preferably without having to do touch ups. 

Does anyone have experience with one or both of these products or have suggestions for something else that might help keep me matte throughout the day?

Any recommendations on a setting powder?,magmags,4,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/17inw2/is_green_still_a_thing_in_terms_of_neutralizing/,"Hey r/Makeup! I'm a newbie to this here subreddit and I have a potentially silly question for you. Is the use of a green stick or green concealer considered the best way to camouflage red spots?

I had pretty bad acne as a teenage but thankfully the scarring wasn't too bad. The last several months, however, I've been suffering from adult acne so now I have a whole new slew of marks all over my face.

I use Vichy Dermablend liquid foundation with Setting FX loose powder, but I find I really have to pile on the Dermablend to cover my marks and even then, they're still kind of noticeable, almost purple compared to the rest of my skin. Over the course of the day, because I have pretty oily skin, the foundation starts to wear off in my most oily areas and it looks terrible.

So actually, in addition to the green question, I'd also like to know if anyone has any suggestions for a liquid foundation with the same kind of coverage as this one, as well as a setting powder? I'm pretty sure my oily skin is the main culprit and I'm upping my water intake in an effort to tone it down.

Cover FX was my best friend for many years so I tend to stick to their line, hence the Setting FX. I love the Vichy Dermablend except that it seems to wear off and looks blotchy about halfway through the day.



**tl;dr** - Is green cover-up the best way to camouflage red marks? What are some better setting powders than Setting FX?

That being said, I'm in a financial position to blow a decent amount of money on makeup and I really would like to find some stuff that is appropriate to my face. For years I've made due with little or no foundation, I'm afraid of blush, I just go with my standard day or evening look and don't do much else. 

I have oily but dry skin which has been the bane of my existance trying to find foundations. 

Typically I've bought the palest shade of Tarte powder coverup that I could from Sephora. I liked it, it is nice- if there is something better out there I'd love to know!

General complexion: http://i.imgur.com/vbXt3.jpg?1

I'm very pale, ginger, I wear blue contacts (brown eyes naturally, but since I needed a perscription I decided to play some).
I cannot stress how pale I am. I got frustrated at the MAC store in Carnaby Street because I tried every foundation they had in store and none of them were pale enough for me.

I would also love some suggestions for what to DO with my makeup. What else should I buy? What would be a good complete look?

I'm also looking for suggestions on what color/tones I should be looking for when it comes to blush and possibly eye-shadow (to be honest, eye shadow terrifies me because I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. haha).

My store didn't either have the whole collection in yet or already sold out. I hope to get the black/yellow eye palette too, if I can find it. I am pale and for reference, I wear NC15 in MAC, though could go a little paler if they had something for me. In Dior, I wear 010. 
The two Photo OP eye palettes I got were the Dutchess Lounge and the Desert Festival. I am really excited about the Desert Festival as I have red hair and hazel eyes and believe this will really look great!
The two Reflect Shimmer Palettes I got were the Rose Champagne Glow and the Rose Golden Goddess. 
I'll have a couple videos out soon on how they look and how I used them. Let me know what you think about the collection and should I buy more or not worth it.

Some ('bout half) of my eyelashes are white, and I want to conceal them so that they're all the same color. I put on mascara occasionally, but...

* I have not discovered a method for getting all the way to the roots, and consequently it looks weird.

* Furthermore, my eyelashes are REALLY long as is (my #1 source of random comments/jealousy from women), and mascara was designed to lengthen, not color.

This is something that I really want to solve, because my white eyelashes are mostly on one eye, leading to a whole not-symmetric appearance that, beyond breaking the number 1 law of facial beauty, makes me hate the way I look in pictures (since I usually see myself in a mirror, where sides are switched). I honestly avoid looking at pictures/video of myself.

Additionally, I'm a guy, and we all know that makeup is gendered. Fortunately, I'm also gay, so that's not such a bad thing.

If any of you have advice / ideas / etc.., that'd be greatly appreciated. I would post pictures for reference except that I wore mascara yesterday, and it's only partially come off, and thus would neither be representative of me with nor without it on.",,False,self,t5_2qrwc,False,,,True,t3_1cdc2y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Makeup/comments/1cdc2y/covering_white_eyelashes/,
