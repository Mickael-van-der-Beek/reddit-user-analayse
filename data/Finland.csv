In 2009 Sweden’s military started spying all internet traffic that goes through Sweden. This is even worse than U.S. spying, because they are monitoring every land line call, mobile calls, emails and IM-traffic. Most of the Nordic and partly Russian traffic goes through Sweden’s optical fibers.

Now Sweden and UK has used veto in EU-parliament to stop conversation between EU and U.S. Is anyone really surprised?

Nyt kun on puhuttu Snowdenin julkaisemasta vakoilujupakasta, niin onko maailma unohtanut, miten Ruotsi aloitti vuonna 2009 täysivaltaisen Ruotsin läpimenevän tietoliikenteen tarkkailun?  Tämä koskee pääasiallisesti Pohjoismaita ja osaa Venäjää, sillä ruotsin läpi kulkee 100-200 mm valokaapelit. Lähes kaikki Suomen ulkomaan tietoliikenteestä kulkee Ruotsin kautta. Matka- ja lankapuhelin-, sähköposti- ja muu verkkoviestintä kulkee maailmalle Itämeren pohjassa kulkevia supertehokkaita valokaapeleita pitkin.
Tässäkään ei ole kysymys mistään satunnaisesta kuuntelusta, vaan kaikkien sähköpostien, puhelinkeskustelujen ja pikaviestintäkeskustelujen seulomisesta. Miten tämä eroaa Yhdysvaltalaisten suorittamasta vakoilusta? Olemmeko unohtaneet tämän ja syytämme Yhdysvaltoja vakoilusta, vaikka pahin yksityisyyden uhka löytyykin naapurista?

http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/talous/ruotsi-aloitti-verkkoliikenteen-salakuuntelun-mita-pitaa-tehda-ja-tietaa

http://www.taloussanomat.fi/ihmiset/2009/11/14/ruotsin-vakoojille-paasy-sahkoposteihin/200923768/133

http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/ict/ruotsi+aloittaa+viestiliikenteen+vakoilun+tanaan/a353088

Ei ole myöskään mitenkään ihmeellistä, että Iso-Britannia ja Ruotsi estivät keskustelun vakoilusta EU:n ja Yhdysvaltojen välillä käyttämällä veto-oikeuttaan. Miksi tappaa lypsävää lehmää?

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/05/us-blocks-espionage-talks-europe-nsa-prism?CMP=twt_fd&amp;CMP=SOCxx2I2


Mielestäni on hyvin outoa, ettei Suomen hallinto ole ottanut mitään kantaa Ruotsin vakoiluun, vaikka Ruotsin puolustusvoimat ovat avoimesti ilmoittaneet tätä suorittavansa. Olisiko nyt aika tehdä asialle jotain? Mitä mieltä on Reddit?


TL;DR: Sweden is evenly bad, maybe even more corrupt spy than U.S.

Give your vote at: https://www.kansalaisaloite.fi/fi/aloite/74

This shit will never happen, but all publicity is good publicity. Do it for us, and maybe, just maybe before we die cannabis will be legal in Finland too. Spread the word!

Same (more or less) in finnish: Nyt kaikki allekirjottamaan ko. aloite. Perkele, ei tosta koskaan mitään lakia saada (ei ole yhdestäkään kansalaisaloitteesta vielä saatu edes asiaa eteenpäin (korjaus, menihän tuo turkistarhausaloite eduskuntaan)), mutta kun asia nostetaan nyt pöydälle, ehkä sitten joskus eläkeiässä saadaan poltella ihan laillisesti.

Kunhan saadaan guzerina-richardsonit ja päiviräsäset sun muut vanhoilliset, suomen kouluissa vuosikymmeniä tehdyn ""huumevalistuksen"" uhrit pois tuolta eduskunnasta ja uutta, itse ajattelevaa verta tilalle, niin toivo alkaa herätä.

Aika toimia on nyt, varsinkin kun netin kautta on pirun helppo äänestää. Sana leviämään hyvän asian puolesta poijjaat ja plikat!

P.S. samalla ""kirjautumisella"" on hyvä kannattaa muitakin aloitteita, esim. Järkeä tekijänoikeuslakiin kuulosti ihan asialliselta.

P.P.S Hamppuforumilla asiaa puidaan threadissa: http://www.hamppu.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=55816

I remember an image of a purple monster in a cupboard eating jam.  Can you help me find this book?",CitizenKaininen,52,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/y58md/i_am_a_halffinnish_australian_whose_earliest/,"I remember two pages from this book.

The one I described in the title was the most memorable one for me.  The purple jam-eating monster was large and hairy (or at least that's how I remember it), rather like [Sulley](http://imgur.com/VIwsY) from Monsters Inc.  It was in a kitchen cupboard with an open door, facing outward toward the reader, and eating jam with a spoon.
 
On another page (the opposite page, I think) there were two children, a boy and a girl, running.  I believe it was toward the right of the reader.

That's all I remember.  And although it was in Finnish, for all I know it may have been a translation from another language.

The aeroplane in question was the one that brought my parents and me to Australia (as I was born in Finland, too).  And my next memory was walking down the airstairs off the plane and into the powerful Australian sunlight, and realising I had left the book onboard.  I asked my parents about the book, but they said I couldn't go back to get it.  So I asked what would happen to it, and they said it would probably get thrown out.

It was a book that, I understand, my (Finnish) grandmother gave me.  I know I had grown very fond of the book, and I remember feeling a profound sense of loss from that incident.  This memory has stayed with me for the past 37 years, and I know that if I were to ever see images from that book again (or at least of the two pages I described), it would be an extraordinary feeling.

So do my descriptions seem familiar to anyone?  Or is there somewhere else that might be good to look for obscure Finnish children's books from the 70's (or possibly earlier, as I don't know the original publication date)?  Finnish language websites are certainly acceptable.

PS I would have posted this on /r/Suomi as well, but my Finnish vocabulary is a bit rusty these days.  I haven't had much chance to speak it for a long time, because unfortunately my mother died in the 90's - and I always spoke to her in Finnish.  So I have a phantom language in my brain, but it is quite atrophied.  Mind you, I can read Finnish (slowly), so as I said, I'm ok with Finnish websites.",,False,self,t5_2qztz,False,,,True,t3_y58md,http://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/y58md/i_am_a_halffinnish_australian_whose_earliest/,

Since the post on YSK earlier today about memrise, I've been learning some basic Finnish vocabulary. This also led me to doing some research about Finland. And while I do not at all understand how you can have different conjugations of the infinitive, Finland seems like a pretty amazing place. I saw that amazing photo series of old Finnish people with things on their heads; I read about Finnish visas for victims of sex trafficking; ...I may have checked out your guys on OkC. Really, apart from the cold, it seems pretty awesome all-around.

Soo, anyway. I was wondering: how do most Finnish people feel about Finland? Are there common things that everybody, or most people, really dislike about it? Is the cold hard to deal with? Does your country have secret and major flaws? Basically, I guess: do you feel like your country looks better from the outside than it feels from the inside? For example: I'm from Australia, and I hear people talk about how our industrial relations laws, for example, are good -- but really, they are not that great and are being eroded fairly quickly.

Our idea this time was drug addict, specifically opiate addiction. Most of us in the US have been effected by the drug Oxycontin, and now it seems to be heroin. We wanted to see what it was like in other countries, so we did our research, and couldn't decide on a film, until one seem to choose us.

That documentary was Reinderspotting. We were mesmerized by the fact that not only a person could use a heroin substitute drug, Subutex. Let alone decide to IV the drug. We were instantly impressed how the film showed an addict's journey without seemingly to have an agenda. 

I've personally watched the film about 4 times, and the production company I work for was extremely impressed. So I'm here to hopefully learn more!

Few Questions:

Is Subutex and Tegmesic still the most abused drug in Finland?

Have you been effected by these drugs or known someone whom has?

How easy is it to obtain Subutex and Tegmesic in Finland?

Also, I understand that the director,  Joonas Neuvonen, is in prison for trafficking Subutex to Finland. Is this true? Can foreigners contact prisoners? I believe he is imprisoned in Ouhlo(sp).

The main character of the film Jani Raappana, apparently hung himself in Cambodia, so the local newspaper said. Does anyone remember this being a story or a controversy? Did Jani Raappana's friends or family ever speak on it?

I have tons of questions, if anyone could help me out I would be much appreciative. If you can end up helping in the end, there could be some cool American shwag (stuff) headed your way!

* How safe is it to be walking around/travelling alone?

* How helpful are people when talking to someone who only speaks English? Most young people in Finland speak English, but will I have any difficultly not knowing the language? 

* Do you think I will have troubles with my school work, seeing as Finland is one of the top education countries?

* Is it really that cold??

* And just for fun: What are the Finnish men like &amp; do they like American girls? ;)

These are just off the top of my head. I will add more the list as this thread hopefully progresses. Thank you so much!

The article brings up that some Finns has threatened the broadcaster and called her ""traitor"" and ""swedish whore"". It also tells us that  there are strong public opinions in favor of regarding Sweden as a former occupying power.

Another example in the article is that if Sweden loses early in the Hockey World Cup, we will nearly all cheer for Finland, which vice versa would never happen that Finland would cheer for Sweden

This came as quite a shock for me since most people in Sweden consider Finland as the ""brother in the east"" since we share so much history. Another example is our minister of defence that has said that sweden will instantly help finland if you are attacked, but with this im pretty sure that Finalnd will help Sweden as well.

So my question is if this article fits in to the real situation in Finland, or if its exagurated. If it is true, how large portion of the population thinks like this? What is your opinion?

How much control do teachers have over their curriculum/pacing?
What's your teacher/student ratio?
What do you ascribe the success of the Finnish system over the past twenty year to?
For teachers, what was your training like? Did you feel prepared to teach when you started?

And the big one: I've heard, repeatedly, that the Finns emphasize EQUITY over anything else. How does that play out for your schooling system? 

EDIT: We often say in America that our schools are ""failing our students."" Is that an idea that seems strange to Finland?

**EDIT EDIT: I've seen a lot of replies that mention the equitable nature of Finish society.

I am a 22 year old female who moved to the U.S. when I was three years old. All my relatives, besides my parents, live in Finland and many would come and visit throughout the year. I spoke English in school and with my friends but my parents only speak to me in Finnish. My Finnish is obviously not perfect since I only ever spoke it with my parents and relatives and never went to school in Finland.

I went to Finland last summer for two weeks, for the first time in 13 years. I felt as if I was complete. The way I imagine a Jew feels when they travel to Israel, minus all the religious aspects (I guess that agnostic Finnish trait is genetic and not environmental heh). My whole family is Finnish, I have a very Finnish name, I've grown up only speaking Finnish to my parents, I've slept with Muumi-pussilakanat, learned all about my mom's Iittala dishes, and melted tin on New Year's Eve.

I decided last summer I wanted to someday live there again. I applied to a master's program (taught in English) at the University of Helsinki and I was accepted. I'm moving there this August. I am so excited but have no idea what to expect. I look Finnish and have a Finnish name so I can imagine most strangers will automatically speak to me in Finnish. I speak with an ""American accent"" and I'm not always grammatically correct. Will Finns think I'm retarded? Should I explain I just moved back from the U.S. or not bother? Will native Finns accept me or think less of me since I've lived in the U.S.? Also, I have Finnish as well as American citizenship. Any other advice would be wonderful, kiitos!




**TL;DR - I'm 22 and I've lived in the U.S. for most of my life, but learned the Finnish language and customs at home from my parents and visiting relatives. I am starting a master's program this August at the University of Helsinki and do not know what to expect. I also still have my Finnish citizenship. Any advice would be wonderful!**

I am a high school English (Language Arts ) teacher in Canada and am interested in some of the particulars in Language Arts (äidinkieli) classes in upper secondary school (or ""lukio""). Please feel free to answer any of the below questions with as much or little detail as you'd like.

1. What are final exams like in these classes? Where I teach, usually a final examination would be worth about 30% of the term's final mark, and would consist mostly of multiple choice questions on reading comprehension and a writing section. What is it like in Finland?

2. How do teachers deal with deadlines for assignments? Is it a more permissive system, or are deadlines for assignments fixed and strict?

3. Are classes more lecture based (like university), group work-based, student-driven, or a variety?

4. Are students required to take Language Arts classes at vocational school? How are they different from at upper secondary school?

Thanks so much :)

I'll get right down to it - I'd love to move to Finland, but I need some help and clarifaction. (and I'd greatly appreciate any advice you share)
I'll be starting my final year of high school in the US this coming August, and once I've completed that, my hope is to leave for Finland. The good news - I'm already a Finnish citizen! The bad news - I don't speak a word of Finnish! 
So here are my ideas. (please let me know if I'm wrong about anything or if I don't know what I'm talking about at all):

&gt;Contact the Finnish embassy here in the US and say I want to do my service in the FDF. My understanding is that it's possible to serve despite not speaking Finnish, and I would just most likely be stationed somewhere for non-Finnish speakers. I've talked to some other Finns and I believe they mentioned Santahamina. Would there be options to help learn Finnish while serving?

&gt;Apply to a university in Finland. Since I'm already a Finnish citizen, I imagine it would be easier than if I were not? I've looked online and while it seems that some universities have courses in English, I'd prefer to learn Finnish and take the classes in Finnish. Is this a bad idea? Should I take courses in English than transfer once I become more proficient in Finnish? When do Finnish students typically apply to universities? Before they leave for the FDF? After they return?

&gt;I'm trying to learn Finnish here in the US, but it's quite difficult due to the lack of resources compared to a language like Spanish. (I'm still trying though!) Do you happen to know of any resources for practicing Finnish? I've downloaded some old Finnish textbooks and other materials, but I'm always open to other suggestions!



I'll ask you r/Finland, is this feasible? Could I actually move to Finland to study and live there? Please let me know your thoughts. Any comments are _extremely_ appreciated!

Need some advice on how to proceed to get some basic rights",Sulucniv,31,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/16qz5k/moved_here_from_norway_now_im_stranded_in_the/,"Not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this, but on the off chance that anyone here has any relevant experience, I guess it can't hurt. Onto the issue at hand. Sorry for the wall of text!

I moved to Vaasa in August last year on the account of love, and to get a new job after being sick and tired of working in an office back in Norway. All the colourful and nice *Welcome to Finland* brochures tell you how there's ""free traffic"" of living and working between the Nordic countries, so I was hoping it would go relatively smooth. Nope.


One of the first things I applied for was the FPA card, in order to be included in the social security programme of Finland. The law states that an inhabitant of a Nordic country is to be insured by the state which he or she permanently resides, and I'm registered as a permanent inhabitant of Finland according to the Maistraatit, at the same address as my girlfriend. I've also been registered as unemployed at MOL since the day that I got here, and the EURES person at their office assured me I had everything in order to apply for unemployment and/or labour market subsidy if I started interning somewhere. I then promptly started working at a children's daycare centre as an intern. From what I've gathered, Kela is supposed to pay me labour market subsidy for this. After all, I work full days five days a week and there's a 40 kilometer drive each way to get to my workplace.


I received a rejection letter from Kela/FPA about 3 months after I applied, saying that I do not fulfill the criteria for social security in Finland because I do not have a job or ""any other ties to Finland"". I wrote a complaint and sent it to Kela along with all documentation of my status in the country and rights that should be transferred from the Norwegian social security instance. They got in touch a couple of times and asked for more documentation and information, which I supplied.


Last week I got yet another rejection letter, stating that my case will be sent to the highest instance that handles complaints. Apparently the waiting time there is anywhere between 3 months and 1 year, and I literally cannot afford to wait this long for my case to probably be rejected once more just because Kela seems to have decided for themselves that I'm not welcome here despite having laws and documentation on my side.


I have no idea where to go from here. I'm living off the last money I got when I sold my car before moving here, and I'm actually paying a lot of money in gas to go to work - without getting anything back. This all seems so very wrong, and the last time I talked to my contact at MOL, she just shook her head in disbelief and tried getting in touch with Kela on my behalf to discuss my case, but it didn't lead to anything. I'm constantly applying for jobs and going on interviews, but it's *really fucking hard* to get an entry-level job when you don't speak the language the majority of the country speaks. I do great in Swedish, but there aren't really that many Swedish-Finnish employers hiring. Does anyone know any magic tricks to be welcomed into this country? I'm running out of options, and fast.


**TL;DR:** Kela/FPA won't grant me basic social security rights, despite having all my documentation in order. How do I sweet-talk them into understanding I'm here to stay and not just leech on their welfare system? I must convey to them somehow that I just need some help getting on my feet.",,False,self,t5_2qztz,1358430441.0,,,True,t3_16qz5k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/16qz5k/moved_here_from_norway_now_im_stranded_in_the/,

Also the probability of experiencing it is more in less cosmopolitan areas. But I think all that holds good for most countries today.

Also, I understand Finland, being such a homogenous society, is bound to be at least slightly wary of people who look different.

    Recently a collegue of her, spanish too, have lost his father.
    They are very upset because none of their finnish colleagues went to him to give him their condolences. In Spain this is the usual way to proceed.
    I told her that probably in Finland the silence about this kind of situations is a sign of respect. From my point of view they are preserving his privacy and his decision of talking or not about his father's death. This is my point but I have not had the oportunity to ask any finnish  about this topic.

My sister is going to move to Finland to study for her Nursing degree. She got admitted to the program at Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences. This is the first time she will be living oversea so she is half anxious and half excited about it. Therefore, I try to reach out and hopefully you guys can provide us some insight into culture and living:

- The most important thing we are concerned about is what she should bring with her to Finland, especially to prepare her for the weather in your country. I live in a desert (Arizona, USA) so I'm very clueless about cold weather. Should she bring lots of jacket, scarf, glove and sock?

- Any tip for housing? She is going to live at a place arranged by her university. But I'm sure there is cheaper options out there. 

- Finance issues: Should my sister bring cash? We are from Southeast Asia. From my experience living in the US, we just transfer money from my country to a local bank in the US. Is it as much as convenient like here in Finland? She is going to open an account with a Finland bank too, what's her best option?

- Is there any exchange site for her to purchase second hand stuff like household appliance, electronic, etc. like craiglist in the US?

- Cell phone plan: Is there any carrier that offers prepaid plan? What's some reasonably priced option? 

That's some of our many concerns right now. Please feel free to add some unrelated tips if you think it's important for us. Thank you very much for your time and I hope you all have a nice day! :)

**UPDATE: Thank you so much. My sister went through every single comment and we are thrilled by your hospitality. You guys pretty much cleared up most of our big concerns.** 
One more thing though, my sister also would like to find a part time job. Is there any jobs available that requires little to no Finnish? Her English is decent to keep up with the academic program but she still struggles to learn your language. She is told that for a certain occupation it would requires hygiene passport/license. Is that true? My sister just wants to find a job so she can ease off the financial burden from our family and have a better opportunity of assimilating your culture.

Related to this are the more serious forms of organized crime.

What the heck should Finland do about this thing? Of course people in need of help should be helped, no matter their nationality or ethnicity, but is this the way it should be done (help them in Finland, rather than in Romania etc)? What do you think, should we deal with this thing primarily with the police or with social workers (providing health care, food, housing, money)?

If there are any Romanians or such reading this, what are your thoughts about this subject? Personally I have been surprised that non-Romani Romanians haven't come forth in the media to speak about this subject in any way.

EDIT: Please do realized that **Romani is a politically corrent version of ""gypsy""**. **90% of Romanians are not gypsies (Romani)**.

Maybe it was the recent [Newsweek](http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/08/newsweek_finland_worlds_best_country_1907500.html) article that ranked you as the top country to live in, but I just wanted to drop quick a note to tell you a few things.

* It's funny, but I can't believe how much I miss [Vaasan ruisleipä](http://www.vaasan.com/public/fi/06_uutiset/01_arkisto/20100108_herkullisia_tuotteita.jsp).  God, I've even called the factory and they won't ship it to me.  I'm stuck eating this American shit and even when my wife finds rye bread, it still sucks.

* One time a Finnish friend of mine took me to a Finnish cemetery at midnight around Christmas.  She told me it would be [special](http://www.flickr.com/photos/78142996@N00/333220618/), but I had no idea what was going on.  The whole place was covered in snow and people were paying their respects by [putting candles on the graves](http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/gallery/091224/GAL-09Dec24-3423/media/PHO-09Dec24-195307.jpg).  It was so quiet, surreal, peaceful and beautiful.  I'd never felt reverence like that before. I haven't felt it since.

* I miss [Helsinki](http://www.primetravels.com/PackageImages/697/Helsinki.gif) and [Tampere](http://www.europeancitiesmarketing.com/userfiles/image/Tampere2a.jpg).  My time in those cities was incredible.  However, I still have mixed feelings about [Varkaus](http://lasseh.avaruus.net/rata/heina2005/varkaus2.jpg).  I'm still kind of pissed about that asshole drunk who tried to steal my bike in that town and really, the whole place stinks of the [local paper factory](http://www.storaenso.com/about-us/mills/finland/varkaus-mill/PublishingImages/varkaus-mill.jpg).

* I miss the Finnish [summers](http://www.ifpraeuropemikkeli.com/fi/sisalto/004_post_tour/fi_image2).  The sun would be up all the time, we'd go to the cabin by the lake, do the [sauna](http://www.buzzle.com/showImage.asp?image=13225) thing and then [swim in the lake](http://www.allcountries.org/photos/finland/summer_by_the_lake_saimaa_pihlajavesi_finland_photo_finland_tourist_board.jpg).  That one time we even found a [blueberry patch](http://www.ehau.ru/img/2009/karel-peresheek/chernika-karelia.jpg) near the cabin and I made blueberry pancakes in the morning.  (I don't miss the winter though, that shit was cold.)

* I miss the Finnish women.  They were so curious about the U.S. and forgiving of my bad Finnish.  [Headstrong](http://images.usatoday.com/news/_photos/2006/01/14/finnish.jpg), but [fun to be around](http://img244.imageshack.us/i/korkkariamlhipr3.jpg/). And they're [beautiful](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jommanilat/1331002604/).  I would have married one of you if I hadn't run into that smoking hot Danish girl that I eventually married.

* I miss these [two guys at the train station](http://www.travel-images.com/pht/fin183.jpg).  I'd always imagine that they were waiting for the right moment to drop that ball on someone's head.

* I miss Finnish Hockey.  I'll be honest, I don't even know what's going on most of the time. I just loved that [you loved it so much](http://0.tqn.com/d/proicehockey/1/0/e/B/96702624.jpg).

* When I hear [Maamme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maamme), I still think of what you told me about the [Winter War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War) and my eyes water.

We spent two years together - two *really* good years - and I still have these really strong feelings for you. I wish I could come back, but the type of business I'm in doesn't really transport to other countries that well.  I guess I just wanted to say that I still love you and I wish we could be together.  Please take good care of yourself.

I'm trying to surprise my girlfriend for her birthday. All it takes for you to help is a quick visit to a Vero Moda store and a photograph.

Backstory: last winter she traveled to Europe from the US and brought home a beautiful lace dress from ""Only"" that she purchased at a Vero Moda store. A few weeks later, before she even had a chance to wear it, some jackass (me) managed to burn a hole clean through it with some fireworks. [Pics of the carnage.](http://imgur.com/a/kPeGJ)

Fast forward a few months; her birthday is coming up, and I've been trying to find a replacement for the dress with no luck. Seems it's out of season and out of production.

So I have this humble request of anyone who can: **IF** you happen to be going somewhere where there is a Vero Moda store, and **IF** you want to take a minute to help out a stranger,

a) Swing in and ask them if they happen to have a ""Nadin 3/4 EX Lace Dress"""" in white, size M or L (see imgur album for the actual tag).

When they say ""no,""

b) take a picture of yourself in front of the store, holding a sign that says ""Sorry, Heather!"" and indicates your location. I figure if nothing else, I can show her these to show I tried...

Here's a link to the [store locator utility](http://www.veromoda.com/store-locator) on Vero Moda's website.

I've been in Finland maybe 9 months now and have many friends here and don't consider myself in an anti-social situation, but I can fully understand how easy it could be to live on your own and never have any human interaction if you really wanted, or if there was something strange about you. Neighborhoods in Finland are very anonymous, there is no sense of real connection or community in my opinion. Nobody knows who their neighbors are, nor do they care until they do something bad.

Even walking through shopping centers or down a road you can see the tension in people's reactions. Most Finns (especially mid-aged) get really tense if you are near them or approaching them. I remember being in a kirpputori and causally browsing the isles and not walking fast or anything. There was a guy up ahead looking at some things and as soon as I got close enough he dropped what he was looking at and walked away, even though there's plenty of room for the both of us......resulted in a ridiculous situation that every time I moved he would move. Was he even interested in what he was looking at? Just weird behavior, and quite common so I've seen..

I will accept that this could be because I am a weird looking dude! :p

I've been told Finland used to be worse in this regards. Can anyone shed some light on this? Maybe some tips for foreigners who perceive this as rudeness and end up having negative impressions of Finns?

If you have some time to spare, tks for sharing your knowledge and answer some of my questions.**


Hei fellow Redditors of Finland! I will be spending 4 weeks (July) in Pohjois-Pohjanmaa/Northern Ostrobothnia, slightly north east of Oulu, somewhere in between Pudasjärvi and Taivalkoski, near to Lake Koivujärvi together with some friends in a nice little cottage with lake access (+ boat and kanootti) and separate sauna house, no TV, no flowing water, electricity from solar collector. We will fly into Helsinki, from there we take an inland flight to Oulu, and then drive for about 170km with a rented car to ‘our’ place. 


Our days will be mainly spent with fishing, hiking, make use of our Sauna + lake and playing Magic the Gathering as a filler    … just relaxing in general and leave all our cares behind 


I have a few specific as well as general questions which I would like to address to you guys, and appreciate if you might know the answers to some of them. 


1\. **Can I bring my Compound Bow to Finland without any troubles at the customs?** After all it’s a piece of sports equipment. I am no hunter but rather a marksman which enjoys precision and I find it to be a great idea to practise in the wild since I have more than enough time in these 4 weeks. Are my reason believable or will I get into trouble. 


2\. **Are bears, wolves, lynxes a problem in the region we are staying?** I’ve read various things. But I assume this would be more of an issue in Lappi rather than in Middlefinland, or am I mistaken?


3\. **Are the solar collectors any good at this kind of cottages?** Just in general, do they produce enough electricity to recharge electronic devices such as speakers/iPods/Laptops. I know this depends on the equipment installed but in this very moment I do not have enough specific information about the solar collector, therefore this rather general question (fyi: stove/oven/fridge all run with gas)


4\. **Is alcohol sold in specific shops or in super markets?** Also, could you clarify: Is alcohol expensive in Finland because of the shortage or because of the prevention? Any place in my region where we get discount on massive purchases – Or is there no difference in regards to where we buy it?


5\. **For which town should we head if we have the urge to leave our cottage for 2 – 3 days to get among people and have a/few boozy night-out(s)?** Back to Oulu? 


6\. **Unsure if we should import our own Cannabis or rely on local sources.** We are in our late 20’s, straight forward easy going and discreet – just looking for our share of the cheeba cheeba now and then. PM me if you can help us out or be of any assistance. Maybe someone from Oulu/Rovaniemi? Or is this a no-go and my best changes are in Helsinki before the inland flight?


7\. **Anything you might want to tell me in addition?** A good place to eat / a must thing to do or to visit? We are here for 4 weeks, we can make some day trips to various places, so the distance is not an issue. Let me know!


That’s it for now. Reading through all the above I must say I find question no. 6 somehow the most important one, haha!
Kiitos paljon for your time guys! … and dammit, I can’t wait to eat Kalakukko and Lihapiirakka


Cheers,
faiaclaah

My wife saw [this video](http://www.wimp.com/finnishlapland/) and instantly said ""We need to go there""

So, I come to you asking, how in the heck do I get there? We have our passports, and it looks like we won't need a visa to visit for a week, I just have no idea how to get where we need to to see that. It looks like we need to get to the north. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to fly over there? San Diego, CA means I probably fly to New York first, and then to Helsinki, but from there I have no idea. We've only gone across the pacific and also to the bahamas, this would be our first time crossing the Atlantic.


Also, does anyone have suggestions on where to stay? We'd like to go either January, February, or November. We don't do the whole bars and nightclubs thing, we just really want to see the natural beauty of the arctic circle. Snow (Never seen it) and the night sky. Can you see stars out there? That would be lovely.

So, I know this is all over the place, but any tips? Places to look into?

The original lyrics, which were originally written as a poem, were written by the Fennoswede Johan Ludvig Runeberg in 1846 as the first poem in his poem collection book 'Fänrik Ståls sägner'. It was composed into the national anthem in 1848 by Fredrik Pacius. The translation into Finnish happened in 1889 by Paavo Cajander, but was largely based on the previous translation made in 1867.

The Estonian national anthem 'Mu isamaa, Mu õnn Ja rõõm' uses the same melody as the Finnish national anthem except without the repeating of the four last stanza, but the lyrics are completely different.

I am an American 19 year old who has dreamed of going to Finland for what seems like my entire life. I will try and remain brief (the story I tell people when they ask ""Why Finland?"") 
&gt;At a young age of around 11-12 through a lesson and project assigned in a class I became very interested in Finland. I read many books about Finland, I scavenged the internet for facts, became a regular on Finlandforum.org, read The Kalevala, listened to Finnish music (popular, folk, metal, and rap), and eventually met local Finns. I coincidentally dated a Finnish girl for about a year, had a foreign exchange student from Finland go to my high school for a year, and made a lot of musical acquaintances from an old Facebook group with around 2,000 Finnish musicians. Basically, for the past 8 years of my life I've been known by friends this way and whenever I'm introduced to people its usually (regrettably) the only thing they mention about me! Without ever travelling to Finland, I have a very strange obsession. 

Fast-forward to now and I will be (within the next week) travelling to Finland from the USA to stay in Heinola with my foreign-exchange student friend and his family about a month. I'm pretty damn excited and also trying to not remember everything I've read about Finland because simply put, I don't think everything I read is still relevant and I don't want to try and pretend like I know what my experience will be like!

I have some questions that are not the typical ""What is Finland and what do I bring?"" sort. Kind of just specific things I am packing, things to do if my friend has nothing planned, and just asking for general advice.

Thanks in advance for any replies, and please ask any questions about what I may or may not know, what its been like being obsessed with Finland in the Southern US, etc! :D

**Questions:**

* I own an iPhone 4. Will this automatically work in Finland or will I need to purchase a specific temporary SIM card? Is it even necessary to have my own working phone since I will basically be with my friend who has phone access? I will be contacting my ex-girlfriend and her family at some points during my stay and visiting them...which may be a reason for needing my own Finnish-number. *The phone should still work with Wifi and taking pictures, which is the main reason for bringing it*

* My friend and his family own a few Apple products including laptops, iPads, and (possibly) iPhones. That being said, I don't expect to have problems finding a charger for my phone but just in case, what sort of outlets are used in Finland? I suspect my charger may not be something that will work.

* I will be going to my bank here in America before I leave and let them know I will be travelling internationally so my card does not get frozen. I use a Visa debit card. Would it be easier to use cash to pay for things? I am unsure if American cards have issues swiping in Finland, or even in specific places (i.e. where I am staying, Heinola, etc).

* How much does a round-trip ferry ticket to Estonia cost?

* What is the most efficient way to visit Stockholm or Oslo? Cruise?

* What is the most efficient way to visit St. Petersburg?

* I do not expect to be driving at all, but just in case, is my american driver's license valid in Finland? Are there insurance issues involved in driving someone else's car?

* What type of ID is required for bars, clubs, etc, for tourists?

* My friend says he already has all sorts of plans for us (Lapland trip, obvious lake time, Helsinki, etc), anything you definitely recommend? I will be seeing all the obvious tourist attractions that are mentioned in every book I read, but anything so different and strange that many tourists may not ever see or steer clear of?

* I'm basically packing for 15-30 degree weather. I know its slightly chillier there recently, I shouldn't much to cover up, correct? Where I live its been record temperatures of about 42 degrees so I'm excited for some more tolerable weather.

*  Anything I should bring as a nice gift from America for my friend and his family? I know my friend loves Vanilla Coke so I might ship that out to him before I leave, but anything that is super expensive right now that would be great to receive?

* I might be trying to meet up with a few of the musicians that I have become acquainted with over the internet for so many years in Helsinki. Any nice pubs, coffee shops, etc, that are great for such meetings? 

I honestly can't think of any other questions right now because I am super tired, but I know I have them. Please include any advice or ask anything!

The fun part is, she's still wondering HOW I managed to find it. I've promised not to reveal my secret method until this weekend, when I'll present her with some kind of collage of the Vero Moda images and the reddit posts that made it happen. So if anyone is still interested in making her birthday special, making reddit look amazing, and making me look like an awesome guy, I'll still gladly accept them! I've gotten a few so far and they're all great, I appreciate it tremendously!

**TL;DR: Found the dress (thanks reddit!), she's going crazy wondering how, I'm going to reveal to her this weekend with a photo collage so I'll still take pics if you feel like sending them!**

Thanks again for being awesome, reddit!

UPDATE: One of the first things I did was email Vero Moda customer service, which redirected to Bestseller.com. They asked a few questions, and then apparently forwarded my message to a bunch of store/branch managers with the text *""A poor American guy has ruined his girlfriend’s beloved ONLY dress which she had just bought in Sweden; now he wants to replace it. Does anyone know where and if he can still get this dress?""* Today, out of the blue, I got a reply from one of them saying they had just got exactly what I wanted on a return and could sell it to me!

It seems as if US visitors frequently ask, ""what should we do/see?"" in Helsinki. **FYI for my fellow travelers, here are things I am doing** on the advice of a local friend/colleague:

Just walking around today, we went into [Temppeliaukio Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temppeliaukio_Church) and walked through the train station and many classic squares and along the harbor. As a Portland OR resident (new there but getting into it) I took many pictures of the bike paths and special bike lanes to show my friends back home.

For the bicentennial, Sederholm House (Aleksanterinkatu 18) is having ""Cafe Empire, coffee cakes of old times"" from June 9-17: you can taste food that was popular in previous eras of history. (There is also music and a good exhibit of stories from residents of Pihlajamäki, an early suburban development that is now a protected landmark.) 4 euro for a delicious ""historical"" almond pie; there were also meat pies and sour cabbage kulebyaka and beautiful ladies in historical costumes and a choice of coffee or tea.

Down near the water we ate a tumbled pile of [small grilled fish from Lapland](http://imgur.com/a/mzdhW#6) (served with or without sauce and vegetables, 7-10 euro).

It's Helsinki's turn to be [World Design Capital](http://wdchelsinki2012.fi/) so I am seeing some of those exhibitions. Also there's an amazing [retrospective of the painting of Helene Schjerfbeck](http://www.ateneum.fi/default.asp?docId=12540&amp;showInfo=14385) (I am already fascinated with women artists who address issues of aging and death, plus she's just a priori a great painter) and also a major [Georgia O'Keefe](http://www.okeeffemuseum.org/traveling-exhibitions.html) show.

To complement today's fish from the market stall, eaten standing up and looking out at the harbor, tomorrow we are dining at [The Glass Palace](http://ravintola.lasipalatsi.fi/en/index.php) where he wants me to have a super-ornate fish dish from the Tsar's own recipe. (One of the Tsars anyway...)

Next week in between doing ""work"" we are going to Tallinn to eat at [this restaurant](http://www.oldehansa.ee/) and see a city that is MUCH older than Helsinki...and on Thursday if it's not raining we are going to [Hvitträsk](http://www.nba.fi/en/museums/hvittrask). **Edited to add:** on my own I will be walking / tram-ing through the Art Deco part of town and also visiting the Arabia district. I will probably stay in the city for Juhannus itself and of course in 2 days I am going to a local [reddit meetup](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/reddit-couchsurfing-pree-juhannus/)!

This is my first visit to Finland for more than a day (came on a Baltic cruise ship in the 80s) and probably the last I can afford (in time/money) for years to come, but it is my goal both to enjoy these two weeks throughly and to bring some grandchildren here eventually. I am extremely grateful for the warm welcome and the many kinds of beauty and deliciousness here.

In addition to my host's recommendations (he is not to blame for the following) I already know I want to see some Finnish tango (sadly just missed [a good performance](www.kompitus.com)), and as a lesbian I will be catching a few days of [Helsinki Pride](http://helsinkipride.fi/index.php?id=29) (oh God, why the sausages?!); am sad to miss [Finlandization 26](http://www.mscfin.fi/), a leather festival that looks as if it's for men primarily, but I did bring one pair of my best leather boots just in case. (I enjoy dress up of all kinds and so now you know why I particularly appreciated the ladies in historical costumes, but I tried to act properly and with respect while I was in there.)

**tl;dr:** I worried that we visitors were asking local redditors to do all the work of telling us what to see, so just sharing the advice I have been given. (Once I arrived also the printed materials in multi languages were particularly helpful; the airport visitor center has plenty of them. I'm thinking to myself, *who paid for all this four color printing*...!)

OK, so I have a wonderful Finnish wife who lives with me in the UK.

My wife tells me that there are good internship schemes in Finland, so I'll be looking into that too, though I have my reservations as to whether I'd be able to get an internship because of the language.

-Why was this? Did it have something to do with the relationship with russia? what where the reasons for finland acting the way it has (pro or agains) considering the eu?

I know these are pretty hard question, but its been really hard finding 
information about it, its more factual and less about the reasons why...

I looked at multiple places, basically the only one that stood out to me was Finland (and Scotland), about 70% of your country is covered in forest as far as I know, and I do a lot of bushcraft here. (Also part of Search and rescue, native bush medicine and what not)

Also your food sounds so god-damn-FU**ing amazing (Mammi in particular sounds totally awesome)

So I hope you don't mind if I ask some questions! If some of these come off as rude or A little to personal, please tell me.

* What Is the culture like? More in regard to family culture, is it a very family orientated culture?

* Is it paralytically difficult to make friends in Finland? Are the Finnish A social, friendly bunch of people? And where would you meet them?

* What is the working culture like? Are you guys “hard men” that work 20 hours A day and rest for 4?

* What are the hunting laws like? And is hunting A large part of your culture? (It's massive over here)

* Can you get around without speaking fluent Finnish?

* Are there A large amount of outdoor clubs? Eg: Tramping, Bushcraft.

* What is the weather like in summer? (Winter is pretty self explanatory)

* Do the Finns have A problem with eccentric/energetic/outgoing people?

The next question might be come off as A little strange/personal. Please just tell me! And don't think I am some dirty bastard just going overseas for A shag!

* Are the women in Finland friendly? 
(I know I asked this in the early table, but I am asking in direct regard to the women, as I am single here and potentially living in another country would be A big part of it, hence the family culture question)

Facts:
Finnish couple, most likely on honeymoon, her name might be Sari, arrived 07. or 08. March 2013 with Finnair. Island was Ellaidhoo, room number probably 107 or 108. The German guy found their Olympus camera under water.

Original text of the guy that found the cam:
Hallo Leute,
brauche eure Hilfe.
In meinen letzten Urlaub, war ich auf den Malediven (Ari-Atoll, Insel Ellaidhoo).
Dort fand ich beim Schnorcheln (Tauchen) eine Unterwasserkamera (Olympus).
Auf der SD-Karte waren ca. 500 Bilder eines Pärchens aus Finnland die sich wohl auf Hochtzeitsreise befanden. Die Anreise war wohl am 07. oder 08.03.2013 mit Finnair.
Die Zimmernummer auf der Insel muss wohl die 107 oder 108 gewesen sein.
Der Vorname der Frau muss wohl Sari sein. 
Bitte liked und teilt diesen Aufruf, sodass er vielleicht bis nach Finnland gelangt, 
und ich dem Pärchen (die sich bestimmt freuen würden) die Kamera eventuell mit viel Glück zukommen lassen kann.
Danke an alle Hilfsbereiten.

Theory:
Finns respect Lenin as he recognised Finland's independence 3 weeks after the declaration (in stark contrast to what happened to the other nations who declared their independence from Russia at this time) as he himself respected the Finns for when he was in hiding there. And although the Soviets supported the Reds in the Civil war the view is that without Lenin as leader of the Russian SFSR the first few tentative years of Finnish independence would have been harder like other nations who had recently declared independence; for example look at Estonia.

Also a couple of years back I visited Helsinki and went to an art museum which had an exhibition on Communist art, in the museum shop they were selling t-shirts with Lenin printed on them - only Lenin - this must have cemented this theory in my mind.

Is this true? How do you feel about Lenin and how is this period taught in schools?

A friend of mine and I are visiting Helsinki October 6-8 and we are incredibly excited, especially since it is our first time in Europe! Of course we have a few questions that we were looking to get some opinions on.

We will be flying in from the airport so transportation with be needed to get to the hostel as well as potentially getting around. It looks like there is a decent tram system in the city, will a transportation pass be necessary beyond the trip from the airport? From what I can see the city is a very walker and biker friendly place, plus you get to take in the city some. Along the same lines, would it be worth it to get one of these http://www.helsinkiexpert.com/helsinki_card ?

We are probably going to stay in a hostel because we are fresh out of college and have no problem slumming it a little bit. We have narrowed it down to three hostels that seem to be in different parts of the city; CheapSleep Helsinki, Stadion Hostel, and Eurohostel. Are there any opinions about the areas and and preferences out there?

As tourists we plan on seeing a lot of sights. Helsinki has what seems to be a ton of cultural sights and museums and we hope to catch some of them. It also looks like the various boat tours and ferries could be fun weather permitting. I was just wondering if there is anything you guys could offer that we may not catch in a tourist book or website.

We have heard amazing things about Helsinki and Finland in general and we look forward to experiencing the country and what it has to offer. If any of you have any tips that may help us out it would be MUCH APPRECIATED :D

Now I am from Pakistan, currently pursuing a Masters degree in International Relations from NDU Islamabad but a close friend of mine, himself a Pakistani-Finnish, has been egging me to drop whatever I am doing and accept the offer in Finland ASAP. I am actually a Textile Engineer that unfortunately couldn't put his BSc degree (from Manchester UK no less!) to proper use because of the crisis at home, but my interests in current affairs etc has allowed me to switch fields - again unsure if it will be worthwhile or not.

Now I have gained enough knowledge to understand that Finland has one of the best education systems around the world, and its universities have been making a mark in various fields. 

I want Vasa redditors to tell me everything I need to know about the university and the city and its people. I want to know if joining ÅA Vasa would be the best decision I have ever made. Now I know that Finland's job market has not been rosy because of the global crisis, but my friend who lives in Turku said that me getting a Masters in Pakistan wont be a job guarantee either.

I have had this offer since early May 2012, but I have been putting it off and seeing how my 1st semester in NDU goes - which has gone smoothly and ended on Friday - so I haven't yet said no or yes to it.

But would it be worthwhile if you can help me choose.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Question 15 had 2 correct answers and had the option to select both.  The percentages here are of how many picked which one, but don't exactly accurately represent a strict ""Who picked the right answer"" because the wrong answer is to also just select one of them.  Anyways, yeah. 

I know that you guys are probably gonna want to debate the answers.  I will try to respond as much as I can, but until this week is over I'm still swamped with a project.  Keep this in mind, though: If I asked a question wrong or whatever then this is for a grade and I'll get docked on it.  The only one that I'm really skeptical about is Question 18 because after second guessing myself about 100 times I'm not entirely sure the answer that I was looking for isn't a phrasal verb too, so.  Just to keep you guys from debating on that one, anyway.

Otherwise, here are the results.

I'm a Canadian student that has been living abroad for almost a year in France. I have 2 months off before I have to restart University back in Canada and was intending on spending 2 weeks in Finland from the 4th of July until the 17th.

I will be coming from Krakow (Poland) by plane to Helsinki and will leave from Helsinki by plane as well.

I am going to be with a good friend of mine and the two of us really enjoy hiking. I realize the  Archipelago National Park seems really beautiful but is it really a good idea to visit by foot? (It seems you need a boat to really visit it well + we want to find a 6 or 7 day trail so we can do some camping and fishing). I read a little about the Lakeland which seems really nice and more fitting to travel by foot and also it seems to have longer trails (up to 150 km) but getting there seems to be the problem.

Like I said we intend of spending at least 6-8 days hiking and we're gonna keep a 3 or 4 day hole in our schedule to visit Helsinki and the surrounding area. Which brings me to my next point: The festivals. 

To get a good feeling of the Finnish culture we would like to find out if there are any festivals going on during the time period which we will be staying in. (4th until the 17th).

Really any tips would be helpful; either it be traditional food, activities, museums, historical monument, national parks, bar (Especially cool Helsinki bars) or anything really!

Cheers and thank you in advance! 

EDIT1: Wow ! Just got back home from work and thanks a lot for all the info! I have a much better idea of what my options are here.

I am an American student who is assigned a project on the political, social, and economic changes of Finland during World War II. I've already completed the assignment (I focused on the Winter War, the War of Continuation, Mannerheim and Simo Hayha, as those are some of my favorite portions of history) but would love to get some insight from any Finns out there. Do any of you have relatives who were alive during this time period? I assume you studied these types of changes during this time period. It'd be really interesting to have some of your viewpoints, if any of you have anything you're willing to share! 

And, a more specific question, how is Mr. Hayha regarded in Finland? He's not very well known here (sadly, he's one of the most interesting historical figures I know of) but I assume he has the same level of reverence that someone like George Washington has here? I find your country to be extremely interesting and would love to learn a little more about your perspective.

EDIT:

Also, what are some of the more noteworthy pieces of Finnish literature that emerged during this time? We have a corresponding assignment regarding the effects of the war on Finnish literature.

Why?

Because Finland has one of the best public school systems in the world.

My goal: to travel to Finland for 1-4 weeks (I have free time between July 20- August 20) and learn about their public school system. I'd like to stay at a science teacher's house, observe their classroom, and talk to students to learn about how the United States could learn from their system.

Here's the catch: I don't know anyone from or anything about Finland! What do I do? How can I make this dream a reality?? Help me out r/finland!

EDIT

Your responses confirm some of my concerns:

* The comprehensive schools (the age range I want to teach) don't start until around Aug 15 (when my MAT program picks up again).
* Staying at a teacher's house will be very difficult without breaking the ice first. I'll look into couch surfer. 
* Your English skills are much better than my Finnish. :\
* America's distaste for socialism/welfare makes it unlikely we could ever have a public education system as good as Finland's. That doesn't mean, however, American teachers couldn't learn something.

-If anyone is from Vaasa or has been there, any recommendations on what to do in free time? I think i'm living in the university student dorms.

-Any tips on how to get people to respond in Finnish more? I probably can get by. Puhun vahan suomea (probably an understatement) and I noticed people love switching to English as soon as I have a little grammar mistake or struggle with a few words.

Thanks!

They moved there a few months ago and will be there for two years. My younger three siblings are in school and sports, so they are making friends. My dad has been coming over here longer than we have (we moved for his job), so he has friends at work and stuff. 

However, last night my mother and I went to sauna and she told me about the troubles she has been having here. My mother is not employed and doesn't attend university, so she's having difficulty meeting people. She also finds that the moral compass of a lot of people she has been meeting is not quite pointing the same way as hers (she is a strong Christian, and is irked when swearing, drugs, sex and alcohol are seen as OK whenever...that's not how she was raised) and even with the women in her coffee group, which is a group of women ""imported"" (as she says) for their husband's job, she finds that they think much differently than her on a lot of subjects she finds important.

(Please note: In America, being a housewife is considered WORK. She is not employed, but she WORKS. Even if she wanted a job, it would be hard for her. She has a degree as an Administrative Assistant, so she could be a secretary somewhere easily......BUT! She doesn't speak Finnish a lick, either, so she couldn't talk on the phone really well.)

My question really is, she's really smiley and friendly, and PRETTY!, but also louder and more talkative than your average Finn. MUCH more talkative; she tends to scare people off at first meeting with acceptable *American* greetings. How can she meet more friends that maybe have her same morals and ideals?

**TL;DR My mom's personality is awesome for making American friends, but that gives her trouble in Finland. How can she meet more Finns without scaring them off?**

For my Mother's 56. Birthday, I am planning a vacation, where the high point is expiriencing the Aurora Borealis around the last two weeks of February (18-25. February). It was something my parents wanted to do, but then my father died unexpectedly a couple of years ago.   
  
I have researched many sites, but it is hard to determine what is best, so I turn to you, who know what's up.   
  
**Which country?**  
It boils down to Luosto in Finland, Abisko in Sweden and Tromsö in Norway  
  
**Where to go?**  
Luosto has many opportunities of winter activities, even for people who do not ski. Prices for accommodation are moderate.  
Abisko has nothing except for the wonderful nature park and the famed ""blue hole of Abisko,"" a perennial patch of sky kept mostly clear by climatological effects of this inland sea and its valley. Prices are a little higher.   
Tromsö is depicted as a pulsating city with a Planetarium, Museums, Shopping and so on. The Problem is, Norway accommodation is incredibly expensive compared to the other two.   
  
Now for me, the most sympathic place is Luosto. It has a wonderful nature park, but is also a city with plenty opportunities to do ""touristy stuff"".   
  
Now, I am looking at accommodation in and around Luosto via Tripadvisor, but it is not really helpful, because most Hotels shown are 30 and more km away from Luosto and I don't know if I like that. We're not going to have a car during our stay, so we should be able to stay inside the city.   
  
Now, I am looking for information on the following things:
1. is Luosto a good place for two Tourists looking for the aurora? Are there better places in Finland?  
2. I'd like to find a nice Hotel, two single rooms, free WLAN, Breakfast, maybe some Wellness/Sauna facilities, but I have much trouble to find a decent place. Maybe tripadvisor or ebookers is the wrong place to look...  
3. if Luosto is a good place, is anyone interested in meeting up? I love to speak with and get to know people to learn more about their culture and social structure. I did that in Stockholm back in 2011 and it was really good!  
  
I hope someone can help me :-)

I have graduated from High School and have roughly a year's worth of credits in random classes (toward no particular major) at a local college and feel like I'm wasting my time there. I have always had the desire to study in Northern Europe, so after encouragement from a Finnish friend and a little research, I've decided on Finland. Now, with the goal of entering classes next Fall, I have a lot of questions to ask and a lot to arrange before packing my bags in next year. I've read through some of the other posts like this one, so I'll try not to be repetitive. Any help from persons who have already gone through this process would be perfect, and advice from native Finns would be great too! So, where to start?

Here are the main questions I have:

* Which Universities/Polytechnics have classes taught in English? Offer full Bachelor's Degrees?
* Which do you recommend? Why?
* Is tuition free for foreigners?
* Is there housing financial aid for foreigners?
* I've heard of HOAS. Do they offer flats to foreigners who aren't in an exchange program between an American &amp; Finnish University?
* Are there ANY kinds of financial aid for foreigners?
* What's a typical rent per month for a studio apartment in a city? In a college town?
* Roughly what is the cost of living? (incl. rent, food, transport, etc)
* Is there reliable, convenient public transport in the cities?
* My grades really aren't outstanding. Is it difficult to get into Universities/Polytechnics in Finland? Are they very competitive with enrollment?
* I'd like to study software engineering. I have plenty of practical experience and skill, though I have never been very great at math by the book. Do entrance exams have a heavy emphasis on mathematics?
* Do Universities/Polytechnics care more about entrance exam scores or transcript grades when considering prospective students for enrollment?
* Is it possible to take an entrance exam abroad?
* Are entrance exams uniform throughout the country, or does each school have it's own exam?
* What are some good websites to use as information resources to find out more about applying to/studying in Finnish Universities/Polytechnics?
* Which parts of Finland speak the most English?
* Is it possible to apply for different majors at the same school? Apply for the same major at different schools? Different majors at different schools?
* I've heard the Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences is a great school, does anyone have similar/opposing opinions?

I'm extremely excited about this new adventure in my life! I appreciate any help or advice regarding school, social experience, or ANYTHING relative about Finland you think I should know. I might think of more questions, so I'll either post them in responses or edit.

**A few more things to lower the amount of responses with 'depends':**

* I am not necessarily looking to transfer any college credits.
* I don't want to get into an exchange program with an American University
* My preference would probably be in cities or bordering suburbs within close distance.
* I'm open-minded about choosing a major, and I'm willing to look at all degree programs that are taught in English, regardless of subject.
* I do not want a shared apartment",,False,self,t5_2qztz,False,,,True,t3_10t0rl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/10t0rl/american_wanting_to_study_in_finland_where_to/,

The entire route was 162 km (100 miles) with shortest day being around 7 km (4.5 miles) and longest 36 km (22.3 miles).

I maybe able to post the exact route later on but the approximate route was Rantasalmi - Oravi - trip around Koloveden Kansallispuisto (national park) - Oravi - Linnansaari (part of the Linnansaaren Kansallispuisto) - Rantasalmi.


[Saimaa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saimaa) is the largest lake in Finland and also the (only) home to [Saimaa Ringed Seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saimaa_Ringed_Seal), an endagered seal with only about 300 of them left in the world. Unfortunately we weren't lucky enough to see any.

Koloveden kansallispuisto is mostly off limits for anything using motors. It's very peaceful and quiet there, only you and the nature with some occasional kayaker paddling around.


If you ever go to this area, [Oravi](https://maps.google.fi/maps?q=oravi&amp;hl=fi&amp;sll=62.593341,27.575684&amp;sspn=8.749803,28.498535&amp;hnear=Oravi&amp;t=m&amp;z=15) is pretty good base of operation for longer exploration as it's in the middle of two nice areas. Also Linnansaari is a place you would want to visit.

There were a lot more mosquitoes than usually this year, probably because the water level was meter higher than normal and there had been a lot of rain. Nothing some deterrent couldn't handle though and only a problem in few landing places.

Hopefully you like the pics and ask away if you got any questions. Finland is very good place for kayaking if you have the oppoturnity to travel here.

I just graduated with a bachelor's degree with honours in aeronautical engineering at a UK uni. I should also mention I speak no Finnish.

For the last few years I've been interested in getting some experience in a different european country before perhaps moving back to the UK, and Scandinavia always appealed to me. My SO secured a placement in Tampere so I have been looking for work either there or in a nearby city (i.e. Helsinki or Turku).

I have been browsing online job boards since mid-April and applying to anything that seems interesting and professional enough, but have received a few rejections and no offers. Ideally, I would be working a job related to my engineering studies or at least in a science orientated field. I really want to make the move but after two months without a bite, I'm starting to doubt my chances.

My questions are:

* Are there any good places to look for jobs other than what I have listed at the foot?
* Is there any general advice you have regarding job applications in Finland?
* Are there any engineering companies that I could contact directly?
* Is it possible / realistic to ask Universities for work in research?

Any other advice regarding moving to Finland would be appreciated too.

I have a few issues at the moment, and would love your opinions on some of them :)

* I am scared that I'm going to be snowed in

I've never seen real snow before. Living in the subtropics of Queensland, Australia, will do that do you. I've seen fake stuff before, but I don't know if its hard, if you can walk through it, if it melts at all... it's something so foreign to me that I can not understand how Nordic places survive under all that snow!

I'm also scared I'm going to be snowed in if I visit during the colder months. Does this happen a lot? If it does, what do you do?

* Not knowing the language

While several tourism sites have said that people should know english, I don't exactly trust them entirely. As someone with little to no knowledge of any Finish (of course I will try and learn some), how will this disadvantage me?

* I'm allergic to all manner of things

Peanuts, tree nuts, latex, penicillin... the first two are deadly, the other two can put me in hospital for days. I will obviously have travel insurance, but I want to know if allergies and the like are known in Finland. I know that I can't ever really visit asian countries because of my allergies, so I have to be careful about where I choose to go. Also, are the emergency services good?

Tonight, Turisas paid a visit to a venue in the city, so I decided to go.

Blah blah, show goes on and there is a dull moment where the singer (Mathias Nygård) says that he wants to teach the crowd some basic Finnish. He says the two most important words are (quoting him for this next part)

""Number one!, ""sik"", Finns use this to say 'hello'! Repeat after me...""sik!"" [I could be spelling this wrong, but he pronounced is ""seek""]""

After the crowd shouts ""sik"" someone says ""heil!"" and Mathias looked at him and said ""What are you? 13 years old?"" (the guy put his head down and didn't respond)

""Alright, number two! The second most important words is how we say ""cheers"", does anyone know how we say this?"" To which I shout out ""Kiipis!"" as I hold up my cup (water at the time, but it served the purpose). The band nods and the singer goes on to say, ""besides that we say ""res"" -- ""Repeat after me, res!""

""And thats all you have to know in Finland""



Are these really Finnish words? I've never heard either, but that doesn't mean that they exist or not since my Finnish is damn limited. After a few google searches I've found absolutely nothing and have just gone on to assume that he was either trolling the crowd or that they are shortenings for words that I've never heard.

I had a Finnish foreign exchange student live with me last year as well as dated a Finnish girl for a long time and have never heard them use either word.

Please enlighten me on what they mean or (if so) what the joke behind this may be?   

Thanks in advance for your help!



TL;DR -- I heard someone use the word ""sik"" for hello and ""res"" for cheers. I may be spelling them wrong but I'm curious as to what they mean or if there may be an underlying joke.

I'm a 28 year old guy from Spain that will be attending a conference in Tampere next October, and I was planning to stay in the city for 4 other days. I have been reading advice given in this subreddit and I'm really looking forwards to visiting the city.

I would like to ask you all for advice. I have traveled a lot around Europe, but it is my first time visiting a place so far to the north. So if you were so kind to help me, I would like to know:

1) Do you know of any affordable place where I can stay? I don't care about sharing a room, but I would prefer it to be close to the city center, as I don't know the language or the public transportation system. I have seen that I can find a hotel for 40-50€/night, any other options?

2) About the language, I assume most people can speak at least a little English, am I right?

3) I assume it will be cold, but I hope you don't have sub-zero temperatures on October. I heard that at least it doesn't rain a lot on October.

4) Any chance of having a good view of the aurora borealis or should I travel to the north for that?

5) I have read of some places to go visit, but do you have any suggestion for me? I like outdoors places (such as Koskenranta), I hope it's not too cold for that. Any parks, places nearby to go hiking? I'm not very interested in museums.

6) I love music. Do you happen to know if there is any music festival or concert in October? Any bars with live music? I know your country is famous for some heavy metal festivals, but I welcome any other type of music. I like rock, punk, heavy metal, techno and many other kinds of electro music, so I guess this wide variety of styles will give me some options, right?

7) I also love drinking some beer and meeting people, any good bars you would recommend?

8) As for food, I will probably be spending very little money on this, but I would like to try food I won't be able to eat when I'm back in Spain. I read a lot of love/hate comments about your famous black sausage, so I'll definitely try it. Any other food worth trying?

9) I would also like to know about you Tampere inhabitants. Do you enjoy chatting with obviously foreigner strangers? Or you usually just talk with your group of friends? Would it be weird if a tan, probably shorter than you, and black haired guy approached you and started talking to you? As far as I know, a lot of students live in Tampere, so I was guessing people were probably used to  interact with strangers.

10) Where is it OK to smoke? I guess it is like almost everywhere else in Europe and outdoors smoking is almost always fine.


I think this covers pretty much any doubt I have. Thank you for reading! And of course thank you for helping me. I can't wait to visit your country!

**EDIT** I'm back from my trip, Finland was an amazing country to visit! I met a lot of very nice people there. I was in Tampere and Helsinki and I recommend anyone from southern Europe to go see this beautiful country. I have meet some racist people, but in general people is really nice and they like meeting foreigners. I believe Finland is a pretty isolated country compared to other european countries such as germany or The Netherlands; people haven't traveled a lot and a lot of things work in their society work in a unique way, which was very interesting to me. And no one prepared me for the amount of alcohol Finns drink, I could not keep up with their pace!

Summarizing, you should visit Finland if you have never been there, you will have a good time. Thank you everyone answering in this thread, you have been very helpful!

I am Software Engineer working in solar physics research and I am kinda of a closet geek(I mostly hide it because I was raised in a ""jocks are cool environment""). I am addicted to reddit, good stories, music, and traveling.

I am visiting Finland because 2 of my best friends currently live there. One of them married a lovely Finn girl and they recently had a baby. 

As much as I love my friends, they don't like freezing weather and going out too late. Both are working and with the baby in the mix, I will probably avoid taking too much of their time.

This would be my 3rd visit to Finland and I don't really want to waste the opportunity to know more about the life, people, and places. So apart from doing the always daunting task of meeting people on the streets/trains/bars/restaurants etc etc that will more often that not give me the look of ""why the fuck are you talking to me"". I would love to arrange a meetup with some nice redditor willing to waste a couple of hours of their day.

39% North American

Ironically, SuomiTV (Literally Finland TV) and FOX (American), both have 80% of their programming from the US. This is only the free channels. I'd expect pay channels like HBO Nordic having close to 100% American content since it is American.

So I plan on moving to Turku in a couple of months to study there and I needed some advice. I was looking online to book a flight but I couldn't find anything that goes straight from my country to Finland, all available flights have at least one layover. I also found that flying straight to Turku would involve 2 layovers at the very least, plus it costs almost double the flight to Helsinki. So I thought it might be easier to travel to Helsinki on a flight with only one layover and save my time and money. I looked up the train schedule from Helsinki to Turku and found that there's a train every 2 hours or so. My question is, will I be able to get around with my luggage and take the train to Turku with zero Finnish language? Is it a good idea to take the train, or should I just take the longer more expensive flight directly to Turku?

My name is Christina, currently an MBA Creative Industries Management student at University for the Creative Arts based in Rochester, U.K. 
I'm kindly asking you who work in creative industries in Finland to complete my survey aiming to understand the relation between government support and business success.

Each of your participation will be a great contribution to this research. All data provided will be held anonymously and confidentially. The data will only serve as part of statistics for this piece of research only. I’m willing to share with everyone who participates the results.

Please click on the link below:

The survey will close on 14, July for analysis so please kindly ensure to complete it by then. Kiitos!

I'm a 23 year old preschool teacher at an English daycare in The Helsinki Area and I am completely at my wits end with trying to find Finnish classes that are rigorous in pace (or at least beyond numbers at week five) that meet after 18:00. The place I work has rotating shifts and at a minimum, 3 out of 7 weeks I'm not done with work before 17:20. i found a class in Helsinki that started at 19:00 but it went to 21:00 which got me home well after 22:00. This is too late for me because of when my shifts start.

I want a fast paced class (academic, university level if possible) primarily because I have two years of self study. I don't need to be taught in English, I just want a class that isn't a waste of my time and meets after my work hours. I have tried contacting the universities that listed tutor and private group programs as an option but never got any response. 

R/Finland what do I do? I have a permanent contract and intend on staying here for a good long time and learning the language would really help with that. Do you know of places to find a tutor or a class that would be at an academic level that doesn't meet during work hours? Paying for it isn't a problem.

I am a native English speaker, I have an A1 in German and a JLPT 3 in Japanese if that helps any.

--------

I've been to many countries now and next on my list in Finland. I'm going next month! I will be there for 10 days. I am spending roughly 5 days in each city. I'm entering in Turku and leaving from Helsinki.

I have some internet friends that live in each town to get me around/translate, but they do not get out much, so the places we see would be for them too.

What I normally do is just google cool places wherever I'm at, and then plan out some way to get to them all in my time. But since I Have reddit, I figured I would ask you. =)

**I'm interested in the following:**

**- Museums (natural history, mostly. But others too)**

**- Nature (parks, hiking, landscapes, etc.)**

**- Things related to technology**

**- some tourist traps**

**- amusement and/or themed parks**

**- Things that you think are cool but most tourists don't see for whatever reason.**


Also, I do not know anything about Finland. This is the first country I've gone to where I wanted to surprise myself, and not research too much. So any bits of wisdom you want to share is welcome. =)

So I need a laptop, got into some technical trouble here in Canada, so bottom line is that I don't have enough time anymore to buy and receive it before I leave (may 8th). I was thinking of buying one in Finland and get the tax refunded on my way out. Is this a good idea price wise?

To give an idea what I am looking for:

-I bought [this one](http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1470716&amp;CatId=4938) a couple of days ago but I have to return it due to screen failure, I like the specs tho. (End price : 1150$ CAD = 885 Euros)

We're a group of four middle-aged Swedes who took up bicycle touring a couple of years ago, and for this summer we're thinking of experiencing Finland by bike. But since none of us have much experience with Finland (outside of Helsinki, Turku and Vaasa) I'm looking for suggestions.

We like staying and sleeping outdoors, so the plan is to utilize ""Allemansrätten"" (from what I understand it follows basically the same rules as in Sweden?)

Also, we might need frequent refilling at ALKO-stores, so it's nice if those aren't weeks apart. :)

Right now, one possible route would be to start in Helsinki and bike towards Mikkili and then go west through Tampere and then down to Turku. Sound good, or too desolate? 

We've also heard the route Nådendal -&gt; Tammerfors -&gt; Vaasa -&gt; Björneborg -&gt; Nådendal are really nice?

The main plan is to experience as much of Finnish nature and culture as possible. We will be there for up to three weeks and can comfortably cover 75 km per day in average. We'll probably start at either Helsinki or Turku, but Vaasa is also a possibility to either start or end at.

So, do you have any suggestions? DO go there, DON'T go there, you must see... you should avoid... ?

Will it still be tuition free?
