So, I decided to post this in hope that some of you would learn from it, and that the knowledge you may gain will benefit you :)

Before you read on, I must point out that if you're more advanced, than you probably already know most/all of this. This is aimed towards beginners looking to learn more.

There are multiple ways to increase strength. These include (but are not limited to):

* Increasing the size of myofibrils (specifically, type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers) aka **myofibrillar hypertrophy**.

* Increasing the amount of motor units recruited for a movement

* Increasing the efficiency of said motor units

* Inter-muscular coordination
 
But first and foremost, one must understand the concept of *Progressive Overload.*

### Progressive Overload.

Before I discuss *anything else*, I must ensure that you grasp this concept. In its simplest sense, progressive overload is simply ""doing more than you did before."" In order to gain strength, progressive overload is something that ***must*** occur. Whether it comes from increasing the weight, adding more reps, or decreasing the leverage of the movement, progressive overload is not optional. 

Take the squat, for example. If you squat 225lbs for 5x5 every workout, it's quite obvious that you aren't getting stronger. At least, it *should* be obvious. So how do you get stronger? There are two really simple ways to make progress here; you could increase the volume, or you could increase the weight. Doing either one of these will put your muscles and nervous system under stress, causing them to adapt to said stress by getting stronger. This is the key concept of strength training, forcing small adaptations that over time amount to a very large adaptation. Hypothetically, if you were to add 5-10 pounds to your squat every workout, you could go from 225lbsx5 to 315lbsx5 in a matter of months. 

### Myofibrillar Hypertrophy

It's a simple concept, once you learn about it. If a muscle is stressed at a high level, the body responds by making that muscle stronger, in case it should ever have to perform such a task again. One of the many ways to do this is to increase the number of myofibrils. Myofibrils are basic units of a muscle that make your muscles move. When they receive stimuli from the brain, they contract. To explain how this relates to strength;

More actin and myosin (the contractile proteins in myofibrils) = more muscular contraction =  MOAR STRENGTH

However, hypertrophy of any kind will not occur if one does not eat an adequate amount of calories. Simply put, you cannot make more muscle with out the proper building materials. If hypertrophy is the goal, ideally one should get at least 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, and the same amount of carbs (if not more), and consume more calories than your TDEE (see the [/r/fitness FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/wiki/faq)). 

*it's the actin and myosin proteins that increase in number, not the myofibrils themselves. Sorry, I originally did this at 3:00 in the morning on little sleep.

### Increasing Recruited Motor Units

Motor units are a combination of a motor neuron and all the fibers activated by that neuron.  There are multiple types of motor units, but for strength training, we want to focus on High Threshold Motor Units (HTMUs).  HTMUs are basically what you sometimes hear referred to as *fast twitch muscle fibers*(type IIa and IIb). These are the motor units you use when you pick up something heavy.  They also happen to have the greatest capacity for strength (and hypertrophy), which is why we focus on them. Since they are primarily used when lifting heavy things, naturally, we want to train them by doing movements that require a lot of force (read: HARD).  This is why the upper rep limits for strength training tend to be 8-12 reps(fore begginers, 5-8 for everyone else). If you can do more than 8-12 reps of an exercise, than the exercise is too easy, and you are not effectively getting stronger. In addition to this, the movement should not intentionally be slowed down. I'm aware that CC instructs you to do reps at an intentionally slow pace, this is not the way to train HTMUs. The increase in the recruitment of motor units is exactly what it sounds like, the body increases how many HTMUs are used during the movement, effectively increasing the total amount of force that can be produced.  Once all of the motor units are being recruited, the body will begin to further increase strength by improving *rate coding*, telling the muscles to contract faster. 

Another factor involved in this is the inhibition of Golgi tendon organs. These are located at both the origin and insertion of the muscle, and one of the Golgi tendon organ's jobs is to limit the amount of force a muscle can produce. Strength training tends to reduce the effect of the Golgi tendon organs, allowing more recruitment of muscle fibers. According to OG, this effect is maximized when training with 85-90% 1RM. 

### Increase in Motor unit efficiency

I'm just going to take the lazy way out and quote [OG](http://shop.eatmoveimprove.com/) on this one.  ""In untrained individuals, the motor units fire randomly to recruit the forces necessary. As we further train a movement the motor cortex is able to synchronize the firing of the motor units."" - Steven Low, [**Overcoming Gravity**](http://shop.eatmoveimprove.com/), page 13.

Basically, **one big contraction &gt; a bunch of smaller contractions**.

How do we train for this?  Do the movement often. The more familiar a movement pattern is, the more efficient you will become at said movement.  Grease the groove is especially good for training this.

### Inter-muscular Coordination

I think the term ""inter-muscular coordination"" is pretty self-explanatory.  Simply put, it's the ability to coordinate all the muscles used in a movement in the most efficient way possible.  I'll use dips as an example: in a dip, the primary muscles used are triceps brachii, pectoralis major and minor, and the anterior and lateral deltoid head. If all of those muscles were to fire randomly, you would have a pretty hard time doing a dip. Since the body likes to do things in the most efficient way possible, eventually it will learn to fire the muscles in sync to make the movement easier.  This results in an increase in strength on that specific movement. This is generally only useful for beginners, or when learning a completely new movement. As with motor unit efficiency, this is best trained by doing the movement often. Grease the groove works great on this as well.


To sum all of this up, if strength is your goal, then your workout should meet the following criteria:

* The movements you do should be **hard**.  You should not be able to complete more than 8-12 reps per set.

* Try to increase the total work you do every workout. Whether it be doing one more rep or adding more weight.

* Once you *can* do 8-12 reps in one set, its time to pick a harder progression of the movement (e.g. push-ups --&gt; diamond push-ups) or add more weight.

In addition to this, you must get at least .7g of protein per pound of bodyweight to ensure proper muscle recovery, and you must get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.

One thing that I forgot to mention was rest time between sets.  For strength, you may rest as long as you need, usually 3-4 minutes, sometimes even longer.  If you would like some hypertrophy as well, keep the rest times at 1-2 minutes.

They want to know things like ""Is it ok to work out more than 3 days a week?"" or ""Why can't I spend 20+ hours a week training like the professional athletes do?"". I feel that promulgating the information needed to answer these questions would be extremely helpful.

For this reason, I want to talk about the dual factor theory of training. The theory isn't complicated and essentially states that everyone possesses two qualities: fitness and fatigue.

Fitness is the effect that you desire to get from your training (for most people here, strength) and fatigue denotes all the negative effects of working out, things like literal tiredness, soreness, damage to your connective tissues, and psychological or emotional strain. 

While working out, you accrue both fitness and fatigue.

While resting, fitness and fatigue both dissipate but fatigue dissipates approximately three times faster than fitness. Work capacity is the amount of strenuous exercise you can handle per unit of time. As your fitness increases, your work capacity increases. This is why professional athletes who've been training for 10+ years have a much greater work capacity than someone who's been doing the beginner routine for a month and can work out 20+ hours a week.

So, to summarize:

* There's nothing special about working out 3 days a week. It's just something pretty much everyone can handle.

* **The key to making good programming is giving yourself enough time off to recover from the fatigue you've induced by working out but not taking so much time off than you lose all your fitness.** If you take anything away from this post, let it be this.

* Overtraining isn't actually a thing; a better name would be ""underrecovering"". It's just a point at which you've accumulated enough fatigue to start noticing it. If you're noticing it, be sure to back off. Google ""symptoms of overtraining"" if you're not confident in your ability to recognize it.

* The amount of fatigue you can handle without underrecovering will increase the longer you've been training.

Be aware they also include some carnival type tricks in their routines (breaking cinder blocks over the body and such). Though it seems like a majority of their training is just rigorous bodyweight exercises, often in a martial format.

They had been out for 20 minutes or so when I went out to bring them in.  One of them came running up and the other was behind, shaking her head and pawing at her face.  She rounded the corner of the house, saw me and started to run at full speed.  Then it hit me.  The most retched smell I have ever smelled. EVER.  She had just been sprayed by a skunk.  And she's the run up to you and rub type.  OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT!  

I jumped up, grabbed a tree branch and preformed, what my memory recalls as flawless, an L-Pullup to muscle up, like I was evading a pack of blood thirsty zombies.  I held myself up, leaned against the tree trunk, and ripped branches off and threw them at her.  I yelled at her to get the fuck away, making sure to string as many other curse words together as I could fit in one breath, as I was taught by the Navy.  If there were judges, I'm certain they would have scored it a 9.5. For surezies.  

Anywho, a year ago, I would hating life, reaking of skunk funk, and trying to sand my skin off with a belt sander.  And pissed that I had to throw out my favorite sweats (been breaking those beauties in for 5 years now).  Today, I ninja-ed my ass into a tree without even thinking about it.

We did the [28-Day Handstand Challenge](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+BWFitness) few months ago and had great success.  When I first did this in December, I worked with 300 people and they all made significant progress on their handstand.  

When I did it again in January, we had **1600** people who subscribed and I got hoardes of emails - all really excited about making progress towards their first handstand.

Thus, I think its time to do this again.  Hopefully we can get even more people to start working on their first handstand hold.

Here's how it works:

* Read [this article](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2013/05/28-day-handstand-challenge/?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+BWFitness) that explains the basics of the challenge.
* If you want more guided direction, you can sign up for the free eBook that explains the against-the-wall progression. ([Sign up form can be found here](http://28dayhandstandchallenge.com?utm_source=challenge-post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=28-Day+Challenge+-+BWFitness), too).
* Keep a simple check-box-training-log to keep up with your commitment.

That's it.  By following this very basic program, here are some of the results we have seen:

&gt;""I just started the program - on Day 3 - and I'm surprised by the fact that I can already hold myself up there for almost the full minute without a break! I never thought to walk up the wall backwards so thanks for posting that tip with your original 28-day program."" -[porkburp](/u/porkburp)

.
&gt;"" I can clearly state, that you got me upside down, for the first time in many many years :)"" -[hexlibris](/u/hexlibris)

.
&gt;""Been doing the program and can hold for 2.5 mins against the wall, and did count of 10 (not seconds) free standing (not against the wall in any way) today.."" -[hefoxed](/u/hefoxed)

.
&gt;""An awesome program to follow and go along SL5x5."" -[olbapazem](/u/olbapazem)

.
&gt;""It's like you read my mind, ignored all the horrible things and then brought me exactly what I need.""-[peabish](/u/peabish)

People of all ages from 18 to 65 have taken the challenge with good results.

If the handstand is one of your goals, now is the time to tackle it.  Don't let anything hold you back now!

I decided to put a lower body shot in there although it isn't very impressive so no one has to ask but I find it difficult to build size in the legs with bwf. when I go to college next year (Aus) I will be using the gym as well as body weight and then move on to what I deem fit from there.

The pics were taken over the course of a week so some of the images have the face cut out and some don't.

So far I have stuck almost exclusively to Bodyweight exercise however sometimes with the added resistance of dumbbells/weighted pull-ups.

**Stats**

11KM (6.8Miles) - 49:26

Pull Ups - 30

Push ups - 70

Raised L sit - 35 seconds

Muscle Ups - 6

Squats - 250-300 depending on the day

Height - 175 CM (5 foot 9)

Weight - 64kg (141Pounds)

A year and a half ago I joined my school's Full On Fitness class for 15-16 yr olds and stuck to a program 5 days a week 80 minutes a day and these so far are my results, sorry for the lack of before pictures but I was always a skinny kid and before I started I was about 50kg.

I will be going to bed just after posting this but will answer all (most) questions/advice/criticism when I get up before/during school.

**Edit:** It is 7:42 AM where I am so I'll type my routine out when I get to school in first period or I will miss the bus. The response I have gotten to this was actually overwhelming; When I woke up I was feeling stress/nervous for today due to teenage reasons but I feel ecstatic now.  

**Edit2: My Routine**

**Sunday:** Rest, walk the dog, maybe some Parkour

**Monday:**

 Hard Circuit due to an easy weekend. tends to look like;

2 KM run from school to the park

10x Pull Up

30x Deep Squat

25x Push Up

30x Sit Up

20x Dips on Parallel Bars

25x Lunges Each Side

5 sets of this then a 2km run back to school and I usually get into a pull up competition with a few others which progresses to around 40-50 before class ends.

**Tuesday:**

 Long distance run, anywhere from 8KM-12KM

**Wednesday:** Small Aerobic Circuit

5x Pull-ups

10x Squats,lunges,push ups, dips, Calf-raises, Sit Ups.

In this circuit there is no rest between exercises and a 1.5KM run after each set, total of 10 sets.

**Thursday:**

Near our school we have a thing called the Trugga track.

1.5KM run from school to the base of the track. 3KM to the top and 3KM back down. It is basically a very steep muddy hill with a stair case built in that leads to the top. I am yet to run the entire thing including there and back.

**Friday:**

Repeat of Monday or Wednesday depending on how I am feeling.

**Saturday:** 

Rest, maybe a light jog with the dog.

Each session lasts for 80 minutes apart from Wednesdays. Monday and Tuesday nights I have an Intermediate and Advanced Muay Thai class that last 90 minutes.

I started a year and a half ago at around 5 Pull-ups, 20 Push-ups and not being able to run anymore than 2 KM.

1356748294.0,188,self.bodyweightfitness,15lsmv,Just over 6 weeks ago someone posted a (6 week long) pullup program here. I had 6 weeks to spare so I did the program. Here are my results.,JafffaCake,228,40,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/15lsmv/just_over_6_weeks_ago_someone_posted_a_6_week/,"The program in question is this one : http://harrycloudfoot.com/2012/05/11/self-experiment-barstarrz-increase-your-pull-ups-reviewed-get-mad-results-in-6-weeks/

Its a 5 day a week program, days 1-4 are different from eachother and on day 5 you pick a day from 1-4 you had the most difficulty with and repeat it. The rep ranges, variations, and rest times are very important, do not alter them.

Here are my numbers:

**Week 1:**

Day 1 - 5/5/4/4/4

Day 2 - 1/2/3/4/4/3

Day 3 - 3/3/3 pullups, 3/3/3 close grip, 3/3/3 wide grip

Day 4 - 9 X 3

Day 5 - ( I repeated Day 2) 1/2/3/4/4/3

**Week 6:**

Day 1 :11/9/7/6/5

Day 2 : 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/5/4

Day 3 : 5/5/5 Pullup, 5/5/5 close grip, 5/5/5 wide grip

Day 4 : 9 X 6

Day 5 : (I repeated Day 1) 12/10/8/6/6

As you can see my numbers have grown exceptionally. For instance doing 9x3 week 1 and doing 9x6 week 6 may not seem like much, but thats 27 total pullups to 54. And remember thats with a minute rest between each set.  

Also the program has you do a 3 sets of pushups every morning. I did do this, but since I am trying to get stronger and not better at normal pushups I started doing harder variations. I started this program doing Uneven pushups and as of this morning I can do 4 reps of 1 arm (feet together) pushups on each arm. This was a gigantic victory for me, I set this goal of 1 arm pushups for May and I just did it like it was nothing.

As for muscle gain, I can say from my own personal perspective I have put on some significant mass in my arms and my lats. My family has also noted an increase in size, the general consensus is I have finally added some shape to my pipe arms. To be honest, getting bigger wasn't my primary goal, getting stronger is, but standing in the mirror and flexing my arm and seeing a bicep is a giant confidence boost.

Finally for those of you interested in this program but don't want to quit your normal workout you can supplement it. This is what I did.

So I've decided to begin with the Bodyweight Fitness Basic Beginner Routine posted by 161803398874989.

[Routine here](http://i.imgur.com/vGeE5.png) , [Post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/12nrtf/the_basic_bodyweight_fitness_beginners_routine/).

My problem is that I have no idea how to do most of the exercises, especially the stretches. I spent 1½ hour trying to figure it out before I just went for my regular workout.

I've tried looking at the [Drills and Skills webpage](http://www.drillsandskills.com/articles/) and the [Monkey Gym](http://www.tinyurl.com/handstandpdf), but I'm having a hard time finding what I need. I'm quite lost as to how to do Band Dislocates, Camel Bends, Full Body Circles, and Front and Side Leg Swings. 

For the other exercises I'm still not sure what the Open Tuck L-sit is, and how it differs from the Tuck L-sit? The Feet-on-Floor Support, and the other ""Support""? I assume these are ring exercises of some kind?

Also, I'm guessing the Rows are different from those I know as [Incline Row](http://www.menshealth.co.uk/cm/menshealthuk/images/nk/single-arm-incline-row-micro-workout-02062011.jpg) or [Wide Row](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gn1xm1I5cU), as they are hardly bodyweight?  Does anyone have a series of videos/pictures showcasing the rows?

Other than that, I guess I should be good :)
It would be awesome to have a compilation of videos/pictures showing the different exercises, I'm sure it would make it a lot easier for most beginners like me to get started. Pictures would be best for me personally, as I can print them and won't have forgotten how to do them at the gym. If anyone has a compilation, I'd love to see it and sort through it.

Thanks for the help and a great subreddit!

Soreness or DOMS can mean a lot of different things. [Sinjy the physiotherapist helpfully talks about them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1clyah/psa_soreness_doms_the_burn_and_whether_or_not/c9ia5p3)

'The burn' is what you want to feel during an endurance workout. It is not a goal or indicator of a good workout in the context of strength.

If you're not 'feeling' pull ups in your lats enough or pushups in your chest or whatever other exercise you might be feeling in the wrong place, you might have bad form. More likely than that however is that your weakest link isn't your chest or lats or whatever you're trying to train and,  because you're always going to feel an exercise in your weakest link, that's what's happening: you're feeling it in your weakest link. Which is exactly as it should be. Training your weakest link is infinitely superior to building up your strengths and ignoring your weaknesses.

So if you can't do 10 pushups but are worried they aren't 'targeting your chest' properly, do them anyway. Your chest isn't your weak link and you shouldn't be worried about it until it is. Having show muscles isn't the same thing as being strong and you should be training movements rather than muscles anyway.

EDIT: As far as indicators of a successful workout session, I don't have any. The best way to measure your gainz is to measure your gainz. If you're getting stronger over time, your routine is working. However, to the extent of my knowledge, there isn't a feeling you can feel that indicates a gain in strength. I suspect this is because you don't actually gain any strength until later, when you're recovering.",,False,,t5_2tf0a,1366377694.0,,,True,t3_1clyah,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1clyah/psa_soreness_doms_the_burn_and_whether_or_not/,

I am only 23 but I didn't like the skinny fat body I saw in the mirror. I only did push-ups and pull-ups for 2 and a half months and these are my results:



Start: 185 cm tall, 160 lbs (4 consecutive pull-ups max)

Today: 190 cm tall, 174 lbs (12 consecutive pull-ups, 14 chins)



So I actually grew 5 cm, I didn't know my posture had gotten so terrible. I feel like my back acts as a kind of brace when I sit now feels good. As for the 14 lbs I gained, I cannot see it at all, except I can feel it a little when I put on certain clothes. I have gotten comments from family that my back looks wider. I'll see how far I can take this!

EDIT: To anyone who wants to do just pull-ups and push-ups: don't. I am wiser now and know that this is not a balanced program.

1s pic: Year and a half out of highschool (19 yrs old). Haven't lifted or anything the entire time. My body type is skinny.

2nd: 21 years old. Started bulking up. This was my heaviest at 180

3rd: From yesterday. Starting cutting weight about a month and half ago. Current weight is 174.

Background: Did a lot of sports all my life. Football, track and boxing were the main ones. Used to lift weights a lot in highschool due to sports but I haven't since I graduated. I'm 6'1.

Diet: When bulking, I ate a lot of pizza with meat toppings on it and plain McDoubles from Mcdonalds. I didn't really count calories or anything, I just ate and ate as much as I could. Also was taking creatine when I first started. When I started cutting, I basically ate the same things just less. Also stopped creatine and switched to whey protein.

Workout: All bodyweight exercises. I can't afford to go to a gym and theyre kinda far away and I have no car. Took some exercises from Convict Conditioning and basically did a lot of pushups, pull ups, and ab workouts 4x a week.

Sorry for the short summary. I didn't really count calories, protein, or anything like that. I just kinda winged it. I'm sure if I really paid attention I could improve. Thank you r/fitness and r/bodyweightfitness

Also, having a spreadsheet with the amount of sets clearly written in front of you could help alleviate many of the ""how many sets?"", and ""how many exercises?"" questions. 

So I made one. Its super simple. Just text and numbers. Its also easily customizable for your goals/current level.  

features:

* in the set cells, if you put more reps the 12 it turns red (meaning time to move on), if you put between 8-12 reps it turns yellow (time to start thinking about moving on), and if you put less then 5 it turns red (go back one)
* Workout quality box changes colors (don't really need this but its fun c:)
* made for the intermediate beginner (2 push 2 pull 1 leg)
* exercises are in the order that you would do to alternate them (to save time do push, rest 1:30, pull, rest 1:30, repeat)
* sheet 2 has progressions! Not a finished product! the progression wiki and the beginners image are slightly different. Plus there are some Big gaps in between exercises. GIVE ME SOME EDITS!!!

Editing the rep range colors is super easy and you might have to do this because while the conditional formatting carries over, I don't think you can edit it when you make a copy. Frustrating. Select column 1-21 (everything besides skill) and clear formatting. Then select again and do formatting-&gt;conditional formatting and set your ranges! if number is below or higher then X then y and if number is between x an x do y etc etc. same goes for workout quality box (be sure to do entire row!)

This is a work in progress and I want some input as to aesthetics and colors for all the different categories. Also any other relevant things that you think need to be added to another sheet please let me know and ill add it!. If you really want to do some good editing ask me and I'll make you an editor or something. Otherwise just tell me and ill do it myself.

Big thanks to prakture, sodomizingmexican and eshlow for their insight.


[Video of my 8 months of progress](https://vimeo.com/67160862).


8 months ago I injured my knee, preventing me from doing leg strength training. I decided to focus on increasing my upper body strength while my knee was injured and needed to rest for a few months. I started out only being able to do 10 push-ups on the ground and barely 10 pull-ups on a bar. After 8 months of consistent training I have come to be able to do strength exercises ranging from false-grip pull-ups to a 15-second L-sit on gymnastic rings.


Resources I used to develop a routine: comments in this subreddit, the FAQ, Overcoming Gravity and How to Build the Gymnastic Body. 


I have been doing my routine 3-4 times per week with the occasional rest weeks. I attemped to bulk after the first 2 months and have noticed significant changes. My chest and bust have increased 2"" since January. I've never really had a ""chest"" to fill my shirts and now I do, my wife has even noticed a difference and loves it! My back has made my dress shirts tighter as well. 


My basic routine has been: warm up stretching, leg lifts or planche (which I still suck terribly at) sets, L-set sets and then alternating 1 pulling exercise, 1 pushing, 1 pulling, 1 pushing and practicing stability hold sets at the end of the work out. My video just shows some samples of things I've come to be able to do. I don't want to claim to have perfect form, though I have tried to keep good form and hopefully those who do have perfect form can point out ways for me to improve. My purpose is to show those interested in bodyweight that with a lot of reading and consistent practice you can reach your goals.

1363981956.0,131,self.bodyweightfitness,1ath1v,I did a casual study on the correlation between weighted pullups and one-arm pullups. ,munginella,143,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1ath1v/i_did_a_casual_study_on_the_correlation_between/,"​Hey /r/bodyweightfitness, I though you guys might be interested in this. Last week I conducted a very casual test at my local climbing gym to determine the correlation between one-arm pull-ups and two-arm weighted pull-ups. I tested four people who could do one-arm pull ups as well as six others who could not do one-arm pull ups. The group of people who could perform one-arms were all male. Interestingly enough, within the entire group, only one *actively trained* pull-ups, and he could also perform a one-arm. For those who don't climb and are training for the elusive one-arm, it's a little bit of a slap in the face considering most of these guys got to a one arm without doing any sort of weighted training.

​Here are the results:

* Of those who could perform a one arm, ​every subject could lift **62%** of their body weight in addition to their body weight.
* Of those who could perform a one-arm, the highest percentage of body weight lifted in addition was **74%** (astoundingly, by someone who never trains pull-ups). 
* ​This subject also had the highest total weight lifted, **122.5lbs** added. 
* The highest percentage of body weight lifted without being able to do a one arm was **50%**​.

**Conclusions:** ​For climbers and non-climbers alike, I think this is useful information for those looking to someday do a one-arm pull-up. Weighted pull-ups are valuable for training the one-arm, but these results show that by no means do you have to pull an additional 100% of your body weight to do a one-arm. I think this goes to show that while weighted pull-ups are beneficial, once you reach around the 60% body weight mark it's better worth your time to start training the one-arm muscles more specifically.

Let me preface this by saying some of the results I'm seeing might just be my body remembering not to be lazy because I was doing 7 or 8 max rep sets probably two years ago.  I started out reasonably fit just not as strong as I'd like to be.

**Week 1 day 1:** 5 maximum effort sets.  I did 4/3/2/1/2. I was disappointed at how hard this was and how low the numbers were so I set my training set to 2 thinking there was no way I could do 9 sets of 3 on day 4.

**Week 1, day 4:** 13 sets of 2. Ok, two is too low, next week do training sets of three. 

**Week 2, day 4:** 8 sets of 3 but I accidentally did 90sec rests instead of 60 which didn't leave me all that hopeful for week 3.

**Week 3, day 4:** I just knocked out 16 clean sets of 3 with 60sec rests.  Where the hell did that come from?  I probably could have fought through a couple more sets but I had to get dinner out of the oven.

I also went from 12 total on Week 1, Day 1 to 22 this week.

This place has become one of my favorite subs.  There are excellent, interesting questions everyday and so many very helpful people. I've only been coming here for a month and RES already shows a bunch of you with many +'s next to your names.  It's ridiculous how much I've learned. The mantra around here about having tangible goals has really helped me to stay focused and to develop something that addresses my weak spots.

I've added hollow body work (which I was completely ignorant of just a few weeks ago) and back bridge progressions which are already paying dividends with a much better pedaling platform in out-of-the-saddle mountain bike climbs.

I'm a girl and I want to do one arm pull-ups.,munginella,150,29,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/164uvw/i_know_this_seems_impossible_but_im_a_girl_and_i/,"I've been training pull-ups seriously for about 5 months now and I can do a two-handed pull-up with 70lbs added (I weigh 140). I also have a lat pull down machine and can do a one arm pull down with 97.5lbs (70% body weight). I can almost do a negative, but I can't control it very well (almost not at all, there's a slight pause at the top and then I fall), so attempting them hasn't yielded any results.

I've attempted a dead hang OAP, and I can pull off my shoulder but I get stuck around 120 degrees (perhaps I have weak biceps?).

I've been stalled at these numbers for about 4 weeks when previously I was making linear gains. My pull-up workout looks like this:

Two-Handed Pull-Ups:

*Warmup (few sets of 5-10 body weight pull ups)

*1x3RM

*1x1RM

*3x5RM

One Arm Lat Pulldowns (right then left)

*Warmup (1 set of 5-10 at 50lb)

*1x3RM

*1x1RM

*3x5RM

Wide Pull-ups

*3x5 body weight

Also, I do a pretty standard gymnastic workout that emphasizes triceps on opposing workout days with stuff like L-sits and front lever progressions. Occasionally I do weighted exercises like overhead press, but I'm trying to get away from them. Also, I rock climb 3-4 times a week.

Any suggestions for me? Any lifts I could be adding to my workout that could help?

(Note: If you are a beginner, heed all pre/requisites in red.  This routine is better suited for people with experience.)

#Update 8-13-2013:

The planche progression section has been revamped.  Thanks to [this note by Ido Portal](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ido-portal/strength-tip-number-1-the-planche/211939012181420), it has come to my attention that Frog Stands don’t translate effectively toward Tuck Planches.

* Instead, the [Band-Assisted Tuck Planche](http://i.imgur.com/HEn62L1.jpg) will get you there faster.

* I have also added [Planche Lean](http://i.imgur.com/ZPTNeDV.jpg) as the first thing one should get used to before attempting PPPU’s.  ([Supplemental Video explains the importance of practicing Dolphin Plank and Planche Leans.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syxvuJ2stCc))

* Also added Elevated Planche Leans.  (Adding just a couple inches of elevation makes it dramatically harder, so start with small increases.)  Note: the frog-stand and its variations have been moved to the bottom of the supplemental section. ([Supplemental video using an exercise ball \(can also use a block or chair\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq65Cm6hdpw))

* In the Skill Work section, for Handstand Practice, I added the wall progressions and 3 tutorial videos.  The first, dubbed “[THE Handstand Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99OfU8SXTTo)” is by the RingFrat channel and is an extremely thorough video.  The other two videos ([#2](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/handstand-against-wall-progression-pt1), [#3](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/handstand-against-wall-progression-pt2)) are by Coach Carl Paoli from gymnasticswod.  They both say the same thing in different ways.

#Update 8-12-2013:

Leg-Day (“Day 3″) is looking substantially more badass.  It is my goal to make this section very thorough because it's commonly said bodyweight-exercises are lagging in leg work (and it's true, but the least I could do is at least cover all my bases!).

* Just added “[Cross Reverse Lunge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVXWpZ2emHA)” and a very challenging “[Behind Leg Pistol Squat.](http://youtu.be/Vs841TMp1VE?t=2m8s)” (cued at 2:08, also example at [3:26](http://youtu.be/Vs841TMp1VE?t=3m25s))

#Update 7-29-2013: 

* Added [“Bird Dog”](http://i.imgur.com/Fjm4tqj.jpg) to bodyline exercises. Also, the more advanced version is [Bird Dog from Plank](http://i.imgur.com/ZDoTTB1.jpg) position.  Work on building up the regular bird-dog before trying the plank version. (Funny aside: In Denmark they call them “Hitlerhunden” which means “The Hitlerdog”).

* Also, on the Dips (Rings) section, I added videos ([progressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnEmGzx0Oc) and [form check!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXdRGotG3so)) to help you transition between P-bar dips and ring dips as the difficulty increase is quite dramatic.

#Update 7-28-2013:

* Add a “[Pull to Inverted Hang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrlNLF-XkJI)” to your pulling routine for even more front lever dynamics.  Follow the usual progression protocol: First get used to doing it while tucked, then advanced tuck, then with one leg straight, then finally, from a straight front lever position for ultimate badassery.  In the video he does it from a L-hang position, which is yet another variation.

#Update 7-21-2013:

* Add this “[Seated Elevation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMEDFIwkGmI)” exercise to your L-sit progressions.  Even if you’re not as flexible as the man in the video, bringing your legs as high as you can will still activate the core.  Note how he rapidly brings the legs up and purposely lowers them slowly.  That’s the key to making each rep count.

#Update 7-17-2013:

* Added [Casio watch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002J4UBJ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002J4UBJ0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=antranikorg-20) recommendation in supplemental section to use as countdown timer to hit your isometric holds and rest times.  The watch has a feature that automatically repeats the countdown timer.  This has made my workouts super-duper-efficient.

#Update 7-1-2013:

Added explosive workouts to the Leg section:

* [Deck Squats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncVRPnyWnVg) and [Squat Tuck Jumps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ17ap1Khpo).

* After you master 3×10′s of those two, we combine the two to do 3×5-8 of [Jumping Tucked Deck Squats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8mqax2lF68).

* Then take it a step harder with [Jumping Deck Pistol Squats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujo-xTeLmiU) (do Pistol Squats as your warm-up set).

* Also adding [Inverted Hang Pull-Ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s3KEYtHE9E) to One Arm Pull Up progression.  

#Update 6-29-2013:

* Added [False Grip Hang](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/false-grip-progressions-pt1) and [Russian Dips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtXMZgQOOpE) to the Muscle Up Progressions.  This should tremendously help build a much more solid foundation before trying strict or kipping muscle ups. [More details here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1hbsns/new_prerequisite_for_muscle_ups_false_grip_hang)

#Update to supplemental sections

* I have added slackline specific exercises, which I understand is irrelevant to people who don't have a slackline, but if you do, it's an EXTREMELY powerful tool! The slackline moves so much, it wakes up and calls for more stabilizer muscles, the same way the rings do when you first transition to them from a p-bar.  Try bird-dog, L-sit, peacock pose and shoulder stand on it!  Yogaslackers on youtube is the business in this regards.  If you could do an L-sit while keeping a slackline still, it becomes ridiculously easy on the ground.  

There are also more random intermediate/advanced moves in the supplemental section now such as...

* [Reverse Pullover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuPSoMRwQF0) (Pulling)
* [Korean Dips](http://youtu.be/wzg_guVxYZM) (Pushing)
* [Back Support](http://youtu.be/QRJBDzFCnA8) (Support)
* [Toes To Bar](http://youtu.be/WvNQGX6gIjI) (Core, helps with the kip)
* [Knees to Elbows](http://youtu.be/jNbjurAiZK4) (Dead Hang)
* [Knees to Elbows](http://youtu.be/jNbjurAiZK4) (Kipping)
* [Gymnastics Kip](http://youtu.be/jNbjurAiZK4) (Skill)
* [Elbows to Knees](http://youtu.be/c0KIxrAHzyQ) (Core)
* [One Arm Toes to Bar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEV28ms0OEA) (Core)

The following progressions used to be part of the Planche Progression, but have been removed and placed here now:

*     [Frog Stand](http://smittenblog.com/storage/bakasana.jpg) (aka [Crow Pose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW4NYacLCKg))
*     [Advanced Frog Stand \(aka Crane Pose\)](http://askinyourface.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/crane-pose-bakasana.jpg) (straight elbows, put knees high up on triceps)
*     [Advanced Frog Stand with Hip Extension](http://www.globalbodyweighttraining.com/wp-content/uploads/Frog-Stand-with-Hip-Extension.jpg)
*     [Elbow Lever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-nPixlxjk8) (aka Peacock Pose) (more of a balancing move than pure strength)

I've recently started Convict Conditioning. I just went to the iTunes app store to see if there was an app that would help me track my progress, get alerts and reminders, etc. Basically something to help me stay on track.

Unfortunately there is only one app in the store for it, and it's incredibly basic. In addition, it's a bit overpriced.

I am strongly considering writing my own Convict Conditioning app and I am wondering if this is something that would be of interest to people in this subreddit? If it is, I will do it ""properly"" so it can be released to the general public, rather than being an ugly little tool for my own personal use.

If this is an app you would like, I would greatly appreciate if you could respond with an affirmative and, if possible, a list of features that would make it worthwhile to you. If you wouldn't mind, I'd also love to hear what you'd be wiling to pay for an app that meets your CC needs.

I told him that the /r/bodyweightfitness community really **needs** organized videos for progressions relating to push/pull/legs, as well as for individual moves like the muscle up and handstands.

So, within a few hours, he created some playlists from his HD movies split up into push/pull/legs, and some for single exercises like Handstands and Muscle Ups.

Here are the links with the videos that would likely interest this subreddit:

* [Muscle Up Exercises](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQMjDhKymrRi_0ZMt8KcMnj3NSEOWmDs)
* [Handstand Exercises](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQMjDhKymrSou1-yRD9vUHZM2mCaOLMj)
* [Bodyweight Pushing Exercises](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQMjDhKymrTsVaLzDyMPv4e1Q_bxpIZI)
* [Bodyweight Pulling Exercises](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQMjDhKymrS2rCOjDdgvvtL9F5SMIrfx)
* [Bodyweight Leg Exercises](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQMjDhKymrR31DEjqvbDjF918RN23KeI)
* [ALL Playlists](http://www.youtube.com/user/DemonDrills/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=1)

Ryan's videos normally are very location independent, and can be done anywhere (one video is for tuck planches between a wall and a parked car, for example).  Great for people who travel to get ideas.

Hope you guys find this useful.

Which got me researching.  Which brings me here.

The OP in the previous post asked why endurance training was so frowned upon in this subreddit.  Our helpful BWFers answered that it was more a case of working towards your own goals; and that if hypertrophy and strength were amongst those goals, endurance training wouldn't provide the most efficient path.  All true of course, but some in the thread expressed their enthusiasm for endurance training.  This is where the research comes in with an interesting insight.

Essentially, unless you're already a [very high level competitor](http://www.sportsci.org/news/traingain/resistance.html) in your chosen endurance sport, the addition of strength training to your training regimen will actually improve your endurance.

Some studies have even found that high level athletes can still see an improvement in endurance through strength training if the exercise has some [specificity to the sport](http://www.saskathletics.ca/pdfs/maximal%20strength%20training%20improves%20aerobic%20endurance%20performance-Hoff.pdf).

The news is even better for the typical new-to-fitness poster in this subreddit.  If you're just starting out the sweet effect of [newbie gains](http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/strengthening/a/aa123098a.htm) will see an increase in your endurance even if you're training strength.  Even if you're already at a steady-state performance level in your chosen endurance pursuit, this [oft-cited study](http://jap.physiology.org/content/65/5/2285.short) suggests that strength training at worst will not harm performance and will more than likely increase short term endurance in the 4-8 min window as well as increase the likelihood of a VO2 max increase if you're a cyclist and you're training legs.

What does all this boil down to?  Unless you're at such a high level in your chosen pursuit that only improvements in technique can improve your performance, strength training will only serve to increase your endurance.  For mere mortals it's not either/or, it's a mutual benefit.

Many people come in /r/bodyweightfitness  and ask questions that can be answered just by reading the FAQ

Yet the same people claim to have read the FAQ.

Since these people would not lie about reading the FAQ the only explanation  i can think is that after the FAQ has been read 

the alien UFO mothership is sending strong brainwaves that erase the knowledge from the minds.

That is why is people having read the FAQ ask questions that are answered in the FAQ.

That is why strong protection is needed. After having read the FAQ 
and then asking questions coming straight from the FAQ please place 
a strong aluminum tinfoil hat straight on the head and reread the FAQ.

If this is not effective  then while still wearing the tinfoil hat 
stand on the corner of your room with one feet on the air and reread the FAQ as loud as you can .

This is certain to be 100 % effective  .

I've been at it for two months, and with the help of the FAQ routines and the veteran posters, I'm down to 172 lbs from 222 lbs while getting my first real pullup and chinup since my labrum in my shoulder was repaired. 

For those that are interested in my diet, I eat mainly a Japanese diet (My wife does all of the cooking). 

**Breakfast:** 3/4 cup Rolled Oats with dash of salt and some dried fruit (Cranberries, Currants, Raisins), and a Boiled or Fried Egg. If I'm in a rush, I'll have a Turkey Bacon and Egg on wheat toast from the food truck outside of my office

**Lunch:** Whatever was left over from dinner, unless we eat fish for dinner. Mrs. Crowley will cook something with beef or chicken then fill my lunch box up with brown rice, salad and japanese side dishes. If she doesn't cook, I'll get a grilled chicken pita w/ no sauce from the food truck. 

**Dinner:** Fish 4-5x a week, Beef or Pork 1x a week, Chicken 2x a week with various Japanese side dishes, Miso Soup and Rice. 

**Snacks:** Apples w/ Peanut Butter, Green Smoothie w/ Hemp Protein, Nuts, Carrots, Celery etc. The occasional Oatmeal Cookie, or Biscotti if my wife makes them.

Where I was going wrong was too much alcohol, and snacking on garbage between meals. 

Now that my initial goals have been accomplished, I'm pushing through on getting stronger and stronger. I'll take a picture of myself tonight, and in another few months I'll do a before and after :)

I had been GTG with pull-ups, tried weighted for a while, then stopped training because of school, started again after finals, stopped again, etc. etc. etc.

A week before Ramadan started, I went on vacation with my family. On vacation, I ate mostly junk, didn't sleep too well, didn't train, but overall I was having fun with my family (this was our first vacation in about 5 years).

After coming back from vacation (on the second day of fasting), I was at the gym with my nakama and he told me to just do a muscle-up, and to my surprise, I actually got it! And then I did it one more time, and then failed several. **[My friend recorded my first attempt on the third set](http://youtu.be/aRKUBAUQUBs)**.

The point I'm trying to make is that sometimes you may physically be able to perform a skill, but being mentally stressed (which I was due to school, work, finals, etc.) can lead you to fail. Sometimes taking a vacation and having fun can be what you need

I know many people can do kipping muscle-ups and that this may not be major for some, but this was a goal that I thought I might not be able to accomplish at this point, and being able to come to the gym and just doing it was a great feeling.

**TL;DR:** stop stressing out, be happy, achieve goals

""Train movements, not muscles"" sure is a catchy phrase, but it's not the be-all end-all of things. There is a number of very real situations where it is not applicable (rehab, for instance). I highly encourage you to keep an open mind towards other training methodologies, and to get your information from anywhere and everywhere. This doesn't mean you should trust anyone on the pretty blue colour of their eyes, but keep an open mind.

In general I'm a really nice guy, but should you choose to apply ""movements, not muscles"" in a dogmatic manner, I will buy a shotgun, find out where your live, and personally blast off one or possibly two of your feet. You've been warned.

With that out of the way, let's get down to it. Here's what I want to argue:

*Concerning yourself with the capabilities of your muscles rather than your ability to perform movements is usually overcomplicating simple matters and leads beginners to do stupid shit*

Once you get a bit further into training and learn a bit more about how the body works and all that, the distinction between training movements and muscles becomes more of a false dichotomy. Not that's it's a bad way of thinking or anything, you just start to see the nuances and different situations and whatnot. Anyhow, if you're at that point, or when you get to that point, you'll know.


**Less Is More**  
Thinking about moving is inherently simple: you've got pushing, you've got pulling, you've got a couple of directions you can do it in and that's about it. It's a very natural thing. If you want to describe a deadlift to someone, you say ""pull something up from the floor"", and they instantly know what you mean. Had you said ""short quad contraction to extend the knee followed by major effort from the hamstrings and glutes to extend the hip while the erector spinae and latissimus dorsi isometrically contract to stabilise the trunk"", you would've lost most of them at ""quad contraction"".  
Of course, noone in their right minds would describe a deadlift like that. However, it serves to illustrate how movements are easier to understand and communicate with.

Basing your programming around movements works pretty well. 2 pushes, 2 pulls and leg work will cover pretty much all bases for most people. So why overcomplicate things by worrying about hitting your trapezius if you're making progress towards your goals?  
Of course, once you get a bit more advanced and start running into problems, exposing real weak links [1], you can consider which muscles are involved and what may be worth working on specifically. Not to say that it's absolutely necessary. After working a lot with neutral and supinated grip pulling, I found I was weak in pulling with a pronated grip. So what did I do, isolate my brachioradialis? No, I simply did a bunch of pronated grip pulling and that worked just fine.

Then there's structural balance: you want certain muscles to be stronger than others, so you have to isolate them, right? No, not necessarily I don't think. You see, your body evolved to move. As long as you are moving correctly (whatever that may mean), the right muscles get strong in the right amounts, and you don't have to worry about the strength of your rear delts or rhomboids. If you have an imbalance, then it could be a good idea to isolate those muscles, but if you follow a sensible training program, that is unlikely to happen.

Furthermore, a lot of people's goals are movement based: ""I want to do a muscle-up"", ""I want to do a planche"", ""I want to do an L-sit"", ""I want to move better"". Instead of trying to work on individual muscles that are involved in that activity, why not just work the movement itself? The SAID principle (specific adaptations to imposed demands) states that the body gets better at what you ask of it. If you do a lot of pullups, you specifically get better at pullups. If you move a lot, you get better at moving. Kind of obvious, really.  
Not being strong enough to perform the movements is not an excuse. You can scale anything down to absolute rock bottom. Can't do planche isometrics? Do planche leans. Can't do planche leans? Do planks. Can't do planks? Do planks on an incline. Can't do planks on any incline at all (even against a wall)? Okay, you got me. I highly advise you to see a physio ASAP.  

What if you are a runner? Squatting and deadlifting is very helpful for running, but they don't really look like running much. So why would squats and deadlifts be good? ""To train the quads, the glutes and the hamstrings"". Yeah, or just ""to make your legs stronger"". Anyone can see how that works: running is something you do with your legs when you want to go somewhere quickly [2], so getting stronger legs will help out. That's the entire point: thinking about muscles is just overcomplicating things.  

**Beginners**  
I'd like to point out that I don't think beginners are stupid or anything; they simply haven't build up the requisite knowledge, and I think you should accept that. Of course, there's a special kind that doesn't read the FAQ and posts questions that we all dislike, but let's not consider those for a bit.

If a beginner makes a program based around training muscles you get shitty workouts consisting of only pushups, curls, sit-ups and calf raises, because abs, pectorals and calves are all the beginner knows. Sure, it's better than not working out at all, but it's still a horribly ineffective workout for both performance and size gains. A beginner knows not nearly enough about his body to create a good workout based on the principles of hitting muscles, and you'll have to teach him a bunch about how to body works and what exercise involves what muscle, and then they have to parse and store all that information, which takes a while, and all the time they start doing shit like adding exercises for their forearms and rear delts, while forgetting they also have lats.  
Virtually everyone understands the principles of ""pulling"" and ""pushing"", so why not use those terms to teach beginners how to create a proper program? It's easy and gets them going fast. You can worry about muscles later.

Then there's also the issue of ""weak links"" with beginners. Beginners often feel they are lacking in the biceps, in the traps, or, most commonly, in the chest. A particular pet peeve of mine is beginners posting in /r/bodyweightfitness asking about ""how do I train my pecks"" because they ""are a weak link"" or ""lack size"". Partly because ""pecks"" is the plural of a basic Flying-type Pokémon move and not a muscle, but mostly because their chest isn't a ""weak link"" or ""lacks size"". It's just overall weakness and lack of size that is the culprit, and their overall shape is what they should be working on. Worrying about the chest isn't going to do a beginner any good.

**Nuances**  
Like I mentioned above, ""train movements, not muscles"" is not dogma.  
For instance, during rehab you want to use isolation movements in order to strengthen the thing that's injured because you want to be able to very precisely control the load. Likewise, you may eventually run into a plateau during your regular training and need to bring up strength in one specific muscle in order to get everything moving correctly. Or if you're bodybuilding and lack in size of a specific muscle.  
The common factor in these situations is that *something is off*. Plateauing isn't the end of the world (though it can certainly feel that way), but it's still something you want to prevent. The point I'm trying to make is that if everything is going as it should, why complicate things?

**Conclusion (finally!)**  
Anyhow, I hope that was convincing/enlightening and thanks for reading this wall of text. Normally I'm inclined to say ""fuck TL;DR's"", but this post is already over 1500 words long, so I've provided one below.


**TL;DR**  
*Concerning yourself with the capabilities of your muscles rather than your ability to perform movements is usually overcomplicating simple matters* because:

* Thinking about pushing, pulling and a couple of directions is easy to understand and covers most bases
* Structural balance takes care of itself if you train movements
* Most people's goals are movement based

*It's also something that leads beginners to do stupid shit* because:

* A beginner knows only a couple of muscles, and teaching them how the body works takes a long time 
* Beginners tend to leave out important parts of the body in favour of the more superfluous things
* Beginners always think they have weak links or lack size somewhere, but it's rather their overall body that is weak or lacks size

THIS IS NOT DOGMA, THINK FOR YOURSELF

Can someone explain to me like I'm 5 how to get to do a free standing handstand?**

Hey all, Handstands have been ALWAYS one of those things that make me DROOL and would make me SUPER PROUD if I could do

**About Me:**

 * Male
 * Height: 5'7"" (170cm)
 * Weight: 172lbs (78Kg) (YIKES!)

**About my Physical Condition:** I tried out the [BW666](http://www.fitness666.com/p/bodyweight-666.html) program a couple of days in January, but quickly lagged behind and then stopped again. I used to do a LOT of CrossFit last year (don't judge me, peer pressure) and still go running (5k ~30min) and cycling 2-3 days a week

**My current strength 'feats' from 3 weeks ago:**

 * 6x6 pushups
 * 6x30sec handstand, facing the wall
 * 6x3 chinups
 * 6x6 hanging knee raises
 * 6x6 dips with legs on floor
 * 6x6 bulgarian split squats

That is all. My dream is to be able to do a handstand by July (birthday) and perhaps keep practicing to be able to do a handstand walk before the end of the year? Is that too ambitious?

I know there is the FAQ on the side bar, and I have gone through it, but as far I could tell, it was mostly about increased strength (which I'm sure I'll need) but did not include much on the balance side of things?

Also, it would be awesome if there were other feats of gymnastics that I could also achieve in a 6 month frame that you could tell me of. Like maybe L-Sits or something like that?

The problem with the lunch hour workout is that after getting changed, getting to the park, eating lunch etc I am only left with 30-35 mintues of working out time.   I want to continue to develop my skills and strength and hope the below sort of split might fit;

Monday: Muscle-ups (practice can quite do one), pull-ups, front levers,
 
Tuesday: Dips, back levers, press ups, hanging leg raises, l-sit

Wednesday: Pistol squats, back bridges, one arm hangs, elbow levers,

Thursday: Muscle-ups (practice can quite do one), pull-ups, front levers,

Friday: Dips, back levers, press ups, hanging leg raises, l-sit

In addition I will do handstand and elbow lever practice most evenings and on the weekend I may try and repeat the Wednesday workout.  If I miss a lunchtime workout due to work commitments or rubbish British weather it wont be so difficult to fit in the scheduled half hour workout in the evening!

1367844437.0,87,self.bodyweightfitness,1dsezq,The first negative review of Ido Portal I've come across. Any more out there? Might be of interest to people considering his online coaching.,red1392,106,19,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1dsezq/the_first_negative_review_of_ido_portal_ive_come/,"So looking through some old threads on Ido, I came across this post. OP seems to have deleted his account and considering he posted a whole 2 months after the thread was started, his reply probably hasn't got very many views. I figured it'd be worth reposting, though, especially for people who may be considering paying $1000 for the 3 months of online coaching.



&gt; Hi,
I thought for the sake of balance it was time that someone that has had a negative experience with Ido put something out there. I was also a fan of Ido and his impressive feats of bodyweight strength also his no nonsense approach. 

&gt; Before I start let me give you some background on me I have been training with traditional weights for a long time and had achieved reasonably impressive results Im 5 10' and have weighed in at 90kg with 6% bodyfat so I understand training and also hard work. However the type of training that I did also brought with it a range of problems to quote Ido himself a BMW body with a volkswagen's performance. Extremely tight hips, tight shoulders and a range of other mobility issues.

&gt; A year or two ago I started moving slowly to more bodyweight orientated training after seeing some videos of hannibal for king and finding the website gymnastics bodies. I started messing around mostly with no clear understanding of what I was doing. After stagnating and becoming frustrated with the lack of resources available that were individually tailored I finally decided to bite the bullet and fork over the money to try Ido's 1 on 1 online coaching. 

&gt; As I said earlier Ido is in fantastic shape and has some amazing marketing abilities but his online coaching was probably the greatest waste of money I have ever spent in my life. To start with for $1000 you don't even get an individually tailored program I bet I could post my program and It would look exactly the same as the guy who gave it a positive review. To highlight this fact I explained in detail my lack of shoulder flexibility prior to starting what was to be my first 6 week program. Included in that first program was a elevated bridge, no progressions no specific shoulder stretches just 5 sets of 30s bridges, as though he hadn't even read my email. Also when he sends you your first program he dosen't even send videos of the specific moves he has precribed. You have to go and try and find them yourself on youtube. He has plenty of time to film himself doing one arm handstands but no time to film himself doing examples of the exercises he has prescribed to people who have paid him $1000. You then film your exercises he gets back with a few one line responses to them and that's supposedly it until the 6 week mark. I can honestly say the effort he would have given my initial program would have been perhaps 10 mins. 

&gt; After questioning him on some of the above issues you are made to feel as though you are weak and he could barely be bothered responding to your question. I eventually just gave up and notched it up to experience. He even boasts about the fact that people pay him this ludicrous sums of money and then just disappear, well we disappear because we feel ripped off and what course of redress to we have because we have paid up front. Im not sure there are many coaches out there who are proud of the amount of people who are so dissatisfied they give up $1000. I am tired of hearing all the bullshit about how he is too busy to respond to emails yet he constantly is telling people how he trains 6 hours a day. Well he can train 6 hours a day because he gets suckers to pay him $1000 and then makes them feel bad if they expect any of his time, and ridicules anybody as being weak if they can't do what he does. 

&gt; I have read alot of his work he has also previously stated that online coaching is rubbish yet again he is happy to do it and willing to take your money. I also love the fact that every so often he takes somebody who was a stuntman, or an acrobat and brags how they have progressed so far with him. If he is so sure about his methods why not offer a money back guarantee perhaps because so many people would ask for their money back he wouldn't have time to train 6 hours a day anymore.

&gt; I will let everybody make up their own mind but here is a summary of the facts. For $1000 up front you get 2 generic cookie cutter programs of which you have to find video's and descriptions of the exercises yourself online, you get an initial email with your programming as well as a review on the videos you submit. Then at 6 weeks you get another program and another review. At most I would guess he spends an hour of his time on you and that is being generous. $1000 an hour is pretty good money to pay someone who reckons there too busy too answer questions. 

&gt; If people are really interested in bodyweight training then there best bet is to go and look at the resources available on gymnasticsbodies.com. Christopher Sommer is where Ido got most of his ideas from anyway and for a fraction of the cost you will get much more in depth information as to how to progress towards your goals and a community who is supportive of you no matter where you lie in terms of your performance.

A while back I asked a question here about lower body exercises beyond the pistol squat.  Some good discussion was generated about using plyometrics and sprints to build power.  Since that post, I've come across some videos of single leg squat variations that I wanted to share with the r/bodyweightfitness community. Some of them are unexpectedly difficult, and I think they might be useful to those of us looking to keep progressing beyond the pistol squat.

Many of you are already familiar with ""the shrimp"", but for anybody who isn't: [the shrimp beginner and intermediate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpgn6eRtsdw) and [the advanced version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EJtZsA43vI).  Both are by Ido Portal.

Pistol Squat variations:
The second variation in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0s-0vlHwLc&amp;feature=player_embedded) is called a ""renegade pistol"".  Personally I have found it surprisingly difficult.

[This guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzond9erQsk&amp;feature=player_embedded) demonstrates another variation that involves jump switching legs at the bottom of the squat.  He also does a squat similiar to the beginner version of the shrimp, but he doesn't appear to actually touch his passive leg to the ground from what I can tell.

[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeggUI8s9fM&amp;feature=player_embedded) shows a variation starting at the bottom of the squat in a seated position.  At 1:25 he switches to sitting on both legs.  

[Three more variations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4TItHzz0VMw).  The last one appears to be a version of the allusive ""warrior press"" that I asked about in an earlier post.

[Twister pistol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=The_YYrL24M&amp;list=UUGj8AXmVRz7d2wkJj_xP5ZQ&amp;index=41&amp;feature=plcp)  I haven't tried this yet, so I'm not sure how it compares to the non-twisting version.

[Five more variations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDhxwtkhtA8)  The first three seem to be playing with starting and stopping the movement in different places, the fourth is from a seated position, and the last one is springing up from the back onto one leg.

[Pistol squat walk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urQs6SMn60k)  This doesn't really add anything new to the movement itself, but I thought I would include it anyway.

No video of this one, but I've started working on pistols on my toes, which changes the orientation of the leg somewhat and is quite difficult (for me, at least).

**EDIT:** I left off [Alkalvadlo's variations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDzWem7CfIg)  He plays with changing the position of his arms.

These aren't squats, but for glute and hamstring strength:

I have been rock climbing for a little over 3 years now. I’ve always trained opposing muscles to prevent injury, and I’ve recently found this subreddit. I’ve read the FAQ and the wiki section, and I've created a workout program that I want to share. My goals are to prevent climbing injuries, and, as of right now, I also want to be able to do a handstand and a flag. With my pulls and pushes I’ve been using the [G-string climbing grips](http://sicgrips.com/Design.html), [Image](http://i.imgur.com/P78rVNL.jpg)
I’ve also uploaded a couple videos, of me doing a [handstand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj9y-y6_5Zg)  and [L-sit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=058d0eqZ5R0), to see how my form looks. In the handstand you will see me kind of waving back and forth a little. That is because I am working on taking my feet off the wall. In the L-sit video you can’t see my feet, but I am lifting both of them off the ground. This was a spontaneous thing, so if the quality is bad I would happily make another recording. I only work opposing muscles once or twice a week. I do plan to mix up my workouts as I progress and my body adapts to my fitness level. Please give suggestions or advice on anything that will help. Before Going any further, I just want to give a big thanks for everyone out here making this subreddit the way it is. The FAQ and wiki are amazing, and make a great reference for workouts. I only wish the rock climbing community was this way (at least where I live).

I’ve also found [Gold Medal Bodies](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ruB7qtdk4KufASPRuWhZA) a great resource for learning how to do a proper handstand. I’ve also plan on building me parallette bars to further practice my training.

This would be a Moronic Monday question, but I was inspired to post from something I read on the subreddit today.

Bottom Line Up Front question:  What should a beginner do to work on the L-sit progression if that is the current weakpoint in the bodyweight training scheme?

Background:  Been reading /r/fitness and /r/bodyweightfitness for a while and I've been working on the beginner progressions.  I purchased Overcoming Gravity and it mentioned to focus on the weak areas of progression, which for me is the L-sit progression.  I've been working on the tuck L-sit (and purchased parallel bars), but it's tough going so far.

My main sport has always been soccer and my center of gravity is pretty low (I am fantastic at limbo, btw) and I have decent leg muscle but not much upper body muscle.  A post I read today said that early on, the L-sit isn't ""skill"" training but ""strength"" training.  It's tough for me to pull my legs up into the tuck.  I assume that this is a core strength issue.

Current routine: (Set x Rep/Hold)  
Wall Handstands 3x35sec  
L-sit Practice: 60 seconds  
Push-Ups (Approaching Diamond) 3x4  
Bent Knee Table Horizontal Rows 3x8  
Pull Ups 3x(2 + 2 neg for 3 sec)  
Ab Wheel Roll-Out from Knees 3x8  
Standing Squats (No weight to practice form) 3x8  


TL;DR  Currently weak and L-sits aren't skill, but strength training.  What should I be doing?

I've noticed a few threads where people are describing their difficulty getting that elusive, first pull up or increasing their number of pullups past the range of motion failure point. The simplest way my colleagues and I used to train people to overcome this was to substitute three ""pulldowns"" whenever a pullup was called for in their workout.

This consists of leaping (or using a chair) to the achievement point of a well executed pullup, i.e. where your chin has cleared the bar, and then slowly letting yourself down to full extension over a three count. Repeat that a total of three times,  and your body will have put out a similar level of exertion as one, actual pullup. Plus, it's easy to increase the difficulty: just lengthen the duration of your count (e.g. five seconds versus three) or reps (e.g  five versus three ""pulldowns"" substituted for one pullup).

Other than simplicity, the biggest advantage of this approach is that it preserves the range of motion of a pullup, which is the skill you want to acquire in the first place, right? I used this approach when I first started using simplefit nearly a year ago after having fallen so far out of shape that I could only do two, good pullups in a row. My personal best is now twenty-three pullups with solid form.

(I'm on mobile so no sidebar, but looking forward to checking out your FAQ!) 

You guys rock. Seriously. Everything I've read has been so incredibly supportive and knowledgeable. As I read the threads on this sub I get a real honest sense of compassion and mutual respect for one another. That's all I've been looking for. (and it's definitely one of the things I've missed about my old climbing group). 

I've subbed and can't wait to get involved, contribute and learn. 

For myself, I'm a 33 yr old former indoor Rock Climber who used to be a healthy 28 year old. I spent years building up to climbing 5-10s and 5-11s at 210lbs (I'm 5'11"") but then I got injured, lost my climbing group and my gym closed - pretty much in that order. :S

I went through about four/five years of heavy sedentary living (got married, had a kid) and just recently - as in a few months ago - got sick and tired of getting winded climbing a single flight of stairs. My weight topped out at 242lbs. I joined /r/p90x and just completed that last month (on my second go-round now) and have gotten back down to 218 but I've been officially bitten by the fitness bug. 

I've also been experimenting with bodyweight training through a book called Convict Conditioning and my pushups and squats are progressing nicely. 

But after looking around here I can see just how intro all that is. A good start, but I get the sense that this place will definitely help take me further. 

Haven't quite decided what my end goal is yet, I can feel like I'm on the cusp of getting back to where I was at 28... So I guess my goal is to see how far I can push it and how long I can maintain it. Ideally I'd like to be an 'in amazing shape' 90 year old. 

Anyways, I wanted to pop on by, introduce myself and... Hell yeah, let's get started :D

“Throughout the day you need to send constant signals to your body, so that it adapts in the direction you point it in. It’s better to do 10 press-ups every hour than 100 in a single burst. If you do things often enough, your body adapts for the task you set it, and you evolve.”

What is the general thought consensus about this among the group? I tried this type of training for a bit when I worked from home last year. Every hour or 2 I'd knock out push ups and pull ups and things rather than do a solid workout in the evening. It seemed like I was pumped for most of the day rather than feel like I was putting on more muscle.

100% of my weight loss so far, I attribute to me following a strict diet for 4 months.

Now that I'm in, relatively, better shape I've been looking to start building muscle and generally getting stronger. Weird thing happened though, when I started doing push-ups I realized that I can only do ONE set of 5 reps. I went down for another set, but I couldn't push back up again so I held bottom position for about 5 seconds then gave out. 

I got into push up position later and put my arms on a balance to see how much exactly I'm pushing and it pointed to 220 pounds. Now I know this includes the weight of my arms, so it isn't exactly accurate. But give or take, I'm pushing about 200 pounds. 

So my question is basically the title. And if I'm just super weak, then how do I get stronger if I can hardly do 1 set of 5? I was intending to follow the beginner routine posted in the FAQs.

http://shop.eatmoveimprove.com/

Notes and plans:

1. It is a fully searchable, digital PDF that can be loaded on an eReader (Nook, Kindle, Kobo, etc.), iPad, Tablet or viewed on the computer. It has no digital copyright protection and is a non-encrypted, fully commentable, bookmarkable, copy/pasteable PDF for $49.95. The only thing disabled is page extraction. An excel version of the Overcoming Gravity charts is also provided. The main file is approximately 100 MB, and the excel 28 KB. Any future changes or corrections are provided at no cost.

2. For those who have previously purchased the book, PM me a picture of your book and I'll shoot you the coupon code for 25% off.

3. Coupon code ""holidaycheer"" without the quotations is a available until January 31st for $5 off. Coupons are not stackable from what I'm aware.

4. Overcoming Gravity 2nd edition is planned for late 2013/early 2014 tentatively. OG digital edition was my priority project right now, so I'm just about to start constructing and editing materials for OG2. Feel free to give me any suggestions or comments.


**edit**... since some people asked:

These are the proposed changes for OG, subject to more changes if there are more good ideas that I can easily implement:

1. all new and more detailed illustrations (3d model) for the nuances of each movement
2. professional editing, layout, copyedits, etc. 
3. Content wise I'm going to revise recommendations and make more newbie friendly including:
4. separate beginner/intermediate/advanced type sections + programming options so newbies don't get thrown everything at once 
5. more detail on programming according to other activities/sports and for those who are busy and have very little workout time 
6. revisions/additions to the charts, and exercise technique including scapular positioning
7. more talk on specific mobility/flexibility details and programming that 
8. cleaning up misunderstandings such as skill work, making prilepin tables easier to use, etc
9. SOME legs options (although not true progressions) but it should give many people ideas of how they can train with the legs at home if they don't have access to a barbell.
10. my personal general strength recommendations for progressions to use
11. cheaper price (through cleaning up page count and eliminating specific injury info as it's clear that most people don't use it -- mobility/flexibility will still be there)

If you've read Starting Strength (1st and 2nd edition) it will hopefully be like that where the 2nd edition can stand along for at least half a decade before any revisions are made.

We just wrapped up Round 10!

With ten successful rounds under our (much) smaller belts, we’re excited to start Round 11 and we’re hoping others will join in.

**What 90days is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, ask questions, or read through other people’s updates. There's a weekly check-in thread every Monday and several themed posts (Runners, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1i0967/mod_official_introduction_thread_for_round_11/). Round 11 will officially begin on Monday, July 15th. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using a display name based on your age, gender, height, and weight (we'll describe how to decipher it all later).

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we're not going to force anyone to go sprinting.  Sprints are what we do to make it easier to stick to the whole 90 days!  We've split the 90 days into 3 sprints, each one 30 days long plus a 5 day rest period in between.  Why did we do this?  Well, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint!

**What's the schedule?**

Sprint 1: July 15 - August 13

Recovery: August 14 - August 18

Sprint 2: August 19 - September 17

Recovery: September 18 - September 22

Sprint 3: September 23 - October 22

TLDR; If you’re interested, subscribe to /r/90daysgoal. Day 1 is July 15th. There will be informational posts throughout the first couple weeks to get everyone started toward their goals. We'll have a progress/recovery week at the end of each month. The final day will be October 22nd.

The original post is here: http://redd.it/1e8rbe - and just requires *only 5 minutes a day* of handstand practice.

When I made the [original post](http://redd.it/1e8rbe), a few people asked if there would be an update on the progress people made with the challenge.

I have kept in touch with a lot of people who signed up for the challenge and have some of their results for you below. *Thousands* of people signed up and I still get signups every day, so this obviously isn't a survey of **everyone** who took the challenge.

I hope it gives motivation to people who couldn't see it through or still have handstands on their goals list, but haven't started training.

Hopefully people who put the challenge off, fell off the wagon, or never started can find this motivating enough to take the challenge and build the habit.  

The challenge just requires 5 minutes a day of handstand practice, so there's no reason to put it off.  Everyone has 5 minutes somewhere in there day to train the handstand!

2012 has been an awesome year for /r/BodyweightFitness. We've gone from just over 6000 unique pageviews per day in January to a whopping 60000 in November! All year people have been seriously contributing to the subreddit, providing awesome content that has allowed /r/BodyweightFitness to grow so much in so little time. The moderators would like to thank you all for being such awesome subscribers.

Now, we would like to reward you all as well, but unfortunately we do not possess the resources. However, we are able to award **5 times [Reddit Gold](http://www.reddit.com/gold/about)**.  
That's why we will hold a contest, in which you, the subscribers, nominate and vote on the best posts/comments or users of 2012. In case a post is nominated and wins it's category, the user that has made that post will get the prize. The five categories are as follows:  

* **Best Overall Post**: the most awesome post on /r/BodyweightFitness in 2012
* **Best Personal Video**: who posted the best video they had made themselves? This can be a form check, an exercise demonstration, whatever. The video has to be personal. Posting the 'best of calisthenics 2012'-video we see every day doesn't count.
* **Most Creative Equipment Use**: Who made the best use of equipment? Again, personal entries only. They don't have to be videos, pictures or text is fine too.
* **Best Form**: interpret this how you will: ""best"" form, or actual best form.
* **Wildcard**: this can be anything. You simply nominate a post or a user and state your reason why. For instance, this can be ""I nominate *161803398874989* for *being the biggest douchebag of 2012*"", but also ""I nominate *Phrakture* for *performing the best backflip of 2012*"".

Nominating will go as follows: reply to this thread (use the comment box at the top), stating:  
I nominate *username* for *category*, or I nominate *post* for *category*. Any and all contributions made during 2012 are allowed.  
In case you're nominating a post or comment, please provide a link to the actual post or comment itself. Also **PLEASE CHECK THE THREAD BEFORE POSTING A NOMINATION**. We will remove any duplicates.

Voting will go like this: If you think a nomination should win the category, simply upvote the post! We've enabled 'contest mode' on this thread, which means you can't see how your nomination is doing. Don't worry about that, the votes are still counted fairly.

The contest will end at the start of 2013, which is 1 January, 0:00 GMT. This is december 31st 7:00 pm in EST, december 31st 4:00 pm in PST and january 1st 11:00 am in whatever Sydney's timezone is called. If my calculations are correct, that is.  

In case you want to ask a question, drop me a PM or sent a message to the moderators. We will remove any replies to the top-level that aren't a nomination. If you have something to say about a nomination, please reply to the particular nomination.

Let the voting begin!

However a lot of the progressions I'm reading imply that the person can do 1 jumping pullup etc. I can't do that yet. 

Background: I've been working out seriously for about 5 years, I mostly run, but also like to do weights. I would say I gain muscle and strength easily. 

I'm a medium/stronger female, I can lift about 50 pounds with my arms with ease in work, using my core to support it, do 20-30 half pushups with difficulty, and can squat close to bodyweight. I can easily do mountain climbing stuff, but find I use my core a lot. I can lift the squat bar over my head, but it is very difficult to hold.  Lsits can't be done yet for extended periods.  I have a lot of trouble with proper form for pushups because my chest, by virtue of being female, will hit the ground a solid 5 inches before the rest of me. I can do a handstand if I start against a wall first. And no, I'm not that busty and I do wear a supportive bra. Is that OK form for a woman? Are there any ways to get better form? 

What would be a good progression for someone with much less upper body strength than the ones I'm seeing show?

I began in late February as a beginner with some general fitness. Now 13 weeks later I can see a big improvement and I have reached quite of few of my goals.

Here was my first strength workout:

* 3x4 negative pullups

* 3x4 dips

* 3x7 rows

* 3x8 pushups

* 3x12 squats


And, here was my last workout to end week 13:

* 3 x 7 PPPU (hands near belly button)

* 3 x 7/7/8 rows (one foot at height of bar, the other tucked in)

* 3 x 1 HeSPU + 5 neg 

* 3 x 7/7/8 pullups + 3 negatives

* 3 x 5 pistol squats

My progress on pullups, going from none to 3 sets of 7/7/8, is what I am most excited about. I've also gone from not being able to lift myself in a tuck L-sit to almost being able to hold an L-sit for 5 to 10 seconds (my legs are still not completely straight). My main goals now are to get to 3 x 5 of HeSPU and to be able to do 3 sets of tuck front lever rows. Soon, I hope to buy some rings.

I started off doing SS 8 months ago when I was around 190 but I never took progress pics of those, I built up to a 325 squat and a 315 DL before I decided to switch to calisthenics, the movement and incredible strength really allured me. I mainly followed Coach Sommer's book GymnasticBodies and extensive research within the forums along with a little help from /r/bodyweightfitness and implemented squat / DL training once a week. I worked out 5x a week while also doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 3x a week. 

Some feats include:

4s support hold rings turned in ---&gt; 30s support hold RTO

5s lsit tuck --&gt; 45s L-sit on parallettes


3x4 chinups ---&gt; 3x7 30lb chinups

10 second wall hs ---&gt; avg 16s freestanding hs

Full hamstring compression, can do full 3x8 Hanging v-ups on my stall-bar

elbow lever and working on 1 armed elbow lever hand assisted
I do a lot of band stretching for shoulder health along with scapular mobilization with bands all provided by Ido Portal.

I have been dealing with a left shoulder problem for the last 4 months so my progress isn't as high as it should be. This is because I can't externally rotate my arm due to fluid in my bicep tendon, this coupled with the nerve impingement I acquired 2 months ago causing me to get shooting pains in awkward elbow positions and I can't even use a pronated grip, this has really staggered my progress. Also was a 1/2 inch away from full splits 4 days ago and got excited deciding to push too hard and stretched out a hamstring muscle in my abductor, my physiotherapist said it'll be 4-8 weeks until it's back to normal, doing a series of exercises to lengthen the process. I break easily. 

My diet consisted of 

WO Days: 3400 calories / 500g carbs / 50g of fat 

Rest days: 2300 / 70g of carbs / 130g of fat 

My eating phase was 2-10 and was pretty strict about the foods I ate, mainly eating lots of chicken and rice and stir-fries along with some leangains meals I have snatched from various websites.

Of course this is just an idea, but it can really make a difference in how easy it is to make a routine. For example, in the [""How to Construct Your Own Routine""](http://www.eatmoveimprove.com/2010/03/the-fundamentals-of-bodyweight-strength-training/) article it mentions - Do one vertical push upwards...etc. After someone learns how to make a routine, they can look at this chart/image thing and they can easily find and choose which exercises they want to progress with. 

Lack of equipment isn't a good reason to not get started working out when we have variations on techniques, like ring pushups &gt; regular pushup progressions. We don't exactly have to post/link progressions for each exercises, but that would make it even more helpful.

If this has already been made, then tell me please! It could be a great addition to the sidebar. We do have [this](http://www.drillsandskills.com/article/18), but we can definitely do better than that and label exercises for push/pull while having it all condensed into a single image type of thing. We can even add recommended stretching/flexibility techniques along with prehabilitation exercises to work with. After the routine construction article we can sway the trainee towards something like this, making it easier to make a routine and get started right away.

Thoughts?

Thought I'd share for other people having issues.,IIIZhouYu,68,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qlo8n/finally_realised_how_you_balance_a_handstand/,"For a lot of people this will be unneccessary, but I thought I'd share as I've really struggled to properly balance my handstand and I reckon I might be able to help others in the same position.

Basically I've been doing wall handstands for ages, but I've either been flopping against the wall or flopping back to the floor. If this sounds like you, then hopefully this post might help.

What's helped me today is realising just how important the hands are to the handstand (I know, derp++). Just like you'd balance on the balls of your feet, balancing weight between the toes and the ball, that's exactly how you should do it in a handstand.

The key thing is that the balance should be focussed on the underside of the finger knuckles, before they branch into the fingers - [red stuff here](http://imgur.com/6pnjp). 

A nice way to find that point is to stand up facing a wall, put your palms out towards it, rest the fingertips against it first and then peel downwards towards the heel of your hand. Then flex your hand by first pushing fingertips into the wall, then the finger knuckles, then the heel. This is an exaggerated way to show what you feel happening when balancing in a handstand.

Then, kick into a wall handstand, and before you push your feet away from the wall, try that flexing motion. You should hopefully feel the differentiation of the areas in the hands, even though your balance won't move much since you are propped up against the wall. So, push away with your feet slightly and try to feel how the balance shifts when pushing through different parts of the hand. 

If it works then you should be able to start balancing freely for longer periods. Your hands should also feel pretty hard worked.

I hope this helps someone who's been in the same position as I have.",,False,,t5_2tf0a,False,,,True,t3_qlo8n,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qlo8n/finally_realised_how_you_balance_a_handstand/,

My understanding now is that chin ups activate the lats almost as much as pull ups but chin ups feel easier because they engage more of the bicep.  Is this true?  I can't find a source.

If it is true, why does almost all of the documentation (FAQ, beginner work out, etc.) reference pull ups?  Personally, I just like the way doing a chin up feels compared to a pull up.

Finally, I understand that one should train the exercise that is closer to their goal (pull ups for rock climbing for example).  However, if the goal isn't tied directly to the pulling exercise (goal of dipping 1.5x body weight for example) and the pulling exercise is there just to balance out the pushing, is there a reason to pick pull ups over chin ups?

Yesterday I did some exercises like 3x15 squats 3x15 push-ups and 3x15 sit-ups (when upright I twist my upper body from left to right, it's something I remembered from when I did martial arts when I was young) plus some exercises related to my knee injury. But after thinking it through I thought that I could be possible that I am doing more harm than good by just doing some exercises so I started checking reddit. 

I prefer bodyweight exercises over weight exercises so I came over here after checking /r/fitness and after reading the FAQ here I'm still completely lost on what to do.

Here is my information

* Age: 21
* Sex: Male
* Height: 185-187 cm
* Weight: 67 kilogram

Goal: Weight gain to at least 75 kilo and overall increase in endurance and strength and maintaining that.

I used to do some exercises when I did some martial arts (Kenpō/kempo) but that was around the time I was 10-12 years old.

I also have a knee injury where I fell on top of knee causing a small tear in the meniscus. Another problem is that because at the hospital they didn't bother to have thorough examination they just put my leg in a cast causing quite a big deterioration in my knee sinews.

So could you guys help me out with finding out what to do?

EDIT: What should I do about cardio?

I found eshlow's OG progression spreadsheet somewhere, but I'm afraid I have quite a bit of trouble understanding exactly what to do. Perhaps the book would make it much more clear. 

Plus, I'm kinda weak. I can hold a bar-hang, both hands, for 4x 1min. Standard pullups, about 10RM, maybe only 5 or 6 if wide-grip. Strict pushups, about 16-18RM. Managed a shaky ring support for about 45sec. Core and flexibility are somewhat stronger points, I can L-sit for probably 30sec. Probably would be longer but arms weaken and make me lose balance. 

Based on these figures, what should I focus on with the rings? Thanks for any help you can offer. 

EDIT: link I used. My cost was a bit more than his because I bought ratcheting straps to make it easier to exactly match the height of the two rings.

And it should for you. Let me 

I started out at 15 as a fat kid. Developed depression, my eating habits went to complete shit, became lazy, and my body definitely showed the results. I'm now 18, 40 pounds of fat lighter and sporting peccs (PECCS!) this is a huge accomplishment for me. 

So I'm not here to barrage about getting into shape.. You totally should, by the way.. I'm here to talk about finding a routine. You see, I have no method to getting into shape. I just ran my my ass off and did a lot of pushups. And it worked. I'll upload pics later if anyone cares. But as a user to this sub pointed out to me, you can't randomly do exercises forever. It's great to get the ball rolling, but if you want to stay in shape, you've got to find a routine and stick with it. Otherwise, you'll just get your happy ass right back out of shape again. 

So tonight, I'm starting the routine in the FAQ. Win or lose, I'm doing it. TONIGHT. I will update in six weeks.. A huge thank you for all the helpful tips and motivation you have provided this kid.

I took some advice and stretched the hell out of my calves and ankles with the asian squat stretch. You basically just get in to a low squat position with your legs spread about shoulder width apart, and move your hips around. If you shift your weight forward and on to one ankle you get a real fantastic stretch in your achilles tendon. It makes a huge difference for the pistol because you have to really dorsiflex your ankle in the bottom position, and if your calves are tight it will antagonize that dorsiflexion and you'll be more likely to fall backwards. Stretch those calves and it's much easier to stay balanced down low. And don't forget to flex your abs, too.

Goals: Mainly hypertrophy at the moment as I'm seeing strength gains

I started out a few years ago and I could maybe do 2 pullups. I'm now at around 15 max pullups. So, I've seen strength gains. I can also do pistol squats now, I'm starting to progress in my planche progressions, I can do one-arm pushups, etc. But, I've seen little or no hypertrophy.

I've used TDEE calcultors, and I've tried eating up to 1000 calories over that. I can't possibly eat more without feeling really uncomfortable all day. I've read about 400 cal over is ideal, but I don't gain weight then. Right now I'm eating 3500 cal daily and getting &gt;130g protein daily. Also, when I gain weight, it's usually fat. I feel bloated and, well, fat.

I recently changed my routine to 4 sets instead of three. I'm hoping this helps, but I'd still like to do more.

My routine is (3 days/week)(reps are until failure):

Pullups (40lbs weighted) (4x7)

Pushups--different variations (40lbs weighted) (4x8)

Dips (40lbs weighted) (4x8)

Inverted Rows (40lbs weighted) (4x10) -- rows don't seem like a challenge at all, what can I exchange this for

My off days are 5min handstand progression/planche progression, 5min L-sit progressions, Pistols 3x5, Hanging Leg raises 3x6.

I'm doing 2.5mins rest between sets for every exercise.

How can I make my routine longer or more effective? Could I start doing 8 sets of pullups, even though I read this is ineffective. My routine is only 35min at the moment. Or what is your advice so I can achieve hypertrophy? I'd like to get stronger (which I am doing), but I'd also like to not look incredibly skinny. I'd also like to stick with bodyweight training.

I just started my summer running and already run 5km in the park. I'm not in such bad shape actually, it's just that i'm packing around 10 kilos of excess body weight (i'm 80kg and should be 70kg), and to be honest, i think without those 10 kilos i would probably be able to do a pull-up or two.

However, while i'm focusing on running and losing the excess weight, i would also like to work on the basics, like pull-ups and stomach and all that.


Thanks a lot for your time and help in advance, I appreciate it,
Pyopi


**----EDIT:----**

Wow thanks for all the great advice guys! I guess negatives are what i'm going for. Hope i don't get laughed at at the park haha :-)

1361862424.0,57,self.bodyweightfitness,198xdk,I just finished 3 months of online training with Ido Portal AMA.,Skiingjoo,63,6,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/198xdk/i_just_finished_3_months_of_online_training_with/,"I see a lot of people asking about what its like/is it worth it to train with Ido online. So here is my writeup. 

**My history:** I have been doing CrossFit for over 7 years now. Any of my gymnastic experience was from Crossfit (so not a ton). I met Ido while I was running a CF gym in Israel. I got a chance to train with him one-one-one and was impressed by his knowledge and desire to teach. 
My abilities beforehand. I could do a decent tuck planche, strict muscle up, chest to bar pull-ups, a crummy press to handstand, handstand pushups (Freestanding). I thought Iwas in good shape, but by Ido's standards I was ""Shit"".

**is it worth it:** If you have the money, the time, and work ethic, then yes! You will get three months of programing for $1,090. You will be expected to train for 3-4 hours a day up to 6 days a week. If you can't commit to this, its really not worth your time. Expect to work HARD. 
If you are looking to be treated with kid gloves, go somewhere else. Ido will deal with exactly 0% of your bullshit. The guy is busy, and in demand. If your unsure about it do your research ahead of time. Read his blog, Facebook and check out his Youtube. 

**What you get for your money**: You will have to first send in a video of yourself doing some movements from a list Ido sends you along with your goals. Expect to be criticized, but don't take it personally. 
You will then get sent six weeks of programing. You are then required to make another video of you performing all the movements. Expect to do things wrong and resubmit. Once you are given the all clear you will get started. 
Once five weeks rolls around you will make another video of your progress and submit it. Expect good feedback and tips mixed with the usual ""I know women stronger than you"". 

**My Results** My flexibility has greatly improved, my strength has also improved in leaps and bounds. 
I can now:
* Hold a fully extended handstand.
* Solid Press to handstand.
* Fully extended front and back lever.
* Multiple Freestanding handstand pushups. 
* On my way to a one-hand handstand.
* 10 Sec Straddle L sit from the floor.
* New handstand hold is 33 seconds. 
* One arm Chin-up is now well within my reach.

My girlfriend (whom I don't live with) has recently become interested in getting into shape and she's not interested in joining a gym, so I've tried to get her into the rank beginner routine from the FAQ.

When she's here with me to talk her through everything she's fine with it, but when she's at home she finds it confusing and the most I've encouraged her to do is Molding Mobility most days.

Meanwhile, Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred has been doing the rounds lately and she's heard from her friends how great it is. She's been doing it more consistently than Molding Mobility with no encouragement, so I'm happy because she's a complete noob so she'll see progress and hopefully set a foundation for a better lifestyle.

Watching the first video it seems to be mostly cardio/endurance but I have some concern that the programme is very crunch centric, and leans more towards pushing than pulling.

**TL;DR:** 100% fitness noob girlfriend is doing 30 Day Shred, which seems to have lots of crunches and not much pulling.

Given that it looks like she's going to stick to it:

1. is it good idea to replace the crunches with static holds?

Thank you for the great work of composing the FAQ and the beginner routine. I've moved over from SS (A basic barbell program, lots of squats and deadlifts) to doing the basic routine promoted in the FAQ.

After a few weeks of training, I've found myself enjoying intermittent  sets throughout a day, rather than one long workout.

It keeps workouts fun, I find myself not having to summon motivation to workout, instead ""I'm done studying, lets do a few sets of strength training to clear my thoughts and recoup.""  I'm sure it's better to do the exercises all at once.  However, doing something is better than nothing or missing days.  

So ultimately, I'm asking, how much am I losing by doing sets intermittently, over the course of many hours, instead of all at once?  Does anyone else have this habit?  Would it be best to do all the sets of one exercise in the same mini session?

It was such a great success.

I turned it into a free [4-week course on getting your first handstand](http://eepurl.com/zmnT5).  As of this writing, over 500 people signed up for the course.

The course was #1 on /r/bodyweightfitness and /r/fitness for several days.

I want to take all of the data and performance interviews from the past month and make the course even better.

Right now, there's no telling how long that will take me though, or if the next version will be free.  It will definitely be improved.

The email lessons will no longer go to new subscribers after tomorrow.  Anyone who signs up within the next 4 hours will still get the lessons, but I have to take it down after that.

Anyone who signs up after that won't get the lessons but will get an alert when the new course is ready.

I've never been able to stick with any program more than 6 weeks. Motivation isn't the issue; I love exercise/being outside/pushing myself/blah blah. I just always feel like I'm doing everything wrong. 

Wrong routines, wrong form, wrong periodization, wrong whatever. I genuinely don't know how anyone ever succeeds at improving themselves because it feels like there are a thousand variables that you have to have perfect or you just don't get any results whatsoever. Plus maybe I'll just find out I've got some weird condition or lasting injury and just mess myself up more.

I see all these awesome posts from people who are banging out flagpoles and planche pushups and clapping handstand pushups and have genuinely no idea (despite reading way more training literature than neccessary) how you get to that. 

I do work out regularly and love it while I do it but I feel like I'm never going to be able to do any of this right and be stuck as a hundred forty pound weak shit the rest of my life. 

Anyone who has dealt with something similar have any idea how to figure all this out? Thank you for bearing with me.

tl;dr: Everyone is doing something right and I don't know what it is

Right now I can do about 15 push-ups at once. I lived under the impression that you're lifting about 70% of your weight when performing a push-up, which would mean about 35 kg in my case (77 lbs). When it comes to dumbbell bench press, I'm currently doing 3 sets of 10 reps with 7 kg (15 lb) dumbbells. Which means I'm lifting 14 kg (30 lbs) in total. That's nowhere near what I'm supposed to be lifting when I'm doing push-ups. Granted, if I didn't do as many sets I might be able to lift more, but definitely not 35 kg (2 x 17 kg dumbbells).

So looking for any recommended pull up stations? Have seen the ""hotgym"" which is collapsible so good in terms of space but is a lot of money and wonder how stable it will be.

I've been trying to get myself motivated and get fit for a while now but with no success. After searching the net for different types of fitness training I found Calisthenics, mainly through the Bar-Barians on youtube. The things they could do and the way they looked, added to the fun they seemed to be having as a group, really sold me on the idea. Then I found you guys and started trying to gather information about it with the view to getting big and looking great, however, I kept getting confused by conflicting posts.

I kept seeing the Convict Conditioning title thrown around and ended up buying it. My copy turned up today and it's really changed my mind. I no longer want to be big and base my workouts on looks. As nice as it would be to look great, I want to be as strong as I can be. I have a lot of friends that pound the gym day in and day out to increase their bench or squat max, and I'd love to turn around and bust out a set of handstand push ups and see the look on their faces.

Sorry for the long post but my main point is that this book has finally given me the motivation I need to change my ways, and change my life. I hope to be pretty active on this subreddit and gain all the knowledge I can.

1372781704.0,50,self.bodyweightfitness,1hi5vu,Hanging with relaxed shoulders at the bottom of pullups,eshlow,55,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1hi5vu/hanging_with_relaxed_shoulders_at_the_bottom_of/,"OK, this kind of came up in the bodyweight thread in weight room, but let's analyze the ""conundrum"" of relaxing your shoulders at the end range of pullups.

There's generally two key points that I want to make.

* Hanging at the bottom of pullups where the GH joint is approximately in end range flexion can aggravate some people's shoulders, especially those with previous injury history or poor mobility to go overhead. Basically, you can tell if this is you if your shoulders are uncomfortable/painful at the bottom, and it can vary depending on injury condition such as tendonitis, impingement, bursitis, or others. So it is not for everyone.. if you've had previous injuries in your shoulders and relaxing at the bottom is bothersome I would suggest not doing it.

* However, there's nothing really magical about doing it if you can do it. You do get a bit of extra range of motion and scapular muscle activation (due to having to retense the scapular muscles and bring them into a more optimal position) but there's no inherent thing about extra connective tissue strengthening. It doesn't really strengthen the connective tissue anymore than other movement.

Basically, when you're hanging the muscles are going to stretch until they get to a certain length where the muscle spindles kick in with involuntary muscle activity to avoid the joint from dislocating (GH joint specifically), but the scapular muscles will also do this. It's neither bad or good to allow this. It's just some extra range of motion.

Note that the muscle spindles involuntary kick in for other movements where the humerus is being pulled away from the GH joint such as deadlifts. So there's nothing really inherently bad about that; it's just the body's way of preventing a possible injury condition just like the muscles getting tight when you stretch them towards any other end range of motion. 

There's some slight benefits in getting the scapular muscles through a bit more range of motion, but often times this is out weighed by previous injury history or other aggravation to the shoulders at end range. If you can do it and want to do it go for it. If you can't do it and want to do it, then it can be built up to as long as you rehab properly. If you don't want to do it then I wouldn't really worry about it too much.

1372537411.0,50,self.bodyweightfitness,1hbsns,New prerequisite for Muscle Ups: False Grip Hang!,Antranik,60,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1hbsns/new_prerequisite_for_muscle_ups_false_grip_hang/,"So the other day I was working out with another friend and he was very strong and light.  We were following the pulling-portion of [my bodyweight routine](http://antranik.org/bodyweight-training/) and I asked him if he wanted to try to get comfortable with a muscle up.  He was totally down to try it.

Now, in my guide, it is recommended that before you do *any* MU training, you must be able to complete...

* 3x8 full, deep dips
* 3x8 chest-to-bar pull ups.

I know that my buddy was totally capable of these things, so I thought we would simply try some false grip pull ups on the rings as that's where I'm at.

Turns out, he had no experience with the false grip at all and doing pull ups with them turned out to be extremely challenging because he wasn't comfortable with the false grip itself.

**So in my guide, I added the ""False Grip Hang"" (3x30sec) as the first progression for MU training.  After one is comfortable with simply hanging with a false grip like that, *then* they could start practicing pull ups with the false grip.**

**[Here is an excellent false-grip-hang video demonstration by gymnasticswod.com](http://gymnasticswod.com/content/false-grip-progressions-pt1).**

A good foundation is so, so, very important. Also, chalking up the wrists helps a lot. Anyway, I hope that helps.  

**ETA: Also added Russian Dips as another exercise that leads up to as something that should be mastered before trying an eccentric or kipping muscle up.  This is hella important as it gets you used to working out the most difficult part of the MU: the transition.  [Here's a good tutorial video on how to perform them them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtXMZgQOOpE).

Core Strength is a very hot and sexy term and as well the biggest loaf of shit out there.

I get daily remarks at locations I train at around the world: 'man, you have amazing core strength', 'what a demonstration of core control' and other shenanigans. I usually say 'thanks' and roll my eyes walking away.

Here is your wake up call:

1. Rarely wo
uld Core Strength be the limiting factor in performance. It can happen, but its not a common issue.

2. Often proper muscular coordination is in the heart of the problem, and not lack of strength. For example most people have enough 'core strength' to properly hold a handstand, but lack the proper 'software' to coordinate rebalancing action and use it along with other areas in the proper timing. Its not weakness or decondition that holds them back, so stop wasting their time, 'Handstand Experts'.

3. Core Strength, even when needed, have to be developed specifically to the relevant movement patterns. You can hammer away on the Pilates machines but I will break you apart with some simple gymnastics stuff, a bit of BJJ, strongman carries or even a back squat. I actually do this, on a regular basis in my workshops where I receive a lot of top level Yogis, Pilates folks and other 'core specialists'.

4. Most professional athletes train their core with various drills, thats true. They are successful IN SPITE of this habit and not because of it. I can speak for myself and my students: we are performing one arm handstands, airborn acrobatics, we climb, we fight, we dance, we can perform full front levers, human flags, press handstands from an L position, etc. WE ARE NOT DOING ONE GENERAL CORE EXERCISE. Not even one.

5. The contribution of 'core exercises' to the appearance of your six pack is minimal. Those muscles have poor potential for hypertrophy in most people and usually are covered with a layer of fat. So, first things first, put your efforts into becoming less of a fatbastard before you allow yourself ANY core exercises.
Now if anything can hypertrophy the abs and shock them into growth its going to be very different from their postural supporting design. The best I've come across are... BACK TUCKS. Yes, you heard me right- back flips.
I remember a case where one of my students took on a challenge and decided to perform 120 back flips for time - as quickly as possible. We like doing shit like that from time to time. She finished in under 30 min, (yes, SHE) but did not appear at the facility for the next week.. Later we discovered she couldn't walk due to extreme soreness of the abdominal wall that lasted for days.

So, enjoy your swiss ball, pilates reformer, crunches, sit-ups, garuda, gyrotonics, 6 min abs solution, kb ab circuit, russian twists and other past-times, but please, dont have any delusions of adequacy: this is NOT going to give you GENERAL CORE STRENGTH applicable to any movement demands.

Like when it says that circuit workouts aren't effective, really, and then it promptly links to SimpleFit, as first link. That's a bit weird. It also really isn't that clear how to select exercises (I added a bit, but it's kind of tacked on).

I'm only just now thinking about completely restructuring the FAQ. What if we start with a more goal-oriented approach to creating your own routine (much like a tl;dr for the EMI article). Introduce the charts there.  
I'm not sure we need the why of BWF, just that it's as effective as lifting weights for certain goals, blah blah blah.

I'd like to clarify exactly what an intermediate is, and explain why doing an intermediate routine while you're not actually intermediate is a bad thing.

**An intermediate is someone who can't progress linearly.**

Linear progress is when you progress from (more or less) workout to workout. If you stay at the same reps of the same exercises at the same weight for a full week, it may be a good idea to look into recovery factors. If sleep and diet are in check, then you are an intermediate, and your programming has to become more complex in order for you to progress.  
This is a bad thing, because **if you can progress properly on a beginner routine, doing an intermediate routine will slow you down**. Think about it: with intermediate routines you're only really progressing on a movement like once a week, whereas with a beginner routine, you're progressing two or three times a week. That's a huge difference!

So, please, don't hop onto an intermediate routine if you're not an intermediate. You're only selling yourself short.",,False,,t5_2tf0a,1374278378.0,,,True,t3_1inugz,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1inugz/psa_intermediate_routines_are_for_intermediates/,

Am I doing it right?",bulkornot,59,11,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1erq8i/suffering_from_analysis_paralysis_these_are_my/,"So I've read the FAQ, the essential posts, and Steve Low's Fundamentals of Bodyweight Training and I feel quite overwhelmed. There's quite a lot to take in but I think I got the gist of it.

I've been working out more or less since September 2012. Started with Insanity (finished the entire program) before moving on to Convict Conditioning sometime in Jan (and yes I did read [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ualu6/convict_conditioning_changed_my_views/c4trv8z) before starting on CC). I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/17df1z/should_i_stop_bulking_i_think_im_gaining_fat_more/) my back story in r/fitness a couple of months ago.

Anyway, I've stopped working out since end of March due illness and moving overseas. I've always intended to continue working out and now that I'm more settled down, I intend to follow a more proper bodyweight regime. CC does have some benefits, but I find it a bit lacking, and boring. Anyway below are my goals and routine.  

**Stats:**

* Male
* 24yo
* 5'9"" (175cm)
* 165lbs (75kg)
* Waist is around 32 inches  

**Main goals I'm working towards:**

* Do 1x5 reps of handstand press
* 15 secs hold free handstand
* Do 1x5 reps of muscle up
* Do 15 secs hold L-sit
* Cut down to 70kg from 75kg while maintaining or gaining a bit of hypertrophy.
* Create a fundamental base strength for bodyweight movements.  

**Routine**

*Skill work*

* Wall handstands
* Foot supported L-sit
* Parallel bar support

*Strength work*

* 3x8 reps pushups
* 3x8 reps parallel bar dips
* 3x8 reps pike handstand pushups
* 3x8 reps rows
* 3x8 reps pull ups
* 3x8 reps bodyweight squats  

**A couple of questions:**

* For parallel bar support, is it just an isometric hold where I just hold as long as I can while depressing my shoulder blades?
* I want to work towards both handstand press and muscle up. But that means I have to include two vertical pushing exercises (dips and handstand pushups). Will this cause an imbalance?
* As I'm just starting out, do I put both my wall handstands and supported L-sit under strength work? Does it means I have to remove some movements from my routine?
* How long do I have to hold my handstands and L-sits?
* I'm still confused about the difference between strength and skill work. What I get is that skill work depends mostly on balance the more you practice a particular movement.
* I don't have rings at the moment. Can I still do a tuck front/back lever on a pull up bar or monkey bars?
* I'm planning to eat 500 calories below maintenance on recovery days and eat at maintenance or slightly above on workout days. Will this still impede my gains in strength since I'm trying to cut?  

Yeah I know I can be very anal over details at times. But I'm heading out to the park tomorrow morning to just do the routine I've set out. Would love to have some feedback on my routine!

My story and routine are inside.",SQUID_FUCKER,53,11,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1ifwxp/ive_read_the_faq_and_have_been_lurkingworking_out/,"So long story short, I had surgery in October and because of that and how I was feeling doing SS eating too much and not doing any running or cardio, I decided to change my entire routine and mindset about fitness and *my* personal goals.  I decided I didn't want to be the guy who could squat 450 and dl 600 lbs.  I wanted to be able to do a muscle up, run a 5k in under 20 minutes, get better at rock climbing, swimming, biking, ect.

I know those two goals are not mutually exclusive to a lot of people but I wanted a better sense of balance and bodyweight control that I never got with heavy lifting in the gym and honestly, I was getting very bored with SS.  I haven't lifted since I played football in high school and I was moving the weights just fine but it wasn't doing anything for me.

I looked into Crossfit a bit with a friend of mine and although I couldn't afford it at the time, I got some good ideas about training I might start incorporating (I do miss deadlifts and box jumps are fantastic).  Anyway, sorry for the story, I was hoping to get some critique on my routine:  
  
I do the following **5 times**, the number of reps isn't arbitrary, it's about 70% of my max.  **3 Minutes rest between sets**, doing the **sets as fast as possible**.  Right now, I'm averaging around 6 minutes to complete:  

**10 Pull-Ups**(Switching up width and grip on each set)  
  
**30 Push-Ups**(First set is regular, then wide grip, then diamond, ect.)  

**25 Seated Dips**(Slow and controlled)  

**5 Front Dips**(oddly, the front dip is the one I struggle the most with)  

**20 Inverted Rows**  

Then to catch my breath for a sec before legs, I'll do **2 minutes of planks**.  Switching to a side plank for the last 45 seconds.  On alternating sets I'll do **Russian twists**.      

**15 Goblet Squats** with a 45lb dumbbell I have  
  

**15 Bulgarian Split Squats (each leg)**  
  
Like I said, I'll do this superset 5 times.  I'm usually soaked in sweat by my 3rd set and by the 5th one, almost all of my numbers are down 20%.   I should also mention that I do this routine MWF and on TR I will run a 5k, right now my time is right around the 21 minute mark but my neighborhood is a giant hill so I suspect it would be sub 20 min on flat ground.  I will take the weekends to rest.  
  
So that's about what I do fitness wise, aside from my hobbies of climbing and playing sports.  Does this program looked balanced?  I was thinking as a progression I might invest in a weight jacket.  I have absolutely been seeing gains too, which has been great.  I'm more than open to any suggestions, or alternative workouts though.  Thanks!

today is the start of my ""calisthenics experiment"".

A little bit of backstory:
In 2009 I first saw a video of Hannibal and the other New York people on youtube. After watching a few videos I decided that that's what I want to do!
So I started right away, with zero knowledge in training and nutrition. I had no idea what I was doing and just went to the park, did some push ups, pull ups, tried some handstands and left. I did this for maybe 1 year and you can guess what my results looked like. But I kept going and found /r/fitness in the beginning of 2011. I read there everyday and got some basic knowledge of training and nutrition. Then I started going to the gym in August 2011 and been there since. 

Now more than 1.5 years later, after many successes and failures in the gym I decided to go back to my ""roots"" in calisthenics. Today I did my first workout cosisting of: 5 minute l-sit practice, 5 sets of chin ups, 5 sets of dips, 5 minutes of tucked front lever attempts, 5 sets of diamond push ups and 5 sets of squats.  
It felt great and I want to continue this and someday when the summer is over again I want to mix it up with weightlifting again. Because I love both. 

I want to see how far I can take it with calisthenics this time, with more understanding about everything and a good routine. I look forward to a great time and lots of good workouts. :)

Thanks for reading this and excuse me for my english, i'm german and i'm giving my best here. :D

And also thanks for the nice routine in the FAQ! I really needed this!

That gives me a little leverage and allows me to easily adjust how intense my rows become.

I can do nowhere near 5 minutes of handstand practice, I can hold position for about 30 seconds or so and repeat several times. I can do the 1-2 minutes of L-sit with legs touching the floor for leverage, as I get better at that legs become less of the equation but they're needed for balance!

So i've started RTO push ups and i'm unsure of the correct form. I've looked at the video in the cheat sheet (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYvZXmxBRRY cheat sheet states 'first 11 seconds') but that isn't a correct RTO push up from my understanding? On the vid his rings are only turned out at the top support position for about half a second and then in the bottom position the rings aren't even paralell, he turns them in.

I'm particularly interested in hand/arm positioning during the movement because when i'm doing them it seems i have to lean forward and almost end up in a kind of RTO Pseudo Planche Push up with the daunting threat of face planting and smashing my teeth to bits. 

If anyone has such a video or could make one it would be greatly appreciated. 

Obviously if the video is correct then great, i can move on from RTO push-ups, but i suspect the form shown is doo-doo.

Cheers

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes (check out [/r/btfc](http://www.reddit.com/r/btfc) for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a dailygoal thread where you can post your goals, ask questions, or read through other people’s updates. There's a weekly check-in every Monday and several themed posts (Runners, Fitocracy challenges, weekly workout challenges, diet/exercise/general discussion topics) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread](http://redd.it/1ajlw3). Round 10 will officially begin on Monday, March 25, 2013. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using anonymous display names.

I currently do Deadlifts and pistol squat progressions on an A-B rotation for leg work and I plan on adding sprints on days I do pistol squats as they're not really that taxing for me as I'm still attempting to get full ROM on them. Plus the weather is nice and I enjoy being outside and running. How should sets and rest look for strength work? I'll separate it into track sprints and hill sprints as I'll probably bounce back and forth depending on the day due to time, weather, etc. To clarify, I'm only doing one type of sprint work per day, not both.

Track sprints:  
I have access to a 1/4 mile track. Not sure what distance would be best for strength work. I'm guessing 100m? I figure for sets do the full 100m, rest 3-5 minutes between sets, with 3-4 sets to start out with and possibly add more sets as I progress.

Hill Sprints:  
I was thinking of dividing this into categories of short and long hills divided by time. The park not that far away has a variety of hills, some short, some steep, and some steep and long, and some long hills with gradual slopes. Figured I can separate them by the times and by slopes. Something like &lt;20s for short, &gt;20s for long. For short hills something like 4-6 sets with 3-5 minutes rest and for long hills 3-4 sets with 3-5 minutes rest?

1358165624.0,43,self.bodyweightfitness,16jq84,Results flattening out? Try a month of German Volume Training with bodyweight.,dansin,58,15,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/16jq84/results_flattening_out_try_a_month_of_german/,"German volume training (GVT) is a routine for non-beginner lifters to pack on some size in a short amount of time. But it's not intended for long term use. I realized recently it works extremely well for bodyweight training.

To summarize the routine you essentially try to do a 10x10 of the same exercise. In the beginning it starts of easy, but gets very difficult in the end. Keep a short, regular resting time between exercises (about 90 seconds). Since it's bodyweight, be extremely careful when you start getting tired, I highly recommend against handstand pushups with GVT.

I believe this routine is great for bodyweight because: 

1. It's the same exercise each time, so you don't have to change the setup. 
2. In bodyweight, it's often difficult to get hypertrophy, GVT is designed for hypertrophy.
3. It's simple to do with limited equipment since you don't need to increment the difficulty every set. 
4. It's an easy way to change up your routine every once in a while.

I've been at bodyweight for over a year now and after two weeks of GVT I'm still getting crazy sore which is a feeling I haven't gotten much of in bodyweight. This is the first time since rock climbing that I've gotten sore forearms.

My recommendations for GVT with bodyweight training:

1. Two bodyparts per day a few days per week (depending on time). 

2. Pick an exercise that you can normally do about 15-20 reps of. 

3. Use a timer (90s) between sets.  Track your sets (of course). 

4. Aim for 10x10 but realistically you wont be able to get 10 by the 
6th or 7th set. 

5. Stop at 10 reps, don't worry if the first few sets seem too easy, it'll catch up to you! 

6. DO NOT pick an exercise which failure could lead to injury (such as handstand pushups) as GVT is extremely tiring. 

7. Only do it for a few weeks at a time, then go back to your old routine (since it's designed for hypertrophy over strength).

In summary, for non-beginners of bodyweight training, do a few weeks of GVT every once in a while to add some major hypertrophy and some variety into your workout. Don't be surprised if you're the sorest you've ever gotten with BW workouts.

Also I'd love to hear what other people think about GVT with BW fitness.",,False,,t5_2tf0a,False,,,True,t3_16jq84,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/16jq84/results_flattening_out_try_a_month_of_german/,

One thing: Although my sets are going up, I still only manage about 25 pushups before failure, something I was able to do before. Each set seems easier, but the reps aren't going up. Am I doing anything wrong?

When I started off, I decided to leave out rows from my workout, thinking they weren't that important. 

I soon realized their importance, though, and started looking for a way to do those.

**So, here's what you do**. 

1. Take a chair, or a ladder, and place it in front of your pull up bar (Mine's around 1m or ~3.33ft high, I use the top part of my chair).

2. Hang from the pull up bar (Mine's around 7ft high, or 2.1m), swing, and place your legs on the chair.

3. ???

4. Do rows! Profit!

I found it better than other solution like hanging a towel etc, and I hope this helps someone.

I’ve reached a bit of a plateau in my skills progression and I’m having trouble focusing on what I should do next. 

For starters, I worry that I’m a bit limited with my equipment. I don’t have access to a gym so I work out exclusively at home. I’m moving to a new apartment next week and I’m unsure if I could install a pull-up bar or rings as it’s a loft apartment without a lot of door frames. Any creative suggestions how to install a bar and/or rings?

*Some background and goals I’ve already reached:*

Female, 5’6’’, 130lbs


-2x10 Pistol Squats 

-Freestanding Handstand

-60s L-Sit

-15s Straddle L-Sit

-3x10 Hanging Leg Raises

-3x8 Pull-ups

-3x8 Chin-ups

-120s Plank

-3x8 Push-up variations (Regular, Wide, Diamond, Staggered Hands, Chaturanga, etc)




I would love to be able to do a muscle-up, but I’m not even sure how to start training for that. I’m also interested in levers/flags, I’m a rock climber so I see a lot of guys practicing those, but again not sure where to start. Same with V-sits, I have no problem with L-sits, but I’m not quite sure how to make the transition to a V. I’m also not sure how to continue working my legs. I’ve tried to increase the difficulty of pistol squats by adding a jump switch, but not sure there’s much else to add. Beyond that, I'm lost. 

So what comes next? Any advice or guidance would be really helpful.

The next installment in this series is released today, as another challenge.

I'm pretty skinny (5'7, 106lbs) and I want to bulk up. But I must stress that I have a fairly low stamina/energy threshold due to a heart condition.

I should probably also add, that my doctor has said I'm fine to exercise and do weights etc. my mum is just very over-protective.

Anyway, what exercises can I do at home, to start building up my strength, and specifically my biceps, quads, pecks &amp; abs? I have an exercise bike I use from time to time, some small dumbbells (1kg each I think) and I try to do a few rounds of press ups a few times a week, and I am noticing a slight change week by week, but I'd like to just generally build up more and quicker. What can I do? Any good routines you guys have that are low-rep but high intensity? 

Tl;dr: I have a medical condition meaning I can't do tonnes of reps of stuff because I get tired really quickly and my mum won't let me get gym membership, but I want to build up my biceps, pecks, quads &amp; abs. What stuff can I do?

**Before** - http://imgur.com/a/DqlqR

**After** - http://imgur.com/a/jWDON

**Previous level of fitness** : I got tired of doing the FAQ so I decided to give this a try.  I was doing 3x8 of pull up, chin up, wide set pull up, and 3x8-12 of different push up variations and the dip and inverted row work.  I was also up to 5 one armed push ups.  I weighed 128ish before the workout at 5'7"" and maybe gained a lb or two after doing it (unsure due to variability in the scale, I did break 130 afterwards which I've never done before, but some days I weighed in at 128).

**Execution of workout** : Very easy to fit in around a busy schedule.  For the first week I did 5 sets of 20 push ups and 5 sets of 10 pull ups and fit them in during study breaks throughout the day (it was finals).  I later upped that to 4 sets of 25 and 4 sets of 13.

**Thoughts** : I *felt* like my chest had gotten larger, visually, I'm not sure if you can see it, but it felt like I had increased mass on my chest.  I couldn't feel any big difference with my back.  The workout gets really boring towards the end, but it works well as a break to other things.  

Personally, looking at the photos, I don't think there's much change visually and the scale really hasn't changed either.  My elbow started to get really sore towards the end as well which I've never had happen to me before.  A lack of weight gain could be due to not eating enough - I went home for break for part of it and usually eat less at home.  Also I don't really count calories but try to eat ""more"" as I'm trying to gain weight so that could be a factor as well.  

I'll be hanging out on this throwaway for the next day or so so if you have any questions, fire away.  I'm also curious to hear your thoughts/reactions.  

Hope this helps!

1376417887.0,39,self.bodyweightfitness,1kaki4,Just got some rings. Would love some help with my new routine.,DrawInIt,45,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1kaki4/just_got_some_rings_would_love_some_help_with_my/,"**A little background:** I am 22, male, 172 lbs (78 kg). I started doing body weight fitness about 3 months ago and was instantly hooked. Prior to that I did strongman 5x5 (plus pull-ups) for about a year and a half and prior to that I just dicked around at the gym for a year, doing whatever exercises I felt like (no idea what I was doing). I have struggled with back injuries in the past so when I was lifting, my Deadlifts and Squats were always pretty light compared to my upper body lifts. I have not experienced any major back problems in the past year or so but would sometimes feel slight pain when doing deadlifts, squats and bent over rows. Because of this I was still very cautious about putting too much weight on my back. Since making the switch to BWF I have Experienced no back discomfort what so ever. 

I started with the beginner routine and did that for about a month and a half. I then started doing a variation of /u/antranik's routine which is outlined [here](http://antranik.org/bodyweight-training/). I had been doing this routine for about a month and a half before getting my rings two weeks ago. I am still trying to figure out a good balanced routine with the rings.

My routine is split up into three days; pushing day, pulling day, and core-legs-and-more-pulling day. Each workout begins with the same warm up of bodyline and skill work and finishes with a bunch of stretching.  


**Goals**

* Build muscle and just overall stay in shape
* Short term: Freestanding Handstand, Muscle Up
* Long Term: PLanche, Front Lever, Back Lever, Flag Pole, Freestanding Handstand Push Ups

---&gt; This arrow will indicate the goal I am working towards with an exercise.

**Warm up:**

Bodyline

* Plank 60s
* Side Planks 60s
* Dolphin Plank ~50s
* Reverse Plank ~45s
* Hollow Hold ~2x30s
* Reverse Hollow Hold 60s
* Going to add Bird Dog in my next work out.

Skill Work 

* Handstand practice (Belly to wall ~45s, then practicing pushing off into freestanding) ---&gt; Freestanding Handstand
* L-Sit Practice (L-Sits are one of my weaker areas so I start by stretching and doing foot supported on the floor for 60s, then stretching some more and practicing holding myself up on my fingers. I can do tuck L-Sits for about 30s on bars but my form in my shoulders was pretty bad which is why I've gone back to working on the floor. I am also not quite flexible enough to bring my legs up to 90 degrees.)
* Support (before I got my rings I was doing 60s on bars, now I'm doing 2x30s on rings.)

**Day One: Pushing**

Vertical:

* Wall Headstand Push Ups 3x5 (with 3.5 inch foam block under my head) ---&gt; Wall Handstand Push Ups and eventually Freestanding Handstand Push Ups. 
* Ring dips 3x4 (replaced Bar Dips 3x7) ---&gt; Muscle Ups

Horizontal:

* Archer Push ups 3x6 ---&gt; One Armed Push Up
* Ring Push ups 3x8 (too easy, going to try RTO next workout) (replaced Pseudo Planche Pusups 3x8)

**Day Two: Pulling**

Vertical:

* Ring Pull Ups 5,5,5,4,4 (trying less reps per set but more sets to work on form) ---&gt; Muscle Ups
* False Grip Hang 4x15s ---&gt; Muscle Ups

Horizontal:

* Ring Rows 3x6 ---&gt; Front Lever Tucked Rows (Replaced Bar Wide Rows 3x7)
* German Hang 6x10s ---&gt; Back Lever (Replaced TRX Rows)

**Day Three: Core, Legs, More Pulling**

Legs:

* Pistol Squats 5,6,6 ---&gt; Jumping Pistol Squats
* I was also doing Deep Steps but found my legs were too tired when I would go mountain biking on off days.

Core:(Was neglected before I got rings)

* Hanging Leg Raises 3x6 ---&gt; Windshield Wipers

Horizontal Pulling:

* Tuck Front Lever 4x15s ---&gt; Front lever

Vertical Pulling:

* Hollow Body Pull-ups on bar 4,4,3,3 

**Questions**

* Is my routine balanced? If not, what am I lacking and what do I have too much of?
* With my headstands, my plan is to work up to 3x8 with the 3.5 inch block then go down to 2.5 or 2 inches and work up to 3x8 etc. I'll do this until I can do it without a block. Eventually I will get bars and start working my way up to handstand push ups the same way. Removing an inch of the block every time I get to 3x8. Is this a good strategy or since I can do 3x5 should I start reducing the block and once I work my way back to 3x5 or 6 move on?
* I would like to start working towards a Planche, should I start doing frog pose as one of my two horizontal pushes or add it into my skill work? If I replace a horizontal push, which one ?
* I would like to start working towards a flagpole but I'm not strong enough yet to get up into Vertical Flag. Should I start by doing Tucked Flags with something supporting my legs? Or should I wait until I build up more core strength?
* My core is one of my weaknesses and I can see that reflected in my hollow body position as well as things like L-Sits, and L-Hangs. What more can I do to work on my Hollow Body position? Would practicing it at random intervals throughout the day help or just prevent proper rest for my core? 
* I have been advised by multiple chiropractors not to do deadlifts. (Not specifically because of my history but just because they believe they are bad for your back in general). I don't totally buy this but at the same time I still don't feel totally comfortable doing heavy deadlifts because I have had back problems in the past. That being said, I know how important they are and feel my routine is lacking without them. Would it be worth doing them once a week on a lighter weight just to at least engage that muscle group? Would one legged deadlifts with a kettle bell or dumbbell be a reasonable alternative?
* After my last visit to the chiropractor I tried to find information about deadlifts from a medical perspective but couldn't find anything. Basically what I found is chiropractors say they are bad, trainers and bodybuilders say they are good. My theory is that chiropractors think they are bad because they see all the worst cases where people did them with bad form or tried to lift too much and fucked up their backs. Can anyone point me to any kind of medical or scientific based information about deadlifts? Does it even exist?
* I would greatly appreciate any other feedback. If you think my routine sucks and have a suggestion for a total overhaul let me know. Don't hold anything back, I'm hear to learn. 

Thanks in advance. You guys are awesome!

So I need to work on my flexibility before I can really throw myself into all things bodyweight.

So I am trying to set flexibility goals that adhere to the S.M.A.R.T. model. The problems I am having are with the measurable and time and resource constrained parts. I get really discouraged because I feel I am making no progress so I end up being able to break my will.

It's unlike mud runs (Spartan Race, Warrior Dash, Run for Your Lives, etc) as there's no mud, no running, just obstacles. You have the option to compete in a timed manner for a cash prize as either an individual or a team. Me personally, I might get some people to go to the Ohio one and just attempt to complete it, no time. 

Prices run $60-90 when I look at open registration for California, but FAQ says $90-150 depending on how early/late you register. Not too sure on that. Have to check back when you can register for your area. Get same shit as other runs, t-shirt, some swag. 

Locations: Texas, California, Colorado, Ohio, Tennessee, Tristate (guessing NJ/Ny area), Virginia, Georgia, and Florida as of now. 

Onto the good stuff. [Obstacles](http://www.alphawarrior.com/obstacles):   
Barrels  
Rings....like a series of rings like monkey bars  
Monkey bars  
Spider Wall (like Ninja Warrior with two glass sheets)  
All kinds of different bars you jump from/to

I get that it depends on my commitment and effort, but I also don't mind a reality check if you really think something like a handstand press just isn't going to happen for someone as old as me who is starting from scratch (I feel like most people on here are much younger).

My numbers right now are pushups-120, situps-120, pullups-32, swim-9:00ish, run-7:45. These numbers weren't done in a PST, they are just my maxes for each event.

I would like to be able to do 150+ pushups and situps and 40+ pullups to get the best score I can on the test.

My current training program looks something like this:

**Monday**: Short swim intervals (usually 50s, about 1500 yds total), pushups (from [this](http://hundredpushups.com/week3.html#sthash.0fniPHdS.dpbs) site, I double the numbers), situps from [this](http://www.twohundredsitups.com/) site, pullups from [this](http://50pullups.com/50-pullups-programme/31-35-pullups) site, and then short running intervals like repeat 200s.

**Tuesday**: Upper body lifting (rows, bench, OHP, dips, bis and tris) and weighted pullups, then an easy 3-5 mile run.

**Wednesday**: Medium distance swim intervals (usually repeat 100s, about 1500 yds total), then pushups situps and pullups using the above mentioned sites, then medium distance running intervals (400s-800s)

**Thursday**: Lower body lifting day (front squat, deadlift, lunge) and weighted pullups, then an easy 3-5 mile run

**Friday**: Long distance swim (~1000-1500 yds plus some underwater stuff for about ~2000 yds total), then pushups situps and pullups from the above sites, then running interval workout (pyramid from 200-1200m and back down)

**Saturday:Long** distance run (6-8 miles)

**Sunday:Mass** cal day (accumulate 300-500 pushups and situps and 200-300 pullups throughout the day)

When I flex at the hip with my leg in anatomical position, there's no discomfort, but if I flex at the hip with the leg externally rotated, there's a discomfort that is located at what feels like the anterior inferior iliac spine.

The pain on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst, is maybe a 1 or 2 and it doesn't radiate or shoot anywhere. It's not especially bothersome, but I'm worried that I may have strained or irritated my iliofemoral ligament.

Is there anything I can do in addition to rest to resolve this? What can I do to prevent this in the future?



**EDIT:** Following eshlow and ispariz's advice, I tried various stretches of the muscles around the hip. I actually didn't realize there were targeted stretches isolating hip flexors, so I learned something new today.  

A stretch specific for the iliopsoas that I found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0j9kHFUZyQ) [demonstration of the stretch starts at 2:33, but her commentary before that is also useful in explaining the importance of the stretch] seemed to relieve the discomfort the most. [Here](http://www.fix-knee-pain.com/psoas-stretch/) are some more good stretches.

Hopefully this post will help anyone who experiences similar symptoms.

I am now going to start adding whey protein into my daily eating routine to get more muscle emphasis. Was wondering what would be good to maintain that lean-cut look and possible increase size in certain muscle groups for that extra ""damn that guy is really cut"" look.

Now here's some handbalancing notes:

* Having a teacher to poke at you is a VERY good idea. Having people touch you increases proprioception and helps you move things properly
* Forward flexion flexibility is super important - stretch your pike in between sets of handstands while resting
* Tension Drill: Lie on the floor face down with your arms overhead. Engage your glutes and lift your legs off the ground just like an arch hold (keep them squeezed together and toes pointed!). Keeping the glutes engaged, knees locked, and toes pointed, lift your belly button off the floor (your legs will come down and make contact, that's fine - just keep the glutes engaged). Repeat this slowly for a few reps

I'm sure there's more that will come to me later, but I just wanted to throw this out there.

Using push ups as an example, is it better to focus on low reps EVEN if you can knock out 25+ at a time? We'd knock out 50 rep sets for squats back in out heyday but we were also benching 300 pounds, too.

Because I was, with my feet against the wall, like you're supposed to when you haven't mastered it yet.
Just minding my own business, when this guy (who worked there, I later found out) told me, in a very unfriendly manner, to get off the wall.
Apparently it's not acceptable to do that at the gym because your shoes will leave marks on the wall.
I tried to talk to him about it, offered to do it barefoot so I wouldn't leave marks, but he just remained very rude and told me I wasn't allowed to do that here, period.

So now I don't know what to do.
I went to another gym near me and inquired if it was ok if I would practice my handstand here, but the lady at the counter also told me no. (Though atleast she was friendly about it.)
I can't work out at home because a) don't have that much room in my flat (I'm a student) and b) I just can't motivated myself to work out at home all alone, there's just too much distraction. I need a ""work out environment"", like a gym.

I have a lot of *mental resistance* to actually going through with a back flip.  I have done it a few times on a trampoline with great resistance even then.  I can do front flips on the trampoline all day but the back flip... the idea of throwing my head back and it going upside down in that direction is something that's going *totally against my instinct*.

I noticed I have the same mental resistance to performing [dislocates on the flying rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PS2kW-vPb0).  Again, it's the same exact motion that makes my head and body go upside down and over like a back flip.  I have done it maybe a dozen times on the flying rings, but it took a lot of commitment through actually going through with it.  In the end, it's a very natural motion that's actually pretty safe, but my BRAIN thinks it's a terrible idea.

The only time I could get myself to do it consistently is on a springboard into a pool, but I don't have access to that anymore.

**Are there any training exercises/progressions/tips/tricks that could help my brain get used to this fear of going backwards?**

ETA: I've been going through some crappy youtube videos, but I found [this little gem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16P2XAuUb5g) that explains how to master the back handspring first, and then to move onto the back flip.

Sitting aggravates the pain, while stretching helps.

After reviewing my x-rays, the doctor says I have a loss of lumbar lordosis, and likely muscle spasm causing the pain. I am going for massage therapy tomorrow, but physio is unavailable. 

So I would appreciate a little bit of help: how can I slowly stretch out my lower body and deal with my loss of lordosis, while making sure that whatever is causing the pain isn't aggravated? If it's just a muscle spasm, is a regular push-pull routine okay, or should I focus only on stretching and rehab work? My main idea is to improve my shitty posture, and I've been doing that 12-minute foundation video for the last few days.

 I'm considering building a rehab routine for my off-days, and continuing to do my workout on my regular days. The pain is manageable without medication, but I am quite sore by the end of the day.

And yes, I know you all are not a doctor, but I'd really appreciate your advice nonetheless - maybe someone else has dealt with similar?

Hey guys, 

Eric Cressey went over this pretty well. I know some people were asking me a bit back about what the scapular movement should be in the pushup and it is explained and demonstrated well here.

http://www.ericcressey.com/strength-training-programs-scapular-movement-push-up

Scapular movement among different exercises isn't always the same. For example, with bench press you generally want them retracted and depressed. With some movements the scapulas should be moving during the entire exercise.

So hopefully this will help some of you understand what should be happening with the scapulas during pushup type movements.

The point of this thread is to discuss flexibility - techniques, tools, struggles, and hardships.

The current topic du jour: the [thoracic spine](http://www.spinalstenosis.org/images/thoracic-spine.gif) or t-spine. It makes up most of your back, approximately from the bottom of your neck down to your belly button. Most people don't know if t-spine mobility is a problem for them, until them attempt things like back bridges, overhead squats, or handstands. T-spine extension is what allows you to ""sit tall"" in the bottom of a squat, and what allows a [rounded back bridge](http://www.costaricayoga.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/yoga-thebridge.jpg) instead of one with excessive [lumbar bending](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TT5JHVos4wk/TdfNqkSqBBI/AAAAAAAAAEA/LPua4hlzlfY/s1600/wheel.jpg).

So give us your t-spine mobility and flexibility tips.

Which is probably why I've made nearly no progress in that regard.

I know what muscles need work, but it seems that especially the ones that need fixing if I want to get rid of anterior pelvic tilt are the ones that are hard to train without weights. Upper body I'm getting in better shape because working shoulders and focusing on the back is so much easier. But legs..

If I'm not mistaken the ones that need work in the lower body are the hamstrings, the glutes and the abs.

For abs I do planks and knee raises, which I guess is fine.

But I'm not sure what to do with the rest. I did goblet squats for a while but my 70 lbs kettlebell was maxed out rather quickly. I have a hard time doing lunges or bulgarian squats without falling over. So I tried to do a pistol progression. But I've been stuck for months.

I tried the rolling pistols approach but after a few sets I'm mostly out of breath not having felt any muscle used while tumbling around like an idiot. Usually the quads cramp up because keeping the other leg straight is nearly impossible for me.

More direct approaches like glute bridges didn't help either because they became too easy far too fast.
Now I'm not sure what I could do instead. I know I have to work on pistols a little more because I need to train my legs anyway.

I've tried false grip pullups and hangs on the rings and bar, none of which seemed very doable, and more recently settled on false grip ring rows, which seem like the most scaled down version possible, but I'm running into similar issues with each. Whenever I try it I think I must be misunderstanding the grip somehow because it feels so wrong, but I don't think I am. My problems are:  

* I'm not able to fully extend my arms at the bottom while maintaining the false grip. As I extend, I start to feel a strong pulling sensation on the inside of my elbows, and it feels like either my wrists or my elbows need to give up their position. I'm also not 100% sure about what the wrist position should actually look like at the very bottom of these movements. The rings are technically supposed to turn out at the bottom, right? And is the wrist meant to stay at 90 degrees of flexion the whole time? Or does the wrist angle open up slightly towards the bottom?  

* I get pain/pressure on the top surface of my wrist during the movement, moreso on my left wrist. When I flex that wrist maximally and then return it to netural, it consistently produces a noticeable (but not painful) pop. My right wrist doesn't do that.    

* It hurts on the inside of my wrist where it rests on the ring. This is unsurprising and I assume I just need to grow calluses and HTFU, but any tips are appreciated.  

Last night I tried to work false grip ring rows and ended up doing 7, 5, and 5. I think they were decent other than the fact that I couldn't get my arms all the way straight, but I was frustrated by how painful and difficult they were. Earlier in the workout I had done chinups with +40 lbs. for 5, 5, and 8 reps at 175 bodyweight.  

Is there some other mobility or strength work I should be doing before, or to supplement, the false grip rows?  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPDATE**: I went to the gym and got photos of the way I was doing it before, with the rings on the wrist below my hand, and the new way, with the rings on the bottom part of my palm, based on the video linked by /u/CaptSimian. The latter felt much better, and with it I was able to do 3 sets of 10 ring rows with a minimum of discomfort.  

[Old way 1](http://i.imgur.com/jFSNvBz.jpg), [old way 2](http://i.imgur.com/tZwWCxN.jpg), [old way 3](http://i.imgur.com/t8mR6F1.jpg). Note the lack of extension and the look of agony on my face.  

Contrast that with: [new way 1](http://i.imgur.com/AVrxsWQ.jpg), [new way 2](http://i.imgur.com/KZVW7Vy.jpg), [new way 3](http://i.imgur.com/WDdmItB.jpg). Note the placid facial expression and full elbow extension. I'm not sure yet how this will feel when applied to other movements, though.  

So does this look right? Is my grip ""false enough?""

In the course of a practice, there are arm balances, head and handstands, elbow lever, tons of squats, with a tuck planche from seated into the bottom half of a pushup and then a dive bomber pushup, and then a jump through to l-sit between each posture (in yoga, just called a jump back and jump through). Eventually there are one-hand handstands and elbow levers, no momentum hand vaults and flips etc (http://www.absolutelyashtanga.com/yoga_5.html). Obviously there is more a premium on twisting and bending in yoga, but there is a lot of drilling at skill and steady regular progression. Plus, like I've noted, there are some similar moves. The big difference is that we're only holding a pose for usually 5 breaths. So there isn't nearly as much emphasis on sustained strength and only limited progression for some movements.

All this to say, is that I have become more and more interested in some of the skills and strength building I see here, in addition to my yoga practice. To that end, I have started doing 2-3 strength training workouts a week. Sometimes I only get around to 2 of these. TBH, the yoga is the priority, so I want to be able to miss a strength training session here and there without entirely mucking things up. Here is my routine right now:

* Pullups: http://twentypullups.com/week-4/ (I'm on day three, my max is 12 right now)
* L-sit: 3x20
* Pushups: I'm doing the Perfect Pushup progressions (http://apankow.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/pp-poster.jpg)
* Elbow-lever: 1x60 (with some skill training for 1 armed)
* Tuck Planche: 2x30
* Wall sit
* Pistol squats: http://www.alkavadlo.com/2011/08/29/the-twenty-pistol-squat-challenge/ (Intermediate)
* Back lever: 6x10 (alternating one leg tucked in)
* Advanced Tuck Front Lever: 5x12
* Ab wheel roll-outs

Questions (besides a general critique):

* How can I work HSPU into this? (currently I can jump into handstand using both legs and also want to eventually be able to pike into handstand)
* Do you feel like I'm missing something? Or would majorly benfit from removing or adding some type of movement?
* Ideas for other fun skill-based things I can swap in and out and/or work on in spare moments (remembering that I want to do all types of movements in one workout?)

I've got to hit the hay, looking forward to reading any and all responses in the AM!

**Dissimilar effects of one- and three-set strength training on strength and muscle mass gains in upper and lower body in untrained subjects.**

Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 2007, 21(1), 157–163
 2007 National Strength &amp; Conditioning Association

BENT R. RøNNESTAD, WILHELM EGELAND, NILS H. KVAMME, PER E. REFSNES, FAWZI KADI, AND TRULS RAASTAD

Norwegian College of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway; National Sports Center, Oslo, Norway; Department of Health Sciences, University of Örebro, Örebro, Sweden; Centre for Continuing Education, Lillehammer University College, Lillehammer, Norway.

intro:  
&gt; ... report that strength gains with different strength training regimens can vary dramatically from one muscle group to another. Therefore, the response to single- vs. multiple-set strength training could possibly be different in diverse muscle groups.

previous work:  
&gt; ... who observed that leg muscles responded to a greater extent to 3-set strength training when compared with single-set strength training, while there were no differences in upper-body muscle response between the 2 training regimens in untrained men.

results of study:  
note: 3L-1UB is 3 sets legs, 1 set upper body; 1L-3UB is 1 set legs, 3 upper body  
&gt; The increase in 1RM from week 0 to 11 in the lower-body exercises was signiﬁcantly higher in the 3L-1UB group
than in the 1L-3UB group (... Figure 1 left panel). There were no signiﬁcant differences between groups in 1RM changes in upper-body exercises (Figure 1 right panel).
figure 1: http://imgur.com/4H15W4j

discussion:  
&gt; Based on the results of the present study, it is difﬁcult to point out the reasons why upper-body muscles are not as responsive to differences in training volume as leg muscles. One possible explanation is that we use leg muscles in daily-life activities to a greater extent than our upper-body muscles. As a consequence, some of the growth potential in the leg muscles might already be reached through daily activities, meaning they are better trained than the upper-body muscles in subjects not committed to regular strength training. Furthermore, trained muscles seem to beneﬁt more from a larger training volume than relatively untrained muscles. However, if the upper-body muscles are less trained than leg muscles, a greater increase in relative strength should be expected in upper-body muscles than in the leg muscles. This was, however, not the case since relative strength increased more in the leg muscles than in the upper-body muscles. Based on this ﬁnding the opposite conclusion may be drawn; **the upper-body muscles need a higher training volume (&gt;3 sets) than leg muscles to beneﬁt from multiple-set strength training protocols** [emphasis added]. ... found that 6 sets in biceps curl were superior to 1 set during 12 weeks of training in untrained subjects.

Details on procedure:  

- the muscles measured: ""thigh muscles and trapezius muscle""  
- progress measured by: ""The 1RM testing was performed in leg press, leg extension, leg curl, seated chest press, seated rowing, latissimus pull-down, biceps curl, and shoulder press""  
- training was ""3 times per week on nonconsecutive days.""

-----

Has anyone heard about upper body requiring more volume, or have resources (journal article, book, advice from gym bro) that suggest this is a good idea? Or alternatively that it's a bad idea? Off the top of my head, evidence that more volume is good would be grease-the-groove for pullups.

I'm thinking about testing out some additional upper body volume for a few weeks, but haven't committed to it yet. I'm making solid gains with the program I'm on, so there's not really a *reason* to change, but I'm wondering if I could make better progress with more work ... I'm also not sure if I should go from 3x5 to 6x5, or just add some light work on rest days, any suggestions?",,False,,t5_2tf0a,1371482297.0,,,True,t3_1gioon,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gioon/would_upper_body_strength_increase_faster_with/,

Any ideas? ,brandon7s,36,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/190jpq/looking_for_some_more_bodyweight_drillsexercises/," I'm looking to get back into the kind of condition I was in while training in Krav Maga; never in my life have I been in better shape than after 9 months of training in it. I mostly took it for the fitness benefits, though the self-defense aspect was a nice perk. 
 
I don't have the money to spend on classes anymore, nor the patience to drive out to the closest studio to train in. So, I decided I'm going to try to do this on my own, in my garage. Most of the workout in Krav Maga class was from bodyweight exercises and drills: 

* burpees 
* jumping jacks 
* planks (on elbows) 
* pushups
* bodyweight squats
* lunges
* crunches

you know, the kind of things that are typically for training in a lot of different sports. 

 My plan is to come up with a circuit of drills to do and do them in a HIIT fashion, something like: 15x burpees, 20x squats, 10x pushups, 30x jumping jacks, 5x pullups, and then a minute (or less) rest before repeating. Might change it to time instead of reps, since that's more like HIIT. 

 My question for you fine folks here is: **what other drills can I add to my training to make it more interesting and thorough?** The ones I listed above are the only ones I know of that I can do without a workout partner or additional equipment. My only equipment right now is a doorway pullup bar; however, I do plan on making a dip station later on. Do you think there anything else that I should add as well?

 I'm just looking for endurance and cardiovascular health at the moment. Later on I'd like to add bodyweight strength training (and muscle mass), but that's not my concern at the moment. Right now I just want to feel like less of a slob and get my body moving the way it was at my peak fitness level.",,False,,t5_2tf0a,False,,,True,t3_190jpq,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/190jpq/looking_for_some_more_bodyweight_drillsexercises/,

I've been doing 30-50 miles per week with most weeks in the low 40s. I've gotten pretty scrawny from all the running and I decided I want to gain a bit of muscle and functional upper body strength. 

Last week I started CC. I plan on following the progressions as stated in the book with the specified rep numbers. I've set up a routine, but I want to know if it would be worth it to run as much as I want and do CC. On days that I do CC I will be doing all 6 main exercises. 

The following is my weekly plan-

Sunday: CC and 3-5 mile run
Monday: 6-10 mile run or 5 miles of interval training
Tuesday: Whichever thing I don't do Monday
Wednesday: CC and 3-5 mile run
Thursday:6-10 mile run
Friday: CC and 3-5 mile run
Saturday:Rest

Here are my questions.

1) Is running going to interfere with my ability to gain strength and size? 
2) Would it be more beneficial to follow CC with the 3x8-10 rep method (like in the FAQ) than the reps specified in the book?
3) Should I be doing CC 4 times a week or will 3 times a week be sufficient?

My ultimate goal is to increase my flexibility and strengthen my upper body. I also want to be able to do handstand pushups.

I know it isn't perfect by far, I just want to know if I'm making good progress for 8 months? Before I started doing my bodyweight exercises I was about 200 pounds and I'm only 5'8, I don't know if that necessarily makes it harder to progress since I wasn't exactly the most fit.

I can hold that position for about ~5 seconds.

My next steps for improving it are to straighten myself out so I'm parallel to the floor, rather than that 20ish degree bend, and then after that I want to be able to do it from the floor rather than a bar (or in my case, the edge of my bed), and I'm hoping that I can at least hold myself parallel from my floor for ~3-5 seconds by new years. And after I get all that done I'm gonna work on Straightening my arms fully out. I can do a Planche Push up with my current planche but I can't hold the position.

We are starting the process of deciding which, if any, images for new progression we will be inserting into the 2nd edition of OG.

I am likely going to add at least bodyweight squats though I haven't decided on if I want to insert SLS/pistols in yet. I'll have to continue to think about it as I still like barbell squats/deadlifts over SLS/pistol.

We will be likely inserting an explosive pushups progression. Hanging leg raises, and rings flys are under consideration. We will have some illustrations for the one arm handstand progression (which there isn't currently), and what rings turned out actually looks like.

Are there any other exercise progressions you would like to see in the next version of OG?

I can't promise you we WILL add any suggestions, but all advice will be taken under consideration! It's actually pretty tough to decide on different variations and try to integrate them into the existing charts.

------------------------------------

So having been helping out here for a bit there's always been some interest in how best to integrate barbells with bodyweight exercises, especially in the context of gymnastics type bodyweight exercises. Most people tend to associate with either just barbells or just bodyweight exercises, and that's not good because you're taking away a lot of the tools in your tool box that can be useful for you to meet your goals.

You don't have to build a foundation before you move to one or the other. And you don't have to be elistist for one or the other. Both are great methods of training, and combined they can be even more awesome.

Thus, this article was born to try to lay a foundation for those who want to puts these types of exercises together to gain strength and/or hypertrophy.

In the beginning, it's kind of a pain in the ass to workout without seeing much progress, but stay consistent long enough and you'll really start seeing it! I started out at 16yrs 5'6 + 1/2 137lbs. Dirty bulking after the first 2 months for around another 2 months and slowly going up from there... I'm 155 as of this morning. Ain't even close to fat yet my bmi is near the ""overweight"" parameters!

I began with diamond pushups. Working hard for just the 3x8 and lately  been doing incline straddle one arm pushups for a good few months. As of today I'm still working hard just for 3x8... but I'm only 11 inches off the fucking floor! Attempted a one-arm pushup after researching good form on youtube a little, and the rest is history! 

Wasn't even that hard to push back up. Did a rep on each arm while feeling I could do more, yet I still got a workout to do so I held back. Thought about skipping the 3x8 goal and just doing gtg for a week or two til I could get 3x3 but don't feel like it!

I made more progress in 2 months of a good routine than 6 months of following CC to the exact word. Wish I could go back to then, but I'm glad I learned some discipline at the very least. 

Even with the loose shirts I wear I still look a lot bigger and I get compliments all the time from people I haven't seen in a while saying I look ""big"" or at least in comparison to my skinny self from before. I always assumed all social anxiety would dissipate the moment I was stronger than most ""fit"" kids in my school, and I gotta say it doesn't hurt!

To maintain a stable midline during pull-ups, Starrett recommends that you ""straighten out your legs, position your feet together, and point your toes. Squeeze your butt and balance your ribcage over your pelvis"". I've tested this in the gym, and it definitely feels like a superior position compared to how I train at home (using a power tower where I have to bend my legs to stay off the ground). And may also explain why I occasionally get issues with my shoulders after doing workouts which emphasise pull-ups (Starrett discusses how doing a pull-up from an overextended position - e.g. with your legs hooked behind your body - will create a situation where you're applying torque to your shoulders from an unstable position). 

Anyone else experienced issues with doing pull-ups from a low bar? I'm considering if there's a way to perform the exercise with good form using a low bar, or if it's time to bite the bullet and rig up a proper high bar in my backyard.

So here's a post that's originating out of a certain amount of focused frustration that I hope bares fruit. I want to know what the least amount of exercise I have to do to maintain my ideal weight and level of fitness.

I'm a musician and film editor. I travel a lot, and when I don't, I'm working from home. Bodyweight exercises are ideal because I don't always have access to equipment. Plus, there's something so zen about it. The one thing I do really enjoy is skipping, so that's the one tool I want to use.

So here's the thing: I want to get away from routines. Often, when I'm working from home, I find it easier to do a few reps of some exercise or the other roughly every hour - maybe three rounds of squats, pushups, situps, you name it. It charges me up and keeps me going. I get a rush to continue with my work, gets the creative juices flowing. However, I shy away from doing this as I feel it's useless and won't achieve the results that a focused half hour or hour long routine would.

Am I wrong? 

Can I reach and even maintain my ideal weight and fitness level by doing this? It feels easier, more enjoyable, and thus more sustainable. Everything else feels like a chore. I want to find a way of keeping fit that I enjoy and that motivates me.

I figured it would be good to release this because structuring loading parameters is difficult for most people to do, especially in regard to these two different types of exercises. This article serves to help answer the questions in regards to building strength and hypertrophy:

* How long do the sets need to be?

* Why are they that length?

* What overall volume (sets x holds) is good for these types of exercises

Well a few months ago I was your typical extremely skinny guy but after that I was sick of it I decided to do a Starting Strength variant and have since absolutely loved working out.

So first of all I don't even know if it's possible given Gymnasts seem to all be young guys that have developed them for well over a decade. I'm 20 at the moment and am still quite unmuscular. Would it be possible by the time I'm 30? Or would that be too late? [This should give you an idea of what I'm going for.](http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/2/1/215b9-Building_the_Gymnastic_Body.jpg) It should be noted that I'm not trying to be a Gymnast, just look like one. I'd kill to be able to take Gymnastics classes but I don't have the money - I figure aiming for their body now would greatly benefit me when I get the chance to take classes.

I originally planned on showing you guys a basic plan but I've decided against it. But instead, I'll collate all the information from this thread and post a plan afterwards to see what you guys think.

So I have one hour per day to work out. I have access to a bench press (and barbell), chin up bar, and I'm quite good at Macguivering any other bodyweight equipment - like seats for hyperextensions. Give me your worst!

Not everyone cares this much about their weight, but for those of us who do, this is a pretty cool tracker!  

And simple to use: Just add your starting weight to cells C2 and K2, then add your weight each day in column C.  

To adjust the charts to reflect your weight range, click on the chart, go to the ribbon at the top and click Chart Tools &gt; Format; in the far left of that menu, select Vertical Axis and change the ranges - that last step varies depending on which version of Excel you're in; in 2013, a panel opens on the right where you can change the min and max.  You can do the same thing with the dates by selecting Horizontal Axis - otherwise, it'll start with today.

""Training to improve the muscle-up"" or ""Improving the muscle-up,"" take your pick.)



One of my first goals when I started training on the rings was to do a muscle-up. I achieved it a few weeks ago, and this week hit a PR of 5 consecutive reps. [Here's an out-of-focus video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lScxCTgwnN0), but I think you can see what's going on well enough.  

So now that I can perform the basic movement, I want to make it better. I can see that when I do the muscle-up, I lean my torso forward and pike at the hips a lot during the transition, and I've seen it done with a much straighter body. I also could improve it by making it more slow and controlled on the way up and the way down. I could do it with a wider grip or in an L-sit, I could do it with added weight, and I could simply keep adding reps.  

So my questions are, what makes the most sense to focus on at first, and what's the best method to train for it? Stick with the full movement or break it up into drills? Grease the groove or go for max reps?  

(My gym has pullup handles on the power rack instead of a regular pullup bar, which I think makes it a little easier -- I've [done 3 on those](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVyZrh0XzKI), although I have done them a few times on an actual bar.)",,False,,t5_2tf0a,1369694385.0,,,True,t3_1f3ra0,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1f3ra0/training_to_improving_the_muscleup/,

So my long term goals are pretty far-fetched, but i think with sufficient time and training i can accomplish this.

My goals are to be able to do handstand push ups, one arm push ups, one arm pull ups/chin ups and front lever rows. So as the beginner routine in the FAQ says, i would do

Warm up

Skill work (handstand, l-sit)

3x8 Row progression

3x8 One arm push up progression

3x8 One arm chinup/pullup progression (alternate between pullup and chinup every other workout)

3x8 Handstand push up progression

3x5 Barbell squats, maybe add in deadlift

I just have a few questions.

1. I am an athlete, and running/cardio is important to me. I am not running to lose weight, merely for the cardio aspect of it. so if I eat more, will the running still affect my gains?

2. What is the purpose of the ""support"" mentioned in the faq, and how do you go about doing it?

3. Would it be bad to add a more intense leg workout based on increasing my vertical jump instead of squats?

1364854690.0,32,self.bodyweightfitness,1bgpc8,"Beginner. Read the sidebar, still have lots of theory questions.",DatHarass,34,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1bgpc8/beginner_read_the_sidebar_still_have_lots_of/,"Hi!

I'm a 17 year old guy (5'8"" 144lbs) and have recently decided that it would be a good idea to get into some body-weight fitness (and some simple weightlifting) for strength. As of right now I've been doing full body workouts 3 or 4 times a week for the past 3 weeks. I was already in good shape to begin with, so I'm not a COMPLETE beginner.

I've been reading a huge amount on the science behind strength training. I've read about the necessity for caloric surplus for muscle gains, the idea of hypertrophy and micro-tears in the muscle and lots on diet and food types. What I'm trying to say is that I'm familiar with the 'theory' behind strength training and muscle development, but I still have some questions that I'm struggling to find answers to.

This is what a typical 'routine' looks like at the moment:

I do every exercise with a 60 sec rest between each set. I cycle through the exercises, rather than doing them in succession. So I will do chest ---&gt; legs----&gt;back----&gt;chest----&gt;legs----&gt;back----&gt;chest
rather than chest----&gt;chest----&gt;chest---&gt;back-----&gt;back---&gt;back----&gt;legs-----&gt;legs----&gt;legs.
The routine takes me about 45 minutes and consists of 
4x12 rep difficult pushup variation or dips (I say 'difficult' because I make sure that whatever variation it is, I make sure I can barely do 12 of them)
3x8 rep one leg squat
3x40 rep one leg calf raises
3x12 dip position leg raises
4x12 elevated feet rows (no chinup bar yet!)
4x some ab exercise like bicycles, crunches, twists, or L-sit for as long as possible.

Usually this routine takes me about 45 minutes. At the end of it my arms feel tight and really worked and my abs will feel it if I move them too. Usually I struggle to do the last rep of each exercises near the end of the routine.

Hear are my questions!

1. Should I be doing the cycle routine, or is it more effective to do the same exercise in succession? eg: chest, chest, chest, legs, legs, legs, back, back, back vs chest, legs, back, chest, legs back, chest legs, back.

2. I've only been doing this for 3 weeks but have had a few issues that have caused some confusion. The last time I did my routine was 2 days ago, and I intended to do it again today. However, I decided to try to one arm curl a 40lb dumbbell to see if I had gotten any stronger (3 weeks ago I could BARELY curl it with kind of shitty form). I picked the weight up and wasn't even close to being able to curl it. I felt slightly weaker on the curl than 3 weeks ago. This made me think that perhaps I'm either overtraining myself on workout days (which seems kind of unlikely, but it is usually pretty intense) or I'm not giving myself enough rest between workout days. I've noticed a slight improvement in my L-sit and my pushups feel a tiny bit better, but my curling is definitely worse. My thinking is that either my small muscles (biceps, etc) need more time to recover than abs and chest - which seems odd - or I should just straight up give myself more recovery time overall (like 3 days between workouts). What do you thing I'm doing wrong?

3. How should my exercises FEEL when I'm doing them? Usually in my last 2 sets of an exercises my last rep is pretty much failure or ALMOST failure. Is this too excessive? 

4. I was watching some videos by this guy:http://www.youtube.com/user/jlvi13 who has a bunch of awesome bodyweight fitness videos. He was saying that for his abdominal workouts, he only works out 5 minutes a week. He just does a really, really intense workout for them. This made me again think that what I was doing is excessive and not giving myself enough time to recover, but I'm still really not sure.

5. How important is purposely eating more to gain muscle and strength? I've been purposely eating about 400-500 calories more each day and have gained about 1.5 pounds in the past 3 weeks. Again, I haven't noticed a huge amount of strength increases, so most of that weight is probably fat. Is it necessary that I keep this up, or will my body naturally start partitioning calories towards muscle devlopment and I will find I'm naturally inclined to start eating more/gaining weight?

I know this is a lot of questions, but I've been searching for answers to these questions for hours and hours and I've been having a really hard time. Thanks for any advice you can give me!

I have just spent the past two months recovering from an illness, and now I am ready to get back into the gym. But this time, I want to do it correctly.

**Here's my situation:** I am currently training for parkour twice a week (Thursday and Saturday). Training usually involves some bodyweight training and what I would classify as cardio. I would like to add weightlifting and cardio and later possibly Yoga or Muay Thai to that regimen.

**My goals:** To develop functional strength and general fitness. What I mean by that is that I am not so much interested in raw strength or aeshetics - I figure any decent programme will get me some of those anywys - but rather in *explosive strength, endurance and body control*.

**The plan:** So, I have five days per week left to do training. I was thinking about adding Starting Strength style training on Monday and Wednesday. Something like the Practical Programming for Novices. (Day A: Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift; Day B: Squat, Press, Pull-ups). Then I could still go running on my other off days.

**My questions:**

1.) How should I combine strength training and the bodyweight/skills/cardio training? If I am going to add weightlifting, yoga and Muay Thai, I am going to need to train more than once per day. I was always told to never combine strength and cardio on the same day, but the FAQ doesn't seem to be adverse to that.

2.) Would SS be a good program for my goals? I know that it is primarily geared at developing strength and not power, but I figure that the most important part is moving the most weight possible. Still, perhaps a more specific program would be better.

3.) How should I go about starting the programming? Does it make sense to work on mobility and core stability before taking up a program? The reason I am asking is because when I went to the gym, I was always ridiculously tight and didn't really make any progress, mobility-wise. And my left hip seems to be weaker than my right, which is somewhat notable when squatting (my pelvis tilts a little to the left and backwards). Should I do some single-leg work before jumping into a weightlifting program? If so, what exercises to you recommend.

Thanks!

I have been doing a mix of bodyweight and freeweight exercises for 6 months now (before that, it was only freeweights on bastardization of SS for around 6 months) with the goal of being able to do some bodyweight feats. Stand-to-stand bridge among them. 

Well, first I'd like to be able to do a bridge at all. I started with Convict Conditioning progression and I am doing Straight Bridges fine. However, for the life of me, I cannot get my arms straight during an angled bridge. I have tried different height benches/tables, but I can barely get myself off it. 

Of course I know that overall my upper body is weaker than my lower. I am only at Horizontal Pulls with Pull-up progression - after vertical, I couldn't pull myself up to hip-level bar, so I started with the bar at my chest level and only in 3 months have I been able to get to a point where I can do 3x6 on hip level. With Pushups I am at Half Pushup, although I did 3x8 last time so it might be fair to say that I will be doing Full Pushups next time.

Could it be a flexibility issue instead? I am not very flexible overall. My hamstrings are definitely tight on the lower body and my shoulders look a bit angled forward even when I am pushing them back and down, by neck a bit too much forward, although I am not the worst case in this. I have been able to train myself to pack my shoulders while hanging from a bar and I am doing Hanging Knee Raises already in leg raise progression.

What do you suggest I could try to get to a better point with this? Maybe a specific stretch or some kind of (weighted?) exercise for my arms?  Should I just wait until my upper body catches up to my lower back in this? Has anyone else had such problem, how did you fix it?

I am trying to reduce my body fat with workouts from www.12minuteathlete.com. Basically I do the 12-minute workouts, they are based on the HIIT-principle.

I know it's helpful to gain muscles if you want to lose fat.

So here's the actual question:
Is it helpful to do bodyweight workouts (for example 4 days per week) additionally? Or are those HIIT workouts sufficing?

Maybe some information about my body is helpful:

body height: 181cm

body weight: ~82 kg

Until now I did bodyweight exercises for more than 1 year, following a book from Mark Lauren ( 'You are your own gym' or something like that).

Answered! ~~First off, my support hold sucks ass. Should I just work on a normal support hold before even attempting dips, pushups, pullups and rows on them? I can do rings pushups, pullups and rows, but I have seen on this subreddit that tendonitis is a possibility if one jumps into ring work too soon.~~

Second, is work on the rings worth being supplemented with a bar, or can I make the full transition from my door-mounted pullup bar to the rings? (I mean for practicing levers)

Third, which is sort of off-topic from the other two questions, but why can I not seem to get elbow levers down? Before I even attempt that movement on rings, I'd like to have a solid one on the ground first. I know I can support my weight on my arms (only 150 lbs), however they feel weak and almost crushed when I lean onto them. I also have the ridiculous fear of falling on my face (which wouldn't be that bad from the 7 inches I would be off the ground, which is also holding back my handstand progress) Any tips?

If you want to improve your body through training, you should at least know what muscles you're training, and how they work together.  This is not to take away from the ""train movements, not muscles"" philosophy, as that is still a very important concept, especially for beginners.  But as you advance in training, you should begin to learn what is actually happening inside of you.


In this thread, I'm requesting that you post any free anatomy courses, recourses, diagrams, or anything that could be useful to our readers in learning about the musculoskeletal system.

I started doing pull-ups two weeks ago (I have a history as a rock climber, but that was ~6 years ago, I did pull-ups irregularly up until ~2 years ago). I wanted to roughly follow this [programme](http://harrycloudfoot.com/2012/05/11/self-experiment-barstarrz-increase-your-pull-ups-reviewed-get-mad-results-in-6-weeks/), I am on _week 2, day 4_. After _week 1, day 1_ I could not stretch my arms in elbows (because of [DOMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness) I guess), I skipped _week 1, day 5_, but only took the 2 day rest as recommended (after which I could stretch my arms just fine). I also skipped _week 2, day 3_, because of exam. On _week 2, day 4_ (today), I decided to try my max-reps. instead of what the programme recommends. I do the push-ups as recommended (on _week 1_ I did roughly 35/30/30 every day (except the rest days), on _week 2_ I do roughly 40/35/30 every day) -- I used to do push-ups even before the programme (but after breakfast, just before lunch) and could do 40 in one set without additional weight.

My week 1, day 1 results: 11/6/3/2/2 (10/5/2/2/1 proper)
My week 2, day 1 results: 10/5/3/2/2 (7/4/2/2/1 proper)
My week 2, day 4 results: 6/4/4 (5/3/2 proper)

So, as you can see I am getting progressively worse. My back and bicep muscles do not even feel that tired this week, it almost feels as a mental block (there are usually lots of people in the workout park -- my rational side knows that they would not judge my rep. numbers, but I still do not feel comfortable doing the pull-ups there).

Has anyone else been in my situation before? Does anyone have any recommendations?

As for my diet, I try to have at least 200g of some meat per day (usually chicken, pork chops or beef/pork grounded mix) for lunch with rice or potatoes.

So I have a partial right arm paralysis (paresis, technically) and basically that means that my right arm doesn't respond to many commands sent out by the brain. This has resulted in some shitty workout sessions.

Just to explain the extent of it:

Try doing a pull up and right in the middle of it, your right arm won't listen and won't pull up further. It's always at the same exact spot so you have two options: cry in a corner, or bulk up your left arm to get over that ""dead spot"". 

In other cases, I can't lift my arm straight up (even without a weight) so trying to get two weights and lift them straight up is impossible.

Anyways, I used to work out daily at the gym but the problem was the unevenness of the work out. Basically work out machines allowed me to push ""forward"" instead of ""up"" to pull a weight up (hope that makes sense).

So I was wondering what kind of routine you would suggest or if you ever deal with anything like that? 

P.S. The scary part is that if I don't work out routinely, my arm automatically twists, degrades in muscle, sensitivity, and puts a strain on my back and spine.

I stopped doing weight watchers because I started nursing school and I was trying to simplify things to focus on school. This summer my weight creeped up to 302. I had a bit of a freakout being over 300 pounds again so I started looking to change. I started counting calories a little over a week ago and I'm down to 297. 

Somewhere in the mix I was given a weight set and started attempting to lift weights. Mainly because I 1.) often work with BIG patients that need to be moved and I want be strong enough that I won't injure myself or the patients and 2.) weight loss has given me grandma underarms. I was to tone my arms a bit to combat this.

Bench pressing hurt my shoulders, a lot of the movements didn't feel natural/I probably wasn't doing them right and it felt like a recipe for injury. So I gave away the weight set and started researching alternatives. I read through convict conditioning this week and I like that it starts out simple and advances gradually.

I think I can do this. 

Except tonight I tried doing shoulderstand squats and I couldn't even get up on my shoulders let alone hold myself in that position. So I tried jackknife squats and did reasonably okay with them (Did 4 x 10 trying to figure out where to center my weight. It was a little awkward but my knees don't hurt like when I do regular bodyweight squats.)

So a few questions:

-Is there an alternative to shoulderstand squats I can do before jackknife squats or should I start there? 
-When doing jackknife squats I assume your knees shouldn't cross your toes just like regular squats? Just how much of your body weight do you rest on your arms (10%? 25%?) and do you maintain that or do you lean forward before you push up again? It seemed that by the time I got squated down I didn't have any weight on my arms at all. Just want to make sure I'm doing this right! 
-Any suggestions for bodyweight exercises that I can do in my spare time to work on my triceps?

As I wrote this post, I realized that there's a lot more to bodyweight power training than a single workout or a few exercises. I've started work on an ebook to cover everything, but it will predictably take time to be of the quality I would like.

But there have been some vert jump and power questions recently and I said I'd post a workout, so I want to do that. Before we get to that, there are a few general things you need to know. First, ""power"" as we know it is essentially a coordination of the force generated by elastic tendon contraction (which can be trained just like muscular) and muscular contraction. The secret to good power generation is all about biomechanics and coordinating these two types of contraction. I'll explain a bit more with the exercises.

Second, squatting is a proven way to increase vertical jump capacity, and the Olympic lifts are the kings of power as far as weightlifting is concerned. These are all excellent exercises, and if you have access to them, I would highly recommend doing them, even if only for a few mesocycles a year.

And third, plyometrics are very hard on the CNS and connective tissue. You may not realize it at first, but they should have low reps for good reason. If you are properly executing them, you should need significant rest between workouts. Proper form is far more important than insane amounts of reps or any type of interval training, so rest as if you were weight training (about 2-4 minutes between sets). Try to limit this type of workout to twice a week to allow your CNS and connective tissue to recover. Also, these exercises were chosen for simplicity and are geared for a beginner. More advanced trainees can try other things like squat-jumps, 40-yard dashes, broad jumps, and skipping for distance.


**Warmup**

Any sort of plyometric exercise requires significant warmup for both the muscles and the tendons. Note that everything is done at ""warmup pace."" You don't want to blow yourself out on the high knees or squats or anything. My typical warmup is something like:

25 half-jacks

25 jumping jacks

50 high knees (25 per leg)

50 heels-to-rump (running in place kicking yourself in the butt)

20 bodyweight squats

2-3 minutes jump rope (if you can do 50 rope jumps in a row, start trying to do double-unders)


**Beginner Power Workout**

*Bunny hops*

These are mostly skill and proprioception work. It doesn't seem like it, but they are. Your goal is to use very little muscular energy to propel yourself forward. To do this, you stand with your feet wider than shoulder width at a slight outward angle. Then squat down as low as you can until you feel tightness in your hips and glutes. Experienced weightlifters will recognize this as similar to the bottom of a squat but lower because you allow your posterior chain to relax somewhat. You should be able to stay in this position for a long time if you are properly using tendon elasticity rather than muscular contraction to hold the position. Once you're comfortable there, you should start making short rocking hops forward. You should land each hop on your heels and roll onto your toes, which should provide enough momentum to rotate your entire lower body using your abs so that you can land on your heels again. This exercise is primarily to practice and learn proper tendon loading in your hips and knees as well as lower leg weight transfer when jumping from standing (i.e., coming up on your toes), not exhaust your muscles. In doing so, it also strengthens your connective tissue. You can identify what muscles you're using to ""cheat"" if they are burning by the end of your sets.

3x15


*Depth jumps*

These help teach the biomechanics of proper loading from a standing position and also strengthen the connective tissue. They also teach proper timing for muscular contraction. Essentially, you hop down from a box or step 4-8 inches high and then immediately jump as high as you can. You should go from the box to the ground and then land your jump on the ground as well. Note that you should land on the balls of your toes first, not your heels. The muscular contraction required to absorb the shock and reverse direction is almost the optimal muscle loading to maximize jump height from standing. The added ballistic stress of the initial fall also helps train tendon elasticity. Take a moment at the top before every rep and after every rep, step back onto the box, don't hop back onto it.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKtSJc39QNc) is a good video to describe the concept.

3x5


*Burpees*

Everyone loves burpees, right? In any case, your goal with these is the final jump. Jump as high as you can, but try to keep it one motion. Coming out of the squat, you should be sure to initiate the motion with hip drive first and then use the lower leg. The burpee does a lot of other stuff besides just the vertical jump, but it helps train both the stepping vert jump and the standing vert jump. It also builds the foundational body mechanics for more advanced power motions (horizontal extension and body rotation in the anterior-posterior plane).

3x10


**Conclusion**

That should be enough to get your started. If anything, after a few weeks of training, you can add sets to the depth jumps. I usually recommend adding one set every two weeks of training, but like anything, if you are more experienced with this type of workout or are an athlete, you can add a set every week. Keep in mind though that connective tissue and CNS stress are far more insidious that muscle soreness, and you may not realize how much recovery you need. Better to err on the side of slow progress than get injured. Once you hit 5x5 depth jumps, try dropping back to 3x5 depth jumps and adding 3x5 squat jumps. Then add one set to both every 2 weeks. By the end of a few months of the program, you should be at 5x5 depth jumps and 5x5 squat jumps. At that point, you should be seeing significant gains in your vertical jump capacity.",,False,,t5_2tf0a,True,,,True,t3_rst2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/rst2c/starting_power_vert_jump_training/,

50 pull ups

50 burpees (jump with hands raised to push up)

50 hanging leg lifts (differing grip positions, bring toes up to bar keeping legs straight.)


5 sets of 21's with / dumbbells (21's = 7 lower half curls, 7 upper, and 7 full curls. Alternate hammer grip and regular)

Handstand to fail 3X

In a more general case is: if I have a real tight muscle and I stretch it out before working it out, will working it cause it to become tighter? Or is the only way to make the tight muscle less tight is to stretch it and strengthen the opposite muscle (i.e. hip extensors)?

Why?,HolyCowly,33,7,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1d11yz/rapidly_lose_strength_between_chinups_why/,"I've been failing to increase my chin-up reps for quite some time. I tried adding weight but I'm not sure if I'm ready yet to do so. A lot of programs recommend going above 10 reps (greyskull even says 15) before you try adding weight. I haven't seen an explanation yet, but I figure it has to do with form, because I feel mine breaking down even though I reach 5 reps with 10 lbs added weight.

I think the main reason why I can't increase my reps is because I can't keep a consistent amount of reps. I think I even lost strength as I remember beeing able to reach 8 reps even on the third set (though I had a one month break inbetween).

I stopped adding weight to try to fix the problem and the last few workouts my goal was 3x8 (again). I don't go to failure on my first set, yet my reps go down to about 4-5 on every other set and I actually have to go to failure to reach them on my last set.

I don't have such a problem with any other exercises and now I'm not sure how to proceed.

I do them 3 times a week and I only hit my back every other workout with dumbbell bent-over rows (I don't feel them decreasing my chin-up strength). I usually don't hit biceps and if I have the desire I do them after the chin-ups.

Sorry.

I recently began exercising on a whim, and discovered that I feel about 100x better now. Most significantly is my mood, as I now realize I was suffering from depression, but physically I feel much better as well. To continue to fight my depression, I want to work out every day, but the FAQ says novice and beginners should only do 3x a week. Another thread said that, as a novice, the exercises are too taxing on the body to do every day, and that at least a 1 day recovery period is optimal. I accidentally discovered the truth of this after over doing it on handstand practice, and now my forearms hurt after I put pressure on them.

For reference my goals are:
#1 - feel good. Exercising has helped me with depression and feel more energetic. I don't want to stop even for a day, if I dont have to.
#2 - get stronger. I've never been physically strong in my life, and I've decided that developing some strength will be pretty nice. Actual strength is more important to me than looking sexy.
#3 - look sexy. After I gain some muscle, I plan to cut back on calories and lose the extra fat. This is a longer term goal, as getting stronger is more important to me.

My stats are: age 27, weight about 220, height 5'11"".

Routine has been previously: even days- hand stand practice, push ups, tricep dips. Odd days- handstand practice, l sit practice, squats.

I hadnt been doing the warmup or mobility exercises, as (being an idiot) I
Didn't think they were really important. Now, again, my forearms hurt once I take pressure off them.

The routine I'm planning will probably be:
Odd days: warmup from the FAQ and jumping jacks, handstand practice, l sit practice, support practice, push ups, incline rows, dips, assisted pull ups, squats
Even days: warm up, mobility, some form of cardio (likely jumping jacks or jump rope).

I will be taking it really easy on the arms until the pain goes away.

Especially when breaking them into smaller sets isn't an option because you need more reps to challenge yourself but can't quite progress to an advanced version of the same exercise.

Also, how does hypertrophy apply to this as well?

I am unable to do l-site or the like, and am working on my diet. 

Bodyweight squats – 8-10 reps

Push-ups (or knee-push ups) – 5-8 reps

Plank – hold for 15 seconds

Jumping Jacks – 15 reps

Bodyweight Reverse Lunges – 6 reps per leg

Lying Hip Raise (double or single leg) – 10 reps

Perform exercises 1-6 in order, resting 30 seconds between each. This is one circuit. Perform a total of 4 circuits, resting 90 seconds between each. This workout should take you approximately 15 minutes. (Taken from the Arnold website)

Someone said that you should only try it if you're very active, working out a *lot*. Is this true?

This is from wikipedia: 

&gt;A 2011 ranking by U.S. News &amp; World Report, involving a panel of 22 experts, ranked the Paleo diet lowest of the 20 diets evaluated based on factors including health, weight-loss and ease of following.[26] These results were repeated in the 2012 survey, in which the diet tied with the Dukan diet for the lowest ranking out of 25 diets; U.S. News &amp; World Report stated that their experts ""took issue with the diet on every measure"".[26] However, one expert involved in the ranking stated that a ""true Paleo diet might be a great option: very lean, pure meats, lots of wild plants. The modern approximations… are far from it.""[26] He added that ""duplicating such a regimen in modern times would be difficult.""[26

But this is the next paragraph:

&gt;The U.S. News ranking assumed a low-carb version of the paleo diet, specifically containing only 23% carbohydrates.[27] Higher carbohydrate versions of the paleo diet, which allow for significant consumption of root vegetables,[28] were not a part of this ranking.[26] Dr. Loren Cordain, a proponent of a low-carbohydrate Paleolithic diet, responded to the U.S. News ranking, stating that their ""conclusions are erroneous and misleading"" and pointing out that ""five studies, four since 2007, have experimentally tested contemporary versions of ancestral human diets and have found them to be superior to Mediterranean diets, diabetic diets and typical western diets in regards to weight loss, cardiovascular disease risk factors and risk factors for type 2 diabetes.""[29][30] The editors of the U.S. News ranking replied that they had reviewed the five studies and found them to be ""small and short, making strong conclusions difficult"".[31]

I'm going to make sub-threads for the following things for now (please add something if you feel it warrants a list):  pullup bars, parallettes, gymnastic rings, and weight vest/belts.  We could even have a thread for things like quality jump ropes or whatever other stuff you use as part of your bodyweight routine.  Some people may want to make a section for medicine balls or whatever else they feel might fit under the realm of 'bodyweight' exercises, but I don't know where we should draw the line at 'bodyweight'; I'll leave that up to up/down votes.  I'm not even sure if the weight vest/belt section makes sense, but if people use belts for pullups or vests for pushups, I'd love to see the various types out there and feedback on them.

So here goes:

* Buy at least 4 meters of around 38mm polyester webbing (best to get this from an outdoor store that sells climbing gear since it's usually gonna be cheaper this way but if not you can get it online easy enough, and you would do fine with 2 metres for just pull ups but you need more for dips).
* Cut in half, melt ends to stop fraying.
* Tie a knot near one end of each length using a rag or stray material to make sure the knot is very thick (see pics below).
* Open your door, thread the knot end of each one over the top door about shoulder width apart.
* Close your door over the webbing and pull each length firmly to make sure secure.
* Do a couple of test pulls on each one with your whole body weight, gradually and carefully to make sure they are secure and that your door doesn't look like it will break.
* If your a soft cunt get some towel or fabric or something soft to wrap around your hands for grip, otherwise just expect sore hands and deal with it.

This was my solution for not having a doorframe that I can put a pull up bar in and not having anywhere nearby to do pullups, works great for me.

I also find this better than a pull up bar for for leg lifts since it has the same kind of feeling as wall bars.


For rows I tie mine end-to-end and just have a stick I found ages ago tied in the second length.


If you're into BJJ, tie each one around a corner of your Gi top and you have perfect grip trainers.

Final Note: In saying all of this though it is a great and portable, good for hotel lifestyle or cheap bedsit flats.

Also, goals that you can set with BW fitness are different than say setting a bench or squat goal (V-Sit/Manna vs. 500 lb squat, etc.)

It seems that it's universally agreed on that barbell work for your legs is the way to go - especially for the posterior chain muscles. So if I make the investment to get a barbell set and squat rack to be able to do all of that, wouldn't it make sense to do a full body workout with the barbell too? I have dumbbells from workouts past, but having a barbell would allow even more - bench, rows, sh. press, clean/jerk, etc.

**Disclaimer: I have spoken to a physio/doctor/hospital/etc - all of whom say ""try things and see how you get on""...**

Hi folks,

About 6 months ago I had spinal fusion for scoliosis. A week in hospital, two titanium rods, and 18 titanium screws later, and I had a straight spine! Wahey!

I have been back to work full time for about 4 months now and I can manage pretty much everything day-to-day. My job is at a computer most of the day, so I don't need to do any heavy lifting or much movement. **Now, I'm looking to get fit and build a body I can be proud of, spurred on by my general inactivity over the past few months.**. 

Here's what I can (very) comfortably manage at the moment:

- Walking to and from work, carrying a bag, etc (4 mile round trip!)
- Go out with friends clubbing/dancing for most of the night
- Swimming confidently at a good speed (although breast stroke is a little tricky)
- About 20 pressups confidently, and a further 10 struggling somewhat

I asked the doctors and they have advised that after about 3 months, I should be able to return to things like gentle running, cycling, swimming, etc. I'm now at 6 months in and they didn't have any further advice - ""play it by ear"" - which isn't much help!

All I know right now is that I am quite slim and have virtually no muscle (body fat approx 15%). I'm looking to both build more muscle, and be more active. 

**I would like to avoid heavy lifting that requires support from your back, just in case**. However, **I'm comfortable doing bodyweight exercises**, provided they don't need my spine to bend too much.

I know that Insanity burns a lot of fat combined with diet. With a 2300 Calorie diet, I was thinking of using this Insanity and strength combo workout I've setup. Is this reasonable for achieving my goals? My main concern is that doing all of this cardio will inhibit strength gains. It's mainly push ups, but since theres a lot of leg work in Insanity I figured I wouldn't have to add any.

I'm in my second week of Insanity, but when it comes to strength, I'm a beginner, and I could really use some input. I also posted to this subreddit is because I don't really have the means to buy any equipment. What I have is pull-up bar and a 20 lb dumbbell.

I saw the ropes online that come with the end already on them, but they were significantly more money than this one.  I got the rope at knotandrope.com for $1.59 a foot.  I thought that a 12 foot rope might be short, so I measured to a branch I had and decided to go with 25 feet of rope.  After the first few climbs, I think that the height might have been a bit ambitious - hopefully once I am better at doing it I will be able to take advantage of the full height of the rope.

Anyway, in case anyone wanted to see what I did here are the steps I took to make it.  Let me know if you have any questions.


First I tied the end of the rope so it wouldn't unravel (and it is also an extra safety measure so the bolts that I use won't slip out)

http://i.imgur.com/OIMCq.jpg

Next I cut a length of pipe, drilled holes through it, and then cut it in half the long way.  This will be the ""clamp"" on the rope.  For my 1.5"" rope I used a 1.25"" pvc pipe

http://i.imgur.com/ZmlEQ.jpg

Here you can see that I weaved a piece of chain into the clamp (and put the bolts through the chain)

http://i.imgur.com/iD1YY.jpg

Then I put a hose clamp around the bottom, again, just as an extra safety measure.  

http://i.imgur.com/klUqw.jpg

Here is the finished product.  Note that I also added another hose clamp at the top for a backup safety measure.

Here's a couple pics of how it looks hanging in my yard.

In this one you can see where I put in a knot - I quickly noticed that by time i climbed up I was too tired to climb down so I needed somewhere to stop to rest.  The knot is perfect for that.

I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1g4tfk/forearm_pain/) post a week ago regarding my forearm pain preventing me to haveing a good grip. Mainly it happened after a few weeks where I probably exceeded on pulling work (Armstrong workout + climbing).
Most of you suggested me to take a rest week and I did. I continued to workout but only on lower body, sprinting, and never using forearms.

Now that 10 days have passed, although it's a bit healed, I am still having this bad sensation in my forearms. Since the pain is almost non-existent when I don't workout or press on the forearm (even then it's not really pain but like the forearm feeling 'tired'), I feel that a doctor is not really necessary yet.

That's why I'm asking you for advice on what this could be. Basically I feel 'pain' if I cross-friction these parts:

*  the inner forearm near the middle
*  the outer forearm near the elbow and the wrist

The effect is that I cannot maintain a good grip for long but feel the forearms sore after just a bit.

Is this some kind of tendonitis? Are these muscles? What do you recommend doing, given that 10 days of rest have not worked out?

Anyway I lost the two pack, I ate junk food one weekend.  Didn't realize it doesn't take much to lose your progress.  I also stopped training for a few weeks, plus I kept doing the same exercises.  

Fast forward to Early March I bought some rings.   Started to do pull ups on rings.

Here are my pics.  I don't think I eat enough.  I really need to eat more.  I mainly eat Chicken, Fruit, Veges, Roast Beef, Fish. I stay away from Fast Food, Chips, Lollies, Soft drinks, Chocolate



Here are my pics.

I train 3 times a week.

first and foremost I'm no scientist. This is all observational from my time as a collegiate athelete and recent experiences with body weight fitness. I highly encourage discussion rather than authoritative hollerings. 

If you're reading this I highly doubt that you will ever reach your absolute potential. Why is this, you might ask? **no one** ever reaches their full potential. Your idol in what ever sport that you follow religiously- is not the best they could be- or at least that's the mindset that **they** hold. This is the mindset which has gotten them to where they are and where they are going. So then how can this simple mindset improve your performance? Well let's think about this hypothetically. Suppose there is someone with a meticulous training log- always in the gym on their regular schedule, always progressing, always doing exactly what the pros do. He's seeing VAST improvement. Unfortunately the one book he read never covered stretching, eating right or taking rest. He will burn out, get injured, etc. 

What is the take away from this?

Look at your strengths, sure. But look deeper and find your weaknesses. For me, I know flexibility is my weakpoint. My hips are tight, as well as my lower back. I see gains, but the real bottle neck of improvement in functional movement (for parkour, calistenics, etc.) is my lack of flexibility.

Should I pattern my routine so that I knock out one exercise before moving onto the next? IE: 3 sets of Pull ups before moving on to Horizontal Pushes. Or should I run through the entire routine once, and start over, repeat?

Good place to buy some bands for pull ups? (I know the marines use them, you throw them over the bar and put your knee through them so they help pull you up.)

Critique please!",TimBobDAnimal,35,10,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1bo7nl/strength_training_for_5_months_looking_to_round/,"I'm a 6'1, 180 pound male. My goal is to establish a sustainable, life long commitment to exercise for the sake of my health and well being. I want to increase my strength, endurance, flexibility and cardio evenly, within the comfort of my own room, without much equipment. 

I've been exclusively strength and flexibility training since October to overcome a serious drop in weight over the summer (165!). My old routine was strictly pushups, pull ups, dips, planks, bridges, body-weight squats, calf raises. I did each exercise 2 times a week. I used whatever progression I needed to make the sets only 3-8 reps. 

Now that I'm back to my old weight (and stronger than ever!) I want to diversify my routine to include endurance and cardio to round out the routine. I've picked up some weights to give me better options for my legs and lower back. I'm planning on a 4 day split. I'm thinking my new routine should look like this;

Day 1; Planks (Classic, Side, one legged, one armed; total 7 planks)

Day 2; Push ups (5x5), Pull ups (5x5), Dips (5x5)

Day 3; Weighted Pistols (5x5), One Legged Deadlift (5x5)

Day 4; Squats and Pushups circuit. 30 minutes; moderate to intense


I stretch after every workout and before I sleep. I do calf raises every day, whenever I find myself just standing around. 

My pushups are currently on Archers, working towards One Armed.

My pull ups/dips are lacking, but I blame the fact I'm using a sturdy door instead of a proper equipment. I'm working towards my ultimate goal of muscle ups. I realize I can't really do them until I get a proper bar. 

My planks are around 0:45m to 1:30m in length, depending on the variation. 

I recently got to pistols, thus the desire to start adding weight.

I'm adding deadlifts because I feel its the only way to properly work my back. Doing them one legged means I can use less weights. I'm planning on starting low and working my way up. 

I feel a pushup/squat circuit will best fit my goals for cardio and endurance, as they are movements I do regularly and the circuit training seems to meld the two goals together well. 

Diet wise, I'm bulking until 200 pounds. I've been solid in this regard.

I'm trying to put together a ""fitness challenge"" for a forum I'm a part of. Kind of like the ""biggest loser"" challenges people do, but for general strength/fitness instead of weight (which is a poor indicator of fitness, IMO).

Scoring will be improvement-based, rather than absolute, so we'll reward effort at any fitness level.

Unfortunately, I don't really have much of an idea on how to set up the scoring.

So far, the exercises I'm thinking of including are fairly simple:

* Running (sprint or endurance. Not sure yet)
* Push-ups (maybe burpees instead)
* Pullups
* Plank

My first thought was to come up with a way to score each one that would kind of balance all of them out, so if someone's not good at, say, pullups, they could focus more on running and still be competitive.

Unfortunately, that seems rather complicated.

Now, I'm thinking maybe just outlining a list of exercises (WOD-style), and scoring based on the total time to complete the full set. A participant's score at the end would be their final time vs their original time. 

Any thoughts/suggestions on scoring, exercises, etc.?
