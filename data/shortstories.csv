The first part was written in response to an AskReddit post, and the second was written by request.  It's part of an ongoing series.

The AskReddit question was ""You wake up one morning and everyone on earth is gone. Nothing on the TV or the radio and the internet is out. You become convinced that there is no one left on earth.

The Longest Week (Part One)

Day One

Think of all the people I'll never fuck. Think of all the people who will never fuck me over. Read. Drink. Read some more. Think about the fact that there are no other people to write new books, and even if there were, there would likely be no people to publish them. Drink heavily. Think about the fact that I am possibly technically the best writer in the world. Drink to that. Hold up my empty bottle. Smile, realizing alcohol is now free. Put the bottle in the blue bin. Consider how pointless said blue bin is. Open window, look around, throw empty bottle at...something. Close window. Open window. Unlock all doors. Open all doors. Think about animals, people going from there to not-there, and how, even in an empty room, you can feel eyes on you. Especially in an empty room. Think about how the whole world is now essentially one giant empty room. Shudder. Close windows. Close doors as quietly as possible. Lock doors. Lock windows. Push furniture in front of doors. Shake my head and laugh a little. Cry. Open another bottle. Notice the clearing left on the floor now that all the furniture has been moved. Move pillows and blanket onto the floor. Put bottle away. Try to get to sleep. Get up. Go to look out window through blinds. Try to decide what would be worse: seeing the now-familiar nothing that was there when I threw the bottle, or seeing something. Decide against looking out window. Pull out fine china and cups and stack them in front of all entrances. Think about how ridiculous my house now looks with furniture blocking the doors and dishes everywhere. Carry pillows and blankets upstairs, along with a knife from the kitchen. Put knife under pillow. Realize how hilarious it would be if I thrashed around while sleeping and accidently slit my wrists. Put knife on nightstand instead. Lie in bed. Think about how little I actually know about first aid. Think about all the people who have been in the bed with me and are now simply -nowhere-. Try not to cry. Cry. Move bedstuffs into closet, along with knives and an electric lantern. Decide I'll turn the light off soon. Listen. Listen. Listen. Hear nothing. Fall asleep. Dream of everyone who is now not-there, all watching me. All silent. Waiting for... something. Wake up with a scream. Think about how loud that scream was. Listen. Listen. Hold the knife tightly. Listen. Put the knife down. Pull a blanket over myself.

Day Two

Wake up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Longest Week (Part Two)

Day Two

Wake up.  Open eyes.  See...nothing.  Panic.  Open closet door.  Breathe.  Try to remember turning off electric lantern.  Pick up lantern.  Notice switch is set to ""On"".  Think about how few batteries are left, and where they might be.  Search closet for batteries.  Put the knives in my back pocket.  Try to ignore the box in the corner.  Think about how few photos of her I have, and how I'll never hear her laugh again.  Try not to cry.  Laugh instead.  Realize how empty that laughter sounds.  Shudder.  Find a bottle.  Drink.  Crack the blinds to let more light in.  Sit on the bed.  Think about how the only laughter I'll ever hear from this point on will be my own.  Drink heavily.  Leave the empty bottle on the bed and go downstairs.  Look for something to eat.  Settle on noodles.  Think about how loud the crunching is as I chew.  Swallow.  Cough.  Look for something to wash it down.  Finish off the last of the flat soda.  Sit down in the middle of the room.  Look at the furniture and stacked china.  Run my fingers through my hair, and think about how long I might be able to make this food last.  Feel the familiar pain of hunger.  Ignore it.  Read. 

Empty out drawers looking for batteries.  Rummage through *junk* looking for something useful.  Think about how much trash a person accumulates while they live, and how almost all of it outlives them.  Set aside things like lighters, duct tape, and books.  Realize I never looked in the nightstand.  Go upstairs and look in the nightstand.  Find new batteries.  Rip them out of the packaging.  Put them in the lantern.  Notice the lantern still doesn't work.  Make sure I put them in the right way.  Still nothing.  Curse.  Look out the window and try to determine how much light I have left. Notice as clouds block the sun and the light turns weak and sickly.  Think about how dark the world gets without electric light.  No street lights, no headlights, no dim glow of television sets through windows.  Think about being all alone in that darkness.  Look at my neighbor's house.  Gather up all the odds and ends I've set aside in a bag.  Put the remainder of my food in that bag.  Carefully move the china and furniture away from the front door.  Unlock the front door.  Reach for the doorknob.  Hesitate.  Lock the front door.  Sit on the floor and think.  

Leave the bag on the floor.  Get another bag and go around the house collecting the bottles that aren't empty.  Set that bag next to the first one.  Stare at the door.  Think of all the empty houses, and how every house in the world will be empty the moment I cross that threshold.  Think of all the people who used to live in those houses.  Feel... cold.  Fight the feeling that I'm being watched.  Go upstairs, and open the box in the closet for the first time in what feels like years.  Take out the pictures.  Hold them by the edges, carefully, and look at her.  Remember.  Remember.  Put the pictures in my pocket, walk downstairs, and pick up the bags.  Look around at my house and notice how little it looks like a home.  Unlock the front door.  Put my hand on the doorknob, feeling the cool metal.  Think about miles and miles and miles of emptiness.  Turn the knob a fraction of an inch.  Realize I'm sweating.  Realize my hand is shaking.  Take a deep breath.  Let out a short scream as THUNDER CRASHES and the house shakes.  Breathe.  Listen to the first drops of rain turn into a downpour that drowns out the silence.  Smile.  Open the door.

When you hear something like that, you prepare yourself for the inevitable moral conclusion that will come at the end of the story.  You settle in to your comfortable chair, and you begin to wait patiently for the praiseworthy denouement. 

Well, let’s hear some truth.

I met an old man dying on a train. He didn’t say much of anything when I sat down across from him. Maybe he made an odd noise that old people are prone to make, I honestly wasn’t paying much attention.  

The room was hot and stuffy - and normally I’m alright with a little bit of heat and humidity - but for once - I noticed.

I noticed the way his breathing was labored, shallow on the inhale and weezy on the exhale.  I noticed the way sweat collected around the sides of his neck, tracing beady lines down his deathly pale, wrinkly, blotched skin. 

I noticed when he closed his eyes, he dreamed of being young again.  How when he closed his eyes, our roles were reversed and he was staring at me in my debilitated condition, silently judging my existence as a matter of my condition. 

The train came to a screeching halt.  I would say I smelled burning rubber - but that’s impossible because trains don’t work like that.  I smelled my own mortality, right then, I think.

1350672138.0,28,self.shortstories,11re5c,"Like many others, I delude myself into thinking I'll one day be an author. Here is some flash fiction: ""Drinking Alone""",MrMofo,34,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/11re5c/like_many_others_i_delude_myself_into_thinking/,"I don't usually drink alone in bars, but the idea seemed great. Ever since she left, the urge was steadily building. Nothing else I did felt like a proper ending. She lingered. So one night I  went out, alone, to a bar, aiming at becoming the idea. I sat and ordered my drink. The experience was nothing like the idea. Quietly wasting away, the first twenty minutes or so were horrendous. Then he sat down- at least I think he did. I don't remember, maybe he was already there. I do remember the first thing he said: ""How's your beer?"" My beer was excellent- I had become an expert on my beer. Sit alone for twenty minutes (or more?) sipping your beer, and you will be quite primed to describe said beer. So I did. And he listened. It was not a very interesting description.

That's how we got to talking. We talked about where we were, the bar itself, and we talked about our beers. We joked about the news, and the weather, then exchanged tiny best-of's we'd gathered from our lives. Best jokes heard, best one-liners, best pranks. Best tricks, best stories. We shared and drank some more, and we never asked the other his name. We didn't talk about what we did, or who we were. We talked about what we thought. There is a difference. The night was long, and in a way it was tiring. It was also a release. Hours later, as the sun started to rise, I thought it prudent to finally get my friend's name. Which is when he suddenly plopped down his final glass, and as if reading my mind, said ""No need for names."" We'd gotten into sync with one another. Hours of intense conversation will do that. Then he stretched, got up, and put on his hat. He said something to me then, and I don't think I'll forget it. He said, ""You know something? I'm not what a lot of people would consider successful, but I love Time. Time and death. I love time, because it means even someone like me is a traveler."" He paused to throw on his scarf.

Then he continued, ""You know, I had a physics teacher once, and he explained how space and time are cut from the same cloth- fact, they are the same cloth. You and me, we sat here, and we drank, and we talked, and the whole time we traveled. Time keeps you moving, even when it seems like you aren't."" He put on his jacket. 

I asked him, ""And death?""

He stopped, his hands in his sleeves, and said ""Death is always the end of the line. So it 's the journey that matters. Without death, we'd think the destination was the point."" That was the last thing he said to me.

I said ""goodbye"" to him, and as was my habit, ""good luck."" too. Then I went home and slept, and maybe dreamed, perhaps about how far I'd come from who I'd been.

But before that, there was noise. Explosions and screams and cries for help that were never answered. Grating metal screeches as corporate buildings fell, collapsing under the weight of their own lies. Children of children killing children.

Yet, remarkably the sun still came up the next morning and shone down over the cold metallic remains. No cries. No screams. No breaking glass. Just silence and sun and an iron-like tang at the back of the throat. You would be forgiven for thinking that this happened in a different place, at a different time. It didn't.
And that's when I awoke.
""Hello?"" I heard you call.

""Hello!"" 

""Where are you?"" The voice was faint, thready.

""I'm here!"" I began to search.

""No."" A belligerent statement of fact. ""No, I'm here. I'd see you if you were too. Don't you know where you are?""

But we found each other, eventually. Together, we took off our clothes, and walked 'round our little town. We tore the paper from the walls, the carpet from the floor. We burnt those framed photographs and ripped out the wires. We returned all that oil to far underground, where it belonged. We took it all down, every building, brick by brick, until only scrub-covered ground remained.

And then we sat, and compared notes on what it means to exist. And in a thousand years time when the aliens finally discover this lonely blue dot, they'll see us and they'll know that you and I, we didn't destroy ourselves. Or they won't, because we will be gone.

Her visits have gotten more and more infrequent as time passes. Before this past night it had been 6 days, 13 hours, and 42 minutes since our last encounter.

I was drunk. I spend most of my time in an alcohol-induced stupor these days. A fist smashed my door several times, yanking me from my whiskey nirvana. After a brief but brutal fight with gravity and the floor, I managed to navigate my way to the knocking sound. But I was cautious. It could have been another one of my ""friends"" claiming they were there to help me. I'm too smart for them. All they want to do is strip away my life-preserving elixir, the one thing getting me through every morning and every night. My mud brown orbs peep through the eye-hole and meet a pair of Caribbean blue eyes. Her eyes. 

It's hard for me to recollect what happened next but I remember flinging open the door with such force it's a mystery the hinges didn't come undone. Then she's in my arms, bringing me warmth greater than Hell but everything in this moment is so perfect that I know we must be in a place even higher than Heaven. 

Strawberries. That's what her hair smells like. I had almost forgotten. Immediately I curse my memory and fight back tears of frustration. But before I have the chance to cry, she leans in and whispers, ""I miss you, darling"" and I melt into a sweet, steaming pile of yearning. Our eyes meld into a navy black mess. I hate my own eyes for dirtying the beauty of this union.

That old, tangled knot in my chest returns. It slowly expands and I know it's going to explode soon so I go for the only cure I know. My lips seek the warmth of her lips. Instead they meet a finger, stiff and icy. She shakes her head, wearing the same kind of smile a mother does when her three year old son asks for the meaning behind ""you'll be a big brother soon"". 

The rest of the night was a blur of love. Hours dripped into hours. At some point the alcohol and strawberries took their toll. She didn't visit my dreams that night and when I awoke to the light of the morning she was gone. The knot in my chest unwound and sunk back into its bottomless void. I poured myself a glass of whiskey and stared out at the blindingly bright sun. Though it stung, it helped bring back a bit of glowing comfort. 

I finished my drink and grabbed my car keys. For once I actually had a destination in mind. The drive was uneventful. The sun hid behind a shield of clouds and did not return for the rest of the day. On the way there I stopped at a farmer's market and picked up a bouquet of forget-me-nots. They had been her favorite flowers. 

I placed the forget-me-nots on the cold stone and stared at nothing for three hours in somber silence. Then I drove home, opened a new bottle of Jack Daniels, and drank myself into another coma. As I drifted into death I promised to spend tomorrow the same way. And the day after that. And the day after that. And that was how my life would be spent from now. I don't need anything or anyone other than my alcohol and the occasional visit from her. Maybe if I take one more shot than I did the night before I can see her again. And maybe next time she won't leave once the sun rises. And maybe we'll be together forever, like those two stupidly innocent children promised each other underneath the thousand year old oak tree in that field of gold forever ago. Maybe.

I don’t have much time left. How old am I, 32? Haven’t even been on this planet for half a century, but oh well, I’ve had a good time. Sure I’ve had some ups and downs, I got lost somewhere along the way, but I like to think that in the end, I found my path. I found my so called, “calling”. Since I was born, I always thought I could make a difference, change the world, make it a better place. Injustice, prejudice, suffering; they were all my main enemies back in the day, when I was still a kid, who thought he knew so much about the world. Yet he knew nothing at all. Or maybe he did. Who knows. Only *God* can tell.

Now I’m sitting here on this lonely bench, in front of a beautiful, endless lake. Shit, I never realized how pretty this lake was. It’s *so*… peaceful; so goddamn, numbingly peaceful. The surface of the water is flat, no ripples, no waves, no movement whatsoever. It’s like time just stopped for the lake. It doesn’t care that the world, well, at least *my* world, is about to end. Hell, why would it care? It is made up of the ambassador of life itself, why would it bother with the conflicts of a race of petty, mysteriously wonderful creatures?
There’s a little duckling just a few meters away from me. A small, helpless duckling. Isn’t it ironic how nature itself can create such contrasting scenarios? Before my eyes, there is a colossal mushroom in the sky. The explosion happened about a minute ago I think. Clouds of fumes are rising to the sky, eating it up so neatly, so that not even the Gods can witness the catastrophe. At the center of it, a blinding light is exponentially expanding outwards, eager to consume everything it finds in its path. A fire is raging towards me, towards my town, towards the world. Yet, just in front of me, there’s a cute, stranded duckling. Can you see the irony? I can definitely see it, but hey, I’m the one who’s about to be blown to bits, not you, so what the hell should I know?

Nature blessed our planet and cherished it and nourished it and gave it life. We were the ultimate byproducts of this mind-blowingly long process. But we decided to fuck it all up and just spit in nature’s face. Hey, we’re goddamn humans, so fuck you nature! We don’t need you! And that’s why I’m here. That’s why the world is going to be decimated. We brought this onto us, but then again, who else could’ve caused this? Aliens? Global warming? Let’s be rational. We’re a wild bunch, and I think we all knew this was bound to happen one day. We hoped it wouldn’t happen in our lifetime. Hell, I hoped it wouldn’t happen in *my* lifetime. But I digress.

I don’t have much time left. I’m just glad I’m sitting here on my lonely bench, in front of a beautifully gelatinous lake. And the duckling of course. I’m kind of sad it had to end this way. I wanted to live a bit longer you know? Grow old in a small cozy cottage on top of a green hill, or in the middle of the Alps, or hell, why not in a bungalow in Polynesia? If I could’ve lived up to 100 years, probably consumed by senile dementia or Alzheimer’s, I still would’ve been pretty happy. Especially satisfied by the fact that I had lived a freakin century. Oh well. I can see the shockwave dangerously approaching me. The lake isn’t so calm anymore. It’s rising like a King Cobra, hypnotized by a snake enchanter. I can’t see the mushroom anymore, as a wall of water is racing towards me, covering my field of vision.
 
Might as well have a last cigarette. I don’t think I’ll be needing my lungs in hell anyways.

There was a young monster named Davi.  Davi was a lonely boy.  He had seven brothers, but he always stayed home alone.

Davi cried everyday.  He wanted to make friends.

Davi went to talk to his grandfather, who was the guard of the gate which connects Human World and Monster World.

Davi asked his grandfather, ""I want to go to Human World.  I don't have any friends here.  Maybe I can make friends over there.""

Grandfather said ""No, it's too dangerous.  No one in Human World likes Monsters.  You won't make any friends there.""

But Davi went ""Nobody in Monster World likes me anyway.  I want to at least try making friends in Human World!""

Grandfather decided to allow Davi three days in Human World, and gave him three gold coins, and told him ""These coins may help you when you are in trouble.""
 
Davi thanked his grandfather, and went through the gate.
  
Davi walked through the dark...

Davi landed on the street.  He was amazed at the sun, the sky, the tall trees, and the houses!

Davi saw a college dormitory in which college girls were petting a cat.

Davi sneaked into the dormitory and talked to the cat. ""Mr!"" said Davi.  ""How can I make friends with humans?""

"" Meow! "" answered Mr. Cat.  ""I am not going to tell you because you are a Monster.  We don't like monsters.  But I see you have three gold coins in your pocket.  If you give me one coin, I'll answer your question.""
  
Davi gave him one gold coin.  Then Mr. Cat went ""Ok!  All I do is mew and purr at people's feet.""
 
Davi said ""Thank you, Mr. Cat!""
 
Davi approached the college girls, who were busy chattering with each other, and purred and mewed at their feet.  The college girls turned around, and...
  
""AAARRRGGGHHH!!!  Monster!!!""  The college girls screamed in horror, and ran out of the building!
 
Davi was left alone in the dormitory.  He walked out on the street, and he cried and cried and cried all night long.

On the second day, Davi saw two young boys playing with a dog in a house.

Davi sneaked into the house, and talked to the Dog. ""Mr!"" said Davi.  ""How can I make friends with Humans?""

"" Arf!"" answers Mr. Dog.  ""I am not going to tell you because you are a monster.  We don't like monsters.  But I see you have two gold coins in your pocket.  If you give me one coin, I'll be happy to answer your question.""

So Davi gave him one coin.  Then Mr. Dog went ""Okay!  All I do is bow-wow, and lick people's faces.""  ""Thank you, Mr. Dog!"" said Davi.

Davi approached the two young boys, and suddenly licked their faces and BOW-WOWED!!

""AAARRRGGGHHH!!! MONSTER!!""  cried the two young boys.  They screamed in horror and ran out of the building!
 
Davi was left alone in the house.  He walked out on the street, and he cried and cried and cried all night long.
  
On the third day, Davi saw a huge house in which an old blind lady was feeding a small bird in a cage.

Davi sneaked into the house, and talked to the bird. ""Mrs!"" said Davi.  ""How can I make friends with humans?""

""Chirp!"" answered Mrs. Bird.  ""I am not going to tell you because you are a Monster.  We don't like Monsters.  But I see you have one gold coin in your pocket.  If you give me the coin, I'll be happy to answer your question.""

So Davi gave her his last gold coin.  Then Mrs. Bird says ""Okay!  All I do is chirp and sing a song!""

Davi started singing a song.  Then...
 
""Where does this come from?"" the old blind lady approached Davi.  Davi was so happy.  ""This is the most beautiful song I have ever heard,""said Old Blind Lady.  

Then she touched Davi's face.  ""Who are you? What is this?  Could this be a... AAARRRGGGHHH!!! Monster!!!!""  The Old Blind Lady screamed in horror, and fainted dead!

Davi was left alone once again.  He walked out on the street, and he cried and cried and cried all night long.

Davi went back to the gate.  He was very sad.  The trees, the sun, the sky didn't amaze Davi anymore.

Davi met his grandfather at the gate.  Grandfather went ""Why are you crying?""  Then Davi answered ""I tried really hard to make friends with humans, and asked Mr. Cat, Mr. Dog and Mrs. Bird for advise, and I followed their good advice, but nobody liked
 me.  Nobody cared about me anywhere.  I'll be alone for the rest of my life.  Nobody likes me!""
 
Then grandfather answered ""It takes so much courage just to go to Human World.  And you were on your own Davi.  You are the most courageous Monster I have ever seen.  Everytime you cried, you learned to be stronger.  You don't need anyone else.""

Davi listened to his grandfather.  ""Now go home, Davi,"" said grandfather.

Davi walked back to his house, and opened the door, then...

Davi's seven brothers rushed to him, cheering ""We've heard you were in Human World by yourself?!"" ""I wish I can be like you!""  ""You are so brave!""

His hot breath filling my canal as his coarse mustache tickled my cartilage. I leaned away from him, unsure of how to respond. I had not seen a pig's tit before and if it was anything like a woman's, I'm sure it would be a treat. But I had just met this man and his question unsettled me. I wasn't sure I wanted to look at any kind of tit with him, let alone a pig's. I proceeded cautiously.

“Are they big?” I asked him.

“The biggest.” he responded.

“And the nipples?”

“Exquisite.”

This was not going to be easy. We were locked in a mental chess match and it was clear the man was practiced. He was proud of his pig's tits and if they were anything like how he described, it would be hard to blame him. Even so, it was getting late. I simply didn't have time for this.

“Listen Mister, I'm sure your pig's tits are great, and I'd really like to look at them sometime, but I should be going.” 

He looked at me with vacant eyes, his mouth slightly ajar. I was beginning to think I had deeply offended him when suddenly, he leaned close, and unleashed his secret weapon.

“I'll. let. you. milk. them.” He said slowly, making sure I drank in every word.

He can't be serious, I thought. No self-respecting farmer would let a perfect stranger touch his animals' tits, not to mention a pig's. Yet there he was, staring at me in anticipation, panting silently, eyes wet with excitement. And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little excited too. These weren't just any ordinary tits, they were milkin' tits. The kind of tits you only hear about in stories.

As I wondered if he'd let me taste the milk, I felt a hand grip me firmly by the arm and yank me backwards.

“It's time to go Billy, didn't you hear me calling you?” Ms. Palanski began pulling me towards the school bus.

“But Ms. Palanski, the farmer said-”

“What farmer?”

I turned back only to see an empty field. The farmer had vanished.

I stayed silent while she escorted me onto the bus, my fellow classmates staring as I searched for an open seat. They have no idea, I thought. No idea how close I came to milking some tits.

The bus roared to life and slowly started down the farm's dirt driveway. I watched the barn get smaller and smaller through a cloud of dust, wondering if I'd ever come back. Wondering if the tits would still be there when I did. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,True,,,True,t3_prqed,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/prqed/pig_tit/,

Some were a deep dark purple and others were varying shades from sky to royal blue.  There were also some yellow and white ones which were only just yellow or white.

This year was unseasonably warm but the flowers didn't seem to mind.  If they were asked they would say they really enjoyed the warm weather, each others' company and the extra lifespan given that the lawn hadn't been mowed in over two months.

Batman simply stared out the window in a typical Batman-grimace way as he was unable to appreciate the pansies.  He was actually upset the lawn hadn't been mowed.  The pansies didn't mind.  The chair probably didn't mind either since it was just a chair and not pansies or Batman or any kind of flower at all.

It's not a hard job. Ring items up. Put them in a bag. When it's time to go home you turn off the lights and lock up the store. It's not much but it's a job.
	

You're not quite an adult, not quite a boy. Sure, you're legally an adult, but you don't pay bills. You're really only working at this place so you can afford to have fun when you go back to school. You have about an hour left on your shift, and you're spending it watching soap operas you can't understand and eating candy bars you haven't paid for. That's when he walks in the door.
	

This is the guy that made your childhood a living hell. He's not quite an adult, not quite an child, but he's more of an adult than you. He's the same age as you. Same grade. You haven't seen him in years, but you've heard some things. You know he got married out of high school, and was divorced soon after. You know he has a kid that he struggles to support. And just looking at him you know you're far better off than him. Finally.
	

You see this guy in front of you. The reason why you chose to walk three miles to school instead of take the bus. The reason why you faked sick so many days back in middle school, and the reason you ditched so many classes in high school. You see this guy in front of you, and you can't help but be a little happy. You can see the gap of time from when you last saw each other hasn't been kind to him. He's fat now. He looks dirty. His clothes are the same ones that he wore in high school only worn down with time. He still has hair only now it just sits in a tangled heap on top of his head. He has a beard that looks like it's there because he can't afford to shave. And even his voice sounds like it's degraded. If you hadn't known him before now you might have mistaken him for a bum wandering in the store for some alcohol. 
	

Which isn't too far off.
	

This man that made you kneel in dog shit in elementary school. This guy who used to take your lunch money. This guy who would make fun of you until you cried is walking up in down the aisles of the store. He makes his way to the alcohol section and starts combing over the different selection of beers. 
	

He's taking a while so you let your mind wander for a bit. You think of those women in those soap operas you can't understand. How you wouldn't mind having women like *that* at your school. You think about what it would be like to act on one of those shows. You think about how you used to love acting in school plays when you were younger until this homeless looking guy looking for beer in your store harassed you about it. How he'd call you a faggot or queer. How he caused you to have such bad anxiety when you tried to act that you simply couldn't do it anymore. You think of nervous you felt when he was around that he caused you to stutter. Which of course only led to more insults. 
	

This guy who used to beat the shit out of you anytime he could. This guy who told all your friends that they were losers for hanging out with you finally chooses his beer and brings it to your cash register. And of course it's one of those bad beers. Six beers for six dollars. And of course it's beer. 


Cheap beer.
 

High school beer. 


And as your ringing him up you think of how much fun you used to have at parties until he started showing up. Until he held you under his arm and poured beer over your head in front of the whole party. You think of how many parties you must have missed because of that incident. 
	

And this guy who made you the self-conscious, self-loathing wreck you are today asks for a pack of cigarettes too. Of course he wants cigarettes. And as you ring him up you can smell the quality of his life. Cigarette smoke, alcohol,  and body odor. His smell is his life. And as he goes to reach in his wallet you can't help, but notice a couple of his fingers are missing. Partially. The last joint on his index and middle finger. The second joint on his ring. Gone. And of course he can't help but notice you noticing.
	

Construction accident.
	

These words he mutters under his breath before he collects his things and turns to leave. And for a moment you feel bad for him. You pity him. He makes you hate him more, because you can't really hate him. And as he turns to leave he asks you a questions that takes away all the pity you just had for him.
	

*Do you have any jobs available?*
	

This man who made cry most nights out of fear during elementary school. This guy who is the reason your parents wanted to sign you up for therapy. This guy who made you contemplate ending your life in high school is asking you for a fucking job. Your fucking job.
	

And you take a moment to take it in. A thousand different responses flood your brain, but it's difficult to select the right one. So you decide to answer his question with a question. 
	

*Do you know who I am?* 
	

You ask wanting a response, but not expecting an answer. And the man pauses for a moment before answering. He looks at your face. Into your eyes. He looks at you with a blank expression on his face before answering no.

As I awoke this morning from the brief respite provided by the sweaty sleep, it occurred to me just how forsaken we were. The ritualistic sacrifices of vegetables from our fridge had clearly appeased no power god known to man, our choreographed dances and songs to the same purpose were unheard and unseen, and charging my iPhone™ from the car was just plain annoying. We had realized about 20 hours after the power was out that we would have to fend for ourselves for food – and to this end we had begun to drive around 15 miles to the Tysons area for food. Forsooth, we were a ragged crew. The locals had, for the most part, abandoned our powerless village for more fluorescent pastures, and the choice few that remained had sold their family members for generators and the requisite gas to make them run. And yet we had stayed, clinging to order in a brutish world; and yet we had stayed, when the hours turned to days and the gluttonous eating of food before expiration had begun; and yet we had stayed, and harbored hope that Prometheus would once again bring us fire. Perhaps you’re right – we were foolish. A though that had more than once occurred to us as we looked about or shelter, vestiges of power hauntingly lacking that jolt which gave them their life, their purpose. But we were young. We were foolish. We were naïve. And while you sit swaddled in cooled air, your electric addiction fueled by your latest hit, think of us powerless ones. Remember us fondly. Because a world in which I can’t crank up the AC, reach into the cool fridge for a chilled beverage, and watch trashy television is a world I cannot long endure.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1341510842.0,,,True,t3_w2p4c,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/w2p4c/i_lost_power_for_a_total_of_114_hours_over_the/,

A breeze blew by and the hat fell off, but the man continued to sit still, afraid that he would fall. He finally braced himself to look down at the landing place of his hat.

The shoe caught the breeze, landed in the boar’s yawning mouth and was quickly digested. A rumbling crept from the boar’s stomach (boars don’t react well to a specific type of rubber sole) and the beast kicked back his hoof in frustration, rattling the lamp post side to side. The tall man rattled about until his equilibrium was compromised, sending him towards the ugly pig. The man reached his lanky arms outward and grasped onto the boar’s wisp of a tail. Without a proper brace for his fall, he crushed down onto his right knee yelping with pain, but the boar continued to sleep. Curious, thought the man, but he took his hat and wobbled down the walk towards a local drug store. *I’ll take my usual* he demanded to the ethnic shop keep. Before the boy could grab the man a pack of Winstons and a stick of beef jerky the door hammered open. In walked the boar with sleep in his eyes. *Nice day* he snorted, grabbing a tin of antacids with three teeth and placing them on the counter. *Yes. Nice day*. Said the man, counting the floor tiles. *Why were you resting on top of that lamp post?* Asked the boar. *I’m a very tall man and benches rest too low to the ground*.

He cups her hand in his, warming it. He has tears in his eyes as he looks down at her, threatening to breach.


They neared the end of the carpet. Where her fiance stood, waiting, with roses littering his feet. Her favourite flower. As they approached, her father tightly squeezed her hand, forcing a quick, brief smile at the relatives who stood by their sides.


There they were. Her father hugged her fiance, gave her a hard kiss on the forehead, and walked away without looking back. Her fiance looked down at her. ‘Hey darling’, he says, managing a trembling smile. He leaned down and softly kissed her lips. He held his lips on hers for a long time.


He rose, and gently nudged a strand of hair behind her ear. ‘Bye darling’, he says, with his tears softly hitting the rose petals littered around the polished oak box. He straightens to his full height, turns around, and walks away.

Trapped under a code of unspoken law existed a helpless body, the silhouette of a foreign and defected lie. It was on the bridge of denial where this deformed and self-threatening creature attempted to gain validation through the manipulation of belief, determination and euphoria. This creature denied accusation but exaggerated praise. At birth, each of these full of thought, yet thoughtless creatures would be unknowingly blessed with the burden of life. A task, which looked at through rosy glasses could resemble a noble quest, or an extended search for unjustified appreciation. In truth, the task was the opposite, instead of associating, joining or uniting, this species openly chose to disassociate, disjoin and disunite, inherently leading to its fatal yet oppressed demise. Although genuinely curious and often intelligent, the creature chose to rise to its defeat, thus loving itself for what it wasn’t, and hating itself for what it had become.  
 

  
Passive and expecting change, scouring social and political conduct only to grow an acceptance to non-conform, on an ever changing wave that did right to others, but left to self. This creature often attempted to distinguish itself by claiming individuality so it could stand freezing whilst lying on a sweltering background. It was only an imaginary feature that allowed a pulse of self-sanity to remain omniscient. Memories that multiplied the sense of no escape crafted a promise that was already gone, a regret that recommended the colour of black and white. Fraudulence and deceit left a heavy head and feet made of stone, a quest lost, a quest stopped and a quest that questioned a deeper conscience. A painful smile and frown of anticipation, this creature was a twisted yet simple manifestation of everything that it wasn’t and nothing that it was.

1369102969.0,10,self.shortstories,1eqlfb,Deathbed Confession,OOOHJEAH,12,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1eqlfb/deathbed_confession/,"It had taken everything else from him. His feelings began to fade in August of the previous year. Tiredness bled into torpor, torpor bled into apathy, apathy made him seek help that wasn’t helping. He was leaking. It had taken his wife from him. She left in March of this year. She couldn’t deal with the lack of emotion and energy that her husband used to be full of. He was running on fumes. It had taken his friends from him. He couldn’t deal with them anymore. Being around people so full of life began to take its toll on him. He gave them up shortly before his wife left him. He was empty. It had taken his career from him. He didn’t have the energy to show up anymore. He didn’t have anything left. Depression had taken a vibrant life and drained it of everything that had made it worthwhile. He was good as dead.

At this point, it was only a formality that it should be the death of him. And since it couldn’t kill him in the literal sense of the word, he would have to do that himself.

He’d been contemplating it for the past few months now. The question now was not a matter of do or do not, but the execution of it, ironically enough. He didn’t trust himself enough with knots to hang himself. He hadn’t the drive to go purchase a gun. Poison was too cliché. He couldn’t cut himself, he hated blood. He would jump, but he couldn’t stand heights.

A train would do it, though. The thundering of steel at high noon, the shrill shriek of the steam horn, the raw power of ungodly machine, it all seemed morbidly attractive. He would have described it as a type of romantic if he had the feelings to find the words. He had found his end. And so it was settled: he would sacrifice the last of himself to the condition that had taken the rest of him. 

He put on his Sunday best for his final hurrah. When they found his body he wanted it to look good. At least, that’s what the real him would have wanted. If he could have watched himself, would the real him have been happy, though? Two years ago, the real him never would have imagined that he would go down like this, a prisoner of his own life, a victim of his own mind.

If he was really going to do this, he had to stop thinking like that. Conviction was what he needed of himself right now. He was going to pull the trigger.

The rails were surprisingly cold for early September. The trees on either side of the tracks had just begun to shed their leafy vestiges in a snow of orange and red. Perhaps it was appropriate that the forest around him was accompanying him in his demise. As they slowly died, so would he. In the spring, they would come back.


What had really brought him so low? In the days before his demise, he would have said that he began to feel numb in August of last year. In the hours before his demise, he wasn’t so sure. Had he always been this cold on the inside? His life wasn’t flashing before his eyes like in the overly dramatized stories he liked to read. It melted before his eyes. His first memory of youth was inseparable from his memory of last night’s dinner. 

The first sign of the incoming train was the buzz he felt on his head. A light vibration that might have been pleasant if he remembered what pleasant was. The light vibration slowly and methodically became an incessant rattle. His heart fluttered with the frequency of pulsating rails. If he remembered what to call it, he would have recognized this feeling as anxiety. His stomach churned like the bouncing gravel under the tracks. His thoughts were brought to a rolling boil as his blood pressure shot through the roof. He was nervous.

What came after the train hit him? He didn’t let himself believe in a god. Would it be blackness? Would it be peaceful? Painful? Immediate? Eternal? He lacked the answers to the questions he had; this wasn’t the best location to ponder life’s mysteries. Or was it? He hadn’t felt this alive in his whole life. His whole body was quaking with an unnatural tension that frightened him. How could he let himself die when he felt so far from death? He had doubts.

Was this actually what he wanted to do? The rattle from moments before became a thunder in less time than he would have liked. The train was fast approaching and he was frozen in place, his head stuck to the frigid rails, cold sweat pouring from his burning being as his death charged down upon him. Something from within him screamed. He was afraid. He was scared to die.
	
A last thought before impact, a deathbed confession to eternity: He didn’t want to die.

The red LEDs of my alarm clock next to me glow dimly in the dark. 2:30. I had gotten not but an hour of sleep, but still I know I will not be able to return to it. Ah, sleep, the mindless slumber that has eluded me for years. Ever since *you* left.

I turn the dial on the knob next to my bed. The lamp glows, illuminating the room. I get out of my bed and walk to my front room. I consider putting on music, but decide that the rain outside is enough. Rain is my favorite weather. It rained when we lived in Seattle, do you remember that?

On my table lies a folded note I once had written long ago to you. The paper, now soft from age and wear, seems out-of-place in this kind of world. I open it and read it for what seems like the thousandth time in the last few days. I walk outside. The rain softly lands on my clothes. I'm reminded of the old poem I wrote back in high school, sitting in my English class.

    Swish, sway, flux and flow
    Why this happened I don't know
    The man is dead this much is true
    His body hangs, his life is through

    A cotton rope would form a noose
    Not too tight, not too loose
    His life had flashed before his eyes
    Ending in a suicide

    Pitter-patter, says the rain
    Everybody feels the blame
    For a while, the grief is shared
    But in the end nobody cared

I remembered about how I used to be angry all the time. Angry at my family for some dumb reason. Angry at the world for being the harsh reality that it is. Angry at myself for not quite fitting into the world, the way everyone else does, even the odd little boys and girls who spend their nights alone.

As I walk down my street, a stoplight flickers on. I think I see your before realizing that it was just a fence post. I thought I saw you, but perhaps it was just wishful thinking.

What would I do if we met again? If I could see you once more? *I* certainly don't know. I wouldn't like you to see the way I live my life nowadays, half-drunk and wearing last year's clothes, thinking last year's thoughts.

I think about what I used to live for. I realize that my biggest reason to live was for people who needed me, people who were like you. I guess I let you down then. That's why you left. It turns out that no matter how much I wish I could, I couldn't take responsibility for your happiness.

I think if I could do it over, I would have gone with you. Or maybe a few days later. There's no point now. No point to anything.

He said, ""She must be pretty mad.""

  ""You said you dumped her?""

  He swigged his beer. I drank my coffee.  We were on the porch and it was early daytime. 

  ""Yeah, man. I dumped her.""

  I said, ""I figure she must be upset.""

  ""Shit."" He said, and nodded.

  I looked out across the lawn, across the street, and to the other side. An old man stood on his porch in dark blue coveralls and he wore a red hat. From afar, I could only see his eggy skin and blue eyes that I figured must be almost dead up close. He cracked a beer and drank from the can. He kept an eye towards us.

  Johnny started kinda giggling next to me. He wasn't looking out, but in, and he said, ""Yeah, she was pretty mad. You wanna hear something?""

  ""Sure.""

  ""Ok, so we were in bed and I was tired, you know. I'm layin there and I'm trying to fall asleep, because I'd only woken up when she got up to take a shit or something. And I'm still all comfortable in bed when she comes back in, you know, after crappin' her brains out, well, THEN she starts being frisky. Don't get me wrong, I love to do her. But I wasn't so tired I hadn't pictured her crappin' out all those lentils she eats. I mean I know what that shit does to me.""

  I stopped listening. I stopped nodding my head. I lit another cigarette and looked into my empty mug. His words slipped past me. The old man was in his garage then. He seemed to move about carrying the weight of hopeless burdens. He scuffed his boots on the pavement. He put on his work gloves.

  ""After everything, we're all cuddled up and I'm definitely trying to sleep now. Thing is, it's her hair, you know it's so goddam curly and after getting pulled on a bit, it's just a fucking mane. It gets everywhere and I'm laying there and it gets in my mouth and I'm like, 'Fuck!' You know?""

  I was a beat late on this cue. 

  ""Shit, man, you there? Oh, you out of coffee, you fuckin' pussy faggot?"" He said, ""If you're going in there, grab me another one.""

  I went in and was back out when I saw the old timer across the way. He had   two black trash-cans out in the driveway, and he was tying heavy black bags into each. I handed Johnny the beer.

  ""Man, I shoulda said, 'Grab me two,' but I guess this is alright.""

  ""Just shut up and drink it."" I said, ""And you're welcome.""

   We drank our liquids and watched the old man perform. He looked methodical, solemn and only semi-lucid as he enacted this boring brand of magic. Slowly he made his way behind his house and disappeared.

  ""Still nothin'."" 

  ""Nothing?""  

  ""Yeah, she still hasn't sent me anything.""

  I said, ""You're joking.""

  ""I'm tellin ya, she must be on her period or something.""

  ""Women,"" I said.

  Johnny drank his beer and looked at his phone. We heard a large engine start up. Pretty soon, the old man was pulling around the corner of his house in a John Deere. It was bright green and it was rigged for mulching with nylon pouches, but he only had a small lawn. From afar, I figured the soft old bastard must like riding a fancy mower better than dying behind an old, heavy push.

  ""Honestly dude,"" he said, ""I'm kinda getting worried.""

  ""What could have happened?""

  "" I don't know. I'm sure she's just crying or sleeping or something, it's just that the other times I dumped her, it wasn't but fifteen or twenty minutes before she'd send me something.""

  ""Maybe she...""

  ""Oh my God, and those were always the best messages to get from her, too! She'd get like wild. I'd be lying if I said I don't miss those texts.""

  ""Well.""

  ""This one time, I fucked her at her parent's house. I guess that was the first time we fucked. She made me wear a condom, which sucked, but it was still pretty awesome fucking her. Anyway, she said she had heard of some new vaginal condom or diaphragm or something that she was gonna get. She said it was gonna be just for me, cause she knew I hate condoms and I told her I wanted to cum in her.""

  The old man was making quick work with his mower. The blade cut clean through his Bermuda without tearing it. He nudged up against the flower bed too, and he got it good enough that he wouldn't need a weed-eater. He smirked, and I know I saw that.

  ""So about three days before my twenty-first, I'm thinking about who I'm gonna fuck, and I got a couple of options. You know, none are really superstars or anything. Nothing I couldn't live without, but, anyway I'm sensin' that this 'Her-and-I' thing is just gonna fuck me up on what should be the funnest day of my life. So I just ditched her cause I wanted to sleep with Shannon because Shannon's got such big tits. Well, it gets time to meet up with my girl and I'm drunk so I call her. I told her that her pussy is too loose and that I don't want her busted ass anymore. Oh man, she went nuts.""

   ""Makes sense,"" I said.

  ""Yeah, well that night Shannon's friends are like cock-blocking the shit out of me, and then all those bitches run home early because they got a test or some shit the next morning. So I call her back, and she's not happy, but I get her to talk to me and I get her to let me come over. 
  
""It was funny, man, it was fucking funny when I showed up because she opens the door and she's still got on her dress and her make-up is all washed out. And she was so damn mad! I couldn't believe it, but I got her back into bed. I don't know how, man, I was fucking drunk as shit, but I did, and I fucked her until I puked.""

  ""What?""

 ""Yeah."" He smiled.

  ""You twisted son of a...""

  ""Haha, exactly! I puked all over the side of her bed, dude!""

  ""Jesus,"" I said. ""Then what?""

  ""I dumped her for real."" He said, ""I busted my nut, barfed and went home. She texted me later, but not because she was mad, but because she wanted me back.

  ""She was sending me shit like, 'Oh Johnny, please take me back!' you know, but then she'd say stuff like, 'I want you to cum in my pussy cause I just found my diaphragm I'd been telling you about. I'll let you fuck me all night Johnny, I swear. Just come pick me up, Baby. Please. Please Johnny, come back and let me have it!' 

  ""I mean I was blown away by that shit. All the time though, it was stuff like that.""

  ""Just like that?""

  He said, ""Well, you know. Just crazy shit.""

  ""Well maybe she'll text you.""

  ""Yeah."" He said, ""Maybe I'll text her, you know? I mean, just to make sure she's ok.""

  I looked at the old man who was shutting off his mower. Slowly, with aged joints, he moved off the mower's saddle and moved to dump the clippings in the cans. He dragged the just full cans to the curb. He put out the sprinkler. 

  Johnny started stirring and it was hot outside so I started moving to head back inside.

  ""I don't know dude,"" I said. ""I think you gotta make it a rule, and the rule's gotta say you gotta fuck another girl before you can go back to one you already fucked. Otherwise dude, she owns you. You know what I'm saying? You gotta prove to yourself that she isn't the only bitch you can get. I say you find that Shannon girl and smack those tits around just because you can. Then, maybe, think about goin' back to the 'same-old, same-old' bitch who apparently fucking loves you for some stupid fucking reason.""

  ""Damn dude, that's truth right there. That's truth.""

  ""Let the big dog eat,"" I said.

  Johnny laughed hard and said real loud and deep, ""LET THE BIG DOG EAT! ARF! ARF!""

  We laughed and high-fived before Johnny went in checking his phone for numbers. I heard him inside saying, ""Yo Shannon, how you doin', girl?""

  I flicked a dead cigarette butt into my yard, and then saw the old man staring at me. Even from over here on my porch, I could see he looked disappointed. 

  He turned away and started into his house. The door was open as he slowly crossed the threshold and I heard what must've been his wife playing piano. A happy grandma-laugh burst as her song was abruptly halted. I heard her laugh again, then play and sing some bars of ""For He's a Jolly-Good Fellow."" The old man in his work-suit danced the rest of the way past the door. She kept playing, then the door closed, and then their laughter went hidden.

Oh, why can't he run faster?

He's getting closer; he can feel it.

He pushes a small girl aside and she hits the ground. And then she was gone. The girl had disappeared. James stopped running.

*""where did she go?""*

James looked around.

*""Where did everyone go?""*

The street that was a blur with people, cars, lights, and sounds moments ago was now inexplicably empty and so very quiet. He turned his body back to it's original position and saw there, lying in the street, the glowing thing that vexed him so.

He started slowly towards it with sure steps, shaking with anticipation.

*""Finally.""*

He stopped a foot-and-a-half away from the object and lowered himself to the ground. he reached his hand out to touch it and just as fast as everyone disappeared, so did the sun. Darkness stretched far and wide. James could barely see the street.

*""I don't remember the sun setting. It all happened so fast.""*

He looked back to the ground to find that the object--like the little girl-- had gone.
Speechless, he grabbed and scraped at the ground where the object was seconds ago.

Anger and loss made it's way from the bottom of his stomach to the top of his lungs, and he cried out in anguish. He slammed his fists onto the cement, and suddenly, the street was gone.

Falling through the blackness, James screamed and flailed his arms trying to find something--anything-- to hold onto, but found nothing. There was nothing above and nothing below him.
How long had he been falling? Weeks? Months? It felt more like years. 

As time passed, he stopped screaming. He stopped grasping. He sometimes forgot he was still falling. He had become so accustomed to the nothingness; he almost felt like one with it. He felt peaceful. But he still asked the question time and time again:

*""Will I be falling forever?""*

Instantaneously, his body collided with stone. His bones cracked, his bladder released, and his mouth gave way to vomit and then blood. His lungs contracted and expelled all air from it's passages.

Writhing there, half-dead, James could feel is organs begin to shut down. After what felt like hours, his lungs finally relaxed, allowing oxygen to enter. Coughing and gasping, James saw out of the corner of his eye, a faint green glow.

He turned his head and saw the object lying there. The way it sat there, just out of reach, felt like it was mocking him; watching him; laughing at his pathetic situation.

*""I have to destroy it.""*

He searched himself for any shred of strength. He stretched his arms out in from of him and started to drag himself toward the object that he now hated. He drug himself until he saw that, again, he was getting no closer to it.

Dejected, he lay his head on the ground.

**plink**

He looked at the stone floor and saw a little white lump. He picked it up and looked closer.
There in his hands, was a tooth.

**plink**

He looked down and found another. Confused, he ran his tongue along the teeth in his mouth and found two empty spaces; one where a molar once was, and one where a canine should be.

**plink**

Another tooth. And another. And another.
James tried to put them back in his mouth, but his hands felt like they were underwater. He tried to scream, but his mouth was full of gravel. 

The high-pitched squeal of heavy machinery met his ears and bright flash blinded him.

Clutching his chest and gasping, he sat up. The blankets had fallen to the floor and the pillows were at the foot of the bed. The sheets were damp with sweat. Trying to calm himself, James said,

""Only a dream.""

Laying down, He said,

""It was just a dream.""",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1352859863.0,,,True,t3_135lo9,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/135lo9/first_short_story_that_ive_actually_put_effort/,

So, they made a bet.  One of them, the younger, would be ""imprisoned"" in one of the older, richer man's properties / houses.  The deal was for several years (or was it decades?).

Through the years the improsoned man read books and bettered himself, while the rich man continued on with his life.  When the time was near to release the imprisoned man, the rich man was getting nervous.  His wealth wasn't as great as before and (I believe) he would have to pay the imprisoned man a great deal.

However, just before his release, the imprisoned man ""escaped"" and left a note saying he didn't have to be paid.  He has gained a lot of wisdom and this was a lot more than what money can bring.

I met him at the age of 4, his name was Elijah. Never in a million years would I have thought that I would see him fade into colorless dust, brushing away to coat the earth and never be found, leaving his family like a shipwreck in a never-ending tide. Elijah, oh how much I could have done for you, how much I could have done to save you. But in my seven year old shoes, I stood paralyzed as menacing arms gripped mine, with a scolding voice that replayed over and over in my head. One day, we were going to stare deep into each-others eyes, telling ourselves it was where we wanted to be for the rest of our lives. We were going to run in our adult shoes, playing tag, until our legs didn't work anymore. That was our true fate, not this. Nothing would have burnt us to the ground. But now I live with a demon always sitting on my shoulder. He likes to laugh at me for what I've done, reminding me of the horrors over again, just as soon as I try to move on. He binds me with chains of silence, he binds me with a closed mind. He draws the man who burnt my clothes, the man who burnt your life. Elijah, I could have saved you.
Elijah... One day, I hope you will forgive me.


But do you remember our last day together, Elijah? The one where we walked home from school through fields of gold, spinning the earth beneath our feet? Do you remember the sun and how it melted the clouds beneath it, revealing the freckles on our faces? Our hands intertwined unconsciously, as our tiny hearts beat like racing drums. We ran until our laughter knocked us down, and stayed until the sky was coated with marmalade. If only we could have frozen the moment and never moved on. If only we could have both stayed in our seven year old bodies. If only I had never been given the opportunity to grow up alone.


I wish our hands stayed intertwined the whole way through. I wish we closed our eyes, and imagined the sun was melting us into the fields of gold. I wish my little legs didn't learn to escape. I wish it was me instead of you, so that you could have run home to your family, letting them know everything was okay.
And in this moment, I wish the fires that covered you could dry my tears. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_zzd35,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/zzd35/elijah/,

Sandra stared across at Tyler through the small fire. Her eyes seemed to glow with a strange menacing essence. The fire roared and flickered in her small green eyes. The tension between the two was clear. However, Tyler couldn’t read Sandra. She was as clear as solid wood. Tyler felt tense. They were surrounded by miles of forest, in the cold night. No one could hear anything except for him and Sandra, and there’s not much to hear when you’re dead. Suddenly; Sandra opened her mouth slowly, as if to say something. She closed it and glanced over at the tent, grinning. Somehow, outside of the fire’s glare, her eyes seemed to grow with a more malevolent light. She turned back to Tyler, this time right in the eyes.  “I have a surprise for you, Ty.” She said, with a cheerful nickname as if they were old friends. Really, they were both escapees, only together for matters of survival. She turned before Tyler could read her expression. She stood and walked to the tent. Tyler heard some clinks and other miscellaneous sounds. Then, when it appeared she had found what she was looking for, she came back, holding something behind her back. She handed him a small box. It wasn’t anything special, just a dirty old Thai food rice container. “Happy birthday,” she whispered, leaning to the fire. “Blow out the candles..” then, she blew with all her might on the fire, sending flames rolling Tyler’s way as they dissipated, the fire extinguishing. He reached out to feel a box-like shape sitting in the ash pit. He picked it up and folded it open, fumbling his hand inside. The only thing on the inside besides a few grains of old sticky rice was what felt like a folded piece of paper, but no light to read. He realized he was alone in the light, with Sandra. Of whom he knew nothing about. Crazy, mysterious Sandra. He gripped the paper, his heart beating wildly out of his chest. He felt something tap his shoulder and he shut his eyes. “I’m so sorry Ty.. But one of us has to eat.”  He heard a soft, recognizable voice whisper. Then, he felt a sharp pain in his back and made no attempt to wail, knowing it was hopeless- who would hear, and why would they care? Blood gargled out of his mouth as everything he knew started to vanish. People say your life flashes before your eyes before you die, but it doesn’t. It disappears, everything you know, to the point of insanity. You forget what’s happening and all that’s going through your head is; ‘I am about to die.’ Managing to struggle to words, he choked out through all the blood, “I’ll never forgive you for this.” Sandra smiles in the dark, and then something wet drips on Tyler’s head. Then he realized; she was crying. “You won’t have time to fret on the past in hell, Ty..” She whispered, as he closed his eyes, just to never open them again.

Candy and Pepper strolled through the woods when a morbid smell wafted through Candy’s nose. “Gosh, what’s that awful smell?” Then, suddenly she realized as they approached it; a body, pieces of skin torn off, blood splattered everywhere, as if someone appeared to attempt to consume it.  The person was obviously a man. Folded in his hand was a small piece of paper. Pepper leaned down and picked it up, unfolding it, softly reading it to himself. 'See you soon, I figure I can’t live off you forever. I’ll never forgive myself, either. In our short time together I grew attached, but my life came before you in my eyes, Ty.

It had only been a few days since we had left the mainland, and only a week since the infection had been first reported. Corpses scattered across war zones, covered with the settled remnants of radioactive dust from chemical weapons had begun reacting... twitching... moving. It was only a day later that the first scientists and reporters became the first victims and the first living humans turned. From there, the destruction and rate of infection had exploded.

Within 24 hours of the firsts, reports came in of massive hordes of reanimated corpses occupying major cities... turning all that stood in their way. Several countries tried sending their armies to quell the situation, but that only worsened it. Guns only did so much to zombie armies, hundreds of thousands deep, and with large explosions from tanks and bombs, came even wider contamination due to the chemicals in the corpses being disturbed and pushed higher into the atmosphere. It had become airborne...

The only escape was to rural areas, or to the sea. I chose the latter... it was only a matter of time before even the rural areas would not be as safe as people had hoped.

""LAAAAAAND!""

An island... Those in charge had said that there we would be safe from any sort of infection. We were students and teachers. Soldiers and doctors. Men, women, and children. We were, quite possibly, one of the few hopes for maintaining the species.

""Where the hell are we?"" Sgt. Reynolds barked at one of the older gentlemen who had been appointed captain of the vessel. The original captain was... well, he didn't make it. Reynolds was a former Drill Instructor and has taken to appointing himself the leader of our group. At least we had someone to tell us what to do... Most of us were so disillusioned with the situation that we could barely talk.

There were only a few dozen of us who had made it onto the ship from the harbor. It was a miracle any of us had made it off the mainland alive, and even more so considering the only food we had we were lucky enough to have recovered from the bowels of the ship. It seemed as if the original captain had been preparing to live at sea until he could come up with a plan as to how the hell he could survive in a world full of flesh devouring corpses... But food for one man only goes so far between a group.
Zombies. They were fucking zombies. All of the films and stories had done nothing more than make us lower our guard as to how real a possibility the walking dead were.

""I have no idea, but we don't have the resources to care right now.""
Most everyone was on deck, now, staring at the monolithic island before us. Whether we liked it or not, it was our new home, for now anyways. I, for one, was eager to get off the ship. I had always been afraid of the emptiness of the ocean. Funny how little your fear of the unknown matters when you’re faced with fear of something much greater and much more terrifying. Still, it felt great to know I would be able to step off of that heap I considered to be my floating coffin.
Staring at the coastline, all I could see was sand, and a thick tree line leading into a lush forest. I was looking at trees I had never seen before that looked like they had been there for far longer than I could imagine. Vines and thick brush started to come into view the closer we got. And then something in the trees... Fruit! Or at least something that resembled the fruit I was familiar with! We were going to be able to survive for at least some time longer. Relief flooded my body. Relief that we were going to be ok. That I wasn't going to die at sea with no hope of survival. Relief that...

My eyes locked onto something in the underbrush as we closed in further on the island. Something reflective... but what? The relief turned to panic as I realized what I was staring at. We were being watched. Those were eyes.

I glanced around for Reynolds. We needed to be prepared that we might have company when we landed. The undead? Impossible. Not this far out, there was no way. By the time I had looked back, the eyes were no longer visible to me. Maybe I was seeing things...
""Start unloading some supplies for a reconnaissance team to check out the island and we'll see if we can find any food, shelter, or signs of intelligence on this rock."" Reynolds booming voice effortlessly carried itself.

I had convinced myself that I just needed to get off of the boat when a shriek erupted from the forest. A sound like nothing I had ever heard. The sound of a screaming jet engine combined with the emotional tones of something living... something communicating. Birds flew from the canopy of the forest as we all stared silently into the mysterious interior of the island.

""It doesn't matter, we can't stay on board,"" Reynolds projected over the deck, already knowing what we were all silently wondering.
""Besides, nothing can really be as bad or as frightening as what we've all already seen and been through...""

None of us could have possibly known how wrong he was.

She was his everything. He thought about her while working. He thought about her while eating. Hell, he even thought about her while thinking about her. To him, she was perfect. And he had never even said so much as a single word to her.

He first saw her clearing tables across the restaurant; her tight black skirt giving the perfect outline of her backside. The way she had glanced back as if she could feel his eyes burning holes in the fabric made his heart race. Her raven colored hair and rounded, black eyeglasses made her porcelain skin glow even more. He could remember it like it happened mere seconds ago.

A taut white blouse, black skirt, and glossy black sneakers. She always wore the same outfit to work. It was the same attire the others wore, but he never paid enough attention to them to make the connection. When he was in the coffee shop, he only had eyes for her.

Each day he went to the coffee shop to see her. He noticed she was quite shy and even when nearing his section, she kept her head down. This never bothered him, so long as she was close by he would take what he could get.

He noticed she was being trained to replace an elderly server retiring soon. If only she would come by his table, he would be able to profess his love for her.

Then one day, he got his wish.

She seemed to glide as she made her way to his table. “I’m Amy. I’ll be your waitress today,” she breathed, as she looked up from the checkered tile floor toward his expectant gaze.

Finally, their eyes met. Her beautiful smile was the perfect match to his glowing face. As she brushed her hair softly behind her ear, she slowly pulled her glasses down from her face. In that moment, his heart seemed to burst from his chest, for she had a lazy eye.

“Welp, plenty of fish,” he murmured to himself as he exited the shop.

What I feel right now is inharmonious. The whole reason I came to these groups in the first place is to feel included, and now dead people don't even want me.  The advertisement for the support group held at the local church stated that the support group was for the ""terminally ill."" How was I supposed to know that suicide didn't fall under that category? Besides, I had a few colds in my life. I was no stranger to the stomach flu. Who cares if I stretched the word ""terminal"" out to include myself? I need as much help as any of them. 
	

You see when you're in a room full of people who would do anything for a couple of extra years of life, they don't take too kindly to those who are willing to throw them all away over a broken heart, and a gallon of bleach. But I can't help it! I'm as helpless as the rest of them. It's as if they think I asked for an inflamed case of depression paired with an overwhelmingly low self-esteem. Still, when it's my turn to speak the room is furnished with exaggerated sighs, and rolling eyes. 
	

More and more it seems like the only time I feel alone is when I'm surrounded by people.
	

If it were just about them I wouldn't be here. In fact if it were anyone else, but her, I wouldn't be here. As luck would have it I happen to be kind of in love with Jenna Lane. And the truth is I haven't spoken to her yet, but when you're as emotionally unstable as me feelings like love come pretty easily.
	

Even if I wasn't suffering from any mental anguish, I would still love her. How could I not? Here she is suffering from brain cancer and still finds time to make a fresh batch of cookies for everyone each week. Her smile makes me smile. Her laugh makes me laugh. She's not the prettiest girl I've seen in my life, but there is something about her that is so endlessly beautiful in the most refined sense of the word. She's the Mona Lisa, not exactly divine, but still a masterpiece. 
	

I had it bad for this girl, and tonight would be the night that she would find out. I just didn't know how to bring it up. Do I tell her point blank? Stand on a table in the center of the room, and proclaim my love for this girl I have yet to meet? Ride in on a white horse, whisk her away, and ride into the sunset together? And just as my imagination started to get carried away the opportunity presented itself. 
 

Martha Goldstein was in the middle of detailing her struggle in the late stages of ASL, when Jenna was started dosing off.  Her head slowly lowered, her eyelids began to shut, and by the time it came to Benjamin Bloom and his battle with Huntington's disease Jenna Lane had fallen asleep on my shoulder. 
	

And what I feel right now is elated.
	

By the time the group is over my shirt is soaked in saliva. People stand up to put away their chairs and grab a cup of coffee, while I stay seated with Jenna content with being her pillow. 
	

After she had woken up she apologized profusely for the falling asleep on me, and apologized even more when she saw the lake that she had created  on my shoulder. I accepted every apology she gave me, and asked if I could walk her to her car. 
	

As we walked she told me about what school she had gone to, and how she had to take some time off after she got sick. She told me about her parents, and her little brother at home, and to be honest I didn't retain much of anything she said. I was too overjoyed that I, the suicidal self-loathing guy that not even people on the verge of death liked, had the opportunity to walk Jenna to her car. 
	

When we reached her vehicle I was disappointed by how short the walk was. We exchanged awkward goodbyes, and as I went for a hug she extended her hand. Jenna had stepped into her car, and slipped the key into the ignition before I had obtained enough courage to ask for her number. 
	

The words fell clumsily from my mouth but she didn't seem to notice. Instead she just smiled, fetched a piece of paper and pen from her purse, and wrote down seven of the world's most valuable numbers on the paper before handing it to me. 
	

This is how I met Jenna Lane.
	

I know in theory you are supposed to wait a couple days before calling a girl, but with Jenna I had to contain myself from entering her number the minute I walked through the door. I believe I had made it approximately one day, ten hours, and forty-seven minutes before I finally caved. 
	

Before I called her I spent at least twenty minutes planning out what I was going to say, but the second she answered the phone my training departed from me. The sound of her voice escaping through the confines of my cell phone was simply euphoric. I fumbled my way through a couple minutes of aimless small talk, when Jenna finally stopped me. 
	

""Did you call me to ask me out?"" she asks. And I recover just enough of myself to reply with a feeble ""yes.""
	

""Well I would love to go on a date with you,"" she would say followed with something along the lines of, ""that is of course if you're okay with dating a girl with an expiration date.""
	

And what I feel right now is lucky.
	

I take Jenna to play mini golf, because that's what everyone who feels like a movie and dinner are too cliché does. I start to win, but decide to let her beat me because I want so badly for her to be happy with me. I buy ice cream afterwards, and when I dropped my cone face down on my lap she pretends not to notice, and offers to share hers. 
	

As I drive her home there is no room for silence. My car is filled with laughter and conversation the entire ride. I pulled up to her house, and walked her to her doorstep. We exchange awkward goodbyes, and as I extend my hand she goes in for a hug.  
	

She asks me when she can expect to see me next, and I say in the most confident voice I can muster, ""How about next week?"" She says she'd love that. I say I would too. She kisses me on the cheek before entering her house.
	

Over the next couple of months I see Jenna Lane more and more.  And over the next couple of months life doesn't seem so bad. It didn't matter what we did. We could watch paint dry for all I cared, but whenever I am with Jenna life just makes sense, the way I would imagine life to feel for people without suicidal tendencies, or brain cancer. 
	

It was a Tuesday when she told me to come over to her house. We had plans for a date Thursday night, but she called me out of the blue and requested that I come over. 
	

""I want you to have sex with me,"" she tells me.
	

And being the smooth talking man I am I responded with a delayed ""What?""
	

""Sexual intercourse. You know what that is, yeah? Do you remember that expiration date we talked about? I don't know when it's coming, but it's coming soon. I just want to have sex. Is that so much to ask for?"" She says comically. 
	

And the sad thing was it was true. She was dying. The light in her eyes had dimmed, her hair was slowly falling out, and her body had grown constantly smaller and smaller. In a perfect world I would have liked to wait. Planned it out, and done something romantic that may or may not have involved candles and rose petals, and maybe some fireworks, but who was I do deny a girl her dying wish? 
	

We fuck. At least that's what it feels like. Nothing more nothing less. I pray that she's a virgin, and wonder if she loves me or if this is just for sport. Because the truth is I'm kind of madly in love with her. 
	

What I want her to do is make a mistake, because perfection comes so naturally to her. I want her to be flawed. I want her to be vulnerable. I want her love me the way I love her, even though I know she can't. 
	

There are empty spaces in everyone's lives. I'd like to think that we try the best we can to make sure those places are filled. But no matter hard you try there are going to be those moments that leave you feeling empty. There's that pretty girl at the coffee shop that you wanted to talk to, but didn't. That trip you've always wanted to take, but never booked the flight. The paths of our lives are paved with missed opportunities, and hearts that we never had the chance to break.
	

Jenna understood this. She had accepted her fate. She knew that soon she would be nothing more than a corpse rotting in the ground. She had no time for love, or petty crushes. What she needed was a friend. Someone to share these experiences with. She wasn't heartless. Jenna was just trying to make sure she didn't miss anything, before she was gone. 
	

And what I feel right now is cheated. 
	

Because all of this is an illusion. The walk to the car, the date, the sex all of these the fabric of my imagination. Everything but the saliva.
	

The saliva drips through my shirt, and I can't help but wonder if it's a side effect of brain cancer. Hyper active salivation glands. As soon as Kathy Green wraps up her anecdote about her fight against AIDS Jenna is awoken.  
	

Still she profusely apologizes, and I still accept her apologies. She offers to pay me for a new shirt, but I tell her it's an old shirt. That I don't care about it anyways.
	

After everything is taken down I help Jenna carry the platter in which she brought cookies on to her car, and the conversation stays light and general. The weather has been nice. School is fine.
	

As she's packing the platter and leftover cookies into her trunk, I ask her what she's doing that night, if maybe she would like to go see a movie with me.
	

""My boyfriend and I are actually going to play mini-golf tonight,"" is what she tells me. ""Maybe some other time.""
	

""Sure, maybe next time,"" I say closing the trunk of her car for her.
	

And what I feel right now is broken.
	

We exchange awkward goodbyes. As I extend my hand she extends hers, and as we're standing there in the parking lot shaking hands she asks me what my name is.

G: and I have a nice voice

R: Don't forget how modest you are

G: Oh!  I forgot that one!  I'm the most modest man on earth!

G: Think about it... a life with me would be full of laughter and romance and good food!

R: Are you trying to romance me with this?

G: Hmm, I don't know... is it working?

R: ...

R: I'm starting to think you have a quota to fill.. that you must propose to me at least once every single day

R: you seem to be doing that

G: Well, if you ever say yes, imagine how romantic it would be to tell our children:

G: ""He proposed to me every day for 2 years, until I finally said yes, on Sept 17th, 2012!""

R: lol, you wish!

G: *obviously!*

G: The kids will say, ""why did you keep asking, Daddy?""

G: And I'll say, ""Because, once you meet an angel, you'd be a fool to not do everything on your power to win her heart'

G: Then they'll say, ""why did you say yes, mommy?""

R: and just what will I say, in this hypothetical future?

G: You'll say, ""I said yes because he told us about this day, with my perfect children and my handsome, romantic husband.  And I knew that was the future I wanted, and now it's come true, more perfect than I could ever imagine.""

G: And then I'll kiss you deeply

G: And our children will say ""ewww""

G: And it will still be romantic as always

G: Then we'll tuck them in together, and go out to our porch with a glass of wine and watch the stars, wrapped in eachother's arms

R: aww

R: ok, that was seriously cute

G: :-)

R: We also have to put Nanny back in the dog house

R: and make sure the windows are closed.

R: Then it'll be a good night

G: Lol... of course

G: ...

G: Tell the truth, you liked that one even better than my sunset-horseback-picnic-proposal scenario from last week.

R: Oh come on, if I told you you'd never come out of the clouds

G: you have to tell!  For Science!

R: nope

R: A girl's gotta keep some secrets

G: Well, it seemed like a perfect future to me :-)

R: You'll just never know :-)

G: I don't know about that, maybe one day you'll say yes

G: and I'll get to live it :-)

R: Perhaps

Cat/housesat for a coworker, wrote this when they returned from their vacation to let them know all that’s happened. Posted it on facebook as my status and got positive feedback, so I’m sharing it here too.
My name is Boris Kuslitskiy. Please don’t steal this.
 
 
Thursday.
You leave, the cats are plunged into the unexpected onset of Feast 2012, gorging on dry cat food.
 
Friday.
Ryan leaves us, the going away party includes alcohol, as does the bar I attend after. Arriving home at 5AM, I decided not to grace the cats with my presence again just yet.
 
Saturday Evening.
I arrive to feed and water the cats. Simon is friendly, Lionel chooses to ignore my presence.
 
Sunday.
The cats starve and dry out, reduced to only helping themselves to endless amounts of dry cat food. They operate with a different definition of starve than we do.
 
Monday Evening.
I stop by on my way from the movies with a friend, Sasha. Simon is distant, and fat, while Lionel is nearby, and fatter. Sasha confirms my analysis.
 
Tuesday Night.
I arrive late, commence furtending, continue furtending, and, finally, complete furtending. Having nowhere else to hang my work clothes for the next day, I prop open the bedroom door and hang them off the top. This lets Simon sit on the living room table and stare into the bedroom, into my eyes, and into my soul, were I to have one. He does this without fail, slowly falling asleep and staring at me through drooping eyelids as the minutes pass. I have broken his sense of order and he is no longer nice to me. Without shifting his gaze, Simon invents a time machine, locking me in his unrelenting stare for approximately 2.6 eternities. This is unsettling, but eventually the time machine falters and I sleep.
 
Wednesday Morning.
The first thing I see upon leaving the bedroom is Lionel rolling over to expose his belly. This is irresistible and just about cancels out having a shorter commute to work. Soon after, I scratch the underside of his cheek, and Lionel pushes his not unremarkably soft and fat face into my hand until it’s pressed down firmly against the ground. Noting the unforgiveable interruption in scratches, he graciously lifts his head, allows my hand to rise up to meet his cheek, and proceeds to push it down to the ground again. This repeats.
 
Wednesday Evening.
I arrive, Sasha joining me soon after I finish the furtendings. Beer, wine, and scratches flow furily. Sasha titles Simon Flat-Face. In response, his face is emotionless, flat, and furry. Lionel adopts the name Fat-Face, and my hand. I will file to reclaim custody shortly. Sasha sleeps over, being offered the bedroom while I claim the couch as my own.
 
Night between Wednesday and Thursday.
Sasha wakes up to see Simon inches away from her face, staring at her. I have the vaguest inkling of a feeling that Simon does not particularly like it when anybody else sleeps in that bed.
 
Thursday Morning.
Lionel is adorable. Simon is a cat.
 
Thursday Evening.
A different friend comes over. Lionel remains fat while Simon remains a cat. Together, they mostly are fat, and hide, their hides being fat, and hidden.
 
Friday Morning.
Reclined on the couch with my hand scratching the nearby Lionel, I conceive of an experiment, utterly moronic in hindsight. What if, just once, I choose to not spend every free moment scratching Lionel? Still purring like a tractor with a megaphone, Lionel jumps up onto the couch, wanders across my body and then, first gently, then heavily, struts his way across my neck, leaning his side against my face and forcing his furriness into every crevice, his fat molding itself to my face, leaving no respite and much hair.
 
Sunday Evening.
I stop by to pick up my things and scratch Lionel. He seems to have acquired a better invisible megaphone, as he purrs even more loudly.
 
Monday.
I miss them.
 
Tuesday.
I miss them.
 
Wednesday.
I fondly recall the fat smothering my face as Lionel saunters across my neck. I can almost taste the fur now.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1340763176.0,,,True,t3_vg6i3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/vg6i3/was_asked_to_catsit_for_a_coworker_so_i_wrote_up/,

I hope you like it :),WoutervD,11,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/shyjc/500_word_postapocalyptic_story_i_wrote_today_i/,"Viktor sneaked inside the remnants of a collapsed parking garage just in time. Two Toxins walked by, talking loudly, boasting about their 'accomplishments,' such as beating up a defenceless twelve-year-old. Cowards. But with Tox in command, and his private army of Toxins patrolling the streets, this was the way of the world.

Viktor himself had been recruited as a Toxin. He was plucked from the street and had to start training under strict surveillance. After the first round, he received an 'E' rating, meaning he had the build, speed and intelligence to train for the elite squad, Tox' personal guards. This also meant the surveillance measured were slacked. Within a week Viktor had crafted a knife of a piece of bent metal and some charred wood, held it to a guards' throat and ran of. That's why he had to be so careful to stay out of sight.  

The wisest thing would be to hide, to run off into the woods and never go back. But Viktor knew he was the only one capable of overthrowing the reign of the maniac Tox had become. He had seen an inside view of the guarding system. He was lean, swift and bright. He could craft a weapon out of nearly anything. Most importantly, he wasn't afraid of some blood on his hands.

It's not as if he walks through the street randomly cutting out young boys' gobs, like some of the Toxins do. But he wasn't one to let harm come upon himself and he wielded his knife in any way necessary. When the Toxins were gone, Viktor crept out of hiding and continued his path. At seventeen, he was one of the oldest boys still alive. When the collision drew near, it was decided that all fifteen-year-olds would live. They were old enough to take care of themselves and eventually reproduce, but young enough to adapt and create government in the new world. When all the fifteen-year-olds were saved, the remainder of places in the bunkers was distributed to anyone between twelve and eighteen. Viktor had been lucky, unlike many.

The silence was pierced by a shuffling sound and Viktor turned with a start. There was no one there, except a rat gnawing on something that looked suspiciously much like human flesh. Irritated by the distraction, Viktor threw one of his knifes. The rat let out a shriek as it was skewered, then dropped dead. It tumbled off of the beam it was crawling over, into the basement of the garage. It was a shame to lose that knife, but Viktor was happy. In the end, he would only need one. Tox' lair was in sight and his training, carried out all alone in the woods, proved solid. He stowed away his other weapons and starting creeping along the final mile.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_shyjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/shyjc/500_word_postapocalyptic_story_i_wrote_today_i/,

In 1939, World War II broke out. Like many English children of his generation, he was sent by his parents to live in Canada to escape the Blitz. When he returned to his home country he barely recognized it. England had been ravaged by the war and he felt as though there was nothing for him there, so he left. He went back across the Atlantic, but this time to Philadelphia. It was there that he met my grandmother.

Before she met my grandfather, my grandmother had been previously married to a US Air Force bomber pilot who was stationed in England during the war. While in England, he began an affair with another woman that caused the disintegration of his marriage to my grandmother. She eventually met my grandfather, they got married, and they gave birth to my mother who eventually met my father and gave birth to me.

I use to joke to people that if it weren’t for Hitler starting the war then I would never have been born. The other day, I told this to a friend who told me that if it weren’t for every single event in the history of the universe, from the Big Bang till the precise moment when a single sperm from my father entered a single egg from my mother, then I would never have been born.

But if you feel the need to indulge yourself, I can't stop you. I will tell you one thing, though, it won't be a fun ride. This isn't the type of thing you discuss amongst your family around the dining room table. Even though you can feel in the air how much they want to ask you about it - as taboo as the subject is - there's no way they'll cross that line. But there's always that one friend who doesn't understand boundaries and why you shouldn't cross them. That ignorant bastard. 

""So, did you kill anybody?""

I can feel my heart sink into my stomach, and with those five words all the memories I've tried so desperately to repress come flowing through my mind.

Images forever burned into my conscience.

How we got into this situation was the same for most of us: we wanted to heroes.  Granted, there is that one guy - down on his luck -  whose up to his knees in debt. They told him all his worries would disappear if he just signed on the dotted line. He needed a way out and couldn't think of any other options. But even then, in the back of his mind, the idea of ending another man's life without consequence, maybe even praise, had to impact his decision in some way. He could have chose a safer job... Anything but Combat Arms. But why fix the damage when you can inflict the damage?  You're a joke if you get a medal for making sure everyone gets paid on time. 

In the long run all we really want is recognition. 

One-hundred and thirty-eight days in country and not a single thing to write home about. You could feel the hostility in the air. Each and every one of us were growing tired of the monotony. All we wanted was a real reason to clean our weapons. And this is the insanity that the US Military inflicts among its indentured servants. Train a man to kill, give him guns and grenades, throw him into a desert and suddenly he wants to get shot at. We were all normal once-upon-a-time. Eventually everything fades to gray and you can't remember what exactly normal is anymore. At this point every man in Charlie Co. Fire Squad Alpha doesn't realize they've crossed the point of no return.

I couldn't see what I was shooting at, but it didn't matter. The gurgled screams let me know I was hitting something, though, and it felt good. The lesson I learned that day is that Positive Identification isn't always necessary. Before I get ahead of myself, let me explain. Those bastards thought they could run into a Mosque and they would be safe. Well, your Holy Place isn't mine. Your God can't judge me. Out here, life is a gift, and you have to be willing to take that gift away without a second thought about it. 

Out here, standing by a road with a shovel can get you killed. 

With my adrenaline pumping I guess I didn't notice what time it was... it just slipped my mind. All that matters is the target was eliminated; mission complete. The weight had immediately been lifted off my shoulders. I finally got what I was looking for and I felt vindicated.  

After the C4 blast there wasn't much left of the Mosque, and the screams finally subsided. Sifting through the rubble, the pride I felt started to subside, and a sense of nausea overcame me. I stumbled upon what appeared to be a hand - a tiny little hand. I had never seen gore like this. A hand, a foot, an arm, a leg. Things unrecognizable as human. What have I done? These people weren't the enemy. These were human beings like you and I. Men, women, and children reduced to humps of body parts. I can never look at a hamburger the same way again.

""Soldier, you're about to learn a very important lesson today."" 

This was all too much to take in.

""Why do you think when we find a weapon cache every vehicle gets an RPG stowed in the back?""

Stunned, I didn't want to know.

Sergeant collected 3 RPGs and scattered them in the ruins of what once was a Mosque. stepping back and observing the scene, without a hint of emotion in his face, he took in a deep breath.

""When we get back to the FOB, CID will be there to conduct their investigation, so we'd better get our story straight. I'll tell you this, though, Soldier. Tomorrow you'll be on the cover of Stars &amp; Strips. You're going to be a War Hero.""",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1ekdqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ekdqf/collateral_damage/,

concrete wall in this small, dark room. I feel a dampness under me, it 
reminds me of when I was younger and would play in puddles after a 
storm; the only difference is now I am a middle aged adult and I don’t
 have any shoes. Chills race through my body as my weak heart pushes
 me through another cold night. I can hear pain-driven moans of other
 middle aged men in other rooms much like my own. I haven’t been able
 to keep a meal down for days and I think my body is finally giving up
 on me. It smells like a high school bathroom that hasn’t been washed in
 weeks, but I have become immune to the putrid smells that would sting
 the nose of a hog. All I wish for in these hopeful final hours is a room
 mate, someone I could talk to and tell my final secrets to; someone to
 tell my story to, or at least make up a story. The moans are getting
 louder. I could try and lay in my mattress, but I don’t want to die laying
 on something that isn’t mine. This isn’t the jail life that is romanticized
 on TV and in books, this is the real jail life of Sector 858.

	It all started in the year 2024 when the government started telling
 everyone of the wonderful life that could be possible if we accept a few
 changes in how society is. That should have been the first indication of
 hell; we should have known from the beginning that nothing good
 comes when people try to change what feels natural. We embraced it
 though, we trusted them, we thought the people behind the locked
 doors knew what was good for us. They told us the only sacrifice we
 would make is breaking a few friendships and that this would only be a
 sacrifice for a closer society and a closer web of companions. Their big
 plan in a nutshell was to organize people like files in a computer. We
 would be organized by occupation, and further organized into a
 bureaucracy of social status. The people never really changes, the only
 change was a mass feeling of loneliness; that was our second chance to
 realize this couldn’t work, we ignored it trusting them. Within two
 years, everyone was moved into cities, sectors as they became known
 as. There was a business sector, a factory sector, an art sector, a
 sector for just about every occupation, or at least somewhere every
 occupation would fit into. 

	The worst of these sectors was Sector 213; this was where they
 sent everyone that could not work or was not willing to work. I was
 never there, I only heard stories, rumors. Nobody left their sector,
 there was a commitment that was needed in the new society. The only
 way information was spread between sectors was through the internet,
 but the internet turned out to be as honest as the men that set up our
 new lives. Sector 213 consisted of everyone from drug dealers to
 hitmen to the mentally handicapped to the mentally insane. The types
 of people varied drastically, and this led to chaos. At first, stories on
 the internet were trustable, they seemed realistic for the people living
 in Sector 213. Everyone knew what types of people lived here from the
 handbook given to every citizen of the new society, which listed all 914
 sectors and what group of people belonged to them. Sector 213
 consisted of “noncontributing individuals.” The details of Sector 213 are
 not important to the grand scheme of what ended up being this nation
 by  the year 2031, present time.

	Times were alright after awhile; people were feeling connected
 and sector life became centered around what people actually did with
 their lives, which looked like it would make life more bearable.
 Problems started coming with the children. Children could not be born
 into an occupation; as much as the they wished we could be computers,
 we weren’t. They found a solution. They promised happiness and
 wellbeing to our children. This was our third and final chance to see
 where this was all leading, we missed it. They took away our children
 to Sector 864, “schooling and developing.” Our lives became more and
 more centered around work, less and less around relationships and
 family. People began to forget what having a family even was.

	Stories of pain and chaos stopped showing up on the internet,
 replaced by stories of success and happiness in other sectors. I thought
 my sector was special, I thought maybe this sadness was special to me
 and my brothers and sisters, that’s what we called each other in my
 sector. We wrote manuals, manuals for putting things together, taking
 things apart, pretty much anything that needed a manual. I thought
 maybe my sector was sad because there was no advances to be made
 in our occupation, nothing new ever; it was always the same, typing
 steps to putting together and taking apart things made by other sectors.
 Honestly, I never minded it, it was easy and relaxing. I had a few close
 friends that I worked with and got drunk with occasionally. It was one
 night in particular that really got my thoughts changing.

	We were drinking beers and sitting in my friend Mark’s living
 room. We were laughing and making fun of some of the things we were
 writing manuals for, it was a fun night. Then Dan, a friend of mine from
 before all the changes happened, brought up something from before the
 change. He started talking about this book that people would write in
 and it would help others understand what you do for a living; you would
 write in as much depth as you chose about your job and what you do.
 There was obviously no need for it anymore after all the changes, but
 Dan bringing this up brought up a rush of nostalgia. I felt myself sink
 into the couch I was sitting in as my mind began to wander into
 memories of my family. I had a brother and two sisters, they were
 twins. Luckily they ended up in the same sector because they were
 exceptional athletes. I felt my heat sinking a little into my chest and I
 began to miss my life from before the change. The change that struck
 me at that moment that I never realized before was the lack of
 curiosity. There was nothing new, nothing to wonder about because
 there was nobody else besides yourself. Everyone in a sector was
 almost an exact clone of each other. I began to feel more lonely than I
 did ever before that moment.

	Every day after that dreadful night felt like a repeat of the day
 before, but every day got worse in some way. I felt my hair getting
 longer, my sighs getting longer and my body getting weaker as I began
 to lose hope in a life that meant anything. I wanted to matter, I wanted
 more than anything to not be a clone in some sector where everyone is
 the same and just another gear pushing this nation along. I decide it
 was time for change.

	I began working out a way to escape my sector. I looked through
 the handbook and found which sectors I wanted to go to: Sector 213,
 “artists,” Sector 457, “scientists,” Sector 110, “psychologists,” and
 Sector 54, “weapon experts.” My final location would be Sector 1.
 Sector 1 was where the leaders were living; nobody knew anything
 about it. I had no idea how I would even get out of my sector, it took
 more planning and surveying of the wall that confined my sector. I
 planned on leaving and heading east, looking for any sector to see if I
 could find a pattern or organization of the sectors.

	I finally left in 2030. I found a hole in the wall that I could crawl
 through. Outside of this hole, I saw sunlight like I have never seen
 before, it burned my eyes. Freedom, an open land that people could not
 even dream of anymore. I smelled trees and nature, it smelled like a
 park I went to as a child, I felt a smile slowly overtake my face, then
 tears leaking from my eyes. I stepped out of the bubble that help my
 life for a few long years. I forgot what real weather was like, I felt a
 frigid cold begin to climb up my legs. I took a few steps, it felt like
 hours, I was overcome by happiness and this new feeling of freedom. I
 was about twenty feet from the wall when I heard a loud, high-pitched
 noise pierce through my skull. An alarm.

	There was an alarm going off in my sector, time slowed down
 even more as I turned around to look. I felt every muscle in my body
 begin to tense up and every hair on my arms and legs raise, this made
 the cold air feel even crisper. I saw a tall tower that I somehow missed
 while living in the sector, and in this tower was a few men staring at
 me. I could see the look in their eyes, they looked like leopards that
 just saw a deer that walked away from its pack. The look that burned
 into my brain and felt like hours as I saw the man raise a gun, I was
 frozen. There was nothing I could do anymore, I waited for whatever
 was in that gun to pierce my skin and take me away. I was unaware of
 what happened next, but I woke up in a dark cell; my new room.

	This is where I am now. My life lasted another year I estimate it
 to be. After everything that happened, after everything I wanted to
 change, all that resulted was me sitting in my own sweat, slowly dying
 as alone as I was in Sector 858. I don’t know any of the other men in
 this jail, all I know is they are men I may or may not have worked
 with. I never learned about any other sectors, I can’t even be sure
 there are other sectors anymore. I can’t be sure there are other people
 besides the ones I hear moaning every day. I guess you can never be
 certain of anything that isn’t you. I realized the only truth I ever knew
 what what I felt inside. I wish I had realized what was happening from
 the beginning, I wish I had trusted myself instead of the people trying
 to change what I knew was natural. I don’t regret anything I did, I only
 regret what I didn’t do sooner.

Walls that once used to be white but are now a light brown shit yellow, from all the cigarettes smoked during bowel movements, and other activities. Now, if that didnt give away the fact that i was talking about a bathroom, then im not completely confident that there is hope for you, and your advancement in this floating ball we call home. Anyway before i go off on a long tangent that has really nothing to do with the story, but yet again everything to do with the story. The bathroom, where daydreams can be relived, pressures can be relieved, tanks can be emptied, and where unborn children are given mandatory flying lessons. But im not here for any of those reasons. Im not resting on the cold pot, or washing my face in the dripping sink, or even trying to find the frustrating medium of cold and hot water to take a replenishing shower. Oh no, i am here for reasons much more dark, dark enough as to the sun couldnt even keep it lit. And the funny part is, this is no tunnel, theres no light at the end of this cave.


As i climb the rocks in the cave, i sweat, i cry, i laugh, out of psychosis of course, but laughed nonetheless, and most of all i wanted to be out of there. I walk, i run, i jump, and i never rest, getting out of the cave is my only goal any more. I need to see who is waiting for me at the entrance, who missed me, who cared enough to wait because somewhere deep down they knew i would make it out. How long have they been waiting, but the more important question is, how much longer will they wait. Enough with the metaphorical speak. When i say climbing rocks and caves, i mean pressing my whole body weight against the bathroom wall in an attempt to make my self upright. Everything is heavy, standing is now a task that deems harder that solving a rubiks cube with one hand and color blindness. All i can see is the mirror, and what i saw, oh man what i saw, is what really makes this story take off.

1361534713.0,8,self.shortstories,190mhy,[True Story] Friends and I found underground tunnels under high school in Wisconsin (with pictures),Johspwns,9,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/190mhy/true_story_friends_and_i_found_underground/,"Hey Redditors. Iv'e decided to share my story. Iv'e always been fascinated by breaching security, exploring things or secrets that weren't available to other people. Both in computers and physical matters. This is my story so please enjoy it.

I don't know if this really belongs on short stories, since it's not a fictional story, but I thought you guys might find it interesting.


**TL;DR**
Some friends and i discovered unknown secret tunnels under our high school. Over weeks we discovered and mapped out a big part of the tunnel system. 


[WHOLE PHOTOALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/wCbdH)

I'm now 18 and only have memories and pictures to look back at. 
Last school year (2011/2012) I was an exchange student in USA, Wisconsin. (I'm from Denmark). Btw best year iv'e ever had, with lifelong friendships made. I returned home to Denmark 7 months ago, and started school. This happened exactly one year ago. 

It all started with a friend of mine (senior at the time) came to me and said he had something crazy to tell me. It was kind of a rush hour so i didn't have time to stop and listen. Later that day we met in lunch break and he told me that he had been in the schools maintenaince room and had seen a dark square (3x3 ft) in the wall down a staircase. He that it was some kind of underground tunnel system under the school. I thought he was stupid and didn't think much about it. 
Now in the school i attended for a year and the daily routine consisted of normal classes and a 9th hour/homeroom in the end of the day, where it was possible to study or do your homework. The class was from 3:00 to about 3:40. 

I forgot all about his  little tunnel story and almost two weeks went by till we came by the subject again. I was sitting peacefully in 9th hour and doing my homework when i saw someone knocked on the door. I looked up and there was my friend, lets call him Christian. Christian had excitement in his eyes and he did a throw with his hand plus a nod with his head to signal, that I should come out. I asked the teacher if i could go to the bathroom quick. (At this school you could get in trouble if you walked in the hallway without a pass for the restroom or wherever you were going) 
He wrote me a pass and I walked silently but determined out. Christian basically bombed me with the information that he had been ""in the tunnels"". I thought he was being crazy again and laughed at him, but he kept explaining the whole thing precisely and trustworthy and I started believing him more and more. My eye slid down to his knees and palms and I was soon to discover a enormous amount of dust and dirt on them. The tip of his shoes had some on them as well as he had been crawling somewhere. 

A few days later I couldn't help my curiosity. I had to see if this was true. In 9th hour I got a pass to go to the restroom and knowing I had limited time i rushed down the long hallways with a friend to the mechanical maintenance room. I quickly entered, put on a flashlight on my phone and started searching the big dark room for unknown enterings or exits. Two minutes after my friend had to leave of fear from getting caught by one of the janitors that could walk in any second and get our butts in trouble. I took me 15 minutes, but finally, down a staircase, down a ladder, into what seemed like a small pool around 7 ft deep, in the corner was a little square entering. I could barely spot it with my phone light. I crawled down and had a quick peek inside. After this i was eager to crawl in and look, but i had already been gone for 20 minutes, and i knew that would only cover for a long toilet visit, and I went back to the classroom. At this point I was hooked. No matter what I did, or when I did it, for the next 24 hours, this was permanently on my mind. I was curious and excited to figure this thing out. 

[Entering](http://imgur.com/a/wCbdH#M5Sg1EM)


The next day I couldn't wait for 9th hour. The day went by so slow and it seemed like forever till the class started. Thinking that the teacher wouldn't write me a pass if i asked to go to the restroom right after a 6 minutes break, I waited. at 3:20 i got my pass, rushed to the maintenance room, ran down the stairs, down the ladder in to the pool and went in the tunnel. I had asked Christian to meet me there at 3:20. He showed up and told me that he actually didn't go in that hole, but in another path about 6 ft long that went into the basement in the other side of the room. 
I checked it out and it wasn't even a path, more just like a whole into the basement. We went over to the path i discovered and peeked in. It was a 3x3 ft hole going in as far as we could see. I jumped in first and Christian after and we started crawling on hands and knees in the dark. We were soon to discover turns in the tunnel everywhere. 
Everytime we took a right or left turn there were turns both ways, and the path would always end up in to seperate ways. Shortly after, due to physical requirements, excitement and a crapload of dust and dirt in the air, it got really hard to breath in there, and we went out. Up in the normal school light we were sweaty, and covered with an orangy dust powder.

[Christian](http://i.imgur.com/pN9vCym.jpg)

We had to see more. But we needed to plan it out. We couldn't just go to the restroom every day and coming back looking like we attended World War II. Teachers would get suspicious, and the risk of getting caught was too high. Therefore we went back to class and made a shopping list of what we needed. Same day we took a trip to Walmart and got the necessary things. Flashlights, kneepads, gloves, painting masks for dust, camera, change of clothing, blueprints and pencils. I managed to steal a whole block of passes so we could fake signatures and write passes to study hall, library or other teachers classrooms to cover up our actions.
Also we needed a different time to enter, and a different way to get out. 
We came up with bringing a mirror to look around the edges when we exited the room. 
In the school there was a red blueprint painting hanging in the wall. I took a snapshot of it and after 15 minutes with my enormously bad photoshop skills i made it black and white and printed some copies out. 

[Blueprint we drew on](http://i.imgur.com/b9EKbhe.jpg)

We were now ready to note every single little turn we explored under there. We also got two other friends involved, and we created a hidden closed Facebook group for us. 

[We were PROJECT BELOWSCHOOL](http://i.imgur.com/f87aNSE.jpg)

Friday night there was a basketball game at the school. 
What a perfect opportunity. School was open and no one in the hallways. We packed bags from home. Once the game was on, we four friends snuck into the maintenance room, and into the tunnel. We equipped all of our gear and began our journey. We had a lead guy at front, a flashlight guy, a map writer and a camera guy at the end. We had also purchased 1000 ft of line that we tied somewhere in the maintenance room. and took with us in. It functioned as a kind of safety so we always could find our way out. After almost 2 hours in there. We went out. We had discovered endless turns and paths and about 700 ft of tunnel was mapped down. 

[Underground](http://i.imgur.com/RyDQacv.jpg)

The following fridays we planned to go down there again. We knew the routine, once the game started we snuck in the tunnel and started our mapping. We took a whole new section of the school every time. We could hear and calculate due to the game when we were under the gym, the cafeteria, classrooms and and all the other rooms. I'm a big guy 6'4"", and i had quite some trouble crawling around down there. One of the times i was freaking out because I was running (as good as possible down there) and I got breathless because of the dust. After that I never did anything physical exhausting while in the tunnels. 

We went down there about four times and the last time was the most interesting. It was only me and Christian, and we decided to explore the left side of the school. On our way down the tunnels we saw writing on the walls. It looked like someone made arrows down there. There was also a few cigarette butts and some cans of some kind. 

[Hardees cup](http://i.imgur.com/andGS3I.jpg)

[Cans](http://i.imgur.com/DmrT9WM.jpg)

We continued and saw a yellow pipe running across the path. We spend about 5 minutes discussing what it was, but it seemed like the answer came to us. All of a sudden two girly voices got exceptionally clear. We looked at the blueprints and our position fit perfectly under the girls restroom. The voices were clear and we were sure we were just a few feet under the restroom. Even the footsteps were clear through the floor. We sat there for about 10 minutes enjoying our achievement, but then decided to keep going. (We weren't able to see anything)
We continued into a big wide space. The feeling of standing up for the first time in three hours was amazing. It was exactly under the staircase. There was a metal plate in the wall, and we recognized it from the hallways. 

[Under the staircase](http://i.imgur.com/0hM84eA.jpg)

[Metal plate 1](http://i.imgur.com/gkYteFf.jpg)

[Metal plate 2](http://i.imgur.com/HLApYWx.jpg)

We had found another entering. Unfortunately it was locked. We also looked up in a hole with a bunch some pipes and wires and discovered a bag of funions shoved up in there. How the heck did these come up there? We took a few pictures and took the 25 minute journey crawling all the way out. We jumped through the little hole to the basement and exit through there. No one saw us. Monday morning we went above ground of where we were on the friday. We looked down the thermostat of a radiator and concluded that the bag of funions were down there, most likely shoved down from above.

[Bag of funions](http://i.imgur.com/iLvE1F4.jpg) 

The basketball season ended a few days after there.
Even though we talked a lot about going back, we didn't To this day i still regret not finished the mapping down there.
Later on we explored some abandoned buildings and train wagons, but nothing gave me the same adrenalin kick as these tunnels. We talked about them to my friends father who knew a janitor on the school. He told us that these were quite common tunnels in every high school design. They were made to access all the heat, and water pipes running to all the classrooms. After some research we found people all over America that had discovered these tunnels too. I guess in the end they weren't that secret and exciting, but I got my rush from them. We told a few people about it and showed them the pictures, but it's kind of forgotten to this day. Only my memories and pictures keeps this alive.

Here are the whole picture album. Unfortunately I didn't take enough photos, this is all I have.
Iv'e decided to hide our identity since I haven't asked or have got their permission to post their faces. I am the guy with the blue gloves.

So I tore it down. By myself. With a good chunk of my expendable funds, I rented a miniature bulldozer and spent eleven hours obliterating my quaint but shallow abode.

It cost me all but what was in my pocket to stay at a cheap motel for the next two weeks while I tirelessly built a log cabin the way my father had.

I had hoped it would be my mothers. His bifocals were constantly sliding down that pointy nose, and I could tell he was nervous from the constant smoothing of the stringy hair around his ears. Several emotions flickered across his face at once: fear, joy, excitement, jealousy. The last made me uncomfortable, and I shifted under the large man’s eager stare.

“Well… what did you see?” he asked, rubbing his forehead with a handkerchief. His voice was higher than normal; normal being already slightly feminine. The others in the room stared expectantly, pen and paper ready in each pair of hands. Reporters, news camera crews, journalists, and anyone else who wanted exclusive information was jammed into the already cramped room. If I had more of an ego, I may have enjoyed the attention. Perhaps even more so if I had anything to tell them.

They thought I was the perfect candidate, considering my experience. Every trip to the past had included me, either on my own or accompanying a person or group. They thought that I was good luck. I knew better, knew that I was the opposite. The first time, I had caught cholera, and had nearly died in Nottingham. The second, a stray Mongol arrow had all but pierced my heart. The rest are a jumble of disease, famine, natural disasters, and war casualties. Each time, as I was about to die, I was brought back to the present and the ailment cured. They told me it was worth it, for science and history. None of them ever volunteered to join me.

If it hadn't been news of the meteor, I may have continued my disastrous missions into history. It had been kept quiet at first, but news leaked out, as it always does. People began to panic, rioters hit the streets, and religious extremists gained billions of followers. Of course, nobody knew if the meteor would actually hit; it all depended on the timing. Either a direct collision, pulled by our gravity, or else it will pass extremely close and shoot towards the sun. Impossible to tell.
Then the director had his brilliant plan; if we could see the past, why not the future?  In the state of panic, everybody jumped on board. The director became a sort of celebrity, and funding was raised quickly. And who better, he asked, to lead this mission, but the one who had been a part of all previous missions. I tried to oppose, of course, but they wouldn't hear it. I was going.

I knew all along there was nothing to be seen. Even as they were inputting the coordinates, I was trying to decide what to say. You cannot predict the future; you cannot know it, because it does not yet exist. There are many possibilities, many different ways it could run. Astrologists and prophets appear successful, because they predict the most likely outcome, and brag intelligence or giftedness when it comes about. But there was no likely outcome, no easily discernible pattern to follow. It was one or the other, left or right, death or life. Heads or tails.

I glanced down, as the face of George Washington stared mockingly up at me. With a practiced smile and show of relief, I proclaimed that we would survive; the meteor will pass close enough that offshoots will create much damage, but Earth will remain intact.

Celebratory whoops and hollers filled the room, and the director did something of a dance. I smiled, shaking hands and giving hugs as everyone came to congratulate me. There was no happiness, no excitement, as I wait until the day the meteor would arrive. If I were to be honest with myself, I hope it hits us.

The walls of my den seem closer in tonight. I swirl the amber liquid in my glass. How long have I been in here? All night it seems. I look down at the typewriter; a few sentences written, nothing substantial. The dim light shines off the bottle on the side table. *Wasn’t there was more left?* I think. These long nights really do me in. I hear steps behind me. “Writer’s block, honey?” my wife asks.

“How could you tell?” I ask, giving her a slight smile as I turn in my chair.

“Well, for one, the whiskey’s almost gone,” she replies, smiling back. “I thought that was fuel for you writers?” she questions.

“Maybe for Joyce and them,” I say, holding the bottle in my hand, the glass heavy and cool in my hands. “But for me, apparently whiskey is nothing more than an escape.”

“An escape?” she questions, her tone becoming more serious. “What are you escaping from, Walter?”

I give a heavy sigh.  “Myself mostly; my thoughts, my fears that my writing will never be what it was, that the well I drew from so many times has dried up.” 

She walks over and puts her arms around me in an attempt to be comforting, but I find it agitating, and I shrug her off. Whiskey is my only comfort tonight, and so I pour another glass. 

She shakes off my cold demeanor. “You’re a fantastic writer, Walter, ever since I've known you. Remember those nights where we would lie in bed, and you would read to me, read your stories and poems? I know how well you can write.”

I lean back in my chair and I remember back to those days she mentioned. Things were different back then. The writing was different, my outlook was different, and our relationship was different. “But what if I can’t get back to that? What if that’s gone forever?” I ask, superficially about my writing, but implying things much deeper.

She looks at me for a moment, looking as though she’s trying to read the thoughts behind my eyes. “It’s late; why don’t you come to bed?”

“I can’t, I can’t leave without writing something worth keeping on the page.”

She seems disheartened by my answer. “Well, write about something you know; you always said that helped you get through writer’s block.”

“Yeah, I’ll try that, thanks honey,” I reply, giving her a hollow smile.

She walks up to bed, and I position myself in my chair. I finish the remainder of my glass, and I unscrew the bottle. I take sizable swig of the writer’s fuel. Write about something I know, I think. I look at what’s prevalent, pressing in my life, and my fingers move to the typewriter and hammer out a sentence.

**He no longer loved her.**

I look at my sentence, and I sob. I grab the writer’s fuel, and I escape.

The game was called “Don’t shit a brick.” The goal was to see who could doggy paddle the longest while holding a brick. Juvenile, sure. Was it fun? You’re damn right it was.


Jennifer had cried out with glee when she first entered the water, then her face squished in like a sponge when she was handed the brick. She momentarily grimaced as the red, clay brick scraped against her inner thigh. But she managed to hold onto it surrounded by the vibrantly colored speedboats of her classmates.


Her red and blue bikini top was fastened tight around her neck, but the grasping texture of the brick threatened to expose her sun shaded breasts to the boys leaning off the sides of their boats, cheering wildly like she was crossing the finish line with each minor stroke.


The coldness of Lake Holshire had sucked my breath away earlier in the afternoon, when the first round of tubing had begun.  The coldness could be seen on Jennifer’s face, in the way she gasped for air and kept her eyes focused on one spot in the sky.


Maybe if we had brought more than one brick, the contestant would have felt better about dropping it to the mossy bottom below. As it were, Jennifer struggled with the weight and the beers she had drank earlier.


She managed to keep herself afloat as someone yelled, “She looks like she’s shitting a brick!”


The three speedboats all had their engines killed and their anchor points tethered, leaving a triangular opening in the water. As Jennifer struggled with her clay weight, the boats sloshed and shimmied so that Jennifer was no longer in the center of the triangle, but closer to Davis’ boat, a shining red and black beast that could hit sixty miles an hour without blinking.


I yelled to Davis, “Get her out, man. She’s finished.”


He didn’t even look at me, but kept staring down at the top of her breasts that glistened just above the surface of the water.


In the afternoon sun, the water was a navy blue, like the oppressive folds of storm clouds about to spit rain.


Davis was now laying on the edge of his Mastiff, as he called the red and black racer, urging Jennifer to just give up and take her top off. She didn’t need to be weighed down by it. Her faux laugh filled her mouth with Lake water, which she spit out with squinting eyes.


“Shut up, Dave,” was all she managed to mouth before slipping under water.


Davis turned to Trev, “Did you hear what she said?” He didn’t see her submerge into the triangle of darkness, like a pole searching for the bottom of Lake Holshire.


The water rippled outwards where the crown of her head had gone under, breaking symmetry on the side of the Mastiff. One, two, three seconds pass. No sign of her. She’s not coming up. I search the black water to see if I can find her, but cannot.


I glance at the others. There’s more than a dozen people and not one of them seems concerned that Jennifer has just taken the plunge to death. She’s a caught bobber and no one wants to reel her in.


Alcohol does dumb shit to people.


I dive in, momentarily wondering if I should have jumped in feet first rather than swan dive into the water. But I don’t hit her. I open my eyes and am amazed at how bright it is underwater. The boats cast long shadows down a corridor of the lake, but there’s wide expanses receiving bright sunlight now. I can see Jennifer with her eyes closed about ten feet below.


She is drifting there like a person caught between a dream and waking. She’s let go of the brick but her hands still hold it near her chest. Something in the water brushes against my eyelids causing them to close momentarily. I fear she’ll be dead when I get her in my arms. Will she drift away when I’m back?


I reach her, grab her underneath her arms and start kicking for the surface. I can see the long angular shadows from the boats spread wider and wider, until I’m panting above the dark expanse of the black triangle.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1348250370.0,,,True,t3_108wl1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/108wl1/black_triangle/,

A brunette holds a handful of cut straws. A group of girls shy away before reaching out to claim their own. They all pull one of the neon plastic tubes out of the cluster, and I reluctantly follow suit. My reluctance doesn’t result of fear, but a faintly disinterest in the proceedings. The Walk, like most of Patty’s designs, is the result of a night of light drinking and the need to always have some new idea that everyone else will just think wildly entertaining. 

“Annalise, you drew the short straw.”  

“I,” the sentence is started before I glance down to compare the length of my own straw to that of everyone else’s’. “I suppose I did.” A light shrug falls off my shoulders. The whole game seems silly to me, and I’m not worried to have lost the draw. 

Patty walks to the sofa where her purse sits to pull out a long strip of cloth. “Blindfold time, Annalise.” 

Rebecca takes the length of blue cotton off her hands and closes the distance between us with a few awkward steps. I turn my back to her and tie my hair in a ponytail. The other girls watch with interest. This is the first time I have actively participated in any of the games that didn’t involve drinking. Everything goes dark as the knot cinches at the back of my head. 

“Can you see anything?” Patricia asks the question, presumably from her previous position at the other side of the room, and I simply shake my head in response. 

“Then let’s go. Unless you’re afraid of the dark.” 

A biting retort reaches my lips and I hold it down, reminding myself that these aren’t the girls from my previous school. As far as I know, it a friendly taunt, and not a subtle way to intimidate me.  In an attempt to just be friendly a smile spreads across my lips and I shake my head.

“Not afraid of the dark, but maybe this will be different.”

Someone, most likely Tracy, judging by the small size of the hand grasping my elbow, guides me towards the door. 

“Just count to twenty, and then walk.” Tracy’s voice sounds by my ear and I inwardly congratulate myself on my excellent guess.

The 6 girls take off in different directions, footsteps giving away their positions at first, but quickly fading away until I’m left with just the numbers sounding in my head. I count slowly, determined to play this silly game with as much seriousness as I can muster. If I am being completely honest, The Walk seems mostly like an initiation into this new group. The fact that we drew straws is my only consolation that this wasn’t some form of twisted setup. Once again I remind myself that these girls are followers of Patty’s whims, and not the gossiping malicious one I left behind when I transferred. 

A deep breath fills my lungs with the cool fall air, and I can almost feel the full moon shining down. Of course, that’s all in my imagination, but without my vision it’s running wild. I take the first step off the porch and slowly walk forward. A rustle of leaves to my right catches my attention and I quickly turn my head in that direction, tripping a bit as I do so. Obviously my brain has forgotten that I’m blindfolded. The uncertainty of the situation nags at my anxiety, but I take another deep breath to calm myself. 

 “It’s just a game.” An inner mantra begins repeating itself, but is quickly abandoned as I struggle to figure out what’s going on around me without eyes. 

A scream dashes through the air, ending as quickly as it began .It was convincing, but I know better. 

“That’s really funny, girls. Scream all you want, I’m not scared.” 

There’s no response to my announcement, and I smile widely. So that’s how they want to play this. I should have known that a simple walk through the woods wasn’t all Patty had planned for whoever drew the short straw. 

Another scream, much like the first, cuts through the air. It’s followed by the sound of a person crashing through the forest. The smile remains spread across my face as I keep walking, these girl’s are going above and beyond to scare me. 

“Patty, oh my god, Patty!” Rebecca’s distressed voice reaches my ears, and for the first time I a m a little bit worried. 

More screams and the sound of running fill the air until I can’t even hear the leaves under my own feet. 

“Annalise, take off your blindfold, there’s someone-“ the sentence is torn short by another scream. I know the rules though. The blindfold must stay in place until someone comes to you and pulls it off, signaling that I have successfully completed the walk. I don’t even reach upwards, determined not to fall for their tricks.   

The screaming eventually quiets down, one girl at a time and I struggle to keep my footing and my breath. At some point I started running. My legs and arms burn with scrapes and cuts from the branches I had encountered. I hadn’t realized how scared I actually was until I stopped running and realized that the only sound was that of a light fall breeze, creeping through the trees. 

“Patty?” 

No response.

“Patty, this isn’t funny anymore. Can I take off the blindfold?” 

Still no response. I know that I’ll never hear the end of it for chickening out, but that doesn’t matter anymore. A deep fear gripped me, as irrational as it was, and I need to see what was happening around me, I need to be reminded that this was just a game. 

My finger pulls at the knot holding the blindfold on and it eventually falls to the ground at my feet. I blink several times, getting used to seeing again as someone approaches me from the left.  I turn to see Emily, the quietest of Patty’s followers, covered in blood with a knife in one hand, and Rebecca’s head in the other. 

A twisted smile. A knife covered in blood. A terrified girl running away through the woods.

She had noticed that certain pieces of clothing had gone missing over the past few weeks, and wanted to make sure it didn’t happen again today. Hurridly, she grabbed the remaining garments and stuffed them into the basket, until the line hung empty.

Her friends, when told about the missing clothes, had all critisized her on her use of a clothesline in lieu of a modern drying machine. Anna had replied that she didn’t have the money to buy a dryer, and honestly didn’t want one, as the clothesline did the job just fine for free. However, the missing clothes were beginning to make her think about changing her mind.

Tossing the laundry on the bed, she busied herself with sorting and folding the various shirts, pants, and undergarments. Sure enough, something new was missing. A pair of jeans that she had just recently bought, and was quite fond of. Exasperation set in as she shoved the clothes into their drawers. Of all the things I have around here to steal, why my clothes?

Back outside, Anna carefully approached where the clothesline was. Perhaps, she figured, there might be a few footprings, or other incriminating clues, as to the culprit responsible. Unfortunately, grass grew under and all around the wash area. Her entire property, for that matter, was green.

Anna turned to walk back inside, nearly tripping over a sleeping dog. She glared.

“Tony, you really could bark every once in a while, you know, if you see anything. Those were my favorite jeans.”

The dog lifted his head, blinking slowly, then smiled with his tongue hanging out. Anna rolled her eyes, then made her way back inside the house.

Tony could hear her opening and closing drawers and cubboards, on the off-chance she had misplaced her missing garments. He put his head back in his paws, and licked his chops.

I hate the drops. Drops were the worst. The idea behind performing these “tactical insertion operations” is to “selectively disrupt enemy production capability” but most of us jarheads just think of it as a bug stomp. We drop in near a bug hive and kill everything we see, preferably, while the main swarm is off fighting something else, than jump out. Word from intel said that the main swarm was on the move to southern ridge of our base. They had already eaten their way through Camp Eagle and Camp Limley here on Typhon and were itching for a third meal and, since we were the last remnants of Limley, we were tagged with the “opportunity” as Lt. Korvic calls it. So here we were in the APOD-33, me and seven of my buddies jammed in tighter than a porn stars cooze at a gang bang. The only thing that could make it better would be if a flock of Muta’s showed up while we were flying over the canyons. They look like worms with wings, worms that shoot bug bullets out of there asses. I’ve seen these bullets, these “glaive worms” as the brain boys like to call them, make swiss cheese out of the AAV-5 tanks so I could only imagine what they’d do to the APOD. Korvic would love that. I’d probably enjoy it to just to see Korvic’s face as we go down in her precious ship. Bitch. I can’t rag on her though; she keeps the boys alive and is our ride out of here should the shit hit the fan. 

Dawn is hitting the eastern side of the ship. Drop time is coming up soon. I bark the command to perform pre-drop prep. Each of my guys reads out the HUD on their medical conditions then they start their own suit diagnostics followed by weapons checks. All of this information is relayed back to my suit which I pass on to Korvic. This was all done prior to loading up but you can never be too sure. I amble my way up to the bow and glance at the windows. It looked completely bright outside but I knew that it really wasn’t. I don’t understand the whole technology behind it but it had something to do with the ships sensors and VR displays or some nonsense.  I could see the hive in the distance, once I focused on it my HUD began restating our mission objectives and highlighting key spots to target. I still haven’t gotten used to seeing these things even after three years in the corps, which, considering the life span of a marine is a long time. A skyscraper made of bruised flesh and bone, once the ship optics focused in you could see that it was crawling with the worm larva. The Intel geeks say that the larvas are “genetically versatile” which meant that they could become almost anything in the swarm, if the right conditions were met. I reminded Korvic to scan the area for any of the growths in the area as a result of those conditions. They say that the growths are similar to tumor. Once the Zerg get wind of opposition around there turf they immediately make some kind of virus which infects one of there worker bugs.  Once the worker bug is ready it becomes a growth feeding off their creep and other shit around the area. The tumor forces the larva to become bigger, badder bugs. They say it’s some kind of “immunal response” from the hive like how white blood cells attack infections in the human body. I don't pretend to understand it, all I know is that blowing up the tumor buildings, yeah buildings, stops them from making meaner bugs. At the base of the hive were cocoons, which lord only knows what was growing inside of them. With my luck it'd be Ultras, big, fanged and armored bastards that could tear through ten marines in a single swipe. Korvic didn't scan any radioactive deposits in the area but I wouldn't rule them out either. The Ultras eat rad deposits or some shit like that and is a strong sign that Ultras might be nearby. West of the hive was our target area, the mineral mines. 

Korvic’s telling me that conditions look good. We managed to avoid the max range of there Overlords, the bug eyes in the sky, and the ones hovering near our dropzone were dispatched by Vike’s on an earlier skirmish. SATCOM says Zerg hadn’t had time to replenish their number in this area with the exception of a few hundred drones.  We would be going in undetected to the mines and kill all the drones, no drones no minerals. No minerals no bugs. Simple. I shout at my crew, not that it’s necessary, the audio in our armor can filter out the background noise of the ship, but to get them pissed and ready. I remind them what the bugs have done to us, how they are eating everything they see and that they want to be the toughest sons of bitches in the universe. I remind them that once they hit the four year mark they’ll be pardoned and that all the pussy in the universe will love them and thank them for their service. I see glassy eyes and hear grunts and howls. I can tell Korvic’s pinged there suits for stims. We descend very suddenly, then immediately slow, the APOD is in its vertical take-off state. Korvic and the pilot hit it just right; we are only 10 meters above our DZ. I hear a small compressed whine within my suit. Korvic’s started my stims. As the ramp opens I can see the men stand, helmets closing on their faces, almost foaming at the mouth as the stims take effect. The dawn light hits us and I remember how I came to the corps, how I killed all of those people and that I’m only a year away from my pardon. Why would I want to leave? I can’t give this up. I don't even need the stims to kill. I sight in on the helpless worker bugs, pull the trigger and smile.

His face, a map of scars, was strangely familiar, like a distant place long forgotten.

""Speak not in riddles old man,"" I snarled, ""You will make your peace with to whomever gods you pray well soon enough. Until then, you answer to Me, and pray, pray now, my vengeance is kinder than theirs.""

His sunken eyes shone dimly, and bore no fear. ""Then I truly hope my debt to them is paid,"" he laughed, wistful.

""Tell me, what did you wish of them, Barabbas? What shining stone did you cheat from the Wardens' lot? What coveted prize did you squander on stolen time? What dungeon's claim did you lay away on halcyon roads? Was it Love? Riches? Power? Tell me. Tell me before I send you back to the hell from whence you came, wretched man.""

""I sought something. I think... I sought knowledge. Understanding.""

""Then you are a fool, old one. Tell me, out of perversion, what did you learn, living out your wasted days? What carnival spectacles did the wilds divulge, as you wandered far and away? What secrets did the amber halls and dim-lit alleys whisper to prowling ears? What shrouded facts sought their way through dead tomes, spilling torrid wanderlust into grey matter? Was it Techne? Logos? Pathos? Teach me. Teach me, before I snuff out your pathetic spark.""

He took a deep breath and exhaled, a visible shudder traveling through his frail skeleton. I saw his eyes glimmer distantly. I saw him strain, the furrows of his brow crossed in wrought exertion. I watched his frail hand reach across the distance between us, stretching as if to grasp something unfathomable and then, a solitary tear fell onto the cold ground.

""I cannot... I can no longer remember. I am old and my mind is not what it once was.""

He closed a pair of weary eyes and hung a tired head, anguish painted across his worn features.

""Once a fool, always a fool, I can see,"" I spat, seizing his slacking jaw, and peering into cloudy eyes, a visage of sorrow. ""Tell me your story. Show me your sins. Show me your joys and regrets, your dreams and sorrows. Show me it all, the last thing you do before these damned eyes are shut forevermore. SHOW ME!""

Silence. Grimacing, he forced his eyes shut, face a contortion of singular will, summoning every scrap of concentration he could gather. 

Time stood still.

Then, suddenly, his eyes sprang open and the clouds parted within revealing a sudden inner light, a clear and piercing gaze. His brow lifted, his focus sharpened and a sudden strength found itself within him, wresting my hand away.

Hands astir, he gripped my hands, arms, and face frantically, some terrible recognition dawning over him. Clasping my head with his palms, he suddenly collapsed onto the ground, drained.

""Speak, you despicable thing! Tell me your name! Speak, damn you!"" I growled, anxious to hear his last words. Crouching, I knelt beside his haggard frame.

He spoke, after a time, eyes aglow with perception. His words were slow and deliberate. This is what he told me.

""You... I remember my wish. I wished to know an old man’s secret, once. My name is... but, ah! that, you know already. Let me teach you what I have learned. Let me show you, eager one.”

And he smiled, a wry smile, breathing his last.

You're not even sure why you came, your friends said you had to get out of the house for a while. They were ""worried about you"". Apparently it's possible in todays society to spend too much time alone. 

Even before everything happened you were a solitary man. Not awkward as such, you just happen to prefer your own company most of the time. There was talk of autism in school, borderline personality disorder, major depression. The list goes on, even to this day.

Your friends herd you over to the bar offering a night of cost free ablution or if not ablution, then at least forgetting. Do you want to forget? Could you live without the memories? Would you be the same? 

You cheers the group, forcing a smile onto your face. Pulling out another mask to hide behind. The one used most often. ""Happy""

They take turns buying you drinks, trying to get you involved in a few little jokes. You can always make them laugh without trying. They seem to think this means you're brightening up. You do nothing to dispel this illusion. 

It's loud here. You're uncomfortable but the mask makes it easy to hide. Plus the affects of the alcohol are becoming stronger, perhaps it's time for a cigarette?

Outside now. The air is crisp and you can see your breath after the smoke has left your lungs. This amuses you for some reason and for a split second a real smile shows through.

Footsteps in the alley behind you. You turn. You don't know this man who is standing so close to you. He looks upset. You feel a warmth in your stomach. Perhaps this man is known to you after all.

It sparkles under all that cold rain, and I’m in love.  My cigarette smoke collects under the awning in a cloud as I exhale, and the chilly winter air suddenly filling my lungs stings in contrast.  Behind me, I can hear the faint clink of glasses and soft murmurs between friends or lovers (or, both, maybe, if they’re lucky) escaping from the open door of the café out of which I’ve just stepped.  The warm, golden light spills onto the sidewalk next to me and calls me back inside, but nothing is more inviting than the city in the rain.  Icy water is beginning to seep through the soles of my heels (I wore them for you, you know) and the warm tears that have collected in the corners of my eyes, and which are now sliding down my cheeks, suddenly feel scalding.  Soon I’ll drop my cigarette onto the wet sidewalk and extinguish the ash with the toe of my now-ruined shoes, thumb the hot tears away, square my shoulders and turn back to the café to finish telling you goodbye. Goodbye to you, because I can’t say goodbye to this city. Because you are too silly to stay, and the city in the rain is too beautiful to leave.

I woke up and glanced at the clock to the side of me. 5:30. I never woke up that early. Even for school. I felt, different, though, somehow. Like I was being watched. Like I was in a movie or a book or something. But it was more than that. I was motivated? I guess? That fits well enough. I was motivated. I wanted to do something.
  I slowly got up and started to get ready for school. I dreaded school. I hated most people there, and they hated me back. I honestly don't know why I went. If it was up to me, I wouldn't. It was a big waste of time. I really hated it.
  I was never bad in school, but nothing exceptional either. It wasn't the work though, it was the people. If you were any different than the hive mind you were made an outcast. I wasn't one though. I had a good amount of friends, and knew the right people to not be made fun of, but I just never liked most of the people there. They were cruel and unforgiving. I didn't like them.
  So you're probably wondering why I still went? Well like many people, it was because of Her. I never knew her name, only what she looked like. She was amazing, but she hated me. I only still went to school because I thought I would have a chance of her not hating me. If I just had a chance to talk to her, or something, maybe she wouldn't hate me, like many people do. 
  I honestly don't know why I'm telling anyone this. Nobody cares. But I don't mind. I don't care. I've been told countless times that I could never get her. Or anyone, for that matter. But I didn't care. I kept trying.
 Again, I know nobody cares, but this is my story. And I'm going to tell it for once.
  I went to school, again dreading it. The day wasn't anything special. I went to my classes, nothing more, nothing less. The worst part about school I think was how uneventful it always was.
  Anyway one thing did happen today, I talked to her. It turns out, she doesn't hate me, just never bothered to talk to me.

Part 2
  
He talked to me today! I couldn't believe it! Then, after I got over the shock, I felt so idiotic for not saying more. For not saying ""I think I love you"" or at least ""Can we be friends?"" All I could manage was ""H-h-hi."" Imbecile. Now he'll never know that I can't stop thinking about him and probably never will. Now he'll never know that I think he's amazing. And he'll certainly never, ever know that someone, even if it's just me, needs him. 
  School was......school. I mean, I was pretty intelligent, I suppose. Made pretty good grades. But where does that get you in life? Further than most people think, but that's the point. The people who decide your social standing are highly unqualified to do so. But do I care? Not in the slightest. I'm not disliked. I'm friendly with pretty much everyone, but mainly, I'm not noticed at all, really. I'm not bothered by that. Trust me, most people at my school, you wouldn't want to notice you, either. The one thing that drove me crazy was that he didn't notice me. At least, I thought he didn't for awhile. 
  Once, I heard from a friend who heard from a friend who heard him talking about suicide. I doubted he'd talk about it, but I didn't doubt he'd do it. This scared me. I realized I didn't exactly have a lot of time to tell him anything really. I had to force myself into his life. Honestly, I could care less if the whole world hated me. But not him. Please, not him. 
  The reason I liked him was because you could tell by looking at him that he understood you. Not necessarily everyone, but I knew he'd understand me. I knew that maybe I could be someone he liked. I hoped I could be someone he loved. I just didn't know how to tell him.

Looking around, the car was immaculate to the point of obsession. Each item in its appropriate place was just begging to be disturbed. My sister sat beside me, silent and restless, as I fought off an intensifying urge to do something irrational. Our cassette tape had ended long ago and the resulting silence tormented my already listless mind. The cloying smell of antiquated perfume hung stagnant in the air, and the skin on my right arm was baking in the sun and making my blue jeans begin to burn my leg.

For the hundredth time, my eyes scanned the familiar house looming before me. The paint that now peeled and bubbled off the crudely built wooden frame had been pure white at one time, but was now a defiled mushroom beige. Two gaping curtainless windows gazed down at me with an air of secrecy and disgrace. The garage was an open mouth, inviting me to enter and learn its mysteries. I stared and imagined what it would be like inside, having only familiarized myself with its outer shell. And I waited.

My sister and I visited our grandmother, Amma, about once a week. Our usually monotonous visits would sometimes be interrupted by a spontaneous trip to Uncle George’s house. Uncle George was Amma’s brother only by marriage. His wife had recently passed away, however, leaving Uncle George incapable of doing even the most insignificant of domestic undertakings. Amma quickly and readily stepped in to assist the incompetent man at his every request. My sister and I were taken along at instances like these and were given explicit instructions to remain in the car. “I’ll only be a second,” Amma would tell us in an uncharacteristically hurried manner. “Just wait here and I’ll be right back.”

My sister’s foot kept tapping the back of the driver side seat in front of her. Up and down it went, as if this one extremity of hers was the only part of her body that remained alive. Tap, tap, tap, tap it went. My arm seared in the heat. That house was staring, taunting. Tap, tap. The sickly sweet fragrance made it difficult to concentrate. Tap, tap, tap. My overactive seven year old mind was an explosion of troubled anxiety. It had been too long. This was getting ridiculous. How can she expect this from us? Tap, Tap, tap, tap… I turned to my sister and immediately she saw the resolution on my face. She stared open mouthed as I gently opened the car door and stepped out onto the cracked gray driveway. “Don’t worry, I’ll be right back.”

My stomach was a rock within me and at each step my feet felt like lead. I stopped and took one last look up at that grotesque staring face with the gaping mouth, then I entered the garage. I walked slowly, unsurely. Each common object I encountered seemed exotic to my nervous eyes. There was a doorway in the shadows up ahead, painted with the same sour yellowed paint. The entrance into the very bowels of the house. My hand was sweaty on the gold doorknob, but I quietly turned it and entered.

Immediately the odor of dust, unwashed linen, and old age filled my nostrils. Fingers still on the doorknob, my first instinct was to recoil in fear and repulsion. I took a deep, putrid breath. I needed to know what was going on. At the end of the long hallway I saw a thin sliver of harsh florescent light cast onto the wall from the adjacent room. I could hear someone inside. As I walked along the wall, a growing sense of trepidation filled my small body. I shouldn’t be in here. I was going to get caught. I neared the opening from which the glaring light was coming, and hesitantly peered in.

What I saw was a standard laundry room. Lint covered button-down shirts hung from hangers on a clothesline to dry, while neat stacks of folded slacks lined the top of the dingy grey dryer. A blue plastic hamper sat on the cement floor holding a jumble of clothes that I assumed were unclean. The air was moist and smelled of mold and powder detergent.

Standing in the middle of the room, however, was the most alarming sight that I had ever witnessed. My Uncle George was stooped beneath the glaring light, putting on a pair of rumpled black dress socks. Those were the only item of clothing he was wearing. His ghost-white skin was a stark contrast to the bleak surroundings. With a naive terror, I looked up the long, gangly legs and over the flat, drooping buttocks. The backbone protruded under loose skin and my gaze involuntarily traveled upward as if on some skeletal highway. His extended neck was crowned with a mop of disheveled grey hair that sprung greasy from the pale veined scalp. He was arched over, translucent flesh sagging off the wiry frame like some prehistoric amphibious human being. Claw-like hands were ferociously pulling at the sock on his left foot as he struggled to maintain balance. He had not seen me. With my heart pounding so ferociously that I was sure I’d be caught, I bolted. Shaking with unadulterated horror, I retraced my steps as soundlessly as possible.

Safely back in the car, I waited. My sister questioned, but I couldn’t tell her. When Amma finally returned, I hysterically relayed what I had seen. All at once a look came over her worn face that I couldn’t identify. Fear? Insecurity? Anger? She quickly told me that I had seen nothing and warned me never to tell my mother what I had just described to her. She told me that it was going to be alright. That it would be our little secret. And that we were going for ice cream.

Sixteen years later, the story once again surfaced in my memory. As I relayed it to my astonished mother, the truth was deciphered. Unbeknownst to their family, Amma and my Uncle George were having an affair. What seemed like a considerate sister-in-law helping her less than capable brother was, in reality, a covert sexual escapade begging to be uncovered by the unassuming granddaughter. As the situation was discussed, the pieces fell into place like some sort of perverted relational puzzle. To this day, Amma doesn’t know that we’ve uncovered the disgraceful skeleton in her closet.

You don't look like any girl I've ever seen before.
I couldn't say ""Well she looks just like Jane Fonda, except that she's got red hair, and her mouth is different and of course, she's not a movie star...""
I couldn't say that because you dont look like Jane Fonda at all.
I finally ended up describing you as a movie I saw when I was a child in Tacoma Washington. I guess I saw it in 1941 or 42, somewhere in there. I think I was seven, or eight, or six.
It was a movie about rural electrification, a perfect 1930's New Deal morality kind of movie to show kids. The movie was about farmers living in the country without electricity. They had to use lanterns to see by at night, for sewing and reading, and they didn't have any appliances like toasters or washing machines, and they couldn't listen to the radio. They built a dam with big electric generators and they put poles across the countryside and strung wire over fields and pastures.
There was an incredible heroic dimension that came from the simple putting up of poles for the wires to travel along. They looked ancient and modern at the same time.
Then the movie showed electricity like a young Greek god, coming to the farmer to take away forever the dark ways of his life. Suddenly, religiously, with the throwing of a switch, the farmer had electric lights to see by when he milked his cows in the early black winter mornings. The farmer's family got to listen to the radio and have a toaster and lots of bright lights to sew dresses and read the newspaper by.
It was really a fantastic movie and excited me like listening to the Star Spangled Banner, or seeing photographs of President Roosevelt, or hearing him on the radio ""... the President of the United States... ""
I wanted electricity to go everywhere in the world. I wanted all the farmers in the world to be able to listen to President Roosevelt on the radio.
That's how you look to me.""

She felt a biting cold metallic surface beneath her. She was laying down, in a metal room with only one door; a heavy, solid metal door. The florescent lights: the searing light, buzzing incessantly above her. They were driving her mad. She suddenly felt a pool of warmth beneath her head; blood. It was bleeding. To her relief it was only a slight trickle. To her horror there was a large dried pool of blood below her. A few drops trailed off to the opposite end of the room. And she saw him. 

Lying there on the floor, opposite to her was a man. She saw no blood around him, but saw blood on his hands. Lying between them were a syringe and a keycard. The syringe was empty; what was in it? She wondered. Did he attack me? What is this place? Why am I here? Why can't I remember? She couldn't remember. She couldn't remember anything at all; who she was, where she was, and why she was here. She couldn't remember; and she was afraid. Did he lock me in this room for something I did? Was this man a guard at this facility? Or were this man's intentions more...malignant? She didn't want to know. She wanted to get out; she had to get out. She had to find some answers. 

She stood up and made her way towards the door, still slightly ajar. As she approached the threshold, she noticed a camera. What is this place she thought and what is it for? She left into the hallway, and stared down its sterile walls, glistening in the white light. There were more cells, but there was silence. She was unsure of whether that was a good sign or not. She made for the door at the end of the hallway; it looked different from the rest, perhaps it wasn't a cell, perhaps it was a way out. She hoped it was. When she reached the door, her heart sank; it was locked. 

The key card in the room! It was the only thing she had to go on, the only ray of light in her frightening nightmare. Feeling hopeful, she raced to the end of the hall for the key card. When she reached the cell she had awoken in, she entered and made her way for the card, not noticing that the man had woken up, and was watching her. As she goes to leave the room, she hears an unsettling, animalistic growl. She turns back to see the man, crouching, staring at her with a predator's gaze. Looking closer at his eyes, she notices that his eyes are a yellowish color; like a cat's eyes. His nails had sharpened, and were more like claws. What was in that syringe? Was he planning on doing that to me? 

Suddenly, the feral beast leaped. Thinking quickly, she pulled the door closed just in time. She started to run down the hall and then she heard that noise. The feral creature let out a sickening roar. The nightmarish noise paralyzed her with fear. For an eternity, she could not move, could not think, could not breath. What made her move wasn't fear of the beast behind her. It was the new sounds she heard. The other cells were alive with movement; something was lurking behind their walls. With an ever deepening sense of terror, she ran towards the door, inserted the key card, and turned the handle; the door opened. The minuscule amount of relief she felt was extinguished when she heard the footfalls of the beast. Without even looking, she went through the door and into the new room. She turned and closed the door, seeing the beast lunge forward, more feral in appearance than before, just in time for it to crash into the closed door. She was safe, for now. 

Turning to examine the room, she saw monitors. Monitors that showed the horrors in the other cells. Creatures that lurked and prowled with vicious intent. Creatures that writhed and squirmed in agonizing pain. This facility...was for experimentation on human beings. Just who the hell are these people? What are they doing? What are these vile bastards doing to these poor people? Sitting down, she started to go through some notes lying on the table. They were of someone named Dr. Moreau. This despicable person wrote about these people, his ""patients"" with no empathy, no remorse. He was now one of his own experiments. 

""Doctor, are you there? The Colonel is waiting for the latest results of your testing."" It was a man's voice on the other side of the door opposite from the one with the cells. She sat frozen with fear. What would happen to her when he found out what happened to the doctor, that he had become one of his pets? ""Doctor? I'm coming in..."" The door slowly opened, and a man wearing heavily padded, black colored clothing came in. He was holding a gun. When he stepped into the room, he raised it and fired. At that moment, a life was silenced. 
But it was not hers... 

Lowering his weapon, he turned to her and said, ""Your bleeding, come with me to the infirmary."" When she didn't respond, didn't even breath, he said it. Those words which shattered her utterly and will haunt her for the rest of her days. It was just a simple question, yet it implied so much.

The last words I remember saying.  We were sitting at a table outside a cafe, just having a good conversation, but a part of me just felt like some just wasn't right.  I couldn't do this anymore.  I remember seeing his displeasure as I turned away to leave.  He looked so heartbroken, so vulnerable.  His face tensed at the shock of it all.  It was killing me inside.  Gary's a great guy, but this was for the best.  That's the last thing I remember before everything got dark.

My head hurts.  I'm getting a stabbing pain in my head.

""Wake up.""

A voice.  A foggy, drowned out voice.

""Wake up.  We're going to be late.""

It's cold.  I feel... weak.

""C'mon wake up already.  Boss'll be pissed if we're late again.""

My eyes were openned.  It was Gary.  He's smiling.  He's looking down at me with a gentle stare and a relaxed grin.  He looks... happy.  But where am I?  A single bulb hanging from the stain covered ceiling, dimly lights the bleak room.  The walls decorated with wallpaper with little ducks on them.  Parts of it are peeling though, and some of the molding seems to be falling apart.  I don't remember being here before.

*""Where are we?""* I said.

""Ah there you go.  About time you woke up.  Now we need to get you dressed and well fed or you're going to be cranky all day and complain about how Greg won't shut up about his stupid four year old daughter.""

Did Gary not hear me?

*""Gary, what are we doing here?""* I tried again.

Something's wrong.  Nothing came out.

""I know Greg's an ass, but you can't say that about his daughter.  And I'm pretty sure that's illegal in some states.""

Gary opens a drawer from a nearby dresser.  He picks out a blue and white plaid dress shirt.  It's got a stain on the sleeve.  Possibly from spilt coffee.  He should clean that.

""Here we go.  Your favorite shirt.""

I lost that shirt weeks ago.  Why does Gary have it?

*""Why do you have my shirt?""* I can't move.  Why can't I move?  Something is definitely wrong.

""Now put this on and let's get going.""

I CAN'T MOVE!

Gary sighs...

""Do I have to help you again?  Geez, what would you do without me?""

He sits me up.  There's cardboard under me.  My feet look pale.  My body feels... heavy.

""Oh please.  You didn't have to say that.""  He lifts up my arm and slides it through the sleeve of the dirty shirt.  ""I know you appreciate me.""

This isn't right.  I don't understand any of this.  I can't move.  My head hurts.  WHERE AM I?

""There.  Now you look good as new.""  Gary says as he's finished buttoning up the shirt.  ""See for yourself.""

Gary turns my head towards a mirror on the other side of the dingy room.

I'm dead.

There's a hole in my head.  Blood wiped off my pale, blue face, but some of it still there.  I'm decrepid.  My head falls over as Gary positions me over his shoulder.

""Oh no, don't feel bad.  You look great!""  He lifts my head up again.  ""Why thank you.  I really do think we make a great pair.  Now let's get going.""

“It’s like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert, but I’m holding you closer than most.” – Ron Pope, *Drop in the Ocean*

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You waltzed right in, without knocking or announcing your entry, without waiting for permission, without a care at all.  I was eating a quick dinner and had changed just before you arrived, just in case you ended up being someone I wanted to impress. I had heard so much about you that I was fairly confident we would hit it off, and even though I assumed you were straight, I wanted to be friends with you before I even met you. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Rewind. I had been working at Chili’s that night. Abby told me earlier that she’d finally convinced you to come down with her for the party, so I was looking forward to going and meeting you.  When I got off work, I drove straight home, changed into a striped v-neck t-shirt that I bought a few weeks earlier in the little boys’ section at Marshall’s because I look good in it, and threw some breaded chicken into the microwave.  I texted Abby to let her know she could come pick me up, since she’d offered and this way I could drink and wouldn’t have to worry about driving. I was a little bit nervous about this, because I knew about the crush Abby had on me and I didn’t want to lead her on – I wasn’t interested in the least – but I felt pretty sure that she knew where I stood.  Turns out, I was wrong, but that’ll come into play later on.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, she arrives.  She pulls into my driveway, gives a little knock at the door, and I let her in.  She’s typical Abby – a little nervous, a little awkward, but nice and sweet and all the rest of those generic things that everyone says about everyone else.  Anyway, as I was collecting my alcohol to bring to the party (green apple Smirnoff) and trying to devour my dinner, Abby let slip that you were waiting in the car.  “Tell her to come in!” was obviously my reaction to that.  So, she did.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And that’s where this story began.  You danced in with your twinkling eyes, you’re indescribable smile, and the giggliest hello.  I melted.  Right there, that was when you had me.  You just came right in, like you owned the place, like we had been friends so long we were practically family… And then we were introduced.  Abby scolded you for just coming in without knocking or anything and I can’t remember if I said anything more than that it was totally okay, but I really liked that you did that.  I liked the way you commanded the room.  I liked how light your command was, too – how it felt more like a plea, or a wish from a fairy or a princess in one of those Disney movies we watched as kids – lovely and pure, as you are.  And I especially like that you seemed so comfortable – it made me feel comfortable (which isn’t something I’m used to in the presence of such a pretty girl).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Immediately I knew you were going to cause problems for me, because somehow you were already in my head.  I literally took a second to say to myself (silently, of course), “she’s straight, she’s Abby’s cousin, she’s not interested – don’t even try.”  “No, bad ~~dog~~ girl.”  I was doing well, too! I even caught myself a couple of times and pulled back.  I wanted to flirt so badly, but I kept it in.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Soon, I finished eating, grabbed my stuff, and we piled into Abby’s car to go back to her house where the party was already going on.  We didn’t say a whole lot to each other in the car, but you were happy and smiley and so pretty and way too cool for me, so naturally I was totally captivated.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When we arrived at the party, we went in and I was introduced to a few of Abby’s friends and some people who I guess were her roommates.  One girl who became my beer pong partner (secretly, as we were setting up for pong, I was hoping you’d ask to play so I could ask you to be my partner) introduced herself to me as Diamond Princess.  I started calling her DP for short and, as it turns out, those are her real actual initials.  That’s not important to the story; I just thought it was funny.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pong went on forever and we just wanted it to end, so the other team tricked DP into thinking we won just so we could stop playing.  The whole time you were playing with the music and talking to Abby and, most importantly, dancing.  When I watched you dance, the rest of the party was on pause.  Everything stopped – it was just you and the music.  You smiled and laughed and your eyes sparkled.  Abby was right when she said you were more yourself that night than she’d seen in a long time.  Obviously I couldn’t have known that then, because I had never met you before, and I probably can’t even know that now, because that’s the only night I met you, but I believe it because of how alive you seemed.  More full of life than anyone else at the party.  Hard to believe you tried to off yourself the very next day.  Forget social work; you should pursue a career in acting.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We finally finished pong and gave up the table for someone else to play, and I moved to stand closer to the stage so I could watch you dance more.  Abby found her way over and joked with me about how, regardless of whether you’re singing the right words or not, you love to sing along to every song.  I thought that was just the cutest thing.  That song Some Nights by FUN came on the iPod while we were down there – you continued dancing and we all sang along (or, you know, tried to).  I had forgotten about that until you brought it up via text a few days later, when you said “Every time Some Nights comes on I think about us hanging out in the basement.”  Now it’s a memory I hold onto, and when I hear Some Nights on the radio or on someone’s iPod, it makes me think of you and I feel closer to you for just those four minutes and thirty-seven seconds even though we can’t talk anymore.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anyway, after that song we kind of all made our way upstairs.  I really only went up there because you did, and I wanted to be wherever you were.  I hope I wasn’t too obvious.  The next thing I remember is when a bunch of us decided to play cards.  We didn’t know what to play, and we went back and forth for a while, but we ended up on Egyptian Rat Screw – you know, that game where you each put down a card on your turn and you slap the pile on doubles and sandwiches.  I wanted you to play so badly.  You were sitting on the couch not far from me, and I was sitting on the floor somewhat facing you, stealing glances as often as I could manage.  I didn’t win the game, and I couldn’t convince you to play with us, but it was fun anyway.  And I was content just knowing you were there.  Until you weren’t.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;About halfway through the game, you got up and went outside.  I wasn’t sure what you were doing, but Abby got all concerned when you were walking out.  She was practically mothering you the whole night.  I guess, considering the circumstances, it was totally understandable, but I remember thinking she should probably ease up on you a little bit.  I doubt that it would have changed anything, though.  Anyway, you said you were going outside to call your roommate.  Well, you said “to make a phone call” and Abby had to drag out of you who you were calling.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You didn’t tell me until a few days later, via text, that you were calling your roommate to convince you not to make moves with me, because both of you knew about the crush Abby had on me.  After you were outside talking on the phone, you only came back in for about a minute before you went to bed.  It was at that point that I was over the party and was ready to go home.  If you weren’t there, I didn’t really care to hang out any longer.  But I stuck it out for a few more minutes so it wouldn’t be too obvious, and because I didn’t want to hurt Abby’s feelings.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Side note: as I’m writing this outside the coffee shop Holy Grounds (Catholic University loves its bible puns) in the student center at school, I see your cousin walking in the doors.  I immediately feel a rush of emotions: nervous, awkward, hesitant, and then also all of the things that you make me feel.  What feelings do I have about you?  Well, whatever they are, they’re strong.  Stronger than they should be, I know.  The mix of feelings that make me so drawn to you with the ones that make me so avoidant of Abby at the same time is confusing to say the least.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So you go into Abby’s room to supposedly go to bed (whether or not that’s really what you did, I will never know) and I start thinking of an exit strategy.  It wasn’t hard to think of one.  “I think I’m about ready for bed, whenever you’re ready to get me out of here.”  That’s not an exact quote, but probably extremely close to whatever it is I did say.  Abby was ready then, and we got up and I said my goodbyes to everyone I met at the party, save you.  I told myself I was going to go knock on the door and give you a hug and say it was nice to finally meet you and then leave.  I was sure I was going to do it.  As I stood up, I even got butterflies because going in to say bye to you made me so nervous.  Actually, it was just interacting with you that made me nervous.  As you already know, I didn’t do that.  I didn’t work up the courage to go in and say goodnight to you.  And I’ve been kicking myself for not going in there ever since.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It’s probably for the best that we weren’t alone together at the end of the night, though.  Even for the 30 seconds it would have taken to say goodnight.  We were both so attracted to each other and you were my entire focus – I wouldn’t have even thought about it before saying something that crossed a line or even kissing you in my drunken stupor if I started to get a vibe from you.  But you were good; I didn’t get a vibe at all.  I had no idea you were interested in the least.  You hiding away probably had a lot to do with that.  That was the only chance I’ve had so far, and probably the only chance I am going to get, to kiss you.  Or hug you.  Or see your smile one last time.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would say that I strongly regret not going into that room to see you before I left that night, but honestly it’s a stupid thing to regret.  As much as I would have, and I hope you would have, enjoyed it, Abby would’ve found out what happened and you would’ve felt guilty.  You told me that if we had kissed then, you probably would’ve tried to kill yourself that night instead of the night after.  I don’t think I could have handled that.  So I’m glad it didn’t happen.  I’m still upset I missed out on a chance to kiss you, though.

1350359333.0,7,self.shortstories,11jwvk,Uhhmm...Well I'm 13 and I would like to be a writer when I get older so here's one of my short stories. Reviews? Be honest.,AdventureTeenager,9,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/11jwvk/uhhmmwell_im_13_and_i_would_like_to_be_a_writer/,"Damn. Now I really didn't see this happening. Of all the things to happen at this bland school and this is the shit that happens. Wow. I guess I'm getting a bit carried, let me start from the beginning. 
          My school, Jefferson Middle School, is rather boring, nothing really exciting happens here except the occasional girl drama that usally goes like, ""Brian likes me! Not you, skany hoe!"" And ends in a matter of three days. I'm usually quiet, if you were to call me ""popular girl,"" you would be wrong but calling me a ""nerd"" wouldn't be right either. I was just sort of there. I had my friends and that's all I needed. That's where this story starts. With my friend, Daniel. Daniel was a pretty intresting boy. All acceralted classes, loved video games and comics, and wasn't bad looking at all. Over the first year of middle school, Daniel and I became pretty close. Hanging out after school and learning about eachother. It was pretty nice. Daniel loved life and he wasn't afraid to show it. If he had something to say, oh would he say it, but he was never disrespectful about it. He was always being a gentlemen. People always said shit about him. 
         ""Oh! Did you hear about Daniel? I heard he was sucking cock in the bathroom!"" 
         ""Daniel the fag!""
         ""Daniel should go burn in fucking hell with all the other fags that enjoy buttsex!"" Get the trend here? They kept on saying he was gay, over and over. Through messages on Facebook, notes, or even writing on bathroom walls, which is very cliche. There have been times where I have asked if he was gay and I would get the same answer every time. 
          ""Do you think I am?"" Over and over, he never changed it. Daniel was really proud and he felt as if he shouldn't state if he were gay or not and I really admire that about him. 8th grade started and I assumed that the gay jokes would have gotten old by now, but they didn't. They actual got worse. More people started calling him a ""fag, dick-sucker,"" and spreading rumors that I don't even wanna remember. I noticed a change in Daniel, he wasn't as outgoing, didn't speak his mind, became less quite, less proud. I tried helping him, I really did but it never worked. He seemed to just become more depressed. Those kids never noticed either, they just attacked him more and more, getting more ruthless with each insult. This drama was lasting way more than three days and I wasn't sure what would happen. Shit even got worsed.
          That's when I heard the intercom come on one day during class.
       ""Students, I am sad to announce that our student, Daniel Rigsbee, has died yesterday."" They didn't tell us how he died, but we all knew. He killed himself. The voice of the principal announcing his death was so fucking emotionless, it made it seem as if Daniel was some character in a movie that died. Everyone was silent. I was filled with anger. Those ruthless bastards did this. They didn't know when to stop. The minute the bell rang, I sprinted to his house asking if it was true was they said today. His father simply nodded and beckoned me in. He said that there was a note left in his room directed to me and ""bitches."" I walked to his room, feeling as if I was going to puke. I found the note, all directed in rainbows, colors, and smiley faces. It made me sick. I opened the note with nervoness and read.
        ""Dear Juno and the son of bitches at school. Let me make this clear. I am not fucking gay. I am as straight as the pole your mom dances on. I should not have to tell people this, it's my life and you shouldn't be butting in. Pun intended. You caused this and I hope you feel great. You did it! You've killed me! I'm not gonna say that this wasn't your guys' fault because fuck that. It totally was. I hope you live with that burden that you killed me for your whole life. Juno, I hope you live a great life and don't cry over me, you didn't cause this. You are amazing and don't let people do what they did to me to you. I would punch their neck. (:
                                            Bye,
                                                  Daniel-Not fucking gay-Rigsbee
        What the fuck? That wasn't sad at all. This was the Daniel that I knew. He killed himself because he was done of the shit. I don't think he felt sorry or anything. I don't even know. As I turned to leave, I found something else. It was another note reading, ""I hope this was exciting enough for you, Juno. I am a coward. I wasn't gonna deal with this anymore. They didn't win, remerber that. I won. They get to deal with my death. -Daniel""

I had this dream.
It must’ve been the 1950’s, or some time earlier.
I wasn't sure how I got there, but I knew that I wasn’t in my body, and that I wasn’t driving my car.
We had the top down and were speeding down an old country two-lane road.
 
The prettiest girl in the world was sitting in my passenger seat.
She was sitting cross-legged, facing me, with the wind blowing her gorgeous golden-brown hair all over the place.
She was laughing. I could never forget that perfect smile.
The orange light from the setting sun caused a glisten in her eyes. I loved the way that I couldn’t keep my focus whenever I was around her.
 
What was peculiar about this was that I felt as if it happened all in one instant, but at the same time it felt like hours. I guess this is how love is supposed to feel.

She screamed with delight. She loved feeling free.
I didn’t know where I was driving, but she didn’t care.
It doesn’t matter where you are when you’re with the most beautiful girl on Earth.
 
I managed to break the allure of her hazel-green eyes to check the road.
Nothing.
Just the open road, a warm sunset, and the girl of my dreams sitting next to me.
 
Or so I thought.
 
I don’t know what happened but the car suddenly flipped over.
Everything was silent.
I can’t clearly recall what happened but I remembered that her once-gorgeous golden-brown hair was soiled with blood and that her hazel-green eyes were filled with tears at one point.
But, she never cried.
 
The worst part was that I couldn’t save her.
I reached for her but could never touch her. I called for her but she never answered.
The last thing I saw was that glisten fade from her eyes.
 
I don’t know if I ended up surviving, but it didn’t matter.
All I knew was that I had robbed the world of the prettiest girl that it had ever seen.
I could never forgive myself.

Certainly, there’s more legroom, but there’s also the sensation. Looking to the left, ideas begin to form.

The little voice says, “Do it. Do it and let yourself go.”

But he can’t.
	
Thinking about the plunge. The sensation of falling. Stomach dropping, G-forces rippling his face, tearing at his eyes, his clothes. Attempting to rip him apart before he inevitably strikes the ground at hundreds of miles per hour.
	
And after the impact, darkness. The end.
	
Yet that can’t happen.
	
As the stewardess hands him his peanuts, he returns his attention to page twenty-three of the financial report he owes his boss when he lands.
	
He pours himself a drink. A four and a half hour flight with two-hour delay, three hours to his office because of traffic, twenty minutes of listening to his boss yell at him because he’s such a failure and another hour home.
	
Drinking his scotch, his mind returns to the row. The sensation that almost overwhelmed him. That almost forced him to leap from thirty thousand feet. That almost ended him.
	
Here it was again.
	
Dragging himself to the balcony he looks over the edge. The people seem so small and insignificant from his vantage point, as if they were ants, following their daily routines. He gazes up at the iconic statue, stationed in the harbor, which once welcomed his great-grandparents to the home of the brave.
	
He climbs up onto the railing; still undecided.
	
A flag whips about in the gust of wind.
	
And a woman screams.

1343705310.0,5,self.shortstories,xfhk4,INSANITY,,10,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/xfhk4/insanity/,"You hear this one a lot: “The definition of insanity is to repeat the same thing over and over again and expect different results.”

That isn’t true.

No, that’s not insanity.

I had a friend once. We’ll call him Jason. Sure, Jason. One thing you need to know about Jason is that he was a chronic nail-biter. He was the type of kid who you rarely saw without his hand up to his mouth, chewing. Just gnawing on the tough protein covering his fingers. I remember when we were very young his mother would paint his nails with clear Thum nailbiting polish that would leave a peppery and bitter taste in his mouth. But Jason didn’t care. He’d grit and bite the polish right off. He just did not care. His poor mother put that polish on his nails every single day, but he outlasted her. She eventually stopped once she realized Jason was starting to actually like the taste.

They were perpetually moist, his fingers. Jason near constantly bit his nails. He bit them right down to the epidermis and until his teeth couldn’t get a grip on the nail itself, or until it bled. It wasn’t a nervous thing, it was just a Jason thing. When you first got to know Jason you’d politely ignore it but eventually you’d get annoyed and disgusted. Then you learned to ignore it.

Jason wasn’t your average nail-biter, though. This kid never, not even once, spit out a chewed up keratin remnant on the ground. He told me the habit was disgusting enough, and he didn’t need to ramp it up by spitting nail all over the carpet. So he pocketed them. Each one. He’d chew and gnaw and bite and peel and once he had shaved off just enough of the nail to tear it off, he’d put it in his pocket.

Aside from this admittedly common habit, Jason was by and large average. We played sports together, soccer league. My mom would babysit him after school sometimes. He liked his sandwiches cut diagonally. One time I went over Jason’s house to spend the night.

Your nails grow at an average of 3 millimeters a month. They’re a form of hair, not many people know that. That’s why when you file your nails, that unmistakable smell pierces your nose, crinkling the minuscule hairs deep inside your nasal cavity. The speed in which they grow all depends on the length of the terminal phalange, so your index finger grows the quickest. In the summer, your nails grow faster. It’s true.

Every young kid has been in a situation where their friend falls asleep first at a sleepover and they don’t know what to do with themselves. On foreign territory, you’re on your own to either entertain yourself quietly or force yourself to fall asleep. On this night at Jason’s house, that kid was me. Jason was sound asleep on his bed and I was on the floor next to him in a sleeping bag, wide awake.

Bored out of my mind and doing anything to keep myself occupied before I got sleepy, I start feeling around the darkness of underneath his bed. It was very dark and I could only make out darker blobs of some number of objects tucked away under the safety of his mattress. To get a better reach, I turn myself on my stomach and turn my head flush against the carpet, unable to see what I was grabbing at now.

Jason wasn’t your average nail-biter. I reached my arm further under the bed and wrapped my fingers around what was surely some sort of glass jar. Still on my stomach with my head turned to the side, I slowly moved my hand up the jar’s opening. A mass of something cold and wet my fingers feel. Like tiny, wet wood chips. Like chewed up sunflower seeds. Like chewed up nails.

I jerk my hand back, moving my head back in position to see under his bed. Still, the darkness shrouds the jar I was feeling at. I get on my chest again and use my middle finger to delicately roll the jar out from under the bed and into plain sight. As I rolled it closer, the contents of the jar were clear.

An entire jelly jar’s worth of chewed up and spit out, *and pocketed*, nail fragments lined the inside of the glass. Half moon crescents of nail stuck to the inside walls of the jar, stained purple from scraped out Smucker’s grape jelly. Without a lid, a mass of chewed nail clippings was near dribbling out the exit of the jar, moist with saliva. Pocket lint was scattered throughout the mess. The smell is a thing difficult to describe but for fans of black licorice I’ll spare you the thought.

I look under the bed once more, seeing three, four, maybe even five more dark cylinders. More jars. More jars full of nails. I reach under again and touch glass. This jar wasn’t as full as the last. A new collection.

Gagging on the smell and desperate to hide my intrusion I roll both jars back to their original resting place. A wet glob of nails knocked loose by my jostling of the jars just lay on the carpet, moistening the plastic fibers. The lump of finger protein almost seemed to be taking the form of the original contents of the glass jar. I dig the side of my palm into the carpet and grit my teeth, scraping part of Jason’s nail collection back under the bed.

The side of my palm now wet from the spit that covered the nail shavings, I wipe it on a dry section of carpet. Making every effort going to sleep, I feel like I’m laying on a bed of nails. No pun intended.

You do any one thing enough times, over and over again, it begins to become ritual. More than ritual, even. It starts to become who you are. Doesn’t matter what it is. Washing your hands obsessively. Making sure every straight edge is aligned perfectly. Cracking your knuckles repeatedly. Biting your nails. Storing them in jars. Over and over. Over and over. Never expecting a different result—but enjoying the power of knowing it.

That’s insane.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_xfhk4,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/xfhk4/insanity/,

The teenage boy stood over the body of his best friend, his confident, and the only person who stayed as a constant in his life. For a moment, the boy could do nothing but stare at the gaping wound in her chest and attempt to convince himself she was still alive- that in a moment she would jump up and laugh at him for getting emotional over her little prank. But finally, he could deny it no longer. 
It was in that moment of acceptance that his legs lost their strength and he fell to the floor beside her. As badly as he wanted to cry, he was unable to overcome the state of shock that came with the girl's death. It took several minutes for him to regain control over his body and when he did, he placed a hand over her injury. With his other hand he brushed the hair away from her face and smoothed the hair on her head. With a shaking voice the boy began to speak. 
He spoke to the girl as if she was still alive, recounting the countless memories he had of her. He started from the day they first met and continued to tell stories of the 8 years they spent together as best friends. Finally, when he reached the current day, his voice cracked and tears began to fill his eyes. ""I've had this  day planned out for weeks now. Did you know that? This definitely wasn't supposed to happen. I was going to pick you up from your house like I do every Saturday morning and tell you I had a surprise for you. You were going to be excited because you loved nothing more than unexpected surprises. I was going to take you to the lake where you taught me to swim and when you asked why we were there I was going to grab your hand and give you speech I've been rehearsing for a year now. I was going to tell you how you're the most important person in my life and I was tired of pretending you were only my best friend. I was going to tell you that I couldn't stand seeing guys flirt with you and I hated pretending I was happy for you whenever you started liking a guy. I was going to tell you how I almost killed Eric when he made you cry that one day. I was going to tell you that I love you. That I want you and no one else. And even if you didn't feel that way about me I would always love you and I would never lose you as my best friend."" 
He did nothing to stop the tears as they began to freely fall down his cheeks and onto the body of the girl he loved. ""I guess I screwed that one up didn't I? Everything would have gone perfectly as planned, maybe we would even be kissing right now as a happy new couple. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have gotten mad at you. I couldn't control my jealousy. It wasn't even your fault. You just made an innocent comment about that boy you kissed last year and I blew up on you. I didn't stop yelling until you couldn't take it and you ran away from me. I was so mad I didn't even try and stop you. We were so close to the lake too. It took me so long to realize I was being irrational and stupid. Too long.

He had a shirt as blue as the sky and was smoking a pipe made of a corn cob. His eyes looked as gray and fogged over as the sky in the smog-filled city of Los Angeles.

The bench groaned under his weight, it was obviously very old. Suddenly, without warning, the bench collapsed under him and high-pitched laughter, like the cackle of a hyena erupted from beside him.

You continue reaching, until, at last, you finger brushes its wing. At once, it hops backwards, soaring straight for the window, but you get there first and slam it shut. The bird flies straight into it, chirping angrily; showing true terror in every action.
You turn to me. ""This is what they do to us"" You say, expression blank, angry. ""That's not beautiful, that's cruelty.""
And, despite the hurt done, I learnt more in that conversation than in all my years of schooling.

Sickly green curtains hung limp over the window, adorned with lilacs and daisies. The room was strangely devoid of personality. There were no clothes to be seen, everything was neat and orderly, and there was no dog-eared journal, yellow and faded with age.  
  ""Where is my notebook?"" he thought, angrily. He propped himself up in the bed and searched closer.  
  Nothing.  
  He did, however, notice the framed portrait of an old couple on the bedstand.  
  ""Oh.""  
  He realized where he was, and shakily stood up to get a coffee.  
  As he hobbled down the halls of the nursing home, he looked around at the others in the entertainment rooms. They sat about, some talking, others watching TV, others still merely sitting and watching their lives fade away. The only thing they had in common were their eyes. Each one shared the same look, the same gaze, one of hopelessness and disgust and confusion.  
  ""Good morning Edward!"" someone called out.  
  He paused, unsure how to react, or to whom. ""Good morning to you too!"" he eventually responded, to no one in particular.  
  His name was Francis. 

  When Francis finally reached the kitchen, he paused again.  
  Why had he come here?  
  He began to rummage through the various drawers and cabinets.  
  ""What are you looking for, Francis?""  
  The voice frightened him. He looked around, starled. One of the nurses stood in the kitchen, watching him quietly.  
  ""Oh, just whatever I find."" he said, suddenly cheery.  
  She smiled a sad sort of smile and left him to his own devices.  
  The coffee machine gurgled on the counter. ""Ah, that's right. Coffee."" Francis thought. He pulled a stained blue glass out of the cupboard, and set it brusquely on the table. He shakily grabbed the pot and poured the coffee into the glass, spilling enough to dribble down the sides and onto the wood below. He set the pot back on the machine, and picked up the steaming glass.  
  He cried out in pain as the hot glass burned his hand, and he dropped the glass onto the floor.  
  ""I'll get that"" said the nurse as she swept up the glass and called for a mop.  
  Francis stood, rooted to the ground, looking very scared, and confused. He didn't understand.  
  The nurse returned with an insulated styrofoam cup, and filled it with coffee for him.  
  ""Oh, thank you Agnes."" said Francis, with a warm and overlarge smile, as he shuffled out of the room clutching the cup.  
  Her name was Alice. &amp;#32;

  Francis sat on the cold, hard couch and stared at the cup of coffee. A television played Fox News very loudly in the background, and, at another table, a man sat playing chess with himself.  
  ""Francis, your grandson is here to see you!""  
  He looked up, to see a different nurse guiding a man to the couch where he sat. Francis smiled.  
  ""Hello Robert!"" He said cheerily.  
  ""Hi Grandpa"" answered Robert, somewhat meekly.  
  ""Would you like a coffee?"" Francis asked. ""The nurse poured me one, but I didn't really want it.""  
  ""Sure, Grandpa."" Robert said, as he grimaced and took a sip. ""Thank you.""  
  Francis was very pleased. He smiled at Robert for a moment, then asked eagerly ""So how is school going? You must be in the 11th grade by now, isn't that right?""  
  Robert paused, unsure how to answer. ""I'm in the 14th grade, Grandpa.""  
  ""Oh."" Francis said. ""Well, I always liked the 11th grade. That was the year I met your mother!""  
  Robert looked rather uncomfortable. ""You mean Grandma?"" 
  ""Ah yes."" Said Francis, ignoring him. ""Say, be sure to let your mother and I know if you ever need help paying for college.""  
  There was a long pause, and Robert teared up. ""Grandpa, Grandma has been dead for 9 months.""  
  ""No, she hasn't!"" Francis said, airily. ""She's right here with us! Agnes! Come over here Agnes, Robert has come to visit.""
  The background chatter hushed, and head began to swivel towards the pair.  
  ""Agnes? Come on honey, don't you want to visit?"" A note of concern began to enter his voice. Robert was crying.
  ""Where have you gone? Get over here you old bat!"" Francis stood up, and began to search for his dead wife. He stumbled down the hall, screaming her name, confused and angry, at this, at himself, at everything. 
  Robert still sat on the couch, holding the cold cup of coffee, tears running down his face. Next to him, the spot where his grandfather had once sat was still warm.  
  He was once a brilliant man, an engineer. He lived his live with vigorous pride and determination. He worked hard, retired early, and gained the respect of almost everyone he met. He was happy, and others were happy for him. His life was charmed, it seemed. 
  But now, he hobbled through the halls of the nursing home, yelling at the empty frames on the wall and the empty people that lived there. He screamed and searched for his wife who would never be found. He could no longer understand.  
  His name was Francis.

Valedictorian, Rhodes Scholar, possessing prefect penmanship: everything about Peerless was without flaw, including her exactingly cerulean blue eyes that never saw a moment of bloodshot.

Her honey-blonde coif was always neat, with never a hair out of place; and today it was held nicely in French braids, without a fray in view. The stylish shoes she wore were never scuffed; and the seams of her white stockings were always straight as an arrow from her heel up to beneath the neatly pressed skirt that covered areas polite ladies simply do not discuss.

In her, perfection was personified; but the problem of perfection is boredom. For Peerless, nothing ever went awry; nothing unfolded in any way that wasn't exactly as it should. Though perfect to external eyes, she dreamed of new discoveries that didn't exist in her world--a world which made her weary. Even now, while sitting on a park bench, contemplating her end, she showed impeccable posture. Try as she might, she simply could not slouch. This was typical Peerless. Even the gun she brought with her was polished to an unearthly sheen. She had only one bullet--after all, she wouldn't need more.

Aiming at her chest and pulling the trigger with her thumb she fired, and felt no pain. As she calmly set the gun beside her, she felt the eyes of many upon her, but she was used to that, sadly. Looking down, the perfect rosette of blood formed on her white blouse, and not a single petal of the red unfolded in a manner unbecoming her legacy of exactitude. She had hoped for irreverent chaos, splatters, or gore. Instead she was a picture-perfect soon-to-be corpse as the blood billowed outward in circles; yet not a drop fell on her skirt.

""Dammit,"" she said, ""I can't even screw this up.""

Then she closed her eyes as if going to sleep and breathed her last. Peerless left nothing out of place for the police and paramedics as they rushed in moments too late. In the end she got what she long desired, just not for herself: a chorus of glorious noise surrounded her body as she quickly grew cold.

Someplace, wherever it is that spirits go, Peerless found some satisfaction in the mess she finally was able to make.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_knuk7,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/knuk7/short_story_peerless/,
1310284056.0,7,self.shortstories,ilh8k,I've been writing a lot of poetry for a while but then I started reading Richard Brautigan and his stuff made me want to try short stories.  Here is my attempt at something weird and relatively short.,gadimus,7,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ilh8k/ive_been_writing_a_lot_of_poetry_for_a_while_but/,"I'm an odd memory in most minds.  Like a harrowing communal conscience of migratory birds or a sea breeze that took a train to the prairies and is seen walking along the street.  I suppose I'm a sort of stationary, a figment used to paint a portrait of understanding but this is really strange since I am not at all like a brush or ladle or roller or whatever would make sense to paint something.  I've been a transient congested throat in days gone by.  I swam from seashores to deep blue waters and sailed away.  All in all I think I've had things pretty good up until now.  But right now I feel like a bag of squeezed lemons left to rot, like I've gone through a garlic press alongside the garlic, I feel like I can't even like this situation and I really wanted to like it.


Let me clarify.


I believe in god about as much as I believe in myself.  If you get to know me you'll find I don't believe in myself that much.  But if you get to know me better you'd know that I've met him.  I'm not saying him in that god is male it's just that calling him *it* seems strange and it's a default.  With that in mind it was a day just like today with me on a stage but I was in the middle of a wheat field and opera singers dressed as vikings were scattered around looking for cues, lines and presumably marbles in the dirt.  It hit me that I shouldn't be there, I was supposed to be somewhere else but I felt if I left now to I would likely be eaten or worse, stood on, read then knocked around by the vikings.


It was at this point that god pulled up in a brand new jeep made out of a thunderstorm and waved his arms in a motion that very distinctly triggered a perhaps unbelievable but entirely real sense that he was god and I should get on his thunderstorm-jeep-of-love to ride away to eternal safety and abundance.  So I hopped up onto the cloud and into the passenger seat.  He looked at me in a way only god could with eyes as deep as artesian wells, with a sort of sisyphean tenure gained only after watching over everything for ten times eternity and then started speaking with a very plain voice.


""Would you like to take the wheel?"" he asked and I didn't really want to but this was sort of troubling because.... why would anyone turn down an offer from god and he said ""It's alright, with the exception of your neighbor nobody has actually wanted to drive the thunderstorm the first time meeting me.  In general it is an odd question to ask, isn't it?""


I smiled politely.


Then he said ""Alright here's the deal.  You get three questions answered.  Anything in the realm of conceivable knowledge of the infinity that is me.  Three of them.  Just ask whenever and I'll answer but when I answer the last one you will die.""


""What!? Why?"" I blurted out of shock as he looked at me.  I looked right back at those constellations within constellations within a walmart parking lot folded over into itself and back out towards the sunrise.


I smiled realizing the game was ruined and asked ""Are you serious?""


Then he laughed, we drove a short while in silence and he dropped me off a block away from home still a little agitated by his interactions with my neighbor the week before.


""You can't screw this up by just asking silly off the top of your mind questions.  Here is my email address.  Send your questions there and I'll have an answer for you written out within a day or two."" god said as plainly as before from inside his thunderstorm with the window rolled down while gesturing blindly in the air to make a point or sign what he was saying but it was entirely lost on me.  He could tell by my glazed look it was time to go so he simply said ""Get a job"" and drove off.


So now.  Slightly but not entirely glazed in circumstance I am struggling with this interaction.  I can know anything in the universe via email at the cost of my life.  I don't really have a desire to acquire knowledge or a need for something like this... so here I am a bag of lemons staring off at the sky like it is staring back in part of that endless crashing gaze of god wondering what the hell I should do with myself.

Maybe that’s why I’m writing this now, today. Not that I’ve never thought about this before. It’s just that nothing happened today. I woke up. I sat on the couch for an hour. I checked my mailbox around noon: nothing. I watched the clouds roll by to the droning of the television. I’m not even sure what it was that was on. Some game show or other shit program that advertises false happiness for free. I’m so fed up with wealth being the only source of happiness that’s feasible anymore. But everyone thinks that, don’t they? I can’t even be original with my angst. Not that I was original in anything I’ve done thus far with my life. 


See, my mother died when I was nine. I’ve already said that, but the point is I never quite came to terms with it. I woke up in September, and she was dead. Car accident. Not that the cause is really important. The end result is always the same. And like I said, I never really dealt with this. I was nine. What nine year old can comprehend death? What third grader can grasp the idea that their mother stopped living?  She’s gone, they told me. She’s in heaven. I remember looking up the directions to heaven that night. Why did she go, and not bring me? When is she coming home? Mommy is never coming home, they said. Well, never is a long time. Never hasn’t come and gone yet, not for me. And see, I struggled with this concept for a long time. And as a nine year old trying to come to grips with his and everyone else’s mortality, I wasn’t very fun to be around.  I grew up with no real friends, just people I talked to on occasion. That kid in the back of the class that everyone whispered about and avoided in the halls? That was me. 


My father tried to help, at least. He tried to get me interested in sports. He’d take me outside to throw a football. I pretended to be interested. I tried really hard to be enthusiastic about something, anything. But really, what was the point? We all live; we all die. It’s a useless cycle of oxygen exchanged with carbon dioxide. Eventually we all become food for trees. Apathy had a stranglehold, and it wasn’t letting go. I tried therapy. They told me I was depressed, so I tried antidepressants. They just made me anxious. I tried writing, but I was never any good. Everything came out stiff. I tried learning an instrument but my fingers never moved the way I wanted them to. Eventually even my father gave up on me. So forgive me if I don’t believe you when you say you care. When your father gives up you, you’re at the bottom. That’s really just it. And what’s sad, what is so fucking pathetic, is that none of this is unique. Do you know how many assholes have lived this same life? This apathy isn’t original, it’s cliché. I’m just a sad speck in the spectrum of grey nothingness that is the universe. 


And today, nothing happened. I woke up; I lived; I sighed; I gave up. My dog hasn’t even looked at me today. Aren’t dogs supposed to sense emotions and respond appropriately? Maybe it’s because I’m not sad. I’m not angry. I’m not anything. I just am. I exist. Who cares? Not my dog, not my father; not my mother, that’s for damn sure. So the sun set today, like it has every day in history, and I sat down at my desk. This time I’m not writing for catharsis. I’m not writing to get better. I’m writing so you understand why. And tomorrow the sun is going to rise. Just like today, the day that nothing happened. Just like that day in September when I was nine and my mother was dead. And tomorrow, something might happen, just not for me.

Agent Martin makes his way back to work after lunch break. His office, on the top floor of the Data Security Center—DSC—is indistinguishable in design and contents from the other offices on the vast floor. All are small soundproof rooms, windowless, shut off by black sliding glass doors. Each office is a command center. 

Martin takes his seat, yawns, and puts on his headset. He enjoys his job; it often reminds him of playing video games as a youth. He turns to the monitor on his right, strikes a few keys on the keyboard, and up pops a panel showing birds-eye footage of a suburban neighbourhood. A large textbox underneath reads “Approaching Destination: 200 meters”. The number steadily decreasing. This damn wind hasn't let up the slightest, he thinks, shaking his head. It had been extremely windy the entire day. Prior to leaving for lunch, he had delployed a set of four drones—as was the standard deployment—packed in a larger camoflauged container-unit—camo-con—which was the source of the footage now on screen. 

The targets name was Wesley Smith. His activities had been flagged with  “Acute Suspicion”  by the system earlier that morning. All such cases required the attention of and if necessary, investigation—or “analysis” as it called—by an agent. Martin considered it bad luck when such cases were assigned to him. He had groaned when the notification had popped up. The day was fairly quiet and he'd been having great fun micro-managing a drone in a local park. The notification had presented him with a typically boring task. Wesley was sixteen years old. Another stupid sixteen year old that's fascinated with how drugs or bombs can be made, he'd thought then. However, to his delight, he found that the flag had nothing to do with the users querying history, but rather it's lacktherof. Wesley, it seemed, had found himself some very good encryption software—that the system must be unfamiliar with—as over the past nine hours, his data footprint had been reduced tremendously, triggering the flag. Martin had let out a whistle as he thought about all the different possibilites. There was a small chance that this kid possesed data that could lead to him to the source. These were the types of cases Martin was best at. He would surely get a promotion if he were to uncover the creators behind some black market encryption package. He had then followed the standard procedure, flagged the case as “Under Analysis” and had deployed the drone set. The wind however, had delayed what should have been a half-hour trip to over an hour. 

Now, he watches as the container unit stops at ten meteres from what he assumes is the target's home. Gusts of wind gently rock the camera side to side. The house is an average looking two-storey house, an exception being the large apple tree in the front yard. Hanging from the tree, a tire-swing slowly sways back and forth. It's the swing that flashes in Martin mind; as a kid, he had a friend who lived in a home on that very street. Passing by here, he would often see children pushing each other on that swing. His mind wanders, and he finds himself wondering whether Wesley—No, he must'nt get distracted. The system begins running a series of tests to confirm that this is the correct house, then ejects the four drones from the container, and prompts Martin to guide the entry. 

This was probably the most enjoyable part of his job. He begins micromanaging the blade—the smallest, quickest and most agile of the set—and defines a distance for the others to trail behind. The blade was one inch long, half an inch wide, and four millimeters in height. It was a dull shade of grey and perfectly smooth. A barebone unit, it contained just a nano mic-cam component, a communications component, a power supply, and over a dozen micro-motors; it was fairly stealthy, ideal for recon. It's light weight also meant however, that it was a challenge to control in the wind, and Martin througly enjoyed this challenge. 

After zipping around some for fun, he spots an open window at the back side of the house. He thought it a bit odd for a window to be left open when it was this windy, but was able to determine that the room is unoccupied. As the small drone caravan silently advances into the dark room, the monitor to Martins left begins blinking. The hound—a relatively clumsly unit that Martin almost hadn't included—had detected illicit substances in it's proximity. A line of bolded text on the monitor reads: SUBSTANCE: [SCHEDULE I - CANNABIS], the last word—CANNABIS—appearing in green font. The change in font color was Martin's little hack to his own station, thus no one else would ever see it. He chucked to himself whenver it came up.

He suddenly dreads including the Hound in the set, and hopes it's a false positive. Standard procedure had to be followed now.  He issues the command for the drones to begin inspecting the room. Martin ran his own alrorithm—a feat that as far as he knows, only he has acomplished—for room inspection and was proud of it. The largest unit—the Tech—contains the processor shared by the four and is responsible for giving instructions to the other three. In fact, even now, the signals sent to the Blade by Martin are first processed by the Tech, and then only passed on if it considers them safe. It is a highly complex unit whose nano-mechanics Martin had always been in awe of, but was not authorized to program. Just to override it's room-inspection algorithm had taken him weeks and numerous demonstrations. But he had done it, and now the three drones would sniff, photograph, and record the sound in every visible and acessible space in the room, in at most three minutes. As the blade, he slides underneath the centimeter tall gap underneath the door, sees that it leads to an empty hallway, and remains there as a lookout. 

When the inspection completes, Martin sits silenlty looking over the new data while carefully listening for any sound through the headphones. The Bat, a unit with ultrasonic capability, working with the Hound had determined that a desk—the laptop sitting on which Martin disappointedly noted was powered off—contains in it's drawer, between three to four grams of marijuana. 

For the second time that day, Martin groaned. There was nothing more he could do here. Had he not discovered the weed, he could have gone probing further to try and hack a device on the network. But the presence of the drug had already been logged by the system. The case was no longer in his domain. Any further risk taken by him would be overridden or worse, logged and reported, by the Tech. He would not be doing any hacking today. 

As he begins to type out the mandatory report to send back to PRISM, he wonders who the case will be assigned to now—if it hadn't already—and what type of power and authorization that person has. Maybe, he thinks, it's someone inside this building somewhere. 

Regardless of what the system would do with the information he had just added to it, he was fully certain that young Wesley's days of being a free man were numbered.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1hf8kv,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hf8kv/2052/,

All around the Good Soldier were ruins. Not sun-bleached, weather-worn ruins like the ones he had seen in Greece.  The Greek ruins had reminded him of the time-polished bones of dead cattle on the ranch back home; white, perfect bones jutting up from the earth and basking in the hot sun.
  
The ruins he now walked among were not like that. These burned-out, pockmarked, structures were newly dead carcasses. The organs and hide were still intact, rotting on the bones. Smoke drifted from some of the buildings. The streets were empty.

The Good Soldier looked as shoddy as the destroyed buildings around him. His uniform was a disgrace, filthy and torn.  At some point, the left lapel of his jacket had been ripped away. He realized that somehow he had lost his dog-tags.  He had no name now, he couldn’t remember if he had ever had a name.

He had lost his helmet. It made him feel naked, worse than naked. He felt stripped and hung out on display like a newly butchered cow. His close-cropped dark hair was blanched with dust and sand.  His face was encrusted with a powder that had turned to clay after mixing with his sweat.  His blue eyes peered out through a colorless mask. 
The Good Soldier kept going, because that’s what good soldiers do. He had his gun, but his amo was spent.  He still carried the gun, for appearances.  He had a long knife on his belt, which was his only real weapon. He met no one as he crept down the street among the ruined buildings.

His throat was dry.  For what may have been the thousandth time that day, he glanced down at his watch.  The hour didn’t matter anymore but he glanced at his watch out of habit.  He looked up at the sky. The time his watch gave didn’t seem to match the sky.  Could it really be mid-day?  The sky wasn’t bright; it was a sickly, yellowish-brown.  Probably it was approaching evening.  The air wasn’t quite as hot. The Good Soldier wiped his forehead.  This too, was habit, since he wasn’t sweating.

He was thirsty but there was no sign of water anywhere. He didn’t see a market among the buildings that lined the street.  There was no public fountain, and not even a dirty canal. He wasn’t desperately thirsty, yet. He walked on.  An explosion had blanketed the street with a tawny layer of dust.  The Good Soldier’s boots made the first marks in the flawless surface.  Further on, he noticed the footprints of dogs, but there were no human or vehicle tracks.

He kept going and walked so far that he realized suddenly that he had reached the outskirts of the ruined town. He walked further onto an open road. He stopped and looked back, little wisps of smoke rose from the battered structures which now crouched in the distance, yellowish plaster and concrete against yellowish sky.  It was certainly evening now, he thought.

The road he walked on was gravel and extremely straight and flat.  It led out from the town and onward until it reached the horizon.  There were fields on either side of the road but they were brown and desolate. They weren’t green like fields in East Texas, he thought. 
He followed the road. He was completely vulnerable now, out in open terrain with a gun he couldn’t fire. The sun fell hot on the back of his neck. There was no reason to keep walking.  There was also no reason to turn back since he felt no fear.  He had never considered himself brave and his lack of fear wasn’t courage. He followed the road a long distance and the scenery didn’t change: dry, flat fields, a few distant structures where gunmen might hide.  The town fell further away behind him.  Though he didn’t know why, he had decided to follow the road all the way to the horizon.

Then he spotted a dun-colored cloud in the distance ahead of him.  It was either a dust-devil or a vehicle traveling along the road. He watched with a detached expression as the dust-cloud grew closer.  It seemed to take quite a long time to make its way.  The topography was very flat and the horizon was very far away.  Finally he could make out the truck, it was a MRAP, an armored fighting vehicle.  A huge cloud of dust followed behind.  The roaring of the engine and the noise of the tires grew louder. The Good Soldier stepped to the side of the road and waved his arm as the vehicle approached.  It came to a halt thirty feet away from him.  The dust-cloud that trailed the MRAP overtook it when it stopped and engulfed the MRAP and the Good Soldier. He coughed.  The dust began to clear. He walked toward the MRAP.  The door opposite him, the passenger side door, opened. An arm slung over the open door and a helmeted head popped up.  A man stared at the Good Soldier out of dark eyes.

“What are you doing?” the man said.

“Walking. I’m lost”

“You can ride with us if you know the password” the other man said. His face was young and still childishly round but his mouth and eyes were tightened in a harsh expression.

The Good Soldier thought for a moment. He couldn’t remember any passwords. He tried to think back to recent training.  He couldn’t remember anything about passwords. He felt baffled and very lost.

“I don’t know any password, sir”

The other soldier stared for a couple of seconds through the waning cloud of dust, now the air was almost clear again. The Good Soldier stared back with a blank expression.  The dust made little dunes above his eyelashes and had formed crusts at the corners of his blue eyes. Then the man’s head disappeared from above the door and the door banged shut.  A moment later the MRAP was rolling forward again.   The Good Soldier watched as it began to move, then he turned away to avoid the wake of dust.  A new coating of powder was added to the back of his uniform as he heard the noise of the engine and the grind of the tires fading gradually into the distance behind him. He continued walking in the opposite direction.  Soon, the road was quiet again. 
The Good Soldier continued forward along the road. He got thirstier as he went and his boots got heavier.  He saw some dry ditches long the roadside but no water.  Time passed but the undefined sun didn’t seem to change its position in the sky. The heat felt the same on the back of his neck.

The Good Soldier tried to unknow things as he walked. He had learned too much.  ""Thinking themselves wise they have become fools"" was his mother's favorite Bible verse. The Good Soldier had become the biggest fool he could imagine.  He thought about praying, more out of habit than anything. He could pray for water like Elijah, or for another MRAP to come along, he could pray for his buddies in combat or his friends at home, for himself, for his parents, for world peace. He smiled to himself and the clay mask around his lips was full of cracks. He had prayed too much before, there were no prayers left in him. Praying brought no comfort, only a sickening sensation. He knew how pathetic he was when he prayed.  He was selfish and only thought about himself.  He glanced at his watch.  The numbers had disappeared. The watch was dead. He shook his arm and tapped on the smooth, glass face of the watch.

He kept walking. He remembered how it was back at base. He imagined himself in his bunk. There was a box fan that one of the guys turned on at night.  The sound was mesmerizing.  He loved the vacant, white noise of the humming fan.  It was so soft and comforting.  He missed the fan.  Then he felt a bit nauseous that he had found comfort in the thought of a humming fan.

The Good Soldier perceived something ahead of him on the road. It was a figure.  The outlines were blurred by heat waves, he hadn’t realized how hot it still was. He kept walking.  As they approached each other, the figure became more defined.  It was a man in a dark robe. The man had a gray beard. Some sort of cleric, the Good Soldier thought.  He kept walking and he didn’t feel nervous.  As the figure approached, the Good Soldier waved to him.  The man waved back and then they were close to each other and their eyes met.   The robed man’s eyes were dark but his complexion was fair. His robe was black and he wore a hood over his gray hair. His long beard now seemed less like a cleric and more like a wizard.  The Good Soldier had read a lot of Harry Potter when he was a kid.

“Hello” the wizard said in a plain American accent.

“Hello. Who are you, sir?”  The Good Soldier asked.

“Who are you?” the wizard retorted.

“I don’t know, sir” the Good Soldier glanced down at the torn and stained lapel of his jacket.  There was no name there. He reached into the collar of his shirt and remembered he had lost his dog tags. “I guess I’m nobody” he said.

“It would be far more fortunate if you believed that” the wizard said. His voice was matter of fact. “You’re not lucky enough to be nobody”

“Who are you?” the Good Soldier asked. “Why are you out here by yourself?”

The wizard didn’t answer. “We will walk together” he said and gestured with a long arm for the Good Soldier to proceed forward.  “Talking is best while walking”

The Good soldier didn’t question his new companion any further; he felt somehow that questions were pointless now. They walked along in silence for a good space.  The road was deserted and the horizon hadn’t moved, the topography was very flat.  The sun was hot on the back of the Good Soldier’s neck.

“Why are your eyes full of despair?” The wizard asked. The Good Soldier glanced over and saw that the man was peering at him closely out of his large, wrinkle-enwrapped eyes.

There was a long pause, with just the sound of their footsteps crunching on the gravel.  The Good Soldier’s eyes were directed at the ground before his olive-green boots. He looked over and saw that his companion wore sandals and the hem of his black robe was tattered and dirty from the road.

“Some things happened back there” the Good Soldier said at last, taking his hand off his gun to gesture toward the town, now far off in the distance behind them.

“No justice for your friends, no justice for you” The wizard said simply as if reading the Good Soldier’s thoughts.

“Where do I put all this injustice?” the Good Soldier was surprised to hear his own voice rise, almost crack, there was a sudden knot in his throat.

“You have swallowed the injustice. You will carry it around inside your body forever” The wizard said.

There was a long pause.

“I got an email” The Good Soldier said abruptly, and then he trailed off. The clay around his mouth cracked into a frown.  “The only person I ever loved doesn’t love me anymore”

He was looking past the wizard at a place where the sky met the flat earth.  The sky was yellowish-brown, the earth was yellowish-brown. They blended together.

The wizard still peered at him intently, not watching the road in front of him as they walked. 

“Biology” the wizard said. ""Only matter, matters""

“Yeah, Biology” the Good Soldier said, looking at the wizard. His eyes returned to the road. He wasn’t sure what the wizard meant but he presumed a meaning of his own.

“What will you do without this person?” The wizard asked.

“Suffer”

“What did you do when you had her?”

“I suffered. But it was different; it was suffering with a purpose and a hope at the end and little gaps in the suffering that were full of beauty”

“Now it’s just suffering” the wizard said, shaking his head. “What will become of you?”

“I don’t know. I guess there’s nothing I can do”

“I'm afraid, the more you look at it, the more you will see that you are right”

“Life is meaningless” the Good Soldier said, that was why he had been so fearless the last few weeks, it wasn’t courage.

“If only that were so!” The wizard said, his voice sharp. He raised his hands toward the sky as if supplicating. The sleeves of his dark robe rustled with the movement of his forward steps. “Fools comfort themselves in that.  Or worse they say 'only what doesn't matter, matters'. Unfortunately, life is utterly meaningful. That is why the injustice aches and festers in your belly.  Some are lucky because they believe life is meaningless, but you know better. The truth has imprisoned you just as truth always imprisons those who find it”

The Good Soldier’s blue eyes lingered on the man’s face. It wasn’t a kind face, it was cruel, but not hateful. He didn’t much like the man.

“At least life is short”

“Don’t speak nonsense. You know very well that life is long”

“I don’t see how you mean. I’ve seen lives end, they were too short”

“What happens when you die, answer honestly as a man. Don’t give me bookish answers from your childhood”

The Good Soldier thought for a while.  The crunching of their feet on the road was the only sound.

“Well, nothing I guess.  To all appearances, nothing happens when you die“

“And what does one know when one is dead?”

“Nothing”

“Therefore” the wizard’s voice took on an authoritative ring, “To be, is to be alive. I AM equals I AM alive. There is no such thing as I AM DEAD. To be dead is to not know life and non-life. That is why life is infinite. As long as you know anything, you will know that you are alive”

“That’s not very good news” the Good Soldier said.

“No. Not to one with a belly full of injustice”

The Good Soldier was quiet for a moment. He wasn’t sure if the wizard was correct.

 “What can I do to stop this feeling?” The Good Soldier said at last.

 “Nothing”

The Good Soldier wiped his forehead, he dislodged some of the hardened dust but there was no sweat to wipe away.

“What about love?” The Good Soldier asked.

“Love is a constellation of traits inherited from others….Love is also the Great Alchemy, the Alchemy that transmutes Biology into Paradise....where only what matters, matters""

The Good Soldier nodded.

“Sadly, for you, you’ve inherited a poor collection of traits. Many of the inherited features that compose you have united for your torment”

“What do I do?”  The Good Soldier said.

“What does a good soldier do?” the wizard asked, his lips curled back from around his sharp teeth. The Good Soldier winced at the sight of the ugly smile. Then, without warning the wizard was gone and the Good Soldier found himself walking alone on the dusty road.  The sky was very yellow and the sun was hot on the back of his neck.  His mouth was dry and his boots felt like lead.

He kept walking toward the horizon.

His name was Steve, and he couldn’t take it anymore. He pictured himself growing old with her, while she grew old with him too. But he couldn’t grow old. Being immortal had its downsides. Now was his seven hundred years birthday and he was staring at her picture. He begged her to come back.

He thought he heard her voice when he shed a single tear and a slight breeze called him from the sea.



**Two**

He thought he heard her voice when he shed a single tear and a slight breeze called him from the sea. The windows of the room were open, and it would be a beautiful sight if he weren’t dying.
But he was dying. He was alone in the room, with wires spread all along his arms, and needles through his skin. He had that heart surgery, but apparently that new heart wasn’t working either and no doctor was able to tell the reason. The heart was beating irregularly, like a disabled man trying to walk. The heart was broken, so they tossed it out.

The man watched the sun go down as he breathed his last breath.



**Three**

The man watched the sun go down as he breathed his last breath.
He woke up and the room was full of light. There was something unrecognizably fluffy under his feet, like he was walking on cotton. A woman dressed in white was staring at him.
“Is she here?” he asked. “No, she’s not”. “Where is she?” “She’s never been around.” “I’m coming back.” “You can’t go back.” “I can’t stay here either. I have to go back to her. I have to go home.”
She smiled.

“Don’t be silly” she said. “Home is where your heart is.”



**Four**

“Don’t be silly” she said. “Home is where your heart is.”
He smiled to her, remembering an old song from U2 that had a verse somewhat like that one. He was holding his sweatshirt – which he didn’t even recall having. It had been with her for months.
-You sure you can’t stay with this? – He asked, shaking the sweatshirt stupidly – I won’t ever be able to use it again.
-I haven’t stretched it that much. – She said, pretending to be offended and repressing a smile, which he noticed.
-It’s not about that. There’s your perfume all over it.
She blushed and her eyes filled with tears.
-Nah, you’re gonna work it out. – Now she pretended to smile, repressing a tear.
Which he noticed.
-Yeah, you’re right. See you later. – He said unleashing a smirk.

Once she turned her back, he started crying.



**Five**

Once she turned her back, he started crying. He couldn’t let her leave like that. He wouldn’t let her leave like that.
-Please, please. – He yelled, running after her and grabbing her suitcases. – Stay. Please.
-Not anymore, Henry. I can’t do this anymore. 
-I’ll change.
-You can’t – She turned to him, picking up her baggage. – Neither can I. I’m sorry. – Her voice was hurt, and that was what truly hurt him. It cut his heart and soul and left him stranded by the door while she got in the cab and left.

He would never see her again.



**Six**

He would never see her again, and that was why he was holding her so tight.
-Do you swear you’ll come back? – She wouldn’t.
-I do, honey. It’s only for six months. – It wasn’t.
-Do you promise to remember me every day? – She wouldn’t.
-Of course I do. There’s nothing or anyone who can get you outta my head. – There was.
-No French guy? – No.
-No, you silly, no French guy, or American guy or any other kind of guy. – Yes.
-I’ll miss you. – True.
-I’ll miss you too. – True.

She had a nice life in Paris.



**Seven**

She had a nice life in Paris. She had a boyfriend and a dog; she was living with her parents and hanging around with good friends. Nothing could go wrong and she would never get hurt because she couldn’t feel anything.
Till a night a guy came along, and he had a broken heart. She realized she also had a heart, and her heart didn’t fit in Paris. Then her heart didn’t fit in the world. But her heart fit on his.
But he was broken, then so got she. Then he left her back in Paris, and she hoped Paris would be enough again someday.

He left back to the world, wandering brokenly ever after.

Exhaust

by Reines

	The autumn leaves. They spiral down like ballerinas from their wooden grip and land in the gentle mud. The soft earth embraces the trees fallen sons and daughters and shares with them their blessing. The blessing of not knowing how to feel. They don't know what it's like to wallow endlessly through the caverns of their own minds, the only glow being their mortification. Or have the memories that were once tucked away deep in the pockets of their skull rip out like vultures escaping the hellfire. 

                            It's her birthday today.
  
	I stare up at the desert of leaves above me. They stare back. The cool breeze breathes through the forest and carries my exhaled breath with it. I sit up.
	“It's gonna rain,” I say looking over at Samuel, the bottle of whiskey in my hand held tight, the revolver resting on my lap. “Yep. Gonna rain. I can always tell.” I laugh. “Let's go.”
	Samuel stands up and walks towards me. He rests his head on my shoulder before giving me a huge lick on my cheek, his tail wagging ferociously behind him.
	Standing up, I take the last swig of the bottle before hurling it into the wooden crowd. I tug on my plaid shirt, grab the gun, and pet Samuel on the head. He tries to lick my hand.
	“Good boy,” I say. He really is. We got him together, Sandra and I. It was the first thing we did together. Well, the first thing we did after we got married. The second thing we did was break each others' hearts. 
	One year. That's all it took to unveil the carnival of our doubts, troubles and demons. Our illustrations of a white picket fence were crumpled up like our noses along with the dreams of  conceiving anything innocent. The dreams of ever becoming a family. What was once a fortune of photo album smiles and rays of laughter were quickly dissolved into silent dinner conversations and lonely love making.

                           She left me.

	The brisk wind causes my hair to cackle and wave like fire, causing some of the leaves I gathered to flutter off the ground. Samuel smells something familiar. Something so recognizable that he starts to whine and slowly sniffs his way to the leaf pile. He digs, claws and eventually...finds her foot.
	I point the revolver at the dog. 
	“For what it's worth Samuel, you should probably let her be.” 
	A deep laugh takes the taste of whiskey off of my breath. Samuel stares at me, tail wagging, but he knows I'm serious. He's seen this gun before. His eyes drift to the foot, and then back at me. Deep, he stares, almost unrecognizable. Lost and confused, like when you realize your slimy, arrogant brother's sleeping with your wife. But then his tongue flops out and he smiles.
	“I could never kill you,” I say. Instead, I run my fingers down the cooling barrel, staring at it like I'm looking at an assortment of stolen memories...echoing out my name. The end of the barrel kisses the bottom my chin. My grip tightens.
	“Life. As cold as the rivers that cascade through my heart.” I smile as Samuel walks towards me. “Ah, it's gonna rain boy. I can always tell.” Samuel lies down at my feet.

Then you drop it down the toaster. The toaster takes approximately eighteen seconds to toast. You then put the top and bottom together, place them on a red tray and then cover the twelve buns that fit on the tray, 4x3,  with another tray and place them to the side. Once you are ready to make the sandwich you place two pickles on the bottom, no more than a quarter inch over lapping. Then you place the chicken filet with the smooth, round side facing up and then place the crown of the bun on top. Finally open up the sandwich bag allowing enough room for the sandwich to easily slide in, then fold the bag over twice and place it in the warming drawer for five minutes. Any sandwich that sits there for longer than five minutes gets trashed. If you would like a deluxe sandwich then place either a slice of American, provolone, or pepper jack cheese on top of the filet, then put two, whole, tomato slices on top of the cheese and two pieces of lettuce, shiny side up, that frame the bun on top of the tomatoes. Then repeat until your soul has been crushed, pissed on, and every dream and fire that has ever existed in you has been stomped out by the ceaseless, monotonous work you subject yourself to in order to not even get by. 
	
They, being the people who don’t work with you, will remind you that you chose to be there, just be thankful to have a job, or that it is just temporary. You know that isn’t true though. You can’t find a better job because you are working 50 hours a week and you are too tired to do anything else. You can barely even find the energy or will power to get out of bed in the morning. Every once in a while you feel like you have enough energy and fortitude to say enough is enough and move on but then you realize your life revolves around this job. All of your friends are there. They are the people that deal with all of the shitty customers who think they are the Queen of god damn England, the ones who think they own you because you stand behind a register. Your coworkers are the ones that after all the shit you put up with tell to forget the customer, he is an asshole, you didn’t do anything wrong, people like that just happen. You have a bond with your coworkers, like brother in arms who are united by their common misery. So the cycle repeats, week after week after week after week after week after week as if your days are manufactured on an assembly line.
	
Then you find yourself waking up in the tiny room you call an apartment. You shower and head to work and start your day off like you have the past, seemingly, five thousand days. You clock in, take your slip that shows the time you clocked in and put it your wallet. Then you say high to everyone. Then you either go to the kitchen or the front counter depending on what you are assigned that day. Then you spend the next ten hours slaving away like the robot you are. You listen to the exact same orders, make the exact same food and you have the exact same routine to live by. Then you watch your boss drive up in his new, gas guzzling behemoth of a truck and say “Hi!” to everyone as if he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world. It is as if he has no idea what the people he employs put up with on a daily basis. It is as if he hopes his friendly disposition will be contagious but what does he do besides sit in that office of his in the back while you are the one who gets burned at the fryers and the one who has to choose if it is worth turning the heat on at night. You are the one that has to decide whether or not to fix your car or just walk the five miles or so. The one who should just deal with the tooth ache or dish out the three thousand dollars for a root canal because god forbid giving his employees health insurance would just decimate his profits. No one likes the boss. 

Between the shitty boss, shitty job, and shitty house and lifestyle what can you find to be joyous about? You are simply a tiny little speck. In fact you aren’t even speck in the scheme of things. You are less than a pixel, you are less than even the red, blue, and green lights that make up a pixel. You are nonexistent and utterly replaceable and no one will notice if you go. Just like no one has noticed the billions of stars that have existed and perished and no one ever will. Just like no one ever notices the trillions of bacteria that are beneath our feet. That is what you amount to. At some point we have all been there. The thing is though that not all of us end there. That is the saving grace. There is a glimmer of a hope that one day you can escape the cycle of the daily grind. Get a degree if you are young enough, have a support system while you find a better job, or maybe you are stronger than most and do it all alone. 

Not everyone is lucky though. Sometimes the grind wears you down and grinds you to you are so thin that you become a part of the walls there. You are an everlasting stone that will be a part of where you are stuck, just like the walls. Bills add up and sooner than you know it you are living out on the streets and left with nothing but free time. Maybe you cope with a steady dose of drugs. Maybe you cope with a healthier method. Either way it leads to the same thing. If you aren’t apart of the club, the haves, then you better get used to meaningless, mindless tasks that ask nothing of you but obedience.  The boss, the haves, will tell you that working at these crummy soul devouring jobs is fine. What would they know about what you do though? It is not a matter of them being any less hard working but it is a matter of having something to show for it. If you work at a restaurant and you can’t even afford to eat there they pay you so little then what is the point? 

It gets to the point where thinking physically hurts. It breaks you just as bad as your job does. You think of all the things that you gave up, that you let slip by and you think never again will I let that happen, but it is too late. You have already buttered the buns. You have dropped them in the toaster. You have placed them on the tray. Put the two pickles on the bun, then the filet, and then the top part of the bun. You have wrapped the sandwich and placed it in the warming drawer until you throw it up for the next customer to devour or for it to get thrown away because it has been the warmer to long and has grown hard and unpleasant and unwanted.

Criticism is welcome, but please be kind. She e-mailed me this, so it's a rough draft.


“Alright, man, it’s been a long day. Time for me to make my exit!” Wyatt downed the last of his beer and decidedly plopped the pint glass down on the bar. He gestured for a bro-handshake toward the bartender.
“See ya, man,” said Greg, the bartender, and reciprocated the bro-man-shake. 
Jason waved casually and called out a brief salutation to a couple at the end of the bar who were engaged in a giggle-rich conversation.

Jason knew the bartender from back in his community college days, before he was even a bartender there. He knew most of the regulars too. The cozy neighborhood bar: a perfect place to chill with a drink after a long day. It was a good night. A trip was in the works with Greg to visit the guy’s brother in Texas. And he got the number of a pretty sweet piece of ass, good personality too. Jason stepped out into the cool, damp night and began the three-block strut home. Some quick movement caught his peripheral, but he paid no serious mind. It was probably some animal raiding the garages from the restaurants. The ones where people wasted half of their food because they were too rich to care about economics and wastefulness, and their appearances took precedence. Hmph, “high society,” to Wyatt, was simply a lack of common sense where narcissism took the place of thought processes. 

He passed a good-looking couple that looked healthy, clean, well off. Not a care in the world they had for a passerby. A counter point to the young couple was the man who passed by him next – a man that wasn’t quite yet middle aged, a little scruffy, a gate that adjusted to the clear burdens he carried throughout life, a gaze that seemed to look right through you, to see your true nature. 

Another brief movement caught his eye, a swift shadow that disappeared around the corner. Wyatt took a little more notice this time, but remained unconcerned. He swung right into his apartment building and gated up the stairs. It didn’t take him long to eject the shoes, shirt, and pants from his body. Surrendering the day to the night, he tumbled into bed and hastily threw his blanket over himself, already on the brink of snores. Right before his consciousness left him, he heard a barely audible voice… “Are you ready, Wyatt?”

He yawned and slapped both hands over his face and stretched his way out of bed. Time to get up and weld some shit. He didn’t like showering before work, since he was always getting sweaty. So he slathered on some deo, brushed his teeth, and put on some shitty, worn out clothes. He took notice of the nice sunny clear sky and retorted with a grin. Today seemed like a breakfast burrito and coffee day. He moseyed his way out the door. Wyatt then stopped short. Even his breath stopped. Everything around him was the same – same shops, same clear blue sky, same cars and streets. But the people… The peoples’ faces were all glowing. They all glowed in different colors and different intensities. But they ALL glowed. He just then realized in his half-asleep construction of the day, he never looked in the mirror. Wyatt whipped around and inspected his own reflection in the glass. Sure enough, his own face was glowing an intense yellow. His first thought went to the possibility of a hallucinogen. He felt fine before he went to sleep. And this theory wasn’t really viable, because everything else was completely normal, unlike the total world-altering effects of a hallucinogen. Was he going crazy? No family history of schizophrenia that he knew of. He stood panicking, staring around at all the colored, glowing faces that stared back in confusion, wondering why this man was in the middle of a crisis on such a normal day. This ws something he needed to figure out. Wyatt ran back upstairs to phone into work. He made up a lie about some stomach flu then sat on the edge of the bed – just sat for a moment, questioning the validity of his reality. He stood up slowly as if laboring to move through a pit of tar. That’s what this was, a tar pit of confusion and doubt. Taking leave of the heavy pit, his feet traveled hungrily and curiously toward the window for further investigation and confirmation. 

“Yep, still certifiably amok,” said his brain to his senses as he gazed out the glass. Was there some meaning to this? Had he somehow crossed over into another dimension? Wyatt decided that hell, if it was going to be this way, he needed to get IN it, see what this is all about. If this WAS some sort of other dimension, maybe he would have a really amazing job, and maybe the beer was better and the women were looser. Probably not, but there was no harm in hope. He descended the stairs to step back into the day to face the faces. They all glowed, as expected, and all in a wide variety of colors – some putrid in hue with a heavy glow, and others vivid and lively. 

He saw groups lunching outside and took note that many of the groups shared similar styles of light and intensity of color. Not all of them however, as there were groups of people that made up the colors of the rainbow. These people seemed to smile more often; their intensities took turns flickering brightest from one color or the next. That was another peculiar thing, the groups that WERE all the same color didn’t share intensities, just one person seemed to drain the others of their light, and all of them smiling less, the jovial nature decreasing as the glowing distributed itself to the one or two in the group. It was as if they didn’t want to give the light, and the person didn’t wish to receive it. Like being sapped for energy, then the energy becomes poison for the receiver. 

Jason decided that if this was going to happen, he wanted to explore as much as he could, discovering patterns and possibly uncovering a reason for why this was happening now. But first, he wanted to visit his father. His father drove truck, and 14 months prior had been in a bad semi accident, rendering him comatose. Jason liked to go visit his dad and imagined he could hear what Jason was saying, and tried to imagine him responding in some sort of telekinesis style of communication. It felt like it kept his heart strong to imagine his father, even while lying comatose, participating in some sort of active communication. He hopped onto the downtown bus that circled around downtown and ended at the second largest hospital in the city. 

He entered the rotating doors and immediately noted that the patients in their rooms, and the ones carted around on wheelchairs emanated a different type of light. Instead of beaming in sharp clouds of color, the seemed to drip slowly like waves of different, less brightly colored jellies. The elderly and the more apparently sick peoples’ glows were comparably slower than the children’s and the less severely injured patients’. It felt slightly comforting for him to find a pattern among the madness of the situation. 
Jason took notice of all the lights and flows and colors, on the way back up to his father’s room, a path he had come to know very well, from every nick in the wall to stain on the carpet and even some of the faces of the orderlies and staff that would frequent this particular path. On this particular day, however, he could see everyone in a little bit of a different light. The lights that emanated from the staff seemed to have a consistent glow, but it wasn’t exactly bright. It was duller, and faint. The visitors all varied in color and intensity, while in each of the rooms the lights from their faces took on varying colors but were all immensely faded, the most sickly patients seemed to barely glow at all. 

He stood outside of his father’s room a moment, almost frightened to see what condition of faded his father’s light could be. No matter what it was, it couldn’t be changed now. There was nothing he could do but observe. He took a deep breath and stood in the doorway staring at the floor. His eyes slowly reached his father’s bed. His tensed shoulders dropped. His father’s light seemed to be not quite perfect, but not as faded as he had feared. It was deep and purple, but bright enough not give Jason concern. He pulled his usual chair up to the side of the bed.

“Hi dad, it’s your son. I know I’m a little early, but I just really needed to talk to you.” His father’s light seemed to brighten a little at his words. ‘I woke up today, and everything was a little different. I don’t know if I’m going mad, or there’s something seriously wrong with me, or if it’s just something wrong with the rest of the world. Hell, it might even not be anything wrong with me or the world, maybe it’s just… changed… But dad, I can see everyone. Like, really SEE them. It’s not that I can see their insides, it’s more like, their insides are reaching out to me. Like their souls or whatever that even means. They’re all different colors, intensities, it seems like I can really see how they are, if they’re ok or not, if they’re good, or bad, predatory, good. I have to admit I was scared to come in here, dad, I was scared to see you. I was scared you’d be… faded. I know it, though, in my heart that you’re still here.” His father’s lights grew even brighter. ‘I love you, dad. I don’t know what this all means, but I feel like I’ve been shown something really valuable today. I’m not sure what I’m gonna have to do, or why it’s me, if I’m the only one. But I feel like I need to use this. I’m just glad you’re here to talk to.” 

Jason sat for a moment of reflection and relief that his father really was still there, and that he could see, with evidence, that he could also hear. Then began to go on about sports, his trip with Greg, and a few women – the normal things he would go in with. Then he leaned over and kissed his father’s head and gave his goodbyes before he ventured back out into the new world. 

He decided to go about his day as normal, and that entailed visiting his friend Greg. Everyone seemed to be getting off work. These people all remained a slight glow that was reminiscent of the sick. They all seemed tired and overworked, in their facial expression as well as their glow. It was clearly unhealthy, as unhealthy for the soul as sickness must have been for the body. He walked down to the bar, and was happy to see that his friend was indeed working. Something concerned him, however. His friend also had a glow, and the glow was a sickly, dull, yellow color, much the same as patients on the oncology floor at the hotel. He wondered if his friend felt this. Even if he did, he wouldn’t say anything. He wasn’t the type of man to worry about it. Still, Jason felt a deep pain in his heart. It may not be cancer, but his friend was still sick. He sat and drank a beer and chatted with his friend. He just wanted to laugh and bond with him as much as he could. He started feeling a small bit of acceptance underneath the pain, and decided it was time to find his own solace and reflection. 

He headed to the park for some serenity. He noticed some couples picnicking in the grass, some people with binoculars watching for birds and other animals, some people playing with their dogs, and some children simply playing in nature. They all had something in common, their glowing auras were all very strong and colorful. Their smiles at one another even intensified their glory. When the people first came into the park, they had similar differences as the folks that meandered around the streets. However, as they allowed themselves to bond more and more with nature, they began to change into stronger, brighter souls – that couldn’t help but to shine in the way they were intended. 

He decided that maybe this was the way it was going to be forever, or maybe this would pass, but that it was happening, and there was really nothing he could do about it. He did know, however, that he felt exhaustion. He began his route home, taking notice of all the different glows of the people, and what that meant for their inner state. Some were at peace, some were drained, sick, overworked, joyful, and everything in between. It gave him a fine insight, and an opportunity to help people become their true light, if he decided to use it in that way, which was really only right, as his father would tell him. The father that he now knew could feel him there even in his deep sleep. 

He turned the corner and passed down an alley, taking a small notice of something moving in the distance. It was similar to the movements he previously ignored the night before this oddity happened to him. This time he faced it. He walked down into the alleyway and approached the area behind a dumpster that concealed the movement. As he approached, however, there grew a great and white glow. It was a glow with such intensity that actually produced a sound. He felt it warning him to stay away from it. It didn’t seem to want to be approached, but instead wanted to be the one to come to him. The source was so unknown, and if it didn’t want to be bothered, there was no telling what would occur. So he turned back away from the alley and went home. It was unnatural to disturb whatever lurked behind that dumpster. 

He walked along his way home and went back to bed. As he slowly fell asleep he thought he heard a voice in the distance. “You see, son, it’s always been this way, you’ve just been so blind. Now you can see, and now you must do.” And he fell asleep until the morrow.

Now for the **[WARNING]** bit, this story is a graphic first person telling of a child killer; he's based off of Albert Fish so he does eat them. Lastly this is an ongoing project, all criticism or advice is greatly appreciated.

A stone cell

Each stone in the wall had more age and life than I could comprehend, my fingers play upon the cracks careful not to break the aged lines. My hands find themselves tired searching every message these rocks have to give, nails run raggad clicking in rythem to the music preserved to each crack, like each note to a score. My wrists hurt from the shackles bound to them, their embrace neither tight nore loose. The pressense enough to remove any will to break the binds, or even to perppetuate an imagination capable of the thought to escape. 

The air so thick from a rippled blanket of decay, my nose burnt by the remains of those I once considered brothers. No family behind these walls, no blood between those too weak to shed it. To say that a life without these walls isn't but a distant memory is a mockery of what I've suffered here. Every second of my life prior to its cage blazes past my eyes in patterns so inense that I've lost the sight for anything else. My memories of the is world as I now know it are by no means a life to live, regardless of how long my stay is to be, I was dead long before my last breathe. 

My mind still in its endless walts at intances takes certain pauses, eyes of miasmic storms just large enough to allow awarness. During these opressive voids, I torment myself with the beckoning of questions. As my body turns to dust, I always have the same inquarie, forever wondering why had this not happened sooner? Had my life been ended early, the temptation of a return would be weaker, the husk left behind stronger enough to face its abysmal excistance.

Mercy be it too sacred of word to pass these pale lips, I have known my deeds as foul from their conception to their sin soaked execution. The eyes of my victims forever surround my walls, pealing away at the unstable sanity that had been clung to with a feveroris grip. 

As I would ask the same given the placement of your eyes, I wasn't born into confinement nor was I placed by a careless agent of justice; I defined the layer of hell that holds me. Innocence was the target of my wrath, I could not say it was taken as I didn't leave a single drop to exist. 

The year of our lord where I resided, I walked among the alleys, and the sewage that fell upon them; a voyeur to society and its civilized inhabitants. Give it not the size, one could not see difference between my brethren and the bloated rats that plagued the streets.

Do not attempt sympathy, or consider my bedfellows the reason to this corrupted path I limp through. Given the choice between lands of furnishing or moist decay, I'd always take the latter; more freedom  to be true to my manners. Secondly a demon be it dressed in rags or lace is still a forked tongue devil, as I've seen my same wrong doings in the eyes of others. 

We all have our vices, as we all worry to what ends we'll be drowned by them; my personal brand was the hands of the young and unwilling. While my mind never had been upon other thoughts, I was only spellbound via eclipsed moments where the thought of not would sear until I had begun. At this point I was taken, my body moonlit to another, a beast of sin and flesh.

While I knew the crime being committed, I was never ostrisised by the lingering eyes, only by the broken symphony in my head. It was not until my hands fell upon royal blood did a whisper of my existence fall among the civilized. Yet the sin itself felt no worse than anything I had done thus far. Her cries no more refined, her tears no less salty, and her blood showed no sign of any more imperfection compared to even my own. Her flesh bore little resistance to teeth, as is the same for the rest.

Once I awoke from my lustful haze, I began the process to hide my shame while also immortalizing it all. There was a shelf in an abandoned shack of which I considered my abode, on said shelf were little trinkets set in neat little rows. The only vanity I held was for these treasures, each one from each potential full life lived who crossed my gaze. My favorite was a set of pearls as I had taken a foster role for a time with this child, they enjoyed walking the shores and these pearls were a present from them.

My method of disposal is simplistic while just as vile as the first act, as we humans have the same savory taste of pork, the trick is merely to complete the illusion. The easiest method is to have the remains submerged in scolding water until even the bones are the consistency of soup, as for the head however there a problem arises. My method of habit is to sever the cheeks, nose, and ears as they are still succulent; with the rest I make a contribution to the gullets of the wild including their clothes. Children were always told to stay away from the forest, such tales humane compared to my own sins.

After the clean up for this child, with body set to roast I took to her clothing, the nobility was off putting however I couldn't see how countless youth being taken prior would have any less ramifications. That's when my gaze focused on the crest upon the late child's locket, while I knew nothing regarding politics of this country, I was very aware I was staring at the crest of the king.  

I sat ever so still, in naive hopes that may also soon pass. Night was still defended, but it didn't matter anymore, the child of royalty was dead and my hands more so than ever were stained. 
I knew I had to attempt something, so after hours petrified in fear I ran to the forest with the child's clothes and partial remains.  

The forrest reserved no strength against me, the long reaching arms of the trees tearing away at me, the howling faces in their knotted bark. Voices of the vacant were nothing new to me, however nothing of this intensity. 

""He's here!"" ""Burn the demon!"" ""Kill him, rip him limb from limb!""

The voices fell to whispers and quieter still as I reached my planned resting grounds. I marked these grounds by a rusted spade set to a rotted stump, while I never used it to turn soil as the point was to give the illusion of the corpse being taken by wolves. 
After hours of toiling finding a suitable place for the remains, I came upon uplifted roots that had been shaped in such a manner to only allow access to that of a child. I placed her face down into the roots, and shredded her clothing haphazardly from there.

As the last bit of cloth was placed I filled my lungs for what felt as new a experience, my flesh constricted from the night's in forgiving chill, never have my hands felt so unclean, my mind with such unrest. As my heart began to slow I heard a voice, to my dismay it was not of my own corrupted design.

""Damn fucking snakes, get away from me!""

To what ends will I be tested this day I thought, no one of sound mind traverses these woods, so this voice was not of an innocent man. Regardless of their transgressions I had to act as I did not want her to be found premature.

I took towards the voice careful not to be revealed, as I crept closer still the voice still proclaimed on about the serpents. I was finally able to lay sight on the figure, he stood seven heads tall, 
dressed in fatigues of a royal guard. I sat still for moment to calculate my next action, as were it to be too rash I'd find my head on the chopping block. On one hand I've committed no wrong doings to his knowledge, however I parish the thought as no innocent men traverses these woods, unless hunting the wicked. 

I know what needed to be done to rid myself of this trial, I turned back to the resting grounds as I required a tool to complete the task.

It's not particularly good, but oh well.
    
    
Regret? Maybe. The consequences were expected but were not planned for, nor were they properly thought through.  After all when actions are spontaneous the long-term effects are often overlooked in favour of the short term gain. What were the short term gains? Experience, mostly. Not as in experience in performing such acts but emotional experience, the ability to extend the extent to which one can truly be empathetic towards another person. You see many people say they have felt all alone in the world, that they have felt isolated from the rest of humanity, but in truth their claims are lies. For many of them the feeling of loneliness was an exaggeration of their feelings. There would most likely be someone there for them be them parents, partners friends or mere acquaintances. In order to feel truly lonely all human relations, all ties to the world must be removed. In order to remove friends I simply stopped seeing them. I skipped school, didn’t attend their parties until they all forgot about me. Children are like that. To remove my parents something more drastic had to be done. My parents couldn’t be made to forget my existence and I could not run away since I would not be able to survive. In order to achieve a higher degree of understanding I had to remove my parents without changed my own situation. Of course, you know how I did this so there’s no point retelling my tale is there? But afterwards I truly felt lonely. I had no one to help me, no one to rely on or look up to. There was just me and the absence of everyone else. I was like that until you found me, I can’t quite say how long that is, but now I can say that I have felt true loneliness and can practice a higher degree of legitimate empathy with others. Of course, this is all just a theory. In practice, who knows, perhaps it backfired. Regardless I cannot say I regret what I did, but nor can I say that I remember it fondly. A sad memory, perhaps? A story to tell to others? Only time will tell.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_17ltu5,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/17ltu5/regret/,

I had run away from my home. I'm sick of all the lies my 'role models' tell me. My name is Jonathan Suburbia. My friends at my homeland called me the Jesus of Suburbia. I miss my friends at home. The name of it is pointless now. Here in America, I have nothing. I do blend in well as a regular white suburban teenager, living in a ordinary suburban town called Longview, California, and; blgahagah! I am sick being a normal American Idiot! 
Then it happened. As I was deep in thought, I crossed the street, then a white Ford SUV came and hit me. My body buckled like I had been shot with a shotgun in the chest. I hit my skull on the hood and then the pavement below me as I fell to the floor in pain. I'm not sure if I blacked out from the pain or got knocked out from me hitting the car and the pavement. 
When I woke up I was in St. Jimmy's National Hospital. I as I came to I heard this voice in my head, a voice that I have never heard in my life, raging and rebelling against everything that I kept secreted in my mind. It hurt. Then a nurse came over to my cot and spoke to me. I noticed her name tag hung from a lanyard around her neck. Her name was Maria Liberty. She was a sight to behold after what happened to me. She said,"" Good mourning John!"" Her smile probably cured a case of cancer at one point. I know it stopped my headache. 

After a bit of routine vital signs check, Maria helped me off the cot and into a wheelchair. We made idle conversation as she brought me into a room with a two men and women, sitting at a table together. One man just stared at me. I knew that disappointed face from anywhere. It was Brad. My stepfather. He always seemed to be neglecting me and me being around him made him very angry. He looked disgruntled and unhappy about me still being alive and breathing. My mother's face was red and her eyes were wet with tears. The other man turned out to be a doctor. He was was a bald old man with glasses. He smiled gently at me as he looked up from his clipboard. He turned his glance toward Maria, my parent, and THAT other person, and motioned for them to talk with him. Being the eavesdropper I am, I listened closely. 
""Mr. and Ms. Suburbia, John has suffered a major blow to his brain after his accident,"" he said sympathetically. ""He now has permanent damage to his prefrontal cortex, deep limbic system and his temporal lobes. These are the parts of the brain that essentially control our emotions,"" the doctor said sternly. ""I'm sorry to say this; but your son now has a multipersonality disorder. We have had cases like this in the past and we call it Saint Jimmy's disorder."" The doctor's voice began to crack. ""Your son is expected to live for 1 year.""


The voice in my head begins to take control of me. It tells me this,"" That's a lie Jesus! They just want your parents money! The government just wants your money!"" I didn't know what to think of it so I let out an enormous scream. I shouted to St. Jimmy,"" GEEEETTTTT OOOOOUUUUUUTTTTTT!!!! My Mom and Brad jumped and so did Maria. I was pale and breathing heavy. Maria came over and sat down on my lap. When she sat down St. Jimmy disappeared. POOF. Out of my mind. I started to relax as she put her hand on my cheek and rubbed her thumb back and forth on it. We shared a moment, alone in the world. Then the doctor cleared his throat and spoke. ""It seems John's disorder disappears when Maria is around him,"" He said with a smile. ""I think we will start the therapy with Maria accompanying John."" He turned his glance at me and said,""There maybe hope for you yet, John.""

After that ordeal was over and done with, my parent gave me some money so grab some food at the Cafe. I brought Maria with me. I asked her what she does for a living. She says she interns here, but that's not her real job. I asked her what it was and said,"" How about you come with me to work tonight, John?"", she said with mischievous smile. She saw the worried look on my face and said,""Don't worry it's not like we are going to get caught."" I thought to myself, she's a rebel all right. Later that evening she appeared outside my door. She was the definition of an angel. She was wearing a pair of skinny jeans with a men's black button-up shirt with a red tie on it. Her hair was in a pony tail and on her lips was the reddest lip stick I've ever seen. Her top two buttons on her shirt were unbuttoned so I could see a bit of hear cleavage. She teasing me, I thought. Jimmy had something to say too. ""It's not going to work John. She's not your kind of girl."" I fire back at Jimmy,"" I will make her mine! Jimmy had enough. He took control and told her to wait a second and guided me inside. He sat me down at the dinner table. He said,""Look Jesus, I know your exited about 
dating... Ms. Whatsername out there. But your no rebel, you have no guts. I backed off today to see what you would do. AND YOU DID SHIT ALL! Let me show you how to give Whatsername the time of her life."" My head started to ache. I am now St. Jimmy. I picked myself up and took some Novacaine and rejoined Whatsername outside. She was about to say something but my lips stopped her and she closed her eyes. We hurry along in a taxi to a club in town. We go inside and she disappears among the crowd. I find her again and shes with a white guy with dreadlocks. She was sitting on the floor getting high on weed.  Her top is unbuttoned and her bra is on the floor next to her underwear. She offers the blunt to me and I accept it. Jesus in says in my head, ""Don't do it Jimmy! We are going to get in trouble!"" I take a big sniff of air and start to feel the effects. I sink to the floor next to Whatsername and lean my head against her shoulder. She tells the white guy to get us a drink. He comes back and we drink until we get wasted to the point where she kicks a stripper off of her place and replaces her. And does better. Then I hear the sounds of sirens outside.

 Jesus says to me,""SHIT! We are done Jimmy; it's over."" I thought of any way out and I saw a the fire door identified by a red EXIT sign. I quickly picked up Whatsername while she was still giggling drunkenly from all the booze we drank tonight. She cussed at me for taking her away from her position as the center of attention to the male patrons at the club. I made a break for the door, when Jesus said something,"" D-DUDE! That door has an alarm on it!"" I disregarded his warning and burst through the door carrying Whatsername in my arms. Then the bell sounded. The sprinklers came on and tried to put out a fire that didn't exist. I could hear the people screaming from the water getting soaked. I laughed to myself as I ran. I ran to my home and never looked back. I layed Whatsername on the couch. She said as her eyes closed,""Best 20 minute date I've ever had."" I buttoned her shirt back up and sort of just drooped down to the floor and passed out. I could tell Jesus was impressed. Maybe even jealous.

 I woke up with the biggest headache ever, probably from Jimmy and... her, going to the club and getting drunk of their asses. Also, Jimmy had gone to sleep for today, he told me in my dreams. I was in control for today. I saw her get up, stretch and let out a big yawn. She rubbed her eyes and then her neck, probably from bunking on the couch all night. She looked really hungover. I said smoothly,"" Good mourning, sleepyhead."" ""Mourning Jimmy,"" She says half asleep. Then she realizes that Jimmy is not here but instead it was the non-rebelous  John Suburbia. She smiled kindly at me and then I heard HIM come down the stairs. Brad came down the stairs to see us sitting next to each other in a moment. His face swells up with anger at me. Probably from the sight of ME being with a girl that was AMAZING. ""JOHN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO HER?!!"", he bellowed. ""SHE'S YOUR NURSE NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND!!!!"" I called for St. Jimmy in my head to help me but he told me sort it out myself. I took a deep gasp of air and while he was still babbling, I let out at the top of my lungs,""Listen asshole, she is mine and you can't say otherwise! I am TIRED of you neglecting me and you telling me what to do. Hell, your not even my dad. You just married my mom that I love, oh so much, so you could sleep with her!!! You know what we are done here! Maria... let get the hell out of here."" I could see him beginning to swell up with anger as me and Maria walked out the door. To my surprise he seized me by the by the collar of my shirt and held me against the wall next to the door. He called for my Mom. As soon as she came down the stairs I curled my fist and hit him square in the nose. I heard the *crack* as his nose bent and broke. He released me and I ran out the door with Maria at my heels. We stopped at after a few blocks to catch our breath. Maria asked,""Jesus is going to be jealous after that Jimmy."" I laughed and then said,""That was me, the Jesus of Suburbia.""

He wondered aimlessly. He didn’t think. Thinking took too much effort and the thoughts it created were not worth venturing down quite yet. He just walked because that was all he could do. His phone was in his pocket and he endured the cold while he waited for it to ring. The breeze ran down the street and bit and tore until it bit into his skin. He was not walking to anywhere in particular or for any other reason than to stall. The streets were deserted and the park by the lake contained nothing but the geese lagging behind on their journey south. 
	
His mind trailed off. Where could she be? What could she be doing? When was the last time I saw? Does she even want to see me? Am I simply just wasting my time? No, no, no he thought, don’t let your mind wonder off. Thinking hurts too much. She cannot just be gone without a goodbye or a mere fare thee well. 
	
Nine p.m. he said. We will go to the movies, and then have dinner. It would be wonderful. Reality versus expectations- they are never the same. He approached the pond and walked down the hill till he was on the middle of it. He sat down and looked out across. It was calm except for the ripples caused by the wind. The silence was the best part. Silence was a commodity he longed for. He felt his phone in his pocket and looked at the time, ten-thirty. No missed messages, no missed calls, not anything. He put it away and stared at the light on the other side of the lake. He wrapped his hands around himself and stuck them under his arms to stay warm and waited for a call.
	
Ten-forty-five. At ten-forty-five it finally arrives. The phone rings and he answers. Contempt, hate, rage, and longing coursed through him. He doesn’t speak immediately. Control is important, nothing good comes from impulse. “Hello my dear. Is it as I fear? Will I still see you here?”
	
“No my love, I am coming now. I’m sorry, I am sorry I took so long. The people I was with just kept rambling on and on, like loons, but don’t be mad, I will be beside you soon.” 
	
A consolation time, being second, what else should one expect?  Don’t expect anything and you will never be disappointed he always said. “Okay then. It was your time, and never mine, but yours to spend. I just thought it was on you that I could depend.”
	
He let the cold slip in further. His ears went numb, then his cheeks, and then his toes. Finally he stood up and proceeded home. He opened the door and the warmth escaped out. The couch welcomed him, and hugged around him when he sat down. Eleven o’clock his phone said now. Better late than never he thought. Then twelve came around. Then one, and then finally his eyes fell shut and he gave up. 
	
He woke up with hands running through his hair. Cold hands. He looked up and saw her. The smile crept across their faces as the stared. “Hello my love,” he said looking above, “why have you taken so long?”
	
“Because here dear, is not where I belong. You have known this for far too long. Yet I always must come along, to remind you. That I am always here. I am always there. A reminder to you that things only get colder and harder, but never darker” 
	
“But my love you must explain. Why am I in so much pain? Why must you always delay?  I have love for you that cannot be swayed, but I would rather just end this masquerade. I would rather you just have always stayed.”
	
And one day soon. That will happen for you. Though it may hurt, I promise you will just simply awake. With my hand in your hair and a smile in which we both partake. And I won’t be cold. I will be something you can actually hold. And be far more than Lenore or some forgotten lore. I will be yours.”
	
And then she was gone. He felt his head. It was still cold. He checked his phone and saw no calls. No messages. Nothing at all. Nothing at all to ease his mind. So he lay there, just trying not to think .

It was a breezy day, and the shifting grass seemed to shy away from him as he made his slow voyage across the plain. He was a tall man, well tanned from being in the sun for long hours, and his face had crinkled into an expression of age and rugged wisdom. His body was strapped in torn leather, and his facial hair suggested a few days of no shaving. In his right hand he bore a walking stick, sharpened at the end to a point, like a spear. A holster hung about his waste, and in it, a 10 millimeter Bren Ten, with a single clip left to use.

Hoping to find some much needed supplies, the man continued his trek, glancing between the skyline of ruined towers, and the great mountains beyond them. A sign, eroded by age, read in large white letters “Welcome to Denver.” He heard of the place before. They used to call it the “mile high city,” but that was long ago. Back when he had friends.

He had been the first male born to his tribe, he recalled, and he was called ""blessing"" by many. They told him the stories of how the great tribes fell, and the towers became empty. They told him of sky people, who had come down to the earth and snatched its inhabitants. But in defiance, they fought back and were swiftly annihilated. Seeing their potential slaves mostly dead, the sky people fled, and left them to their ruined home. 

His tribe were his friends. But his friends had sent him out here, out West. He was to find civilization, and return to save his people. But more and more he feared that there was no civilization to be found.

So now there were no friends. It had been a long time since he had heard the sound of another voice. His own often provided that helpful second opinion. He liked his voice, but he often remembered his friends’.

 Thinking of these things made the trip seem shorter, and he soon found himself amongst the great tombs of skyscrapers, monuments to a greater time. The man saw nothing but rubble and trash, nothing worth collecting. He kept on, his spear held tightly in his hand. Who knew what monster may inhabit these crypts? The place was deathly quiet; the only sound was the slight rustle of the wind upon the grass. But his ears perked up as a piece of rubble fell out of place.

Stopping, the man looked around, until he saw a figure reveal itself in the shadow. A friend…finally? No. A bullet whizzed past his head. He dropped the spear, and quickly whipped out his pistol. Taking aim as the figure approached, he discharged a bullet. But in the mere sliver of time before he pulled the trigger, he saw the figure’s face. It was a woman, a beautiful woman, not scarred by the brutal reality of this hostile wasteland. He could not cut down such beauty; his heart would not allow him, even for survival. His hand moved the slightest inch out of line as he fired, and the bullet sailed off, striking nothing.

She fired back, this time not missing. He felt the hot lead hit his chest, and the pain seared him. Dropping his gun, the man slowly bent down on one knee, and then another. He grasped at his chest, and began to breathe raggedly. He could feel his heart hurting. As he fell backwards to the ground, tears began to form in his eyes. As the darkness began to surround him, he felt not fear, but joy. He wished the woman a farewell in his mind, and hoped she lived to escape this harsh place. With his last breath of life, the man looked up at the great towering tombstones, and to the clouds beyond.

“It is fitting,” thought he, “to die in a graveyard.”

The warmth on Lauriel’s face lifted her spirits. Her garden was finally returning to an approximation of its former glory; rose bushes breathing color into a space that for so long had been a gray wasteland. Her favorite vine was growing, too, not yet more than a few buds at the base of the lattice she’d put up earlier that week. She would teach it to weave as it grew.

A baby’s cry broke through her serenity, and Lauriel smiled; *I must teach you to grow too, little one. You will have a whole new world to weave through.* 

The pristine click of the garden gate filled the air with something Lauriel ascribed to coziness. She couldn’t say the same for the old street lamp out front. The road it had once faintly illuminated was gone, reclaimed by the earth. A testament to the strength of our makers, she thought as she turned and started to climb the porch stairs.
	
Lauriel didn’t notice the rain as it fell at the base of the lamp post; or the puddle the rain formed as it pooled and ran off an unseen edge. Even as she turned back briefly, on the thought of having heard something peculiar, she did not see it. The rain had by then flickered and vanished; much the same as the light from the bulb above.

The little cobble streets that bob and teeter like a broad with a gut full of beer have become otiose, wringing not person, other than the cheese maker of hungry french memories.

Horny lads, feet clicking, cluck, cluck, as they sauntered sheepishly in the evening, searching for a lass to loosen their wallets for.  The new age saunterers in their barely worn pea-coats, pry grimaces from the cheese maker.  The sound of flats and flimsy conversation bouncing off the old street and into the cheese maker's ears.  He hated them.  

The cheese maker had lived alone since his wife had died 8 years ago.  I would see him now and then as he stopped in the diner I worked at and had a cup of coffee.  Nobody really knew his name.  Nobody really cared enough to inquire.  His presence seemed to go unnoticed as he strolled through town.  Maybe he likes it that way.  

I called him the cheese maker because that had been his profession.  He owned a small farm outside of town that he had purchased after returning home from WWII.  His sons ran the farm now and they routinely delivered the cheese and milk we used in the diner.  They had booted their father out into a nursing home.  I learned all of this because they would engage in small talk with my manager who was an old childhood friend of theirs.  

I can't tell you exactly why I had become so infatuated with his life story.  I would get off work and walk past his nursing home.  Sometimes I would see him out and about, smoking a cigar outside a grocery store, or rummaging through a thrift store.  I never had the audacity to approach him.  

It's been a few weeks since I last seen him, sipping on his coffee.  I wondered where he had been.  What he had been doing since he left the diner.  I finished my shift without one sight of him.  As I was walking home, I heard a yelling sound coming from the yard of the nursing home.  I moved in closer to get a look.  

It was the cheese maker and another elderly man yelling back and forth at each over the white picket fence built around the nursing home.  ""You filthy fucking rat!"" stammered the cheese maker.  ""Don't call me a rat, you goddamn wrinkled shit.""  I hid behind a tree and listened as best I could.  ""She loved me, Chester.  She was married to me.  She had my children."" said the cheese maker.  ""You only stole her from me!  She was going to marry me, if I hadn't thrown my ring into that goddamn stream!"" yelled chester in fury.  

""I go to her grave every morning.  And you, the guy she married won't even bother to visit her!"" ""FUCK YOU, CHESTER, FUCK YOU, you sniveling little fuck.""  The cheese maker picked up a rock from the ground and hurled it at chester.  The rock missed chester and landed in the street behind him.  By this time, the care taker's had come out and were ushering the cheese maker, who was mumbling curses, back to the house.  

Chester inched his way down the sidewalk past me.  He had a cane in his left hand and leaned half his body on it as he walked.  He didn't see me and I passed him and went home.  I was so fascinated.  The two men, in this perpetual state of conflict all over a woman that had passed away years ago.  

A few weeks had passed since their last quarrel.  I couldn't pacify my intrigue.  The sullen moments at work and the blandness of the regular social interactions between people left me craving their passion, their hatred.  I began cutting by the nursing home more and more often.  Checking to see if they would be there yet again, like a rerun of an old show. 

Then one day he appeared.  The cheese maker himself.  He waddled into the diner and sat in his regular spot and ordered a black coffee with two sugars.  I brought it out to him.  He didn't look at me.  He stared straight out the window, almost as though he was expecting someone to walk in.  He finished his coffee and left. 

Chester had died that day.  I read it in the obituary later that night.  He had a bad heart they said.  I thought this was ironic.  I went to the burial.  I stood in the back away from everyone else.  I took a cigarette out and puffed on it.  I looked over to my left and noticed the cheese maker walk up beside me.  ""You got another one of those?"" he asked motioning towards my pocket.  ""Yeah, sure.""  I handed him a cigarette and we both stood there silently.

A tear rolled down my father’s cheek while my grandmother continued to gently sway her nails back and forth across his back like she did years before – like he’s done to me. Then my extraneous thoughts meandered their way back into my head like usual. It dawned on me that that would be among the last moments I spend with her. I realize how lucky I am to have been there. 
	 My grandma has always said that she loves New York, having only gone but a handful of times in the entirety of her life. She has also loved seeing her son perform, listening to beautiful music, and other forms of art. Married at 18, and having a child soon thereafter, she never got to experience the things that could bring her as much joy as her family. I will always wonder if she lived without regret.
	I looked down at her hand – discolored, weakened and wrinkled. I could just hold it in my young and hearty hand with time to spend written all over it effortlessly. We could join as a crossroads of relatives and of diversity - her at the ending of her life, and me very much at the beginning of mine.  Because of my mother and father’s education, as well as my own, I stand here now with more opportunity than she received in all of her years combined. I will always wonder if she lived without regret. 
	“But,” she says, “It’ll just take time for it to get better.”  Hope, even then. She let out one of her light laughs that just roll their way out into the space of your ears. It’s comforting to feel that from her. We all gave a slight chuckle, but we knew that it would not get better.  It had been said many times just that day that we’ll have to sacrifice her quality of life for it to be sustained. 
	Going to visit her was one of the most powerful and important times in my life. I learned firsthand the circle of life. When you’re there and you know that the days your loved has left are vastly outnumbered by that he or she has lived, you accept it. You have always known that it would happen, no matter how fucking painful it is and how completely powerless you are over the situation. 
It’s just life and that’s all it will ever be – from birth to death.  It’s all we, as humans here on this planet will ever really know in the concrete. Have faith, but be content. Look forward to a better time, but know that there is always a now.  There will be a time to say goodbye to everyone you’ve ever met. Take it, and be grateful.

The leftover rain on his coat slowly dripped onto the carpeted hallways as he walked on, casually and relaxed. He breathed in deeply and smiled. Nothing like the smell of rain. It had to be one of his all-time favorite smells, along with mint leaves and sticky raspberry yogurt.
 
Was sticky a smell? Aaron entertained that thought long enough to admit that it was, well, a stupid thought. He was beginning to think that he was recently having one too many of those. Taking out his keys, he quietly unlocked the door, grasping the smooth metal handle carefully as he did. Trying to sneak in on Bruce was always impossible, but he always tried anyways.
 
He opened his door to find his roommate waiting for him. Aaron smiled, white teeth contrasting with his dark complexion. “You know, one of these times I’m gonna do it.”	Bruce, wearing his typical bored expression, simply shook his head and sat back down on the couch to resume his game. Aaron also shook his head, still grinning, as he walked into his room. Dropping his backpack with college books with a muffled thump, he plopped down on his soft bed. He could already feel the energy draining from his body. It had something to do with the bed, he figured. In another minute he would be too tired to get up for anything.
 
“Amanda came over,” Bruce called from the other room. “She was looking for you.”	Aaron shot straight up, suddenly full of energy again. Amanda with the great legs. Amanda the woman from 3B. Amanda, the reason he had almost taken up dancing. Amanda with the great legs.
 
The legs were worth mentioning twice.
 
“What did she say?” he asked, trying to sound uninterested. He failed miserably.
 
“If you are so excited, why don’t you ask her yourself?” the blond haired Caucasian answered, his attention never leaving the game.
 
“What makes you think I’m excited?”
 
Bruce looked up at him for a moment. “Maybe the fact that you practically teleported from your bed to the couch when I mentioned her name.”
 
Damn.
 
Aaron leaned back onto the couch and let out a sigh. “Is it that obvious?”
 
“Only to people with eyes.”
 
Aaron rolled his eyes. “So what did she want?” He asked once more, his curiosity beating out his pride.
 
“Something about wanting ‘to see the world’.”
 
“... And?”
 
Bruce looked at his friend once more. “You don’t actually think I was paying attention to her words, do you Aaron?”
 
""You're an ass.""

""I know.""
 
“Did you at least get your eyes off of her body long enough to know where she is right now?”
 
Bruce thought for a moment. “I believe she was heading back to her room. That would be the first place I would check for her.”	Aaron was almost out the door by the time his friend finished talking.
 
Taking the hallway down to the elevator, he pushed the arrow a few too many times. It was only after he was inside did he realize how he was acting.	“Man, get a hold of yourself,” he mumbled, his palm on his forehead, as he tried to regain some composure. “She just wants to talk, maybe she saw your game last week. Or needs help with the writing assignment.”  He paused for a moment. “Yeah, she doesn’t need your help.”
 
When the elevator doors opened, Aaron was once again calm and controlled, with the exception of his extremely wide eyes. The sunglasses could fix that.
 
He knocked on the door, then rested back on his heels, trying to look as comfortable as possible. Two seconds later, it opened.	She was wearing volleyball shorts. At this moment, Aaron was very thankful he was wearing the sunglasses. Her long, blond hair ran just to the middle of her back, and was complimented by her beautiful blue eyes. Her whole figure was, well, amazing; not a toothpick, but athletic, curvy. Even her nose was attractive, and her lips looked great, smiling and forming words...
 
Shit, she was saying something.
 
“... said that you were out.” she finished, still smiling at him in that cute way, her eyes twinkling. She had one hand resting on her hip as she leaned against the door frame, looking like a model. Aaron stopped himself before going into another embarrassing lapse of attention.
 
“Yeah, I just got back from class. So what’s up?” he asked. He was getting better at this.
 
“Actually, I was just wondering what Mr. Hassle gave in our class yesterday. I missed it ‘cause of a dentist appointment.”  Aaron looked at her for a moment, then leaned onto his heels once more.
 
“Yeah, I’ll bring it over after dinner if you want.”  Stay calm, stay calm.
 
“Thanks,” Amanda said, her smile returning even brighter. “I appreciate it.”
 
“Yeah, no problem. Oh, and what was that you mentioned about seeing the world, or something?”
 
Amanda stared at him for a moment, confusion written on her face. “I’m not sure what you’re talking about,” she answered slowly, still smiling.
 
He was gonna kill Bruce.
 
“You know what, don’t worry about it. I’ll see you after supper,” Aaron called as he turned toward the elevator once more. Finally, a study date with Amanda, sort of. This day just got about a million times better.
 
Now all he had to do was find a way to hid Bruce’s body, and the day would be perfect.

He stood in the blackness, his lips pursed together in a defiant sneer against the night. A soft sound escaped his lips, a pliant, fleeting tone that slipped through the night like the soft cries of a cornered prey. But it was with that sole musicless tone that he fought the night. It was like a dirge to him, a requim to be repeated over and over lest a chaotic fate take his life, some form of protection. The night carried dangers, of course. The night always carried danger, slow predators, fast prey, the ever present spiral of life and death. The forest in the distance was a trap. A slow death for those found within, pressed by others who would take their life for sustenance, and by the slow grind of the human machine which presses in on the trees like a vice, both metaphorical and not. The roads nearby hummed with motorcycle engines and the low drum of tractor trailers. The night was barely audible. The trees' rustle was sorrowful, as though they were aware of the sparse environment in which they grew. Perhaps they knew that their seeds, their children, would find pavement and poison. Perhaps plants were aware of the damage we did them. Perhaps not.



These were not the questions that He pondered as his tones and scales passed into the night. The question he pondered was a simple one. Does the night threaten, or protect? If a man finds his way into the forest at night, can he use the night as another tool, like a hammer to be weilded against the nails of the world? Humans were so good with tools. They used their world and changed their world and were positively okay with changing with their own alterations. Each new hell we press upon the world is one  which we will pay for. We are punished by our sins, not for them. 



The tone changed. The man's face twitched, like he had caught the odor of something wistfully foul in the enveloping black. The whistling was a bit faster now, more of a plaintive groan than a playful twist of wind.  The man had made a realization. His mind had pierced the slow gloam of humanity to find a small point of universality. 'We are all trees' he breathed softly through his pursed lips. Then the meteor struck. The large rock flying through the universe had picked his small backwater planet and found his small backwater field where he stood whistling in the night. It was so massive, he had no chance of escape. By the time the news had reported the scientist's findings, the blast radius covered his entire nation. No vehicle could bear him from the damage now. He and his family would be lost, his home burned beyond even molecular recognition, with a force like an atomic bomb striking so close. He would be lost. But life would not be. The meteor was a predator, a cosmic wolf with gnashing teeth and cracked claws. But prey could be clever. Humans were so good with tools. 



Inside a small black box buried feet under the ground lay a seed. A small seed, a tiny oak rock filled with all of the DNA and potential and history of life on Earth. The box was cracked, and water from the new storm clouds forming over the planet found its way to the cushioning around the seed. It took time. The little life had to crack its way out of its own shell; then the shell of the man, the little black box designed to handle even the force of an atomic bomb. It found its way out. Through the ashey dirt it fled, past the atoms of He and his family and their home and the ashphalt and chaos of humanity. Past humanity it fled, reaching towards light, unsure if the earth above it would bury it. But humans were so good with tools. A sharp metal stab rang out near the plants' new growth. It could feel the earth above it rended, torn from its roots and sent flying into the air. But its roots were strong, buried in humanity. The rending stopped. Above the plant, a small something opened up. It could not tell what it was; had never seen sunlight before. But there was a mass there, a white shining mass of hydrocarbons and polycarbonates. It was a human, come to sample the soil from the strike. 'Hello' said the plant in its own indiscernible language. 'and thank you.'


Later, a mighty oak grew in that spot. The small metal box rose to the surface over the years, and was discovered years after the tree was fully grown. On it, it said; “Humanity does not refer to human beings' selfish nature for self preservation. It refers to the quality within us which protects all life, both ours and others.”",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_zsstd,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/zsstd/please_judge_this_rough_draft_i_would_like_to/,

   “Order up! Twenty-three! Do we have a number twenty-three?”

   A woman walked up to the counter in front of me.  Her stomach pushed tighter against her gray sweatshirt than her breasts, and her hair was matted against her forehead sticky with sweat.  I was looking into eyes that bore the intensity of a hunger not fed for days.

   She reached out her bloated hands.  The double-double with extra crispy fries sat there steaming. 

   *Fuck, I hate this part.*  

   She was about to grab hold of the tray, and I flipped the switch located under the counter.  The contents burst into flame.  Burger, fries, and vanilla milkshake were incinerated.  Little heaps of ashen coal now smoldered in front of her. 

   “*No*!”  She turned away dejected, and began her trek back to the end of the line.

   I turned to my fellow cashier. 

   “Paul.  I’m gonna take a lunch break.  You want to come?”

   “Yeah, okay.  Let me call for some replacements.”

   Paul walked over to the landline affixed to the wall next to the register. 

   “Yeah, could we get two down here?  Just for twenty minutes or so.  Yeah?  Thanks.”

   I walked over to the elevator next to the fridge where the meat is stored.  

   *Ding.*

   “Hey, you’re the two?”  I was looking at the pair of men dressed in civilian attire now coming out of the sliding metal doors.  Neither looked much older than me. 

   “Yeah, we’re it.  Are you Paul?”  The one with the beard and gray flannel shirt had spoken.

   “No.  His co-worker.  Michael.  So, have you guys done this before?”

   “Yeah. More than either of us would like to.”  

   His friend stood without talking, staring vacantly into the packed waiting area.

   *Good.  Teaching some newly departed how to cook and scorch food is not how I want to spend my lunch break.*  “Well then, I guess you know where the uniforms are.  Paul and I’ll be back in a little while.”

   “Sounds good, man.  Take your time, we’ll make sure not to burn the place down.” He said this with a little laugh.  

   I walked away and told Paul our replacements were here.  

   “Good.  So, what’ll it be today?” he said.  “This lovely *In-N-Out*, serving only the freshest in the underworld’s fast-food cuisine?  Or maybe *Burger King*, where you can ‘have it your way,’ so long as your way is charcoaled.”

   “I don’t care.  Let’s just grab something from here and sit outside.”

   We forked two sizzling patties off the stainless steel grill and slapped them on the buns that lay open on our plates.  I followed Paul out of the shop to one of the stark white tables.   We sat underneath its red and yellow umbrella, even there was no need under the gray, sunless sky.  The foot-worn pavement surrounding the establishment had no discernable boundaries.  Countless starving faces that filled the lot stared at us as we took our seats.  

   *What they would give for just one bite.*  I clamped my teeth down around the bun and a collective groan issued from the mass.  The first time I’d heard it I nearly jumped out of my seat.  Now it’s just part of the job.

   I swallowed my first bite.  “Hey, Paul.  Do you ever feel like an asshole?”

   “What?”

   “Just sitting out here, eating.  Some of these people haven’t eaten in weeks.  Others, months or even years.”

   Paul was washing down a handful of salt covered fries with a *Dr. Pepper*.  “I don’t know, man.  Of all the shit they go through?  Us out here eating is just one, very, very small contributor, you know?”

   “I guess.  It’s just the whole situation seems kinda fucked up.  Like, when you died, is this what you expected?”

   “Hell fuckin’—*shit*.  I mean, *hell fuckin’ no*.”  Paul had caught himself speaking too loudly.  Not that whispering makes a difference—we know that He hears everything.  

   I kept my voice down too. “I read *The Divine Comedy* in college, and I thought ‘bull-fuckin’ shit.’  No way any of that ecclesiastical crap could be real.”

   “True…but this isn’t really anything like what Dante described.”

   “I didn’t mean in terms of exact content, man.  Just the idea in general.  The whole ‘circles of hell’ thing? I mean, come on.”  I took another mouthful of my burger.  

   “Yeah, well, times change.  Maybe it *was* like that for him.  Maybe we—we as in, like,  humans—are making improvement.  Now?  Yes, it’s shitty.  No, it’s not as bad as it could be.”

   “As bad as it could be?  No, definitely not.  I agree.  But, God’s sort of a Dick, you know?”  

   I took a look around the third circle.  Restaurant, after restaurant, after restaurant.  *Burger King, McDonalds, Jack In the Box, Applebees, Denny’s, P.F. Chang’s*—the list goes on.  And what surrounds these restaurants?  

   Fat people.  Fat people as far as the eye could see, standing in line to get into the establishment of their choosing.  Fat people of both genders.  Fat people of all races.  The only unifying factor among the customers is their obesity.

   I took a gulp of my vanilla milkshake.  “When I read it—and other stuff about Hell—I thought, ‘something must be wrong.’  God is all-powerful and all-knowing and all-loving, and yet He holds this petty of a fucking grudge?  He has an entire circle of Hell devoted to gluttony?  Seems like a waste of energy if you ask me.” 

   Paul had finished with his fries and was moving on to the burger.  Through a full mouth he said, “Maybe he just needed somewhere for us to go.  Fill in our hours.  How many more do you have left anyway?”

   “2,733.”  We all know our number. 

   “Well see, that’s something.  Over halfway done.  And at least you can eat, right?”

   “I guess.  But I mean, *this* for not going to church on Sundays?  Stuck in fucking Purgatory?  Working here?”

   “Hey, man, I don’t think anyone likes it anymore than you do.  But what’re you gonna do about it?”

   “What can you do?  I see these people shuffle in line for hours upon hours.  They finally get their turn to taste what got them here in the first place.  The meal of their dreams sits there on a platter, the scent dancing around their noses.  They reach down and *poof*.  Up in smoke.  Back to the end of line.  If they’re stuck here, then I guess we are too.”  

   I was almost finished with my burger. “And for what?  Because they had one, two, maybe two hundred too many fucking Happy Meals, they have to wait in line until their bodies have eaten away the excess fat so that they meet Heaven’s standards?  It just seems kind of…sadistic.” 

   Paul was licking the salt and grease from his fingers.  “I hear you.  But like I said, what’s there to do?”

   “Nothing, I guess.  Nothing.”

   I had finished eating.

You see, to you I might be another piece of trash lying at the side of the road, but to me; to me you are everything. 

Think.

Think back to the last time we spoke. Do you remember? I was once like you, a long time ago. I, too, had a job and a family, and friends and a dog that yelped excitedly every night when I came home. Can you see it now? Does my face look familiar?

You don't even stop to look me in the eyes as you drop a penny or two into my outstretched hands. No wonder you don't recognise me. You move on quickly lest I begin to pester you for more change; lest I inquire why a man such as you leaves me only a few pennies when you could obviously spare much more. 

I, too, once wore a suit just like yours. I know how the silk feels against skin, and how the polished leather shoes enhance the illusion. Now my shoes are torn and tattered, dirty and battered. And you know what? That doesn't make me any less of a person.

So why won't you look at me?

Tell me, please.

Why won't you recognise me?

Do you still have the picture we took, the one where we're fishing? You caught so many fish and I caught nothing, only a dirty old boot that you threw back into the water. As an act of kindness you shared yours with me; I had been grateful because we hadn't brought anything else to eat. Life gave you fish, and me it gave a dirty old boot. Unlucky, I guess.

Now the only fishing I do is in old trashcans.

I live with the night, and go where it takes me. Everyday is a new day - a day with a start, middle and end. The days dont flow into each other anymore, that is one thing I am thankful for. You're still stuck in your endless cycles.

Wake up, go to work, come home at night, go to sleep. Repeat. Over and over, day in and day out. 

Now, I don't understand you. How can you stand it, the monotony, the boredom? As children life was exciting and fun. Somehow the innocence mutated, became something else, something so much worse. 

So.

I don't envy you. Can you understand that?

I rage, but I don't envy you at all.

Oh, do I see a spark of recognition in your eyes?

He laughed and cried, the same as you and me. Cody was a human being, and he was just as pissed off about it as anyone else.


He was different too, it's fair to say. When Cody was a baby a brick struck him in the face while playing near a construction site. They were building apartments, and his parents got a wad of money from the construction company as a way of saying sorry. He was permanently blessed with a dent in his head, a line across his forehead that made it look as if he was always pressing his face against a pane of unseen glass. 


My great grandfather had a dent in his head, a small round divot above his left eye. He got it in ``the war'', laying on the ground working on the engine of an American tank. Another soldier was sitting on top of the engine and dropped a big wrench straight in to his mellon. I don't think the military gave him any big wad of money or said sorry, but the event provided him with a fabulous story for the rest of his life. The other soldier, my great grandfather said, was a celebrity who was proudly serving but had no real business as a mechanic. I have no idea who this celebrity was, but my great grandfather lived to be 95 years old, and told this story with a grin until he lost his mind. 


Whether the ding in the head of my proavus really came from a celebrity or not, this was truly a great story. He would tell it to us loudly, waving his hand about, and we would laugh and smile. This story is my fondest memory of him. 


Cody was too young to remember the brick that had smacked him in the head. Even if he had been older, that brick probably would have still excused itself from his memory, politely bowing in to faint obscurity. That brick took his sense of smell, and taste, and left his incredible brain a jumbled mess. Sometimes Cody would be confused, but never angry. That was his blessed gift, to never be angry, and it served him well.


We all cherish the stories of our scars, they are the physical record of our triumphs over death. At any good party someone will show off their old battle wounds, even if they were just the result of an errant golf ball. My great grandfather happily told the story of how the famous actor introduced himself with a wrench. Cody loved to spin his tale, even though he couldn't actually remember it. In his rendition the brick struck him at high noon, in a blistering summer heat, and his dear mother had to run 50 city blocks to the hospital while carrying the baby and the brick. The brick didn't stay lodged in his head after impact, Cody told us, but his mother brought it along anyway, ``just in case!''  Everyone laughed at that point in the story.


And then Cody would remind us how lucky he was to survive that brick, and how good his life was as a result. You didn't feel sorry for Cody and his dented forehead. He was intelligent and funny, and just a little confused sometimes. People called him stupid, but he wasn't.

I met a peculiar man today. A man, a tall man, broad shoulders, thick hair, a man much like the rest. A crooked smile here, a calloused hand there, just like any other man. But this man seemed particularly peculiar in my mind.
 
Maybe it was because he decided to talk to me.
 
I was sitting on my bench, as I always do when I can get around to it. Pigeons pecked around my feet as breadcrumbs fell from my fingertips. It was routine, hell, it was practically ritual, that I come down here, drop bread crumbs for the birds, and stare off into the dark green and  brown made up by the cool grass and the tall trees. I have done it for quite some time now. Some days it's harder to make it down to my bench than others. But it's really all that I have, my bench, the birds, the trees, the moments there in time.
 
And it was on this day, just like any other day when I am at my bench, that this man walked past. He walked past so swiftly, head down, direct, like most that walk past me. But after he had made it a few steps past me and my bench, he stopped, and spun on his heel, like someone was using him as a top, a child perhaps. He was tall, at least six feet, with a dark grey hat that made him seem even taller. He matched it with a grey suit, and carried a newspaper under his arm. He smiled at me, in a way so vulnerable that this man no longer seemed so large. I smiled back, wondering why the man had stopped so suddenly. He finally opened his mouth, with his hat in his hands; ""Excuse me, Ma'am, but would you happen to have the time?""
 
It took me a moment to react before I found the words to answer him, as he stood smiling sheepishly, like a boy who had forgotten his school assignment. ""Oh yes,"" I answered, ""let me check my watch."" I reached into my bag and pulled out of all the clutter a pocket watch, the one I always carry. I opened it, and saw what I easily knew was an incorrect time. I held it up to my ear, and heard not a sound from inside the watch, nothing echoing between its many gears. ""Oh lord, this thing never works, I'm afraid it's not kept the time sir, I'm sorry.""
 
""Oh it's alright Ma'am, thank you for looking,"" he said with a smile. ""I must say, it is a fine looking pocket watch Ma'am, reminds me of one that belongs to my father.""
 
""Well I'm sure his probably kept time, unlike this junk I've been carrying around,"" I say as I chuckle to myself.
 
The man chuckles a bit too. ""May I ask then why you keep it on your person, Ma'am? Seems like a broken watch serves no good to anyone, especially not to a nice lady such as yourself.""
 
I look at the man and smile. ""It's my husband’s actually, and I don't think he'd take kindly to me getting rid of his favorite watch!"" Both me and the man laughed aloud, and I motion for him to sit on the bench with me, and he obliges. He put his hand forth, and shakes my outstretched hand. ""I'm Howard,"" he says with a grin; ""I'm Alice,"" I replied.
 
""Well I am pleased to meet you Alice."" I handed him a chunk of bread, and we silently fed the curious pigeons their meals, us both content to just sit and enjoy the company of each other and the birds for a bit. I looked over at this strange man who had decided to sit with me, an old lady who feeds the birds. Not a very glamorous way to spend the afternoon for a man such as this at his age. ""Were you going anywhere important just now?"" I inquired.
 
I seemed to rouse him from deep thought. ""Hmm? Oh no, not very. Just some errands to run is all, but I can't seem to get the wherewithal to concentrate on them,"" he replied and his head turned back down towards the birds, a certain light gone from the once innocent looking man. ""Is there something on your mind young man?"" I pressed.
 
He exhales deeply, his eyes focused on his feet. ""If I’m being honest, I'm gonna be called off for the war soon,"" he answered. ""I just got the notice this morning. Making sure to pick up milk on my way home for the wife seems a little more insignificant with that perspective."" He leaned back against the bench, brought a hand to his perspiring head. He sees me looking at him through his hand, and tries to compose himself; ""Not that I'm scared or nothing!"" he stated with a bravado that only rung half-true. ""Just a bit nervous is all.""
 
""That's nothing to be ashamed of young man. War is a place filled with frightful things. Why, my husband was not much different from you when he was called to fight. He was nervous as all heck, but he knew it was the right thing to do, so he fought."" I look down at my cool, calloused hands in the morning light. ""He seems like a good man,"" the young man replies with a small smile.
 
A smile breaks across my face, one I cannot hold back as I think about days long forgotten, and I even let out a laugh remembering back on our time together. ""He was a good man,"" I replied. The smile starts to fade as I look up towards the sky, and then back down at my hands. ""Oh god, how I loved that man,” I said in a soft whisper.
 
Howard put a comforting hand on my shoulder, and it was warm and I felt safe like I haven't felt in so very long. ""If you don't mind me asking,"" the man asked quietly, ""is your husband passed? Did he die in the war?""
 
I can't bear to look up at the moment, only staring down at the bench and the newspaper the man had put down from under his arm. ""No, he came back from the war. But,"" I had trouble getting the words out, ""my husband did not come back the same. He was plagued by nightmares, terrors of the horrible things he had seen while fighting. It drove him to drink, it drove him mad, and it drove him to forget about…"" I start to stammer as my fingers run over a dark scar hidden under my sleeve. ""He forgot about how we used to be. The combination of it all proved too much for both him and me. My husband is now passed away, to answer your question."" And the true answer, I screamed in my head, is yes! Yes, yes, my husband died in that awful war, for the man who came back was not my husband, only an empty shell of a man for which there was only room for sadness and sorrow. My husband went to war, and never returned.
 
The man next to me, Howard, sat silent for a bit. I could tell that he didn't know how to respond, but whether it was because he didn't know how to react to such a story, or if he feared that a similar fate would befall him and his situation, I did not know. After what seemed like over a minute, the man spoke up. ""I'm sorry to hear what happened to your husband, ma'am.""
 
""Thank you, it means quite a lot,"" I said, as I looked up at Howard and saw what seemed to be a familiar kindness in his eyes, something I haven't been privileged to in years. I grab a hold of the hand he was resting on the bench. I fight back tears as I arrange the words I want to say. ""You have no need to worry though Howard. You will make it through that war, I know it. You will make it home to see your family."" 
 
""I appreciate you saying that, Alice"" he replied, his voice softer than before. He checked his wrist for the watch that wasn't there, and we both laughed, breaking some of the tension. Howard stood up, and donned the grey hat he had taken off. ""Well, I better get going; I still have to pick up that milk before heading home."" He stood there awkwardly, as we didn't know what to say. ""Thanks for the talk Alice; it means a lot, even to a guy like me."" He cracked that crooked smile of his. I smiled back at him, ""Your welcome, Howard, I'm glad I could help.""
 
He smiled again, nodded, and turned to walk away. He walked maybe a total of seven steps until I called out ""Howard!"" He spun around again, in top-like fashion. ""What is it, Alice?""
 
I had trouble getting the words out. ""Please, come home this time."" He looked down for a moment, and then looked back up, his eyes showing a pain that hadn't been there, even moments before.
 
""I will, Alice. I will.""
 
And off he walked, into forever, as a dropped newspaper with a long past, but never forgotten date blew past my bench, and became nothingness.

1333773755.0,5,self.shortstories,rxgfh,One Gold Star,,11,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/rxgfh/one_gold_star/,"*This is a very short story that was inspired by a professor of mine. It is a very fictionalized account of what happened. More like a fantasy of mine that I wish was true. Enjoy.*

 “Good job, Katy! One gold star for you. You can use it to get something in the Learning and Motivation store.”

Dr. Biff Skinner, my psychology professor. He’s pretty funny and makes the class experience enjoyable, even when the material is boring and dry. He’s one of my favorite professors, but he’s the only one that I want to fuck. And I have a plan.

I went to his office later that day. His door was open and he was on his computer. I stood and watched him for a few seconds before I knocked. He looked up, smiled, and welcomed me in. I walked in and shut the door behind me. He looked a little surprised that the door was shut, but didn’t say anything about it.

“What can I do for you, Katy?” Dr. Skinner said.

“I’d like to redeem my gold star, Dr. Skinner.” I said with a grin.

“Let me guess, you want an ‘A’ on your next exam?” he replied jokingly.

With as much courage as I could muster, I replied, “No. What I want is for you to bend me over your desk and fuck me from behind.”

He seemed a bit startled, but quickly recovered and said with a devious smile on his face, “Well now, you’ll need more than one gold star in order to get that.”

“And just what would I have to do to earn enough gold stars?”

He stood up from behind his desk, looked me in the eyes, and unzipped his pants. “This would be a start.”

I walked over to him, got down on my knees, and took his cock out of his pants. I started licking up, down, and all around his cock and balls, allowing the tip to go in my mouth every few licks. When his cock was covered in my saliva, I slid him all the way into my mouth, letting my tongue play with the underside of his cock as he was thrusting in and out. My hands went to his balls, massaging them and rubbing his taint while he was thrusting and moaning. His hands were bunched in my hair, guiding his cock into my mouth. He was moaning that he was cumming, so I sucked harder. He shot his load into my mouth and it slid down my throat. I swallowed it all, stood up, wiped my mouth, and asked him with a wink, “Did that earn me enough gold stars?”

“Oh God, did it ever!” He replied breathlessly. 

He pushed me over his desk, pulling my shirt off in the process. I wasn’t wearing a bra, so I was naked from the waist up. He pulled my panties down in one fell swoop, pushed my skirt up, and thrust into me hard. I moaned so loud I was sure someone would hear me. He thrust into me harder, holding my waist to keep me steady. It only took five more thrusts and I was gone. I came so hard that I shivered. He came again seconds later. I lay breathing hard on his desk for a few seconds, trying to catch my breath. When I got up, he looked at me and whispered with a smile on his face, “Good job. One gold star.” 

I put my shirt back on, pulled my skirt down, leaving my panties on the floor of his office as a little remembrance for him. I winked at him, opened his office door, and walked out with his cum running down my legs. As I passed the student aid, she openly stared at me, so I knew that she had heard at least part of what happened in there. I put my finger up to my mouth to tell her to keep quiet and walked out of the building. I can’t wait to earn some more gold stars.

My sister and I are racing outside now, our bare and naked feet fly across the hardwood floor and onto our tired deck. My prescient mother, resting in a green plastic chair, is already waiting for the two of us to dart into the nightly confines of our very Philadelphian backyard. She’s looking at the pair of us, her smile the starting pistol to an evening of adventure.

I’m grabbing a glass jar and tossing one to my younger sister now. Her and I now dash down the few steps of our porch and step onto our playing field. I can see them all, now. The lightning bugs. They dot our lawn like incandescent snowflakes, occasionally lifting off to find a new temporary resting place. I can almost hear the beat of a thousand tiny wings right now. There must be hundreds here. They paint our yard now, never satisfied with their place on the canvas.

But this wonder is nothing new to my sister and I. We have done this as far as my memory will stretch. We’re dashing off in different directions now, as to cover the most ground. There isn’t a second to waste, not a moment to spare—I’m not sure how much longer the fireflies will glow for us. Now that I’m over by the big tree at the edge of the lawn, I can begin my work.

A particularly gleaming bug is drifting past my eyes right now. I’m going to turn my jar to the side, very carefully now, and… *got him*. Quickly I’m screwing the lid back on my jar. I eye my twinkling prize. It’s crawling on the side of my jar now, exploring his new home, I’m sure. I can’t think of a name for him quite yet, but there will be time for formalities later. Right now I need to continue the hunt.

Bending down now I scoop up a bug at my feet. I’m feeling the minuscule legs of the thing tickle my palm now. I’m assessing my catch. This one is too small. It simply will not do. It needs to grow and mature before I could even consider capturing this luminous soul. I’m going to let it go. I open my palm and it flits away from me, surely rejoining his glowing brethren but this time with a story to tell.

My baby sister and I are darting across our lawn, back and forth now, for what has seemed like only a few moments. We’re laughing, enthralled in the beauty and wonderment of the scene.

“Hey, Dea, I found a really big one right here!” I’m exclaiming to my sister now.

“Fabio, Fabio, I see a really bright one! Come here!” She’s yelling back.

It hasn’t been long but our game is over now. We’re saying good night to the fireflies now and sprinting back up to our wood deck, exhausted from the chase but running on an adrenaline high. I briefly and proudly show my mom the night’s catch and before she can say ‘Oh, wow,’ I’ve already begun staring at my jar, full of little lightning bugs. It’s glowing bright, my suburban lantern.

My usual request to bring the jar inside has been denied again, per usual. Now it’s time for me to make this glass jar for my lightning bugs a home. I’m poking tiny holes in the top of the jar using a pen now so they can breath. I’m going to place some grass in too so they have food. What a nice home I’ve made for Steven, Ross, Fireman, Lightdude, Ember, Doug, Nick, and Eric. *I’m going to say good night to you now, little guys. I’ll see you in the morning!*

Morning is here now and I’m running outside to check on my prized jar. Only one of my fireflies is alive now. He’s slowly crawling across the bottom of the glass, navigating through the bodies of his mothers, brothers, sisters, aunts. His belly is smoldering ever so dimly now, barely casting a light in this hot morning sun. I don’t think they liked the grass I gave them, either.

“Mom, why do my bugs always die in the morning? I even gave them grass this time.” I’m asking my poor mother now.

“Because…” She begins. “Because their light only burns for a night. They burn bright and hot, some more bright than others. Their bellies are big and glow at night but it will only last for so long. In the morning their lightbulb burns out and they die. Their lightbulb burns out, that’s all.”

Shaking my now lifeless and lightless jar out into the yard now, I’m wondering how bright my lightbulb will burn.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_pqere,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/pqere/bottling_up_lightning/,

trashy and it turned me on. It also wasn’t the way he would never take off     
his long, black socks; he was afraid that his feet smelled. I found all of his     
irritating habits to be endearing after I have my coffee. It couldn’t have

	    Maybe it was the way he would make love to me. Pushing     
himself against me and pounding away like a jackhammer, rolling     
over and falling asleep. I would run my aching hands between his     
soft chest hair and wonder what stars taste like in my mouth. I loved all of it.    

	    I remember the hours lost underneath the sheets, sunlight     
dancing between our pirouetted fingers. The texture of his redone     
tattoos against my exploring hands. Our tiny nightstand we stole    
 from a dumpster at 3am. He sanded it down with utmost precision     
and detail and I wildly sprayed it black and the drawer red (now the     
red will have flecked off). Or the smell of coffee I had every morning     
to wake up to. So strong.    

	I know what it is. The moment that shattered us. That scattered     
our lengthy dreams and quiet hopes. I came home and shook off the    
 rain from my black umbrella. I shucked off my shoes and ran to get     
out of my dripping clothes. I noticed it. No, it wasn’t his cock in someone     
else’s body. It wasn’t even another lover. It was just his green, matted,     
wet towel lying on top of our bed.     ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_n8wpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/n8wpd/it_was/,

DAMSEL IN DISTRESS
 
The bullets whizzed past. People were getting gunned. Debris was clouding everything. The storm of blood, sand and stone resonated in the eyes of everyone leaving pulses of fear in their hearts. They were scarred for life.
 
The militants of the regime kept the civilians pegged down in their base. It was a bottleneck situation. Only one-way out, and it was through the street full of barriers and resistant front lines of merciless soldiers of Bashar's regime. They had snipers placed in strategic wide-angle access points, making sure no one could even lay a foot on the street.
 
The people were pushed back either into their houses or whatever cover they could find from the constant blasts and bullets.
 
Bodies lay in piles down the street and the smell of blood and gun powder staunched the air. One was forced to only two sounds, either screams or bomb blasts. Silence was a forgotten term.
 
Hisham was one of the gunmen. Thirty four killed today, he thought. It wasn't enough. Abbas, one of the other militants, was on forty seven. He just had to beat him. HE HAD TOO !!!
 
He remained behind cover while reloading his rifle. The anxiety was building up in him. Once cocked and loaded he got up and sprayed all the bullets. He just wanted to see them run, to see them cry, to see them afraid.
 
He smiled at his collage of mass murder. No one could touch him. Here he was god.
 
He slumped his rifle over his shoulder and admired his work. They were too afraid to come.
 
Suddenly, he noticed one of the bodies moving among the dead. It was a woman, half conscious she moved weakly. Trying to regain a sense of where she was, but she was defeated by several injuries, lack of energy and mental torture of the battlefield.
 
'Desert,' thought Hisham. The flame inside him ignited.
 
He motioned to his colleagues on his side to cover him. Walking the past barrier, he went to her and grabbed her by the forelock and dragged her back towards the base.
 
Ignoring the shouting, screaming, kicking and crying from the woman as her body scraped against the rubble and ground, he just had one thing in his mind. Tonight he was having a feast!
 
THE DEVIL'S CELLAR
 
The woman was chained in a dark cellar. It smelled of old dust and musty oil. The bars and walls were covered with cobwebs, and the whole place was cluttered with broken furniture and outdated newspapers. There was a small window behind her where the moonlight trickled in, shining against her bare body.
 
Each hand was tied by rusty chains supported by a post on both sides. She was forced to either stand upright or slump and let the pressure of her body tense the chain around her wrists.
 
She felt a mouse brush her leg and let a scream in fear while jolting. Immediately, the bruises on her body ached even more from the sudden movement. Her tears and sobs dried up. She could do nothing. She was nothing. She was completely helpless.
 
Why didn't they just kill her?
 
She was struck by horror. What they were going to do to her?
 
Suddenly, she hears a scraping rattle against the bars with footsteps. The pace was brisk, haunting, like a panther in hiding waiting to pounce.
 
She could hear the person walking up to her. The moonlight only revealed the boots and military trousers. The upper half was veiled by the lusting darkness. Even so, she could see some smoke. The trail led to cigarette, which was revealed as he lowered his hand and flicked it away. Hisham stared at her. The fear in her eyes was unmistakable. Sweat pouring from her forehead, her body trembling from fear and her breath racing. Here she was, naked, stripped of dignity and humiliated. He loved the power he had. He was in control, and she was her prey.
 
'This bitch is mine,' he thought.
 
In a sudden move, he slapped her on the face, leaving a red mark, went behind her pulling her backwards by her hair. He put his hand over her mouth, unzipped his pants and thrust into her.
 
Her scream muffled against the cold, hard fingers, her eyes widened and tears started streaming down her face as she felt him inside her. He handled her fiercely and with each pound, she screamed.
 
“PLEASE STOP!”
 
“NO”
 
“PLEASE!!!""
 
She knew there was no one who could save her. He pushed harder with every force against her with increasing pain. Her legs were trembling. Her body was shaking. With one long last thrust, he pushed away from himself. She slumped helplessly as she cried and moaning. She was defeated.
Wiping the sweat of his forehead, he zipped his pants and made his way out. The echoes of the her cries decayed as he walked away.
 
He met three of his men down the corridor.
 
“The bitch is all yours,"" he said.
 
By the time he reached the end of the long corridor, he could hear the screams all over again. The boys were doing a good job.
 
THE BIRTH OF HOPE
 
Nearly five months passed. The woman repeatedly abused, manhandled and tortured. She was reduced to nothing but an object, a sex object. Even slaves were privileged to have feelings, but hers were dead.
 
The same prison, the same four walls, the same sins every day. Her life was lifeless. Her body lost its stature. There was one significant change. She was pregnant.
 
So many of the militants had their way with her. She didn't know which one fathered the bastard child she was carrying. She could only feel the baby move in her. She didn't care whose it was, it was a life inside of her. It was her baby.
 
Hisham was in the mood again. He strode towards her cell, the urge burning in inside him. There was nothing left in her that attracted him to her except the fear she had in her eyes. However, it eventually died out. She learnt to accept that this was her fate.
 
There was no fun anymore. He wanted to change that this time.
 
He walked up to her near-limp body. Her eyes were blank, expressionless.
 
He grabbed her face, locked into her eyes with a menacing smile. She just looked at him, There was nothing she could feel anymore. He placed his hand on her swollen belly and for a second he saw the jump in her eyes.
 
'The bitch cared for this kid,' he thought. This was going to be fun.
 
He drew a blade from his side pocket, which gleamed in the rays of sunlight. Her eyes widened. What was he going to do?
 
And without thinking he pressed the knife on top of her belly, under her bosom. She immediately realized the horror she was about to face. Slowly, and yet delicately, he started slicing around the belly.
 
Scream after scream, the pain worsened. The blood trickled down her legs. She tried swerving side to side but the more she moved it hurt and ripped her harder. There was nothing, but she could but watch herself being cut open. Tears were streaming down her eyes.
 
“STOP … PLEASE STOP … NO!”
 
Her screams couldn't help her. He kept cutting her open.
 
He was halfway around and then stopped. Her belly was half skinned open, the bloodied internals could be seen from the side. He threw the blade away.
 
 
She couldn't feel relieved but at least he stopped. The pain was unbearable until he grabbed the open side of her stomach and swung it to the other side to rip her entire skin off. She screamed so loudly, helplessly as she felt pain like never before.
 
Everything was now revealed. Blood was splattered around her feet. She was shaking uncontrollably. She just wanted it to end. He threw the separated flabby stomach skin to side as if it were junk.
 
'Now comes the fun part,' he thought.
 
He could see the foetus wedged inside her. Ferociously, he grabbed it by the neck and pulled it away from its clove. A few organs slipped and slid to the floor.
She screamed. Her baby was in his hands.
 
“Please don't harm it, please don't harm it. It didn't do anything to you. Take me but leave it alone,"" she cried. Her voice was nearly gone.
 
She was losing too much blood. Her vision started to blur.
 
He looked at the disgusting flesh in his hand. It was weak and pathetic, covered with blood. He grabbed the umbilical cord and ripped it open, separating the thing from the woman. She screamed as the cord hung loosely over her revealed stomach, dripping pus and blood on the floor.
 
He then held the thing in front of her. He let her stare at the unborn baby for a split second before splitting its neck. The baby was dead.
 
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"" she screamed.
 
He swung the flesh over his head and pulled out a pistol and shoved it into her mouth. In that one moment, he saw the ultimate fear in her eyes. Covered in tears and blood, she slumped in his mercy. He looked at her long enough to enjoy the product of his work before he pulled the trigger.
 
The bullet went through head and blood splattered against the wall behind her. Her body was completely limp as the chains in her hand tensed under her dead weight.
 
Her intestines scrambled to the floor.
 
She was dead.
 
REFLECTION POINT
 
I would first like to apologise if the story disgusted/offended you. But I had to make sure that what I wrote really affected the reader. We have become such a cold-hearted society that we have become apathetic to mass murder. We are witnessing an act of national terrorism, yet it is amazing that we can sit back and watch it happen without doing anything.
 
If you felt anything from this story, be it sadness, pain, hurt, disgust, anger, then please use that to help me raise money for the Syrian people. Don't just sit there and think others are doing something or it won't make any difference. This is the wrong mentality!

No, there was no flash. Only nothingness. It was like someone turned the light off. Nothingness... You would be surprised how familiar you are with it. But, it didn't last long. No. The all so safe nothingness was interrupted by the fiery mushroom cloud in the distance.

I looked up towards the cloud of fire. Watching it as it slowly filled the black canvas. I saw hundreds, thousands of sunflowers staring at me. Despising me... They stared at me, like I was to blame for this. Like I was the one who made it grow. I looked back at them, leaning up against the tree. I sighed, and looked at the mushroom with a smile.

1375745407.0,4,self.shortstories,1jrwco,"My favorite short story: Some Of Us Have Been Threatening Our Friend Colby, by Donald Barthelme",hoopyfrood1,5,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jrwco/my_favorite_short_story_some_of_us_have_been/,"Some of us had been threatening our friend Colby for a long time, because of the way he had been behaving. And now he'd gone too far, so we decided to hang him. Colby argued that just because he had gone too far (he did not deny that he had gone too far) did not mean that he should be subjected to hanging. Going too far, he said, was something everybody did sometimes. We didn't pay much attention to this argument. We asked him what sort of music he would like played at the hanging. He said he'd think about it but it would take him a while to decide. I pointed out that we'd have to know soon, because Howard, who is a conductor, would have to hire and rehearse the musicians and he couldn't begin until he knew what the music was going to be. Colby said he'd always been fond of Ives's Fourth Symphony. Howard said that this was a ""delaying tactic"" and that everybody knew that the Ives was almost impossible to perform and would involve weeks of rehearsal, and that the size of the orchestra and chorus would put us way over the music budget. ""Be reasonable,"" he said to Colby. Colby said he'd try to think of something a little less exacting. 

Hugh was worried about the wording of the invitations. What if one of them fell into the hands of the authorities? Hanging Colby was doubtless against the law, and if the authorities learned in advance what the plan was they would very likely come in and try to mess everything up. I said that although hanging Colby was almost certainly against the law, we had a perfect moral right to do so because he was our friend, belonged to us in various important senses, and he had after all gone too far. We agreed that the invitations would be worded in such a way that the person invited could not know for sure what he was being invited to. We decided to refer to the event as ""An Event Involving Mr. Colby Williams."" A handsome script was selected from a catalogue and we picked a cream-colored paper. Magnus said he'd see to having the invitations printed, and wondered whether we should serve drinks. Colby said he thought drinks would be nice but was worried about the expense. We told him kindly that the expense didn't matter, that we were after all his dear friends and if a group of his dear friends couldn't get together and do the thing with a little bit of eclat, why, what was the world coming to? Colbv asked if he would be able to have drinks, too, before the event. We said,""Certainly."" 

The next item of business was the gibbet. None of us knew too much about gibbet design, but Tomas, who is an architect, said he'd look it up in old books and draw the plans. The important thing, as far as he recollected, was that the trapdoor function perfectly. He said that just roughly, counting labor and materials, it shouldn't run us more than four hundred dollars. ""Good God !"" Howard said. He said what was Tomas figuring on, rosewood? No, just a good grade of pine, Tomas said. Victor asked if unpainted pine wouldn't look kind of ""raw,"" and Tomas replied that he thought it could be stained a dark walnut without too much trouble. 

I said that although I thought the whole thing ought to be done really well and all, I also thought four hundred dollars for a gibbet, on top of the expense for the drinks, invitations, musicians, and everything, was a bit steep, and why didn't we just use a tree -- a nice-looking oak, or something? I pointed out that since it was going to be a June hanging the trees would be in glorious leaf and that not only would a tree add a kind of ""natural"" feeling but it was also strictly traditional, especially in the West. Tomas, who had been sketching gibbets on the backs of envelopes, reminded us that an outdoor hanging always had to contend with the threat of rain. Victor said he liked the idea of doing it outdoors, possibly on the bank of a river but noted that we would have to hold it some distance from the city, which presented the problem of getting the guests, musicians, etc., to the site and then back to town. 

At this point everybody looked at Harry, who runs a car-and-truck-rental business. Harry said he thought he could round up enough limousines to take care of that end but that the drivers would have to be paid. The drivers, he pointed out, wouldn't be friends of Colby's and couldn't be expected to donate their services, any more than the bartender or the musicians. He said that he had about ten limousines, which he used mostly for funerals, and that he could probably obtain another dozen by calling around to friends of his in the trade. He said also that if we did it outside, in the open air, we'd better figure on a tent or awning of some kind to cover at least the principals and the orchestra, because if the hanging was being rained on he thought it would look kind of dismal. As between gibbet and tree, he said, he had no particular preferences and he really thought that the choice ought to be left up to Colby, since it was his hanging. Colby said that everybody went too far, sometimes, and weren't we being a little Draconian? Howard said rather sharply that all that had already been discussed, and which did he want, gibbet or tree? Colby asked if he could have a firing squad. No, Howard said, he could not. Howard said a firing squad would just be an ego trip for Colby, the blindfold and last-cigarette bit, and that Colby was in enough hot water already without trying to ""upstage"" everyone with unnecessary theatrics. Colby said he was sorry, he hadn't meant it that way, he'd take the tree. Tomas crumpled up the gibbet sketches he'd been making, in disgust. 

Then the question of the hangman came up. Pete said did we really need a hangman? Because if we used a tree, the noose could be adjusted to the appropriate level and Colby could just jump off something -- a chair or stool or something. Besides, Pete said, he very much doubted if there were any free-lance hangmen wandering around the country, now that capital punishment has been done away with absolutely, temporarily, and that we'd probably have to fly one in from England or Spain or one of the South American countries, and even if we did that how could we know in advance that the man was a professional, a real hangman, and not just some money-hungry amateur who might bungle the job and shame us all, in front of every body? We all agreed then that Colby should just jump off something and that a chair was not what he should jump off of, because that would look, we felt, extremely tacky -- some old kitchen chair sitting out there under our beautiful tree. Tomas, who is quite modern in outlook and not afraid of innovation, proposed that Colby be standing on a large round rubber ball ten feet in diameter. This, he said, would afford a sufficient ""drop"" and would also roll out of the way if Colby suddenly changed his mind after jumping off. He reminded us that by not using a regular hangman we were placing an awful lot of the responsibility for the success of the affair on Colby himself, and that although he was sure Colby would perform creditably and not disgrace his friends at the last minute, still, men have been known to get a little irresolute at times like that, and the ten-foot-round rubber ball, which could probably be fabricated rather cheaply, would insure a ""bang-up"" pro duction right down to the wire. 

At the mention of ""wire,"" Hank, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke up and said he wondered if it wouldn't be better if we used wire instead of rope -- more efficient and in the end kinder to Colby, he suggested. Colby began looking a little green, and I didn't blame him, because there is something extremely distasteful in think ing about being hanged with wire instead of rope -- it gives you sort of a revulsion, when you think about it. I thought it was really quite unpleasant of Hank to be sitting there talking about wire, just when we had solved the problem of what Colby was going to jump off of so neatly, with Tomas's idea about the rubber ball, so I hastily said that wire was out of the question, because it would injure the tree -- cut into the branch it was tied to when Colby's full weight hit it -- and that in these days of increased respect for the environment, we didn't want that, did we? Colby gave me a grateful look, and the meeting broke up.

Everything went off very smoothly on the day of the event (the music Colby finally picked was standard stuff, Elgar, and it was played very well by Howard and his boys). It didn't rain, the event was well attended, and we didn't run out of Scotch, or anything. The ten-foot rubber ball had been painted a deep green and blended in well with the bucolic setting. The two things I remember best about the whole episode are the grateful look Colby gave me when I said what I said about the wire, and the fact that nobody has ever gone too far again.

So rough that they smoothed out and wore down everything they touched, like fine grain paper that carpenters use to reveal hidden beauty. But his hands never brought out anything quite so beautiful. They only brought out the worst in people, the side that begs and fiends until 3 a.m., the side the neighbors complain about.

His hands touched things that ought not slide down throats, but often did. These hands saw all the faces and touched all the things, but never really said a word. When they did say things- the things were usually misspelled and messy, like a child who never learned much more than the alphabet. They scribbled small things at night while they tried to finish enough schoolwork to escape a small twisted piece of land.

His hands once did semi-great and mundane things. The hands used to touch hot circular metal with long handles attached to them so that the operator wouldn't get burned. They used to perform in front of people completely captivated by the sounds they unleashed form a slightly raised platform at the back of a dark room. His hands would labor on hot days for companies that abused them and had them handle things only men did.

His hands did what only scared men could do. His hands pushed against an invisible assailant in the middle of the night until the next day would peak over the horizon and beg every young soul to finally rest. But hands don't need rest. Hands need a will behind them to move; to push and take as they pleased.

his hands held precious things, but never for long. The hands weren't very skilled at juggling. they would drop these precious things one by one until only one object was left in each hand.

The left hand constantly held a crystalline nightmare that unlocked a secret playground within the minds of every insomniac with twenty dollars.

The right hand frequently clenched a green bottle. The right hand loved this bottle although it led the hands to forget what they were doing, or what they had done.

His hands once held a precious thing. Night after night when the juggling would begin, his hands were on a waist. They ran their rough nerves through silky hair, over pursed lips, and down an alert shoulder.

His hands once held a precious thing. But precious things break, when they are dropped, down, where precious things rot.

These hands shook many others, but only let go of one.

Countless bodies, some with missing limbs, lay broken in the surf. The swordsman lay on the rust-red sand, his left arm trapped underneath the battered torso of an enemy archer. He had tried to stand, but his legs didn't seem to work. His blade, eighteen inches of lethally sharp, carefully-detailed steel, was half-buried in the ground. 

Night fell. As the sun dipped below the waves, its glow illuminated a solitary figure staggering down the beach. The black-armored man stepped over mutilated corpses, kicking aside a half-shattered helmet. The swordsman grunted in pain as he raised his head, in an attempt to identify the shadowy fighter. Suddenly, his mind flashed with recognition. The bloodied, scarred man standing before him was none other than the one he had trusted with his darkest secrets, with his most desperate plans and the terrible details of his horrific past. It was his Lieutenant. 

""So, it was you."" The swordsman spit blood onto the sand. ""It was you who let the enemy know. You let my men, your men, the soldiers who trusted you to lead them, die at the hands of their worst foes."" The Lieutenant said nothing. With a burst of lightning quickness, the swordsman pulled his weapon from the sand. Rivulets of blood ran down the side of the blade. He stifled a scream of pain as he pushed himself up on his elbow, and then rolled to his feet. Painful as it was, the swordsman took a fighting stance. A look of amused surprise slowly appeared on the Lieutenant's face. He reached behind his back and drew a bone-white sword, its smoothly-finished metal hilt glinting in the dying sunlight. ""Don't fight me, my General,"" the Lieutenant said. ""It cannot end well for you. Stand down, and I'll make this quick."" The swordsman responded with a single, sad shake of his head. Then he charged.

The swordsman's blade came down in a silver arc, spattering blood across the already-saturated ground. The Lieutenant, taken aback at his former commander's spurt of energy, was forced to parry. He whipped his blade around at the swordsman's head, only to find that the old man was no longer where he expected. The swordsman had ducked under the slash, bringing the tip of his sword up into his opponent's armpit. The Lieutenant screamed in rage, his armor penetrated. His foot swung furiously back, catching the swordsman by the ankle. The swordsman fell, exhaling thunderously as he hit the beach. The Lieutenant's blade was a white blur as it swung down at its master's old friend and confidant, but it was rebuffed by the swordsman's leather vambrace. The swordsman rolled to the right, sprung to his feet, and delivered a vicious kick to the side of his subordinate's head. As the swordsman landed, he pummeled the Lieutenant's sword hand with the hilt of his blade. The Lieutenant cried out, his hand shattered. His blade, once as white as ivory, was bloodied by the sand upon which it landed. The swordsman brought his blade down in a savage curve, severing the Lieutenant's head. The body of the swordsman's foe hit the surf, splashing bloody water onto the victorious General. 

The swordsman, his energy spent, laboriously opened the fingers of his right hand, allowing his blade to fall. He sank to his knees, a slow stream of blood staining his cheek. He sighed, and his body twisted around as he landed on his back. He let out one last groan as he looked up at the silver circle of the moon, the seawater lapping up past his ancient greaves. And as the breath left his body, the swordsman realized that he had reached his equilibrium.

Andy could tell you about all the constellations and all of the Caesars and when they ruled. Andy could explain complex issues and make them seem simple. Andy could pretty much do anything except stop using heroin. 

Andy’s co-workers, of which I am one, all know that Andy does heroin. Some of them talk about it. To some its funny, and to others its sad; no one says anything to Andy directly about it though. So when Andy falls asleep at his desk we go along with his excuse that he stayed up late last night because there was a west coast game on that went into extra innings; and ,man, is he tired. Oh Andy, Andy has a million excuses but never a dollar the day after payday.

While his co-workers, of which I am one, are doing things like paying rent and mortgages and buying food, Andy is buying heroin and paying back anyone who lent him money the week before and is lucky enough to track him down. Oh Andy, is heroin really that good? Something about you rouses a demon that sleeps deep inside of me.

Oh Andy, so smart; he has everything in the world going for him. If it wasn't for that damn heroin he’d be an executive somewhere, or maybe a high-priced lawyer; he’d probably be a professor at some fancy east coast prep school where the girls wear knee-length skirts and everyone’s jacket has a crest on it. Oh Andy, I wonder if you ever regret trying heroin. I'm sure sometimes you do, but more often than not, you’re too busy trying to find heroin or trying to use it.

Andy is such a nice guy. Andy is killing himself. We’re watching, his family is watching, his dealer is watching; everybody's watching Andy kill himself. We watch without understanding. I wonder if Andy watches us and wonders why no one cares enough to help him. Not that he would accept the help, but it would be nice if someone offered it. But hey, there's only so much time in a day, and we've all got our own lives to manage. So Andy manages his heroin habit alone.

Andy lives with his mother. She looks at Andy but does not see him. Andy’s mother thinks that a daily heroin habit, one that's been going on for ten years, is something that Andy will just drop one day. She thinks that Andy will come to his senses and just quit. 

They fight over the missing money sometimes. Andy doesn't want to, but sometimes he’ll have to steal twenty or a hundred dollars from his mom. Andy’s habit is a greedy monster. He always intends to pay back every dime but something always comes up; usually its the next opportunity to get high. Oh Andy, it seems like the world itself is sighing as you kill yourself. If only there was a way.

Sometimes Andy will miss a few weeks of work. These are the times when Andy goes to detox. In detox they give Andy things like Suboxone and Methadone to replace the heroin that his body is used to. But they aren't quite the same. Andy likes the ritual. The needle and the spoon; finding a vein. Andy likes the tightness of the cord when he ties himself off. Andy likes pulling the plunger back and watching the blood flow up into the needle. To be honest, Andy just plain likes getting high. Andy likes feeling alive for the first time for the thousandth time.

When Andy comes back to work from rehab, he’s usually full of energy. Andy runs through the halls as if making up for lost time. Andy, smart Andy, shows us why hes the best of us. He practically sings while solving problems and making money for the company. Because Andy is a great worker. He just happens to be addicted to heroin. Andy’s killing himself.

The worst days for Andy are the days right before payday. He’s borrowed money from everyone who’ll lend it to him. That set of people grows smaller by the week. His mother has hidden her cash, and it will be weeks before she forgets to hide it again. So on those days, Andy has a very short temper. He stomps around the office snarling at everyone.

Why are we letting you kill yourself Andy? Why don’t we stop you? We don’t hate you, (your mother loves you) but we keep watching you destroy yourself with heroin. Do you know the reason why? Does it come to you when you’re high? Is it something so awful that we wouldn't want to know?

Oh Andy, one day you walked in the door and saw your mother crying on the couch. You wanted to say something to her, you wanted to hug her, but it was payday and you had a bag of dope that you needed to shoot. So you walked right past her, up the stairs closed the door of your room and floated away. When you came back, your mother wasn't crying anymore. The moment had passed.

Remember the day they found you in the bathroom at work Andy? Passed out with a needle sticking out of your arm. You tied yourself off with a shoelace. We thought you were dead. But the EMT gave you a shot of something and you came right back to life again. You vomited, and then they took you away. Oh Andy, now there is no doubt in anyone’s mind. Now the whisper has become a roar.

But by tomorrow the roar has become a whisper. We make plans for the weekend. Plans for the summer. But we don’t make any plans to save you Andy. And soon we forget. And you’re back at work after a few weeks; smarter and funnier than ever. The old Andy is back. One day you asked to borrow twenty dollars; you said you lost your ATM card. Sure pal, anything for you buddy. Something gnawing at the back of my mind, like a memory trapped in a cage and fighting to escape.

You died that day Andy. Officially of an overdose. Oh Andy, what if I hadn't lent you that twenty? What if the dope hadn't been as strong? What if we had paid attention to you? What if, what if, what if? Oh, Andy.

Roger had to give her that. Her glistening chocolate hair draped over the supple curve of her breasts, framing an innocent, oval face. What's more, Vanessa was one of the highest ranked ballerinas in the country, so her body was tight and effortlessly graceful. And she was intelligent, a top student, loved by all her teachers. And she was passionate, voraciously tearing into cryptic Latin texts and twisted Shakespeare plays. And she was polite; she never misplaced a word or spoke ill of another in their presence. And finally, even in the face of this borderline perfection, she still managed humility.

But that's why Roger couldn't stand her. As she strutted from plebeian to plebeian pretending to commiserate with their inconveniences and chuckling hollowly at their awful jokes, you could sense her sentiment of superiority almost oozing through her skin, growing with each inferior she encountered. She only wasted her time with this mediocrity to vindicate her own accomplishments. Vanessa's act of humility was just that: an act.

It was certainly subtle. You had to look past her actions and question her motives. Why did she blush with every compliment? Why did she offer to help cute boys study? Why, when told she was smart, did she lightly assert that she'd never scored an A on a math test? Surely these are the signs of a humble, virtuous individual? Not when they're to garner attention and satiate her edacious ego.

When it came to guys, she never spoke first. That would make her seem desperate. Instead, she was to be so damn irresistible that cute boys would have to call her pretty and smart and beg for a date. Then she could giggle girlishly, lavishly deny their claims, and, after unctuously telling them how much she appreciated the offer, say no. That way, she'd always be desirable (guys want what they can't have, right?)

And it worked. Vanessa had plenty of top-notch suitors, but she never kissed a guy, probably never even went on a date. As she informed her friends, none had been worthy of her. She did, however, feel like the hottest shit on the planet. Guys sent her flowers, chocolates, poems, and snapchats and she flitfully played along, milking every last drop of attention from these doomed souls. If the stream of gifts dammed, she became irritated. Her teeth grinding together, her fingers fretfully crumbling her notebook paper, she would obsessively ponder how anyone could possibly not be attracted to her. She would question her own personal value (what if I'm not worthy of *him*?) and, awed by this young stud's ability to resist her, fall in love for the first time. But as soon as her subsequent batted eyelashes, slight smiles, and light laughs rekindled his fire, she, confidently returned to her throne of superiority, would dismiss her fleeting feelings and return to stringing him along, creating a vicious, inescapable cycle for the male whilst bolstering the ego of the female.

So what is a victim of this supposed cycle to do? In Roger's case, he will be content to silently and mercilessly judge her. Blood will gush angrily through his cheeks, adrenaline will force him to fidget and sweat, and his eyes will track her relentlessly across the room, but he will not utter a word. After all, no one can prove your error if you hide it and demonizing Vanessa is easier than accepting personal failure.

	Her Tinged Ciggerate’s heat radiated off into the back of my neck. I could feel her Presence. I couldn’t help but stare. Both me and my mother’s eyes were fixed on the slow burning Marlboro in her hand and the smoke that spit up her wrist. 
“I’m A Libertarian, I don’t like to be told what to do.”
She observed my mom, down to the heartbeat. As did I. We both hated everything my mom did. We both hated being told what to do by my mothers all seeing eyes.  
	She wasn’t the type of Libertarian who complains about Guantanamo Bay. She’s The Kind Of Libertarian who fucking drops Acid and goes to musical festivals. The epitimy of cool. Everything boring old me needed. Not only did she not have an opinion on Free trade economics SHE DIDN’T GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT FREE TRADE ECONOMICS. She smoked weed on the hood of homeland security vehicals. 
	The 14 in me wanted to end my conversation with her. Drugs, fun and freedom had taken there sweet toll on her body. Her hair was frizzed her clothes slightly tattered.  For being at the Jewish religious ceremony centered around death her shoeless feet dancing was quite the practice of someone celebrating life.  She was what a 65 year old women should be physically yet somehow she had redefined sexy for me in thirty seconds. We didn’t say much after that except small talk about “The fucking Bastard” known as Mayor Bloomberg. Everything she Said held so much weight. After our conversation came to a sad conclusion I mulled over her words like a priest reading the book of Mathew. I spent the rest of the night eating salled debating wether to go talk to her or not. I knew I would once have these debates with myself I didn’t know they’d would be about talking to someone who probably spent her morning opening social security checks. At a Shiva for all places! As if my pedophilic fantasies couldn’t get any worse, they had to be during a week that’s supposed to be filled with depression and tears. 
	I looked all around the party for her, I curled around all the corners of the house. Elevating myself above tables scanning across the circles of people looking for her. Sometimes I saw her, but than she would be gone and disappear into another women. Some moments I would see her twice, at other times it seemed she never existed.
	Well fuck. She’s gone. I had my chance; I could have gone back to her house and talked into the morning. We could have drank, laughed and loved. 
			KIDS THESE DAYS- Muriel Frumberg
	I had to get out of that shiva. My brother died for fucks sake, I can’t have one night of griping and smoking. This boy and his mother whom I had never met before came up to me wish me good luck or some shit. And they both stay fixated on the cigerates I was lighting back to back. People say they don’t care how you look, that’s bullshit. His mom looked so scared that I was talking to her son. Turns out this kid is some kind of Libertarian as well, he tried talking drones with me. Pathetic. I was minding my business my brother had just died. It was not the appropriate time for foreign policy discussion for fucks sake. 
	You should have seen this kid. He was fucking weird. His eyes constantly were shifting around. He didn’t let people walk behind him. If you left the fucking boy alone for a second he would start mumbling to himself. 
	I couldn’t help but feel bad for him. This kid’s definitely got something fucking wrong with him, probably have to do with something with his shitty bitch of a mother.

Aaron was acting a little weird.

DAVID: What exactly was he doing

SARAH: He was talking about an old woman
He was talking to “her” about drones and

It was all very eerie.
DAVID: What else is there to do?
More therapy? More meds? What?
SARAH: Part of me says yes. However,
This is the first time I’ve seen Aaron
Happy in a long time.
DAVID: Are you suggesting we just 
Let him live in his own little universe?

It was a place they often went to eat. Artie sat on the plastic bench across the table from Katie. Katie’s blue eyes looked larger, even more beautiful than usual. But though her eyes were wide, they had less depth.  It was as if the deep pools of her eyes had dried up, leaving pure calcite rings of white and shallow puddles of blue that had once been seas.

Artie stared down at the table top. The surface was brown formica with a fake pattern of wood grain. He looked up at Katie, she brushed a lock of her auburn hair away from her face.

“Are things going to be OK between us?” Artie said, his voice was flat.

“I don’t think so” Katie said.

“What did I do wrong?”

“Nothing” Katie said. Her voice was flat too, but it had an edge like anger.  It wasn’t anger, “It’s over between us. You left some of your stuff at my house. I put it in a box on the porch, you can come get it whenever”.

Artie’s right hand was gripping a little plastic arch with the number “12” on it.  Just then a voice came over the intercom, 

“Number 12”, the voice said.

Artie moved to slide off the bench and stood up, he looked down at Katie. “Are you going to stay and eat?”

“No” she pulled her purse over her shoulder and slid off the bench and stood up.  For a moment she and Artie stood close to each other. It didn’t help that she looked unusually beautiful.  Artie didn’t reach for her.  Even the habit of a parting embrace had dried up, his insides felt dried up. He stood feeling awkward for a moment. She looked very straight and dignified. Suddenly perfect. Then she turned and crossed the restaurant toward the door.  Artie’s eyes followed her as she pushed open the glass door and walked out into the parking lot. There was a big, arched window on either side of the door and he saw her as she crossed the parking lot. The warm March sun fell reddish on her hair.  It didn’t help that she looked very beautiful, even at a distance, walking across a parking lot.

“Number 12”, the scratchy intercom voice said again.

Artie went up to the counter and exchanged the plastic arch for a tray with their meals.  The tray held two lunch specials; tacos, enchiladas and piles of beans, orange rice and shredded, colorless lettuce.
 
Artie set the tray down on the table and picked at the food. Then he got up and walked to the restroom.  He cried a little bit in the bathroom stall then came back out.

When he came back from the bathroom, he saw one of the restaurant employees dumping the tray with the two lunch specials into a garbage can.  She looked up at him. She must have thought he was done eating.

Artie smiled at her vacantly and walked toward the exit.  He crossed the parking lot. That’s one thing that’s hard about being alone in the world, Artie thought as he got into his car; people throw your food away.

I woke up this morning on an unfamiliar couch clutching a peppergrinder in one  hand and a Red Bull in the other.  An angry, turgid sensation inside my mouth reminded me that I had been drinking last night; I sat up to get my bearings both my head and my gut rebelled in memory of just how much.  I eased back  into the couch, which I now noticed to be in a state that only added fuel to  my stomach's disobedience.  

I woke up a second time this morning with my face pressed to the musty upholstery of a vaguely familiar couch.  From my awkward vantage point, I gazed over a  landscape of matted greens, ranging from apple to zucchini.  The thought of food reminded me of the burgeoning revolution in my stomach, which, having  caught my attention once again, chose that particular moment to mount its  final offensive and break free of the injustices that I had so thoughtlessly imposed upon my body the previous night.  As I lay incapacitated by the uncontrollable heaving in my diaphragm, I recalled the objects that I clutched in either hand, and the more pressing matter of where the fuck I was.  

Laboriously, I raised my head for a second time this morning, and, for a second time this morning, I regretted it deeply.  However, spurred on by the powerful demons of shame and despair, I stood up unsteadily and plodded off in search of cleaning facilities.  The first thing I found was a coffee table.  Rather, my left foot found it.  I found a carpet whose must made a fresh meadow of my green friend. After some half-hearted struggling, I stood up again.  This time, accounting for  the noticeable spin of the world, I made my way to the nearest door, pausing only to pocket the peppergrinder in order to free the requisite appendages to open said door.    

In retrospect, I might have gleaned some clues as to the identity of my unfortunate  host by the clothes strewn across the floor, or the pictures on the wall,  or even by approaching the snoring occupant of the bed in the far corner of the room.  However, I had already relieved one of three plumbing urges in an inappropriate place and I was determined that the other two would be dealt with in a more orderly fashion in a more suitable location.  

As I stumbled through the crass early afternoon sun, I regretted every decision that I had made last night on the simple principle of the matter.  Marks on the back of my hand told me that I had frequented not one, but five fine, upstanding establishments of varying degrees of debauchery and a distinct lightness in my backpocket informed me that I was most likely in all sorts of financial trouble.  The optimist in me commanded that I look on the bright side of things, but my eyes screamed in  protest at every flash and glare they met with so I compromised and continued on without looking at all.    

To passers-by I must have been a sight.  The stride of my left leg was by far outpaced by that of my right, resulting in a stagger fit for a peg-legged pirate.  My lips were ashen with dehydration, but a suspiciously chunky smudge on chin and black tshirt informed any observer plainly that I must have expelled some precious fluid recently. Fortunately, my hairstyle was pristine, but that was only the intentional byproduct of a carefully maintained lack thereof.  I easily feigned a tired and vacant expression on my face and studiously avoided eyecontact with my silent judges by staring at my untied shoelaces until I reached my front door.  

There are few pleasures in life that outweigh that of a cold glass of water when your mouth is so dry you cannot move your tongue.  However, the pleasure is soon diluted when you reflect upon the series of events that have led to this eventuality.  Particularly, when the events are at best mere logical conclusions rather than an firm memory.  I take another deep draught of water and realize that instead of feeling more refreshed, I feel  the momentum of the liquid in my stomach with every motion of my body, accompanied by  splashing sounds which herald yet another act of excess.  My body is bloated by rash decisions which I suspect outline some form of avoidance behaviour, but I can't for the life of me pinpoint the exact cause thereof.  I put my moka on the stove and begin to  brew a strong cup of coffee and retire to the shower to wash away any remnants of the  night and my shameful start to the day.  

I fumble with the dial and am immediately punished with a barrage of ice cold needles which bite my skin, but that lasts for only a moment before the needles turn to fiery arrows  that melt my already soft flesh.  The rapid turn of events disorients me further and I  struggle to stand up straight.  The half dozen half empty bottles of formulaicly scented  body wash are not so fortunate and raucously tumble about in the halfpipe of my bathtub. After a few more adjustments of the dial, I return my attention to the disarray at my feet and slowly return them to their places, opening only the last bottle to squeeze out a few  drops of civilization to rub onto my body so that I can convince myself that I am presentable. I stand, face down, letting the water flow down my back contemplating an image of myself deep in pithy contemplation, conjuring a fantasy of reaching some yet unrevealed philosophical realization.  Finally, I realize that my coffee is burning.  

The sickly sweet smell of burnt coffee will penetrate every conceivable corner of my apartment, so I open few windows, grab a cigarette and step outside.  My clothes are decent but unremarkable, fashionable, but not avant garde, and spotless but not clean.  Between my formulaic bodywash and run of the mill deodorant, there is no evidence that I haven't done the laundry in weeks, but the ever so slight dullness in my clothes establishes an aura of mediocrity and shabbiness to my appearance.  Not so far as to imitate the trainwreck that I was this morning, far enough for me to feel as unimpressive as my shirt.  A few dark smudges on the backs of my hands are all the evidence I have left of the previous night.  Those, and my missing wallet and two souvenirs.  I crack open the Red Bull, even though my obnoxiously strong coffee has already  made me mildly giddy and apprehensive.  It is in this unremarkable state that I begin another dull Wednesday at 4PM.  

You see, being above average intelligence is a curse in this world.  I wish so dearly I could be as fullfilled as the average plebe by the wonders of popculture and consumer products.  That  Hollywood movies could both emulate blowing my mind and opening my eyes and that I could  aspire to a 9 to 5 at the local grocery store, settle for a bitchy wife with no particular function in society, and dream about women whose conversational abilities would overwhelm only the most naive of teacups.  Unfortunate me, I see the world through a finer lens at a higher resolution than most.  I am capable of great feats in the realms of art and science.  Should I  put my mind to it, I can understand the currents of politics or the fundamental shifts in societal values at a level worthy of my education.  My motivation is absent due to a lack of circumstance, not by any fault of my own.  There are those who are blessed with this obscene drive to do things. I am, unfortunately, not one of those people.  I something or someone to come by and start my engine and keep it running, but when that happens, I will achieve something great.  I get  flashes of inspiration that others dream of, you see.   I see that life is not worth living, but I'm not quite ready to disappear just yet, so I simply exist, floating.  

This is what I tell myself as I reach my office.  This what I tell myself to make everything seem ok. The hollow caffiene rush from the coffee and Red Bull makes it impossible to sleep at my desk, but the lack of energy and food makes it impossible for me to work, so instead, I surf the internet searching for that elusive flash of inspiration that will motivate me to achieve my potential. After a few hours, I prepare to leave.  It didn't happen today, but I only need that one in my lifetime, after all.  

Tomorrow, I will wake up in my bed at 1pm with a splitting headache, nauseated by the smell of burning coffee, throat parched and unable to hold a thought in my head until 4pm.  Tomorrow, I will wonder about what will have happened tonight and finally give up.  Tomorrow, I will come to the philosophical realization that nearly washes over me every day in the shower.  Tomorrow, I will have a flash of inspiration that will motivate me to get myself moving to the ultimate achievement which will justify the life I live. Tomorrow, today will no longer matter and I will no longer have to feel unremarkable in the mirror.  Tomorrow, I will no longer forget the precise point of my actions midway.  Tonight, I need another drink.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1gn036,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gn036/my_first_short_story_in_8_years/,

Nobody really comes to this sleepy town of maybe two hundred. To be honest, most people fear the town, well, except for those who want to explore the possibilities of their desires. Legend has it that if you have cash and a request, your life can change forever. You just have to go to the cabin on the lake and call for one of them.

“How can I help you?” The strange woman asked Marla in a voice apparently made of gravel. The room they sit in is dark with a single lantern by the door.

“I’m sorry I’ve never been to a witch before. I, I don’t know how to ask.” Marla said sheepishly.

The lady lifts a wrinkled finger and says with authority, “First, we aren’t witches and haven’t called ourselves such since the persecution. We are 'Artists'. Ask us how you would ask any other person.”

“I’m so sorry. I’m in love with my male roommate, his name is Charlie. I’m nothing but a friend to him and I’d like for him to love me back.”

The old Artist flips her long, salt and pepper hair back and laughs, “Girl, a person can only love what it shares flesh with. You can love your father and your mother, you can love your siblings, you can love your child, but you can never truly love someone outside of that connection.”

The young lady is taken back by that statement. “Yes I can love him and I do.”

“Then what do you love so much about him?”

“He’s kind. He has the most beautiful smile. He works out so he has an amazing body...”

“Stop right there”, the Artist interrupts “What you have just described to me are physical traits and surface behavior. You’re naturally in love with his genes rather than him as a person. You've only succumbed to his mating call. A call that he isn't even aware he's made.”

“Are you here to judge? I’m paying you for a service.”

“Now that money has changed hands, I am working for you. I just want to warn you.” Just as the artist made that statement the lantern flickered, even with the absence of wind. “You’re asking me to make someone do something that isn’t naturally possible.”

“Do it anyway.”

The woman has a belly laugh, shoots back in her chair, and stands up to walk to the other side of the room. “I have to warn you that our powers are a lot more mundane than the stories say. It will take me three days to make a love elixir. Until then, you can stay at the Inn in town. You can meet some of the others there”

Marla walks toward the door. “Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me child. After I finish this, he will love you. The manner in which he will love you is the mystery.”

Help me convince him to continue it.,BricksCanFly,5,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g0qyg/a_friend_of_mine_wrote_this_in_two_parts_for_a/,"Blackness greeted me when I woke. It took me a few more seconds to realize that the darkness was probably attributed to the fact that my eyes were closed. There was no improvement upon opening them, however, and I grew more and more concerned. I seemed to be in a box of some kind. I knew not where I was, or how I had gotten there. After a moment of panic I noticed a gentle soothing sound, almost similar to the sound of water rushing along rocks. I listened to it for a few more seconds, attempting to gain control of my mounting panic.

The control failed and my imagination took over. The sound began to seem more and more like the sound of dirt falling slowly onto a coffin. Was I being buried alive? My body stiffened at the thought. My hands ran over the inside of my box, searching for a way out. I would dig out if I had to. The air seemed to becoming thinner. How long would it be before I suffocated completely? I strained against the walls. I kicked the roof. I scratched the floor. Everything was smooth and metallic in texture except the soft memory-foam like material that I was resting on.

Then, my fingers caught on a depression in the metal, just above my chest. I brought both of my hands up to try and figure out what it was. A click and a soft hissing noise filled my small enclosure as I pushed the button. Light spilled in from the sides, as the lid of what I had thought was my casket began to open automatically. I sat up slowly, blinking away the spots that had showed up in response to the light.

The sight that greeted me was hardly the dark gloomy setting of a cemetery. I seemed to be in a long white hallway. What looked like windows on the walls were made from one-way glass, blocking my view of what was outside of my mysterious hallway. All around me were more of the coffin-shaped boxes, although I could see now that they were very modern in their design. They were made of the same white plastic material that made up the rest of the hallway and each had a gently glowing blue light on the end. Upon closer examination I realized that my light had turned to a harsh red.
I began to try and stand up when a screen suddenly came to life on the wall across from mine and a thin, almost fake-looking woman’s face appeared in the center.

Her voice rang through the halls with a short message: “Hello, and welcome to the future! It is very possible that you are experiencing momentary memory loss. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we assure you that it is only temporary. To help your memory recover, please watch the following film summarizing your own history and that of the others around you. Enjoy!”

The screen flickered and images began to run across the screen of what I assumed were important events in the past. I saw ruined cities, flooded plains, dried-out farms, and homes on fire. A new, gentler voice began to narrate the images.

“In the past, it became clear to us that history was repeating itself over and over again. The same problems were reccurring every few hundred years, sometimes with disastrous consequences. After going through the same types of issues many times, it became obvious that the outcomes of those events were based mainly on the leading people of the nations involved. Environmental problems were best addressed when someone with the correct motivation and personality was able to come out and lead others away from destructive tendencies. Social problems were an enigma to those who did not have an intuitive sense of how to deal with them. Wars were lost without leaders who truly understood the principles or war. That is why we developed a way to keep those types of people in reserve for a rainy day. You are aboard the product of that research right now. You are on the Starship Ares.”

Once the video stopped, all that remained was the strange watery sound that I had heard before. I figured now that it was the sound of some sort of machinery aboard the ship, but it still made me somewhat nervous. I had never been aboard a spaceship that I could remember, no matter what the lady in the television was telling me. Then again, I couldn’t remember much of anything.

I began to try and stand up, but just as I started to move, a door opened at the end of the corridor and an extremely pale man walked through. I tried to rise faster, but found that my legs were almost completely useless. I could barely move them.

“Just a moment, master. I’ll be right there,” said the pale man as he came towards me. “Your leg muscles have atrophied a bit, I imagine. It has been a long time since you were last woken.”

I didn’t respond, but stared warily at the stranger. He seemed to know me, and yet his face was not familiar. He came up to the side of my box and knelt beside it. He was very tall, and even on his knees he towered over me. He wore a flowing robe of white, with four separate pockets sewed in to the sides. Out of one he pulled what looked like a gun. I strained my legs in trying to rise and defend myself, but he pushed me gently back down onto the foam beneath me.

“Relax, master. It will help you to move your legs and the rest of your body. It is a drug that will stimulate growth in your muscles. You have been in one position for a very long time, and though the ship has done its best to care for you, there are some side-effects. This will counter them.”
Realizing that I didn’t have much of a choice, I relaxed my body back down and allowed him to inject me with whatever it was. He applied it to each separate major muscle in my legs, and I could feel a cool soothing feeling travelling up my legs. I found I could move my toes and eventually I was able to shift my legs. He continued with the same process around the rest of my body. I had been very sore initially, and this brought great relief.

“Who are you?” I asked. “What am I doing here?”

He looked at me with an almost bemused look. His face was long and his eyes were an almost luminous blue. He had no hair or eyebrows, and when he opened his mouth, I could see that it was almost black. Even with this somewhat alarming combination of facial features, he had a kind face.

“I am hurt, master. You do not remember me? I have served by your side for many years, and in many battles. I am Frederick, but you usually call me Fred unless you are angry at me,” he said, smiling. “As for what you are doing here, the video explained that. You are here to save the world,” he continued, before saying finally, “again.”

The lightest of creases, the sign of someone who frequently wore a smile, highlighted wonderful, kissable lips. Even the way she carried herself, her light step, the sway of her hips when she walked. She stood tall and straight, her shoulders not proud, but confident. Comfortable. He couldn't help but feel a sense of fulfillment when he saw her.

She gasped quietly, noticing him. Her eyes were angry, still somehow beautiful even then, but he didn't blame her. Noone like to be caught off their guard, but it was something he did playfully, feeling like a little boy again. He rushed to her, to take her in loving embrace. She had managed no more than half of her question, which would go unanswered. ""What are you d-"" She tried to ask, but he had already scooped her up, and regrettably, with a little more force than he intended: her question tapered off with a squeak as he carried her to her bed.

He lay her down delicately, holding her with a firm but gentle grasp. She even played at struggling, the way he so loved. His face close to her own, he took in her breath, so sweet, and comming in rushed, clipped little gasps. Her eyes were wild, urgent, waiting. Her mouth opened to speak, but lovingly he placed a hand over it. This was a moment where words were unneccesary, even unwanted. And besides, he was a little shy, and preferred this forbidden act be quiet. This was a moment between the two of them, and meant for them alone. 

With the words aside, if you are quiet and listen, the body can speak volumes. The physical manifestation of feelings that simply cannot be expressed with words. Her shallowing, rushed breaths, the way her heartbeat sped up at his touch, the urgency, the longing, the need. He would drink it all in greedily, this was his ambrosia.

A happily occupied hand made its way down, caressing as it went. Feeling every dip and curve. She was a beautiful creature, the dress that concealed her body suddenly seemed a hateful thing. He put that aside though, his hand still moving to a happier, lower place. It didn't matter anyway, her garb wouldn't keep him from what he wanted.

She inhaled sharply, and with a jolt. The sudden movement succedded only in drawing her closer to him as he entered her. Warmth rushed over his fingers. She moaned, the sound muffled by his hand. She still played at struggling, but it was lessening now. her hand reaches out, grabbing forcefully at his vest. The other hand, with no clear goal, simply grabbed the bedsheets with a white-knuckled grip. Her eyes close in a wince, and beneath his hand, he can feel her jaws clench together. The motions are repeated on both sides, again and again. He enters, and she shudders against him. She seemed to slow, however, the time between her struggled breaths longer and longer. She was comming close, and he had no intentions of stopping now.

One final motion, every muscle in her body contracting, one last forced breath, drawn out longer than all the others, a deep, slow exhale. She lay back, now very still. Quiet, and her eyes still shut from her previous exertion. He lay his forhead against her own, and slowly withdrew his hand from her mouth, listening to the quiet. The only sound was his own labored breathing. The silence that came after had its own sort of beauty, and he took the time to appreciate it.

After a long moment, he withdrew. The delicate, curved dagger he held slid silently from her ruined belly. He stepped back, surveying this now grisly scene with a distant, emotionless gaze. She had grown pale, her skin now nearly as colorless as the blood soaked sheets on her bed. Her leg hung awkwardly off the side of her mattress, but she gave no indication of discomfort. Her face had settled into a terribly familiar expression, that wonderful, horrible peace one only felt in their final moment in the world. Her eyes bothered him, though, dispelling the peaceful expression with a half lidded squint.

He almost reached out, wanting to close those eyes... almost. But that wouldn't be right.

His senses, still heightened, picked up the delicate rattle of keys from just outside. He made his way quickly across the house, to the window he had entered, and was outside, quiet as a ghost. He strode casually into the alley, without even a glance back. Noone paid him any heed as he went, something else had everyones attention. A mans anguished cry filled the air, and something in the sound seemed to reverberate among the people: a collective shudder filled everyone walking by, as though someone had run a nail down a chalk-board. Cutting the corner into the alley did nothing to lessen the sound for him, nor did it shield him from the sound that accompanied it, the sound of crying children.

He stepped out of the alley, and into a waiting carriage. ""Lets go. I have an appointment to keep."" He scarecly heard the drivers reply, he wasn't listening. It was the sound of horses hooves and the darkness of the carriage that dominated his attention, the sensations coaxing him into the familiar, dark places in the back of his mind. He dreamed his dreams, and sat silently in the darkness, waiting for his chance.

He waited... and waited...
And waited.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1fpk2x,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fpk2x/this_forbidden_act/,

At some point in human evolution, we shifted from ignorance of ourselves as a species to an obsession with our own superiority. Two legs and a complex brain, and now we are something quite different. This is widely accepted as fact, that we are better because we are smarter. We are human.

However, the truth is that we still are animals at some level. Our hearts are made one part good, one part evil, one part human. Mixed in among the blend  is an animalistic element, and it is the single most terrifying truth of our existence.

We have spent thousands of years building gaps between ourselves and our animal heart. We organize ourselves in ways animals don’t and retain self-image in ways animals wouldn’t think to. We pleasure seek, explore, invent and create, converse and enjoy each other’s company in ways animals can’t. We would like to forget our embarrassing past among the tall grass, sucking on bone marrow to survive, hunched against the cold in our dingy, primeval cave.

But as I drove down the highway, the highway that civilization spawned, that technology brought forth from unevenness, smoothed by progression and innovation, and as I listened to the radio that man invented, that harnesses and controls some part of the natural spectrum of existence, the same existence that man claims superiority too, I heard the pound of the bass, the beat of the song. The beat of our animal heart, breaking through an art form. It was loud, meant to be heard but more importantly meant to be felt. It was sex, wild, unrestricted, unmodified, thoughtless. It was adrenaline, murder, blood-thirst, terror, the possibility of hunting and being hunted.

All that matters anymore is the beat. It is instinctual. It is the easiest part of ourselves to facilitate. Being human is more complex and carries with it melodies and verses filled with societal responsibilities, a conscious awareness of self and shamefulness, and need for intellectual stimulus. We do not understand it, we cannot control it, and most often we repress it in pursuit of animalistic ambition. It is societies’ greatest irony that our animalism, our animal heart, is our most grievous embarrassment as well as our most facilitated being.

I believed her. I still do.” I looked out the window, ignoring Hugo. Everything was grey outside. Ya, it was winter alright. This place is too damn cold. Turn up the fucking heater Nurse.
“Mario.” God his voice is so annoying. Sounds like the spoiled pomeranian bitch that old geezer neighbor owns. 
“Mario!” 
“Shut the fuck up!” The doctor down the hall snapped his head up. Thought I said that in my head. Hugo’s upper lip shriveled a bit. There were no words for minutes. Why is it that every single time I retort back to the cunt in a “non-suitable” way, he starts crying. Pussy.
“I’m going to the cafeteria.” He was looking down at the tile, which, honest to God, looks like a mirror. If it’s one thing I could talk good about this joint, it’s that they make sure this place is spotless. I was making my way down the hall, looking down, admiring the tile when the nurse and I exchanged shoulders. 
“Oops! I’m sorry.” she said in a shallow voice. She seemed out of breathe.
“Ya...my bad.”
Her smile was very subtle, but promising. Her lips were pale. They stood out against her red hair. She needs to put a comb through that mess.
“Your mom’s glucose levels are returning to normal.”
I gave her a cold stare. Why? I don’t know. I was toxic.
“That’s... good?”
She nodded, only to catch her head halfway.
“It’s an improvement Mario, the coma hasn’t improved though.”
I turned and walked down the hall without saying another word. Fuck that nurse anyway. I looked out the windows of the corridor leading to the commons. Still grey outside. Another night of rain it seemed like. Great.
Chatter rose, the intercom continued to echo, and the busy hall of the hospital was filled with doctors, patients, family, and everyone in between. Same old shit. Doctor talk and prayers.
“Change the world my ass” I said under my breathe. 
Then out of the corner of my eye, I heard wheels screeching. A high speed chase in a hospital? This I got to see. When I turned my head, I saw an older woman being wheeled down the hall on a stretcher. 
“Move! Move! Out of the way! Out of the way!” yelled the nurse wheeling her. I shimmied over to the wall. I peered over to the woman on the stretcher as she passed by a hundred miles an hour. Her skin was lifeless, her eyes looking toward the ceiling, absent of blinking. My heart dropped. I looked down the hall back where I ran into the nurse, I saw a boy, twelve or thirteen, gasping for air, crying uncontrollably. He was all alone. No parents, no adults. Maybe that was his...Mom. He followed the stretcher into the room, only to be blocked by the doctor. That was his mom. She has his eyes.
“This way champ. Don’t worry your mom...will...” a pearl streamed down the doctors cheek. The boy noticed, and his face instantly filled with grief. The doctor grabbed the boys wrist, and wiped the tear with the other, trying to hide it. He took the boy through a door just a few doors down where the woman went in. “
Is she go..going...to...”
He started bawling like a loose fire hydrant. He sounded like he was being tortured. The door shut. I lost my appetite.
“Code red, room 13B, repeat code red!” the intercom belted. An army of doctors ran into the room where the woman was held. Yells erupted in the room, but the door slammed shut, leaving the hall in an eerie silence.
 I looked at Hugo down the hall. He was still looking down at the mirrored floor, his jet black hair obvious amongst the grey clouds through the window. 
“Hugo! Hugo!” He looked my way. I beckoned. He got up, and came running. He smiled instantly when he caught up. My heart warmed. “Let’s get some food man, you’ve been here for days.” 
“Fuck cafeteria food Mario.” We chuckled.
“Let’s get some dogs. I know a place.” We both smiled. God it’s been years since that’s happened.
“It’s on you bro, after all you are the lawyer.” I punched him, he flinched, and I wrapped my arm around him, and put him in a headlock.
“I love you man.” I said.  We walked down the hall, leaving the chaos of this hell-ridden institution behind. Mom would have loved to see us together like this.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1etm1t,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1etm1t/grey_778_words_critique_welcomed/,

There was this one day during elementary school where my mom came to say hello to me. I was so embarrassed.
How could she do this to me? I ignored her, threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day at school one of my classmates said, “EEEE, your mom only has one eye!”
I wanted to bury myself. I also wanted my mom to just disappear. I confronted her that day and said, “If you’re only gonna make me a laughing stock, why don’t you just die?”
My mom did not respond… I didn’t even stop to think for a second about what I had said, because I was full of anger. I was oblivious to her feelings.
I wanted out of that house, and have nothing to do with her. So I studied real hard, got a chance to go abroad to study.
Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. I had kids of my own. I was happy with my life, my kids and the comforts. Then one day, my Mother came to visit me. She hadn’t seen me in years and she didn’t even meet her grandchildren.
When she stood by the door, my children laughed at her, and I yelled at her for coming over uninvited. I screamed at her, “How dare you come to my house and scare my children! GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!!!”
And to this, my mother quietly answered, “Oh, I’m so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address.” – and she disappeared out of sight.
One day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. So I lied to my wife that I was going on a business trip. After the reunion, I went to the old shack just out of curiosity.
My neighbors said that she died. I did not shed a single tear. They handed me a letter that she had wanted me to have.
“My dearest son,
I think of you all the time. I’m sorry that I came to your house and scared your children.
I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I may not be able to even get out of bed to see you. I’m sorry that I was a constant embarrassment to you when you were growing up.
You see……..when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn’t stand watching you having to grow up with one eye. So I gave you mine.
I was so proud of my son who was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye.

Lyra stood in the doorway of the dressing room, her hands placed expressively on either hip. She knew that it was time to speak up. She would give the Master one last chance, but she had a feeling that this would be his final show.

“Ah yes, my sweet Lyra. What do you come about for? You've hardly any makeup on yet! Don't you know the show's about to start? Go get...”

“I'm not performing with you tonight.” she said, as firmly as she could.

“Excuse me?” the Master replied, dumbfounded. His mouth hung slightly agape.

“I'm done with the show. I'm not doing it anymore. You're going to have to find a new assistant.”

At this point, she knew there was no retracting her sentiment. She stood in the doorway, grasping the frame with palms of nervous sweat.

“Well, Lyra, I... Frankly I... I don't think you're in any position to make such brash decisions.” His face  glistened with the same sweat of her palms. “You signed the contract, and the contract says...”

“You drugged me, you bastard.” She was beginning to shudder with pent up rage, anger coursing readily through her heated veins. “I couldn't even speak when I signed that thing. You promised me money, fame, love...”

“...But the promises of a madman are as empty as your pretty little head, aren't they darling?” The nervous sweat had vanished from his face, replaced with only the darkest shades of malevolent confidence. The chuckle that followed was far from hearty.

Not once did Lyra move her gaze from his. She knew he would refuse to release her, and now that he had, she cognized the weight that his refusal carried. This brought her some emotional relief. She knew his triumph would be short-lived.

“Now go put on your things, you filthy slut.” He moved his eyes from hers and peered down into his tobacco pipe. A swift light drew out a large plume of smoke, and a few puffs later he returned his stare. “If you're not ready in five, you're in for one hell of a beating.”

She realized that the only viable response was to feign momentary subservience. “Yes master.” she replied, with an eerie calmness to her tone. She had stopped shaking; her anger had subsided. She knew that she had won, but the Master knew not.

As sharp as he was, he found nothing awry with her sudden obedience, and seemed more than pleased that his threats had done their job. “Yes, good girl. Now off with you!” Elements of playfulness pervaded his own tone, underscoring his outright insanity.

Lyra turned on her heel and walked to her dressing room. The door hung slightly open, and she pushed it the rest of the way in with her body. She knew it would be her final visit, so she made a point to gather the few things she truly cared for.

“Hairbrush, mace, lockpicks...” She briefly ran through a mental list of things to keep. When she got to the end, her suitcase was practically overflowing. She paused and thoughtfully gazed at her sandals.

“This is it.” She said to herself. She reached her hand into the hidden compartment of the suitcase and pulled out “the instrument” – a common knife with a single edged blade sharpened to a razor point. The Master seldom allowed her to use utensils when they ate together, but she had managed to garner the knife following the post-meal alcohol daze of his Friday eve meat feast.

The illumination of the red light in the hallway caught her attention as it reflected off of the blade in her hand. The show was starting - it was time to go. Her stature was firm and her goal clear in her mind as she strutted towards the stage, grasping the instrument for dear life.

She heard the roar of the audience as was blinded by the incessant haze of the overhead lights. Everyone had come to see the Master perform his tricks, fooling them as charmingly as he had her on the night that she was signed into servitude.

“And now...” roared his voice, “put your hands together for my lovely assistant... Lyra!”

The audience was familiar with this routine. Every member applauded her entry with great enthusiasm, for the more they expressed, the more bewildering the Masters tricks would be.

As she walked onto the platform, the applause tapered off abruptly, perhaps with the most acute decrescendo of the century. They saw her dressed casually, not as her usual subservient self. Boos began to replace former cheers, and the master felt a fair mix of anger and embarrassment.

He marched over to her while waving at the audience with a 'just a moment' gesture. “What on great mother earth do you fancy you're doing, you little whore? You're ruining the show! I told you to get your act together! And what the bloody hell are you fumbling with!?”

As her arm shot towards his collar, his eyes widened with terror. She plunged the instrument deep into the front of his neck, and it penetrated his adam's apple with ease. To her, it felt as if she were cutting butter.

He managed to let out a few exasperated gurgles before she slid the knife further up the sides of his neck. As it severed his carotid artery, blood spurted from the resulting wounds in a manner that seemed almost cartoonish. It was an unsettling sight, but she relished in the moment like none other, watching his life slowly drain away, his hatred and cruelty being replaced by emptiness and his consciousness slipping deeper into the void of oblivion.

Most of the members of the audience had left in a panicked frenzy. However, one particular man, deluded as he was, came up onto the stage and began to charge at Lyra, thinking her to be some sort of murderer who needed to be brought to proper justice.

She had very little time to finish her task. She looked the Master in his near-vacant eyes one last time as he lay on the polished hardwood floor of the stage, his brain cells rapidly atrophying. “It's all in your eyes, Master.” she whispered. “It's all in your eyes.”

With that, a swift kick to the head did him in. She hastily recovered the Nekraf from his front suit pocket, a device that could teleport the user to any destination of their choosing. Just before the enraged man grabbed the bottom portion of her blouse, she closed her eyes, pressed the prime button, felt a sharp jolt, and vanished into thin air. He stood around confused for a few more moments, looking up, down and every which way, but ultimately concluded that she truly was gone. In a minutes time, no one was left in the house save for the corpse of the accursed Master himself.

His show was no more, his tricks no longer existent. His mind control was nullified, and most of the audience members had recovered their full wits and were flabbergasted as to what they'd just experienced. Many speculated, but none remembered for sure. The Master was a forgotten man, his show a sullen piece, and his evils finally lain to a well-deserved rest.

Lyra awoke on a sunny beach of crystal blue waters, palm trees surrounding her sunken form. She stood up and looked into the distance, eyes set upon a singular tropical cabana.

“Home.” she said to herself, in near disbelief. “I'm finally home.”

She walked on.

I’ve never had a very good memory. Not really. People always say things like “do you remember when…?” And I always say: 

“No? When was that?”

 It’s not embarrassing or anything. Just a pain. It’s just like a blank. I mean – God, I cant even remember where I was when I remembered this…but I'm pretty sure its my first memory. I don’t even know what I was doing. Maybe having coffee, or watching TV but it struck me – like I just got winded…Yeah…it was just like that…just like ‘doof.’

Wait, now I remember. I was on a bus coming home from the supermarket. There was this little boy who got on. He had this big bag on and her was wearing this puffy jacket. He was also wearing this beanie that was miles too big for his head. It was funny how it kept falling over his eyes. He waded up the aisle as the bus rocked from side to side. He was all by himself, and I thought I bet his mum gave him heaps of instructions for the ride… ‘sit at the front,’ ‘say thank you’ ‘remember to get off at the pools’, and then, there she was, my mum, just like doof. 

At first I remembered, well had this image of my toes, teeny and tiny, and how I could only see peaks of the hard wood floor underneath. It was varnished and had all these holes from people wearing heels at dinner parties and stuff. Mum, well I'm not sure ok? But in my head, my Mum was wearing these violet blue heels. They were her favorite pair. They had this big thick heel with like a silver broach thing on at the front. My feet were so soft and pudgy and I always remember thinking that her feet, in those heels, looked old, ugly and thin. 

I was looking down because she was above me, giving me instructions on how to get to the diary.

“You go down…Grace, are you paying attention?” She paused and coughed into her fist. She had her eyes closed and when she opened them again, catching her breathe, she continued. “See this shape, this L – that your hand makes when you hold it up like this?” She grabbed my hand in her cold thin one and traced the lines from the tip of my small index finger to the end of my thumb. I looked at my hand, they same way I stared at the glass wind chime that hung from our doorway or bugs in the dirt…I had no idea what she was talking about. “You see this L?” She asked. “That’s left; you take a big L, a big left, at the end of the street. Then you just keep going to you see the place with the big ice cream on top.  You know, the diary?”

Of course I knew. Its where I use to get pies with dad on Sundays, its where I got lollies with Joan. It was the place I stared at from the car window as we drove past. That big plastic Ice Cream cone on top was so cool. Sometimes it  lit up at night, it glowed like the moon. I use to stare at for hours.

“Take this money and get me some milk please and if you want you can get a mix while there. We can share the lollies ok?”

I smiled. “I’m not going to share any with you.”

She put her hands on her hips and stuck her tongue out at me. I copied her and then we both laughed. 

I can see myself. Brown eyes, hair pulled back in a loose plait, two strands falling over my face. But I can see her more clearly. She stood tall over me, with her peach dress. It looked like the smell of peach lollies, or maybe, peach lollies reminded me of the dress. Both are sweet I guess. She was always in that dress. If I think about it, I doubt she was wearing that peach dress with those violet heels that would’ve been ghastly. But as I say, in my head that’s what she was wearing. 

She wore her hair like mine, hazel brown, loose plait. Except her eyes were cloudy blue. She had thin lips and small teeth. She was my Mum and despite her hands and feet, I though she was pretty. 

I remember walking out the door and I knew that the world was too big for me. Not consciously, like I didn’t think that, but I knew that the world was too big – it was way too far to go. But Mum was sick, even then and that was greater than the size of the world. I squinted down the street. I was determined to get that milk.

It was a really hot day. The kind of hot you only remember when your little, like when you stare mesmerized, by the heat waves radiating off the cars or you have to lick your hand cause there’s melted ice cream all over it. It was that hot, cicadas blasting away hot, old men fanning their faces with their hats hot. I wiped my brow with the back of my arm and walked out, trying to remember what Mum said. I kept holding up my hands up in front of the sky, but they both made L’s if you turned them around, and I suppose I confused myself. By the time I reached the end of our street, I had no clue where to go. 

Fuck it was scary, I stood on the street for ages looking both ways, my little ponytail wiping back and fourth and I needed to pee so bad. I was getting so worried. I kept imaging mum in her peach dress coughing over the sink or on her knees leaning over the toilet. My lips began to tremble. Luckily this old guy in a hat ended up coming along. He had a moustache that reminded me of polar bears and snow. He was real nice. He asked me where I wanted to go then walked me to the store. 

When we arrived at the store he let go of my hand and asked if I was going to be ok. I pulled at my dress and looked around the store, it looked huge. Even if I stood on tiptoes I couldn’t reach the shelves and everything was so bright and confusing. 

“Um yup I think so.” I said. He smiled at me, and then I remembered, “thank you for helping me.” 

“You’re welcome little lady” and then off he went, out of the doorway. I never saw him again, I never found out who he was. 

Inside it was cool, all the drinks were so colorful in the fridge, they glistened behind the glass. I couldn’t see above the counter, but I could feel Eric’s (that’s the guy who owned the dairy), I could feel his eyes on me. I tried to act all grown up so I walked past all the lollies and junk, pushing my hair out of my eyes and went straight to the milk. The big bottles where up top and they were really hard to reach. 

“Do you want a hand?” Eric called out

“No thanks” I called back and I grabbed the biggest one I could.

It was so slippery, I remember it just falling to the ground and plopping open. Milk went everywhere. Eric came over and I was just standing there watching the milk move slowly across the floor, like it was invading the shop. I looked up at Eric with my mouth open, my eyes big like circles.  

He said, “Now what has happened here?” 

It was then, that I burst into tears. 

Eric must have come over mopping up the white milk as it seeped into the store, but I can’t remember any of that. The next thing I remember was Mum. She was there in her peach dress. She stood flushed in the face. She looked round the store then down at me, and gave me the best smile in the world. For most of the journey home, I had my face buried in her shoulder. I could smell her skin. It smelt just like powdered peaches.

 “Ssssshhhhh” she said. “ssssh sssssh its ok, its ok, Mummy’s here now, everything’s going to be ok, I promise” Her words tickled my ear, they were soft and flawless. 

I raised my head, wiped at my eyes with my fist, and licked the ice cream she bought me, before it melted all onto my hand. The last thing I remember about that day, was that her promise came true and everything was ok. 

*

Later, I remembered, I was holding her much older, much thinner and much more spotty hand. She lay on her side and breathed in slowly, they spaces in between filled only with my heartbeat. She stared at me with her big blue cloudy eyes. I looked back; my brown eyes were red and wet. Mum was waiting to die.

Her mouth was open and she had no more of her little pretty teeth. Just a black hole. Her long hazel hair had turned white and curly. 

She continued to breathe slowly…slowly, slowly. She never blinked. She never took her eyes off me. There was no one else in that room. Just me and Mum. Outside, everything carried on as usual but inside my Mum was dying and there was nothing I could do.

I squeezed her hand and said to her “Mum, its ok, I'm here now, you can go, don’t be scared, everything is going to be ok” 

She looked back at me until something inside disappeared. My mum had continued to breathe, until she stopped. Her old, thin, spotty hand, cold already, grew colder. I realized I was no longer holding a hand. Now it just felt like a cold thing. She no longer moved. Not even a flutter. The little that was left behind those blue eyes had gone. I continued to stare at her only now there was no one looking back.

I breathed in as my eyes grew wet and said, “Its ok, its ok, you’re alright now mum, I promise, everything’s going to be alright now.”

And as I breathed out, I hoped that it was.

I didn’t know where I was going, but I knew that any place was better than what I was leaving behind.  All that was for sure in that moment was what I could feel. Mostly it was excitement I suppose. I was filled with unusual sensations and irregular emotions, for me at least.

It was too dark to see anything other than what was in the small cone of light shining from the front of the cycle. Even in that, I couldn’t much see around the burly, warm leather coat around which I clung as we sped down the freeway.  Occasionally I would catch glimpses of shapes along the side of the road, but I couldn’t be sure on that either. All that I was certain of was the low rumble of the motorcycle’s engine, the deep, pounding vibrations through the seat, and the wind blowing his hair in every direction above me. 

Who was he? I didn’t know then. Hell, I don’t even know now. He was necessary. He was my ticket out of that God-forsaken hole my aunt and uncle called a “life.” As we continued down the surprisingly desolate highway, I lost track of the time. There was nothing to do; nothing to see. It was as if the very night was providing me a much-needed respite. The miles rapidly distanced me from the city I once called home and with every tick of the clock, I felt like as if a weight was being lifted from my shoulders. 

It was surprisingly freeing knowing that I was writing my own destiny in that moment. I had no idea what my future would hold, I just knew the road, the rumbling, and the warm leather that belonged to my savior that night. Sooner than expected, the sun began to rise to my left. Apparently we had spent all night riding Southbound. I did not know and I did not care. Any direction aside from backward was fine with me. I estimated we traveled about six hundred miles that first night, although nothing was certain in my new life. 

He finally stopped for fuel in a small town on the intersection of two freeways. I thanked him from the bottom of my newly-freed heart, grabbed my knapsack and walked down the main street of the town. It was a very small place, seemingly sprung from necessity of the two highways. The buildings were all rather run-down, constructed thirty or forty years ago with cheap vinyl siding. As I walked through the streets, I pondered my situation. I could be anything here. No one knew me, or knew of my past. I was a blank slate to them. In that moment of revelation, I was even a blank slate to myself.

I made it through to the other side of the town in short fashion. There was nothing there aside from a small convenience station with one weather-beaten red pickup sitting idle at a fuel pump and a four way intersection. Since I hadn't eaten in over a day, I decided to wander into the store.

To this day, I don’t know why I chose that quick-stop, nor could I have ever known the importance it would play in shaping the rest of my life. As I pulled the door open, I was greeted by the familiar, *ding dong,* that accompanies most station doors to alert the cashiers that it’s time to stop smoking and get back to work. The checker was a wrinkled lady about three times my age. She had a peculiar rasp to her voice that was somehow reminiscent of both Northern Ireland and Southern Kentucky. The only other person in the shop was a strikingly handsome brunette boy whose physique reminded me of a young Robert De Niro. As I walked past the drink coolers to the food aisle, I caught a smell of blackberries and tobacco coming from his direction.

I grabbed my food, paid the cashier, and sat outside of the shop to eat. I was devouring a bag of pretzels and a bottled water when he exited the store, *ding dong.* He headed toward his truck, but stopped midway, turned around, and headed my direction instead. He took off his maroon and silver jacket, probably earned from a local high school football team, and sat next to me. He introduced himself as “Sam” and said I didn’t look like I was from around here. I wanted to reply with, “Fuck off, can’t a girl eat in peace?”, but something about him made me reconsider. I ended up telling him my name was Beth, (really the name of a bitchy waitress from a diner near my aunt and uncle’s house), and that I was indeed not from “around here.”

Sam asked me if I needed a ride somewhere, and I told him anywhere would be fine. He could tell by my bag the kind of traveler I was that day.  As it were, he was headed 35 miles to the West of that small town to meet some friends for a bonfire. He picked up my bag, lightly tossed it into the bed of the truck and opened the passenger door for me. I rolled my eyes at his smug grin. Sam thought he was such a gentleman, but I knew better. 

His truck was just as rickety as it looked. It couldn’t go faster than fifty without wobbling fiercely. More importantly, the radio was out. Unfortunately, noise from the engine and wind was not a viable excuse for not talking, so we made small talk for that hour. He talked a lot about himself and his dumb friends.  He had just graduated a few months prior and was looking to join his cousin in who cares where selling something or other.  I figured that I might as well humor Sam in listening to stories of his mundane life as long as he was helping me escape mine. 

After what seemed like hours in that truck, we arrived at a campground that was located just off of a golf course. It was close enough to civilization to be convenient, but far enough removed that I didn’t have to worry about someone catching a news report about me, as if they would have even noticed I had left. Sam’s friends arrived thirty minutes after we did, and my memory only lasts about twenty-five minutes into the party after that.

When I woke up, Sam and his friends had already left. I was lying in a meadow of tall grass underneath a sprawling oak tree. The sun was perfectly overhead, with a slight warm breeze rustling through the green leaves. I felt surprisingly comfortable and relaxed for someone who slept outside on the ground. I stood up and started looking for my bag. Unfortunately, it was nowhere to be found. Surprisingly, neither was the golf course, or the campsite, or any remains of a fire. The only remarkable terrain was the tree and a white marble statue off in the distance. 

I couldn’t believe it. I knew Sam was an asshole: I had seen it in his cocky smile. Those, ugh, those cretins stole my things and dumped me God knows where, with no directions. I decided to head towards the only other landmark I had, which was clearly manmade. As I walked, I started to notice that it was further away than I had originally estimated, and much, much larger. It was what felt like thirty minutes by the time I arrived at the base, although the sun hadn’t moved an inch in the sky. It was a large marble plinth, thirty feet tall and forty feet wide at the base, with a staircase spiraling around the outside.

I thought I could perhaps see further from a higher vantage point, to gain at least some bearings on my surroundings. As I climbed the steps, I started to have a feeling in the bottom of my stomach. It was the same feeling I had before planning to run away in the first place, despair. As I crested the top of the round structure, now about 15 feet across, I saw a birdbath, right in the middle made out of the same marble as the plinth below it. The feeling inside me seemed to be drawing me towards the center, where the water sat in the stone. I approached and placed my hands on the edge to see a familiar landscape in the depths of the fluid, which was not quite water.

The campsite from the night before was shown in the harsh lighting of sunrise. The fire looked hastily extinguished and there were tire treads in the dirt leading away, apparently Sam and Co. had left in a hurry. Upon closer inspection, I realized why. Under the picnic table was a figure I immediately recognized, except she was in rough shape. Her clothes, what clothes were left on her, were shredded and flapping in the breeze. She was covered in bruises and lying unceremoniously in a puddle of foul dark liquid.

I had to look away. In that moment, I was filled with a mixture of terror and humility. Just as soon as it hit me though, the feeling passed, and I was filled with an indescribable calm. I sat on the top of the plinth, far from the bowl as possible, and contemplated. Then, as I was staring into space, I saw motion in the corner of my eye. The great oak tree’s branches were twisting about, writhing and twirling, until it wasn’t a tree anymore at all. Realizing my situation fully, I left the plinth behind me for good and headed toward the newly-formed gates. 

I knew then, for sure, that I could feel truly happy. I had left trying to escape the torturous environment of my aunt and uncle, and I knew I was headed to one place they would never, ever find me.

A colonial ship headed to the New World loaded with farm animals and supplies once drifted too far south, about 30 to 35 degrees north of the Equator. In this particular region of the ocean there is little if no Wind. A Ship caught in the windless environment would be stuck for weeks or possibly months without changing location. The Sailors used to refer to this phenomenon as ""the Doldrums"". After weeks had passed with no Wind, water reserves had begun to dwindle. The sailors decided to throw the Horses they had brought overboard to conserve water. The Horses were thrown off the ship but not without a fight, and when they hit the water, they tried desperately to swim back to the Ship. The Horses were terrified and made horrrific, shrill sounds similar to screaming. Eventually, the Horses drowned, but it had shaken the Sailors tremendously. Some of them who were superstitious saw the event as a bad omen. The dead carcasses of the Horses floated to the surface near the Ship and did not drift away. The stench of the rotting flesh was a constant reminder to the Sailors of the recent tragedy and of their hopeless situation. Some of the sailors went mad and were never seen again. Eventually, the Ship made it to safe harbor in the New World of America, but the Sailors who survived were forever changed. It is said that most of them had True Nightmares the rest of their days, hearing the screams of the drowning Horses and remembering the awful stench of the rotting horseflesh in the Doldrums.

The sunset cast a pink glow over the horizon. The last few rays stretched across the ocean, casting small shadows on the grains of sand like tendrils creeping from the water. The tendrils kept stretching and stretching as the light slowly faded from view. A man sat on the beach, these tendrils slowly sneaking towards him. His foot shifted, breaking the illusion as he leaned back. The sand softly clinked against the bottle of wine to his right and scraped against the pistol to his left. 

The mans name was unimportant. He was easily forgettable. He could blend into a crowd, disappear into the night. He was the guy in the apartment building, in 8B, who you pass every day. Who stares longingly at you as you walk buy but as far as you'd be concerned he's just a part of the tacky wallpaper. But he's always there whether you realize it or not. 

This feature of his was excellent in this case. Sitting on a beach in Florida, he was unnoticed by the countless runners and late tourists watching a sunset on a clear summer evening. As the last few stragglers went back to their homes and hotels, the man sat up straight. He grasped the bottle of wine, letting a few mouthfuls of the drink slide down his throat before wiping the bottle down and tossing it into the bushes. 

He stood up, the sand filling the void between his toes, as he slowly walked to the pier. Sitting out of view behind a support beam he waited. There was now no light in the sky. The faint glow of the city behind him made the waves visible but if anything was out there it was lost in the inky blackness. But a faint dot could be made on the horizon, a tiny light that could be easily mistaken as a star low on the horizon but the man knew better. He had dealt with this light before.

As the light slid across water, he followed. Walking down the beach and wading through water, all the while making sure the pistol was kept dry. He followed it for what felt like hours, his heartbeat pounding in his ears and his mind filled with anticipation. Eventually it came towards land, near a marina. Hiding behind a pillar once again, the man made sure the gun was loaded and the safety off. The boat grew near, the lights now completely on instead of hiding in the background. 

Another man, a Cuban, jumped off the boat, mooring her to the pier and made sure the locks were all locked tight. As he turned to leave he was faced by a man with a cocked pistol pointed squarely at his head. The Cuban could almost see the hollowpoint 9mm round lurking in the barrel. He closed his eyes. A loud pop was heard, birds scattered, and you could hear a thud as his body slumped to the wooden deck. The man quietly slipped away into the night, the black enveloping him.

The police arrived a few hours later, shooing the critters away trying to feast on the Cuban. They checked his pockets, retrieving the keys to his boat and climbed aboard. They found a hollow compartment and using the keys, popped the lock. Inside it was filled with water, they were about to close it when a hand slowly rose to the surface. 

After digging through the Cubans information they realized he went by a name that was respected out of fear in the Cuban community. The Coyote. A man who profited off the love of others by smuggling people out of Cuba and into the United States. They identified the remains, 12 in all, in the compartment and looked up their relatives. A stack of files with photos attached sat on a detectives desk as he worked through them. Considering their motive and wondering if they were the man that killed the Coyote. 

However in that stack of files was a man. A man who had lost his family to the Coyote. A man who had killed the Coyote. A man who blended into the background, slipping out of reality and disappearing once again into the dark. And as the file was eventually placed into the cold cases, waiting for a solution that would never come, the Man sat smiling on a chair in his small apartment. A man who raised his gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_18jeig,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/18jeig/a_man/,

This is a true story (I think) that I was told by my camp counselor when I was 10. I forget some of the minor details, but this is pretty much what happened. I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but I hope you enjoy it anyway!

A few years ago, he and a friend rented their professor's house over the summer, since he was going away for a month. It was nice place, and they got to enjoy each other's company. However, almost every night, they would hear banging and weird noises coming from the basement. When they went down in the morning, there was nothing there. They decided that it was probably an animal, so they decided to leave out a trap to capture whatever was in the basement at night. The next morning, they went downstairs to find a large bobcat growling (I think they growl) and hissing in the cage. He was about to call animal control to take it away, when the friend had the idea to bring it themselves outside to save animal control some trouble. However, the cage was far to bulky and heavy to carry it outside while unfolded and containing a bobcat. Without any real equipment, they decided to take one of their suitcases and put it open next to the door of the cage. He opened the door while his friend scared it away from the back of the cage. It dashed to freedom, but quickly came in contact with the suitcase. He slammed it shut, trapping the bobcat inside. Now, it was much easier to carry. They both loaded the suitcase into their truck and started driving toward the nearby forest area (they lived in Maine). They pulled onto the side of the road, set the suitcase on the ground, unzipped it about halfway, and climbed up a nearby tree so the bobcat wouldn't attack them when it got out. They waited, but it never came out. They were too scared to come down, in case it came out, and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, after about 10 minutes, a minivan pulled up next to their car. Someone got out, looked around (they didn't see my counselor and his friend in the tree), grabbed the suitcase, and got back in the van, which drove away. They instantly knew that something bad was about to happen, so they climbed back down the tree, got in their car, and sped off after the van. However, the van must have been going fast, because they couldn't see the van at all. About 2 miles after that, they started to enter farmland, with tall cornstalks bordering the road on each side. Suddenly, they saw tire skid-marks on the road, and a section of corn flattened, by what looked like a car. They stopped the car, got out, and ran to the flattened corn. About a hundred yards in, they saw the minivan stopped and the doors opened. As they got closer, they saw that nobody was inside, and there was blood on one of the seats. They never figured out what happened to the people in the van or the bobcat.

How long it had been. How long I had missed him and how much I loved him even though I'd never tell him that. I thought about the times when he would teach me about girls and I'd laugh when he would tell me stories about his friends. He was so cool back then through those rose colored glasses.

The drive was long. I remember the cold air as I inhaled, the snow on my windshield that I had lazily barely scraped off, the sputter of a failing engine and radio that was on way to loud to keep me awake while I downed energy drink after energy drink. I couldn't wait to see him. It had been a few months since I left town and we had lost contact. We were never the type to talk all that often. It was hard to ever get close to him because of his attitude for life and the problems he had coping with the fact dad wasn't with us anymore.

When I finally pulled into the driveway I noticed the house looked more run down then usual, never mattered to me much though. None of the lights were on and the door was locked which was unusual but I remembered the key we hid in the garage. It was nice to be back in a familiar place, however broken it was.

As soon as I walked in I saw him passed out on the couch. One arm was hanging off, the ash tray was full, he still had his boots on, everything was dirty and the place smelled like hell. Must've been a long day for him. I didn't bother waking him up. I saw the wrappings on his arm. It ran the length of his forearm until it stopped just below his elbow. Just thought was he had gotten that sleeve he had always talked about, the one to commemorate dad. Then I noticed the wristband from the hospital. I sighed then looked around the house and I noticed a pile of mail on the table, the broken mirror shards leaving the bathroom, the half bottle of Jack Daniels in the kitchen next to the microwave with the door still open and cold Ramen still in there, the bottle of painkillers on its side, the contents scattered across the counter. 
 
I layed back on the recliner. I tried to relax. I figured I'd let him sleep and have a little bit of it myself. When I opened my eyes I realized it was morning and thats when I got a better look at him. I couldn't describe how numb I had felt coupled with how much guilt I felt and that incredible sinking feeling I had in my chest when I noticed that this wasn't just him going down hill like last time. This was the last time.

""Happy birthday big bro."" I said as I kissed him on the forehead and sat next to him in silence in that horrid place.

While the statement is true I though it was far too cold and impersonal for a suicide note. I ripped the top sheet of paper from my moleskin notepad and threw it in the trash. A few minutes ago I took some of anti-depressants, Google said ten would be enough, I took 15 to be sure. According to a forum post by *suicidegurl87*  I should begin to slowly drift off into the good sleep an hour or so after ingesting the pills. The drugs are a backup anyway, a revolver lies on the desk with a single bullet pointing skywards beside it. At midnight I will shot myself, it's eleven fifteen now. 

I have always taken comfort in the knowledge that I could end my life if I so pleased. The ultimate power one can have over oneself, and the only power I still have. Now the time has finally come, and my feelings have not changed. Eleven thirty. A slight feeling of nausea is beginning to take hold, but I don't think I've ever felt happier. No fears, no worries, no insecurity. Peace. I take a sip of from a heavy glass tumbler, it's weight feels good in the hand, and savor the rich aroma of whiskey. My senses energize, the far off sound of a glass smashing reverberates through my ears, the smell of curry wafts in from the apartment bellow, the garish flowers on the wallpaper now vivid almost moving. Closer to death, closer to life. Eleven forty five.

I scribble out a short suicide note. There's no time for a heartfelt explanation now. I couldn't justify myself anyway, even I don't know precisely why I choose this path all I know is there are no other roads left to tread. They'll have to make do with a simple apology, besides it's not for them that I'm doing this. Eleven fifty five. The time has come, I spin the barrel , and position the bullet in the chamber. Close it with a satisfying click, the starting gun for the end of my life. I raise the revolver to my temple and cock the gun with clammy hands. Eleven fifty nine. The phone rings, too late now, I pull the trigger.

I lit a cigarette and took a quick harsh drag. My friend sat next me, quiet. He wouldn’t admit his thoughts, but I could see them on his face. I sat with the cigarette between fingers, slowly burning down, quickly giving me a buzz, relieving my stress. He was waiting for a text. I was waiting for anything. That night I wore shorts and a sweater: comfortably chilled. I can’t remember, but it is possible that we had been drinking.

From the vantage point of my friend’s porch we could see them approach her building and stand just outside her door. She was anxious. He, as always, was calm and cool.

I turned to my friend, “Do you see this?” I took a drag, eager for what happened next.

They stood there. Talking. His jeans loose, hems on the concrete, striped hoody, and backwards flat-billed baseball cap, all synonymous with his profile. She wore a skirt, netted leggings underneath, large boots coming half way up her calf, a low cut shirt and a half buttoned up purple cardigan sweater, her sunset red hair kept neat under a black beret. These two friends stood talking in the dark of night; thinking that they were alone in this moment. That for a few minutes the world was theirs. I watched on, ignorant to my friend’s presence and text chimes. In my mind I saw and heard their conversation. She was thanking him for being a good guy to walk her home. He said it was nothing and that he was happy to do it; “No problem.” One of them checked their phone, probably he did. He motioned to go. She asked him to wait. She stepped in for a hug and embraced him. He wasn’t reluctant, he didn’t stop to think about the implications, and he did not consider his girlfriend hundreds of miles away. He didn’t think about how much his girlfriend meant to him, and he didn’t consider how much this girl holding him right now wanted to be more than friends. He held her tight in his arms. And he released first. She held a second longer, understanding that now, given the circumstances, and his obligations, that he could not be with her. She turned to unlock her door; she pulled it open and stood there, holding it. One hand on the door, the other hanging at her side. They said goodbye, he turned and walked away. But she didn’t turn in. She stood there.

I was fixated on her. I wanted to walk over to her and tell her I’m sorry it wouldn’t work out with him. I wanted to run after him and tell him what he’s doing to her. But I couldn’t. I watched her. This image is cast in my mind like stone. The yellow lights on the wall above her emitting their soft enveloping glow. The way she held most of her weight on one foot. Her head cocked slightly to one side and inclined towards his fleeting presence. And my friend reclined on next to me. Cigarette smoke drifting before my face in the breeze.

To me this moment only lasted about fifteen seconds. She watched after him. I saw in her body language how she registered the ramifications of their conversation and interactions. Her body slouched. Her hand fell off the door letting it swing in, stopping against her shoulder. She loosened her firm stance and stepped one foot back to turn, but she couldn’t yet. She had to watch him a few seconds longer; she had to hope that he’d changed; that maybe he did feel the same way for her. Hoped that maybe he’d turn back for her. I could only imagine how long this felt for her, the emotions she felt as he went farther away, without looking back: the impact of his words tonight, the realizations within that hug, the disappointment and despondency of that brief moment. She finally turned in—sad, lonely, defeated. I felt sorry for her. I felt guilty that I had intruded on this moment; that I watched something that was supposed to be private and within only her world.

I finished my cigarette, crushed the butt, and threw it away.

Some things were added for entertainment purposes but the story is pretty much all there.

**Fight at the taco truck, as I remember it.**


It was the beginning of winter. Testosterone ran high, beards were long. Common folk refer to this phenomenon as 'no shave November' I call it a regular Wednesday. It was a large group of us this particular night. Mauri, Mikey, Eric, 'Other' Mikey, voluptuous Rosie, and of course yours truly. We started the night on the slums of Sunset. A dirty one block radius crawling with the worst type of people besides hipsters, more hipsters. If it wasn't for the Wednesday's specials and surplus of sluts, this place would be nothing less than an arcade fire concert screening Wes Anderson films. We loaded up on the cheap booze, and stuck around for the slutty ambiance.
     

As our uneventful night came to an end we decided to meet at Gus' infamous taco truck. We rode in two separate cars, or as the urban kids say 'we was rolling deep' Mauri, Eric and Mikey took the quick route and stopped at our local liquor for a twelve pack of our favorite brand. I ended up driving 'other Mike's' car because to be honest the kid couldn't handle his liquor. This also gave me a chance to gauge the possibility of sex with Rosie. Sex seemed pretty probable, but then again it always does. I would catch her staring at me while I drove. I couldn't tell if she was admiring my ability to drink out of my flask while keeping an eye on the road or my disregard for danger, all I knew is that she was amazed and probably aroused. I decided to take the scenic route.

    

Call it a hunch, or perhaps supernatural abilities, but as soon as I pulled into the parking lot I could sense trouble. I quickly and skillfuly parked the small jalopy and leaped out. ""Where are you going!"" Rosie yelled. I didn't have time to answer, shit was going down and I was going to help it. I ran towards the kerfuffle around Mikey's car and made it there just in time to see a tall, skinny, awkward looking man taking a swing at my good friend Mauri. I didn't need an explanation or reason to start handing out cans, that was plenty. I dove into the group of people fist first until I reached that tall awkward face. His acne infested skin felt soft against my rugged knuckles. It was a little too late to realize 'Awkward Skinny' had friends. Things went dark for a bit after this.


     

As I came to my senses, I glimpsed around to assess the situation. Things weren't looking good, but they weren't looking bad either. Eric landed some quick jabs that sounded like double bass pedals from a metal band, he had chosen his guy and he was going to take him out. Phony Mike was being gay in the car comforting Rosie. Mauri stood quietly studying the scene and Mikey was walking over to assist me when some random Joe appeared out of nowhere with a handful of fists for both of us. Now this 'Random Joe' did not know Mauri. He did not know that Mauri had been pretty peaceful this whole time, watching these events unfold. He did not know the rage that hid behind him. He did not know that Mauri is a cool guy, a regular mother fucking Teresa but if you fuck with his friends... well then he will fuck you up.
     



Mauri's shirt came off and his drunken stance became firm. With his fist up in the air he went around taking names and handing out prizes. 'Random Joe' and 'Awkward Skinny' turned their attention to the one taking out their friends and surrounded him. Rosie and 'Imposter Mike' came out to try to instill some peaceful sense into us. I watched helplessly as Mauri was surrounded by seven guys and a midget. (You know gangs mean bussiness when the 'gang midget' is called out for a fight.) To my surprise, Mauri's confidence looked to be intact, he looked over at me and gave me his 'ok' wink. I nodded back. I understood.

     


'Random Joe' jumped on top of 'Gang Midget' and began swinging his arms. Gang midget struggled to keep his balance but managed to charge towards Mauri. As Mauri mouthed out ""What the fuck?!' he took a quick dive to dodge this 'one and a half man turbine'. The midget couldn't control his direction and ran right into a wall. 'Awkward skinny' bursted out in a maniacal laugh and pointed at Mauri, his five remaning henchmen rushed Mauri on the floor. They covered him entirely with punches and grunts, if I didn't know any better, it looked like a japanese gangbang without pixels. I looked at Eric and Mikey and we all nodded in agreement, we had to get in. But just as we decided to join the fun, Mauri burst from within sending all five of them to the floor. Shirtless Mauri stood up and pointed at 'Awkward skinny' 
     

""You!"" He began, 
     

""You wanted a fucking beer, we gave you a fucking beer!"" 
     

The fab five quickly recovered and tried their luck again. Awkward skinny kept laughing. Something was clearly wrong with him.
     

The five fucks took their swings and kicks, but these were no match for Mauri's quick turns and ducks. He was salsa dancing around the punches, it was a beautiful sight. Eventually, they stopped their futile attempts to touch Mauri. 
     

""Is that all you got?!"" Mauri teased. 
     

The winded five farts had nothing. It was Mauri's turn. To say he knocked them out fast is an understatement. He walked through them making them taste his friendship fury. He made his way towards that tall awkward skinny fuckhead that had started it all.
      

It was pretty clear this was Mauri's fight, but before he started unloading, Awkward skinny crumbled down to his knees and begged for mercy. Not even Ghandi would have listened to that prick, but Mauri swallowed what was left of his pride and turned away. The crowd that had gathered cheered and chanted his name. He walked taller than before and began making his way back to the car. Just then, 'Awkward skinny' pulled out a full bottle of newcastle and pitched it towards an unaware Mauri. We all looked in shock,and questioned ""How the fuck does someone hide a full bottle through an entire fight?!"" but we quickly realized he hadn't participated for most of it. We tried to yell out to mauri but our expressions warned him faster and he majestically turned around to quickly catch the bottle. He promptly opened it up and chugged it like a legend in the making. Alex, who had not been part of this whole night, just happened to be getting himself some tacos, he witnessed this last unjustice and ran towards awkward skinny to launch his frail ass towards a car. ""No one throws out a full Newcastle"" Alex sighed.
     


Mauri and Alex joined us back by the car to finish our brew. I could tell Rosie had lost all interest in me and was going to spend the night with Mauri but I wasn't even mad, because after that fight, he deserved a good fucking.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1683p6,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1683p6/fight_at_the_taco_truck_as_i_remember_it/,

Together, the pair enter the building in the garden. Inside, a woman is alone save for the two newcomers. She drops a quarter into a tin box on the wall. The sound of the coin hitting the metal echoes through the cavernous stone room as she lights one of a row of little white candles.

The two who enter the building make no sound, save for the child's muffled cough and sniffles. The child wants to go to the woman, but the man holds the child's shoulder. The child looks up at the man, who places a finger on his lips, shushing. The child understands, and nods before quietly walking over. The woman is crying. The child kneels next to her on the little padded bench in front of the candles. 

After a time, the woman gets up and leaves the room. The child goes back to the man, takes his hand, and the two go outside again. They watch from the door of the building as the woman goes up to one of the little statues in the yard. She stands there, and the child leads the man over. As they approach, the woman leaves. The child cries out, waving to the woman. The man shushes him, but not before the woman turns around.

The man braces as though preparing for something terrible, but nothing happens. The woman looks back at where they stand, blankly. The child runs forward a few steps and waves to the woman. She continues looking-- looking, but without seeing-- for a brief moment, then turns again and leaves. Once the woman is gone, the child returns to the man's side.

The strange pair looks down at the statue of an angel embracing a tablet. On the tablet is an inscription. The child cannot read it, and asks what it says. The man reads it. The child is confused. Why would someone write that on a statue?

""Sometimes people write things on stones when they want to remember them for a long time.""

The child doesn't have a response. They look at the statue for a bit.

""You're not coughing anymore,"" the man notes.

""Huh?""

""Your cough is gone."" The man says to the child. ""Are you feeling better now?""

The child pauses, and realizes the man is correct. He is pleasantly surprised.

""Yes."" The child smiles.

The man returns the smile.

""Yes, I am, actually. Does this mean I can go back?"" The child points back the way the woman went.

The man's smile turns sad. ""No one can go back. But what it means is that you can go on.""

The child frowns. ""Do I have to? I mean, would you?""

""I would."" The man doesn't hesitate a moment.

""Why don't you?""

""I can't.""

""Oh."" The child puzzles a moment. ""Is it because you aren't better yet?""

The man smiles again. ""Something like that.""

The child thinks a moment more. ""I think I want to go. Are you sure you can't come?""

""Sorry, not today.""

How did a reflection follow your actions so perfectly? Were they really reflections, or were they people stuck behind the mirror? And most of all… What did they do when nobody was looking?
And so it came about that he tried to beat the mirror. Experimenting with the massive slab of glass opposite his bed… Moving quickly, and slowly, and subtly… even blocking his image with furniture, and popping up completely randomly…
But none of it worked. The mirror always knew what he was doing, and when. One day, he just gave up. He closed his eyes and leant back until he was lying flat on the bed. Maybe it was impossible to beat the mirror. Maybe the people were just reflected light. Maybe-
Something jerked him out of his musings. He sat bolt upright and opened his eyes. There was his reflection, in the mirror. There was everything, as it should be. What was wrong? What was-
And then he saw it. He, of course, was sitting upright, every muscle tensed. His reflection was reclining, leaning back. In slow motion, he saw the realisation on the reflection’s face, and then it tried to subtly shift into John’s position.
He moved quickly – he stood up like a flash, and the reflection was slow. He darted out to the side, and it was just half a second behind. He ran out of the room for a reason he didn’t quite understand even at the time, and it didn’t try to copy him, but stood and watched.
When he came back, all was normal. The reflection copied him as vigilantly as ever, and he wasn’t in the mood to try tricking it again. Besides, he thought it might be wise to that a second time.
But that night, as he was sleeping, he suddenly awoke, and he instantly knew that it was the mirror.
‘It’s okay,’ he said. ‘You can come out.’
Little did he know that he had broken a curse. A curse placed oh so long ago to keep the reflections in check. To lock them in mirrors forevermore.
By the time John heard footsteps, the reflection’s eyes were glowing with a light that was black, and its fingers were pointed claws. By the time he knew anything was happening, fingers were wrapped around his neck in an iron grip, and soon he was dead.
One is enough. Because one demon that escapes into the physical world can masquerade as a person. And then, they can convince people to let their reflections out.
And a final thought. If Hell is a world with demons, then what will this world be when there are no humans, and only reflections?",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_161fcm,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/161fcm/mirror/,

""Underground""",TyrannyMcbane,7,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/15lgof/dont_know_where_im_going_with_this_underground/,"When the sun came out, we hid. We did not fear the light; we feared the unexpected. In the dark it was unsafe to even breath. You walk down the road and are likely to get stabbed and searched by the hungry. The young, the old, the thugs, the respectable- we were all hungry, and whether you looked like you had anything on you or not you were going to be gutted sooner or later. This was our world now and though it may sound insane we adapted to it. Even learned how to enjoy life. Because it was so predicable. But daytime, brightness, that was a mystery. It was better to hide in sewers amongst the filth than go out in the brightness. I heard stories, never saw it for myself.... until Kara came.

My baby. My sweet, sweet baby girl. Seventeen year old ragged bones make for a piss poor mother but there was no stopping her when she chose to come. For a few weeks after she was born the old man took care of us, but just like everyone else he had to watch out for himself so we were on our own soon enough. I could breastfeed her but only if I ate myself. I spent so much time trying to care for her I wasn't able to make ends meet in my usual way- the way that had brought me her. It was desperation that brought me to the brightness.

Once Upon A Time... that's how all my mother's stories begun. Once Upon A Time, it was safe to go out into the light, when the real sun shone down so the soil was bountiful and the cities fresh. Once Upon A Time there was a gorgeous ball of fire in the sky that nourished us, something natural, not the man-made sky of bulbs that you know now. Once Upon A Time there were many governments, not just one, and they were here to protect us.

Those were the more ludicrous stories, the one's I knew better than to believe. I grew up with the Global Democracy, with the Roof of Lights, with the stale air and rampant disease and inherent despair that made this place a home. In her dying breaths my mother begged me to have faith and I denied her. I should feel guilt; I do not. I only feel hunger. 

Above ground, the city was a rank place. I knew it only by night, and it was much different then. The streets never changed but those who inhabit it did. No police walked the night. Homes were locked and usually even had bars over the doors and windows. There was absolutely no light that you didn't create yourself; the sky was pitch black and the city did not provide streetlights. Makeshift garbage fires and lanterns were the norm, casting shadows that twisted and tricked. By day, I was to learn, things were very different.

There was no filth in the streets, and the air was clean. Everything you saw was spotlessly clean and manicured. Yet the air was vile no matter where you went, as if it had been breathed in and out a thousand times. How it managed to supply us with oxygen was a miracle. The sky never changed. I was white, made up of an infinite amount of light bulbs and hung thousands of feet above us. Supposedly the Roof of Lights encase the entire orb of the earth, and I often wonder what held it up. Buildings were all gray cement, except the homes, which everyone knew were mostly for show. Those were nearly all identical versions of a square, stout building of brownish bricks and white wooden doors. A fifteen by ten rectangle of grass that never grew sat in front of each one and various vehicles stood in each driveway, though only very important people drove. By day the metals bars that covered the doors and windows at night were not to be seen. This was all very new to me.

I emerged from a sewer grate in the early morning, when the police were just beginning to do patrols. Coming out any later would probably result in death- us from underground were not supposed to exist. The police were obviously not human folk, not like us underground. They had face of smooth, unblemished beige, all the same, like they had been specifically bred to deny race. Brown eyes. Strict features. Very little individuality. I'd never heard of one speaking. I'd never heard that they even bledd or breathed, for that matter. I followed the signs along the roads to take me to the right one. Gardner Street. There was a market there. I hadn't yet put thought into how I would pay. I just knew that everyone said you could get food on Gardner street.

After two and a half hours of walking I began to wonder if Kara was okay, wrapped in my old sweater and hidden in a whole in the wall by the place we slept. That sounds like bad parenting. It's not. She was a thousand times safer there. No one had anything to gain from a baby. I arrived at the correct street and had to lean against a wall to contain my surprise. This was not a market. Not like the ones underground, at least. There were no stalls, no sellers, no rats cooking, no rotting fruit in moldy baskets.

It was a gray cement building like the others but with big planes of glass making up the front to reveal the inside. Aisles and aisles of shelving filled with colorful cans, bags, and baskets... fresh fruit, most unfamiliar to me, bread the was not burnt and cut into even slices, and meat! It was red and fresh and clean and I'd bet money that I didn't have that it wasn't from rats. Unbelievable.

I walked through the doors and instantly knew I didn't belong there. I didn't have Euro's. I smelled like the underground. If I tried to steal, I'd be executed, and my Kara would starve to death alone in a hole in the wall. Yet I couldn't leave. I wandered around the big building, taking in the delectable smells, trying to avoid the gaze of the clean workers in their uniforms. There wasn't anyone else in the place besides myself that didn't work there. Or so I thought, until I found myself in an aisle made up of closed closets made of glass that emitted a terrible cold. The boxes and bags inside had pictures of food inside and were obviously frozen.

He was tall. He was handsome. He had skin of smooth beige, but crystal blue eyes and a mole on his left cheek. He wore no uniform. The second he saw me, a sharp, wolfish grin cracked open his face and he strode over to me as if he owned the world.

“Your type doesn't belong here. Your type doesn't exist. So what, pray tell, are you doing here?”

Panic froze me to the spot. I knew in that moment I was going to die. But instead of pulling out the electronic needle all police carried, he threw back his head and laughed. It was a deep, rich laugh that startled me even more. Officers did not laugh!

“I'm just joking with ya, Tike. I know what you're doing. In all my twenty five years I don't think I've sen one of you with the balls for it though.” He looked me over closely, as if evaluating me for strengths and weaknesses that were under my skin. He nodded. “Aye, I can use ya. Nicely. Come on, we'll get food. Don't be scared, I've got money, I'm paying. Are you scrounging for just yourself?”

It took a few moments for me to realize he was offering to help me, and a few longer to unfreeze myself. This was absolutely wrong. He said he could “use” me. I wasn't no fresh hen; I'd been “used” many times over, knew what it entailed, knew how to handle it and even do it right to earn a morsel. Yet I didn't think he meant the same thing.

It's not like I had long to rationalize. My situation was crazy and I had no choice. He cocked and eyebrow and I nodded. I could only hope he meant to use what was under my skirt.

“So you're only getting what for yourself?” He asked like he knew the situation was otherwise. It didn't occur to me to lie.
“N-no. I have a baby. Two months. Feed her myself though” I blushed and was revlted by myself. He had not needed to know that.

“I thought so. Something had to spur you out the hole. Besides, breasts like those rarely come naturally” He grinned again and walked off as if I was expected to follow. My cheeks burned fiery red but I did. Where would this take me?

He led me down aisle and occasionally handed me something to carry, stopping once to get me a basket to accommodate the load. I was especially surprised when he handed me a package with a picture of a baby on it; diapers. Finally we came back to the front of the store and laid our loot out in front of an employee with an odd machine. She fiddled with it for a minute before telling my new friend his total.

“Three thousand, one-hundred seventy five.” I could have swooned. I thought for sure he'd put it all back and tell me I was on my own, but instead he took out a black card with a three gold bands around it and swiped it through the machine. His calm demeanor seem the frighten the girl, but she kept a calm face. Her blonde hair and pale skin soothed me; she was one of us, the humans, even if she did live in a different world.

Outside the building he took the bags from me. “You’ll get these, and a warm place to sleep tonight, on conditions. You're going to crawl back into the sewers, get your baby, and bring her here. You will both be staying with me for an indefinite amount of time. If you do not comply you'll likely both starve. Understood?”

I only nodded yes. By now the whole situation felt like a dream. I'd do whatever this angel said, until it all came crashing down and I died in the fire. It was no more dangerous than my life would be otherwise.

“Good. How long will it take you to get back here?”

This made me pause. “A few hours, but... I can't go in and out of the sewers in broad day. I'll be euthanize! And to take my baby above ground? Look, sir, I know you don't know nothing about-”

Suddenly he was very close to my face. “I know much more than you. You know nothing. There is a sewer grate five feet from here. I know that's how you people go up and down and I know someone your age has the underground fair memorized. You'll use that entrance. You'll bring her here. I'll wait no more than four hours, that's when business is off and the streets flood with more than police. You'll be safe. Go now.”

I had no choice but to obey. What would happen to me now? Had I endangered my baby? Of course I had. She deserved a better mother.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_15lgof,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/15lgof/dont_know_where_im_going_with_this_underground/,

a young man walks into a bedroom. it's dark, and there isn't much light in the room save a lone bulb, dangling from an old ceiling fan that probably should have been put out of use years ago. 

it's the kind of room with its own stairs, the kind that, if you got it, all your siblings are jealous for the entirety of your growing up together. it's a rectangular room, with a window at each short end. the ceilings are slanted in to follow the sharp angles of the roof directly overhead, and the wall paper is a smoke stained white from years of his great grandmother sitting up there reading her old shitty romance novels and chain smoking. 

he flicks the power switch of an old tube amp, just as stained as the walls. with a snap the tubes begin to warm, and he starts to tune his favorite guitar. after about a minute or two, with the G string still a little flat, he begins to play. he plays a few songs he knows, not in their entirety of course, just fragmented parts to a greater whole. a greater whole he feels he can never accomplish. as he plays what comes from the guitar starts to lose all clarity, all sense as he begins to think about her. deep in thought, he forgot what he was playing. 

his mother shouts up his stairs for dinner time, and it takes him a few moments to realize what's going on. he turns off his amp and joins his family for a quiet dinner. 

the next morning comes and goes as nothing but sleep dictates his schedule, besides his court ordered alcohol classes and the bi-weekly therapy sessions his mother put him in. he decided not to go to college, having just graduated high school, abandoning all hope after botching the placement exams, though his family doesn't know this. they simply think he's disgruntled, and will come around eventually, but he has kept private, his reasons. 

he wakes around one forty five in the afternoon, to a grumbling stomach, he ignores it. since he can't drive anymore he is void of any plans or anything to do, so he decides to walk to their spot about two miles from his house. their spot is the creek where as children he fell in love with her, the place they spent all their time together.

 they met at a young age no one can recall, and before the age of ten their parents were were putting on bets they'd get married. he missed talking to her. now 18 and alone, sitting in the woods, face blank overlooking the creek. glaring at the water that's shit brown from all the mud and pollutants, he looks around his spot.

 there are large rocks scattered about, all covered in moss. most are half submerged in the wide but shallow creek, but a select few are in what he considers awful places to put such a large rock. the trees are tall and thick, hundreds of years old. they're the only ones around save the few trees in people's yards, since the construction companies came in to build his development. but that was a long time ago.

 sitting in his old woods, he begins to think about her again. his eyes start to get that rubbery feeling, and his vision blurs. he sits in silence as tears roll down his face. an hour passes, or longer, he doesn't care or know how long he's been there. he raises himself up and carries himself home. when he gets to his house, he rushes straight up his stairs avoiding his siblings and father, ignoring his mother's question as to where he had been.

 it's four in the morning, and he's sweating. he decides to take a walk, and finds himself on his way to the only place he seems to go anymore besides his own house. his spot at the creek is down a small road that would probably be considered a country road if it were not for the multitude of single family homes jam packed down the street. he passes the sign for the state park, which some kids had spray painted a large cartoon penis onto. he kind of chuckles to himself, but as he reaches the turn his face sinks into a deep grimace. he hated how much time he spent at his spot, but he felt so guilty if he weren't there. when he reaches his spot, he begins to climb the tree he had when he were younger. the tree he always climbed with her. the tree that served at the catalyst for the breaking of his arm when he was eleven when she laughed until she saw the thin piece of bone sticking out of his arm with the stream of crimson dripping heavily from it. he sat in his tree and thought. thought about everything. thought about his family, thought about his few friends he didn't talk to anymore, thought about how much he missed her and how sorry he was for what he did. as he always did at his special place in the woods, whether it be on the banks of the creek or up in their tree, he cried.

 he asked himself why he thought he'd be alright that night. why he let himself do what he did. out of his backpack he took out a rope. it was a course rope one might think was made of sandpaper, but was really a thick twine for cattle or other. just a moment later, he was dangling by his neck from the thickest branch on the left bow of the tree.

 he couldn't help but stare at the spot she had died. he always found it ironic, the place they fell in love was the same place he had killed her. vehicular manslaughter the police report called it, along with DUI and reckless driving. maybe if she were wearing her seat belt he wouldn't have had to go through the agony of watching his only love get ejected through the windshield of his father's impala. when he climbed out of the car he ran to her. he ran to her like he had one thousand and one times before to the same spot they had played at as children. he found her laying face down on the shore. half of her was in the shallow water, with one leg bent up backwards past her head. the top of her skull was almost flattened, like a military man's flat top, only pushed down to where it wouldn't look humanly possible. to where it wouldn't be humanly possible save some sort of skull crushing event. he held her and cried for an hour. she was gone before he even got to her. she was probably gone after the fender of the impala was crushed from the impact of the moss covered rock jutting out next to the road.
 
with only a moment left of consciousness before his vision, then subsequently his life, faded to black, he realized he was making a mistake. he thought about his family again, only this time he wasn't so critical of his parents' scoldings or his siblings' arguments. he thought about the friends he wished he talked to more. and lastly, he thought about her. he wished he could have done better by her, but knew it was too little, too late. he wished he could have said goodbye, maybe get a little closure, but if that happened he wouldn't be where he is now. realizing he was a fuck up, he also realized it's not too late to change. only, with your neck in a noose and you're feet dangling 8 feet above the ground, change is difficult. groping for the rope to try to relieve his weight, he wasted more of his precious oxygen. as he became heavier and heavier, and as the rope cut more and more into his thin neck, he began to cry one last tear.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_157sra,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/157sra/wrote_this_a_year_and_a_half_ago_when_i_was/,

His feet on his desk, his papers scattered about, he inhaled the fresh nicotine and exhaled heavily.  There was a knock.  With a sigh, Richard unseated himself and sauntered over to the frosted glass door.

“It’s Mickey,” came the voice from the other side.  

Richard closed his eyes and took a deep breath, sucking in as much as he could before opening the door.

“We’ve got a new case,” Mickey explained.

“That so?”  

Mickey nodded.  “Morphine.”

Richard stared out the window to the streets of L.A., a trail of smoke rolling off his lips. “Again?” he asked, slightly frustrated.

“Again,” Mickey confirmed.  “Say, Richard, I thought we agreed you wouldn’t smoke in the office.  And I’d rather you didn’t at all, it’s really not a good habit.”

Richard turned to look at his partner of seven years.  His movements slow and methodical, he lifted the cigarette to his mouth once more, eyeing Mickey and blowing a stream of smoke up into the air.  After one last puff, he smothered the flame and disposed of the cigarette.  

“Thank you,” said Mickey.  Richard seated himself once more, leaning back and resting his size nine leather shoes on the cluttered desk.  Mickey cleared his throat.  “I have a few leads,” he stated.  Richard gave an inquisitive look.  “About the case,” he continued, “I believe I know who the supplier is.”  

Richard stood.  “Lead the way.”

Mickey stepped outside and into his Chevrolet Styleline, Richard following at a steady pace.  The car slowly accelerated, as Mickey was careful about his things, particularly his car.  They sat in silence, other than a single attempt by Mickey to initiate conversation.  Eventually, they arrived at a bar downtown.  Mickey led the way inside.

The bar was filled with cigar smoke, and Richard took this as an invitation to light up one of his own.  Mickey dared not say a word, and ignored his partner’s actions as he sauntered over to a table occupied by three men.  He sat down, leaving Richard to stand, as there were only four seats.

Richard swore he had seen the man in the middle before.  The pale, round face and striking blue eyes screamed of familiarity, but Richard failed to determine from where.  Mickey initiated conversation.

“How’ve you been, Ballard?”

The man across from Mickey gestured towards Richard.  “Who’s this,” he asked in strong a Bostonian accent.

“This,” replied Mickey, “is my partner Richard.” Richard’s brow furrowed.

“I don’t like him.”

Mickey turned to Richard, a pleading look in his eyes.  “Could you wait out in the car?  I’ll be ten minutes or less.”  Richard looked at the two man and left the room without acknowledging either man.  Minutes later, Mickey emerged.

“Sorry about that,” he apologized.  “Tom is… uncomfortable around strangers.”

“What I’m more concerned about is why you don’t fall under that category.”

They drove in silence until arriving back at the office.  “Don’t wait for me,” Richard instructed. “I’m in no mood to go home to my wife.”

“That’s not a good attitude to have.”

“Don’t lecture me, Michael.”

Once inside, Richard sat down at his desk and closed his eyes.  He enjoyed being in the office, it being the calmest place he knew, but was only able to grasp a moment of respite before being interrupted by the ringing of the telephone.  With a sigh, he answered it.  A woman’s voice on the other end went into details about a case.  

“Hold on,” said Richard, “I need a pen.” 

Richard set the phone down and opened a drawer.  He fiddled with papers, but found nothing, so he reached over to Mickey’s filing cabinet.  

It was the first time Richard had ever looked into Mickey’s filing cabinet, which was always kept locked.  Fortunately for Richard, the key had been left sitting directly on top of it.  Opening the top drawer, Richard peered inside.

“Son of a bitch,” Richard muttered to himself under his breath, as inside, bound together with a rubber band, labeled “T.B.,” was nothing but a three inch high pile of cash.  He leafed through it… all twenties.  Richard closed the drawer and went back to the phone.

“I’m going to have to call you back.”

Before the woman could protest, Richard hung up the phone and dialed his partner’s number.

----------

The night was quiet as the clock struck ten.  Far from downtown Los Angeles, Richard Hale stood, waiting.  A car passed, then another.  Neither was the one he was waiting to see.  Thunder rumbled in the distance, yet not a drop of rain had fallen.  He slid his hands into his coat pockets, feeling the items within.  The smooth paper in the left, the cold metal in the right.

Richard heard another car and looked up. A maroon Styleline rolled to a stop in front of him.  Out stepped a man.

“What’s so urgent?”

Richard drew his left hand from his pocket, revealing the stack of bills.  

“Where the hell did you get that?” 

“I should be asking you the same thing.”

Richard watched as the man’s face twisted.  He motioned for Richard to approach him.  Richard obliged, and watched as the trunk of the car opened.  He glanced inside, then back at the man before him.

“You know,” the man said.  “I can get you in on this.”

Richard glared.  “I thought… I thought you were better than this.”

The man’s face twisted into a wicked grin, a grin far different from the one Richard had known for so long.  “Every man has his price,” he said, grinning at the ground as rain began to fall.  He looked up.  “What’s yours?”

Richard pulled his right hand out of his coat, the object within in his grasp.  The man’s smile disappeared, his eyes widened.

“No… Richard, please, no.”

Richard shook his head in disgust.  “You were a good partner.”

The streetlights cast a shadow on the streets of LA.  As the rain poured, a figure in a trench coat walked off into the distance, alone.

Richard Hale lifted a fresh cigarette to his mouth.

Begin Short Story:
   

    The Heart of Man, Alone 


There is a silence in the air, cold and dark, as the lone Space Cruiser slips through the dead of eternal night.  It weaves itself in and out of any string of celestial obstructions, carefully making its way towards its final destination.  Shooting into the abyss, random assortments of stars dance around in an awe inspiring scene of phantasmagoria.  If one were to see it now, soaring through the sky, it would seem motionless, with nothing in the backdrop to signify any sort of movement, only blackness.

Then, the calm is broken.  It is a low, deep hissing noise at first.  Gradually, it becomes a repetition of high, rhythmic clicking sounds. Then silence returns.  Minutes, even hours seem to pass as the ship remains in a silent darkness. At last, a sharp panging sound breaks the silence, like the ringing reverberation of a church bell in the early mists of a Sunday morning.  A final latch comes loose, and the door of the cryogenic pod is allowed to break free from the steady grip of its fastener. The lights of the ship slowly flicker on, seeming to activate in order to display the fragile contents buried within the pod.  And then, awake.      

Bright, everything is so bright and glowing with an intense white luminescence.  My eyes are so unaccustomed to this radiant stimulation.  I soon forget of my visual pain, though, when I find myself gasping for air.  I feel as though the air is too thick for my porous lungs, and with each new gasp my chest becomes more weighted and heavy.  My throat is clogged with a dense, warm film.  I force my heavy body out of the pod, but no sooner than I do, I find myself on the ground, limp.  The muscles in my legs feel so tired, as if drained of all life supporting energy.  I look up, dazed and confused, still battling to gain every breath.  I frantically look about the small, faded cabin for water, or anything, to clear my respiratory obstruction.  All around me, the dim lights continue to flicker on, pulsating around me in an irritated, sporadic flurry.  More frantic now, I reach out to grasp a thin cord hanging off of an ostensibly promising counter top.  Small bodies begin to shower all around me, hitting my head and shoulders. In my desperation, I do not even feel the hard thudding against my skull. 

A single light fixes now, spotlighting all the treasures that fell from above. The lone light shines, with all the rest continuing with their intense strobe.  With new vision, I am able to see a little glass vial filled with a mysterious black liquid.  I grab for it in desperation, and let the quick, cool liquid slide down the back of my throat.  As I continue to drink, not only do I find my choking obstruction wearing away, but also a strange sensation of pulsating energy all throughout my body.  My weak, zombie-like state is lifted, as I bring myself to my feet.  All the lights go off--but just for a moment--then return with a steady, illuminating brightness.  With my new empowerment, I also feel that the black cloud enshrouding my mind has lifted.  I am able to begin accessing my situation.  As I look around me, I see a white haven bathed in a sheet of artificial white light.  Smooth, white metal floors and walls, white counters and white space suits surround me.  A tall panel of buttons framed in a large white containment lies on the wall immediately to the left of me.  Completely regaining my senses now, I begin to remember.  I remember a place other than this, with colors other than this bleak, consuming white.  If I looked up ward, a vast pool of blue would engulf all my vision.  You could feel a smooth breeze against your skin, not just the cool, stagnant air contained in this small room.  This ship.  And there were others, too.  Other people like me, laughing, singing, running, playing.  And then I remember. The others!

I turn my attention over to the large metal pod from which I had emerged.  I touch the cool metal casing, and run my hands along the soft, cushioned interior where my lifeless body had spent the last 150 years.  For a moment, I let my thoughts run to my previous life, the one before I had been chosen for The Mission.  I suppress my pang of nostalgia, and allow myself to move on.  I then read the small control screen on the outside covering of my pod.  ""Thawing Successful,"" it reads.  I found it bizarre that I was alone.  Why had my two comrades not been unthawed by now, just as I had?  All of our pods had been programmed to open exactly seven days before our landing on the planet, and we had been given strict instructions on how to use this time for the preparation of that.  I ease myself, explaining that our times had merely been elapsed slightly for energy purposes.  Energy was their biggest concern; I remember that from the ship's modeling. When they had done it, all the world was ecstatic.  The first trip beyond our solar system was no longer merely a topic of high school sci-fi fantasy, but a reality.  A reality that I am now living. 

Bringing myself back to the present, I turn my tall, thin body towards the two other pods situated neatly next to mine.  I read the screen on the first pod.  No, that can't be right.  I rub my eyes roughly, as if trying to remove the painful sheet of reality from my vision.  I read it again.  ""Error,"" it says.  I begin to toy with the buttons on the keypad.  Calmly at first, but I soon find myself becoming more and more frantic.  I turn towards the next pod, which has the same reading as the first.  I am at a loss of what to do, but feel that I must do something.  I grab a long, metal pole at the other end of the room, accidentally smashing one of the ships lights as I do so.  It becomes dim and dreary.  Using my weapon, I begin to forcibly pry open the thick, heavy metal door of the first pod.  I feel no struggle or pain, only the pulsating kick of adrenaline coursing through my blood.  I dent the latch keeping the door in place.  Success.  I am able to pry the door open now, and am surprised at what I feel.  There is no thick, rolling of cool compressed Nitrogen coming from out of the pod.  No, only the sticky, consuming smell of a rotting carcass.  I begin to wheeze, and my eyes feel as though they begin to bleed.  The morbid scene horrifies me.  The pod had been tightly sealed, but had never gone to the protective cooling stage of suspended animation.  My comrade's body had merely been left to collect a heavy cloud of thick human decay within the pod.  I cover my nose and eyes with my shirt sleeve, trying to save myself from the putrid odor.  I run into the next room, filled with emotions of horror, grief, and anger.  I find myself in the control station.  I frantically grab for the speaker, and project my voice desperately through the millions of miles of heavenly void.  ""Earth!  Please, please come in.  Earth!""  There is no response, and I find myself desperately sobbing now.  I continue to call out, but all in vein.  ""Please, this is station P461, reporting from the intergalactic mission.  There is a major problem here, I repeat, a major problem. Hello!?  God dammit, answer me!"" 

And then, silence.  I slide back into the large, engulfing cushions of the captain's chair.  I cannot cry; I don't have the energy anymore.  My frenzy left me with a feeling of overwhelming exhaustion.  I just sit in a sullen daydream.  I am alone now, completely alone.  All that I had left behind has frittered away. I have been left in ravages. 

I was on a mission.  I had chosen to leave my life behind, to pursue glory and honor.  It was a choice I had made, and a choice I have to make again.  I gaze out of the ship's lone window, the only thing connecting me to the outside.  I stop for a minute.  The only thing I see is blackness.  The deep, sort of concentrated blackness that one experiences only when gripped strongly by the darkest clutches of slumber.

It's a 3 hour flight from New York to Chicago and beaming through the thin haze - how many feet below us? 20,000? 30,000? - lies god's ice tray.

Neatly separated by the fences of past disputes and lawsuits yet to be settled, last night's snowfall purposefully shimmers in random and infinite directions.

Naturally vying for the attention of the other passengers - a standard fair of middle aged business travellers, pretend writers and holiday makers - the world outside cannot compete with the opportunity of a guilt free break from the kids. Or with the - soon to be discarded forever - typing. Or even with the Adam Sandler movie being shown for the 50th first time. Most of the shades are down.

As we chase the sun, stalling its escape behind the horizon, I see another plane frozen in the sky slightly ahead of us, beating us, indifferently flaunting the majesty of the parallel streams in its trail.

Like a yawning peacock, fanning its tail at cooing tourists, it casually gives permission to stare at how effortless it is to be graceful and humble and beautiful.

""Why don't you be beautiful too? Can't you see how easy I make it look?


Now eat my dust.""

This is not a race.

There are no television cameras or radio commentators or photographers secretly hoping for a career making collision. No one is cheering along for victory.

Well....

Not on my flight anyway.

But I reckon that's because we're losing.

Park lights illuminate the Willamette with their reflection off the dark surface of the water. The metal beams of the bridge flash in a green blur as the bus pushes its way toward the university campus. The time is 9:04 pm as I get off the bus which means I have some time to walk around before my shift begins at 9:30. I work at a cafeteria on the university’s campus washing dishes as a way to make some extra money.
I walk through campus, passing buildings I see every day, in the silent, cold night. The lampposts littering campus and the music coming through my earphones are the nearest thing to company I have. Looking down the long stretch of vacant asphalt, I feel lonely in this empty environment of concrete and bricks. In search of something comforting, I decide to venture to some nearby neighborhoods. Less than a year ago, my friends and I would walk around the neighborhoods south of campus to talk about classes and smoke. These ritualized walks became a staple in my daily routine and the foreign area of Eugene became familiar to me. Coming from Las Vegas, and being a freshman in college, the entire university experience was new to me. Being a newcomer to Eugene, and the overall atmosphere of the northwest, I held a certain amount of anxiety to living in a new place and meeting new people. After a short while, I met a few guys, who lived in the same hall I did, and we spent a lot of our free time together conversing, venting, smoking, and learning, but I digress. I venture off the cracked sidewalk and cross the street. Just past the sidewalk is a large, wooden tunnel that towers over me as I pass through. On the other side of the tall, wooden tunnel is a grey and black ball of fur and fangs standing in the middle of a patch of grass.
A raccoon the size of an overweight bulldog stares at me while its mouth hangs open, flashing sharp rows of teeth and fangs where he stands just five feet away from me. Our eyes meet. I could see the reflection of the lamps by the museum shining off his black eyes. I freeze, fearful that any move I make may scare the raccoon and cause him to attack me. I feel mad for a split second because I am too afraid to pass the raccoon, to test his patience; he claims this area. He kept eye contact with me, marking his territory, standing his ground. I see the open sidewalk in front of me, but I cannot move. Instead I am confronted by a living, wild road block in the form of a raccoon. He could attack me at any moment, jump at my shaking legs and claw at my body till he was finished. I can feel the thumping of my pulse in my chest and around my jugular. My pounding pulse surely must be visible to the raccoon. I am powerless against his brute force and wild instincts. I imagine the raccoon scratching at my neck, fangs out biting at my body for any piece of flesh he could get a hold of. The raccoon’s mouth opened even wider as he took a step closer to me. It was time for him to get rid of the intruder. My heart elevated to my throat. Fight or flight.
I begin to back up without realizing it. About face and then I fast-walk back to campus as discretely as I can. I don’t want to show fear, for the raccoon could smell it and would take any advantage he could. A city in the middle of the desert doesn’t have wild animals lurking the streets, there are only diseased pigeons who avoid people. Encountering a feral raccoon is an experience I have never had, and knew right away I would not want to come across one of these creatures again. My fear arises from ignorance. Once I crossed the street, I turned my head and the raccoon was nowhere in sight.
I can breathe again. A moment of anticipation and joy interrupted and ruined with a glance. The memory of the raccoon’s dark eyes lives with me, always watching. My memories of the wooded, charming neighborhoods are tainted by the vacant gaze of a raccoon flashing his feral fangs as a warning. The international sign for no trespassing. There is still an inkling of space in the back of my mind that wonders if the raccoon meant no harm and would have idly watched me pass by his temporary residence in the grass. Perhaps I should have tried; perhaps I am smart not to have tried.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_13ywne,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/13ywne/an_encounter_with_a_raccoon_criticismcomments/,

Resting hands on knees, panting and sweaty, he takes a moment to catch his breath. They are after him. He has been running through this building for hours.  

Finding him has become a competition. We all want to be the one that traps the rabbit. He knows me from a time when I was on his side. I'm not sure if he will still trust me, but what's the worst that can happen?  

I gesture towards my door offering sanctuary, mouthing, ""Come on! They are right behind you!"" He scurries over, and darts under my arm just as a team of officers turns the corner. I shut the door behind him, and brace myself as he tries to force it open. 

""Hey, I found him! He's in here!""


He is trapped and knows it. His executioners walk in behind me. He sulks over to one of my desks. We shoot each other sideways glances as we take our positions. We nod silently saying, ""Good game."" 

His case manager storms in followed by a suit. She immediately begins to deliver the lecture she has been waiting all day to give. I sit closest to him. He won't hit me... but her... none of us are too sure about her. The suit sits closest to the door, looking uncomfortable and annoyed.

He tries to explain why he ran, but she had hours of chasing to prepare this speech. There were no planned pauses for his input. He is fidgeting and looking around the room. He knows I won't hesitate to tackle him if he makes a play for the door. He and I have been down that road together at ""the other place."" He locks eyes with me and I see big tears welling up. I can hear him telepathically asking for help. I want to scream at her to,

 ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" 

but he must have been reading my mind too because he bolts up and yells it. The suit says in his best authoritative voice, ""Kevin, stop.""
 
I think to myself, ""What's that bitch gonna do."" 

He and I lock eyes again and I ask, ""So, are you taking any art classes this year?"" He looks stunned. He wants another reason to yell but there isn't one. It dawns on him that I am throwing him an out and he grabs it with both hands. 

""Not yet, but I want to."" 

In the background the lecture from Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bitch continues, but we have entered into our own conversation bubble. In our bubble it is calm and quiet and the topic is art. 

""You know there are a lot of great courses offered here."" 

We maintain intense eye contact because this reprieve is fragile. 

""Is there a sculpture class? Remember when I made you...

POP!

I had heard it in the background too. The Bitch crossed the line. She is already at the phone and looking up the number for his mom. 

He begins to shake. ""You gonna call her so you can tell her more lies? Just like with that email you sent her."" He is getting angry again and his eyes are darting around the room. He is starting to panic. ""You know FUCK YOU BITCH! I've put up with fifteen years of abuse and you know that."" 

""I didn't lie in that email. It's not my fault if your mom didn't undesta..."" 

""It is your fault! I am back in that house now and I hate it. What happened over that email is YOUR FAULT."" 

She moves uncomfortably in her chair and looks away. She does feel the guilt. She changes her tone and softly says, ""I am so sorry if you got in trouble because your mom didn't understand my email."" 

He senses her weakness and lobs into his verbal assault. He goes on about how she lies and how much she hates him.  He begins to make fun of her for the tears in her eyes when I turn my gaze back towards him. 

""I know you don't like her, but do you know your brother hates ME?""  This phrase strikes him speechless. I have known him for years. I protected him from the bigger kids when we were at ""the other place."" He has cried in my arms more than once. 

""It's true. I am the one that has to boss him around and he hates me for it. I was just trying to figure out what to do with him before we found out you were missing. He is worried sick about you right now."" 

He studies my face to for a tell. I hold his gaze and continue. ""Did you hear her? What she said? She said she's sorry and that you're right. Do you think you can forgive her?""

His face twists with rage and tears stream down his cheeks. He looks at her and begins screaming again. I reach out and hold his hand. 

""You know, all of the problems with your mom were there before her. You can't blame her for what your mom did."" 

And just like when he was small he sobs in my arms. On cue, his brother walks in. Kevin runs up and hugs him. 

I would like to say he hugged Mrs. Bitch as well, but truth be told, as soon as she got him into the hall he took off running. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1354062665.0,,,True,t3_13wk6b,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/13wk6b/the_runner/,

            My job was a simple one. All I had to do was guard the Gate, and make sure nothing goes in or comes out. It was an easy job. I usually sat against the wall, whittling small figurines or sharpening my sword. The days were long, and my home was far from the Gate, but the pay made everything well worth it. I was able to easily provide for my wife and daughter, and still had plenty of money left over.

I missed my family dearly, however. I was only able to visit my home monthly because of the long journey between my home and the Gate, but I wouldn’t let it stop me from seeing my family. A week from today would be my daughter’s birthday, and I was going to leave in the morning to travel back home.

As I looked through the rain at the Gate’s silvery, mirror-like surface I saw a man. The man was in his early thirties, and was weary of his long days guarding the Gate. His dark brown hair was matted to his forehead from the steady downpour, and his short beard dripped small beads of water as the rain rolled down his face. His green eyes were kind and caring, and full of hope as he readied his pack for the morning. My face stared back at me, and suddenly grew dark and gaunt.

The man before me began to change, his figure distorting into something I had never seen. His arms extended into long, lanky things, his hands thinning almost to bone, his fingernails growing to razor edges. He began to tower over me as his legs grew as well. His face stretched and thinned itself, taking the shape of a skull. His eyes burrowed into his head, leaving only dark sockets that stared into my soul. His mouth stretched open, showing rows upon rows of knife-like teeth as he let out a terrifying moan.

I stumbled back and grabbed my sword out of my sheath, trying to hold it in my hands, shaking with fear. The creature stood in the Gate, howling and moaning, until it suddenly lifted its hand, and lunged toward me. I dropped my sword as it grasped my neck, strangling me as I struggled for air. It began to pull me toward it, slowly and tediously, as if it wanted to watch me suffer. I fought to breathe but could not break the creatures grasp, and the darkness surrounded me as it pulled me toward its gaping mouth.

..….

..….

I awoke terrified, grasping for air but finding that I did not need to breathe. I was walking down the path away from the Gate as if nothing happened. I could feel the weight of my pack on my shoulders, although it felt miniscule compared to how it normally felt. I felt strange as well. I felt strong and powerful, but at the same time I felt weak and powerless, as if something was controlling me. I swatted tree branches away from my head as I walked down the path and tried to stop, but my legs would not listen and kept walking.

I had walked this path every day for years and I was never tall enough to worry about the tree branches. I looked down at myself and horror sunk into my soul. I was the creature, and the creature was me. I had somehow entered the creature that had come out of the Gate, but I could do nothing to control myself. I was a prisoner inside of its body, and all I could do was watch as it walked as me. I was unable to stand the revelation, and I fainted, although my body trudged on.

..….

..….

I awoke again, my legs running in full sprint towards a small town. The town seemed familiar, but I could not gather my thoughts enough to give it a name. My body slowed as I walked into town, receiving welcomes from passerby in the town center. I screamed at them, wondering how they did not see this dark, demonic creature as they waved their hellos, but no sound escaped my lips. I passed the window of a small store and saw why.   

As I looked at the windows clear, mirror-like surface and I saw a man. The man was in his early thirties, and was weary of his long days traveling home. His dark brown hair was ruffled and dirty, and his short beard was ragged from the long days of travel. His green eyes were dark and sinister, and were empty of any emotion as he stood in front of the window. My face stared back at me, and I cried out in anger and fear.

My body continued toward a small home in the back of the village, and my heart sank with fear. I saw Lily, my daughter, playing in the garden, and I saw my wife, Ann, through the window. Lily ran towards me and hugged me tight, and my body picked her up and smiled at her. She didn’t think anything was wrong, and my body put her down so she could continue playing in the garden. I walked into my home and I glanced at the mirror in the hallway. My face smiled at me as it drew a small dagger out of its sheath and hid it behind my back. I began to weep as I saw what was about to happen. My body turned and stopped as Ann rushed towards me. I screamed at myself as my arm thrust forward, and my life shattered.

I guarded that Gate so that I could provide for my wife and daughter. I guarded that Gate so I could build a better life for my family. I guarded that Gate because I loved them more than anything. I guarded that Gate, and it ruined my hopes, my dreams, and destroyed everything I cared for.

The clock struck twelve.

I awoke.

I was alone.

I would forever be alone.

I got out of bed, my feet tentatively reaching for the floor.

One foot, another, toe by toe.

One has to be careful getting out of bed.

You never know just when the floor will disappear on you.

Really.

It’s happened to me before.

I slipped into my slippers, donned my housecoat. It would be another one of those days, apparently. The days that are filled with despair from the start. At least there would be no false hope this time. It had been too long to start hoping again.

Shuffling downstairs, I wondered: Would this be all there ever would be for me? Eternity, stuck in this prison? Had I no chance of escape?

No.

I did not.

But no matter. I was more or less used to it by now.

More or less.

In the kitchen, I opened the fridge, grabbed the milk and blueberries. I always enjoyed blueberries with my cereal. I snatched a bowl from the shelf behind me, Cheerios from the cupboard beside it. I poured the blueberries and Cheerios into the bowl simultaneously. It was tradition, after all. Then the milk. Always the milk last. Can’t break tradition. If people start breaking tradition, then their floors start falling away.

I took a spoon from the cutlery drawer, set it by the bowl, and headed towards the front door to bring in the morning paper. But she was there, visible just on the other side of the peephole. I could see her howling and screaming and crying. In my mind I could hear the words that were being formed a short distance away. A very short distance, and yet infinitely far. I wanted to open the door. I wanted to let her in. I wanted to hold her and caress her and love her more than anything in the world. But I couldn’t open the door now, not even to get the paper.

She was lost to me forever.

She was my wife.

Instead, I stared mournfully through the glass, knowing that this day would not be so simple after all. There would be hope. And it would be crushed.

She was not alone. My mother was there, and my father. My sister and brother. My aunts and uncles and cousins and friends. Everyone who still cared for me or loved me was standing just outside, just out of reach. I knew, and I could do nothing. I could not even tell them that I knew. I could not even tell them that I was here. They just had to guess. Guess and hope.

Knowing that there would be no paper today, I decided on some television instead. I turned away from the door, towards the living room. It had windows facing the front of my house. I could see the throng of people crowding around, growing ever larger. I shut the curtains. They would do no good now. It was too late. It had always been too late.

I switched on the TV, flicked to the news. I flicked to the news every morning. It was tradition. And, as tradition dictated, the same story was playing. Every morning the top news item was the same. In the papers, on the TV, even on the internet, it was the same. There had been a car crash. A man on his daily commute home from work had been blindsided by a drunk driver as he turned off the highway. The man’s car had fishtailed and flipped and struck a pole. The drunk driver’s had run off the road. The drunk driver died. The man did not. He was rushed to the nearest hospital, declared to be in critical condition. The doctors hoped he would wake up and make a full recovery. He hadn’t done either.

I turned off the news, switched to sports. It was the same game that had been playing for as long as I could remember. For as long as that man had been comatose the Blue Jays had been playing the Pirates in spring training baseball. It was a tradition, after all. I knew each play before it happened. The game was boring. I turned back to the news, and for the first time in a long time it was different.

I was shocked. I remembered the story of the man like it was my own. I could feel my fingers gripping the steering wheel as I was hit, vomit splashing into my face as the car was hurled into the pole, the pain spreading through my nervous system like cracks through marble. I could remember the dread, and then the hopelessness. I could remember the world going black as I gave up. I had relived this story through the news so many times I was convinced it was my own.

But it was gone. There was a new story today. They had finally given up on the unconscious man. They were going to let him die peacefully. There was a camera capturing the whole event. After all, this was a man who had captivated the nation, the world, the universe. His wife was clutching his hand, howling and screaming and crying. His mother and father stood next to his bed. So did his sister and brother, his aunts and uncles and cousins and friends. Everyone who still cared for him or loved him. His wife pulled the cord.

Here again. Tired of the ebbs and flows of the sea. Frustrated at its isolation. The smooth rocking no longer nauseating but not yet therapeutic. Salt encrusted skin. The sun bearing down. Burning. Tanning. I sit here. Still. The sea - my fortress of solitude. I resent it. Stopping the future. Barrier to the civilized world. The foam from the waves distant on the sea. I wish I could be them. Escape this place. Move on. A tear tattooed on my skin, stains my cheek. 
I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless.
That only men incredulous of despair,
Half Taught in anguish, through the midnight air beat upwards to god’s throne. 
I watch the sun set, over the town. My longing now crimson, burning…

John Galt 
The taste of wood hung in the air, lingering under my nose. Another calm night, the young couple sit there chatting quietly, abstaining from their heart’s desires. I sit here, ordering another beer. I light a cigarette, disgusting things, but they sooth the soul. The cold air whips me awake, back from the murky afflictions of alcohol. The window mirroring me. Disgusting man doing disgusting things, the condensation clung like tears to my mirror’s face. 
She poured me another drink, the foam bubbling as it reached the top, like people trying to escape. Winners of the contest of life, those select remarkable, extraordinary, lonely few whom life had both gifted and cursed. I put my empty glass down, the bitter brew beginning its familiar softening works. 
He is here again but they don’t see him. 
“Ignoring me again? 
“…” 
“Stop drinking, you know I’m right”
I have another beer. The girl scrubs the table tops. Its late, but she is still here. He ruins the atmosphere, creating an air of unease. I feel it, the others don’t. They continue their lives. Unremarkable, Ordinary. 
“She would be about her age now” 
“Just leave” 
The girl looks at me quizzically. 
“Sorry” I mumble, back to my drink of self-loathing and disgust. The condensation dripping like tears from the glass
The she returns to her work. 
He chuckles.

I wake to the sea water splashing through the porthole, recoating my face in its salty poison. Supplies are running low. Finally. I have an excuse to return. Back to the land of the living. I go out on deck, Turn the wheel back to port. As I approach the sun burns my back, skin starting to flake. 
I dock. Re-joining the civilized world. I think to myself, pondering. I look around. The smell of sewerage and fish guts. Fills me with a longing, to be part of humanity.
I clean the deck of the, what would appear to be salt but more than likely dead skin which abandons me. I look onto the dock.
She is here again. Watching me. Not saying anything, just standing. 
I continue about my work, ignoring her presence. Scrubbing the deck, clearing the bins, restocking the fridge. I get up. 
I think I will visit my mother.

John Galt
I pass through the gates again, the inscriptions no longer appeal or comforting to me. Back to work, visiting my daughter again, watching over her. I clear the grounds, trimming and uprooting weeds. Here again. 
He leans against the tree tossing an apple. 
“John how are you feeling?” 
“Why are you here?”
“To keep you company John, Don’t you appreciate me?” 
“No. You are irritating me. I think it’s time you leave”
“I can’t do that, you don’t want me to leave” 
Time to wash her face again; she has gotten dirty since I’ve last been here. The sweet air eases my post-alcohol brain haemorrhage. I rip out weeds in her garden that don’t belong, taking extra care not to disturb her while she rests. There is someone else here, someone real who isn’t part of me. I don’t mind, it’s nice to have company, silent but comforting.

Richard Dunn 
Isabelle Galt, I think that’s his daughter. I wonder what happened. Looks like there are some weeds growing on my mother’s bed. 
He looks like he hasn’t slept in weeks. Staring at her grave again. He is there every time I visit. 
I begin to clear out mother’s bed, clearing the weeds and dead flowers, as she would have done. They are probably from Dad. I slump down next to her tomb. Easing my back against the edge. I can’t do this for too long. I can’t bear it. 
“Do you mind?” John asks motioning towards a cigarette. He is very vocal today. Its unusual. Inviting. 
“It’s ok; I understand how you feel it’s been a rough time for me too.” He lights the death stick. I stare into the flame, enchanting and haunting. 
“How long has it been?” I ask. He ponders avoiding my eyes. Staring up. Blowing smoke to the sky.
“12 years” Still staring into the clouds. “You?”
“6.”

“It’s nice to see him talking. It’s been years since he talked to anyone apart from myself and the barkeep.” 
She nods not taking her eyes off Richard. 
“How long have you been with him?” 
She glances at me, piercing blue eyes, pale face, and delicate white hands. “5 and a half years.” She goes back to watching Richard. “I think he needs a friend” 
“John does too, but it’s hard. You care for them so much but all I can do is watch.” 
“I know. We haven’t spoken you know?” 
“You and Richard?” 
“Yeah, he can’t bear to look at me. It’s hard for him, I remind him of his mother.”

John Galt
This talk is restorative. Helps me get my mind in order, it’s like a load being lifted. No longer so alone, but I guess it’s only temporary. 
“So what happened?” This question again. I hate it. Reminding me, of my sin. Of the cross that I carry. 
“Car crash.” I say, not wanting to explain further. But he looks at me expectantly. Watching. 
“I was driving her home from the beach. She wanted some ice-cream and was kicking the seat. I turned back to scold her, and …” tears streamed my face. No longer just on the mirror. I stared into my soul again and once more hated what I saw. I took long drag. Holding it, burning myself with it. 
“How did you lose your mother?”
He pauses, staring at the ground then back at me. The internal struggle evident in his eyes. His eyes moistened for a bit. 
“I was out with some friends, you know? Young, drunk and stupid.” He takes a deep breathe, trying to calm himself. “I had come home drunk and started to cook myself a pizza when I fell asleep. The next thing I know there’s smoke everywhere and my mum is screaming for me to wake up. Then a beam fell and that was it.” 
*** 
Richard Dunn
He looked genuinely apologetic. Upset at himself for bringing it up. I can feel myself crying, a good cry. The flood of emotions unstoppable by any barriers. My throating getting coarse with tears. The tears drop onto her grave, darking a patch from grey to a more darker but welcoming colour. I try and apologize but he just looks at me. Knowing. Accepting. I wipe my nose on my sleeve, and try and stand. But my legs give out. Unable to carry the now crying blubber of a man. 
He walks away. Obviously unable to deal with the mess of a man I have become. 
I sit, staring at the sky, able to accept the harsh reality. It was my fault.
He’s back. With tissues and some tea. He hands me the tissues and I take them, connecting with him. An understanding of pain now evident between us. 
“I know.”
The only words to leave his mouth. I know. No longer desperately lonely.
*** 
Richard Dunn
It’s been a week. An isolated but no longer lonely week. I decide to return, back to the cemetery. 
As I walk through the gates. I take my time, absorbing the sights a new. The inscription: 
You didn’t Die
You just changed shape
Become invisible to the naked eye
Become this grief.
I now understand the words before me. Accepting them.
She is here, waiting at the grave. Watching me. 
“Hello” I say for the first time.
She smiles silently. I don’t know what to do. 
Said she, ‘I will not live with grief from morrow unto morrow; 
My heart cries out for some relief, Good-bye, my little sorrow.’
“Then joy stepped in” 
She nods knowingly. 
Finally.

I Found this english translation somewhere online a few years ago. It is the most powerful story I have ever read, and it moves me so very deeply each and every time read it. And I hope you will take the time to read it today. 

Something is always lost in translation, but not too much I hope.

*Stig Dagerman - To kill a child*

It is a fine day and the sun rests over the plain. Soon the bells shall sound, for it is sunday. Between a pair of wheat fields two youths have found a path that they've never trod before and in the plain's three villages the windowpanes are shining. Men shave in front of the mirrors on the kitchen tables and women slice bread for the coffee and children sit on the floors buttoning their jackets. It is the happy morning of an evil day, for this day a child shall be killed in the third village by a happy man. As yet the child sits on the floor and buttons its jacket and the man who is shaving says that today they shall take a boat trip down the river and the woman softly sings and serves the freshly sliced bread on a blue plate.

There falls no shadow over the kitchen and yet the man who shall kill the child stands by a red gas pump in the first village. It is a happy man who looks into the camera and in the glass he sees a small blue car and beside the car a young girl who laughs. While the girl laughs and the man takes the beatiful picture the gas salesman tightens the lid on the gas tank and say they will have a fine day. The girl sits down in the car and the man who shall kill a child takes his wallet out of his pocket and say they shall go to the sea and by the sea they'll rent a boat and row far, far out. Through the open windows the girl in the front seat hears what the man is saying, she closes her eyes and when she does so she sees the sea and the man next to her in the boat. He's not an evil man, he's content and happy and before he gets into the car he stands for a moment in front of the radiator which shines in the sun and he enjoys the shine and the smell of gas and bird-cherries. There falls no shadow over the car and the shining fender has no dents and it is not red with blood.

But at the same time as the man in the car in the first village slams shut the door to his left and starts the car the woman in the kitchen in the third village opens her cupboard and finds no sugar. The child who has barely had time to button its jacket and tied its shoes stands on his knees on the couch and sees the river winding its way between the trees and the black little boat that lies pulled up on the grass. The man who shall lose his child is finished shaving and is folding his mirror. On the table stands the cups of coffee, the bread, the cream and the flies. It is only the sugar which is lacking and the mother tells her child to run to Larson's and borrow a few lumps. And while the child opens the door the man shouts after it to hurry, because the boat waits on the beach and they shall row further out than they ever have rowed. When the child then runs through the garden it thinks all the time about the river and the boat and the fish who are swimming and nobody whispers to it that it has eight minutes to live and that the boat shall remain where it rests all day and many days thereafter.

It's not far to Larson's, it's only across the road and while the child runs across the road the little blue car enters the second village. It's a small village with small red houses and newly awake people who sit in their kitchens with their coffee cups raised and watch the car drive by on the other side of the hedge with a large cloud of dust trailing behind it. It goes very fast and the man in the car sees the apple trees and the freshly tarred telephone poles glimpse by like grey shadows. Summer flows through the windows, they race out of the village, they lie in the middle of the road nice and secure and alone - as yet. It's good to drive all alone on a soft, broad road and out on the plain it goes even better. The man is happy and strong and with his right elbow he feels his woman's body. He is not an evil man. He's hurrying to the sea. He couldn't hurt a wasp, and yet he shall soon kill a child. While they rush towards the third village the girl again closes her eyes and plays that she won't open them until they can see the sea and she dreams in harmony with the the soft bumps of the car about how serene it will be.

For so uncaring is life constructed that a minute before a happy man kills a child he is still happy and a minute before a woman screams with fear she can close her eyes and dream of the sea and the last minute of a child's life this child's parents can sit in the kitchen and wait for sugar and speak of their child's white teeth and about a rowing boat and the child itself can close a gate and start walking across a road with a few lumps of sugar wrapped in white paper in its right hand and this entire last minute nothing see except a long, shiny river and a broad boat with silent oars.

Afterwards it is all too late. Afterwards a blue car stands on the road and a screaming woman removes her hand from her mouth and the hand is bleeding. Afterwards a man opens a car's door and tries to stand upright although he has a hole of horror inside himself. Afterwards a few lumps of sugar lie randomly scattered in blood and gravel and a child lies unmoving on its belly with its face tightly pressed against the ground. Afterwards two pale-faced people who have not yet had their coffee run out of a gate and see a sight on the road that they shall never forget. For it is not true that time heals all wounds. Time does not heal a dead child's wound and and it heals very poorly the pain of a mother who has forgot to buy sugar and sends her child across the road to borrow some and just as poorly does it heal the grief of the once happy man who has killed it.

For he who has killed a child does not go to the sea. He who has killed a child goes quietly home and beside him he has a silent woman with her hand bandaged and in all the villages they pass they see not one happy person. All the shadows are very dark and when they part it is still under silence and the man who has killed the child knows that this silence is his enemy and that he will need years of his life to defeat it by shouting that it wasn't his fault. But he knows that is a lie and in his nights' dreams he shall instead wish his life back so he could make this single minute different.

But so uncaring is life against the man who has killed a child that everyting after is too late.

                            Wicker Basket Warriors
In the year of 1812, there was a man floating down the Swiggle river in the fall.  He noticed a man on the bank who was picking leaves outta of the water with his tooth.  The guy floating down the river was floating in a one man canoe.  His name was Buck Chunker, a man of remarkable power.  Nomes Chomper was the name of  the guy picking the leaves out of the water with his one tooth.  They aired high fived to each other with great ambition.  
“What are you doing out here Nomes Chomper?” asked Buck Chunker.  “Imma tryin’ to tickle mah gums!”, said Nomes Chomper.  “Daggum, that seems mighty difficult to do with one toof!”  Stated Buck.“ You making  fun of the way I talk?”  As one leaf was dangling from Nomes Chomper face.  “It seemed harder than two icicles in a snow storm” exclaimed Buck Chunker.  “It aint too bad Buck, you just have to hook it with your special toof!”.  “Speakin of which whattana, whattana, whattana, whattana…. “ Nomes began to stutter and starting pointing off into the distance. After breaking his stutter he exclaims, “Whattana, Whattana, you seem offly lonely in that one man canoe”.   “Whooyeee  that is all ye can fit in a one man canoe, Nomes.  I been fishin for unicorn fish, the wonderbread fish!” belched Chunker.  As Buck was saying that, a strange noise came from a tree.  
As a tree branch snapped you could see the  silhouette of a man falling down and screaming “sweet gypsy kite” as the man splashed into the river.  The way he entered the water caused such a loud rockous twelve trees became dragons and flew off. The bellowing of the splash caused Buck and Nomes to fear cannon fire.  Nomes reached for a pebble and places it on his head.  Nomes special ability was camouflage, as he could use nature to hide from any danger. They had  feared the sound of cannon fire because a battle had recently just broke out between the Americans and the Red Coats at Slip Dizzy Rock.
Buck looked over to where he last seen Nomes and he was very perplexed that the man that was standing there had vanished.  Being heavily distracted from what just happened Buck floated down the river towards the noise with great curiosity.  Buck did not use a paddle to float down the river, however he used his abnormal hand size to power through rip currents.  As he floated towards the sound, he recognized the sound of someone groaning injured.  
“OHHHHHHHH, that kinda hurt” said a balloon faced man with scarecrow clothes. Buck paddled by to check on this wondering stranger. The guy looked up at Buck and said, “at’ll be the last time I walk that far on that limb gain”.  “Well who be you, tall timbering stranger?  And why were up in dat tree up der?” questions Buck.  As Buck was finishing his question ,a box of thin mint girl scout cookies hits Buck in the shoulder.  Miles responded, “I was trying to clear my rear! But, as I bent over the branch snapped and I flew faster than a jack-rabbit on opium.” 
In the midst of deep conversation sounds erupted from the pebbles of the river and mysteriously appeared Nomes Chomper.   Nomes picked up the cookies and said, “I ain’t had one of these in years!”.  Miles quickly responds by throwing a rock and knocked the cookies out of his hand. “you you almost knocked out my toof” paniced Nomes.  The balloon faced man said, “you don’t wanna eat that.  Those special delicious cookies were used to clean my bottom. Them cookies were butt treats.”  Nomes stood there confused, mouth wide open, trying to understand what Miles meant.
The dusk sky made the scene almost majestic with the way that the leaves fell onto the surface of the river. The approaching darkness became more frightening though when the sound of falling leaves was broken up with the pops and cracks of gun fire off in the distance. Nomes broke the silence by saying “Ya’ll don’t want to head that direction. It ain’t nothin’ but trouble over there. I just came from it, thanks to them redcoats havin us surrounded on three sides.” Buck and Miles looked at Nomes and told him to lead the way since he knew where not to go. Nomes responds to this surprised leadership role he was given with excitement.  He says, “I know this woman just downriver, but we gots to be careful ‘cuz of Indians and redcoats got patrols out here.”
They began to gather what little they had on them and headed down the banks of the river to the woman’s house. After a few hundred yards, Buck grabs ahold of Miles and palm-faced him followed up by “I’m sick of smellin’ your dingle berry.” He pushed Miles to the ground behind him to convince him to be last in this line. They continue to sneak their way down the remainder of the river, nearly being caught by both Indian and redcoat patrols due to Buck’s flipper like feet slapping the ground as he walked.
After walking through the darkness for many hours, they come upon a shack in a field that was lit solely by the moon. Nomes looks back to the new-found posse and lets them know that this is the safe house of the woman known as Big Red. He stops the others on the edge of the wood line and says, “I gotta go up there alone and let me convince her to let us stay here. I’ll give ya’ll a signal to let ya know you’re good to come on up.” He then indicates the signal by placing his hand into his armpit and making a sound like a chubby frog eating kettle corn. 
Nomes disappeared to the front of this shack for a few short minutes. He came back to the field and gave them the signal to let know that she was alright with harboring them. The two that were in the woods moved swiftly across the field and up to the home. They were greeted by a woman at the door with hair as red as Norwegian crawl-dog munchin’ on sloppy joes. They expressed their gratitude for her generosity, very much appreciative of safe sleeping quarters. 
She showed them into the cellar where she insured that they would remain safe and hidden. As they began to settle in, Big Red came in carrying hay for someone to sleep on, a warm quilt for another, and a sheep so fat it looked like a Puerto Rican mosquito after sucking on Buck’s thumb for the third person. Miles quickly yelled “DIBS!” pointing towards the fluffy sheep. Nomes and Buck agreed that neither wanted to be so selfish so they manned up and decided to share the hay and warm quilt with dancing fairy’s shucking oysters imprinted on it.  Miles unashamedly cuddle up with the sheep. After a few moments of all of them restlessly tossing and turning Nomes unexpectedly cut on the latern put  a pebble on his head and said “ I can’t stop thinking about that beared lady from the carnival screaming  “ I’ll scallop your mustache!” pointing at a sloppily dressed british officer in the middle of the fighting at slip dizzy.”  As Nomes proclaimed this, the three men bursted into laughter and conversation drifted off into the midst of night.

How I long to wrap my fingers around her neck. Or maybe I would hide underneath her covers until she gets home from school, peek my eyes out from under the blanket and watch her set her Dora the Explorer backpack on her toy covered floor. Then, as she sits on her Disney princess chair, coloring pinks and purples, I will leap out like a ninja, not being seen or heard until I want her to see and hear me.     

But, I am trapped in this cage. She mocks me with her baby talk. Her voice a high-pitched whine equivalent to the shrieks of rusted swings in which children like her swing on at their schools. She says I’m cute. 

Even what she calls me, Daisy, humiliates me. Emasculates me. If I could, I would show her how cute I really am, when my nails draw blood across her chubby cheeks. How cute I can be when her blonde hair is wet and curled from tears as she cries out for her mommy. Still, to her I am a friend, appealing in every way, as a true predator is.

She wouldn’t be my first victim. Abby with her long, straight, dark hair always a mess, was my first. She was six years old and more of a tomboy than my current girl Hannah. Her mother tried to dress her in floral dresses with her hair pulled back in pony tails on top of her head, but that lasted about five minutes until a temper tantrum and tears led to jeans and her hair in her face. I never did care for Abby.

 “Princess,” shrieked Abby. To this child I was Princess. A name and a concept I loathe.  She grabbed me with her chocolate covered fingers. Chocolate from a Hershey bar given to her by her mother after giving up pleading with her to eat cereal instead. “At school today we are going to make turkeys for Thanksgiving. My friend Ashley says that she has seen a real live turkey before but I don’t believe her.”

I tried to drown out her squeaky voice and insignificant details of her life. My hands pushed against her hands but my efforts to squirm free were useless. I could smell the sweetness of the chocolate mixed with her sweaty hands. Abby was disgusting. Why anyone would want to have children I will never understand. A part of you that’s less than half your size but controls you and takes you for granted. Abby was too young to be thankful for her mother but without her she would be vulnerable, an easy victim for any predator.

“Abby the school bus is here,” her mother called out from downstairs in the kitchen. In haste she tossed me back into the cage. My back hitting the water bottle. She ignored my hurt cries and grabbed her backpack and tromped down the stairs. 

One day, Abby’s mom had just finished cleaning my cage and when she placed me back in, she left the cover cracked. A visible separation of freedom or confinement. Separate. I could relate to that. A line drawn in my mind dividing reason and empathy. I sometimes wonder why I am like this. Some people say that it’s fucked up childhood experiences that shape one into an emotionless monster. I suppose that could be so.

 When I was young, the first boy I lived with, Patrick, failed to separate my father from my mother and siblings. I watched my father eat my brother and sister alive. My father would’ve gotten me as well if he hadn’t already been filled up on his own flesh and blood. It took two days for the Patrick’s mother to realize what had happened and find the tiny bodies buried in saw dust.

I guess to spare Patrick of the massacre that had taken place his mother decided to dispose of the evidence. I watched in the corner of the cage as she picked up the stiff bodies of my siblings with tissue paper and walked into the bathroom. I couldn’t see what happened; only the blue paint on the wall and his mother’s pedicured blackish-purple toenails. But I heard the plunks of objects being submerged and the harsh swish of water. My mother and I were placed in one cage and my father in another and we were taken back to the store from which we came. 

 While Abby was at school I had escaped. But before I could leave she needed to get what she deserved. I knew her habits: homework, dinner, a bath and bed. I sat on her windowsill, blending in with the brown teddy bears and unicorns which were far more innocent than me. I watched as her mom tucked her in and Abby listened attentively as she was read a princess story. Every young girl loves princesses. 

They long to grow up and find their Prince Charming who will sweep them off their feet and save the day. Well Abby, Prince Charming isn’t here and instead of accepting a role of submissiveness and helplessness, perhaps you should have better prepared yourself for a situation such as this. 

As her mother left and shut the door and she buried her face in her pillow, I jumped off the ledge and buried my fur in her face. It startled her and she jerked her head violently back and forth, her hair slapping me in the face- a weapon I did not account for.

“Mom,” Abby screamed. 

My little hands struggled to grab her neck. My nails barely broke skin. I thought about biting her nose but before I could she pushed me off of the bed and onto the floor. In her feetie-pajamas she rolled out of bed and stumbled through the dark room towards the door. 

“Mom,” Abby cried again. Her breathing became raspy and as she tried to yell again only a whisper came out in between the wheezing of her breaths. She fell to the floor.

The light from a nightlight illuminated her face. I stared her in the eyes as she looked at me, terrified. Warmness filled my stomach as I watched her struggle to breath. A feeling I expect one would feel when getting a hug, or seeing a loved one; but not a feeling I have ever experienced before that night.

Her mother and father ran into the room. Abby’s eyes were still locked on me as they tried to figure out was wrong. Her father kicked me away and I scurried under a dresser.

 Soon sirens from ambulances filled the house. Abby was assessed and calmed down and after deciding it was only a minor asthma attack she was released and spent the night in her parent’s room protected between her mother and father.

The next morning Abby’s mom searched the room before finding me in the closet. 

“You evil fucking hamster,” she said almost growling in a hushed voice.

Someone finally knew my secret, my urges. She grabbed me and squeezed me hard as she threw me back into the cage. As we drove in silence in the car I knew I was going back to the pet store, but I don’t blame them for being uncomfortable with having someone like me around.

That’s when Hannah came into my life. Her nose pressed up against the glass of my cage in the pet store “Mommy, I want that one.” By “that one” I’m sure she didn’t mean the one who can feel nothing towards anyone, who will never love her when she cuddles him and who can only exhibit faked emotions and forced normal behaviors.

I suppose Hannah isn’t half bad for a human. She does want me to live a normal life, have friends, exercise, enjoy myself.  First, she introduced me to Boots. I attempted to have a healthy relationship with Boots. He was a bigger hamster, and all black with a white splotch on his chest. But he was always eating my portion of the food. “Boots, I do not mind sharing my home with you, but I would appreciate it if you would share the food equally,” I explained to him. I have become good at hiding who I really am from the time spent at the pet store as well as the many months spent pretending to be a normal pet.

“Hey, Daisy, how about you mind your own god damn business,” said Boots. He looked at me and laughed-snorting a little in the process.

 Well, after all this is a hamster eat hamster world and Darwin would appreciate my applying of the concept survival of the fittest. A few days later I was walking around the cage but stopped by the wheel with my back turned to Boots. “Hey, you actually left me a food pellet over here by the wheel? Thank you. I appreciate your generosity,” I said sarcastically. 

“What?” asked Boots.

“Well I was just saying that I had you all wrong Boots. You are a great guy.”

Boots squinted his eyes and shook his head. “What the hell, you are weird.” He walked over to the wheel and I pushed him down lodging his head between the wires of the wheel.

 “You know what you have done to deserve this Boots,” I said, gently rocking the wheel back and forth causing pressure to build up and release around his throat.

He began to speak but a quick spin on the wheel snapped his neck for Boots and that was the last time he bothered me.

After that there was Delilah. It was exciting to have a woman with me. The companionship was great at first, but then she started accusing me of not paying enough attention. Stuck together day after day in a cage, I don’t know how I she could have thought I was neglecting her. 

“I don’t understand why you treat me like this. You never let me in. If you won’t try to make me happy maybe I should find someone who will,” she complained, her voice almost as annoying as the little girl’s that claim me.

It was the same argument every time. “Delilah,” I said. “You know I care about you. I’m sorry I can’t show it but you know I do.”

“You never say the right things, you just say something that makes you look like you aren’t the bad guy and I am overreacting but I’m not. I’m sick of this.” 

I was sick of it too. Obviously my expression of emotions wasn’t as mastered as I had though. But she had to go. And when we went for a stroll in our hamster balls- her pink, mine red- and hers just happened to roll down a flight of stairs no one expected me of nudging it.

Hannah is no more threatening than me. Misunderstood sometimes, when she does things that hurt me, just as every child I have ever known has. Some days she doesn’t even acknowledge I’m there. Sometimes she forgets to feed me or pets too hard. Maybe she doesn’t know she’s hurting me or maybe she is too young to understand, just as I can’t understand relationships, or trust or love.

I could keep this girl around. Maybe it would be good for me. Every normal hamster wants a child to take care of it. Not a life lived on some store shelf in a crowded cage until you get mean and they isolate you in your own cage. Then you get old and no one will want to love you, your fur dull in color, appeal lost forever. So then they feed you to the snakes. I’m not saying a snake can’t be outsmarted, but the concept isn’t a pleasant one.

Maybe I can be normal, forget my past and try not to hurt every living thing that comes in contact with me. Or maybe I am too hopeful and being this way isn’t a choice, but a disease that that darkens your mind. Until I figure this out, I’m going to sit here watching Hannah, watching you, as an unsuspected predator.

Tightening my grip, I carried on through the disconsolate woods, forcing his weakened body to follow. The shadows that had taken over the gaps in the trees seemed more intense than ever, and the stillness that occupied them only emphasised the near silence being picked up by my ears. My free hand reached out ahead, feeling out for the familiar path of branches that had so often guided me this way. Despite having been interrupted by my presence many times, the little life that the woods displayed refused to show any signs of wear, only doing me favours as our tracks were swallowed up the minute we passed through. The short journey always seemed to be way longer among the darkened hours of the clock cycle, although I had never been able to decipher why. A sudden slope in the ground indicated me of our arrival.

I could sense the gush of hope flood through him as my grasp faltered, yet his realisation kicked in a few seconds late as my other hand pushed him down to the ground. 

“Don’t. Move.” My unyielding voice instructed him with the tools to his ‘survival’.

Taking a step back, I stole a moment to observe his actions. As I looked harder, I began subconsciously comparing the almost lifeless body before me, to myself. Only now, did I notice the resemblance. The greasy black hair, long enough to pass as a woman’s, clung protectively to our oddly proportioned faces. Both of us modelled the same pair of deeply sunken eyes, too small for our faces, and they made it impossible for us ever to appear happy, not that they would have gotten much use out of that function. We both had slightly similar builds; however he was noticeably smaller and weaker than me. It was this factor that I had taken advantage of.

Realising I was hesitating; I got straight back into action. The only thing wasting time would gain me is more chance of being caught, and that was definitely something that I did not want.
	
Wrestling it from my otherwise empty pocket, I could see the shine of the metal reflecting off of the tears rapidly forming in his eyes. He knew what was coming. I waited for the signal. A whole hour was crushed into two seconds as my ready reflexes waited for the cry. He trembled. I waited. What was he doing? I began to feel my anger -with a definite mix of anxiety- build up… I wasn’t used to change, they had all reacted the same. Yet within another instant my fears were ruptured with the shrill sounds of his voice box, and my anger quickly deflated. There it was, there was my signal.
	
Almost controlling itself, as if the constant repeated action had given it its own memory, the blade (smaller than you would imagine, yet the efficiency still remained) cut the sound out of the air, taking chunks of his throat with it. A spark shot up my spine, shocking my mouth into the malicious smile that serenaded the last few moments of this man’s memory.
	
His body turned limp. 
	
“Now you are free,” I whispered.

The bird on the wall squawked once. It had flung itself into the stagnant air for a moment, pausing only long enough to cry its chord, then vanished into its nest once more. It fell silent. Everything was silent. The hallways were silent, no longer begging for the soft steps for which they had once longed. The door frame was cut and marked to varying degrees, with names and numbers scrawled in caring script. The kitchen was calm, the measured dripping of the faucet's tears had long since dried into apathy. The living room lacked its own eponymous nature, its couches and chairs tired and layered in heavy, gray lethargy. Out front, the pumps were dry and thirsty, pleading for a drink, a drink inevitably denied by the cracked dirt of the stone well. An old wooden bucket, moldy with maturity, lay still and silent, in mimicry of the world it knew. The house was empty.
   
 The silence broke all at once, and rain fell swiftly, sure and confident the land it softened would give no resistance. The land had long since been claimed by the rain and had resigned itself to its domain. As the rain descended, the sun melted away, unable to compete with the storm. A once great entity reduced to flaming rubble on the horizon, still emitting light, faintly, however unnecessary light happened to be.

It would have been hard to breathe, the trees had long since been uprooted or toppled. They no longer had the will to breathe life into the world, and the world too was too weary to sustain it. And thus the trees fell, and with them, the world held its breath.

The cracked dirt drank quickly, and cried, parched for more. The thirst was unquenchable, the more there was, the less it seemed. The rain stopped as suddenly as it had begun, and the Earth tried to cry, but the tears refused to flow. It feared the rain had forever ended, as it had once breathed in excess, now it craved the winds cool embrace. The sun shone again. This time brighter than before. Had someone cared to look, a wooden clock shaped like a house could be seen on the wall, preparing to sing the hour.

The dry ground had since decayed and warm methane breezes would often flow, dragging along streams of blood red dust, a parade for the emptiness. A window gave out, and the dust found the inside of the house becoming desert. And then the wind gave out and the dust settled permanently in it's new home. The last wind had come, and gone, and with it, had blown the last flame in the sky.

He laid his back against the cold tombstone and eased his gaze, his mind began to drift to a different place where he wouldn't have to remember the situation at hand. The sound of the creatures roaming mindlessly about was masked by the peaceful howl of the wind.  

For hours he sat motionless, his eyes had become well adjusted to the dark. He couldn't recall the last time he saw the sun; it was suicide to travel in daylight. But that wouldn't matter anymore. 

He was drained, the strength to travel east like he had planned was gone. One last look at his torso drenched in blood, the pain was dull now. This tombstone provided comfort; the wind had become still and silent. The sky began to fade into a violet hue, the air was warm and inviting.

Tears stained her cheeks, slightly smearing the makeup she wore and leaving light trails down her face. Her long black hair reached to her middle back, and flowed softly as she walked. Reaching a door, she opened it without knocking. The room she stepped into was simply furnished, a large desk opposite of the door taking up a large portion of the free space. The man behind the desk looked at her calmly, his soft eyes taking her in. He was a good looking man, with short blonde hair and blue eyes. Without speaking, he gestured towards the chair across from him, and she sat quickly.
 
“The police haven’t found anything yet. No one has any idea where he is. I-I don’t want to give up hope, but...” her voice trailed off as more tears started to come down her face. The man watched her for a moment, then reached out and covered her hand with his. Donna looked up and gave him a strained smile. “Thank you. Please, I want to know where he is, or at least if he is alive. Can you do this?”
 
The man smiled at her. “Did you bring something of his? Something he was close to?”  At his request, Donna held out the teddy bear.
 
“It was his favorite toy,” she said, her eyes lowering to the stuffed animal. The man took it and held it in front of him, his eyes rolling into the back of his head. Donna sat forward in wrapped interest.
 
“Its dark... I can’t see anything... so cold, so cold... I see him, he is curled up. He is calling ‘Mama, mama’. He is alive. He is alive.”  The man’s eyes snapped forward once more, and he started, glancing around. Then he looked at Donna once more and smiled. She once more had tears, but this time they were accompanied by a smile. The psychic handed the teddy bear back again, grasping her hands as he did so.
 
Donna walked out of the room, her heart several beats higher, clutching the bear once again. She almost missedthe dark-clad man leaning on the wall, outside the door.
 
“He is putting you on. There is no such thing as a psychic.” he said, is deep monotone little above a whisper. Black bangs hung over his teal eyes, and his tall frame was a good foot over Donna’s. She turned back to him, eyes searching his with a look of pity.
 
“Josh, I know you don’t believe. But I know that my son is alive now. How would he know that if he wasn’t psychic?”
“He doesn’t know it. There is no way of knowing. There’s a 50% chance that he is alive, or that he would be alive at the time of the prediction. He doesn’t know anything.” Josh’s eyes didn’t move from their position on the floor.
 
Donna turned her back to him, eyes closing to keep in the tears. “No, he has to know. Mama, that’s what my son calls me. He calls me Mama. He couldn’t have known that otherwise.”
 
There was silene behind her for a long moment. Then she heard a soft sigh.
 
“Just don’t get hurt, Donna. I don’t want you to have your hopes destroyed.”
 
Donna turned around to retort, but Josh was gone. Turning once more, she hugged the animal to her chest once more. She would not give up hope. Her son was alive, and she would find him.
 
Back inside the room, the psychic took out a bottle and drank deeply, before resting his face in his hands, hoping beyond hope that the child was found alive.

**********

It was three days later.
 
The body had been found in the river. Decay had done its damage already, though the boy was still identified easily enough. He had died painlessly, as far as the authorities could figure. But it didn’t change the fact that he was dead.
Donna sat on her couch, eyes void of emotion, as she unconsciously clutched the teddy bear to her chest. No more tears ran down her face, though she did tremble slightly, as if the sobs wished to escape. So many times she had heard stories of dramatic rescues and last-second escapes. Nobody publicized stories of defeat. Then again, nobody wanted to talk about it either.
 
It didn’t matter though. Her son was dead.
 
Josh stood at the door, watching her. His stoic face betrayed no emotion, although he had to swallow the lump in is throat several times. Quietly, he closed the door, leaning his back against the wooden frame and letting out a soft sigh. Nobody deserved to go through this. And though he hated to see his closest friend hurt, there was nothing he could do to bring her son back.
 
Donna turned as her friend entered the room, a small smile gracing her features. Turning, she leaned her back against his frame once he sat down, resting her head in the crook of his neck. She had always felt safer around Josh, ever since she was little. He had grown to become her surrogate brother in many ways. But today, she felt no comfort. Her son was dead.
 
Josh brought his arm protectively around Donna, allowing her to lean against him. She wasn’t crying, wasn’t feeling, and that worried him.
 
“Are you going to be ok?”
 
Donna smiled a bit once more at her friends question. Josh was never one to beat around the bush. And he deserved an honest answer. “I don’t know.”
 
“Life is still worth living. There are still people who care about you.”
 
Donna closed her eyes. “I don’t know if it is, Josh. He is gone. I don’t know about anything any more.”
 
The complete lack of emotion in her voice scared Josh. His mind racing, he tried once more. “Your son loved you. And he
knew that you loved him.”
 
“The last time I saw him, we had a fight,” Donna said, her voice threateningly calm. “I never got to apologize. And I never got to say goodbye.”
 
Josh closed his eyes. He hated his idea. But it was the only way he knew right now how to keep her alive.
 
 
The psychic re-read the same paragraph in his book for the umpteenth time. In his head the news of the boy’s death haunted him. He felt pain, sorrow and fear. Mostly fear. The boy had been dead a week. She would figure it out.
Looking up, he jumped slightly as he saw the dark-clad man standing before him. The psychic recognized Josh, the one who was so close to Donna. The one who had never believed him in the first place. The smaller man swallowed nervously.
 
“I know you lied. I know you are fake.”  Josh’s face stayed neutral, but his eyes burned with hatred for this man. “I am willing to make you a deal. Don’t screw it up.”
 
The psychic wrung his hands slightly, trying to keep his composure. “And what, exactly, is this deal?”
 
Josh’s glare deepened, and he motioned the man to follow him.
 
 
Donna sat, her arms outstretched, as the smaller man took her hands in his. Between them sat the teddy bear. He murmured something, swaying slightly, and softly spoke. “Mama? Mama, is that you?”
 
Donna’s face lit up, and a tears sprung to her closed eyes. “Yes, its me. Its mama,” she breathed, barely able to contain the emotion in her. Color returned to what was previously an almost grey face, and she smiled for the first time in days.
 
Josh turned and shut the door, unable to watch the event any longer. In his heart, he hated the small man. The dead were dead. You couldn’t talk to them. There was no such thing as a psychic.
 
Turning, he walked silently down the halls, looking out the windows periodically to the snow continuing to coat the ground. He had done what he had to do, to help his friend. He hated to lie to her. He hated even more to let the psychic deceive her once again. But he did what he had to do to keep her alive. That was the responsibility that came with being her friend.

It's about a German soldier from WWI. Enjoy.

Prologue:

Face down. Face down. Not face up. Face down. Didn't scream or anything. Just dropped. Stone cold. I tried to save him, but he was bleeding too hard. Straight through the jugular. Dead.

Chapter 1:

2 days earlier…

""The front line?""

""Yep.""

""But we've only been here for a couple days!""

""Well, you won't miss it then.""

I couldn't believe it. The front line. The big one. No more wallowing in the reserves, doing boring training. We were going to the big show. 
""So, Alan, how long for?""
""2 weeks, then they rotate us out""
""Only 2 weeks?""
""Yep. Pack your things.""
Alan was on his bed, packing his backpack with all he needed. I was still processing this new knowledge. After a few seconds, I put my pack on my bed and began to pack.

Chapter 2:

The front line…
Our ride to the front was uneventful, except for the constant pounding of artillery, but that eventually faded into background noise. When we got there, we were directed to our trenches under an iron sky of guns, grenades and bullets. 
Apparently, the enemy were making a push towards us. At one point, they came about 10 metres away from our trench and we could see the whites of their fear-stricken eyes. I killed my first man that day. Got him in the stomach, then finished him off when he sank to his knees. The charge broke a few moments afterwards, with men running as fast as they could back to their trenches. 
About a quarter of them actually made it back. The rest lay dead or dying in various amounts of pain, strewn around the battlefield like discarded toys. The one I shot had apparently been one of the enemies braver officers, and people were calling me things like ""Hero"" and ""Saviour"". 

Someone told me that the person I shot had been leading the charges for months on end and that we lost lots of men whenever he was at the head of a charge. 
""Now he's gone"", he stated, ""We'll have that trench within the week, you mark my words!""

Chapter 3:

The next day…
Alan thought that what I'd done was pretty heroic, too. He patted me on the back like everybody else. I felt like shit. I couldn't see what I had done as a good thing. I'd killed a man. Sure, he had been killing our men too, but he was a hero to the enemy. I'd killed one of their greatest inspirations. If any of those men, in that trench not too far from ours, survived, they would be reduced to emotional wrecks. Not just from losing a great hero, but from the war itself. I'd seen it already, on our side. Veterans walking around, almost trance-like, probably trying to remember a happier time, like before the war. Or their 10th birthday. They had lost touch with reality. That's what any sane soldier fears. Not the cold, dark embrace of death, or the pain, but the sight. The feel. The loss of what you think the world is, stripped away until there is-
""Sam?""
I snapped out of it. I realised I was drooling from lack of concentration. Oh feth, I thought. Is it already happening? Surely not this fast?
""Sam?"" Alan repeated. I was aware now.
""Yeah, Alan?""
""We're moving up-trench""
""Really? Why?""
""Logistics apparently thought that losses would be much higher, so the trench is overcrowded. We need to move up in case of bombardment, or it gets too hard to fight.""
That made a lot of sense. ""How much did Logistics misestimate by?"" I asked.
""Well, word from the rabble is that they thought we'd lose the same amount as all the other times, 'cos of that officer you killed. They thought the casualties would be up in the hundreds""
I stared at him, wide-eyed with shock. Had that one man been that inspiring? Could one man really make other men fight with such fervour and fury that his death is the tipping point in a battle?""
These thoughts were at the forefront of my mind as we packed our meagre belongings up and moved up the trench, to the heavier fighting.



Final Chapter:

The next day, I had had an epiphany.
I was that man, now.
I was the hero that all the other men were inspired by.
I could make them fight with the fury and strength of a million men, when we were only a few thousand.
Word had already spread to the other trenches. I was Slayer der Götter, who was already a figure of legend.
 It showed how low morale had been, for me to be elevated to such a high status without being an officer or commander. 

These men would follow me to hell and back.

Suddenly, the was a clamour rising from the trench. Men were shouting orders to get ready. We were going to assault the enemy trenches. I looked around. About a dozen men were looking my way, as if I was going to lead them. As soon as the sirens went, I knew I had no choice. I clambered up the trench line with Alan by my side. We were best friends, nothing could stop us.
The few trees in our way provided a little cover from the withering, inaccurate fire coming from the other trench. We had 20 meters to go.
18.
15.
11.
Then, out of nowhere, Alan dropped. 
Face down. Face down. Not face up. Face down. Didn't scream or anything. Just dropped. Stone cold. I tried to save him, but he was bleeding too hard. Straight through the jugular. Dead.
My fury was taken to new heights. I grabbed his bayonet from the end of his rifle. I had two in my hands. One to murder and one to avenge. I sprinted the final 10 meters with a war cry on my lips. The men around me did the same.
Then, I was among them. Swinging wildly. It was all a blur of stabbing, ripping, killing, swinging, screaming, blood, death, stamping. 
I stopped. The men I had killed were strewn about me, in various states of mutilation. I sprinted around the trench corner.
And I saw him. Death was 20 years old or so, clad in the combat gear of the enemy, bearing a rifle. I stared Death down the barrel of his gun, and didn't flinch when he claimed me.

The moon hung in the air, silvered and shining like a freshly minted quarter. The wind blew lightly over the fruited vineyard. A lone man could be seen walking the rows, inspecting the fruit of his hard labor under the pale moon light. His eyes were shown brightly, even more so than the moon, as he caressed the little grape leaves, plucking and pruning those that stood out as he walked.

In the east, there was a flash of light followed by the rumble of its thunder. The old man's head whipped from its admiration of the vines to survey the coming storm. The wind gusted, nearly knocking him over as he turned. And in the distance, but moving quickly, he could see it. A broad funnel of cloud was touching down.

Terror struck his wrinkled face, twisting it into a ghastly shape. He ran back to the little cottage on the hill as fast as his legs could carry him. His plump little wife, sitting in her lounging chair near the fire let out a sharp scream as he burst through the entryway. Without saying a word, he grabbed her and in a flash they were back outside. She too saw the horror that was whipping itself ever closer, and tried with all her might to stay close to her husband.

He flung open the doors of the wine cellar just as the cyclone reached the field. His wife hurried down the stairs while the little old wine maker looked back over his livelihood, said a silent prayer, and closed the door behind himself.

The cellar door rattled and rumbled as the fierce gales passed over the farm, trying with all their might to rip the door from its frame and hinges. Then it was gone.

The little old man and his wife opened the doors and witnessed the wreckage that remained. The house in shambles, with its roof pried away from the walls, and the vines of the field ripped from their rows and cast about in all directions.

In the center of the field, shining in the pale moonlight, stood a single grape vine.

The weathered man ran with all his might, grapes squishing under his feet as he flew to the vine. With hands now wet from rain and purple from his ruined crop, he reached out to inspect the vine. It clung tightly to the posts that were driven into the ground, its little tendrils wrapped fast around the wire fencing between the posts, and a single cluster of grapes swinging gently in the breeze.

He reaped his diminutive harvest, popped a single grape against the roof of his mouth, and as the juice flowed over his tongue, he could taste every hard days work in a blistering sun, and it was sweet. 

He cried silently as he shared the small knot of grapes with his wife, thankful for what he had.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1347300465.0,,,True,t3_zmr91,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/zmr91/purple/,

He sits on a bench with his back to the wall, head tilted back, resting on the cold granite wall behind him. He is very tired, but so is everyone else. The wall opposite him is made entirely of glass – large panes, fitted together with thin, silver beams, each with a thin strip of clear glue-covered paper applied to the backside. “That stuff could stop a car in its tracks,” he thinks. The panes slant upwards and around the building, creating a dome made entirely of glass. He can see the outside sky – instead of just the stark light that continuously radiates him for the rest of the day. He’s very used to that light, but sometimes the light from outside seems almost…calming. What it would be calming him of, he doesn’t know. He’s always calm. As he looks up, the pale clouds skitter across the light blue sky, and he feels himself start to smile. He stops.

Looking down, he sees the tops of the other buildings around him, and for an unknown reason, longs to go outside. He stops.

He had that feeling once before, and he had quickly driven the thought from his mind. The light from outside comes in at slants, leaving a striped pattern on the wall from the shadow of each metal beam in the seams of the windowed wall. Mesmerizing. The cold, granite bench is beginning to warm under his body. Everything here is granite. If he had never been here before he wouldn’t have known there was a bench there. But he knows. His partner knows. They all know.

As he leans his head back against the wall, he sighs. He can hear her voice now – it’s as if she’s sitting right beside him, whispering into his ear: “Time’s up,” she says.

He stands and quickly walks through the awning to his right, into a large, open room filled with granite desks, and sits down across from his partner and secretary, who then put down their pens and leave through the same awning.

1630. That’s the name.

He begins to fill out his next form:
	Name:Julius Fletcher Simms
	Age:	82
	DOB:	1/12/4010
	ETD:	16:00 hr.
	Reasoning:	Resisting arrest; uncooperative; detriment to society.
	Previous Prof.:	Literature Professor
“All those old teachers. They think they’re so important.” He had shot him twice in the chest and once in the head. “They think they’re trying to ‘restore’ something.

They’re wrong.”

He puts the pile of papers into the bin, and then looks on his computer screen. All of them are there, so he presses send, and his paperwork is done. She speaks again:
“Listen up. Dispatch three. 32 Rothel Ave., 6’4’’, balding. 33 Rothel Ave., clear.”

He was already leaving, 1630 by his side. He had perfected putting on his gear a long time ago. They both had. They had been partners a long, long time. Apply C1 on the head, C2 to the face, T1 to chest, T2 and T3 to left and right shoulders. A1 goes to onto his pelvis, A2 and A3 onto his thighs, A4 and A5 onto his shins, all in that order. His boots are always on. His belt is always organized. He always wears his flexweave underlay. His gun is always loaded. He never misses a step.

They arrive at the building. They walk to the door, knock, and then wait.
“Visors down.”
Knock again, wait.
“3”
Knock.
“2”
Knock.
“1”
“Engage.”
He kicks in the door easily, the flexweave underlay systematically stimulating his muscles, tripling his strength and reaction speed.
Room one. “Clear.”
Room two. “Clear.”
Room three. He fires first.
“Section one complete. Proceeding to Section Two.”
Their voices resound simultaneously, reporting to the voices in their ears.
They leave, stepping quickly over the cooling body, and go to the next building.
He hadn’t realized until that moment that he recognized this road. He walks up the stairs, knocks on the door. Why does he know this place?
Knocks again, waits.
He can see through the glass door.
Knocks. “Three.”
The first room is filled with pictures.
Knocks. “Two.”
The pictures are familiar.
Knock. “One.”
This is my house.
“Engage.”

I kick down the door.

Room one. “Clear.”

Room Two. I shot first. Her body crumpled, bloody. Four holes in her chest steaming from the highly charged incendiary rounds that passed through, leaving large splats of blood on the photograph behind her. She wasn’t surprised when she died.

Her voice in my ear commended my aim, and urged my continuation.

That’s me and her at the beach. Tiffany? Trisha? What is her name again?
Room Three. We both hesitate. A boy is sitting in a chair, reading. Books on chemistry, physics, and mathematics.

“You are to be a lawyer. Not a scientist.”
No, not him. I can’t pull the trigger. I can’t. He’s… James? He’s…mine. My James.
The boy looks up into his father’s eyes.
“I want to be a doctor. Daddy, you said I could be whatever I wanted. James, can I please be a doctor?”
“What? My name isn’t James. Your name is James! My name is Expedited Secrecy Unit #1242, special unit.""

I’m going to shoot him.

The glass pane behind the boy overlooks the sloped hillsides – grassy and cut short, uniformly; the sun setting over the bay plunges the clouds into a sea of reds and purples. The whole pane fills with cracks from the one charge that passed through, the smart-glass expands and shrinks so fast it can’t fill all its own holes, creating a spider web-like array of hairline cracks, misted with blood. No screams. The area in a 6-inch radius from the hole oozes red, and the boy lies on his back, arms flung wide from the impact of hitting the ground.

A familiar, sizzling stench wafts under my visor. There is one hole in his forehead.
No screams.

We turn and leave. “You and me – we’re good,” you say.
We’re the best.
The house next-door is already burnt to the ground. Men in red suits and helmets are coming toward my house, brandishing the flamethrowers.

“2 minutes, 37 seconds. Mission complete. Below average time,” she whispers, excitedly.
That’s another page and a half of paperwork.
I hate paperwork.
I’m going to scream. You think I’m feeling ill, and ask me about it.
But no. I’m fine. Fine.

But I am going to scream.
You hear me start screaming. A silver tear hits my boot.
“Stop it,” you say. “I’m telling you to stop!”
“1242, begin deactivation.” I'm so happy that hers will be the last voice I hear.

I fall on my knees. You turn to me. You point your gun at my head. My visor raises itself, and my head plating parts. There is no protection for cowards.

“Three.”
I’m crying! I’m screaming! My name is James!
“Two.”
How did all of this happen?
“One”
I can’t stop, and I don’t wan-

Open to criticism.,ObeyTheCreed1331,8,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ty69o/opening_to_a_story_i_thought_up_the_other_day/,"   My footsteps echoed across the bare room. The white walls were lined with dirt and grime, leaving me to wonder how a room that lacked walls and windows, could become the dirty, eery looking room that stands before me. I turned my head to the right, and notice a single mirror leaning against the wall at such an angle that I could see my being staring back at me. My red hair was slightly frayed, with the area surrounding the brim of my forehead pointing towards the ceiling as it always does. My face, freckled but strong handsome, had a layer of dust on it as if I had been abandoned in an abandoned room for days. My blue and black flannel shirt drew itself across my torso, and was rolled up at the sleeves. The white undershirt lie matted against my skin, wet with sweat. My blue jeans looked as though I had been rolled around in the dirt for hours, as did my boots. I have always been physically fit, with naturally dense muscle, but I was always too lazy to work-out so I never had the body of Zeus, but still I was well-built.

   As I turned to look away from the mirror, it seemed as though my reflection continued to stare at me, un-phased and unchanged. My gaze returned to my reflection, which was following my every move once again. I must have been imagining it, I thought to myself as I turned to walk around the room. 

   I approached the wall on my left and noticed something that I hadn't seen before. Dirty handprints lie sprawled against the wall, from the ceiling to the wood floors. Grimy footprints faced the wall, and as I crouched down to examine them, another footprint appeared, facing the opposite direction. Surprised, I fell back onto my rear as another print appeared about a stride's length from the other. I stood quickly and followed the footsteps as they traversed to the center of the room, then turned to face the mirror, momentarily resting before finishing its trek towards the reflective glass. When the footprints reached the mirror, I glanced up at my reflection, to try and determine exactly what had just happened. 

   My eye caught a movement at the bottom of the mirror, the footprint had made another move. The heel of the print was stamped into the ground just before the mirror, but the other half... the other half continued into the mirror, as if it never existed. It travelled across the floor being reflected by the mirror. I almost wanted to attempt to go test to see if it was stable myself...

  ""It's as real as you are."" My voice entered my ears, but they did not exit through my lips, where could it be coming from... I looked up to see my reflection staring at me. His lips moved freely as he used my voice. ""This world is filled with wonders. Even some you can't explain. Sometimes, you just need to take a leap of faith, and see what comes of it. After all, the brave don't live forever, but the cautious don't live at all."" 

   My hand reached out to touch the glass, but as my fingers touched the reflective surface, my hand passed through it, the reflection rippling as if it were a liquid. I took a step through into this mirrored world. I took a step into this new world, and walked across the identical room. I turned towards my reflection, but he wasn't there, not even in the world I came from. I felt the world begin to shake, and a deafening sound of laughter filled my ears. The violent quake caused me to topple over, and my body hit the ground...




My eyes bolted open to see three of my friends standing above me with a can of shaving creme in on of their hands. I felt the creme slide off my face. ""Really guys?"" was all I could say after that dream. ""Ah come on, you know we love you,"" my bestfriend Michael said with a smirk.

It's based on real events. The story is pretty dialogue heavy and I didn't think too hard about the narrative. Nonetheless I hope some of you enjoy it.


Mollified

“This is gonna be so awk.”

“Why?”

“I dunno. I haven’t talked to Julia in a while. Plus I don’t think I’m gonna be sad enough. And I’m worried it’ll be obvious.”

“Claire it’s fine. None of that matters. We’re just there to signal to her that we care enough about her grief that we’re willing to sacrifice a few hours of our time.”

“Yeah I suppose. I’m just really bad at this stuff.”

I pressed my forehead against the window and watched a cute girl walking her dog. She noticed me staring because traffic was moving so slowly. I mouthed “cute dog” and she smiled. I had no idea if she knew what I was saying.

“Is it bad that I’m bored already?” Claire asked, glancing over to observe my reaction.

“Nah, it’s normal. Just be on your best behavior.”

“Yes daddy,” she replied with the bubbliest of mirth.

“You’re incorrigible.”

After 22 years, I had yet to encounter death on a personal level. It was more of a curiosity to me than anything real. And yet I felt bad that we were making light of the situation. The closest I’d ever gotten to death was back in high school when the doctor suspected my mom had a tumor and wanted to run a scan. The night before her appointment I imagined the worst and listened to some crappy punk bands, shedding silent tears. But that was quickly forgotten when the doctor found nothing wrong. I never experienced real human mortality.

“Andrew, would you be sad if I died?”

“You know I would be.”

“Well I wouldn’t want you to be. Cause at the rate I’m going I’ve probably already peaked. You know me. Live fast, die young.”

She’s only 20.

“I know, Claire. I’d still be sad. Maybe less so for you as you are and more so for who you could’ve become.”

“Too real.”

“I meant it in the least judgmental way possible.”

“I know.”

We finally arrived at the colonial looking home, finding the parking lot filled with tens of cars. I wondered how many cars would attend my wake. Probably a couple handfuls at best. As we pulled in I made sure to turn down the car radio that had been blasting Kanye West with maxed bass. My hand found Claire’s as we walked in. I remembered that she had recently begun dating some guy but neither of us seemed to care.

As I walked in I was reminded of a cocktail party. Groups of people, seemingly separated by age group, stood in circles and chatted. We walked around and eventually came across the body. She was seated upright. White dress, eyes shut. Claire and I shared a glance. I felt her squeeze my hand sharply. We both turned simultaneously to leave the room. Julia came to greet us and give us hugs, but we didn’t know what to say beyond the basic pleasantries. She related to us that everything still felt like a dream. Apparently her mom passed away out of the blue for no discernible reason. Claire stroked Julia’s hair and gave her a peck on the forehead. Julia thanked us profusely for coming and told us she was going to head upstairs for a bit and would be back soon. I could see that her composure was beginning to crack as she hastened away.

Claire and I continued to explore the house. We came across a table of small cards, each decorated with a photo of Julia’s mom on the front and a portrait of the Virgin Mary on the back. Mass-produced mementos for the guests. I stood and stared at Mary. Her heart was drawn on the exterior of her body.

“Hey Claire, check out her heart. It looks just like a strawberry.”

Claire exploded with laughter and I struggled to contain my own at her reaction. An older gentleman who stood across the room glanced in our direction. We must have looked mortified and he must not have heard my comment because he walked over, placing his hands on our shoulders.

“No need to be ashamed. We all respond to grief in our own ways, whether through tears, confusion, or laughter.”

I offered him a solemn nod and thanked him for understanding.

“Can we step outside?” asked Claire.

I agreed, thinking it for the best. We walked to Claire’s car and sat inside, reclining our seats. The sun was at an angle such that the shadow cast by my hand was enormous. I made spirit fingers, watching the massive, flailing shadow and Claire laughed. In the company of anyone else I would’ve felt dumb.

“We should probably go back in at some point and say bye to Julia before we leave,” Claire bemoaned.

“Yeah.”

“I feel somewhat bad suggesting this, but do you wanna roll? And by roll I mean molly, not roll as in bounce.”

I chuckled to myself. She would.

“Sure. I guess I will out of solidarity. And I guess I’d be pretty miz if you rolled and I didn’t.”

Feeling like a social deviant, I shared the small pouch of licorice smelling powder with Claire, tasting the bitterness as it crept from the front of my gums to the back of my tongue. I noted that the bitter taste reflected our moods. Claire plugged in her ipod and rested her head on my shoulder. Her hair smelled natural, like petrichor. I closed my eyes and listened to her breathe to the rhythm of the music. I might have fallen asleep for a short time but the next thing I realized was the molly kicking in. The surfaces where our skins met tingled lightly and the music was much richer than I remembered. Claire’s phone buzzed. She had gotten a text from Julia thanking us for stopping by and apologizing for disappearing for so long. That took care of that.

“You know, I still can’t figure out if we’re immature or too mature for our years.”

I ruminated over her words for a moment.

“I’m not entirely sure I understand the word mature, or that I like it. I think we’re just intellectual anomalies.”

“Or maybe we’re just like everyone else except honest about our real feelings. Or maybe we’re really comfortable with repressing normal feelings.”

“That’s certainly possible.”

“You know, I’d still rather be dating you.”

“I like you a lot too. But we both know it won’t work.”

“Cause we’re too much of the same half. We need to find our other halves a la Plato’s Symposium blah blah blah. Or we’ll get bored quickly. I know. But my statement still stands.”

I impulsively leaned over to kiss her.

“Only because we’re rolling,” she pulled back to clarify.

“Only because we’re rolling,” I confirmed.

We lost ourselves for god knows how long until Claire broke it off. A single tear rolled down her cheek. I didn’t know why.

“I don’t know why either. Life in confusing. Or maybe it’s just the molly,” she explained in response to my questioning gaze.

“Or both.”

“Or both. I’m not sad. At least I don’t think so.”

My eyes started watering as well. Inexplicably. Or perhaps out of empathy.

“I’m not sad either. Maybe we’ve forgotten how to be sad but our tear ducts haven’t.”

“Yeah. Tear ducts sounds so biological though. Let’s go with hearts. Our hearts haven’t forgotten.”

“Our strawberry hearts?”

She laughed.

“Strawberry hearts forever,"" she crooned to the tune of the Beetles.

And we were happy again, fully and deeply.

The sounds of metal against metal reverberated through the entire ship as the captain walked towards the guard rail on the starboard side. Every other step the captains prosthetic leg stuck the ships metal surface and rang out. From just below the knee a metal contraption attached to his leg. Hinges and blots dotted the device and ever few steps a release valve opened and steam hissed out. The device was solid bronze and extremely heavy and as such, it required a lot of strength to take a single step, much less walk across the ship. 
	
He continued his difficult trek until he reached the railing. Leaning against it he looked over to his right and saw one of his passengers staring out across the night sky. She stood there silent, not even noticing the captains presence, completely enthralled by the view in front of her. 
	
“Its beautiful isn’t it?” the captain said, breaking the silence. The female passenger could only manage a nod and did so without breaking eye contact with the view.
	
The captain gave a small chuckle.
	
 “I used to be just like you, the first time I saw all of this” he motioned with his arm, swinging it about. 
	
Hundreds of feet below them the giant city spread out in every direction, seemingly never ending. The snow capped mountains that sat in the center of the city shined as the sun just barely peaked over the tip of the highest peak. The setting sun cast enough light to see the city as it feel asleep. And just enough darkness to see the stars coming to life. Their light brightening the night sky. 
	
“When I first saw it I knew that I would never be able to go back. And I haven’t, I have called this ship home ever since.” the captain said after a few moments of silence. 
	
The female passenger pointed down to the ships running through the rivers that cut through the city. and spoke for the first time 
	
“They don’t even know what they are missing.” she said almost in shock. 
	
“And that is the way of things, you never really know what you are missing until you have held it in your hands and you wonder were has it been your entire life.” The captain sighed. 
	
“I have meet so many river boat captains who say that airship travel is impractical and unorthodox and unsafe. They neglected to mention it is beautiful.” 
	
“The airship is a relatively new invention, compared to boats. New is scary, and new is confusing. They say that only the foolish mess with the scary and confusing.” he gave a quick laugh “And as such, I am a fool among fools.” 
	
The passenger looked at the captain and asked him.
	
“How did you first come to fly on this ship?” she asked.
	
“Ah.” he sighed “Now there is a story. Have you ever heard of Jeremiah the Mad?” the captain say the lack of recognition on the passengers face and continued. “I assumed as much, he was way before your time. Anyways, Jeremiah was a captain like I am myself on board a very similar vessel such as this one. Only he was not a captain of a passenger vessel, he was a thief and a murder and was greatly feared through out the water district.” the captain paused for a moment and took a deep breath. 
	
“I suppose you can see were this story is going, my family owned a shipping company. The Eastern Trading Company as it was called back then. My family has just commissioned the build of a new line of passenger ships and the first one was ready for its maiden voyage.” the captain stopped once again and leaned against the railing, his mechanic leg hissing. 
	
“My father thought is was a good idea if my family and I were on board the ship for its voyage. The first night of the voyage the ship was attacked and boarded by Jeremiah the Mad and his crew. We fought back and they killed my family. I lost my leg.” He raised his mechanic leg as he said this, then continued his story.
	
“I was twelve years old.” he said quietly. The passenger next to him stood staring with her eyes wide open.
	
“Oh my god I am so sorry!” she exclaimed. The captain gave a small smile. 
	
“The past is the past, no use feeling sorry for what already happened” he said. The passenger stood silent, not 
saying a word. The captain then turned and started to limp away. Click, clack. Click,  clack. As he walked away the passenger realized he never answered her question. 
	
“wait!” she yelled “you never answered, how did you come to fly on this ship?” 
	
The captain stopped and turned around to face her. 
	
“But I did tell you, you are standing on the ship that used to belong to Jeremiah the Mad.” he said.
	
“What?” she said in shock. “how did you get his ship?” 
	
“That is a story for another time.” he answered. He turned and continued to walk away, leaving her in absolute shock. As he walked away he spoke over his shoulder.
	
“Best be getting under shelter, a storm is picking up” he said as he disappeared under the deck. 	
	
The passenger just stood in shock watching the captain disappear. She turned and faced the guard rail and ran her hand over it, whipping dust off it. Something caught her eye. Looking down she could faintly see a symbol scathed into the railing. It read.

The sun beat down on the dry land, blazing brilliantly against a perfect blue sky.  The earth was dead and flat―every weed and insect choked with death by the toxic dust that had settled over the land.  The air was hot and stagnant.  

A long time passed.  

Eventually a far, distant sound emerged.  This sound slowly grew until it became a muffled roar―carried from miles away across the infinite flatness.  This sound was shortly accompanied by a black speck on the horizon, a long cloud of dust billowing in its wake.  
Jedediah shifted uncomfortably in his seat and flicked his cigarette butt out the window of the jeep.  His eyes, shaded from the blinding light by a pair of dark red sunglasses, drifted lazily across the wasteland before him.  There wasn’t much to see.  There never was.  After three years, Jedediah was beginning to reconsider the job offer that he had jumped at just a few short years ago.  What had promised adventure and danger had become merely one long and tedious journey after another, and they were only getting longer.  At 26, he had already seen more than most members of the commune would in their entire lives.  Not that they were missing much, as far as Jedediah was concerned.  It was just wasteland as far as you cared to go.  Still, he couldn’t deny that he treasured this freedom.  It was boring as hell, sure, but out in the wastes there wasn’t nobody to tell him what to do, none of them narrow-eyed shopkeepers or stupid old men with their stupid talk.  The wastes alone were his master.  The long empty miles gave him a sense of momentum in his life, even though he was really no freer than the rest of the commune and was doomed to die just like the rest of them.  Deep down Jedediah realized this, and unconsciously he hated himself for it.  He longed for a life that he could never imagine, a life that did not exist and had not existed for many long spans of time.  
Yet it was this distant and long-forgotten past that the people of the commune were utterly and completely dependent upon.  Scattered throughout the wastes were isolated vaults buried within the earth.  Their dark steel depths betrayed little about their unknown creators, and all were identical in shape and mystery.  Upon entering, one would be overwhelmed by the staggering immensity of their age, and the power and sophistication surely wielded by their creators.  

They defied the land, plunging indiscriminately into the bowels of the earth through soil and stone without any heed for the natural order.  How unlike the communes above, which clung desperately to every rock and stone and were subject to all the violent whims of earth and sky.  The survivors of the wastes, lacking any other defining feature upon which to settle, inevitably grew their towns upon the ancient relics which protruded from the surrounding plain.  

 Shapaw, the easternmost commune, was where Jedediah lived. Hajiik was to the west and Guln in the north.  The two southern communes, Apette and Illicagh, were rumored to have starved or fallen to some other similarly horrific fate, as no news had reached Shapaw of either in quite some time.  Even Shapaw, the largest of the communes, contained less than five hundred residents.  Some of the others contained scarcely enough people to merit a name at all.  

More than once some crazy band of fools had gone and tried to live inside one of the vaults, but the dampness and the creeping blackness inevitably drove anyone inside to madness.  Most of the vaults, however, had not been touched by human hands for a long, long time.  Their dark tomb-like caverns were usually braved by only the most fearless and curious of souls, who were invariably rewarded with a treasure-trove of strange and useful relics, the most valuable of which was a tiny blue pill.  This pill alone kept the communes alive, for without the medicine within them, the people of the wastes―should they breath so much as a mote of the toxic dust―would be writhing on the ground in minutes.  It was a violent and agonizing death.  All efforts to learn the secrets of the blue pills had failed, and the people had resigned themselves to a life dependent upon them.  

As plentiful as the pills were, they would not last forever.  After a time, the supply beneath the streets of Shapaw had been exhausted, and so it became necessary to send someone out into the wastes to gather more.  These men became responsible for the resupplying of the pills by way of finding and raiding the surrounding vaults which had not already been robbed of their contents.  

Jedediah checked his compass, then craned his head back to gauge the position of the sun.  Sixteen degrees southwest and just about high noon.  He scowled.  At this rate he’d have to spend the night in the back seat of the jeep.  The wastes were scorched and burned by day, but the nights were sickly cold, and the back of a beat-up old jeep wasn't Jedediah’s idea of a good night’s sleep.  He drove on.  Eventually his thoughts turned to other things: the girl at Begunn’s who was always smiling, his busted generator, the price of the replacement part to fix the damn thing, the―

Jedediah suddenly sat up and squinted.  He threw off his sunglasses and rummaged around in the sack on the passenger seat, pulling out a pair of binoculars.

 “About time.”

The grey disk that poked out above the earth could mean only one thing: a vault.  As he drew nearer, the smooth, familiar features of the structure became visible.  It looked the same as every other vault he’d ever seen, but then again, why shouldn’t it?  He decelerated to a crawl, then braked and cut the engine.  Double-checking the contents of the sack, he then slung it over his shoulder, and walked towards the embankment which descended towards the entryway.  The ground crunched beneath his boots.  Now that he wasn’t speeding along at 130mph he could smell once more the subtle sickly aroma of the poisonous dust kicked up beneath his feet.  Jedediah slid down the embankment and came to a halt just before the imposing metal hatchway.  He gripped the hot metal handle and pulled.  After several minutes of strenuous effort, a loud clunk came from within, and the lock fell open.  Jedediah braced his shoulder against the door, and pushed.  The hatchway swung inward with an eerie quietness into the dark chamber within.  Jedediah took out his torch and lit it.  He stepped inside.  

Immediately he sensed that something was different; something was not right.  Although his eyes could see nothing in the darkness, he was overwhelmed by a sensation of immense space.  It was as though he had stepped into the center of a massive subterranean cave, rather than the usual maze of rectangular passageways which he had learned to navigate.  

Jedediah scowled and tightened his grip on the torch.  His right hand moved cautiously to his knife-sheathe, where it stayed, tense.  Glancing out the hatchway, he set off into the dark.  His footsteps made no sound as he moved onward into the chamber.  Nothing but blackness emerged out of the dark, and eventually the open hatchway was nothing more than a pinprick of light in the distance behind him.  Jedediah stopped.  

“HELLO?” he shouted.  A faint echo reverberated around him.

He waited.  Silence.

Suddenly, from above, came a tiny mechanical clinking.  After a moment, it stopped.  Jedediah stood very still.

“Hello.” cooed a soft metallic voice.

“Shit!”  Jedediah leaped backward, starring wide-eyed into the black abyss above him.  “Who's there?  Just who the hell are you?” he demanded.

“I am a Long-Term-Data-Preservation unit.  I have no name.”  Its voice was cool and friendly, yet disturbingly inhuman.  “Who are you?”

He glared at the darkness.  “Jedediah Ackerson.”

“Hello Jedediah.  I have waited a long time to meet you.  I have much to show you.""

The surrounding air slowly became alive with a deep, almost inaudible humming.  Suddenly, the entire chamber exploded with blinding light, and Jedediah slammed his eyelids shut.  After several minutes, his eyes began to adjust to the throbbing brightness.  He cautiously blinked open his eyes, and the sight that met his gaze paralyzed him.  His entire body became frozen in shock, as though he had been turned to stone.  In all of Jedediah’s short life, nothing―not even his most radical fantasies―could have prepared him for this sight.  
The breeze―warm and sweet―played across his cheeks.  The blue horizon sparkled in the brilliant sunlight, and seemed to breathe in and out as it leapt up the sandy stretch below his feet, only to slink back upon itself.  Jedediah blinked.  He stared and blinked and thought no thoughts: a man overcome by the most beautiful thing he would ever see.

""This,"" said the disembodied voice, ""is an ocean.""

The Bloop...

That’s what it was called at the time, The “Bloop” , because I guess we didn’t have anything better to call it. And to be honest, after reviewing the audio several times, it did kinda sound like a bloop. The kinda noise when a large volume of water is displaced all at once. We were lucky on that one, or unlucky. Maybe if we had recognized it for what it was…

I’m getting ahead of myself.

I believe it was the Olmecs that first encountered the phenomena around 1831 BCE. There’s this monument, they call it the San Martin Pajapan Monument now, that was carved in approximately that time period. The statue is early example of their artwork, showing a young lord or demi god, holding up a ceremonial bar. The general consensus is that it was a figure meant to be establishing the center of the universe. What little we can translate of their culture and writing, the statue was placed at a location that they viewed as being a place of powerful energy. Maybe they saw something in the hills between those two volcanoes. Something that defied nature. There’s no fossil or archeological evidence, but it just fits, you know? By working backwards with the math?

The first recorded incident was February 11th, 1373CE outside of what is modern day Baghdad, Iraq. I say this is the first “recorded” incident for a reason. What happened outside of the recovering city was never properly documented. The Il-Khanids, Mongol rulers of their captured Arabian lands, weren’t too keen on writing down things that didn’t involve the glory of the Mongol empire. What can be gleaned from the entire TWO historical documents concerning the event, was a massive shockwave tipped over several ships on the river, as well as toppling dozens of homes within the city. The writings from the era said that a pressure wave, described by them as “the air punched at our chests as if a forceful man ” , originating from the desert sands east of the city. I calculate the epicenter to have been 1 mile east north east of the cities’ harbor, of approximately 63 kilotons of TNT in strength, somewhat less than the destructive threshold of the atomic warhead dropped on Hiroshima by the United States during World War 2. The effects of being so close to a blast of that magnitude would have been similar to what was described by the accounts. I can consequently see why no one cared. It was not a great era of scientific curiosity. It was written off like any myriad of events during that era.

The second recorded event occurred on June 30th, 1908. Centered around 5 miles South South east of Lake Cheko, in Tunguska, Russia. I’m sure you’ve heard of that one, though. What’s more commonly known as, The Tunguska Blast. Up until last month, it was easily attributed to a rogue asteroid or cometoid exploding in mid air over the deserted forest. Official estimates vary, but the explosive force rattled windows 400 miles away. It hammered the Siberian wilds with what we now know was around 2 megatons of explosive force. Speculation was, that had such an event occurred in a populated city in that era, say for instance, Paris, London, or New York City. The death toll would have numbered in hundreds of thousands. We were “lucky” though, it was a deserted location, very few people were injured. Hell it took months for a study team to even venture out into the frozen woodlands to survey the damage back then. Again, No one really cared.

Slightly, I opened my eyes to see a light in the hallway and noticed that there was a lack of warmth by the side of my bed. My wife, Annie must’ve have been tapping, so I went downstairs to figure the situation out. My eyes were still adjusting to the dim light, but I quickly noticed a grisly shadow. It was an unfamiliar figure, it was a bitter looking intruder, and next to him was my wife, cold on the floor. Then the intruder’s black eyes coldly shot mine, and with his rough hands, he shot me. 

A gleam of light shines in my eyes and I quickly rise up. I panic, it seems as though I’ve been in deep slumber for a long time. As I rise up, I pulled on something which went into my skin; it was an IV needle which I detached. Unclear to this situation, I look at my surroundings. My IV bag is completely empty, the Hospital is filled with complete silence and the room is faint. My situation doesn’t seem to make sense, as it seems nothing is operating and no one is working. Quickly, the stood up on my feet but felt as though I would fall a second later, but with enough effort I reached the bathroom. In the view of the dark room, I can see myself through the filthy mirror. It reflected an image of a ghostly pale man with a beard. I could not conclude anything just yet, and needed more information about my situation. I barely manage to jog through the hospital’s mysterious hallway with the only sound being my footsteps and my breath. Why was no one here to care for me? Why was I alone? I quickly grew frustrated as my questions only developed. 

I opened the door at the exit and felt an eerie gust of wind blow at my face. The polluted smell of dead bodies came rushing through my nose, yet I saw no dead bodies. In fact I didn’t see a body in sight, dead or alive. Everything was put at a complete stop. Traffic of cars was abandoned in the middle of streets and a row of stores went unmanaged. Yet I was more abandoned than any car or store as I was completely alone without another human. The cars were kept together by road and stores merged by shared walls. Suddenly, I felt a harsh pressure hit my chest and fell to the ground without much effort.

I opened my eyes to look at the empty world. Then, I saw someone. Someone was alive in this desolated place, and she was coming towards me. Once we met, she told me her name was Anne; she looked familiar but seemed to be in dangerous condition. The massive amount of lipstick on her mouth contrasted with paleness. After an aggressive set of dry coughs, I managed to agree to travel with her.

Clutching his pistol and penlight in hands that were sweaty despite the cool of the underground, the young man stepped over the threshold and held up his light. The narrow beam completely failed to pierce the darkness that began ten meters from Oleg's face. The air was different down here. It didn't seem to want to move. Taking a deep breath despite the musty odor of damp concrete and peeling paint, Oleg began to move down the doorless corridor with short, careful steps. 



Roughly thirty meters in, Oleg came to a junction. A blank wall was before him, the lettering that once directed unknown personnel to the left or right nearly gone. Faced with the oppressive darkness of the subterranean complex, Oleg once again silently cursed his miniscule light. He had long since holstered his pistol, giving up hope of finding even a single rat in these stygian depths. Looking to his right, he could see that the same corridor continued for at least another fifteen meters. Beyond that, his light could tell him nothing. Turning to his left, Oleg froze. Something was wrong with this darkness. He felt an immediate sense of vertigo, which took some time to reconcile with what his eyes could just barely percieve. As far as he could tell, after a few meters, the corridor *ended.* There was no dead end, no long-forgotten storeroom or office. There were no walls at all. It was as if all of it, walls, ceiling, and floor, had been torn away. The blackness simply opened, like a mouth. 



Making no small effort to steady himself, slow his beating heart, Oleg once again drew his pistol. For what reason exactly he couldn't possibly say--simply feeling the smooth grip against his palm was a comfort. He kept his eyes, and the penlight they relied on, trained on the opening in front of him. After a moment, he took a step. Then another. After a few moments, which Oleg's furious heart spun into hours, he stood before the opening. The blackness was like a wall--impenetrable, indestructable, ageless. It took all his nerve not to step back when all his senses screamed that he was walking into something solid. Oleg turned the narrow beam of his light downwards, and this time could not help but quickly step back from the edge--for he now knew he had been standing on a precipice--of a pit. It had been no illusion that drew him in this direction. The walls, ceiling, and floor had been severed--torn away--by some monstrous force. Jagged concrete and rusted, sawtoothed pipes, interspersed with rebar like severed tendons from a limb jutted out over the edge. 



Oleg slowly knelt, pointing his light further downward. After a moment, he could make out a sloped dirt surface, which had eroded away from the ruined floor over the decades, resulting in the drop he saw before him. With this new information, Oleg calculated that it was only a drop of about three-quarters of a meter. His previous fear almost forgotten, Oleg re-holstered his pistol, clutched his sweaty penlight between his teeth, and lowered himself over the precipice, taking care not to cut his hands or legs on the jagged sections of pipe that jutted here and there. He landed on the dirt, his weight causing the slope to crumble further. He slid for a moment before planting his feet and retrieving his light from his mouth. Not wanting to move any further before seeing what lay before him, he played the beam up and down, pointing it away from him. His search revealed a sloped dirt wall about ten meters in front of him, evidently some kind of cave-in blocking him from reaching where the amputated corridor continued. Thus satisfied, Oleg turned to further explore this new area and froze for the third time. Once again, his light disappeared into an impenetrable darkness. Spinning to his left, he had the same result. Clearly, this was some kind of cave, the formation of which had been caused by the same event that shattered the concrete and rebar of the corridor. Pointing his light straight up, Oleg could barely make out a ceiling. It comforted him to have some idea of the dimensions of this cave, even if he had no idea how far it stretched to his left or his right. Picking a direction at random--his left--Oleg began to walk the length of the cave, moving his light from wall to wall to ensure he stayed in the center.



It was several minutes before he realized that his boots were making an entirely different sound as they impacted the dirt than when he had first entered the cave. Where the cave floor had been slightly softened with loose dust and dirt, it was now packed extremely hard, almost solid. Oleg pointed his light straight down as he pressed his boot into the floor of the cave, noticing that it left hardly any print at all in the thin layer of loose, dry dirt coating the hard-packed earth underneath. This was entirely odd. The cave showed every sign of having been created recently, as the result of the same seismic activity that had severely damaged the complex far behind him. However, this kind of packed strata suggested immense pressure, some great weight bearing down. Oleg stopped in his tracks, stomping down hard on the packed earth from time to time and noting the echo it produced. Trying to determine what kind of layering was present in the walls of the cave, Oleg turned his light to the wall and moving it upwards in a straight line, watching carefully for a change in its color, which would signify changed in its geological makeup. What he saw made him reach for his gun. The walls weren't slanted. They curved. There was a single, smooth curve that made the entire wall into a concave depression that met the ceiling and curved down the other side and met on the floor of the cave, where Oleg stood--he saw, now--in a similar shallow depression. This was no cave, then. *It was a tunnel.*



Oleg's heart, already racing by this time, began to pound painfully. His brow felt cold and hot in turns. If this was a tunnel, then who...what had made it? How was such a thing even possible? Oleg's legs began to tremble, but as he tried to calm himself (a vain effort) he realized that it was not his body trembling, but a growing tremor in the earth itself; a vibrating that was becoming more and more pronounced. Oleg spun wildly, in a panic, casting his light jerkily along tunnels walls that now showed signs of trembling, a slight crumbling. 



Then there was the sound. It was the unrelenting, hellish groan of the planet. It was like a million diesel trains, moving along massive tracks and sounding their pressurized whistles in unison. A growing **HOWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM** roared up through the tunnel, shaking Oleg to the smallest cells in his body. His very mind seemed to disintegrate under the force of that rumbling howl of what he was sure had once bored these tunnels. How? How? he thought feverishly, as if to echo that loathsome sound. How could this be? How could this be? An orange glow lit the depths of the tunnel before him, as if the roar of this creature, this monstrous worm had set the stale tunnel air ablaze. The earth shook as if pounded by hammers the size of galaxies. For a moment, Oleg was utterly paralyzed, simply staring into its dozens of fiery eyes. His penlight dropped, useless, to the ground. Then it was upon him, and *THE TEETH...*

He still remembered how the strong timber of the Louisville Slugger felt in his palm. He remembered the special grip he had practiced for it. He remembered the first time he learned what he could do with just  his thick arm muscles and a flick of the wrist, and he remembered how it made him fell. The memories swirled through his mind has he approached the plate with the soft, lifeless plastic toy bat in his hands. He thought back to the countless excited feminine shouts from his college days, the swelling of excitement whenever he approached home plate.

Part of him knew those days were long passed, and part of him refused to believe it. As he got himself ready for his chance at bat he went through the same little rituals he had when he was 20. The same steps, the same routines. He grabbed the base, feeling how much different it felt then he remembered. He had been told the wiffleball bat would be smaller then he was used to from when he was young, but he didn't want to believe it. 

When he felt he was ready, or felt he must have been ready, he looked to his wife. A look of excitement crossed her face like a wild carnality as she let lose a wanton shout. The man she had loved was the confident man with a control in the field. She had often commented on how it felt to see him swing, making the ball go where ever he wanted, however he wanted. When she saw him wielding the thick, heavy wooden bat, when she felt the joy and pleasure it gave her to see him in control, that is what made her fall in love with him. He knew these things to be true.

He waited for the pitcher to do his part. The ball came to him fast, he swung, and missed. He felt a flash of anger raising through his middle-aged frame, then embarrassment. He hid his shame and anger behind a joke, a teasing shrug, as he eyed the crowd again for his wife. She smiled at him, caring but he could read how deflated she was. He clearly saw the grin on her lips; as plastic as it was supportive. He looked up, and through his smile his eyes pleaded: ""I don't know what happened. But it won't happen again. Trust me."" 

He told himself it wasn't his fault. That it was the bat, the empty, souless chuck of plastic that was to blame. He glared at it, his distain expressing itself through his jokes. His smile as hollow as the bat he was carrying. He did what he could to shake it off. It was perfectly natural and happened to everybody at some point, but still a haunting, cold knot was growing in his stomach. A worry was growing, festering under the surface of his mind. He swallowed hard to ignore it, tried again, swung and missed.

He didn't joke. He wasn't angry. And he didn't look around at first. He couldn't blame the ball, the bat or the pitch. He could only blame himself. He knew in his heart that he was the problem, that he wasn't the man he was anymore, and if he wasn't bat-swinger, the star hitter, the man who could knock it out of the park every night, then what was he? Was he even a man at all? He didn't know, and he didn't want to find out. He wanted to hide. He felt shame. He felt ashamed and enraged at himself for making himself ashamed and he wished desperately his shame wasn't a public shame.

Again he looked to his wife. He tried to read the look on her face, but he couldn't see her. The more he looked for her, the more he saw a petite brunette staring at her feet. Her hair dangled in front of her, and his heart sank when he could see a hint of a blush. She was ashamed of him, he knew she was, and he couldn't blame her. Her friends would ask how she was doing, and she would tell him. They would discuss his failure with the sly, cool detachment that they discussed everything else. She would laugh with her friends in an amused, ironic way then, but for now she seemed crestfallen. He knew she remembered how he used to be, and he wished more then anything she didn't have to see him like this.

He stood frozen in his own thoughts, when a voice broke his trance. First one then several people shouted to continue the game; that he was taking to long. He had to continue now or admit the truth, to himself and everyone. To admit that he was a failure. To admit that he wasn't what he pretended to be. He didn't want to continue, he didn't want to try again. He wanted to curl up for a long time by himself. Suddenly he thought of his father. He knew his Father would be ashamed of him too. He knew his father would already have made it all around the bases by now. His father would have made everybody cheer. His father would have made his wife happy.

The crowd was turning sour. They had been whipped into a frenzy and demanded satisfaction. The pleas to continue had become stern shouts to finish his turn at bat, or to get off the field. He sighed to himself, and took his position again. He didn't believe it would work, but he knew what was expected of him. He went through the same motions he always did. He did his part; the thing that defined him. The little dances that made him what he was, even though he was still doubting his own abilities. He lifted the soft bat in his hands, his fingers wrapped around it, hoping that maybe a new stance or trick would suddenly turn him back into the man he was before. He swung, he missed.

He expected boos from the crowd. He expected not to be allowed back into the safety of the dugout. As he left home plate, he dragged the bat behind it, wanting nothing more than to drop it and never have to look at it again. But he still dragged it behind him, like it was somehow attached to him. When he looked up, he looked for his wife, only to see her giggling as she spoke to her friend's nephew. She smiled at the 19 year old college football player, her lips pulled back as she softly squeezed his arm. The younger man, for his part, all buffed chest and bravado seemed excited by the attention. She didn't look back at him the entire trip to the little chain-link trench where his teammates were.

He sat down in a slump, but felt better in the dark of the bench. His teammates, the ones he felt would be the hardest on him, were all very polite, and friendly. The fear he had of their disapproval disappeared. They told him they understood. It had been a long time, after all, and that it happens to everyone, sometimes. They didn't reject him, they accepted him. They had something they could commiserate over.

I knew I hadn’t literally been hit by a train, but in all my twelve years of existence i had never felt something that painful. He had said it wouldn’t hurt, but he lied. 

   ""That one was a little high"", he said. 

   ""Yes sir"", was all i could manage to reply.

   That rifle had a hell of a kick. I rubbed my shoulder to try and comfort my bones as they screamed in protest. My step father had promised to take me hunting but now i was having second thoughts. 

   His name is John David Adams Senior. He has been married to my mom for the last two years. It wasn’t strange to me, having a new dad, like it was to most people. That’s mostly because i never had an old dad. For as long as I can remember it’s just been me and my mom. He is a nice man, although he can be very strict at times.

  We got up from the old wooden bench set up on the outskirts of a field about two hundred yards from our camp, and walked towards the bullseye I had been aiming for. 

  The crisp mid-December air felt amazing, like a cold blanket kissing my face. As we walked, the smell of gunpowder that had saturated the air slowly dwindled away, and was replaced by the sweet aroma of freshly cut grass.

  As we reached the target, I felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. He had been right. The hole was nowhere near where I had been aiming for, but it was only my first shot, and we had a whole case of bullets to go through. As we walked back to the bench I rubbed my arm again, apologizing for the pain that was to come.

  Fifteen shots and a short ride later we arrived back at the camp to plan out my first hunt. Our camp was an old house in Natchez, Mississippi that had been converted into a hunting camp by a group of men Mr. John had befriended. From the outside, it looked like hell. The walls had boards missing and the roof patched in spots with sheets of tin, but from the inside it wasn’t half bad. 

  As we walk through the front door into the living room I pass the huge map of the property that is used to show everyone where we would be the following day. “You see that spot there, number 24?” He asked.

  I replied “Yes sir.”

  “That’s where we will be tomorrow.”

  I woke the next morning to the sound of the alarm screeching like a fire engine alerting us to a new day. My bed was a sanctuary, a place to relax, but it was time to embrace the day and face the trials that were to come. 

  As i pulled on my gear i glance at the clock and realize it is only four in the morning. That explains the iron gates that had replaced my eyelids constantly trying to slam shut.


  The ride to the stand was dark and quiet. Not in a frightening way though. it put me in a calm and comfortable mood. I could almost feel the forest surrounding me waiting for the sun to rise and give light to the new day, and the new events that would unfold. 

  We parked on the road and walked to the stand, being as quiet as possible so as to not alert whatever was lurking in the dark trees. We are now predators, and somewhere, hidden behind a curtain of foliage, is my prey awaiting its fate.

  There are two chairs in the stand, each facing out a window that gave a full view of the two fields below. The fields were perpendicular to each other and connected in the corners, that is where our stand is set up. I positioned one chair so i could have a full view of each side at all times. 

  As the sun slowly rose to its seat in the sky, the field came into view and revealed the life brimming below. I see chipmunks and birds going about their morning activities, but i see no deer.

  An hour or two goes by with no luck. My nose is starting to freeze when Mr. John taps me on the shoulder and points towards the field I was looking at. I didn’t see anything though, but readied my rifle anyway, just as he has taught me. 

  Slowly, a deer creeps its way onto the field and I feel my heart begin to race. I let the animal come closer before preparing for the kill. Steadily I lower my head to the stock and gaze through the scope. 

  My heart is leaping out of my chest, but i breathe deeply to attempt to calm it down.

  “Breathe out and squeeze,” he whispers.


  As the air escapes my lungs I slowly squeeze the trigger and ready myself for the impact. The world seems to slow down and disappear, leaving only me and my prey.

  Inside the scope that became my entire universe in that half a second, I hear the click of the hammer against the bullet then almost instantaneously the world explodes back to life. I see the birds flying in every direction, frightened by the sound of the shot, and in the very center of the field, lying still and lifeless, i see my target.

  We left the stand to see how I did. As we come upon the animal i feel pride for what I had accomplished and sorrow for the animal, but this is the way of life. Some must die so that others may survive. Natural selection has never seemed so real to me. 

  “Beautiful shot, you did great. I’m proud of you, son,” He said, smiling at me.

  In that moment i am happier that i have ever been, not because i had ended a life, but because I had made him proud. In his eyes I can see the absolute truth in that statement, that for once in my life someone was proud of me. 

  I looked into those eyes and saw the pride radiating from them, and I realized i had finally found what i had been hunting for all along.

 I love you, Dad.

I've been doing online collaboration with other musicians for a while now through /r/redditjams (now defunct) and /r/musicinthemaking. Essentially the process is that someone writes a piece of music and uploads it to Soundcloud for public download, and anyone can then download that track and build upon it.

There's an idea I had recently that involved the idea of ""Sound books"" but I think it is currently too difficult and costly to implement in my current state. So I turn to the wonderful internet with this idea and ask you all if you'd be interested in offering your stories to music. It could be a very terrible idea mostly due to timing problems, but I think it also could be very interesting.

So would any of you be interested in combining forces with musicians, writing stories for us to write music to? You wouldn't actually have to do anything differently on your end but the issue would be if you mind getting a piece of music that may or may not match your creative idea for your original story. I think you can just tag your post with something like [music allowed] would work.

If the idea is enticing enough I can create a subreddit for it so let me know. I have not yet asked the musicians side of this.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1jbgd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jbgd4/meta_any_interest_in_collaborating_with_musicians/,

Down towards the bottom, there laid a man. Impaled by the thought of seeing the man he has become.

Down towards the bottom, a blind man waits for a friend. His friend was killed in '83.

Down towards the bottom, a boy of 16 waits for the train. This train was not for riding. 

Down towards the bottom, a wife of a soldier waits by the phone. Her husband died in a car-bombing, yet she is to know.

Down towards the bottom, a middle-aged man scowls. The thought of being with these people disgust him; vice-versa for the others.

Down towards the bottom, a 4 y.o. girl cries. Her favorite plush animal stolen from her hands.

Down towards the bottom, I watch as these people clamber for the chance at a misshapen ray of sunlight, bending its way down from the heavens. Nothing is to stop these people from their way, whether it be something simple (A plush animal) or something harsh (A husband gone away).

Down towards the bottom, I see the mercy of the light come down, illuminating the darkness of the bottom. The people come out of their caves, reminded of their old days.

Down towards the bottom, I see the boy being pulled up by a horde of teenagers. The change in face of the boy is drastic. A face of shame goes to surprise, as strangers to himself raise him from the depths of the bottom.

Down towards the bottom, a wife is reminded of something else. A child screams for help, at the mercy of a skinned knee. She is propelled from the bottom, saving the child from infection, as her husband served her nation.

Down towards the bottom, the blind man stands up and climbs the cliffside. The sudden ping of realization giving sight to his life. His friend long passed watches him as he climbs the rocky scale.

Down towards the bottom, a girl is befriended by a man. The girl, as the fun of material possessions leaves her body, grabs the man's suit. The man, as his coattails are pulled, stands up and puts the girl on his shoulder. They hitch a ride on a stray beam of light and it carries them upwards.

Down towards the bottom, a man is uplifted. His wife shows her head from behind a rock, inviting him to dinner. Your son has missed you, she says. I know, says the man.

Down towards the bottom, light makes its way down. projecting more lost souls. These people have different problems, independent from the rest. Soon these people will find their way towards the light, but for now they rest down towards the bottom, into the deep.

Hi,

I'm MoodyAtom. This is my first time posting in this sub.

I want to tell you a little bit about this story. It is a more story-driven approach to a lecture I was given by my psychologist. I have had depression for most of my life, suicide having been a very real thing. The point of the story is to tell, though cliche, it does get better. The theme is based on the Pearl Jam song ""Deep"" from their album ""Ten"".

Also, any critique is welcome. I, according to english teachers and psychologists I've had, have always said I'm a good writer, but I would like input from actual writers. 

Thank you!

*MoodyAtom*.

1374711629.0,3,self.shortstories,1izsq5,Case Insensitive,jonrules,4,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1izsq5/case_insensitive/,"Larry and I were shelving a shipment of medieval fantasy costumes when the lemmings came. The last television season had brought with it a plague of dragons and warlocks and kings and queens and slutty princesses... a big heap of generic Halloween products spawned by the popularity of dark-age soap operas. I noticed the soldiers first: three men standing roughly 5 foot 11, though they would be closer to 6'3"" had they the intuition to stand up straight. Their gait reminded me of a newborn calf learning how to walk, calculated and awkward, but surprisingly successful. They were very much like humans in appearance. The most prominent feature was the abnormally large and freakishly pale face, which had a weird way of making their deep-set round eyes seem proportional.  Each soldier wore what appeared to be a hand-knitted holiday sweater repurposed to look like an armored breastplate. In the center of the chest was stitched a typical large black clover design that one could find in any deck of playing cards. They all had skin-tight swimmer's caps covering their heads and wrapping their faces, probably for protection against water.

""Don't move."" The soldiers had very real steel-tipped spears pointed at our throats. 

""Take whatever you want, Bro."" My jerk reaction was to make it clear that I would not stand in the way of their burgling. ""I just work here, Bro!"" I quickly realized how bizarre it would be for someone to steal merchandise from Costume Party Kingdom when there was a much more appealing jewelry store right next door. In fact, the mall contained several jewelry stores and electronics boutiques that would provide a much bigger payout than this shithole. 

""Shut up, Biatch!"" I don't know what surprised me more, the fact that the soldier used the word ""biatch"" or his lack of physical expression when he said it. The tone was right, but there was no bodily movement other than his lips: no head cocking, no finger no-no, nothing. There was something absolutely off-putting about the way this creature communicated.

Larry did not take kindly to this command: “Oh, hell no!” Larry was a pretty big guy, 6 foot 4 and bottom-heavy. He always said he didn’t have six-pack abs, but rather a whole keg. The joke was unfunny every time he said it. As far as looks go, Larry was a redneck stereotype, but he described himself as a dirty commie bastard. Larry walked up like a gangsta and slugged that mouthy son of a bitch square in the kisser. I cheered from the sidlelines: “Ohhhhh shit!” I thought that big doofus was down for sure, but the soldier did not flinch. Larry played it off with a heavy breathing sequence. He grabbed the end of the spear and jerked it around a little. “I’ll shove that stick up your ass. I bet you’d like that, wouldn’t you, Cracker Bitch?” 

The soldier replied gruffly with an angry inflection: ""You better check yourself before you wreck yourself."" He held the spear loosely while he said this, and he held a friendly disposition, like the face you would make when you're greeting a stranger.

""Step up, Bro!"" In that moment, Larry was a majestic plaid eagle, swooping in and flaring his wings for the death strike. “Make a move, Bro!” I held my breath as Larry placed his face within an inch of his prey.

""Let me apologize for the rudeness of my colleagues, gentlemen."" There were two other men, not in uniform, trailing the soldiers. This one was short, around 4 feet, yet quite proportional, not like a midget save for height. ""Skylar, Larry, I would like to introduce my associate, bzzzz bzzzz."" It sounded like he was half-assing the sound of a bumblebee. It was not even a good impression. ""You can call him Buzz, if you'd like."" Buzz was like the soldiers. He had the same look and the same mannerisms about him. The short man continued, ""My name is Jayquon Jackson."" He stared at me right in the eyes as he said this. I must point out that this man was just as pale-faced as the others. I hesitated, then moved to speak after an awkward silence, but Jayquon cut me off. ""The blacks in my world would not appreciate your joke."" For the record, I was not going to say a black joke. And I am black.

The store was empty of customers most days. I would be surprised if we were making any profit whatsoever. It was these facts that drew our supervisor, Carol, to the commotion. ""Can I help you find anything?"" She was always willing to take sales commission out of our undeserving hands. 

""Where do y'all keep the big boy costumes?"" The talky soldier now had a delightful southern twang to his accent. Carol chuckled pathetically. 

Buzz chimed in: ""What Bobby really needs is a pair of big boy undees."" 

On cue, Carol laughed loudly. She was a real whore for customer service.

""Carol!"" I did not know how to properly communicate the situation to Carol, so I froze. She gave me an evil look that meant get back to work.

Carol: ""I need these stocked before close today, guys. I'm serious.""

Another soldier cut in: My wife is named Carol. Is that short for Caroline?

Carol had a fake grin on her face: ""Yes! It's my grandmother's name.""

The soldier continued: ""A pretty name for a pretty lady."" 

Carol chuckled nervously. ""Right this way, sir.""

The moment she turned around, one of the soldiers thrust his spear into the back of Carol’s skull with a loud crack. The moron slipped and scrambled like a giant cockroach as he worked his way back on his feet. It was a serious blow, and it knocked her to the ground 10 feet ahead. As she tried to make sense of the concussion, the soldiers stabbed every inch of Carol's soft flesh like a pincushion. Larry immediately dropped his empty wallet at their feet. ""My bad, Dawg, I ain't trying to hide nothing."" I guess, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten that spears are effective killing weapons.

In the next moment, Larry and I were being herded at spear-point through the mall. There we were with these strange hunched beings, swinging their disproportionately long arms as they hobbled brainlessly down the halls with big stupid grins splashed upon their faces. Jayquon sported a particularly grotesque smile for our audience as they observed the freak show we were leading.

My mother used to tell me that the lemmings would take me away if I didn't behave. The lemmings had allowed us, or rather forced us, to choose costumes for ourselves before we left the costume store. Larry chose the Wizard King costume. He was always into magic. I chose the Dragon Princess costume, partially out of spite and partially out of curiosity.

I could hear Larry mumbling under his breath. “I’m gonna rip a hole in that nigga's sack...” The dude was steaming.

Me: “Larry, cool your jets, brah. These bastards ain’t fucking around.”

Larry: ""Shut up, Dousche. Why did you have to wear that costume?""

By our unfortunate choice of costumes, Larry and I led our parade as the royal couple. We were the ironic outcasts amongst a horde of degenerates: teenagers, thugs, fat people, all ye olde mall folk passing us by, chuckling under their hands and trying not to make eye contact. 

A security guard approached our party. ""How are y'all doing tonight?""

Jayquon: ""Just fine, sir. How about yourself?""

Security guard: ""I'm going to need you to stop here for a minute, guys."" He held his hand radio to his face. ""Yeah, there are seven of them."" 

The radio chimed and a voice responded: ""I see them.""

Security guard: ""You can't be out here on mall property without a permit, guys.""

Buzz replied: ""Yes, Sir, we were just heading out. We're gonna have to brave that heat wave. In the middle of October, can you believe that?""

Security guard: ""Yeah, there's a cool front coming in Thursday.""

Buzz: ""My son lives in Wisconsin. They're getting 3 feet of snow today.""

Security guard: ”Boy, I tell ya what. Well, you know, if you don't like the weather today, wait until tomorrow!"" Both Buzz and the security guard had a hearty laugh at that comment.

Buzz: ""It's not so much the heat, it's the humidity that gets ya.""

Security guard: ""Yessir. Maybe we'll get some relief from this energy shortage.""

Buzz: ”In this economy?”

Security guard: ”Your tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen.”

""I hear that, Officer.” Buzz made his leave: ”We better be on our way if we're gonna beat this rush hour.""

Security guard: ""Alright, you take care, now."" We watched our only hope for salvation stroll back to his post.

We walked for what seemed like days. I had never noticed how ginormous the mall was before. Contemplating your imminent demise really puts these moments in perspective. “You all go on without out me. I’ll stay here.” Jayquon signaled to Buzz and entered a small book store. The soldiers followed Jayquon. I think back to all the opportunities we had to escape. We weren’t bound with ropes, the soldiers were clumsy, and there were plenty of people to help us. Now, the soldiers had left us and only Buzz remained. We shut up and followed orders, instead.

We approached the exit near closing time, my favorite hour. The mall had cleared out nearly all of its patrons. “Ahhhhh!” Buzz let out a series of yelps, ruining the cool silence. A diseased lemming had latched on to Buzz and was gnawing at his leg. She was a disgusting witch, dragging herself across the floor and leaving a trail like a slug. This was an animal that smelled like shit and looked the part. Her big eyes were bloodshot and black bile oozed through her teeth. Buzz produced a club and proceeded to beat the shit out of her until she let go. The thuds were so powerful I thought Buzz would break that bitch in half. She screamed like she would explode from the pain, that sort of high-pitched sound that rattles you on the inside and shoots your adrenaline beyond 100%. I flinched every time the club smashed into her body. “WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHY?!” She yelled at Buzz like he had betrayed her.

""Let go, Hoe!"" The witch did not heed Larry's advice quickly. She took a heroic pounding to the face and torso and eventually curled up with her hands over her head, still howling like a banshee. My heart was in my ears at this point beating on my temples. There was lemming goop all over the floor.

Did Buzz always have that club? I don’t remember. He stood in front of us, club in hand, to protect Larry and I from the witch. He teased her by slamming that motherfucker against the floor when she tried to slither closer. “We need to go!” That is all he had to say. We followed without question. 

We must have ran 300 miles per hour, because the next thing I knew we were approaching a cliff somewhere in the wilderness. “Jump if you want to live.” High on adrenaline and fear, Larry and I jumped and cleared a 40 foot gap, soaring through the air like god damn antelopes. We stopped on the other side. Buzz carefully examined the horizon, reached down, then pulled up the curtain of the world in front of us. It all made sense. This transdimensional barrier was here all along, we just had to lift it up! The world on the other side had a vivid hue of orange dusk unlike any color I had ever seen. There were prairie plants and small grasses over the hills, and there were no insects to be seen. 

Larry hesitated. Something was wrong. “Shh, I hear crying.” In the tall grass, 15 feet away, another witch was gnawing on a lemming. The girl’s legs and arms were torn to shreds and the witch was licking sap from the remaining stubs. Buzz held up the curtain, “Let’s go!” I stared at him as the girl cried softly while being eaten alive. “You take care of it.” Buzz handed me the club and I stood over the witch. I cocked it back and dropped the club on the back of her head as hard as I could. Before I knew it, I lost my footing and the witch was standing tall over me as I cowered on my back. Buzz had made it look so easy. The club bounced off her head, causing no damage, as if her skin was made of thick rubber. 

The witch stared at me with a look of disgust. “Would it be alright with you if I perform my rightful duty in peace?” I thought about the question in silence, not knowing exactly how to answer. The half-eaten girl rolled over to have a look at me. “Mind your own business, faggot.” Her words riled me up and I  tried to respond, “I was trying to help you, you honky bitch.” I never did finish the “honky bitch” part of my sentence, because the girl talked over me. “Did I ask for your help?” The witch picked up what remained of a leg. “May I continue?” I did not care for the obvious sarcasm nor the tone of her voice. I returned the club to Buzz, feeling humiliated. The crying continued much louder than before, “Oh the pain!” The witch and the girl giggled as I turned my back on them.

“Wait! Don’t go! For the love of pete do not go in there!” Jayquon was running like a hellion towards the cliff. 

I called to Buzz: “Wait, Buzz, I don’t understand!”

Buzz seemed oblivious to Jayquon’s warning. “They’re lesbians.” 

Me: “Jayquon says don’t go in there!”

Buzz: “I think he means don’t go in there, as in don’t fall into the pit across the cliff.” He pointed to the valley.

I tried to plead with Buzz: “No, dude, I think he means don’t go through the... the..."" What do you call this thing? ""Don't go through the portal!”

Larry approached the cliff to confirm the instructions: “Jayquon! Do you mean don’t go through the portal or don’t go into the pit?” 

“The portal! THE PORTAL!” Jayquon yelled out in desperation as he hopped up and down.

Larry relayed the message: “He said the portal, Bro. I’m sure he said the portal.”

“Alright, let’s go through the portal.” Buzz had made up his mind. 

“NO!” Jayquon leapt from the cliff and fell short. His body splashed upon the earth below. 

Buzz grabbed Larry and I by the neck and shoved us into the new world. The view was stunning. “Holy shit.” That was what Larry kept repeating. We stood there for hours admiring the spectacle.

“Are you two fags done jerking each other off?” Buzz was standing behind us. 

Jayquon spoke as he flipped through a periodical: “Nice to see you, gentlemen.” He awkwardly held the cover of the magazine in our line of sight to make sure we noticed it.

I responded reflexively: “Nice to see you, too.”

Jayquon: “Why would it be nice to see me? I kidnapped you and forced you to come here.”

Larry whispered to me: “This is creepy, man. I saw that guy go splat.”

Larry: “How do we get out of here?” There was no response to Larry’s question.

Me: “Why did you tell us not to come in here?”

Jayquon: “Obviously, I made a mistake.”

Buzz scoffed: “I tried to tell those idiots.”

Jayquon: “I meant to say don’t fall into the pit.”

I tried to still have the dark effect without being overly vulgar. Well enough stalling, here it is and be brutally honest:

When it comes down to it, there isn't much to me. I go to school. I'm not part of any clubs and I don't have any friends. I make decent grades and try my best to be avoided. If I had to describe myself, I'd say I was a cage. I'm a cage for the monster that lives inside my head and in order to keep it locked up tight, it's best to stay away. 
	I only speak when spoken to and I stay out of the way in all situations. If someone tries to make a habit of talking to me, they only anger the monster so I let them know what it thinks and they leave me alone.
	I go home and my mother calls me names that no longer affect me. So she leaves physical bruises that no longer make me cry. When my father makes it home he adds to the bruises and the cuts. Then he takes it a step further. This is the only time I cry. This is the only time I allow the monster to rattle the bars of it's cage and make me struggle to keep it inside.
	One day he pushes too far. He holds me down and hurts me in the worst possible way and like a key in a lock, the monster's cage is unlatched. For just a moment, my father gets to lavish in the pain he's causing. And the monster simply smiles. In a flash The Monster bursts out and pushes me to the dark recesses of my mind.
	After a time that feels like forever and yet nothing at all, I fell The Monster sink Its claws into me and pull me onto its back so that though I have no control over what it does, I can see. The first thing that grabs my attention is my father's lifeless naked body as The Monster passes him on its way out into the living room. I watch as The Monster kills my mother, calling her all the names she had thrown at me throughout the years.
	I cling to this semi-consciousness as The Monster runs out the door of our small house, naked, and down the dirt road. I see that our body is covered in blood and I feel the smile stretched across our face. Then there are voices in the distance. I have a quick moment of panic when I realize people are coming and I'm scared what The Monster will do to them.
	Then it let's go. I'm thrown back into full consciousness so fast that I don't have time to make my body work and stay standing. I crumple to the ground as a man's footsteps carefully approach. He lifts me up and I scramble to find footing and look into the man's eyes, scared of what I'll find. As if reading my mind, his face is doused in horror as he takes in my blood covered nakedness.
	“What happened?” he yells in my face as if I might be deaf or asleep.
	I pull myself straight at that moment and a seemingly sane thought floats across my mind as the only possible response as I realize what The Monster has done.
	I laugh softly at the thought. “The bitch footed me with the bill.”",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1itnlh,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1itnlh/first_post_a_little_thing_i_wrote_about_a_year/,

A small but courageous child enters a restroom and hears the distinct sound of expletives and running water.  Two men are standing there.  One, older at age twenty-six, washes his hands, and mutters constantly about the ""fucking fucks out to kill him.""  The other, physically aged around 50, uses the urinal placed conveniently in front of him to block out all knowledge that there is a man beside him washing away either his sins or his sanity.  Given the entrance of the child, one would hope that the muttering man might halt his fearful utterances to protect the ears of the unworthy and unprepared, but he continues his rant.  One might also pray that the suddenly cautious and unsocial child might back away from this conversation of insanity.  He does not, and moves quickly past them into the bathroom stall.  This is much to the dismay of both the fifty year old man and the urinal.  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The boy hums the tune to his favorite television series as he allows the urine to escape the dark depths of his body and bathe within the thin fluorescent lighting of the bathroom.  Barely realizing that it is free at last, the urine ends its journey in the rusted and moist pipes of the plumbing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The fifty year old man, no longer able to feign his usage of the urinal without looking like a coward in the presence of a child, takes a deep breath and asks why the crazed man is washing his hands so much.  Silence.  The sudden quiet brings fear into the fifty year old man, and he almost forgets to fear for the child situated nearby.  The urinal begins to beckon to the physically aged gentleman again, but he resists the comfort its gleaming, porcelain surface offers.  He begins to ask again, but only a breath of air escapes as the cleanly shaven head of the twenty-six year old man turns toward him and becomes furrowed.  His dark blue eyes pierce into the fifty year old man’s mind.  The silence deafens the occupants of the restroom.  The tune of the child has stopped.  The only remaining sound is that of the delusional man's sink.  A family of cockroaches recently made their home in the drainpipes of that sink.  Supposedly able to withstand the power of a nuclear bomb, they now silently drown in the liquid that gave them life.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A toilet flushes in the child's stall, ending what could have been an eternity of silence.  The child exits his realm of safety, washes his hands in the twenty-six year old man's sink, and says goodbye to the two men of the bathroom.  He concludes his restroom adventure by leaving through the same cruel door that allowed the three bathroom occupants entrance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The two men glance at each other.  The mentally mature man had considered pulling out a small pocket knife and unjustifiably killing the fifty-year old man, but the sight of the child disrupted these thoughts.  Reminded of his childhood, the mature man weeps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, the child arrives safely back into the hands of his parents within the Applebee's.  A sweet and smiling waiter asks him what he would like to order.  The child shyly refuses to answer, but after some encouragement from his parents, one word escapes his lips: fuck.

With a swift motion the barrier was broken and the clear liquid flowed freely, stretching out along the cold porcelain curvature of the bathtub. The water ran, pooling at the end, before rising, rippling under the pressure of its peers, each drop fighting for its own space in the tub. As her own miniature ocean began to lap at the shore of the bath she returned the faucet to its original position, stemming the chaos, only a last few drops escaping. The thoughts in her mind still rippled like the water once had, she only wished for the storm to calm so she could relax. Unscrewing the bottle she poured the pills into her hand, several spilling to the floor, her gaze did not shift her only focus was finding shelter from the hurricane that was raging inside her skull.  



Taking a deep breath in the tension eased. Tentatively she stepped into the bath, disturbing the peace that the water had found. For just a moment, her breath caught. Inside her chest her heart was pounding with an ache she had never known. She hesitated, and then calmness washed over her, as the warmth of the water flowed through her. She knew this was what she needed. Her sharp expression smoothed as the water began to calm her, cleansing every part of her being. Giving into the soothing touch of the water she exhaled deeply, breathing out her troubles. Tentatively her mind began to wander, reaching out for a long forgotten moment of bliss to recite endlessly in her thoughts. She painted the scene in her mind, a time without worry or regret, without commitments or disappointment.



Crystal clear dew drops raced down leaf slops, carelessly leaping off the edge, blissful and clear minded, craving adventure, for the excitement and unknown that waited. The wind rang its fingers through her flowing hair, the flowers outstretched, reaching towards her to be picked up like a small child yearning for their mother. The warm touch of the sun cascaded across the meadow, illuminating every minor element, a moment frozen in time; a moment where nothing at all mattered. It was paradise. However the longer she allowed herself to indulge in the memory the more it distorted, twisting against her. The flowers recoiled from her touch, the sky darkened, angered from her presence. The air was cold. The storm had found her, she began to run, and she knew she could not hide for long her but that short moment had been enough, she was confident in her decision.



She let go. The fight inside her was gone, the war was done. No longer was there any pain, or struggle. Calm; at last everything was calm, the storm clouds parting forever. A clang echoed though the bathroom as the cool metal object slipped from her fingertips. The warmth flowed from her, the water around her now tepid and tinged scarlet. Her body was distressed and drained from the battle she had fought. Fought within her, a war which could not be won or lost, for the fight was with her. Water began to fill her lungs, but do not be fooled she was not drowning, for at last, she could finally breathe. At last she could rest.



Upon the floor was a lined, crumbled notebook page, ripped out, its edges carelessly torn. Heavy crease lines covered it, each fold line in the page, telling the story of how many times this ended had approached, only for something to change its course. Scrawled across the page in smudged black ink were only two words. The long battle for her life, and this was the result. Just two little words, to express her struggle, express her final wish. Forget me.

I haven't pooped since day 1. I had hoped to hold it until we returned to the hotel the following night.  But I knew when I crawled into my bag that this night might have other plans.  It was such a strange mixture of feelings.  On the one hand, there was almost an inevitability that pooping would happen this night.  I was afraid if I stayed in the tent there might be an extremely embarrassing situation. On the other hand, I was freezing and I didn't want to leave the tent.  I didn't want to wake up my travel companion.  I was afraid that the poop might be a messy affair, and just maybe I could hold it for another day.

After hours of tossing and turning, I decided I must get up.  I put my freezing FiveFingers on my already freezing feet.  Upon exiting the tent, I'm greeted by the most haunting, beautiful gift of a vista.  It was a clear night, the first since we had started hiking.  Machu Picchu Mountain was visible bathed in silvery moonlight.  In the distance were the snow capped peaks of the Andes, also reflecting the brilliance of June's supermoon.   I saw constellations I've always read about but never seen: the Crab, Pegasus and his Great Square--even Orion was here!  I didn't expect to see him in the Southern Hemisphere!  The Big Dipper, low on the horizon and upside down, pointing towards home.  And Cruz, the beautiful Southern Cross.  CSN kept repeating in my head--""When you see the Southern Cross for the first time.  You understand now why you came this way.  The truth that you've been running from is so small, but it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day!""  The truth is that I'm a worthwhile person. 

I could've stood mesmerized there for hours, except that I had a job to do, a biological imperative.

I walked up a lonely trail to the restroom.  My experience with the free restrooms on the trail was that they were nasty.  This one proved to be no exception.  I open the door and look in.  There's shit all over the floor, but it doesn't matter.  This is my destiny.  There's no toilet, just a porcelain hole in the ground.  I drop trou, being as careful as I can not to let my hiking pants touch the turdy tile floor.  I squat slightly, with no idea what's going to happen.  I'm afraid it's going to be a drawn out watery affair, and I will have to stay in this tiring squatting position a long time while my insides flush out.   I'm afraid I might slip on the floor, damp with piss and excrement.  I'm afraid I might miss the hole and make the room even more unsanitary.  Was I standing in exactly the right position?

It was the moment of truth.  In less than a minute, there was a solid compact mass of well-formed shit.  It felt like a beautiful black birth.  I knew in an instant that that was going to be all, and it was enough.  It seemed to fall towards the porcelain hole for an eternity.  And…

Bullseye.

I shivered, and, trying to ignore these sounds, drew my heavy  lidded mind back to my studies. The house stilled, but remained awake. Outside, the sun gave one final, presumptuous glow and disappeared. The greenery  faded to shadows, the winds stopped, but the house remained, and, having observed all of this, I remembered when I first saw this place.

This seed had been handed down from generation to generation. Only the worthiest descendant would be able to successfully plant this seed and live. It seemed the deeper he spiraled into a great depression, the greater the intensity of his solitude, the quicker his plum seed burgeoned. Soon enough, his life was facilitated by this mere speck of ovule. He was able to buy a toupee, he had a young, blonde damsel by his side, money to fill wagons, and even a pet zebra. With his increasing opulence came the trust issues he would have when he was still a married man. Soon enough, driven mad by wealth and success, he began to trust no one. One dreary evening, a young charlatan, quite the looker—the classic tall, dark, and handsome, smooth talking stereotypical male—offered to take some of his plums off his hands. Well, what was he going to do with these? Was he going to attempt to compete with his prosperousness? Would it be for the well-being of the village? Surely, no idiot would waste all of those plums on others. The value and tenderness they were grown with, impossible to merely give away. The old man’s greed and disbelief were overcome when, in his sleep, he heard the murmur of what sounded like his wife. “Give him the plums,” she said, “he’s a nice young man.” The next morning, he left a woven basket full of plums on the charlatan’s doorstep. Curiously peering through the diminutive window of the bungalow, he noticed a faint silhouette of what appeared to be a child. Cute and innocent, right? He could do no harm…unless, the quack foresaw his visit. The child was but an informant.

As she made her way down the road, she spotted a most beautiful cupcake, but it was not like any cupcake she had seen before, for it was blue and glittery, an edible type of glittery, not the crafting kind. Becky slowly walked up to the cupcake, not too slow and not too fast so as not to alert her neighbors, whose names were George and Harriet Franklin. They were very strange people, avoiding regular humans at all cost. Becky got quite close to the cupcake, marveling at how wondrous a cupcake it was. Most cupcakes are wondrous things, but this one was exceptionally so. Since she was quite close to the windowsill, she could hear inside the house. 

""Oh George, I am most glad we traded our children for that wondrous magic blue cupcake that is unguarded and sitting on our windowsill."" 

""I am most glad as well, for with that cupcake we can take over the entire world.""

Once she had heard these things, Becky was most quick to snatch the cupcake from the windowsill. She planned not to take over the world, but more simply just take over her town, for it was a mighty big town full of very kind people, and she wished to be in charge of them all. 

Becky ran home, and got very sweaty, and once she got home, she ran into her rather small room, it was not an actual room, you see, it was a closet, for Becky's parents had died when she was young and she was made to live with her Aunt Peggy and Uncle Vernon, both of whom did not like Becky, for they were very strange people, you see, very strange indeed, for they did not like Becky for she was not their actual child, their actual child being named Aaron. Anyways, once she got in her room/closet, she sat down on her bed, which wasn't much of a bed, more like two pillows stacked atop each other, and she closely observed the cupcake. She cautiously put her tongue on the cupcake and tasted it. It was absolutely delicious, the best cupcake she had ever tasted! And she had tasted some very good cupcakes in her lifetime. The cupcake was so good, in fact, that she stuffed the entire thing in her mouth, scarfing it down quickly, for she was a starving child and was always hungry. 

The cupcake, having been stolen, was not to cause good effects for Becky, for the wizard that had enchanted the cupcake had put a curse on it for anyone who ate it that was not George or Harriet Franklin. Poor Becky had no idea until she suddenly started to feel dizzy and confused, and so she tried very hard to open her door, but she could not get the door opened for she had locked it. Her airway started to close up and she saw a bright light....

Treacherous stretches of undulating bog are said to constitute the entirety of the outlands, as far as the great clay wall. However, no inquisitive fellow has yet been bold to the task of confirming this. Tales of folk law speak of monstrous creatures beneath the surface of the outlands, from the massive Lalistrus that tunnels through the ground, propelling it’s self by waves of muscular contraction along its extensive body; to the wandering Tumptundron, that edges its way through deep ridges in the ground, avoiding the light, as if it would burn through the segments of heavy armour that shell its many legs. Nothing but folk law, of course. However, the careful musings of the old and wise assure the people of Eudora that none should risk venturing far, due to the monsoons that perverse the outlands, as and when they please.

The people of Eudora, as they are known only to themselves, have made their homes and lived their lives within the great tree Eudora, for as long as their people have existed. During the long warm days, the people of Eudora gather in the shade of the great tree and tell tales, passed down through generations, of how their lives came to be. Gazing up, they speak of how, in its youth, Eudora was but a single stem, bitter at the world for making it alone, with no other of its kind. When the people of Eudora arrived, they soothed the tree with their gentle ways and carefree merriment. The tree did so love the people of Eudora that it grew branches for them to make their homes on and leaves to give them shade.

Similar wonderfully whimsical stories were eagerly shared that very day, zealously conducted by eccentric gesticulations. The sun glistened through the leaves, flickering through faces of mirth and wonder that were scattered among the mossy roots of Eudora. Their minds seemed to willingly drift between thoughts abstracted from their surroundings and thoughts of the fantastic mythologies of their people; sometimes marrying the two in a fantasy of pride.

“Well don’t just fucking stand there, get on with it.”

This is for myself.

My psychiatrist told me it would be good for me to put my thoughts down on paper.  Well, I don't have any paper. I guess this will have to do.

It's hard to imagine the feeling of coming home from a long day of work, opening the front door and finding your only son hanging from the upstairs banister. Blue in the face and cold to the touch. A chair knocked on its side under his dangling feet. He had worn the suit his father had given him before he passed away.

Cancer. 

He was never the same after that. I suppose he wanted to make a good impression, wherever he may end up. The EMTs would later find the letter he had written stashed away in his breast pocket. Coincidentally, the suit he was wearing at his death would be the same suit he would be buried in. 

He wanted an end to his suffering, and he found his cure. His suffering had ended, but in doing so he piled more onto his mother.

I hadn't talked to Robert in some time before his passing, and for that I blame myself. Things had changed between him and I, but I couldn't point my finger on exactly *what.* His father had passed away 4 months prior, and at the time he seemed more into isolation than anything else. In hindsight I should have known exactly what was going on in his head. How obvious it is now - years later - having thought about it day after day. What I should have done differently...

Blame.

Guilt.

Robert and I used to be inseparable, and his mother revered me as her other son. It was nice having a motherly figure in my life. My family life hadn't been stable for as long as I could remember, and often times we were left to fend for ourselves. I would come over and eat dinner with Robert and his Mother and Father nearly everyday, and for that hour or so at a time I felt like I actually had a family that loved me. 

There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about Robert's funeral. He was a fairly popular kid, and nearly our entire 8th grade class was there. Friends would take turns sharing anecdotes from times spent with Robert, laughing and crying all the while. Robert's mother had sat in the front row of the church, and there wasn't a single break in her sobs. I had tried to console her at one point, but she brushed me off. I was taken aback, but I figured she just needed her space. 

She composed herself momentarily and addressed the audience, thanking us for attending. She told us it meant a lot to her and that she had something to share with us. It was the note Robert had left. Through broken tears, this is what she read:

*Lately life hasn't been what it used to be. I don't find joy in anything I once did and everyday is a constant struggle. If you're reading this right now, I've lost that struggle. I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused you, and I hope that you can be strong without me. I've gone to be with Dad, and I hope to see you all when you get here. Love, Robert.*

She put the note down on the podium and reached for her purse. Pulling the metallic object and placing it to her head.

*Click*

*Boom*

Her last words, ""I'm coming home.""

I mutter as I groggily stumble around trying to get dressed. I'm so tired I can't see straight or think.  I rub my eyes hard but still have blurred vision. 
Climbing into the ambulance a small amount of adrenalin puts me in game mode. 
I know what I have to do. 
What I've been trained to do. 
What I'm good at.  
I run through some acls protocols in my head on the hectic early morning code 3 commute to our destination. My green EMT partner is driving like a mad woman. Prolly all hopped up on the idea of saving someone's life. 
Heh' Rookie. 

Had worked guy for about 30 min put large bore iv into his neck ( external jugular, very few people can do these as good as me and it makes a few green medics here think im some kinda badass) and start pushing the EPI. 
3 unsuccessful intubation attempts and i still have no airway. (Dude has huge fat tongue/face and no neck = a nightmare intubation. ) 
Worked him hard for 20 min/ four rounds of epi. Im like the conductor of an orchestra. I direct resuscitation in a flat monotone voice  and  have to fight back a yawn at one point. Other than his extremely difficult airway management things go as smooth as something as chaotic as working a code can go. ( if you've ever seen one you'd know what I mean by ""chaotic"")  
I have had no response.  Patient remains in asystole confirmed in 3 leads. (This guys toast) 
Then decided to call time of death on scene. And you should have seen the nasty looks those cna's (certified nursing assistant=medical peon)
We're giving me. Like I was worse than hitler.  No one said anything to me. As i thanked them for their help and told them they did excellent CPR. They get attached to them old coots in those nursing home working with them day after day. They all leave the room and I call for coroner on the radio. My partner and I collect our gear and cover dude in a sheet. I close his eyes with my fingers. "" see you on the other side buddy, ...or not."" I murmur. About to walk out of the room when I spontaneously make the catholic cross thingy over dude in sheet. My partner sees this and is looking at me with a strange half smirk/ amused look. 
""I dunno why I did that. I'm an Atheist"" I say and chuckle feeling silly. Waiting for coroner. 
""I guess we don't need to baby sit him let's get some  fresh air. I need food and coffee. "" I say as we exit to await the coroner in the parking lot. still have blurred vision.

 When you are at your happiest moment, everything in life is where it should be. After years of work and struggle, your ducks are finally in a row. You've been preparing a meal the entire day. It actually started the day before with a trip to the butcher to get the perfect cut of meat. Next, you let it marinate over night to make sure it is just right. Today was spent cleaning and tidying making sure the house was in order, creating an atmosphere to allow you to truly enjoy your meal. It is essential that nothing is out of place just to ensure that there are no distractions. When things feel right, the perfect playlist fills the airwaves as you begin to prep the rest of the meal, everything needs to be done ahead of time to make sure all cooking times are precise and all components of the meal are ready to plate at the same time. 

The vegetables are cut and ready to be put on the barbecue, the salad awaits its dressing, and the barbecue is warming. This is when things start to change for the worse, the doorbell rings. You don't have time to visit with guests, nor do you have enough food to invite them to stay, the only option is forcing them to go. The mistake has already been made though, the moment you put down the tongs and move toward the door, you have gone too far, past the point of no return so to speak. The door opens and before waiting to hear if they are welcome, your new guest steps into the house. They don't bother with formal greetings, they simply sit down and start introducing themselves. No concern for what you were previously doing, or what plans you may have for the balance of the evening. They make themselves at home and spread out, not realizing that their comfort directly diminishes your own. 
You entertain your guest, let them feel welcome for a moment but knowing they can't stay. You decide the best option is to start serving cocktails, hoping maybe their stomach will become upset and they will leave on their own. When this doesn't work, the radio gets turned up a little louder in an effort to to make their stay less enjoyable, you want to disrupt their stay. In order to be effective. You must turn up the radio so that it becomes uncomfortable, even for yourself. Your entire body aches, nothing seems better than your bed. But, your memory and thoughts of the food you have waiting keep you on track, keep you fighting and pushing, pushing your guest out the door. Then, just when you think you could not possibly survive another minute of the throbbing, your guest realizes you're a hard sell. They pack up their belongings, gather their coat and their shoes and they are off, they're gone. 
As quickly as the guest arrived, they have departed. Leaving nothing but a sour taste from the cocktails and a throbbing headache from the radio. You're ready though, the food has been waiting, it hasn't spoiled the wait has made the flavours stronger.
The food goes onto the barbecue and it cooks. While it does, you laugh and share stories of your odd guest with your loved ones. Your resilience has made you stronger, the experience has brought you closer, you are ready for an even more intimate evening  with your family after the intrusion of the unwanted guest.
The timer goes off, the propane is shut down. The meat is cut, the veggies are spread, and the food is ready to be plated. The family has sat down and they are ready for the meal and what lies ahead. 
The first bite is glorious, everything you expected it to be and more. The long wait makes you appreciate everything more. You learn to savour every bite. 
It's time for dessert, as you get up to retrieve it, the doorbell rings, you walk to the door, open it with a smile, basking in the light of the time you have spent with your loved ones. As the door opens, you see the familiar shadow. The guest has returned, they forgot something. It doesn't matter what, they are already in your home. The smells that fill the house have intrigued them, they want a taste of what you have. Demand that you share your spoils with them. You give, and you give, and you give, but nothing seems to appease your guest's appetite. They will take everything you have. Exhausted, you take a nap, you promise yourself it won't be long but you know when you wake the guest will be gone and all will be right. As you sleep, your loved ones thank you for trying your best to oust that unwelcome guest. They tuck you in, tell you they love you. Promise they will see you in the morning. 
Your morning doesn't come though. But their's does, the morning comes, it is darker than usual, there is a mess to clean up. But it's ok, the meal was worth it, they are happy to wash every dish, clean up every crumb. They will spend the following days talking about that ungrateful guest, talk about the struggle of getting the guest to leave. But, those conversations will end. As the days fade into weeks, and weeks into months, then into years, the conversation will change. It will no longer be about the guest, but rather the meal, the meal they were so happy to eat, they will talk about its preparation and what it meant. They will remember the chef, the time, the care, and the patience that went into that evening and many more before it. They will be thankful for that night, they know they were part of something special and lucky to know such a chef, who even at their worst, was a gracious host.

This was the result.,KarmelCHAOS,4,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fgd0m/going_through_a_tough_time_my_ex_told_me_to_write/,"As I walked along the beach, the sand caressing my feet, I stared out at the ocean in it’s vast emptiness. The waves crashed against the shore with a rhythmic pounding that soothed the echoes of voices in my head. The moon was out, bright and inviting, lighting the empty beach around me. I sat down at the base of the water, letting the tide embrace me. I didn’t know why I was here, but I knew it was where I wanted to be.

My life had become a mess, something I couldn’t figure out no matter how hard I tried. Event after event passed around me, until I felt that I was nothing more than a spectator in a horribly acted play based upon me. The actors coming and going, never quite right to the plot, but always there and always acting. The stage began to get cluttered and I found myself pushed aside, as if the story was no longer about me, but those around me.

I watched them wander because that’s all they ever did, wander. They’d reach the stage, act out their lines and exit stage left, their presence still felt despite the emptiness of their bodies and mind upon the backdrop of my life.

I stood back and watched as the actors filled up the stage, their costumes accentuating their different traits. A clown on one corner, trying to make me laugh to forget the screaming in my mind, giggling and playful, but nary cracking a smile upon my wretched lips. A woman, her features mundane, though filled with beauty. She danced her way to me, her face close to mine, before gently placing her lips on mine. She kissed me then, though my lips would not part. She looked disappointed before dancing her way back off stage.

The actors and actresses began to thin, as they played their part in my life and found their exit. That was how it went, in my life. Permanence was not a word that would ever pass my lips. Nothing but the loneliness I felt once they found their way to the end of their plot arcs stayed with me. That’s what my life had become, a series of feeling nothing; loneliness. I inched back more and more, until my back leaned against the set. I watched them go, until it was but me on the stage. The audience left their seats and walked away, the actors had gone on to focus on their lives, no longer a part of mine. The spotlight shone on only me as I walked to the edge of the stage, I whispered my final lines and leapt from the stage, praying someone in the audience would be left to catch me. As I fell, all I could think was that I was a fool for praying.

Snapped back to the reality of my situation, I stared back out at the empty crashing ocean. It’s vast emptiness began to call to me, beckoning. I tried, I swear I did, to ignore it’s calls. Suddenly the realization that vast emptiness was better than the sickening loneliness I felt began to tear me apart. I stood up, not bothering to wipe the sand from all around me. I breathed in deep, scared but knowing it’d all be over soon. Strangely, as I began to walk into the water, a smile broke the static in my face for the first time in weeks. I smiled as the water reached my neck, until finally I was overcome by the waves. The all encompassing emptiness of the ocean swallowed me and I took my final breath, the smile stayed upon my face, until suddenly I was one with it.

It had been nine years since he had last seen Rachel, and he didn’t know what he was supposed to be thinking.  This was a girl whom he had engaged to, a girl whom he had lived with, and the first real love of his life.  Nine years ago, he would’ve traded anything in the world to have a better life with her, but now, she was just a distant memory.  

Jack waited in the rainy weather for 15 minutes before his bus finally arrived.  To him, those 15 minutes felt like 3 hours.  He had been thinking about her for a few days now, and now he was fighting that one tiny part of him that still had feelings to her.  It took him nearly a year to move on with his life when she had left him, and the last eight years had filled with very little thought of her.  He had moved on, he was certain of that, but now that she was brought back into his mind, he began to reminisce on the six great years that he had spent with her.  It didn’t end like he had hoped, and things were never fixed between the two of them, but that was okay.  He accepted the fact that she wasn’t the one, and he had moved on years ago, but it all came flooding back now. 

At the bus stop, Jack had been thinking about the fabulous college years that he and Rachel had spent together.  There trip to France after junior year, the promise they made to each other to spend eternity together one night when they were studying of their Biology midterm, even the times they would sneak away behind Rachel’s dorm to umm, “talk”.  But the arrival of the bus broke his daze, and when he sat down and the bus began moving again, he remembered why he and Rachel ended the way they did.  They fought, they yelled, they disagreed, they lied, they snuck around behind each other’s backs, they cheated.  The cheating wasn’t very prominent though, Jack once met a beautiful girl at a party during his first year in college, and Rachel decided to let loose the summer after her senior year in high school.  The same high school the two had met at, and had begun dating in right before graduation.  Jack had always thought that the happiness that they felt when they were alone, the constant want to be with each other, and the seemingly quick makeups and the similar life goals would be enough to keep them together forever, but it wasn’t.  Rachel got so mad once, that she decided to skip out on the trip to Jack’s home for Thanksgiving, and she flew across the country to her other friends instead.  

The final breaking point came a little more than a year after the two had graduated from college.  Jack went on a trip to Prague with some of his pals from Law School, and Rachel wanted to forget about him for the week.  Rachel went to some clubs with some of her friends, the same friends that Jack never liked, and Jack found out.  Jack didn’t mention it for quite some time, but when Rachel yelled at Jack for not letting her go out on a Friday night, Jack brought up the clubbing.  Rachel, frustrated, stormed out of their apartment, and never moved back.  A week later, Rachel called up Jack, and asked him to bring her her clothes.  A week after that, the two sat down for a real talk.  Jack tries to blur the talk out of his mind, because everything seemed so simple and happy then, and when he looks back on it, it makes him miserable.  Jack only remembers the end, in which Rachel claimed that she in no way wanted to end their relationship, and that Jack meant the world to her.  Rachel just needed some time alone, and Jack knew that he had to give her that much.  

As time passed, Jack slowly started to realize that Rachel wasn’t coming back to him.  All the little inconsistencies in their relationship added up, and it just wasn’t fun for her anymore.  Jack was miserable for these couple of months.  About three months after their “break” had commenced, Rachel called Jack.  She was two months pregnant, and she was keeping the baby.  Rachel told him that she was sorry, but it was something she had to do at the time.  The father was just some random guy Rachel met at a party, and the fact that Rachel, the girl who Jack stole the virginity of, and whom did the same to him, would just go out and sleep with another guy almost right away.  Jack had an anger inside of him that was raging so badly that he told Rachel to never talk to him again.  Rachel didn’t beg for forgiveness, but she asked for it.  She told him she knew she was wrong, but she knew that everything was over.  That was the last time Jack talked to Rachel, and the words that he last said still haunted his mind “I gave you everything, but all you wanted was a bottle of vodka and some unprotected sex.  Goodbye Rachel.”

This was nine years ago, almost to the day, and the intense memory of Jack’s life as he had known for six years ending so quickly and heartbreakingly ate at him do this day; that’s why Jack didn’t like to think about her, or how it ended. But he couldn’t avoid it anymore, and he had to face the things that had scared him.  Jack never met the baby, but he had learned his name.  Jonathan.  He always found it funny that she named it something similar to his name, but his name was Jack, so he never felt like it was really named after him.  Jack ran into one of Rachel’s friends a few years back and learned that she never married, she never even told anyone, except her parents, who the father was.  Jack felt urged to ask about the alleged party that Rachel had met this guy at, but decided against it.  Rachel’s friend mentioned how Rachel only went out with them twice after their breakup, she was either crying, or pregnant the rest of the time, and refused to go out.  Oddly enough, Jack was disappointed that the things Rachel left him for she was never able to have.  It made it all seem pointless to him. 

Jack never contacted Rachel after that night where she told him he was pregnant.  He once received a Christmas card from Rachel and Jonathan, but that was only once, and he never sent one to them.  Jack was honestly quite nervous knowing that in a less than an hour, he would be meeting the kid.  For some reason, he wanted Jonathan to like him, he didn’t know why, but he did. 

Before Jack knew it, his twenty minutes bus ride was over, and he needed to get off the bus.  Jack walked a few blocks, and then reached the building that he was supposed to enter.  He double checked the address one more time, he had it right.  Jack tightened his silk, black tie, put his phone in his jacket pocket, and entered.  The minute he entered, his heart sank.  Jack began to cry, and he began to cry harder than he had ever cried in his life.  The breakup, the pregnancy, not even the call he had gotten the previous week to come had made him as emotional as he was right then and there.  Jack gathered up all the strength in him, and walked forwards.  He saw the sweet, innocent face of the first girl he had ever loved from across the room.  Those soft, tender, rose like lips that had gently pressed upon his more times than he could ever imagine now sat still, perfectly dressed with a light layer of pink lipstick.  Jack bit his lip, clenched his fist, and did everything he could to keep himself composed.  

Jack walked with a slow pace, and went over to where Rachel was.  He took the single red rose out of his jacket, and prepared to give it to her.  When he was finally within a foot of her, he stopped walking.  He didn’t say a word.  Jack stared at Rachel for a few seconds, and then gently kissed her on the forehead.  Immediately afterwards, while still feeling the tickle in his throat that made him want to cry, he placed the rose down softly inside the casket.  “Goodbye Rachel, I will always remember you” were the only words he muttered before walking away.  

Jack couldn’t bear to stay longer to talk to Rachel’s family, but was stopped by her mother before he could sneak out.  “Jack” she said, “wouldn’t you like to meet your son?”  And slowly from behind Rachel’s mom’s leg, a slim, blonde haired, nine year old boy walked out.  “This is Jonathan” Rachel’s mom said slowly, “he’s been waiting to meet you”.

Door? No. A door is used to go one place to another and as far as p456 knew, that was no door.

When they opened,  he was back to staring. But now,  as he looked down at his grey one peice,  which now was soaked in sweat,  he began to feel frightened. He stood and scanned the room.

His right arm spasmed and he laughed. p456 decided to ram his head into the stone. He knelt laughing histarically. He leaned low then pulled back and slammed his head onto the grey stone. Again and again and again and again and again. His vision was the first to go. It was just after his jaw shattered to about 23 pieces. After his vision went it was about 2 more blows until he lost control of his body. He tumbled over onto his back. The skin on his head torn open and bleeding profusel. He chuckled and laughed.

Before long stones, bottles and anything else within reach was flung. These objects battered their targets like a hailstorm. The already broken SWAT and police force crumbled under this barrage. The few men who had chosen to remain in uniform began to route in the presence of this violent and seemingly innumerable crowd.
 A few of D.C.’s finest attempted to hold their ground by any means necessary. At first they used pepper spray and tear gas; as the crowd continued to advance they used their riot shields and clubs; still the crowd advanced and the remaining forces opened fire with their weapons. However, for every person they gunned down ten more swept up into their place. The bullets may as well have been fired into a rushing tide. Those men and women who chose to stay were quickly overwhelmed. They would not be left alive. Any who challenged the crowd were killed by the enraged beast it had become. Before long people swarmed into the capitol. Seats, long evacuated by elected officials were torn apart. Offices desecrated. Flags burned. 
A lone official remained in his office. Congressman Pace. He had been elected to his fourth term in the last election. He was a Representative from Georgia who had one of the highest approval ratings in the House. He sat in his chair, turned towards the growing dusk. His window was open a crack. It was a lovely evening for March. He closed his eyes, shut out the screams of pain and sounds of destruction.  His mind wandered to his ranch in Georgia. The ranch he would never again see. The grass he would never again feel. The sun he would never again bask in. He almost smiled as these happy thoughts flooded him. He was shut from the world and could only think about the dark that gleamed around him. The Congressman was awoken from his trance as he heard what must have been air force one fleeing the nation’s capitol. He closed his eyes once more and returned to his meditation. 
A gunshot sounded from out the Congressman’s office and still he did not flinch. His door burst down suddenly as three rioters pushed a Secret Service agent through it. They beat him with pipes until his cries ceased. The rioters stopped for a moment in the office. All the former Congressman could think of was how they had been too late to see the view. Darkness had now descended. 
“Tyrant!” one of the rioters screamed through his bandana. He leaped over a table seeking his prey. Congressman Pace lay as 
His death was not quick. He did not die painlessly. This often is the case when a government falls. He died with his hand over his American flag lapel pin. 

The riot did not solely occur at the capitol. All of D.C. was under attack. After the riot at the capitol turned into a warzone the other riots quickly broke out into violence. The White House was besieged as the President was flown out to an undisclosed location somewhere in the Midwest. The portrait of George Washington that had hung for centuries, was protected from fire and war, would not see it through the night. This painting of the stoic founding father who wanted nothing more than equality for citizens would burn, as would all of the other relics stored in the President’s residence. A mob cheered as they watched flames engulf the White House for a second time in the nation’s history. 
The destruction of the National Archives was made into a spectacle. Documents including the Constitution and Declaration of Independence were read before the crowd. Each word, originally crafted to provide for natural rights, chosen so specifically so that people of this once proud nation would know that they were entitled to freedom, was now being twisted to reveal ironic and biting meanings. The reader sneered at the end of every sentence but did not add his own interjections. The crowed jeered and booed the words. The speaker did not make it through the first page before he gave up on turning its meaning and threw it into the crowd where these once revered words were torn apart near instantly. 
Crowds formed all over the mall. People looted businesses, robbed others and destroyed the landscape and property. Just as Nero with Rome, the people cheered as their city burned.

	“Sure I can” Billy claims, loading his slingshot, a small can of Bush’s beans sits atop a junkyard car about thirty yards away.
	Billy has always been the best shot in the neighborhood, but this time he may have overestimated himself. He stuck his tongue out, and pulled the stiff elastic back, a marble sized rock awaited blastoff.
 He was ready when “Billy Ray!” came  from their trailer down the road. “coming mom!” he stood up, flimsily letting the rock go. Flying nowhere near the can.
	“Told ya’ so” Tommy smirks.
	“Didn’t count” Billy whines.
	Running side by side back to their trailer these two brothers have the iconic “Did not”, “did too” argument. 
	Billy and Tommy sit in the back of the trailer where a limestone table is surrounded by a blue stained booth. Rust peppers the sides of the oversized van, the steps are sharp and dirty, lockjaw waiting to happen. The cabinets hang off their hinges, the sink is full of small insects and dirty dishes. It has a back bed room where the mother and whomever else she brings home stays. The two bunk-beds outside the room are for the boys, but the mom doesn’t want the boys to stay there. The mom tricks for a living, so she bought them a tent the boys set up a couple hundred yards into the forest. 
	“Meatloaf and corn on the cob, Tommy’s favorite!” she exclaims. She is a good mother, just dealt a bad hand. She does what she can for the boys, but in rural Tennessee prostitution in the trailer parks is her only bargaining chip. Billy is big for his age, at 11 he towers at 5’6 and weighs 130 pounds. He is a pale boy with greasy blonde hair always molded under a Boston Bruins baseball cap. He can’t even tell ya’ where Boston is, but he found the hat in the trunk of an old Mustang in the Junkyard. He tells his friends it stands for Billy and with his temper, no one ever questions it.
Tommy is thirteen years old and stands 5’3 108 pounds. The mother tells the boys they have the same father and that he was off fighting in the war. Tommy knows his father was black but never brings  it up to his mom, he knows there is a reason she won’t tell him.
 Billy and Tommy race to wash their plastic plates in the sink. “Race ya’ to the tent!” Tommy pants as he grabs his knapsack and runs out the door.
	“No fair. Mom I wasn’t ready.” Billy cries.
	“Tommy get back here and brush your teeth.” She says as she holds onto the handrail and leans out the door. 
	“Mauuuuum.” Billy says walking head down towards the trailer.
	“Smack” Tommy hit Billy in the arm the second he got into range. Tommy might have been the runt but Billy had a severe case of little brother syndrome. 
	“Now I am going into town tonight. If you need anything go down to Buck’s and you can each spend five dollars. I don’t want y’all coming back to the trailer until the flag is out the window in the morning. Okay?”
	“Okay mom.” the boys say in haunting monotone unison.
	The boys are so used to this routine, they run out to Buck’s mini-mart and each grabbed a root-beer and a myriad of snack foods. Back in the tent, Billy says “what does mom do every night?” 
	Tommy of course knows how their mom makes her money but wasn’t about the be the one who breaks the “good ole’ mommy illusion” to an eleven year old. 
	“She has friends over. Ever since dad went to war, she needs people to talk to.”
	“What about us?”
	“Adults are different, adults talk about things that we haven’t learned yet.”
	“Like what?”
	“I don’t know, shut up and go to sleep.” 
The soundtrack of birds and crickets put the boys into a deep sleep. One giant Spider-man sleeping back carpeted the tent. Under blankets and starlight the boys were never bothered.
Until later that morning “ERRRRRRRRRR–VROOOOOM” woke up the boys. Billy and Tommy peeked out of their tent and saw a black Ford Expedition peel out of their drive way.
	“Can we go home?” Billy asks.
	“We have to wait for the flag first.”
	“But her friends are gone.”
	“Still momma needs to rest some from hanging out all night.”
But that old Coffee stained American flag, never flew again.

Why, do you ask? Leave it to personal opinion to tell you that life doesn't have a story line, a good guy, or a bad guy, and it could end mid sentence, or after three hundred pages. So with that said, meet Riley, Riley Mattheux. A quiet kid, with loud noises in his head. Didn't say a whole lot, but that doesn't mean he had nothing to say. He had a hard time speaking when put on the spot, driving peers and people affiliated with him absolutely crazy. He was gentleman, a little less of a scholar, and even less of a manly man. He would never break six foot tall, or know the luxury of having the opposite sex swoon over him. This is a transcript of my conversations with Riley, see how he starts off keeping to himself, and slowly opens up. I hope you all get to know him as well as i did.

Me: Good morning Riley, how are you doing this morning.

Riley: Im good.

Me: Just good?

Riley: Yeah.

Me: No elaboration on how well you slept or how the events of your morning affected your good mood? 

Riley: Any elaboration on how much you really wanna psycho-analyze me for your putrid tests?

Me: All I asked is how your morning was...

Riley: And ""good"" wasnt good enough? You asked me a question, and i answered it, in a timely manner, and directly, what else do you want from me?

Me: Well, I would like to have a normal conversation, without the hostility, and without you looking to deep into implications that do not exist. 

Riley: Okay then, continue.

Me: Well, what is it you like? Any hobbies, interests, passions?

Riley: Music is my passion.

Me: What kind of music do you enjoy?

Riley: I just said I love music, all music, there isn't a certain genre i love more than another, I appreciate art, I appreciate the emotions and the fullness of the heart that was poured into that little four minute composition. You can always tell a good song by how it makes you feel, it it doesnt make you feel anything, it's garbage. If you feel anger, sadness, happiness etc, then the artist has done what they were looking to do. Which is all anyone wants anyway, is the piece of mind know that they accomplished what they set out to do. 

Me: Wow, i wasn't expecting an answer that in depth.

Riley: I'm an in depth guy.

Me: I'm starting to see that.

Riley: Well i would hope so, you got four sets of eyes there to see it with. 

Me: Fair Enough. Im noticing that your answers to my questions are very black and white, is that how you view life?

Riley: As a matter of fact it is. It is yes or no, this or that, right or left, simple as that, when you start making things more complicated is when problems arise, whether it be a small or huge problem. Life isn't that hard of a thing to figure out, once you simplify it, all the complications become clear, still complex nonetheless. Its kinda like taking pre-calculus, you learn the hard complicated way to work all the problems out to get the same answer, as opposed to calculus, you learn why, instead of how, and sometimes knowing why is better than knowing how. 

Me: So, you are saying that everything is black and white, but your explanations as to why that is so is all colors of the rainbow. If its so simple, why does it require explaining? If it were as cake as you say, it would just require common sense to understand that nothing is as hard as we make it?

Riley: Sense, is not a common thing anymore. 

Me: Why do you say that?

Riley: What the hell do you mean, why do I say that? I say that because i believe it, if you have to ask, you are walking proof that sense is an uncommon trait. 

Me: Anger, Riley, watch it, I'm asking you why you believe that common sense is a dying trait. 

Riley: It doesnt matter why i believe anything, no one is going to care what i think. I tell you what though, if someone would just sit the fuck down, shut up, and listen, I have it figured out, as god as my witness, I have this life figured out, and how it works, and why it works, and why the path we are going down is gonna be the end, and a new beginning at the same time. 


After that, Riley got worked up, and left the room. I personally believe i can break to the inner core of this kid, there is something interesting that i am seeing, and something even more interesting that i have yet to see. Is anyone else interested in my future conversations with Riley? ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1dvewh,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1dvewh/emotions_overriding_configurations/,
1367725006.0,3,self.shortstories,1dpr63,The Important Package,leewoodlegend,5,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1dpr63/the_important_package/,"How had I never noticed how fresh the air here was? I took another deep breath, filling my lungs with crisp autumn. The voices of the tavern mixed pleasantly, a harmonious cacophony. Any other day so many people in my quiet seaside bar would greatly upset me, but this was a good day. I looked down at the stool next to me, where I’d sat my important package. Yes, today was the day I could feel it.


Other, more regular drinkers drained their lagers in flagons, but I was content with a simple pint. A nice frosty pint for me, thank you. The blonde serving the drinks had the most marvelous eyes, here blue or there green depending on which way they caught the light. Her hips were meant for children. She was an angel, even if she didn’t remember my name after a week straight of coming here. I saw her pleasant presence as a blessing, a sign that today was the day the seeds of my labors came to fruition.


I moved my hand to the next table and felt the brown paper wrapped around the package, the sculpted brass underneath, careful only to touch the edges, never disturbing the world I’d created within.


When my glass was near empty the lovely barmaid brought me another. A second time. A third time. A fourth. My head was swimming now, a pleasant buzz surrounded everything. Today was the day. One of the regular drinkers looked over to me and we locked eyes. I smiled. He raised his flagon. I raised my pint and we toasted silently. I’d like to think he wished me all the best in my endeavors. It made two of us.


I heard the door open and close and I looked up to see the most beautiful creature. She was from southern France, maybe Spain, judging by the dark tones of her skin. Her raven hair tumbled just to her shoulder blades and danced around her neck and back as she walked towards the bar. I wasn’t the only man in the room checking the placement of my jaw, I assure you.


But it was I, with the dumb smile on my face, who she came and sat down with. I won’t deny giving a smug look to the regular drinkers with their large flagons. Face to face she was almost too wonderful for words. She was brisk, plump, and jolly, and ever so slightly past her nineteenth birthday. She was open and honest to a complete stranger, a man she’d never even met. It was as if fate directed her to me, she said.


I was caught between wondering why such a beautiful girl would sit with me and amazement that she was speaking my language so fluently. She was a Spaniard, I noted from her accent.


Before I was even able to open my mouth to tell her my name (and I had to tell her more than once because she kept forgetting it), she was telling me of her grand plans. She had traveled this far alone after running away from her father. An alcoholic, prone to fits of anger, but he hadn’t always been that way. The death of her mother took a horrible toll on a previously gentle and loving family man, she’d said. She was going to continue north, keep seeing the world until she decided she was ready to settle down.


She didn’t know where or when or with whom, but she figured when the time was right, she’d be ready for anything.


“And how do you know the time is not now?” I asked her.


“Because I know.” She said, and she held my gaze for a long time.


“Then why are you here?”


“Because of all the men in this room, you are the only one with destiny about you.”


She could feel it too. The day itself was smiling on me, what could possibly go wrong?


“I’m glad to hear you say that,” I admitted to her. “Today I am delivering this important package.” I motioned to the seat next to me. “Once I have delivered this, my whole life will change. I will have fame and fortune and everything my heart desires.”


She smiled. I smiled. We smiled and laughed and drank. We toasted to destiny. And then she put her hand on my arm.


She sucked in air. Her eyes went white and wide and wild. When her pupils came back, she was breathing in ragged gasps, and her eyes darted around. She wouldn’t make eye contact with me.


“Are you okay?” I asked her, grabbing her lightly by the shoulders.


She shook me off violently and stood up. “You…what are you? What 
darkness? What evil?” Tears were running down her cheeks. Her breaths came as sobs


“What in Hell are you talking about?” I demanded.


“Murderer!” She cried.


“I’ve never harmed anyone! Anything!”


“You will.” Her sobbing increased. The regular drinkers had first assumed I was harassing the poor girl, but they began to see the truth of her fit of insanity. “Oh God be good, you will.” And with that she ran out the door.


The room burst in to laughter. Everyone but me. I took a moment to collect my thoughts as I paid my tab and finished my last pint. I shook off the haunting feeling the young Spaniard had left me with. An anxiety. A pox on my perfect day. By sheer force of will I managed to convince myself to forget the whole thing. She was nothing more than a crazy girl. It might even have been her idea of a funny joke. Best not to dwell on such things.


Especially not on such an important day. I retrieved the package from the seat next to me. This thing was going to change my life. This was the one. No more failures. No more rejections. This was the best painting I’d ever done in my life.


It was mid-autumn in Vienna, eight years since the turn of the twentieth century, almost six months to the day ‘til my birthday. This was my day. Destiny awaited. And though I had spent my life thus far in obscurity, I knew that after today nothing would ever be the same.


No one would ever forget my name again.

1367449843.0,4,self.shortstories,1diiq2,A Dream I Had About The Afterlife.,purplestories,4,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1diiq2/a_dream_i_had_about_the_afterlife/,"Last night I dreamed that I had died. It wasn't the normal kind of dream. It wasn't the kind of dream that you wake up enthralled, afraid or tearful from. It was something deeper than that.
When I died, there was no white light to walk toward; no staircase in the clouds; no golden gate atop them; no heavenly chorus scoring each and every one of my footsteps, as if each one of them pounded on the drums of destiny; no heart; no passion; no feeling that every breath I took in my mortal life led to this moment, and that now my dreams were coming true, and I was ascending towards everlasting glory.

There was none of that.

But equally there was no fear. There was no anxiety, or panic, or hopelessness. The four emotions I had forever associated with death. The emotions that had left my mind crippled, contemplating other alternatives to constantly living with the big day forever looming over me. Emotions that had rendered me useless, unable to function, wondering what the fuck we are doing on this planet, and why something as spectacular as life on earth, with its inconceivable beauty and ability to emote human euphoria, could have such a terrifying and mind numbing opposite as death, and how we could know so little about it other than at its existential core, it is nothing but the absence of life in a previously living body.

No. Instead of fear or euphoria, there was realism. Quite frankly, there was no commotion. I had died in a hospital, in a small room, my family surrounding me as I lay in a bed drifting off courtesy of an incurable disease, as so many have done before me, and so many will do after. As I faded I felt my woes fade also. I don't think we realise it when our lives are so busy, but we always have our woes or problems on our mind, we just don't notice them as much. I thought about my family and friends. They held hands and sobbed around my bedside, knowing they were witnessing the last moments of my human life. I guessed that I should have been worrying about them, how they would cope without me, but three familiar words kept circulating in my head. Life goes on. Life would go on for them. They would be sad, but they would find closure, and then eventually it would be their time to go too. None of these things worried me. I had always pondered the afterlife, and by this point I had accepted that I would either see them again, or that I wouldn't need to. I understood that love transcends life.

And then it happened; though it didn't happen instantly. Throughout life I had always imagined that the moment of death would be similar to an abrupt power-outage, where in a split second, darkness would engulf everything. But it wasn't. It was a gradual process and I wasn't quite sure when life had ended, and whatever came next had begun. Those around my bed began to leave the room. They left in an orderly fashion, as if it had previously been decided how they would do so. First, my four best friends. Second my brothers and their wives, my sister, her husband and their children. My grandmother, and finally my mother and father. Each of them did so matter-of-factly, and that was the first sign that I may have passed over, as I'm sure in normal circumstances they would be crying and mourning uncontrollably. Instead, each of them just left. Some of them held my hand before leaving, and others kissed my forehead. And then, just like that, I was alone, albeit for just a few seconds. 

It was in this moment that I realised that I was witnessing my death out of body. I was standing in the corner watching this happen, not lying in the bed. And then I realised that I now had a purpose. I sat at a table in the middle of the room. It was small and there were only two chairs. The version of myself that I had just been watching got out of bed and sat at the table also. I was sitting across the table from myself. Somehow looking into my own eyes and staring back at them at the same time. Only when you look into your own eyes can you comprehend your existence. And then we talked for what felt like an hour, and yet it could have lasted for a thousand years because any comprehension that I had of time in my human life had faded, and I began to think that maybe time didn't exist anymore. We talked about the life I had lived on earth, about the relationships I had formed and the feelings I had had, what I had achieved in life, and what mark I had left on the earth. And then I asked myself what was going to happen next, and of course didn't know the answer.

Just as quickly as I had realised what my role was in my own passing over ceremony, I became clueless even faster. And there I was. At a table with another person, and yet somehow completely alone simultaneously; with the most pondered question of all time, and not a single answer. I closed my eyes and breathed in. I took two more, long, similar breaths, and I held the last one. I opened my eyes.
And then I saw everything. Every sunrise and sunset from every possible corner of the earth. Every flower that had ever bloomed, every tree that had ever grown, every mountain that had ever been conquered. Every creature on land, in the sky and in the oceans. Every man who had ever made his dreams come true and every woman who had ever accomplished her greatest feat. Every new-born baby that had ever been born, potential in their eyes. I experienced every sensation that could ever be felt, and heard every note that had ever been played, I tasted success, I smelled hope and in all of these things combined I saw the face of God.

I awoke in my bed and questioned my own existence again. As I write this I am still unaware of what my dream means. I believe that we are more than skin and bones. I believe that our bodies are nothing but vessels, and I believe that our souls are always yearning to escape them. I am unsure of the afterlife, and I wonder whether or not this life on earth is simply the afterlife to a previous one; that maybe every life is an afterlife and in each one we are promised something different for the next. I wonder how many times I have died before, I wonder how many times I will die again, and I wonder whether or not there is some end to this cycle. The only thing we can be sure of is death, for without death there is no life. There cannot be one without the other, but I do not believe that birth is the beginning and death the end. Until it is my time to become knowledgeable of what is next to come, I will just keep dreaming.

What Mr. Edward does not understand is why there is still an image left of himself after all these years?  
Every day he wakes up, looks himself in the mirror, stares deep into the eyes of this stranger, takes his gun out and shoots himself in the mirror. Some days he would do this joyfully with a sneer on his face and kills his image, other days he would just shoot himself mercilessly as he repentantly despises this image of himself, counting all the days that led to this revolting moment.  
Every day he would repeat this morning ritual, but he could see his thoughts having a deeper effect. He saw cracks appearing on his mirror as if it couldn't bear such suicidal thoughts anymore, another day he could see his image vanish for a moment or two, but he thought all of these could be delusions of his exhausted mind.
It was a dark and cold day of September; Mr. Edward woke up, took his gun out, walked to the mirror, looked at himself with mournful eyes in the mirror; but as he tried to reach for his gun he found himself in a dreadful situation, there was a stranger with a gun pointed at him! This was no ordinary stranger, he resembled himself, he was the same size and height of Mr. Edward but he was more like a silhouette, a silhouette made of all the hatred and fears that he put on the mirror for years. It was his own image, standing in front of him with his own gun pointed at him. What used to be a mirror image was now alive and this creature who used to be a reflection of himself had unveiled its mask and came to reality with its fearful face. He took a step forward; Mr. Edward could feel the bleak breath of this ghastly creature on his face. He was paralyzed by his own very thoughts, he remembered his childhood and all the moments he played in front of the mirror, he could not believe that there was a monster hiding behind his image for all these years. He came face to face with Mr. Edward and repeated these words ""Smile"", Mr. Edward stood still he could not understand the demand of this monster. ""Smile"" shouted the monster , Mr. Edward smiled with all the fear in his heart, his image was satisfied and vanished; And so Mr. Edward smiled whenever he saw his image, he smiled every morning, he smiled when he met someone, he could see his image following him everywhere, even in other people's eyes. Mr. Edward’s image paid him more visits, every time with something new, he gave him a tie to wear every day, a suit to match his smile and a hat to hide all his fears. For years he obeyed every wish of his image. He was no more afraid of his image and started to see the beauty hiding behind his master. Mr. Edward had become the perfect man.

I lost, but I liked this story so I figured I'd get some more opinions. Besides, just losing doesn't tell me how to improve.

Kosmonaut

Peace. Bleak, black, emptiness. Is there anything more to life than that?

I have been circling Earth for months now. I once knew what it was like on the surface. Going day to day, ambling from work to home and home to work. No thought, no excitement. Just life. I once thought there was nothing more than that. But now, seeing the universe and all of its glory from my minuscule metallic prison, I can see that I was wrong. 

I feel I am a lost sentinel, a castaway guardian of the earth. Silently I watch as burning stars and glowing satellites fly past me. I observe everything, and nothing will touch me. Nothing can surpass me; and nothing has or ever will. I am the sole caretaker of the universe. I can see into the oblivion and sense and feel all that is around me. There is nothing I cannot bear witness to. The cold metal box I call home is the only barrier between me and the beyond. It is my citadel, my prison and my liberation. I cannot be touched by anything, only enlightenment. It is wonderful.

Floating weightlessly through my metal cocoon, I can stare into the vastness of space and know that I am alone and yet not alone. I can be no more alone anywhere than in space, thousands of miles from earth. Not a voice heard but my own; even my radio has died. The only face I see is in the mirror. I am only touched by filtered air. And yet being so close to worlds I do not know gives me hope that I am not as alone as I appear to be. The vastness that I view bestows upon me the knowledge of life not yet seen. I can feel it. 

I look out the windows, beyond the fogged glass, and see nearly eternal blackness. There is no day in space. There is only light from one window, the one facing the sun. Perpetual sun. No setting. No night and no day. Out the other window, I can see into eternity. Every shining star, every galaxy and asteroid, every single speck of glowing space. I can see it all. And it is beautiful. 

I realize my time in heaven is coming to an end. My mission was slated for only a year. That time bled away in an instant. A blink of an eye, and I am being taken away. A minuscule fish in a vast sea, being reeled in on a hook and line. Too soon. Too soon.

Knowing that I will lose my endless bliss is difficult to bear. As I sit and stare through the glass, I ponder ways of staying. I have no radio to contact Earth. Mankind is nonexistent here.

I am due back home in just a week's time. But there is no home to return to. I have thought long and hard about my life, both free and earth bound. Now, I don my suit. 

Bound to my metal prison, I drift into nothingness. Through my visor I can see the stars and galaxies clearer than ever before. They surround me. I am not behind them; they are not in front of me. I am within them. I feel the strongest sense of peace and belonging. I am in nothing and nothing is in me. I am eternity.

I feel a tug as I reach the end of my tether. I detach the clip from my belt.

I am swimming in a sea of emptiness. The stars are all within sight, but never within my grasp. I can feel the weight of time pressing heavy on my chest. Eons bore through my skull. A millennia passes before my eyes. My life is irrelevant. I cherish it.

My angle changes, the earth covers the stars. One cloud covers most of the land; a milky charcoal mass smothering green life. Oceans, radiant blue against the blackness of space. Life on earth is rendered invisible. Insignificant. Nothing compares to the universe.

I can see into space and time. I am falling into oblivion. I can see my space pod drift away from me. All is gone. I am at peace. I am nothing and I am everything. I am eternity. Just before I drift out of sight, I hear the soft echo of radio static.

_____________________________________

I know he dreams of me, as I dream of him, but only in awakening. He whispers me sweet lies, he tells me about the endless possibilities, about the cyan skies and the crimson seas. He tells me about the friends I will have, the family I will love, and the memories I will share. He tells me every about myself, from what I know and from what I do not know. He tells me of my deepest desires, of everything I want. He talks about my hair, my skin, and my toes. The books I have read and the book I will write. He lives for me only.

He is cold to the touch made of steel. I put him on my back and we go everywhere but yet nowhere at the same time. We run as fast as we can, but barely move an inch. We talk into the endless night, but barely say a word. Although he can’t move, he brightens up when ever he sees me. He always sees me.

There are promises of silver and garnets, of marble castles and knights of bold. He tells me about monsters and kings, about where we will walk and what we will sing. He has seen the future, he has seen the past, and he assures me that all will last. He tells me about how fair things could be.

But I know these to be not.
As he is the lying robot.

 You drew a map on a white napkin and told me how there are always more feet than will go into a mile, more inches than will make a foot, about every edge. Achilles was in it and some slow thing, a turtle perhaps, or a snail. 
 But these were only masks for numbers, and I grew tired of Achilles and his logarithms, and we went to the beach. 



 The dew was on the rocks and the tide was out and there were soft things quaking in the horrible light. There is so much death at the edges, I said.


 Everything lives at the edges. You frowned at me like a stormcloud. You spoke of ecotones and cusps and crises. I saw your fingers rubbing chalkdust, shedding the imagined detritus of a hundred dusty lectures. 


 I listened while the sun sneaked through your curls and warmed my arms like your hands on a cold morning. I rubbed my board with the pale bitter wax that smells like violins and tobacco and burns if you get it in your eyes. 


 Then I painted you with coconut oil and lemon where we hid behind the big red parasol, and your breasts rose and fell like the pears on the windrow by the seawall, your fingers espaliered a small blossom. 


 I left you there on the green striped towel with your books and sunglasses, your tea and the basket of boiled eggs and sandwiches and the last of the fig newtons. And I went to the ocean.



 (I dreamt out there, did I tell you?)



 The place where the sea and the earth and the air touch, I touched too, making a moist track, and we were like sisters meeting or like four old lovers, sleeping side by side in a tent with the moon watching, or like both of those things loving each other and jealous at the same time. 


 I have heard of the surf marching forward, of the waves battering the earth and retreating, sending forays against the sand and being hurled back. 
 This is a man thing, I thought.


 We who have lain at the point where the dry becomes the wet know that these are kisses and caresses, and the thrusts and tumblings have no martial intent. All living things are born from this meeting, into the bright air. We gasp, we burn, we die and return, whether to earth or sea.



 (Your thoughts were not lost out there, you see?) 



 I hold them in my head when I let the dreams take me, and we do not disagree.



 The thing about edges, I liked. Everything that really lives, lives at the edge of something, you said, and I saw a bead rolling between two widening wires, always about to fall, and somehow never doing it. Always moving forward, and rising and declining imperceptibly, as the world carries it onward.



 Benoit, you said, and ecotone. I liked the words, but you never told me what they mean, unless I was listening to the gulls or the surf or the soft murmur of your pulse beneath my hand. 



The wind shook your blue hat, and I got you a green lounge from the old man who made the umbrellas for the wind to break and drag across the foreshore like tattered dreamthings. 

 Like the birds of wakening, that watched us from the long rusted rails above the seawall and there was a tall girl at the bar who said that the sun was in your hair and I hated her for seeing it and for seeing you smile, and loved her for knowing the same things that I knew.



The heartbeat of the world you called it, the surf you meant, and the tall girl brought us crab legs and you talked a while about the things that come out of the sea. 

 The hermit crabs and the robbers, the tiny sidling fingernail crabs that run away from motion like a child who fears strangers, straggling behind the skirts of the seawrack peeping bashfully out. 


 And the great ghost crabs; the grey and shining grandmothers twitching their long braches like blind man’s sticks through the pebbles toward the tidepools, with the moon in their eyes.


 They love the sun, but the moon is their mistress - you told me this, and asked me:

 ""Have I told you that the sea is made of blood? It's true; but the blood is stronger now that it was when we left."" 

 I knew you did not mean ourselves, but some lost frightened fossil, living again for a moment in the tide behind your eyes. 



 We swam then, and you moved back and forth through the break like an otter, and then the boarders came down the long stair and waited till we came out before charging like whooping soldiers into that great onslaught that neither marked them nor wavered.



 Under the rusting nod of the lotus pod spigot you turned and turned and lost the scent of our mother the ocean, and smelled like you and the sun and the cocoa butter sunscreen I had bought from the old man with the red hat. 


 Blind, you said, but he saw you, as the earth and the ocean and the sky see you now. As the fire saw you then, lapping lights across your sand dusted hip, limning out our vagrant silhouettes upon the moist earth.



 (I thought I held you that night in the tent, but it was not you, was it?)



 Beneath their lids your eyes were watching the pale circles of the gulls, reaching with their wings for the earth as the sky drew them back in the direction of the invisible stars.



 The next day I rode to the top of the break and found a wave waiting; a terrible thing as green and clear and bubbled as the bottom of an antique bottle. 



 And I was up and I was in it and the board was a tongue in the mouth of the ocean, and I was for a while that thing which you were always:

 
 Caught between the air and the sky, driving forward into time, unmoving, until the ocean cast me out and dropped me at your feet, and we showered and you combed out my hair and we had breakfast. 



 (These are the things I remember, in this dim place beneath the trees, where the ocean has not been these million lifetimes.)



 (Still), within your eyes, i think I am there, that I will always live there, on the edge between memory and dream, with the bright birds and the grey skies, turning, rising like the wave, and hanging in that place within your mind, where standing still we rise, and rising, turn, and fall, and are falling, now. Forever.

1365720549.0,6,self.shortstories,1c61cc,Broken,,6,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1c61cc/broken/,"Okay Reddit. First time I'm posting something to an audience outside of my small circle of friends. Hope you like it. I'm from India so you have the references here and there. Shouldn't stop you from getting it, though. Hope you like it :)

This story formed itself on three separate occasions and was finally written on a cold winter day on a Lutyens' Delhi building's terrace. It became more special after I recited it to someone immediately after its completion. Not very often do I get to read stories out but for the one time I did, it sure feels good. This story for me (like the others) is like winter. Cold, numb fingers and dull aches, but some warmth inside, and just about enough. I hope you like it :)

 

""Do ghosts live on Peepul trees?"" I ask, peering across the terrace into the hazy silhouette of a clump of trees far away. The winter sun trying its best to warm my bones against the chilly wind that plays with my messy hair. ""Ghosts and Gods both."" says my aunt knowingly as she pours me yet another cup of strong, milky tea. A mug, rather. I warm my numb fingers on it. I am cold. I'm in a village for all practical purposes. My phone does not work here, buffaloes sit lazily basking in the faded sun, children quarrel over a game of marbles, and a twenty-year-old misfit sips tea sitting on a cot.

 

Needless to say, this is not my natural habitat. For one, I can see the sky in all its sprawling, blue glory. Two birds skip off the draft and dive one after the other to swoop onto some unknowing prey. Somewhere, a rooster crows, which is quite odd for two o clock in the afternoon. Also odd for this time of the day is the cold that seeps through to my bones. I tell my aunt about life in the city. She listens wide-eyed. She cannot fathom the coldness of it all, the steel and glass prison that I work in, the dreadful fact that I know exactly how each day is going to be. She does not understand how free I feel here without my cell phone chaining me like an invisible umbilical cord, how clear the air here is without a thousand conversations riding the airwaves form tower to tower. All is well in my world though, as she pours me yet another cup of tea. I smile. Family.

 

As the clock strikes four, children start pouring into the terrace. My cousin sister, all of nineteen, is the neighbourhood teacher, a prestigious title earned through months of reading aloud the alphabet, teaching children to dot their i's and cross their t's and much red ink spread over her soft palms. The children eye me suspiciously. After a while they decide I'm no threat and a couple of them greet me. ""Good Morning, Sir!"" they say in that sing song chorus I used to be a part of, long back. I smile again.

 

This class is quite different from any I have seen. The children, aging from five to ten, do not sit still. They laugh and cry freely. They sing their lessons. Some are struggling to hold pencils while some are proud to be old enough to wield pens, prized possessions no doubt for those little fingers. It is, in a way, like an overgrown garden. Disordered and chaotic but oh, so beautiful.

 

One little boy stands out, though. There's something strange about him even in this scene which is none too familiar to me. He takes and exceptionally long time to write. I kneel next to him and peer into his notebook, bound with thread. All the words are misspelt, the letters are fractured,misshapen little creatures, and the boy's face is a mixture of confusion and terror. I look at my sister with concern. She nods silently and tells the class to write numeral to a hundred. She walks over to me and looks into his book. Then she looks at me, her eyes full of exasperation and silent despair. ""There's something wrong with him."" she says, the winter haze making its way into her voice. ""He's just slow to learn. He's not too rich. His father was supposed to come see me today."" She looks at him with sadness. He merely smiles as he squints into the sun. ""Take care of him will you?"" she says and leaves me with him.

 

I am now a helpless subject of the boy's scrutiny. he squints at me face, the winter sun giving me a halo. I try to smile, but it falters. This will not go well, I think. I need something to say, to engage his mind, so much more free than mine. ""Do you like aeroplanes? I ask him , finding my saviour in a flash of supposed brilliance. ""Planes."" he says after a couple of seconds of incomprehension, his face lighting up. ""Planes!"" he says again, his hands tracing a flight path, cutting through the cold air. ""Let's make one!"" I say with poorly disguised relief and I tear out two pages from his notebook and give him one. I make the first folds quickly, my fingers using their own memory saved from eons ago when I used to fly. He sits there confused, his fingers not grasping the movements, ever so slightly out of his control. I repeat slowly. He follows this time. He laughs clearly as he does and the air is warmer, if only by a fraction.

 

As his small hands struggle to give life to the piece of paper, I see him deep in penance, wanting nothing more to bend the paper and his own limbs to his will. Ages pass by with me lost in the slow dance his fingers play with the paper, becoming more and more refined until he makes the final fold with all the grace of a finishing pirouette. As we walk to the boundary I silently pray that it flies well, to some unknown tree-dwelling deity, lord of planes and the winter wind.

The child blows into the paper plane in a ritual he is sure will lend it magical wings, and jumps slightly as he releases it into the vast, cold expanse of air.

 

And it flies majestically, circling us and riding a draft into a slow dive reminiscent of the two birds, then stalling, then diving again and continuing its graceful pirouette as the boy's wide eyes follow it in flight, even as he dives and stalls with the plane, no longer bound by his form, and having lived its short life with the grace of a dying star, the plane lands on a buffalo sitting some distance away. The animal merely grunts and goes promptly back to chewing its cud, a business more important than all the machinations of this world.

 

I look at him. He is laughing. He is in fits. ""You did well."" is all I can muster. I ruffle his hair gleaming brown in the sun, and he nods with twinkling eyes. I turn around to see an old man, whose eyes tell me he is the father. ""He did well."" I say weakly to him. He merely nods, other gestures being foreign to him. He picks the child up into his arms, never too weak for his son. Then he looks at me with a smile and moist eyes. I cannot look away. They are too deep for me to swim away.

My mind goes back five years when I had returned with my examination results to my father. ""You could have done better."" was all he had said. I remember sitting there under the same sun with the result sheep in my hand, a piece of paper that would never, ever fly.

I look at the child and his father again. It's not cold anymore. The wind stands still as if in respect, and for a moment the sun shines brighter.

Then it hits me .

The boy isn't broken.

I am.

I walk away silently and gaze across the open fields into infinity until my eyes are moist.

Perhaps it is just the cold wind.

First, a little background info: I published a short story on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble a while back, but I didn't see much traffic outside of my own circle of friends and family. As a self-published writer, that is about what I expected.

I didn't make much of an effort to publicize the story when it was initially posted, and I've regretted that. In an effort to give myself a bit more visibility, I wanted to post a preview of the story on a few sites...just to see what happens.

""Paradox"" is the story of a man's descent into madness as he struggles to alter the fate of his only daughter.

**WARNING:** This story is bitter and rather dark. There is quite a bit of profanity and it is not suitable for children. You've been warned.

&gt;__________________________________________________

&gt;The Paradox has one rule: Don’t interfere. Don’t be a hero; don’t change the world. Just follow your path. Break that rule, and the clock resets. He shows up with that stupid grin and damned pocket watch.

&gt;“Time’s up, Mr. Paradox. Let’s try this again, shall we?”

&gt;One click and back we go; back to that tiny, whitewashed room...the room that smells like death every damn time. I know what’s coming. My wife is in tears, the doctor mumbles some soothing bullshit, and my little girl is lying there with tubes and wires strung across every inch of her fragile little body, and all the while that cocky prick stares back at me dangling that fucking watch over my baby’s head.

&gt;“Tick-Tock, Mr. Paradox. Time is running out.”

&gt;Her body shudders, her heart races for an instant, and then nothing. Nothing but that sound; that ear-splitting screech that can only mean one thing: she’s gone.

&gt;A moment passes, and then the air is filled with my wife and her frantic sobs. She begs...first the doctor...then God but it’s no use. There is no God, just the man behind the bed with his stupid grin and antique watch.

&gt;“Time’s up.” And just like that, he’s gone.

&gt;Do you have any idea how hard it is to bury your own child? Try doing it a thousand times.

&gt;It rained that day...always rains during a funeral. It’s almost as if nature isn't content stealing one life and decides to suck it out of everyone else. I don’t move, I don’t blink, I don’t even make a sound. I cried once, but after a thousand times, there are no tears, just cold, unadulterated rage.

&gt;So how does a man end up in my situation? My little girl was sick. Cancer. No one knows where it came from; she just woke up one morning and started to die. We tried everything; surgery, chemo, even some new age experimental procedure that only sped the damn thing up. And when we were finally out of options, we prayed.

&gt;My wife was the soft one. She asked God to intervene and show us His mercy. I didn't have time for that. I didn't ask for anything; I demanded it. My baby was on her death bed, and He needed to fix it. But the answer never came. Her heart stopped, and we buried her. We buried her in a coffin small enough for a house cat.

'Urgent.'
'National Security.'
'Nepal.'

His fingertips hovered above a small rectangle which would unleash hell. Again, the sharp voice cut through the mayhem on the bridge. „Commander, I need your acknowledgement. Purge it!"" Since the spaceship was already shaking from missile hit after missile hit, nobody noticed his trembling hand.  
His gaze wandered a little higher to the massive observation window. The curvature could clearly be seen, seperating ground and heaven. Ramsey remembered being down there once, sitting in a space port with some friends from the academy and listening to an interesting history talk.


He had purged a moon six months before. There were riots on the small colony Triton-4, and Benson had ordered the same command. It was just a small colony. But together with the eight other colonies on the moon they were building a new jumpgate in Neptun's orbit. The first one was fully operational and orbiting Uranus, about 12 billion spacemen had already traveled to their new homes a few dozen lightyears away. It was a slow process, and an expensive one. Luckily the people on the surfaces volunteered for the hard work – at least all the officers told so.


But now he was in doubt. A big fleet of construction ships was hovering near the sun, ready to install the solar panels for the giant Dyson sphere. Ramsey hadn't fully grasped the concept, but it was something like a bubble around the sun. It would still let some light pass through, but could harness the energy and solve all their energy problems.  
Somehow, the people down their didn't like that and broke the 70 year long peace by blowing two of the construction ships up. Things escalated quickly and a week later the Omega's weapon systems were programmed to destroy 500 million km², ready to tansform the surface into a billowing, red-glowing mass.


Their spaceship was built for only one thing: Annihilating surfaces. With a length of 327 meters it carried an arsenal of the most devastating weapons ever created, and after its deployment the third world war came to a grinding halt. That was 90 years ago, and while much bigger ships were built, all of them combined still couldn't match the unique firepower of the Omega.  
It was a tool of peace and stability, his captain said. Ramsey remembered watching the surface of Triton evaporate under their glowing beams and heavy bombardement, but he didn't feel peaceful at all. 


""Shield system critical"", the computer voice rattled. They could sustain the attack for another minute, maybe two. Unless he touched the small rectangle. But he couldn't do it. ""Captain, this is insane. We can't decide the fate of 9 billion people."" - ""We can, and we must. As they shot our unarmed construction ships down, they knew what they did. And you know what to to, acknowledge my order and purge those surfacemen!"" Captain Benson clenched her fist. ""Commander, now!""  
Surely she was right. Her orders came directly from the artificial intelligence, and it had never been wrong. If he touched the rectangle, he would be the hero of the day and the war was over. But if he didn't, the missiles from the surface would break their shield in a few seconds and then their armored hull in a few more. There was no more time to think. His finger jerked down.


In a millisecond, the computer scanned his DNA and initalized the launch process. ""Authentication phrase"", chattered the computer voice. Ramsey stared through the observation window at the soft glow of the atmosphere.   The authentication phrase glared in his thoughts like the sun. He chose it a long time ago, as he visited the planet. It was after a history talk – maybe an hour long and illustrated with lots of pictures. Beautiful pictures from the ancient times. Their history. Slowly, he uttered the authentication phrase. ""Earth ... is ... beautiful.""",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1adaai,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1adaai/i_dont_like_happy_ends_650_words/,

He wandered aimlessly. He didn’t think. Thinking took too much effort. He walked. Just walked, because that was all he could do. His phone was in his pocket and he endured the cold while he waited for it to ring. The breeze ran down the street and bit and tore until it worked its way into his skin. He was not walking to anywhere in particular or for any other reason than to stall. The streets were deserted and the park by the lake contained nothing but the geese lagging behind on their journey south. 
	
His mind trailed off. Where could she be? What could she be doing? When was the last time I saw her? Does she even want to see me? Am I simply just wasting my time? No, no, no he thought; don’t let your mind wonder off. Thinking hurts too much. She cannot just be gone without a goodbye or a mere fare thee well. 
	
Nine p.m. she said. We will go to the movies, and then have dinner. It would be wonderful but reality is never like your expectations.  

He approached the pond and walked down the hill till he was on the middle of it. He sat down and looked out across. It was calm except for the ripples caused by the wind. The silence was the best part. Silence was a commodity he longed for. He didn’t need everyone telling him that it would be alright, you need to get out some, she isn’t coming, but what did they know? 

Snow began falling. He and she were heading down the road one night. The winter storms had rolled in and the snow blinded their way as he drove. The tree lined road was interspersed with the occasional home or driveway leading deeper into the woods. The snow was so bad that it was near impossible to see more than twenty feet ahead, but the road he drove on, he had been on a thousand times and it was practically a straight line. Yet then he saw a blur dash in the road. Then he felt the wheels leave the ground and the crashing of glass and the crumple of steel and the cold air rushing in. The car pushed in around them forcing them closer together as it continued to tumble down the road until they came to a rest with his body pressed against hers with nowhere to move. The next moment he was in the snow with eyes looking over him as the cold embedded itself in his bones.


 He felt his phone in his pocket and looked at the time: ten-thirty. No missed messages, no missed calls, not anything. He put it away and stared at the light on the other side of the lake. He wrapped his hands around himself and stuck them under his arms to stay warm and waited for a call. Ten-forty-five. At ten-forty-five it finally arrives. The phone rings and he answers. Contempt, hate, rage, and longing coursed through him. He didn’t speak immediately. Control was important, nothing good comes from impulse. “Hello my dear. Is it as I fear? Will I still see you here?”


“No my love, I am coming now. I’m sorry, I am sorry I took so long. The people I was with just kept rambling on and on, like loons, but don’t be mad; I will be beside you soon.” 
	
A consolation time, being second, what else should one expect?  Don’t expect anything, no ever expected anything from him, so he was never disappointed. He said. “Okay then. It was your time, and never mine but yours to spend. I just thought it was on you that I could depend.”


He let the cold slip in further. His ears went numb, then his cheeks, and then his toes. Finally he stood up and proceeded home. He opened the door and the warmth hurried out. The couch welcomed him, and hugged around him when he sat down. Eleven o’clock his phone said now. Better late than never he thought. Then twelve came around. Then one, and then finally his eyes fell shut and he gave up. 


As the days wore on after the crash he slowly pieced together what happened while in a hospital bed until his memory finally returned and he was able to make sense of everything. Countless faces with sad, pitying smiles expressing halfhearted condolences and apologies paced through the room ceaselessly for days and days. He was constantly in the presence of the one or two who actually cared but they were of no help to him. He asked almost hourly how she was doing but in return he only received saddened faces and pitying looks that he so longed would just go away. Maybe deep down he knew what actually happened. Maybe one day he would be able to actually face it. His mind wouldn’t accept it though. Even when he was cleared to leave he would ask his friends if he could see her. 


It went on until people stopped being nice about it. They started shouting, they started to bluntly say what hurt him the most, and they no longer felt the need to give a reassuring lie because it was time to face what happened. It was of course for no use though. The shelter of his mind kept him warm and blanketed from the harsh unforgiving world around him. Then one day people just gave up. He was left to himself. People would show up occasionally but only to drop off food and other groceries. He was slowly being forgotten and left to be a part of the past.


One day though he received a phone call, “Hello my love, it’s been far too long. Will you be busy around nine so that we can dine and once again be fine? How about a movie or we can just be joyous and sing songs until morning’s dawn? I will be there then my dear, don’t fear.” The call ended just after and he was left bewildered but so happy to have heard her. He waited. He waited until nine had become ten and he could take it no more and he had to leave for a walk.


He woke up with hands running through his hair. Cold hands. He looked up and saw her. The smile crept across their faces as they stared. “Hello my love,” he said looking above, “why have you taken so long?”


“Because here my dear, is not where I belong. You have known this for far too long. Yet it appeared I must come along, to remind you that I am always here. I am always there. To be a reminder to you that things only get colder and harder, but never darker” 


“But my love you must explain. Why am I in so much pain? Why must you be so delayed?  I have love for you that cannot be swayed, but I would rather just end this masquerade. I would rather you just have always stayed.”


“And one day soon. That will happen for you. Though it may hurt, I promise you will just simply awake. With my hand in your hair and a smile in which we both partake, and I won’t be cold, I will be something you can actually hold. And be far more than Lenore or some forgotten lore. I will be yours.”


And then she was gone. He felt his head. It was still cold. He 
checked his phone and saw no calls. No messages. There was nothing at all. There was nothing at all to ease his mind. So he lay there, just trying not to think.  


For days after he stared at his phone in the hopes that she would call again. The phone though stayed blank with no calls, messages, or anything of the sort that would light up the screen. He couldn’t take it. He was just there with her. Once again he had her next to him for her to only disappear as before but this time he really was alone. He really didn’t have anyone. He was already become a part of the past. He belonged to a particular moment in time that he could not escape. There was nothing left for him here, so he went to join her.

1363134274.0,5,self.shortstories,1a6m8x,My robot nurse,Dont_Be_Stevens,8,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1a6m8x/my_robot_nurse/,"“Come here, Basil! Here, girl,” I whistled, unnecessarily, for my P.E.T. Basil wasn’t really programmed to respond to whistling, but she didn’t seem bothered by my habit. For me, the whistling just seemed natural when dealing with a dog. 

Basil, a 4th generation P.E.T, trotted into my bedroom, all twitching ears and tail. With a slight bend to her stubby back legs, she leaped onto my bed and nuzzled her head into my waiting hand. Despite my joy, I frowned slightly at the creaking I heard when she landed; I’d have to ask Marjorie to schedule a service call. 
I’d had Basil for about six months, in her current form. When I purchased the upgrade, the nice young salesman arranged for her personality to be downloaded into the new unit. The effect was such that the P.E.T I’d grown to love for almost four years got a new body. I don’t quite understand the technology, but the young man explained that P.E.Ts were designed with basic functionality, but each unit would learn and develop unique quirks based on their environment. Just like the dogs I remember from my youth, Basil had a personality all her own. Marjorie and I were terribly fond of her. 

Marjorie, my live-in caregiver, was a great help to me, of course. She’d been with me since illness and time had taken away my ability to move about the house on my own.  My mind is still sharp, thank Heaven, but I am not too proud to admit that I would not be able to manage without help. But for all that I appreciate Marjorie, I found myself getting lonely. Basil was the perfect solution. P.E.Ts are wondrous technology, designed to provide companionship without posing the health risks, or requiring the day-to-day maintenance, that a real animal does. And aside from their primary therapeutic function, they came with programs that assisted with managing the sick individual’s care; they dispensed medications at the set times, fetched necessary health equipment like bed pans or IVs, and so much more. 

“Amazing!” I said out loud, scratching  Basil behind her soft, furry, and always mite-free, ears. She lolled her perfectly pink tongue in a doggy smile that warmed my heart without spreading bacteria. 

“What was that, Mrs. Quent?” Marjorie followed the dog into the bed chamber, a tray in hand. 

“I was just marveling at the things we have these days! I feel so lucky to have lived when I did, Marjorie, to have been able to see things that earlier generations would never dream of. My parents, my grandparents, could never have imagined such a technological marvel as little Basil.” 

My nurse smiled indulgently, having heard me express similar thoughts countless times before. “I am just happy that Basil has made you so happy, Mrs. Quent. Now lay back and we’ll start your treatment, all right?” 

With the skill of a professional, Marjorie opened my night shirt and drew it aside to reveal my chest. As I settled into my pillows to relax, she wiped a disinfectant swab over the area before allowing the patiently waiting Basil to come closer once again. Basil settled onto my stomach with her little head on my exposed chest. Once I was comfortable, I nodded to Marjorie, who pressed the necessary code in Basil’s remote to initiate the treatment. Hypodermic needles, very thin and very sharp, revealed themselves in Basil’s mouth. Thanks to the numbing agent exuded by Basil’s tongue, I didn’t even feel the needles enter my flesh. A mechanism near the roof of Basil’s mouth began to hum, ever so softly, and I felt a familiar sucking sensation. My daily treatment takes approximately half an hour, the optimum timeframe recommended to balance the humors of the human body. While Marjorie and I waited for the Personal Exsanguination Therapist to finish removing my bad blood, I ran my hand over Basil’s little back. 

“Just amazing,” I murmured as the euphoria of a proper bloodletting settled in. “Such advances in technology and medicine we have these days!” I began to fall asleep.

The doctor was sitting at his desk, scribbling down some notes with his illegible doctor calligraphy on a scrap piece of paper. He let his hand take total control, swiftly moving up and down across the white sheet of paper. His mind was somewhere else. He was thinking about something. He had been thinking about it all day. Since he opened his eyes. Since his brain had fully activated itself. While he was having breakfast. While he was drinking his daily glass of O.J. While he was reading the newspaper on his precious eReader. While he smoked a cigarette on his petite balcony, puffing away in the cold winter air. The entire morning, he had been thinking of the previous day. The previous dinner, to be specific. Which happened about 10 hours earlier.

Dr. Francis heard a knock at his door.
""Come in"" he said, with a tone which was about to fall off the edge of politeness.
A short little man with tiny squinty eyes entered the room. Armed with a gigantic smile and a blatantly recognizable toupee', he said ""Hello, sir! What a pleasure to see you on this fine day!"" 
""Yes..."" replied Dr. Francis, trying to sound a tad less sad and gloomy than he actually was, ""a fine day indeed"".
While the pig-man jabbered on about his tooth aches and his head aches and his back aches, Dr. Francis nodded seemingly apprehensively, while playing, pausing, rewinding what he had been playing, pausing, rewinding for the entire morning.
  
He ate at Le Chateau Imperial. Last night of course. He didn't eat alone. He had company. Somebody very special. Not Darren, no. His one and only son, Darren, was far too busy to go out for dinner with his father, his biological father. He had serious business to take care of, which required most of his time, strength and energy.

""So what should I do?"" asked the pig-man, desperately trying to un-squint his eyes, as if the doctor's next words could only be seen and not heard.
Silence ate up the room, for a a couple of terrible, terrible seconds.
""Sir? Siiiir?""
Dr. Francis snapped back to reality. He paused the Blu-ray he was playing in his head. He left it there, in his HD DVD/Blu-Ray player which he had bought only a few months ago. Which Claire had begged for. Which was now stacking up dust, under his majestic LCD Television set.
""Yes, of course."" said Dr. Francis, showing his patient that he had been paying attention, and that he was about to grant the pig-man with a delightful solution to his problems. He told him to sleep more, to go out for walks (in this cold winter weather? What were you thinking Dr. Francis?), to have decent meals, to avoid junk food, and to take painkillers if the pain didn't subside.
 
""Thank you sir, I very much appreciate it."" said the squinting pig-man, cupping his hands together, humbly expressing his gratitude, like a plebeian at the feet of his lord.
 
Claire looked amazing last night. She wore a black dress, which Mr. Francis had carefully picked and bought for her previous birthday. It was sophisticated, yet it underlined Claire's natural curves, making her stand out in Le Chateau Imperial. She captured every male eye in the dining room, enveloping them in the black bliss which covered her voluptuous body. She gracefully walked towards Mr. Francis, her ex-husband, who immediately stood up as soon as she approached the table.

The pig-man stood up as well, thanked the doctor again, and shook his strong firm hand. The rat-man walked out of the office, while jollily shouting: ""See you next time sir, have a good one!""
Dr. Francis was finally alone. Alone with his thoughts. Alone with his paused Blu-ray. He let it play one more time.

He helped her sit down, like a true gentleman, fooling all the other men in the room into believing that she was his personal trophy-wife. Or trophy girlfriend. That he was the one that could pass his hands over her silky caramel skin. Only him. Nobody else.

""Hey honey!"" shouted Melissa.
""Honeeeeey!""
""What do you want?"" shouted back Dr. Francis, slightly irritated by the abrupt interruption.
""Do you want a coffee? Or maaaybe a cappuccinoooo?"" shouted Melissa with her benign but rather fastidious high rising terminal.
Dr. Francis pictured her sitting on her leather chair, behind the counter of the reception, slightly leaning towards his door. She was very young, much younger than him. She was in her early twenties, full of life and libido, full of the desire to live, do things, go places.
""I'll have a coffee, thanks. Black!"" shouted Dr. Francis, picturing Melissa's looong red hair, and her looong soft legs, sitting there, only a few meters away from him. Only a white glass door with a light brown border separated them.

""Oookay sweetie!"" happily answered the girl, probably smiling at him behind that door, with her big warm smile inhabited by a perfect set of candid precious jewels.
Only a few meters and the door separated them now.
Only a few centimeters of air separated them 5 weeks ago.
Only a few centimeters.

They were lying on her bed.
Naked.
Breathing softly.
Both staring at the ceiling.
Not really looking at it, but just letting their eyes rest in one spot.

Melissa opened the door and walked into Dr. Francis' office.
She handed the cup of coffee to the doctor and said ""Here you go, Dr. Francis"" winking while pronouncing the sibilant ""s"" of Francisss.
He thanked her with a smile, and romantically shooed her away.
""Damn, she's gorgeous"" he thought, while his personal secretary walked out of his office, gently shaking her cunning caboose from side to side, the sexiest and most hypnotizing pendulum you'll ever see.

The Blu-ray un-paused.

It was a different scene.
It wasn't in the restaurant.
Not in Le Chateau Imperial.
Oh no.
It was in his office.
On the patient's bed. The type of bed with a large roll of Scottex at the top of it, so that each patient gets a personal and exclusive strip of Scottex. So that they don't end up sitting or touching where some other filthy patient sat or placed his body parts upon.
She was on the bed.
The Scottex was all crunched up.
Her soft derriere was on the dark blue leather of the bed. The leather was cold. Smooth, but cold.
He was standing in front of her.
Her legs were on his shoulders.
He was holding them.
Holding her thighs.
Her marble thighs.
His pants were down to his feet, clumsily resting on his polished Cesare Paciottis.
His shirt was on the ground, lying there where he threw it, looking at him with a scrumpled look.
She wasn't wearing much.
Her black skirt was somewhere on the cold floor.
Her white shirt was half open, stuck to her sweaty skin, revealing her black lace bra.
It seems as if she was trying to hold up the wall behind her with her hands.
It seems as if she was having quite some fun.
Dr. Francis was too.
She was moaning. Looking at the handsome doctor dead in the eyes. Biting her lower lip.
His eyes were locked into hers. She lured them in, locked them in, and threw away the key.
He didn't know what it was exactly, but he couldn't stop looking at her. He couldn't stop admiring her beauty. Her long hair. Her emerald eyes. Her...

He was looking out the window for quite a while now. Not really looking at anything in particular. Just resting his eyes out there, in the concrete jungle.
He glanced down at his agenda, the one Claire had bought him only a few a months ago. The one with his initials inscribed into it, on the back cover, in small, classy, golden letters.
M.F.

He scribbled down some notes, and checked when his next patient would arrive.
He had some time before his next appointment, so he got up, walked to the sink, had a glass of fresh tap water, and sat back down at his desk. He moved mechanically, like a robot. As if someone had switched the autopilot lever inside his brain.

His thoughts wandered off again, while his eyes were fixed outside, in the frozen gray jungle. He didn't know which Blu-ray to play anymore. It's as if the memories were fighting each other, trying to defeat one other, and take the highest spot on the doctor's mental podium.

Last night, his mind was free. When he saw her, with her beautiful black dress, his only thought was: ""Damn, I'm a fucking idiot.""
He wasn't sad. He was just happy to finally see her. Even though she would probably never come back into his life. Even though he wanted her to bits. Even though she had probably moved on, found some rich guy or a random douche bag, he was happy.
She seemed happy. Or maybe it was because of all the make-up, covering up her underlying facial expressions. He didn't care too much.
He was simply mesmerized by her presence.

They said Hi to each other, had some small talk, you know, how are you? How have you been? How's your job? You got a promotion? Really? Wow that's amazing! Yeah I've been pretty good myself. Darren? Oh he's great... Are you gonna come pick him up on Friday? Okay, perfect. Just make sure he brushes his teeth. And does his homework. And doesn't eat cyanide. Or any type of poison. So yeah...

Mark paused the memory. He left it hanging there, in mid air.

A knock on the door.
""Come in"" said Mark, suddenly making himself look busy, quickly throwing the remote of the Blu-Ray player in the corner of the room.

""Hey, uhmmm"" said Melissa, holding a pen between her luscious lips.
""Your next patient is here, should I let her in?""
""Who is it? I'm sorry, I just looked at it but I can't remember."" answered Mark, raising his hands outwards, palms down, as if trying justify his momentary amnesia with that simple gesture.
""It's Mrs Sheerer."" said Melissa, cutely frowning at her boss.
Dr. Francis rubbed his hands and exclaimed ""Mrs. Sheerer! Of course! Well send her in.""

He looked at his wristwatch.
10:30.
""Jesus Christ"" he thought. ""Why does time have to go by so goddamn slowly?""
""Why hellooo Mrs Sheerer!"" shouted the doctor, ""How are we feeling today?!?""
A fragile little lady had walked into the room; she looked as if the wind could take her away, rise her up into the sky, and move her around like a crunchy brown leaf.
""Excuse me, Dr. Francis, I didn't quite catch what you said."" Humbly answered the shaky old lady. Her ears hadn't been working very well for the past 2 years.
""What I said was, HOW ARE WE FEELING TODAY?"" shouted the doctor, not mad, not irritated, but with the patience of an American suburb high school substitute.

""Oooh I'm okay my dear."" replied the golden girl, holding her dark red leather purse in her hands, scared a ghost would snatch it and vanish in thin air.

""My hearing device hasn't been working very well lately...""
""Could you give it a look please?"" shakily said Mrs Sheerer.
""Of coourse I can"" answered the doctor, extending his hand so that his ancient patient could hand him her audio-enhancing device.
""Let's see..."" he said, observing, analyzing, detecting any flaws in the small miraculous apparatus.

""So how are you my dear? How's Claire? Is she at home taking care of Darren?""

Dr. Francis kept his gaze on the device and said ""Claire isss uuhhh...""
A brief pause followed, disguised as distraction.
""She's fine. Darren's probably in school by now.""

""You know"" said the doctor, lifting his gaze up from the device, placing it out of the window, where it always found a comfy place to rest.
""Life is pretty strange sometimes.You share your life with a person, for years and years.
You share amazing experiences, you bond, you start relying on each other, needing each other. You live together. You do everything together. Or almost everything.
And then, something happens. Either you fuck up, or they fuck up. We're only human in the end right? But that one thing can shatter whatever you had built till that moment. Everything you lived for is gone. Finito. Caput. It's incredible isn't it?""

Dr. Francis paused for a moment, pondering on what had just spilled out of his mouth. Like a dirty vicious secret, which is meant to stay deep inside us, lingering beneath the surface.

""I mean sure, sometimes you keep in touch. You see each other every now and then, to catch up and what not. But sometimes you're just erased. For the other person, you don't really exist anymore. Not physically. Maybe mentally, as a distant memory. Waving at you, moving further and further away, while the volume of the sad melancholy music gradually rises.""

Mrs. Sheerer was fidgeting with her thumbs, looking at them like a wise ancient ape.
She looked up at the doctor and said: ""Sorry did you say something dear?""
Dr. Francis snapped back to reality once again. He had let the Special Features play. You know, the version of the movie with the audio commentary?
""NOTHING, MRS SHEERER, I WAS JUST THINKING OUT LOUD!"" shouted the doctor, cupping his hands around his mouth to make sure the old lady would hear him. Not sad, not irritated, quite happy actually. The Golden Girl's precious smile, her glazy eyes filled with cataracts, which had seen who knows how many things and bewitched who knows how many laddies; they bewitched the doctor as well. He couldn't be mad at the poor old lady for not having heard of word of his heart-breaking rant.

He handed the hearing device to her, waited for her to put it in its place and said with a smile: ""They should work perfectly now, Mrs Sheerer."" 

""Thank you darling."" replied the ancient patient.
""Oh and, the best of luck to you and Claire!"" she added, with a warm wrinkly smile.

The doctor chuckled like a teen hitting puberty and said: ""Yeah... Thanks.""

	The headmaster of the school Mr. Rogan worked at for less than a year had just fired him, and sat across from him signing verification documents. However, Mr. Rogan was uninterested.  He was much to focused on the kids out the window, the kids who loved him and whom he loved back. Soon he would depart from them forever. By then Mr. Rogan had already accepted the fact that he would be fired, and felt it was justifiable to someone who did not understand his ways. So instead of focusing on the inevitable, he focused on the kids.
	“You’ve caused nothing but trouble since your inception,” spoke the headmaster without taking his eyes off his documents. 
	For a moment he stared at the principal with his mouth half open. He glanced back at the kids one last time before saying “I can understand how you would think that.”
	The headmaster looked up at this, his eyebrows raised. “You taught the kids nothing, not counting teaching them to make outrageous claims, create blasphemous mischief and start countless shenanigans.”
	Mr. Rogan could not help but smile. The headmaster’s face became rigid. “Do you not see the common denominator of it all?” Mr. Rogan asked.
	The headmaster frowned at this.  “Things that cause kids to get into nothing but trouble?”
	Again Mr. Rogan grinned. “Oh headmaster,” he sighed, “I taught them to create.”

The awkward pause. You've handed me your band's demo. You tell me to pay close attention to the fourth track.


Who the hell do you think you are?
What do you expect me to do with a cassette tape?
*When will you listen to me?*
*Where can I escape this loneliness?*
Why does the ballad on every shit album show up in the same place?
How many girls have fallen for this?


""You don't remember me at all, do you?"" I remember he's a mediocre singer. I remember that he is part of a warm-up band that I am not here to see. I remember rolling my eyes throughout much of their performance. My mother used to tell me that if I kept rolling my eyes they would eventually get stuck in the back of my head. If only that could have happened twenty minutes ago.


I bite my tongue and it's the first thing I've felt all night.


*Discretion*.


He walks away and the dreadful exchange has concluded. This is part of his game. I've been given a riddle and the answer can be found in the fourth track.


It's months later and I've forgotten about this night.


*Repression*.


My jacket reeks of cigarette smoke and sweat. The noisome smell brings me back to the night this jacket was last worn, and my hand instinctively rediscovers the cassette tape buried deep within the side pocket. A sudden fear grips me, and I'm not sure why.


As luck would have it, I'm driving my father's old pick-up truck while my car is in the shop. The two knobs of the old cassette tape deck resemble eyes that tell me my next move.


I start the tape. The first three tracks are almost unbearable. The fourth track begins. A ballad.


One cliche after another. Dark. Creepy. It's about a girl. She has no idea she's being watched. My finger is reaching for eject. That is when he sings my name.


*Obsession*.

When we arrived at our destination the Leaders brought out twelve men. Each one of them had their face covered with a thick black cloth. The Leaders placed one of the men in front of each Messenger. The Leaders then came around and gave each of us a pistol; it was our present for passing all of the initiation tests. Mine was a small black revolver that was oddly heavy for its size.

After my fellow Messengers and I had received our guns, the Leaders began to give instructions. They told us where to shoot our victims, and they even specified the angle at which we should make the shot. I knew why they gave us these specific instructions; they wanted it to look like suicide. They think we are naive just because they raised us away from their society.

I looked at the man in front of me, the man I was about to kill, and something in my gut was telling me this wasn’t right. I've never had that feeling before a kill. Usually it felt right even when it shouldn't have. Why was this man having such an effect on me? I couldn’t even see his face. I held my gun parallel to the floor and placed it directly against the right side of his head, above his eye. I then tilted the gun slightly as per the instructions I had been given. Once it was my turn I took one last deep breath. I had my finger rested on the trigger but it felt like there was a hundred pounds of resistance stopping me from pulling it. What was happening, why was it so hard to kill this man? I took one last deep breath, and slowly squeezed the trigger until I heard a loud bang from the gun followed by a soft thud when the body hit the floor. Blood began to pool around the body and it began to circle my feet.

After a little while all of us had killed our target. The Leaders told us afterwards that if we wanted we could take the cloth away from our victims and see who we had killed. I was never interested in my victims before; it could have been an elderly woman or a child and it wouldn't have phased me. However, this was different because this was by far the hardest kill I've ever had to perform and I couldn't even see the man's face or the look of terror in his eyes. I needed to see his face; I needed to know why this kill was so hard. Slowly I approached the body, making my way through what felt like a sea of blood on the ground. I grabbed the cloth and began to take it off of the man's head. Looking into the man's eyes I quickly realized that they were my eyes; this man was me. I backed away suddenly and looked around and saw that all of my Fellow Messengers were having the same reaction as me. Also, I know we were all thinking the same thing: ""Who the hell are we?""",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_19lm1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/19lm1x/the_initiation/,

They never tell you how much of a pain puppies are. The shelter always says “This puppy will grow up to be nice and small.” They’re liars. “This puppy will be no trouble later in life.” Blatantly false. “This puppy won’t have to be walked when it’s wet and cold outside.” The biggest lie of them all. “The puppy won’t run away while you’re walking it.” Really? “You won’t have to spend hours trying to find that puppy after it runs away.” They can try better than that. “The puppy won’t end up covered in mud when you actually do find it.” Sigh. The people at the shelter are good at making you believe them. They don’t lie about everything though. Even after hours of searching, when I finally find that puppy, sopping wet and all covered in mud, I can’t help but smile and say, “There you are Bella, I was worried I lost you. Let’s get you home and cleaned up.”

God damn, it was cold. The breath curled from her lips and seemed to freeze midair. My wild imagination started to see the words she was saying forming in the clouds of steam as she rambled. She spoke eloquently enough, but tonight it had been a problem of quantity. Droning on and on incessantly about pasts, presents and futures and where my respective place stood in all of them. Clearly, tonight I was going to get left or laid. If only I could muster the attention to glean which was in store. My inability to focus, care or come back with any engaging banter of my own, as well as the ache in my right hip, told me it was clearly time for another dose.

""Excuse me. I hate to leave this hanging, you clearly have a lot on your mind, but do you know where a restroom is? I haven't been to this park often. You know I don't get out much."". She appeared crestfallen. Apparently I had interrupted her during her wind up to something pivotal. Nevertheless, she allowed me to excuse myself and directed me south, well slightly southwest or...it just occurred to me that I don't know my cardinal directions on the spot. How the hell do people do that? Anyway, she directed me to the bathroom. Shivering, I made my way to the bathroom to the soundtrack of my chattering teeth with an occasional ""Shit!"" stifled right before it left the lips lamenting my agony. I stepped inside and looked around to ensure that I was alone and not interrupting a meeting between two fellows who met on Craigslist only hours earlier seeking low key homoerotic pokey rear fun time. No one was there. I procured from my coat my trusty blue pill crusher, a straw, my scissors, and two gorgeous 30mg tablets of Roxicodone. Only the best on Fridays, because payday typically signifies the end of three to five days of unintentional cold turkey withdrawals. I cut my straw that I picked up from the diner earlier in the evening, having left all of my pre prepared models at home, and got to work. I cut the straw to around three and a half inches, creating a slightly tapered induction zone. I unscrewed the crusher and got to work powderizing the tablets.

A storm was coming, there was no doubt, the ache in the old bones couldnt be mistaken, and it was so silent and grey, as it always is right before the storm. He loved it. At his age he only had love for three things left – coffee, cigarettes and the beautiful silence before the storm, and now he had all of them at the same time, although doctor had forbidden at least two of them.
He was alone – the town was empty – there was no traffic, there was no sound. The new generation had left the town for bigger cities and the old one had died. There were no friends and no strangers, he was sitting all alone with his coffee and the endless silence.
A bright orange maple leaf floated above the road along his house. The old mans eyes wide open were looking at the leaf. It was something strange, in the surrounding grayness the bright leaf looked as if it had come from another world. The old mans heart filled with excitement and joy, feelings he last felt when playing chess with Oliver, about 7 years ago. He tried to think – where it might had come from? There were no maple trees in this town – at least none he could think of. Was it even the right season for maple leaves to turn orange?
He kept his eyes on the leaf that was floating gently down and then up again, depending on the breezes. He felt unexplainable peace every time it went up and then terrible fear every time it went down. As if leafs life would depend on staying in the air. OH NO! He gasped when the leaf floated only few inches above the ground, but then it got pushed upwards again. He couldnt think of any reasonable action he should do – should he try to catch the leaf? Or maybe let it float and hope itll never fall? The storm wasnt far anymore. You could feel it in the air.
It seemed that the leaf was heading up, above his house, when suddenly a wind came and blew it crashing into the ground. A silent gasp came from the mans lips and there was a sound of breaking glass. Thunder clapped and small raindrops started to fall on the ground.
An old man was lying on the porch of his house, a broken cup of coffee was next to him and a smoking cigarette butt in his hand. His heart was silent.

Who are these people around me?” I thought to myself when I first woke up. I slowly lifted myself up and rubbed my eyes thoroughly as if there was something in them, but nothing was. I looked over; a lady kindly greeted me and handed me a folder. As soon as the folder was within my possession I knew what must be done; it was pure instinct. I immediately opened it up and read all of the information. 
     I remembered that my name was Bob Lamron. I am 23 years old, have neither children nor a wife; they were only given to you if you had proven yourself faithful and intelligent enough. I asked the women who handed me the folder where I was and what events had occurred that left me in this situation. She just looked at me and smiled.
Two rather large males, who appeared to be body guards disguised as physicians, led me out the front door. As soon as I walked out, a car appeared out of nowhere. From the car came a robotic voice; it addressed me by name and commanded me to enter the automobile.          As I got in the car, the voice spoke again. It asked me what my home address was. I had no clue; I could not even remember if I had children 10 minutes ago. How was I supposed to answer the voice with details of my forget life? The women who had presented me with the folder, a nurse, that I had woken up next to, ran out of the building and handed me the same folder that I had left behind in the room. I opened it up and aloud, “2534 Egareva Rd.” As soon as the words had left my mouth, the taxi immediately sped off, presumably to the address.
As I saw the things I passed by I started to remember details, like I had never forgotten them at all. Trees, Birds, people, restaurants, fountains, everything! It was all flooding in as if there was a dam in my brain and it had just been ruptured without notice. We arrived at my house and I opened the front door. I walked into my room and sat down. I could not recall the events that had occurred before I woke up. It was like the dam of knowledge in my mind had been concealed. My mind had locked away any memories of the events and I could not do anything about it. The more I thought, the more my head hurt.
It felt like one of those moments when you are mid conversation with someone and another person, uninvolved in the conversation, calls your name. You stop talking in order to address the interjection of your name, but when you try to come back into the original conversation, you can’t remember what you were talking about no matter how hard you try. I sat there on my couch and tried as hard as I could to recall what had happened.
I then positioned myself so that I could see out of the window. I saw a grey, bleak world. Everything was so average, so normal. The only color people were given permission to wear were different shades of grey. The lighter your color, the higher up your social class was. I was just an average grey.
As I was thinking through all of this, my eyes were fixed upon a section of peeling paint in the right corner of my peripheral vision. For some reason I knew I was supposed to go over to it; it was like I had some kind of cosmic urge. My hand lifted from my side and I started to peel the paint. It came off fairly easily, far too easier than any paint should have, for that matter. Suddenly, I saw something concealed under the peeling paint. I knew I had to uncover it. As I tore the paint off a fit overcame me. Next thing I knew, I was tearing, ripping, and enjoying this more than anything I had enjoyed before. I was ripping everything in sight off the wall.
I stepped back and looked at my wall and there was writing everywhere. The memories started flooding back into my head of what had happened. I had uncovered something big. The government had been spiking everyone. Now they wouldn’t just bug a room, or a camera in a park to see what was going on, they were putting microphones in you. They had put chips in your brain so that they could see, think, hear, and smell everything you have ever come in contact with. Knowing I had just remembered this I knew they would be after me. I shut the blinds and closed the door in my room.
I lightly lifted a blind cover and looked out the window. I saw a slim, black, shiny car pulled up to the front of my building. The same two men who had accompanied me out of the hospital got out of the black car. I sat there shaking, wondering what I could do. The second I saw them barge in through the front door, I jumped out of my second story bedroom and landed on the pavement. My ankle buckled and I felt a sharp pain but I knew I had to get out of here and tell someone what is going on. I screamed names but no one would listen to me. I was living in a selfish world where people only cared about themselves. I gave up. I fell to the floor, my ankle throbbing, and looked at the door to my building, expecting the two men to walk through. I was doomed.
The two men eventually came out of my building and grabbed me. They didn’t say a word; all they would do is stare straight forward. Then they put me in the back of the car and drove off. It was the exact same route that led back to my house. I had only been out for an hour, at most and here I was, being dragged back. 
When I got there the female nurse was sitting there with a needle filled with what appeared to be a sedative. As she inserted it in my vein, two doctors walked into the room. The first said, “Okay, begin sedation and we’ll get ready for the micro-chip reset.”
The other doctor responded, “Looks like this one didn’t turn out to well again like the last time.”
	As they finished their sentences I realized something. They have been resetting everyone until they get every single one of us to be perfect for their society. They don’t want people to have character or personality; they are just looking to create the most generic human being, like emotionless robots. As I thought this, I started to black out.
“Where am I? Who are these people around me?” I thought to myself when I first woke up. I slowly lifted myself up and rubbed my eyes thoroughly as if there was something in them, but nothing was. I looked over; a lady kindly greeted me and handed me a folder.

If anyone had been watching him in his secluded corner, they would have noticed the slight tightening of his shoulders.  Otherwise, to all the world he was just a morose man staring into his drink with his right hand poised above an open journal as if waiting for dictation.  His statuesque pose opposite the drop of life that entered at that instant.

Watching her movements with his peripheral vision, the man admired the woman’s gracefulness as she danced between the tables and chairs.  She walked past his booth without a glance.  When the woman rounded the corner into the back section, he visually relaxed and let out a tired sigh.  Placing a ten dollar bill on the table, the man gathers his belongings as if to leave.

As he knelt down next to his backpack, the man stops and turns pale.  A chill runs down his spine as he glances over his shoulder.  Surprised emerald eyes stare at him from midst a heart shaped face.  The woman stands at the back corner with her hand braced on the wall, giving the look of a deer caught in headlights. They lock eyes and, for a moment, the universe stops its incessant ticking.  The man recovers first, standing up, brushing his coat, and while eyes still bound together, gestures to the opposite side of the booth.

Breaking eye contact first, she looks around the room in panic.  Seeing no avenue of escaping with dignity, the woman lets out an exasperated huff, the glides over to the secluded table. Motioning the waiter over she orders a Guinness for both her and the man.  They sat in familiar, nearly companionable, silence while they waited for their drinks.  When the beverages arrive, they both thanked the server then grew quiet again.  The Silence fully blossoms around them as they sit alone, together.

With a small smile, the man gazes at the woman.  He takes in her face, neck, shoulders, then follows her arms down to her fingertips. His touch had known every curve and angle. Closing his eyes, he takes a deep breath to both capture this fragment of time and shatter the growing silence.  Clearing her throat in indignation, she startles him back to the present. The man blushes, not used to being caught unawares. Silence, again, settles around them like a wool blanket on a mid-summer’s day.

The door crashes open, breaking their reveries. In strided a conglomerate of shrieking harpies announcing their intention to party the night away.  The woman looks relieved and glancing sheepishly at the man, gets up to go.  One of the birds disengages from the group, hurling herself into the woman’s arms, squealing above the sounds normally heard by the human ear. Not a glance is given the man as they go back to the herd.

Silence once again settles in the corner, bearing all its weight upon the man’s shoulders. He looks tired and beat up, almost lost. He only looks up once as he takes his writings out of his pack. Then he opens his journal and begins to write.

We couldn't have them talk about the relationship or how it ended and each of them have something they are holding back from the other person that we can't talk about as well.

The artificial lights in the train car reminded me of the halls of some unfamiliar hospital. The walls of the car were covered in a variety of outdated advertisements, public transportation maps, various warnings, and a list of procedures in case of some unforeseen emergency. Upon entering I had felt fortunate just to get a seat, but after a few stops there were just enough people remaining to limit me to an aisle seat, eliminating any chance of getting comfortable enough to sleep.

The assortment of people was as typically unusual as one would expect on the last train of the night. A couple sat across the aisle and one row in front of me. His hair was gray and clearly thinning at a rate that made him feel the need to grow it out some length and comb it back. He had a somewhat crooked grin as he looked at her and his eyes shown with the glint of a man who both knew he was getting away with something he shouldn’t be, but also felt no remorse as he was above the repercussions another might face.   Her hair was blonde beyond the years revealed in her face. Her cheeks drooped, but as she sat her eyes lit up like a child who’s just received their first cellphone. They talked like a high school couple on their third date, a few days before they decide they’ve found their one true love, focusing wholly on the other. In fact their mannerisms appeared almost unnatural, as if they were hiding something that no one was looking for.  Perhaps they both had families and dull lives waiting for them at home and were enjoying this last train ride where the people are new and the conversations exciting.  The longer I am aware of the two the more I feel as though the man is looking at me out of the corner of his eye anytime his attention can be drawn away from the obviously infatuated woman at his side. 

On the far side of the car a boy perhaps sixteen years old was washing paint off of his face. An early Halloween costume no doubt. It was likely he had come from the concert as had a number of others on the train. The remaining seats on the train were filled with unremarkable individuals much like myself. A slightly overweight, middle aged black woman dazes in and out of sleep with the jerking of the train, a boy nods his head with the iconic white headphones in, a man in a suit who presumably had a late night at the office stares at his phone to maintain the guise of never ending importance necessary today to maintain a respectable foothold in society. Two women speak the loudest, in an excited Spanish that seemed untouched by the late hour. They were in their late twenties with similar short dark haircuts which made it difficult to discern whether they were friends, lovers, or sisters. A man sits with the bike which will be his only accompaniment on his ride home from the station. Families sit huddled across rows, the kids have all managed to fall asleep, the mother leans against her husband and closes her eyes but cannot manage to drift off, the father stares out the window with a gaze that shows no signs of falling into sleep’s grasp. 

As I finished this glance around the train I noticed the woman that stood in front of me. I could not tell her age but determined she was old enough to understand the world but young enough to have her entire life before her. She was relatively tall, perhaps 5’8”, though my exhaustion at this point in my observations renders my estimations fairly useless. She wore loose fitting, high waist, light blue jeans, which were modest for her slim figure. Her coat too was rather vague as if purchased for the sole purpose of blending into a crowd. She had her brown hair up in the back in a small bun and allowed the back of her hair to fall and cover her neck much as her bangs fell across her forehead. Her pale face grew solemnly dark around her eyes which sat sunken back into the depths of her face. Her cheekbones sat high on her face and gave her a dignified look that contrasted with her reserved appearance. She too had headphones in and every few seconds she would inaudibly mouth a line or two from whatever it may have been she was listening too. Her expression revealed nothing. She was empty, cold, unfazed by her surroundings. This isn’t to say she appeared unfriendly or apathetic, simply untouched by the never ending stimuli of her surroundings. Her focus lies beyond the events of the train car, extending beyond the world to which my thoughts felt tied.

The look on her face captured my imagination as it was more inviting to the speculation of her thoughts than that of anyone else in memory. I was left powerless to grasp at the few clues available to me in order to invent the monologue in her head. Perhaps it was as simple as the melody and words to whatever song was passing between her ears and occasionally across her lips. She could be reminding herself of what mundane tasks she was condemned to the next day. Or perhaps it could have been that she wanted nothing more than for the torrential stream of emotional realizations to cease for a moment and allow her the peace of an uncomfortable train ride. Undeniably her face revealed the surface of a past perhaps not of a troubled individual, but of someone that has seen of the cruelties of the world and stares blankly, unforgivingly, into the faces of romantic ideals and the illusion of Gatsby’s dream. 

From her right nostril down to the top of her lip there was what appeared from my seat to be a trail of blood, or at least the dried remains of such a trail. It appeared as a stream cut from her otherwise cold face by a single drop of blood much as the ripples of a single pebble thrown into an otherwise calm body of water. The implications of the blood intrigued almost as much as her ability to ignore it. Not even the most subtle of subconscious motions seemed to indicate that she recognized it. She did not lick her lip where the blood met her mouth, did not reach to scratch at the dried blood, did not even noticeably move her mouth save for the occasional unspoken word. 

A part of my typically repressed conscience began to question whether or not I had some obligation to ask her if she was alright. Not just in this particular moment as she appeared for the time being to fall within the general standards of being well, but in her life. It is interesting the difference in meaning between asking someone if they are alright in contrast to asking someone how they are doing.  When we ask someone how they are we expect them to say they are doing well and to move on with their day or the conversation regardless of how they actually feel. To reveal more than this would be a burden upon the individual asking the question and their tightly budgeted time allowed to listen to your response.  I did not want to know that she was doing “fine, thanks” any more than I wanted to know that anyone else was “fine, thanks”. I wanted to know the story behind that blood stain and to know the pain behind the eyes.  I want to know the emotion behind the ceaseless blank stare. 

I felt helpless in knowing that I knew now as much as I would ever know about this woman. My mind began to drift from her for a moment to explore ideas of people I will never meet, stories I will never know, pain I will never understand, and emotions I have yet to realize. The train began to slow as it periodically did to allow for those lucky enough to be home to get off and she turned towards the doors. A bell rang over the speaker system as the door slid open and allowed her out into the West Oakland station, she walked past my window, and I never saw her again. The bell rang again and the doors slid closed. I look back from my window to where the woman was standing and an elderly man stood in her place. His expression revealed nothing.

Ray's fight or flight response was beginning to take control of his system as the dying star formerly known as Sol crept its way from sight. Why his designers put such a damned human response in him Ray would never know, not for lack of curiosity, but for the simple fact they were all dead. Murdered. By his hands.

His existence alone was proof that mankind had reached a level of intellect few had dreamed of - and even less had deemed possible before they destroyed themselves - As this whimsical thought brushed through Ray's organic based CPU his sympathetic nervous system triggered the adrenal gland to dump more epinephrine into his bloodstream - and Ray ran.

His rational thought processes diminished. His legs screamed for oxygen. His heart pounded. For the next twenty minutes Ray sprinted. Sprinted away from the source of his fear. Something incomprehensible. Something much more frightening than the armies he had faced before. Worse than even the largest artillery shelling he had ever been the target of. More fearsome than he himself was.

Though Ray was designed to be an unstoppable death monger for the 'radical' Cyo-Organics; Designed for nothing in the world to stop him or frighten him. Designed to crush all those who fought against the belief of integrating biology and machine.

""Hah. Religious wars.""

The concept eluded him as he thundered onwards.

""Damn humans.""

""ZAAAAAAAAP"" the sound of a thousand arcs of electricity suddenly came into being in his ears. The sound kicked his slowing Adrenal gland back into high gear as he was reminded why he was running. Them. The others. He had no name for them. Only fear of them and no time to contemplate what they wanted with him except perhaps his destruction. So he ran.

After he had completed his tasks of eliminating the opposing continents Ray had become...well...bored. He was an organic machine - designed for destruction. Armed with the highest tech available to the researchers. The EMP affixed to his back and powered by his core allowed him to easily subdue all attempts of defense in his conquest. The Gauss cannon embed in his arm's skeletal structure made short work of dispatching the then defenseless forces, and his nanotech skin created a armor capable of deflecting all attacks. Physical and electrical. He was even guarded against telekinesis - his designers had thought of it all. Except what to do with him when his mission was complete - The one hiccup that cost them all.

Suddenly Ray became aware of a sense of weightlessness as all of his senses snapped to this change in reality. He immediately attempted to run faster but was only treading air. His gaze shifted upwards to it. Them. The ones who put such fear into his body. Immediately he was racked with nerve-jarring shakes as this feeling of fear reached limits he had never dreamed of. He was being drawn into the gaping maw of their craft. An oblong affair so completely pitch black it seemed to not exist. However, it existed to Ray. As a fear so prevalent he could feel it. Taste it. So nightmarish in its quality his body rejected it and he vomited...

Lights. Bright lights. That was his first experience back in the waking world.

""What the he-"" suddenly he could not speak. His mouth worked. He was sure of his words. He knew how to put the two together. Nonetheless, he couldn't.

""We have been watching you.""

A thundering voice. A voice of immense power and knowledge. A voice to strike fear.

""We have seen what you have done.""

Where was it coming from?

""Worry not.""

Ray felt immediate relaxation course through his body. Palpable. Calming. It lifted him up and set him in a sea of peace as the waves gently rocked his anxiety away. He began to have a sensation of a presence. It was the owner of the voice. For some reason he no longer felt the blistering fear and anxiety of before. Only tranquility. The presence instilled a knowledge to him. A knowing of their relationship. They had been watching this third planet of Sol for eons. They had set it in motion. They had nudged here. Prodded there. Created the circumstances that had led to his creation. They had a name. They had a face. They were his father. His mother. His brothers. They had created all of humanity as an end to a goal. Ray himself.

""We have a job for you.""

As they flooded his mind with images and descriptions Ray, the ultimate creation of destruction, smiled. His face a reflection of the joy their proposition brought to him. He contemplated all the new blood to be shed.

""I'm looking forward to it.""

He wasn’t sure what day it was, but that didn’t matter anymore. None of it did. All that he cared about was that tree outside. It seemed so out of place. It was alone in the vast field that it stood in. He hadn’t been outside for days now, but even before then he’d never paid much attention to the tree that so captivated him now. He studied every detail of the tree that he could see from the distance he permitted himself. The pines of it were a standard evergreen color; the bark, brown and sturdy. There was nothing unusual about it. It wasn’t abnormally tall, nor was it a very impressive tree. It was the average Joe of trees. It was so unremarkably average, yet somehow it continued to enthrall his very being. He wanted to touch it, but was too at ease in his safe, comfy home. Besides, it was rather chilly outside, and almost dinnertime. Still, something pulled him closer to the tree that stood at a tauntingly 200 feet away. Why? Why did it call him so? Why him? Why couldn’t it just leave him be? He was content in his home; he wanted the solitude that he was granted in the past few days, but that damn tree…  He stayed there at his window, watching the wind travel through the pines of that average tree. He stood there watching, ignoring his growling stomach; ignoring his ringing phone. He stood there. He stood there… 
    
  As the night carried on, he noticed something moving towards the tree. What was it, an owl? Yes, yes, an owl. But why? Owls weren’t common on this side of town. The great white owl moved closer towards the tree. It didn’t seem cautious in the slightest bit. It gadded about the tree in a clumsy manner, then back stepped until the tree was in full view. At this point, the insolent owl took flight through the pines of the tree. It flew clumsily through the branches, knocking something off of it, and then continued through until it made its way out of the defensive tree’s grasp. The owl without so much as looking back continued its way through the night in a peculiar manner. The man continued watching the owl, growing angry for no particular reason. What gave that owl the right to fly through there in such an uncouth manner? It hit something as it flew through there! Aren’t owls supposed to be graceful in flight? It could have knocked a bird’s nest or something out! He contemplated going out there to check, but it was too dark, and far too cold to leave now. It’ll be fine; no point in checking now. It can wait until morning anyways.
     
  When the morning finally came, the man returned to his station at the window of his house. Maybe he should go check on whatever it was that fell out. But it’s so early, why bother? Can’t Mother Nature take care of it anyways? But still, maybe… He waited, waited; waited. He stared intensely at the ground surrounding the tree, searching for whatever it was, but to no avail. He grew worried. So many gruesome scenarios of poor defenseless birds ravaged his mind until he could take it no more. He back away from the window and returned to his room.

 The tree, the oh-so average tree just continued to stand alone in apathy. The wind moved on as usual; and the sky was the same shade of grey that it has been for days. Nothing had changed. Nothing.

  A door opened with a man tall man standing hesitantly in the     doorway. The man was bearing brown boots, jeans, and a thick, red,     plaid jacket. His face had been unshaved for days and his hair an excited flutter, but his eyes registered as those of a stoic. The man stood in there doorway staring at the taunting tree for a moment longer, then stepped forward. His movement was a clumsy traipse, but he continued onward. He was an awkward refrain, composed of lines; with anxious legs. His limbs were tangled like a streamer and he’d become an unclear, awkward dreamer, but he had a direction and stammered on for it. Once he finally reached the tree, he just watched it. He almost expected something to happen but the nothingness continued. After being lost in thought for a moment, he remembered the purpose of his journey and looked at his feet for what it was that had fallen the night before. He looked to the right of the tree and finally saw it. He leaned over to pick up the mysterious object that had caused such panic in his mind and once he had it in his grasp, he smiled and said to himself, “What an odd little pine cone.”

She watched them from her spot by the parkade, and listened to their gentle cooing, and wished that she could be so free, to spread wings and go where the wind would take her.

She had been living in the parkade for over a month now. The doves had followed her all the way from Cliff's Edge, her previous home. She had been forced to leave: winter was far colder by Cliff's Edge, and the snow tended to fall in great white sheets. Her journey had been long and arduous, and the doves had been there every step of the way. She welcomed their company, because it was the only company she had.

A small dove landed on her shoulder and cooed softly in her ear. It ruffled its feathers, then took to the air once again. They had grown accustomed to her, she knew. To them, she was just an oversized dove, wingless and beakless but a friend nonetheless. They never judged her or ridiculed her because of the way she looked, or talked, or lived. They just accepted.

She gazed up wistfully at the Buniard Building and noticed there were a few lights on in some of the apartments. Still early, then. Some of them were probably having supper now: families eating around the dinner table, or couples snuggled warmly infront of the television set, eating their T.V. dinners. The doves were her companions, her family. And the Buniard Building was her television set.

Through it she experienced the lives of its inhabitants. She learned to love some of them, and hate others, and often she caught herself rooting for one member of a family or another, and hoping things would come out right for them in the end. The day Mrs. Parkins suffered a heart attack she had been there, watching in horror, worried and angry at the injustices of life. Tonight Mr. Parkins was alone at home, pacing, clasping his hands tightly behind his back, moving like a caged animal - restless and lonely. Somehow she knew Mrs. Parkins had passed away. Perhaps it was the way he slouched, as though he had given up hope, or the way he had stopped brooding, as though there was nothing left to hope for.

She turned her gaze back to the doves, and saw them painted against a full moon. The moon was larger then she had ever seen it before, and took up a large portion of the night sky - a beacon among the tiny stars, and she was reminded of the story she had read in one of the papers, about a space shuttle that would soon be launched from Cape Canaveral and put the first man on the moon. How ridiculous it seemed, to spend so much money and effort to get to the moon, when there was so much suffering right here on Earth.

A chill wind started to blow. She heard its dismal howl, and watched as it overturned old carton boxes and sent newspapers skittering across the cold cement like mice. A plastic bag rolled down the road, hopping and creeping as though it possessed a life of its own. She started to shiver, and hugged herself tightly. She got up and brought a trash can from the parkade, filled it with the newspapers she had found that day - the Herald and the Boston Globe and the New York Times - and lit a small fire.

Startled by the sudden heat, the doves took to the air, and just when it seemed they would go up to the trees to roost for the night, they returned to her outstretched arms, and pecked at the bread crumbs she held in her hands.

As her gaze drew back to the Buniard Building, she had a strange premonition. Just as she had known that Mrs. Parkins was dead, she knew that something was going to happen tonight. The feeling was vague and far off, like a mirage in the desert, and she wondered if perhaps - and just like the mirage - it was a matter of wishful thinking. Did she want something to happen? Perhaps looking up at the Buniard was not enough, perhaps she longed for something more, something real. Something that would happen to her for a change.

Soon the feeling passed, leaving her cold and tired.

Young Vanessa Lewis was out by her bedroom window, gazing at the sky, and, in another apartment, Mr. Parkins was still pacing restlessly. Vanessa was a strange girl, but one of her favourite people to watch. She was forever arguing with her parents, like teenagers will, and sneaking off in the middle of the night. She spent long hours at her bedroom window, watching the doves, admiring their grace and beauty, not knowing that she herself was being watched.

Time passed, and soon even the sight of the pretty, wistful girl was not enough to keep her interest, and her gaze drifted, as it tended to do, back to the doves. They were acting strangely tonight, moving in short, abrupt movements, taking to the air and then returning, not remaining in one place for too long. Restless, she thought. Maybe they, too, felt that something was going to happen tonight. She would worry about that another time, though. It was getting late.

""Come,"" she whispered, ""we'll find a place to rest this tired body of mine.""

The pain in her back had returned with the cold, and she found it difficult to walk. She made her way to the park nearby, the Royal Grand park, a small sign stated, although it was far from royal and hardly what she would call grand. She made her bed in the lush, wet grass, and lay beneath the stars, and waited for sleep to take her. Around her the doves cooed and pawed at her clothing, perhaps looking for a last scrap of bread before they went up to roost.

But she felt restless, and sleep did not come quickly. She sat up and shivered slightly, and her eyes were drawn once again to the Buniard. Something was going to happen tonight. The realisation excited her. It was a warm feeling inside of her, as though a candle had been lit in her belly. Her eyes sparkled with a life she thought she had lost long ago.

And that's when she saw him, silhouette against the night, running. With a violent shudder the warm feeling was ripped from her, and in its place was only dread.

**Car crash from last night, as I remember it.**


     
Two thirty-two ounce Jeremiah Reds and we still looked sharper than a butcher's knife. It takes a real man to order a bottle of red, and even more so to take them as effortlessly as we did. It was quite a sight for the regular crowd. Three manly men enjoying their drink and catching up on some sports down at the, always welcoming, BJ's brew house.
     

As it turns out, and although it may seem like it, not everything always goes our way. The home team lost a crucial playoff game, beers were running low, and I hadn't been offered sex all night. This combination of unfortunate mishaps started giving me an odd feeling. I needed to shake off this funk, but I was out of smokes. My good friend Mauri sensed my discomfort, that or my childish fidgeting from craving a smoke. Whatever the case, it worked. He spotted a friendly, slanted eyed, sports fan that headed out for an opium break. Lucky for us he happened to smoke regular stuff as well. Our type of stuff. Some quick witted banter later and we were three cigarettes richer. We took care of the first two immediately.
     

Mauri put away our third friend for a later puff. Normally he'll do it with such elegance, I swoon. This time though, it strangely grazed his slightly large, but still handsome, earlobe. What normally wouldn't affect a frail or even a wet cigarette, this time destroyed our last piece of lung candy. Things were happening. Bad vibes were definitely out tonight. I decided at this point, it was up to me to keep bad shit from happening. I didn't mention any of these strange occurrences to Mauri or Mikey, I had to keep my composure. Lead by example and example the lead. It works.
     

It was getting late and it began to feel as if we had overstayed our welcome, that or this one fat headed bartender felt threatened. He offered free beer in exchange for our absence. I'm no cheap man whore, but no man in their right mind would turn down free beer. As a matter of fact no man in any state of mind would. No man.
     

We left to resume our night. The feelings that manifested at the bar had followed to the parking lot. Maybe it just wasn't my night, maybe I was being a pussy, maybe fuck you reader, but I didn't even put up a fight for the front seat.
     
""Shotgun!"" Mauri called enthusiastically.
     
I let out a quiet sigh, he rushed to the front. I'd usually sneak my way to passenger, tonight shotgun didn't appeal to me. I figured I should stop worrying and just enjoy my night. Mikey decided to play the classic sounds of our favorite trio, the Beastie Boys. With our last set of Reds in our hand and our heads boppin' he began to lay out the plan for the night.
     

""We're gonna head over to jack in the box to try that new jalapeno burger..."" He said with such anticipation, and reassurance I had never heard from him. He was leading by example.
     

Just when I was starting to feel right for the night, my gut instinct struck again. I was nice and buzzed but these goddamn spidey senses were tingling. Before I knew it, everything slowed down. My senses were amplified. I had a moment of clarity in my drunken stupor. I looked around to see if the guys felt this moment of divine lucidity, but all I could make out was Mikey going on with the plans and Mauri trying to rap to the B-boys. I closed my eyes. This was it. Whatever bad energy that was following us, it was here and it was about to blow. It was up to me to try to decipher where it was going to come from. I presses my eyelids shut. And I knew.
     

""Holy shit!"" Mauri yelled in the front.
     

I quickly fastened my seat belt and braced myself for impact. Some dumb bitch had made the roughest turn any of us had seen. Although alert Mikey reacted as fast as he cums, it wasn't fast enough for a clean escape. Mauri's glasses flew, Mikey's pride stung, and I had let them down. I should've said something. But men don't think in 'should'ves', we think for the moment and at that moment Mauri and I knew we had to dispose of any incriminating substance. We played the part.
     

""What the fuck?!"" Mauri exclaimed as he stepped out.
     
""Ahh mah shoulder!"" I played along.
     
""Are you guys ok?"" A worried voice shouted from the other car. We had them.
     

I quickly grabbed my bottle of Red and made my way to some stairway away from the crash. Mauri followed, Mikey worked on damage control. Mauri and I did what we do best and chugged those big Reds until their last drop. No man wastes a free beer and we example by lead. I was clearly drunk after this. We found our way back to the mess. Scolded the girl on her driving skills, but there's only so much you can do for a woman driver, and I was glad the bad vibes ended with something so trivial as a car crash. We waited, smoked, took tourist pictures of the sight and decided it was as good moment as any to call it a night.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_16gr2s,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/16gr2s/car_crash_from_last_night_as_i_remember_it/,

 When she fell she shattered a small flower pot, the soil and flower strewn beside her, brown and white spill that what would be considered as decor. 

*""Don't! Why are you doing this- It wasn't my intent!""* she wailed on the floor with a hand raised to the muzzle as if it would stop a bullet.

**Do it! She hates you, she wants you dead like the others; the men before her meant nothing, and neither do you!** A burly voiced cried in my head, a voice that was not of my own logic. It speaks to me in evil tongues and for a while I listened. I listened very well. 

**Kill her, you have all the bullets in the world, KILL HER**

I was going to do it.

**KILL HER! NOW**


indefinitely.

**KILL, FIRE THE BULLETS; NOW!**

I fried one shot. It screamed through the home before silence came down upon the household. With the one shot, someone had died, and only one person would leave when the police and paramedics showed up later that evening. 

In the house would lay one body. But with two souls.

I killed it. I promised myself I would kill it, and by God i knew I would do it. My wife thought I had gone insane, and told the police i felt guilty so i shot myself. No. I had the moment to end its life while it thought it controlled me. No, I'm the master. And now it is dead, silenced by me; silenced me.

Perhaps it thinks that it won the war, now that both of us are silenced forever.
But no. That will never be true. 

I love you Elise, thought it took me away. But always remember a time when it was me and you; just Me and Her.

The electronic display read zero. I looked at the display not believing what it claimed. I looked outside the dome. The red clouds blanketed the sky covering the sun and the desert soil. I looked back inside, wondering how people lived fifty years ago at the turn of the millennium.

The phone which hung on the wall started to ring. I had never heard it ring before so I stared subconsciously before I remembered that I had to answer it. I walked over to the handset. The light blinked as the receiver stopped ringing.
The door flung open and two cops burst through the door.

‘Mr Collins?’ I looked at the guard.

‘Who’s asking?’ I replied.

The guards walked over, hooked me in both arms and dragged me down the hall after slamming the door while muttering something into his radio. 

I looked the opposite way I was travelling as I skidded along. It was an odd sensation knowing that my life would end. The cold argon lights illuminated the room giving off a cold chill. I wondered who had invented them. The ability to turn heat into light whilst cooling the surrounding area had saved millions of lives, allowing a colony to keep cool without a power source.

We rounded several corners before we stopped. The guards dropped me to the ground and walked back the way I had come, closing two big doors behind them. I saw the gears and mechanisms on the door rotate and grind and I realised there was no way I was going back that way.

I stood up and brushed myself off. I had not collected a speck of dust because of the cleanliness of the corridor, but I still proceeded to nonetheless. I turned around to find a desk with a shorter man sitting in a black chair obviously too big for him.

‘Do you know why you’re here?’ He asked me.

‘Not really.’ I responded knowing full well why I was there.

‘Mr John Collins, born January 19th 2024, which makes you 32 as of 53 days ago, you were a model student, scoring an average score of a B+. We have no behavioural issues on record but a warning was issued in regards to a threat made to a colleague. You are an automotive service technician and you have no known offspring.’ He looked up and glared at me, waiting for a response.

‘Correct’ I responded.

‘On behalf of CiteRT, we are terminating your life on the grounds that you have expired your oxygen and water allowance without giving back to the community,’ I looked at his emotionless face. There was only the harsh truth of what lay beyond. ‘We are however offering you the opportunity to attempt to survive outside.’

I looked outside the window behind him. I looked off into the distance, beyond the cloudless, blue skies. Beyond the dirt mounds I could see nothing.

‘I accept.’ I don’t know why I did; it was just prolonging my agony. He stood up and handed me a backpack. 

‘I’m sorry.’ He said. ‘Good luck.’ I saw the glint of a tear forming in my eye. He ushered me towards an elevator where I went further down than I ever had before. The elevator pinged as the doors opened and thousands of years of global warming hit my face in one blast.

I fell to one knee and opened my backpack to find a bottle of water and a gun. I put the gun to my head, and heard a gunshot behind me.

The orange glow of the candles and torches flickered and faded. She noticed this. Eric, she called, as I descended into blackness. Eric, she warned, as footsteps approached. I could no longer heed her. I felt overwhelmingly intoxicated, unable to stand, unable to willfully coordinate useful movement. 

Her final call was half my name and half violence. Our pursuers had reached us, hushing her with a blow to the windpipe and dragging her away. As I drew in dusty, labored breath and began weeping, pleading with them, they attacked me as well. My ribs, neck and head received a flurry of strikes and a sharp shock to the back told me I had been stabbed. A new taste graced my tongue and spilled to the floor. I sputtered and my breathing seized.

The candle's glow sharpened with a new scream. The last offering from the poor girl. It echoed off cold walls, in my head, my wound, and invaded my blood. Our assailants had left their dagger in me. I painfully stretched and writhed, grasping the blade and freeing it from between my ribs. It was ancient, inscribed with a language unknown to myself on a shining, yet darker than gunmetal blade.

I attempted to stand. Control was coming back, but rising without leaning into the walls would have been impossible. I held the blade tightly and resolved to follow her last cry down the corridor. I shuffled weakly forward, feeling the grit and blood combine with fearful sweat on the dagger's handle. I stumbled through darkness and wondered how far in the ground we - I - was. I couldn't even hear the subways rumble past anymore. The bustle of the thriving city above was mute, seemingly as terrified as I was in the dark. I descended more steps, expecting the flames of hell to greet my soles. 

She was forcibly laid on an altar. They did not attempt to bind her. They simply held her, in the interest of time, and completed their sacrament. A pyre's flames began to consume what remained and unleashed an awful stench to go with the ghastly sight. The followers awaited my arrival and tended the flame.

I couldn't pay her any mind. They watched as I staggered into the light. They were not surprised. I was expected. The only words offered were, ""It is done,"" barely audible over the roar of the flame. They offered no fight. It seemed as if they had offered themselves as sacrifices in return for the girl. There was no resistance as the blade I now held sunk deep into their hearts. 

I worked quickly, invigorated by this new feeling, the pleasure of murderous revenge. Yet, as they lay writhing on the floor, choking on their final breaths, I felt unsatisfied. And then, panicked. 
What had I done? I hadn't known these people, and I hadn't known why they had brought the girl and I down there. I hadn't even known the girl whom I took revenge for. But she had known me, somehow. Fearing repercussion, I felt the need to cover my tracks. The crackling fire, blazing high to the ceiling, offered me a solution. I slowly, laboriously dragged each corpse, and some, soon-to-be corpses, toward the fire, singeing myself as I pushed them into the heat.

In my excitement I forgot about my wound. Something, adrenaline, perhaps? Something covered the pain, despite the massive rush of blood seeping out. With my shirt I attempted to stop it and turned to face the stairs. I began the long journey skyward, accompanied by my footsteps and new memories only.

After what seemed to be hours, I arrived where we began our captive decent. I pushed hard on the metal grate overhead, noticing I had finally stopped leaking blood. Maybe I had run out, I weakly joked to myself. The grate swung open, crashing hard. The sound of the city greeted my ears again, and artificial light, fluorescent, neon, lit the alleyway like daylight. I struggled to lift and close the grate with another slam. I began walking quickly, paranoid for witnesses. I still bore the blade thoughtlessly. 

""You look dead,"" commented a homeless man, crumpled against the wall, arms protecting his drink. I could hardly speak, and became more worried, looking for more viewers. I limped to my apartment as fast as my legs would allow.

I felt like I had conquered easier mountains. The last bit of stairs leading to my apartment tested me more than anything else that day. Several times I collapsed weakly, desiring nothing but rest. Luckily, the common areas of my building were vacant. I wondered how late it at night it had become, how long our ordeal lasted. I shuffled the last few steps to the door, unlocked it, entered and slammed it shut quickly, locking every available lock. I crawled through the kitchen, to the bathroom, leaning on the sink. I turned it on, drinking messily from a cupped hand, before searching for gauze. Too tired to care, I stuffed it in any wound I could muster, and burned the last of my energy crawling to the bed. I slammed face down on my pillow and closed my eyes, instantly asleep.

I found no relief from the terror of yesterday in my unconscious. Events played and replayed, reliving the attack, the pain of the stab, the fear as the girl was dragged away forever. I felt once again the warm fire, the cold stares of my victims. They seemed to stare at me even in death, and beyond the flames' consumption. I saw myself again, from a different point of view, as I stumbled wildly from the alley to my apartment, more ragged and animalistic than I remembered. Like a madman, I saw myself entering the apartment, drinking, bandaging myself, and crashing into my bed. I saw myself lay there for what seemed like hours, even recognizing the light of the sun begin to creep into the windows. I see myself become startled as the sunlight revealed a viewer, seated neatly on an old folding chair. 
I ""inspect"" closely.

There is a pulse to everything in life; a steady rhythm that resonates through this world, setting a pace for the mad race to nowhere we all seem to be competing in. Whether it is the catchy beat of a song stuck in our head as we bike to class, the violent rumbling of a towering thunderstorm, or the pounding heartbeats of two lovers beating in unison at the start of a sleepless night, every moment in life has a distinct cadence that seems at times to be the only thing pushing time forward. It can inspire euphoria or strike fear in our hearts, but with no regard for anyone else it presents itself and begs for our attention.

It was the chaotic ringing of my alarm clock and subsequent pounding in my head that woke me up this morning. Like a bat out of hell the shrieking of that damned machine cut through the peaceful realm of my dream, dragging me into reality from some beautiful fantasy forever lost to the deep crevices of my subconscious.  Sometimes I feel as though the hardest thing in life is dragging my ass out of bed after a long night. My dorm room is small and my roommate is either miraculously still sleeping or trying to salvage his own fantasy from the rude awakening of my alarm clock as I fumble to turn the damn thing off. Contrary to what most people believe, there is no such thing as silence. In the absence of my alarm, silence does not settle on us but rather the subtle vibrations of a hundred other students quietly preparing for the morning class we never should have signed up for. The scraping of my toothbrush, the hum of the AC kicking in, the roar of water rushing out of the shower head to meet me head on; one noise leading to another to compose the jumbled melody that echoes through the dorm hall and out into the crowded streets where it joins a symphony of cars, bikes, morning joggers, and disgruntled youth on their way to class. 

Soon I was a part of that symphony, playing my own part as I crawled to class. I put my headphones in to drown out the cacophony around me with something a little more familiar. I pressed the shuffle button and the song reminds me of a girl. My heart beat speeds up and joins the music as a wave of emotions rolls over me. Just as the different sounds of my morning routine had given way to one another so did my emotions. Joy at first, that she was coming in town to see me. Then doubt, that she would still feel the same as she did when we last spoke. Fear, that I wasn’t good enough. Anger, that I had once done wrong by her, putting me in such a delicate and unsure situation. Hope, that maybe we were still recoverable. It had been almost two years since I messed up, and here she was driving 6 hours just to see me. 

The fluctuations of my emotions settled into a steady drone of uncertainty as I crossed the street. The blaring of a car horn interrupts my favorite part of the song and I flick off the driver who was apparently so inconvenienced by a 5mph decrease in speed that he needed to let the whole block know. Asshole. 

The sun is warm on my back but a cool breeze pushing against me sends shivers down my spine. The thud of each footstep sends unwanted vibrations through my sore legs, and a stronger gust of wind presses against me. I imagine that with a mind of its own the wind was begging me to turn around. “Sorry,” I think, “my math professor probably won’t accept “the wind told me not to come” as an excuse for missing the quiz today.” I hate this class. While it may be easy, it’s also all the way across campus and at 9 in the morning. 

I miss summer with no responsibilities: when I could stay up late and look for trouble without a care in the world. We got in a big fight this summer; me and the girl did. It had been the first time we had spoken in over a year, and we were both drunk. She told me I didn’t deserve her. The worst part was that she was right. We didn’t talk again for a long while after that. Then out of the blue, about 2 months ago, she texted me. Somehow the conversation never ended. We talked everyday, and while it was strange at first, we slowly evolved, or perhaps regressed, to a level of comfort neither of us had known for years. It was great. Is great.

Nine impressive booms brought me back to the present as the clock towers time reverberated across campus. I picked up my own pace knowing I hade 10 minutes to get there, my footsteps matching the beat of Mr. Kanye West’s music. I almost tripped stepping off the curb to cross the final street, my math building directly ahead. Embarrassed I glare at the chubby kid passing on my right who had let out a short laugh at my expense. Another car horn from my left requests a vulgar reply but my world is spinning before I have the chance to accommodate it. 

All I see is the blue sky; it really is a nice day. Something hurts, but I don’t know what. My head feels wet, and somebody is kneeling over me yelling something. I want to ask her to talk slower but my voice escapes me. 

I remember six years ago when I first met her, the girl that is. A teacher kicked me out of my reading class because I would finish my work too fast and pester the other kids. I was placed into an advanced program for students who “though outside the box” as they said. I didn’t really care at the time, I wasn’t the most popular kid and another class just meant another group of assholes who wanted to prove they were better than me. This class was no exception. Some guy spent most of class pretending to yawn as he flexed for the whole class, and girls just loved it. But she was in there. She liked him, but that was to be expected. He was confident and athletic, me: not really either. 

I hear a siren coming, and I want to tell them that it really is unnecessary; I’m fine. 

It’s Valentines Day and I’m anxiously sitting in second period. I had bought her flowers the day before. Two roses to be delivered sometime this period. I can hardly contain myself. My best friend runs into my class laughing hysterically. He says I spelt her name wrong on the card, first and last. I can’t believe it. I’m so embarrassed. That familiar racing of my heart, the loud anxious beating that seems to have been ever present in my youth, sends blood rushing to my cheeks. 

Somebody is pressing on my chest, and blowing into my mouth. I think about asking the paramedic if he plans on buying me dinner after, but that would probably be awkward. The tempo of his hands weighing into my chest reminds me of my own heartbeat, which strangely is suddenly so much quieter. 

It’s been a month since I butchered my Valentines Day plans, and I pass the girl and her new boyfriend walking down the hall. I decide to take the long way to class from now on, and I’m swallowed by a sea of noisy students performing a piece unique to the depravity of middle school. 

The paramedic’s head is eclipsing the sun behind him, and I realize for the first time this morning just how cold it is. I feel the cool breeze flowing over me. Sandwiched between the cold ground and the paramedic, I remember the gust of wind that had asked me to turn back. I wish I had listened. 

It’s 3 years ago. I’m a sophomore and a little more mature than the awkward preteen who barely survived middle school. Through some bad experiences with girls I’d become a little jaded. The disappearance of the ignorant nice guy persona ironically gave way to a more confident attitude that some described as me being, well, an asshole. I walked through the door of my Spanish class and my eyes immediately fell on her. The girl, who sat right next to me, was dating some other kid in the class, but that didn’t stop me from trying to occupy all her attention right in front of him. She was temporarily out of reach, but I was making an impression. As the teacher’s instructions began to fill the room with the unfamiliar tone of a foreign language, I glance over at her, she at me, and I wink. 

The paramedic stops performing CPR. His tireless effort seems to have finally found success. But the sad expression on his face and the stillness of my chest forces me to realize the alternative. 

It’s October 10, 2009, a little over two years ago. Or maybe it’s the 11th, I’ve been drinking and time loses meaning on nights like these. I pull my shirt over my head, my pants long gone. The girl pulls me on top of her, and we kiss. Four long years brought me to her, and there is nothing in my world except the pounding of her heart against my chest, the rhythm of our tongues, and the room spinning around me. But before we could proceed a thundering knock interrupts our perfect moment. Somebody calls up that my dad is drunk and at the front door.
 
I realize that this might not end the way I’d hoped. Everything seems distant, surreal. I want to look around me but I cant. I want to get up and run back to my dorm but I cant. I’m stuck on the ground surrounded by the pulsating whaling of police sirens that for once in my life is comforting. 

It’s December 28, 2009, and I’m carrying flowers towards her front door. It’s her birthday, and I hear the gentle hum of Christmas music from the other side of the door. She answers the door in a bra and Santa skirt, her perfect body greeting me in a fashion I could never have fantasized. She leads me up the stairs as our footsteps echo through the empty house, and I am truly happy. 

The ever-present pulse that prods life along doesn’t miss a beat, and I can feel it leaving me. All the beautiful sounds of the city are slowing down, and the cries of people around me have all but faded away, but I can’t be mad that the rhythm is leaving me. It has a job to do and I wouldn’t deny the rest of the earth its soothing presence. 

It’s April 12, 2010, a year and a half ago. She is crying. I’m crying. Were standing in the parking lot at sprouts. I’m begging for a second chance, and she doesn’t know what to do. She can’t trust me she says. She doesn’t understand why or how I could do this to her. I don’t either. She drives away, and I’m left standing in the punishing cold, unwilling to admit this is real. I close my wet eyes, and the roar of the wind envelopes my senses. 

I feel like I’m sinking into myself. A darkness on all sides begins to encroach on my vision, and a silence settles on me for the first time. There is no pain, except regret. The girl. I wont be able to see the girl tonight.

The MC just finished summarizing the operation,
calling it ""The most successful infantry op of the 21st century""
 
     I'm the only man in the ballroom not wearing the Army Service Uniform.
It's a small gathering, just a platoon, a small platoon of thrity men or so.
The only reason why I was here is because of my job. I'm the MI liason for
the CIA, providing key information to SF and Infantry units. I provided the
information on this op, and I know now that I'll live to forget it.
 
      There was a silence, then a young corporal stood up and spoke.
 
""To Lieutenant Morton! For his leadership got the job done, and kept us alive!
To John!""
 
The audience followed suit. ""To John!""
 
I raised my glass half-heartedly, knowing that I have ruined that man's life forever.
The festivities began, and I stood up. I walked towards the officer's table. He was
surrounded by his family, and the family of his late Platoon Sergeant. It's been almost fifteen
years since I've seen John. He was my best friend through Junior high and high school years.
I haven't spoken with him since we left for college.
 
I got medically declined  my third year of ROTC in college. He was commissioned top of his
class at West Point, class of 2019.  So I got a job at the CIA, serving and working as close
to the army as I could, working as a mission spook. In a way, we were doing the same job,
except I made two hundred thousand dollars a year versus his fifty-three.
 
I tapped his shoulder.
 
""John? John Morton?"" I asked in confirmation of his name.
 
""Yes"" He replied.
 
John didn't look like he was in his twenties at all. He had a long, jagged scar across his face,
and mutliple pale patches of skin on his right hand, making the skin grafts noticable. His left
hand, there was no left hand. A metal plastic prosthetic replaced his missing flesh.
 
""Who are you?""  He asked, looking at my face intently, like I looked familiar.
 
""I'm Matthew Magee, the spook."" Smiling afterwards.
 
John excused himself from the table and walked with me to an empty table.
 
""Matt! Damn! It's been years since we've talked. What's going on?""
 
The man who had once been my best friend in school at been shot at, blasted at,
and gave his right hand for his country, yet he was still lively and friendly as he
was in school. My eyes watered as we talked about our lives. The family, the army life,
spook life, and eventually the mission that we had just taken part of.  There was a
brief pause in the conversation. He then spoke.
 
""Thanks for the info you gave us. You got most of us out of there alive--""
 
A tear rolled down my eye.
He stopped talking and asked me what was wrong.
I pointed to his prosthetic. I blinked back my tears and cleared my throat.
""John, the mines...."" I paused. ""I knew about them. I tried to tell your Platoon
Sergeant, but I was cut off by radio security procedures. Then the mines went off.""
 
He put his left hand on my shoulder. He and shared tears that only combat veterans
can share. Serving the country, the guilt of alternative service.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_159fz9,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/159fz9/the_guilt_of_alternative_service/,

He had a good wife, a good son who took care of him, a good job, and a good house. Jack was a happy man. He wore sharp suits, gold watches, silk ties. Jack was a happy man. He hosted parties and everyone came. He never forgot anyone’s name. He had six Mustangs in his garage that he never drove, and two that he did. Jack was a happy man. He got along with his in-laws, his parents visited him often. Jack was a happy man.


One day Jack went to a train station. He didn’t have a ticket, but he wanted to go to the train station. He walked to the train station and saw many people he knew on the way to the train station. The people smiled and waved at Jack, and Jack smiled and waved at them. Jack was a happy man. When Jack got to the train station, he had to wait for a little bit, because someone he knew was waiting for a train. Jack knew most people. Jack was a happy man.

Jack said he’d consider it. Jack was a happy man.


Jack’s friend boarded the train that pulled in at the station. Jack’s friend waved good bye. Jack waved good bye. Jack knew the conductor, and they waved to each other. The train left the station. Jack was a happy man. Jack took off his hat and coat. He looked around and saw a homeless man. Jack gave the homeless man his hat and coat, and, as an afterthought, his wallet as well. There were four hundred dollar bills and three fifty dollar bills in that wallet. Jack was a happy man. Jack looked down the tunnel, and he saw his train approaching. Jack was a happy man. The train was almost to the station when Jack stepped directly in front of it. At his funeral, Jack’s family was confused. Jack had never had a problem in his life, everything was easy for Jack.

The whole nation was already full of unhappy people, a generation that had been fed the lie that if they worked hard they would eventually be prosperous and happy, were unemployed or held dead-end jobs where they were constrained, bored, underpaid and unappreciated.  They were furious at being mislead.  A generation of baby-boomers before them had stolen all of the prosperity from the nation and left a dying planet behind as their inheritance.  

The nation’s news-media grew increasingly cynical, morbid and depressing every day.  Networks were purely out to make money and the dying nation, which felt helpless to help itself, ate up these stories and wallowed in its unhappiness.  As a result those with mental disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, psychopathy and narcissistic personality disorder, began to believe that they were in fact part of the majority, as people had forgotten long ago that TV was not a true representation of reality.  Such individuals became so convinced of their normalcy that they never sought out the mental counseling they so desperately needed, and as their self-assurance grew so did their boldness.  

A few started openly killing innocents, and once made famous by the greed of the media, more joined in.  Soon even innocent children were not safe from the crossfire.  With every disaster that befell the nation its people, scared and delusional, gave up one civil liberty after another until the freedom the nation once held proudly over the heads of the rest of the world was nothing more than a distant memory.  Its citizens grew divided between the five stages of grief; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance as though each stage were in fact an ideology to live by.  

Only a small percentage of the population had made it to the final stage and the deniers were so desperate to believe that everything would be OK that they turned their back completely on science and reason, the two things that human beings prided themselves on the most.  The desperate actively ignored the evidence that came to light more and more every day, and lashed out at those who sought to end their ignorance.  These people controlled vital aspects of the government, and so the nation was locked in a terrible stand still, completely unable to deal with the current problems and imminent dangers of the future.  

Only one solution seemed to remain; revolution.  A total revision of government and civilization.  But revolution was never to happen, too much of the nation had become convinced that they were completely helpless to influence the world, and reverted to total depression, complete apathy or a mix of the two.  Each time an uprising started it was never able to gain enough momentum to stop the government from quelling it, through military and police action, and more powerfully through clever manipulation of the press and propaganda.  People came to fear conflict more than anything, especially amongst themselves and so they created societal restrictions on which words they could say and which situations they could show in movies and on TV. In this stifling environment people became unable to think for themselves, and creativity and originality were snuffed out.  Suicides, murders and sickness grew.  

Some began openly hoping for the end of their world.  Nature began lashing out in its death throes as the misery of money continued to strangle it.  Floods, droughts, blizzards, and terrible storms wreaked havoc across the planet.  Wars over resources broke out around the globe, and finally the government took total control of the nation through military and police supervision.  Each and every citizen was now a ward of the state, but even with strict laws in place limiting the production of more children the population had already grown too large to sustain.  Soon governments around the world began to consider something once thought to be unthinkable-nuclear war.  

All it took was one missile, and all pandemonium broke out. No one can remember who made the first move, but it hardly mattered once a nuclear winter, an event which scientists had been warning about for decades, consumed the planet.  The access to food and water, already scarce, became virtually non-existent and the starving population bottlenecked.  The humans, plants and animals that managed to survive were plagued with genetic mutations and disease.  Extinctions on a massive scale ravaged the land and sea.  Eventually only a small niche of organic life remained, breeding and evolving over many thousands of years to create a new era.  Although some mutated form of the human genome survived, the human race is never again at the top of the food chain.  

All information that humans had gathered and analyzed over the centuries was lost forever, for you see, the human race had been so distracted by war and money that they had never mastered space travel.  When the sun eventually went supernova, any existence of life on the planet Earth and possibly in the entire known universe was completely eliminated.  Doomed to revert to the stardust which had originally allowed for its creation.

The landscape outside was one of sadness and desolation, desert scrub and dirt covered in wreckage of various machines, smoke obscuring the skyline. The horizon was a deep orange, nearly red, intermingled with a glow like gold illuminated by halogen. He looked out the door way into the garage, sparing a look for the outside before quickly ducking back inside in case of prying eyes scanning the landscape for refugees and supplies.

 Turning around he walked down the hallway. The inside of the house was dark; electricity having stopped flowing weeks ago, the only light they had left was the sun and the moon. When the smoke cleared. Peering into the rooms as he passed, they no longer held much other than furniture and trash. Old mattresses and non-working televisions, various odds and ends lay strewn about. Anything of worth had been stripped down or discarded long ago. He stopped at the end of the hallway, there he found his brothers body, he knew he would find it there. Sparing one last glance at his younger brother, not a child but far from a man still. He closed the door quietly behind him and continued down the hallway into the common room.


He glanced out into the back yard, it was quiet. But that made it worse. Even through the smoke and debris and dust in the air, it was calm and still, not peaceful, but still like death. He picked up a small satellite phone he had left on the floor amongst other things, blankets and small canisters, batteries and small cans of food. There were two pistols on top of a large metal case. It was filled with ammunition of a smaller caliber. Large weapons were hard to come by so he made due with what he could find. He dialed a number into the phones keypad and waited silently, wondering how long it would take for the worlds communications to fall. They worked on batteries, but how long the satellites would last was anyone’s guess. He considered the fact that someone must be maintaining them, perhaps a remnant of the government, he knew not.
""Hello?"" A voice said on the other end, ""I’m ready to go,"" He replied. ""Did he make it?"" The voice asked, sounding somewhat hopeful, ""No he didn’t, but we need to move now so please come quick."" The voice on the other end never replied, just clicked back at him as the user hung up. He sat down, methodically fitting bullets into eight magazines, four to fill each firearm. As he completed the final magazine, a man opened the front door and quickly slipped inside. ""Is this all?"" He asked, gesturing to the supplies he had gathered. Without answering he rose from the ground, handing one pistol to the man and beginning to gather the various objects. He stuffed them into large ruck sacks; he had found them in the back of a truck a ways down the road the night before. They finished filling the bags and moved outside, throwing them into the backseat of a small pickup truck, they pulled out of the driveway. Neither would ever return.

Cold.  Freezing.
	

Jacob was cold.  White snow fell around him and on him.  The snow on the ground next to him was stained a scarlet red.  Jacob’s head turned, painfully, side to side as he gazed at his surroundings.
	

The sun was setting, its last golden beams vainly trying to penetrate the ever darkening trees.  No one was in sight.  Jacob was too weak to call out loudly for his missing comrades.
	
His comrades?
	
Where were they?  A thousand thoughts flashed through his mind as he struggled to remember what had happened.  He looked down at his stomach, which was a painful reminder that jolted him back to the present.  His abdomen was slashed open and he was missing large chunks of flesh.  Somehow, all major arteries had remained un-severed, so he had a little more time to live.  
	
Suddenly, the gory smell became overwhelming and Jacob felt bile rising in his throat.  He turned his head sharply to the left and vomited out the contents of his stomach, which was mainly bloody stomach acid.
	
Pain flashed through his stomach as he wiped his mouth on his shirt sleeve.  The nasty taste in his mouth receded a bit.  Jacob tried to move away from the vomit, but only succeeded in moving a foot or so.
	
Memories of a dark shadow flitted through his mind.  Then it all came back to him in a flood of memories.

“Hey, Parham, c’mere!” Corporal Walton shouted.
	
Jacob turned, the edges of his lips and eyes crinkling in a small grin.  

“That’s Sergeant First Class Parham to you,” he replied jokingly as he sauntered over.  
	
“Here, have a cigarette,” the corporal offered.
	
Jacob declined and sat down on a small stool.  About ten similar stools formed a ring around a small crackling fire.  Jacob counted two seats open and two faces missing.  Those two had just left on patrol.  The remaining men were to wait in base camp until they got back.  Then two more would take their places.  The men were due back in thirty minutes.  The two that had just returned from patrol were chatting with the others about what they had found in the woods of Germany.
	
“I swear it was a footprint!  A huge one, too!” one of them was protesting as the other men laughed and patted him on the back.  “There’s something out there!”
	
He turned around to face the sergeant and Jacob realized that it was Kirby.  Kirby was a green private, fresh from boot camp and completely new to the war.  Jacob figured he was probably just overreacting.
	
“Listen here Private,” Jacob said calmly “It’s okay buddy.  It was probably just a bear out there.  It wouldn’t come near our camp, they don’t like the noise.  No worries.”
	
“B-but,” Kirby stuttered, “Bears don’t live in Germany…  Right?”
	
Walton chuckled and shook his head a little.  “Don’t worry about it,” he said as he handed Kirby a cigarette.  Kirby was not really paying attention, but somehow managed to slip it into his mouth as he fumbled in his pockets for a lighter.  Jacob sighed and slipped out his own lighter, but, to his dismay, found it empty and returned it to his pocket.  He felt in his other pocket, but the only thing in it was a grenade.  Just in case.
	
Kirby’s patrol buddy, Sergeant Phillip Wooden was busy showing off a “treasure” that he claimed to have found on the patrol.
	
“So we’re hiking through the woods, right?” he said to the others in his New York accent, “And we come across dis place dat could have been a German camp about a year ago.  An’ dere are scattered remains of things all over the place.  A few empty shells here, a button over dere, and maybe a boot half buried in the ground, see?”  He turned to find Jacob staring at him, eyebrows raised.
	
“Oh, don’t worry about it Sarge, the place’s cleared out, I made sure.  Dey couldn’t have been living dere recently, dere were no signs of recent activity!”  He turned back to continue his story.
	
“So me an’ Kirby here were scoutin’ around, lookin’ for anything worth something an’ we find dis guy, strike dat, dis skeleton juss’ layin’ on the ground.  Flesh all gone, been eaten off by rats and insects, I s’pose.”
	
At this point, Kirby put his hands over his ears, seemingly desperate to avoid reliving the grotesque discovery.

“He was wearin’ a tattered German uniform and his skull was a bit cracked on the top,” said Wooden, not paying attention to the private.   “We figgered he had been hit on the head with somethin’ hard.  I found dis helmet on the ground a few feet away.”
	
To prove his point, Wooden held up a German helmet.  It was a dull shade of green with a faded black swastika on one side.  The straps hung loosely from the sides, ripped and frayed, and there was also the usual dirt smears and smudges.  Wooden grinned and slipped the helmet into his bag while Jacob pretended not to notice.
	
“Hey!” Walton yelled, “What was that Wooden?”
	
“Nothing,” Wooden grinned.  “Ooh look, cigarettes” he said as he tossed a pack to Walton.  “Next time, just ask.”
	
“Thanks buddy, you’re a pal,” Walton replied as he slipped a deathstick between his lips and lit up.
	
The time went by as the men told jokes, laughed, and played cards.  All of the heads popped up when the two returning men emerged from the woods, guns propped against their shoulders and grins on their faces.  The others rose with shouts of greetings, except for Walton, who was groaning sarcastically about having to go on the next patrol.  Everyone felt great.  And then, something happened.
	
A dark shadow flashed out from the woods and both men were knocked to the ground.  One was tugged screaming out of sight within seconds.  The other men scrambled for their weapons and the poor fellows screaming suddenly stopped.  Everyone was still and quiet for a second as though a hushed silence had just descended upon them.  
Jacob broke this spell by running towards the woods, his rifle loaded and trigger finger itching for action.  The squad spread out through the woods, scanning every inch they could.
	
Somewhere in the woods, a man screamed.  Jacob grimaced.  The scream had belonged to Walton.  He moved frantically in the direction of the scream.  He could hear only the crunch of the leaves beneath his feet and the snapping of the twigs.  Then he saw it.
	
It was a standard M-1 rifle.  That was not the problem.  The problem was the still twitching hand holding on to the rifle.  There was a class ring on one of the fingers.  Class of 1939.  Walton’s.  Jacob gulped and turned around as another scream sounded.  Jacob froze.  He looked all around, scanning the trees around him.  Five minutes later, the woods were silent.
	
Jacob’s palms were sweaty on the gun.  He licked his chapped lips and took off in the direction of the last scream.  He had to find his soldiers.  He just had to!  He followed the trail of snapped branches, trampled undergrowth, and crushed leaves, all dotted with drops of bright red blood.
	
A bird twittered in a branch above Jacob’s head and he flinched.  A small animal darted through the woods past Jacob and he involuntarily squeezed off a few shots at the poor animal.  The squirrel fell dead in its tracks.  Jacob passed right by it, not even paying attention.  His right eye twitched a bit and his finger became jumpy and shaky on the trigger.
	
A branch broke and Jacob turned in the direction of the sound.  His gun pointed at a silhouette in the darkening forest.  “W-Walton?” he stuttered, “Who’s there?  Show yourself!”
	
As the thing moved closer, Jacob’s gun barrel became very shaky and he was hardly able to keep a grip on it.  A few rays of light landed on its face.
	
It.  A hairy beast.  Seven or eight feet tall.  Jacob gasped nervously, eying the ram’s horns growing out of the beast’s head and its glowing red eyes.  It was chewing on something and a muffled crunch issued from within its mouth.  The matted fur below the mouth and its chest were stained bright red.  But Jacob’s eyes had focused on something else.
	
A torn piece of camouflage material hung from the creature’s mouth.  Jacob’s mind snapped and he screamed like a homicidal maniac, which, in fact, he was.  Jacob’s finger clenched around the trigger and the gun barrel began spewing bullets right and left.  A few shots hit home, but they didn’t seem to faze the creature.
	
Click.  Click click click.  No more ammo.  A large hairy fist slammed into Jacob’s stomach and he collided with a tree.  He coughed up blood and the bittersweet taste returned him to his senses.  Painfully, he stood up and began to run.  His mind was completely blank.  He relied on instinct.  And right now, instinct told him to run like hell.  So he did.  Adrenaline surged through his veins and Jacob felt the pain recede.  But he didn’t care.  Nothing really mattered anymore.
	
The thing was in hot pursuit.  Somehow, Jacob managed to stay ahead.  A clearing soon appeared and Jacob’s heart skipped a beat.  He was running straight towards a flowing river, ten feet across.  Jacob gulped, but he kept on running.  Time seemed to slow down.  Ten feet to the river.  Five feet.  Two feet.  Inches.  “Jump.” Jacob’s mind told him.
	
Jacob jumped.  He launched himself over the river.  Little minnows and bigger fish alike darted around in the water beneath him.  It was very deep.  Jacob’s feet hit the ground on the edge of the other side of the river and he leaned forward into a roll.  Dizzy, Jacob stood and ran a few more feet before turning to look behind himself.  The monster had paused at the edge of the water.
	
“Aha ha ha ha!” Jacob laughed.  The beast glared malevolently at him and Jacob suddenly wished he had remained silent.
	
The beast put its foot in the water and did the same with the other.  It took a step and the water went up to its hairy waist.  Another step and the waters were up to its shoulders.  The thing wasn’t even halfway across when its head disappeared beneath the calmly moving water.  
	
Jacob knelt and began to pray as he had never prayed before.  “Let it have drowned.  Please, please let it have drowned…” The surface of the water was still smooth.  “Oh God, please let it have drowned, please God!”  Jacob’s voice had become shrill.
	
A head poked through the surface of the water, causing small ripples.  Jacob’s jaw dropped and his heart skipped a few beats.  He slowly got to his feet as the monstrosity emerged from the river, water dripping from the shaggy wet fur.  It looked and him and growled a deep guttural growl.  Jacob yelped and stumbled onto his backside.  He began pushing himself back in a desperate attempt to escape this horrid fate.
	
But Fate had different plans and the monster lunged at him, seeming to grin.


**PRESENT TIME**

	
Jacob coughed up blood again.  The cough wracked his entire frame.  He heard heavy steps growing closer.  Jacob fumbled at the chain around his neck.  His numb fingers were unable to undo the clasp.  Growing desperate, he yanked and the chain snapped.  He held it up and opened the small locket, ignoring the dog tags that fell to the ground.  Inside the locket was a picture of himself, his wife, and his son.  

Tears glistened around his eyes as he fought the urge to cry.  A sob escaped and he heard the footsteps grow closer.  He kissed the locket and slipped it into his pocket.  Death was knocking at his door.
	
But Jacob was now ready to welcome Death.  He found himself grinning for some reason.  There was a little lump in his pocket.  His fingers closed around the small metal cylinder.  From out of his pocket, Jacob pulled a grenade.  He giggled.
	
“Hey you big creep!” he shouted, half moaning.  “Come and get me!  I’m right here you big lump!”	
	
Jacob heard the deep growl behind him and cocked his head towards it.  He was struggling to sit up when a powerful grasp closed around his waist.  The already stabbing pain in his mangled chest intensified.  Jacob shut his eyes and resisted the urge to scream.  He pulled the pin on the grenade and extended it close to the monster’s terrible face.  Jacob’s eyes opened.
	
“Go to hell,” he said calmly.
	
The grenade exploded.

It might seem weird and stuff that I'm writing you a letter. There's just something I need to tell you.

Anyway, do you know what lucid dreams are? They're when you're dreaming and you realize you're dreaming, and then you can control it because it's all in your head. Anyway, that happened to me last night. I forget what happened at first, but I realized I was dreaming, and then I remembered about lucid dreams and stuff. And then you were standing there. I grabbed your hand and suddenly we were flying through the sky. Then we were falling (but just for fun, I didn't let us hit the ground or anything). Then we were soaring through the ocean past fish and stuff, but we could still breathe. Then we went to outer space to see the stars close-up, and we could breathe there, too. After that, we were suddenly just in a room together, sitting in two chairs and talking for hours and hours. I don't remember what we talked about. I guess it wasn't important.

Anyway, that's it. I don't know why I felt like I had to tell you that. Sorry if you're weirded out or whatever.

I never knew you, but we are connected. I waited for you. I chose you. It could have been someone else. Just five more seconds and you would have passed, but you came around the building and I knew. It was the itch. The itch that’s deep inside. I’m sure you’ve had it yourself. The kind of itch you can never dig out. Trust me I tried. The first time I got the itch it felt like my stomach was being eaten from the inside out. So I took my knife and dug into my own flesh. But the deeper I went I realized I couldn’t reach it. When they found me with the black hole in my stomach, they thought you did it to me. They told me I was a lucky bastard and said I’d have a chance to get even with you soon enough. They told me I would live. So they patched me up and gave me pills, but I knew the itch would never go away. Now it calls me, guides me. It guided me to you.

Please don’t think I’m a monster. I’m sure you would have done the same, wouldn’t you? I didn’t order you to show up when you did. I just do what I’m told, by the itch, and the itch chose you.
	
I let ten of you pass from one wall to the other. I watched as the first of you leaned around the corner. I could have sworn you saw me, but you didn’t. The first of you leaned around the corner and gave a hand signal and you all came pouring out like ants from a hole. So if you’re looking for someone to blame, blame the signal man, not me. He gave you that red star on your chest just as much as me. 
	
The red star. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to get a red star. I used to think about it all the time, but after a while I realized making it this far meant I never would. I still think about it, sometimes. 
	
As I was saying, you came around the corner, and as soon as I saw you, I got the itch. What’s that? Why? Speak up, man! Why did I get the itch? If you have to ask that question, clearly I was wrong and you never had it. In short, I don’t know. I know that isn’t the answer you want to hear, but it’s the truth. I don’t know why the itch chose you. You look like a decent enough fellow. I didn't hate you when you came around the corner. Actually, I get the sense that we are similar. 

But you came around the corner, and I didn’t feel much of anything, just that small seed of fear. Surely, if you don’t know what the itch is, you have to know the fear. Even now, with the red star on your chest, I still fear you. I know, it sounds stupid, but I do. Because I could be you. Because we’re connected you and I. Someday, someone might get the itch, and it will be me that gets a red star. But this time, you came around the corner, and I waited. 

I know you want that red star to mean something. You hope that in some small way, that badge on your chest will make a difference, and you know what? I think it does. Maybe not in the final outcome, but inside, yes, I think it does because you can claim it as your own. You earned it. But not just for yourself. If this whole thing was only for ourselves, we wouldn’t be here, am I right? But we are connected, I know that much, and that’s how I know it means something. 

Well, I better get going. Say, what’s that? That in your hand? May I? Oh wow, what a great picture. She, wow, she is really beautiful. And look at those kiddos. Hey their Chief you have a helluva good looking-oh, Jesus. Man, I’m sorry. Here, keep them in a safe place. 

Take them.
Common take them! 

Alright, look, I’ll just tuck them right in your pocket there. Man, don’t look at me like that. I told you it wasn’t my fault. Weren’t you listening to a single word I was saying? We’re connected. I waited just to be sure! The itch told me! Stop staring at me you sick bastard! I swear I’ll put another red star right in your damn forehead! Stop staring at me!

*Pop!* 
It’s not my fault!
*Pop! Pop! Pop!*

The dead soldier’s face was unrecognizable by the time they stopped Private Anderson. The stock of his rifle was implanted in the side of the enemy soldier’s skull, but even without that final blow, Anderson managed to fire off a full clip into the man’s face and chest.  

As recalled by Lieutenant Jeffries, Private Anderson was being restrained by three other soldiers when he arrived on the scene. The private’s face had gone pallid in the struggle, his lips blue and twisted into a hideous form. And he was screaming. Jeffries had heard plenty of screams in war, but nothing so primal, so pure. It was like Anderson spewed a patchwork quilt of sorrow, horror, and darkness over the men, and when it settled it found every nerve in their bodies and plucked it like a guitar string. Watching him lose it, they all felt cold. Because they knew it could be them, that they were connected. They could be drug away with spittle flying from their mouths screaming, “the itch!” Just like Anderson.

It was calm, and quiet. Nothing but the sound of the fan cooling me from the opposite end of the room. The fan was soothing for some reason. Like a glass of warm milk after a nightmare. It calmed me, and the cool breeze from its blades made it easier to sleep. I had a long day ahead of me tomorrow. The last day of school was finally in my grasp, and I was more excited than ever for summer. I had fallen asleep almost instantly. 
     I usually never dreamt but tonight was different. I found the dream to take me to an airplane cockpit. There was a pilot and a man in a jumpsuit standing next to it. ""Ready to jump?"" the man shouted as he opened the plane door. A gust of wind flooded into the cockpit. ""Remember, pull the blue chord, then the red chord!"" he shouted at me. I nodded with an understanding of what to do. ""Ready, JUMP!"" the man shouted as he leaped out of the plane. I hesitated looking at the long drop below me. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes; I jumped. 
       The wind pounded against my face as if someone had placed a jet engine in front of me. It stung my skin as it pounded against my mouth, nose, and eyes. It was horrific and terrifying. 
     The man was no where to be seen. I panicked and decided to pull my parachute. I pulled the blue chord; nothing. I pulled the red chord; nothing. My parachute hadn't deployed. I began to freak out; my parachuted hadn't deployed and I was falling at around a hundred miles per hour towards solid ground. I was going to die. I frantically began looking over my jumpsuit for something that could possibly break my fall and save my life. A backup parachute perhaps. I remembered in lots of movies that the one who's parachute didn't deploy always had a backup parachute. I scoured my jumpsuit for something of such nature. I spotted a small handle with the inscription ""emergency"" on it. This had to be it. I frantically pulled it and a small parachute burst put of my suit. I was saved for the moment, but my trouble was not over. The chords that connected me to the parachute began to snap and break off. The parachute quickly disattached itself from my suit and flew away. I was falling again, and I was going to die for real this time. I looked down; the ground drew closer and closer by the second. I closed my eyes and prayed. When I opened them the ground was unimaginably close. Then everything went dark. 
     ""Wake up, you can't fall asleep on your last day of school,"" a voice said. I looked up to see Mr. Manson; my math teacher. I was in math class, drooling on my desk; oblivious to the world around me. I was at school; I was safe. I breathed a sigh of relief and sat up. It was time to learn and not sleep. 
     The school intercom sounded; ""Lockdown, I repeat this is not a drill, lockdown now!"" Mr. Manson rushed everyone to get under their desks while he went under his. ""Open up!"" a strange voice shouted from outside the door. No one moved a muscle. The door then burst open with a cloud of smoke and fire. My ears were ringing so loud I could not hear anything. The man was shooting a machine gun into the room. I threw myself onto the ground in an attempt to save my life. The firing stopped as did the ringing in my ears. The man left the room. Cautiously I creeped from off the floor and looked around. ""Hello?"" I said with caution. There was no answer. I had stepped out of one nightmare and into another. 
     Usually in a dream one could have control of the actions around them as if they were like a god, but this was no dream, this was a nightmare, and in nightmares, you're powerless. You can't even control your breathing. In this nightmare that man with the gun was the god of my subconscious. He decided who I was and what I did until he decided when the nightmare should be over. I had to find a way out. 
     I frantically looked around the room for something to defend myself with. A pair of scissors or a small knife. I scoured the room. When I looked in the teacher's desk I found a gem: A 9mm pistol. I grabbed the pistol and looked outside the classroom door. The coast was clear. I ran for the next room; pistol ready. 
     Everyone in the next few rooms were dead. Was I the only one left? Was I going to die here? Is the world like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" where if you die in your dreams you die for real? I prayed it wasn't. I continued down the stairs. 
     Down the stairs was the man. He had just shot the janitor and a student. I had never met either of them, but my pity for them grew. I raised my gun to shoot the man. I cocked the gun. I began to sweat uncontrollably. I was about to kill another human being. I was about to take another person's life. I had to, it would set me free from this awful nightmare forever. I turned the safety off and pulled the trigger. 'Click;' nothing had happened. I began to panic. What if the man had heard the click? Was he going to turn around and shoot me instead? I prayed that was not the answer; it was. The man snapped around and pulled the trigger. 
     I jolted awake covered in sweat and panting from the terrible nightmare. It was still dark in my room. I could only hear and feel the cold breeze from the fan on the opposite end of the room. I glanced at the clock which read one-thirty in the morning. I had five and a half hours until I had to go to school. Sleep alluded me for the time. I had just plugged in my headphones and watched the sun rise. Today was the last day of school, and I prayed the dream hadn't come true. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_139w2p,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/139w2p/nightmare_first_real_story_advice_appreciated/,

His grip tightened, his eyes narrowed.

A young boy stood still in a forest. Pools of sunlight slowly grew and retracted with a light breeze. Timelessness and faint understanding of place and existence crept in. Echoes of birds birthed a sting of emotion, tightly winding primal joy to this beautiful understanding of everything. How I never wanted to leave, for this place was not a part of the world that I was. My thoughts and convictions simply evaporated here. For the briefest of moments, I was truly free. 

A young man sat in a field. No roads were near, nothing to break his purpose. Tall grass, dotted with golden buttercups, purple wildflowers, and patches of goldenrod gently swayed. Warm sunlight eased his strain. Vividly green trees enclosed this paradise. Scents melded together, creating a delicate aroma. Everything was so alive, so detached. His world struggled to understand this concept. The young man embraced it as something more. Wisps of high cirrus clouds raced across the depth of the blue sky. Here, he felt himself become a child again. He shed his worldly concerns, closed his eyes, and indulged himself. I never wanted anything else but for this.

A middle aged man sat on a small strip of sand, cradled from view by thick bushes. The skies changed hues, progressively darkening with each shift. All was still. His boat drifted forward gradually, leaving no ripples behind it. Stars and planets rose into view, reflected so perfectly that one might genuinely not be able to determine the difference between horizons. Auroras painted themselves across the sky. Fierce reds clashed with persistent greens, sending bickering splashes off in all directions. I knew all I would ever need to know. 


He snapped back into his world, almost as if forcefully ejected here randomly. His emotions and senses dulled, aware they were no longer in a perfect place. Here, purpose was sent helter skelter by pressure to succeed at trivial and pointless things. How burdened they are, he thought to himself. How strange I must seem to them now. How silly they will feel once they are me. His grip loosened, and his vision blurred. 

A photograph drifted slowly to the floor.

You know the word hurts her.  In your mind’s eye, you see how its barbed indifference breaks through the receiver, pierces her eardrum, and drills its way into her veins.  You must have known how she would answer.

“That’s good.”

There’s a long silence.  Perhaps her words had the same effect on you, but she hopes not.  She doesn’t want everything to end like this, it’s just... there’s nothing left for her to say.

The silence stretches further.  You can tell that she’s waiting for you to apologise and make everything right again, but you won’t, and nothing can ever be right again.  Everything is ending.

The silence is harsh now, stretched so taut that even the smallest murmur could shatter it like frosted glass, breaking it into a thousand polished razors.  You therefore pick the lesser of two evils and silence her with your thumb, pressing down on the picture of the red phone with a firm click.  That was your last chance to speak together before they shut off all communication and close the doors, but at this moment you don’t want to care.

Why couldn’t you have just gone with her, survived with her, loved her?  She loved you.  You said that you didn’t want to live out your days in a metal house, that you wanted to die someplace where you could still see a new dawn or a new face.  She didn’t understand you; if the end is the same, then surely an extended night is better than a brief dawn?  She never could understand how you felt, how you nobly embraced your death, content with the life you had led, whilst she hid in the ground like a coward.

She still remembers when the two of you first met.  It was her first summer in England since she fled from her homeland.  She lived for a while as an outsider, a struggling refugee in a strange, alien land, and had just begun to settle in when she spilled a cup of coffee on you at the station.  You exchanged bouts of apologies and self-blame until they were gradually replaced with dull platitudes and became conversation, and you asked her to join you for a drink.

You took her to what you said was the best coffee shop in all of London; it was a standard coffee chain – Starbucks, if she remembers correctly – but you said that it was in just the right position, that when dawn broke and the sky turned golden, the light would rush and weave its way along the cobbled alley, and its wealds would engulf the shop in warmth and make it shine.  She only understood about half of the words you used, but it seemed to make her feel safe for a time.  You didn’t seem like most English men, not chasing after the latest car or piece of Apple merchandise, but thoughtful, considerate.  You were intelligent, referencing Plutarch, Socrates, and even the Bible – although you held no faith yourself – whenever you saw the slightest opportunity, and devoted to making something of your life, but still unsure of what to make of it.

The two of you had discussed the idea of someone pressing that infamous red button back then as a thought exercise, the idea had seemed ridiculous.  Even still, your decision was unanimous; neither of you wanted to live in a metal house, you’d both rather die someplace where you could see a new dawn.  She was still affected by her experience of war in her homeland, and was determined that nothing would make her flee her new home, that she’d rather die than live in a cage – even one of her own choosing.  That was four years ago; you were both young and foolish, filled with noble, quixotic ideas of romance and freedom.

“Everything ends eventually,” you said; that was your reasoning.  “Best embrace that ending someplace where you can still smell the breeze.”  It sounded so sincere, so meaningful that she was completely taken with your sudden existentialism.  You quoted Asimov.  “Even the stars run out, you know.”

It was reassuring for her to know that the world in which she had suffered so much would come to an end someday, but things change over four years.  People grow up, don’t they?

It was on the day that the war that had engulfed her home finally came to an end – one or two years ago, you couldn’t quite remember which – that things began to change.  To her, the world no longer seemed to just bring suffering, for it had brought her a new home, a new chance at life, and you; to you, the world’s progress – being entirely unrelated to your own – was insignificant, and the world’s ignorance of your talent served only to confirm your perception of yourself as a chained and muzzled muse, yearning to break free and soar above the philistine mob.

Over time, she became closer to you, her affection increasing along with her skill for English, and you seemed to feel for her, although you weren’t quite sure.  Maybe you would have loved her someday, but the current events distracted you; with tensions mounting over Syria and Iran, suddenly the idea of someone pushing the red button didn’t seem quite so ridiculous anymore.  It scared you.

The government announced the bunker system a month ago, although they’d obviously been working on it for some time; they knew it would be needed eventually.  You’d been with her that day, but she had been acting strangely; she was clearly expecting something, and you thought you knew what.  She wanted a piece of metal for herself, a band of metal and a rock to wrap around her finger and to chain your inner artist once and for all.  How selfish.  You didn’t think you were ready for that commitment.  It scared you.
So you focused yourself upon your art, that was all that was important, or so you told yourself.  This was how you were going to endure, how you were going to cheat that familiar stranger, Death.  You needed no philosopher’s stone or alchemist’s piss, through your art you would become immortal, infinite.  But the nagging feeling at the back of your mind warned that you would fail, that you would die unnoticed and unable to repent.  It scared you.

There was warning before the missiles were going to hit, about thirty-six hours between when the satellites registered the launch and when they were expected to impact the city.  You took her to the coffee shop to discuss what the two of you would do with your last precious hours of life, but she surprised you; she was going underground, to the bunkers, and she needed you to join her.  Your throat turned to ice.  Hadn’t you already told her that you didn’t want to live your life with her in a metal house?  Hadn’t she said that she didn’t want to die in a cage, wasn’t the dawn important to her?

She said that it was about immortality, humanity needed to endure.  All the beauty that people had wrought needed to survive this ultimate show of humanity’s true nature; why couldn’t you see that?  She’d found so much to live for in this new world, and she hadn’t fled her own land just to die in a new one.  She loves you, that was the point, but what was the point in love if it isn’t eternal?

You wouldn’t listen to her entreaties, for she had betrayed you.  The tethers were tightening on the muse inside, the ball and chain restricting its movement.  You were losing your chance for immortality, and it must be her fault.  You didn’t know, but by this point you had built your own metal prison.  You have trapped yourself inside a cocoon of solipsistic iron and you can’t find a way out.  You are lost in a maze and the hollow walls are razors that tear and split your skin, and all that lies at the centre is a hangman’s noose.

But it’s not your fault is it?  It’s hers!  You call her witch and a whore, how dare she!  In turn, she calls you selfish, but her words have no bite, she thinks she’s lying.

So it’s over.  You tell her never to call you again, that she should enjoy her thirty pieces of silver while she can.  She picks up her coat and gently asks you what you’ll do with your last remaining hours.
“Wait,” you say, and then you divert your gaze to the coffee-stained table; you are done.  She walks out the door and joins the shuffling crowds moving slowly towards the bunker entrance.  She’s gone.

So you wait; the shop is deserted now, and eventually dusk falls.  The shadows slither and clamber along the cobbled alleyway, their tendrils slowly swallowing the building, sucking all warmth from the shop until it seems entirely forsaken, empty.

There’s a small vibration in your pocket; you pull out your phone and answer the call.  She asks you how you are.

“Well,” you say.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_12jcbg,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/12jcbg/metal_houses_a_piece_i_wrote_for_a_competition/,

The handles on the backs of the seats kind of suck up the comfort. You first see her sitting three rows ahead, in the opposite aisle. Her type is rare here, especially alone.  Blonde, slender, frail and quite. You would like very much to speak with her. Nothing creepy, but it's been a while since you've talked with someone who wasn't a crack head or strung out or family. Touching, that's far out of the question.

A rest stop comes soon. Very scenic, McDonald's parking lot, highway crossroads. Brown tinted gold in all directions. Drone sounds, and slight hills. Just the kind of nowhere place you've become accustomed to; you and your little red bag, with everything you need, freshly restocked with ketchup and sugar packets, honey and whatnot. Bits of crayon, business cards, scraps of paper, emergency candy bars and a notebook. This notebook, which you have in your hand, and fill with all you can pass through. Maybe somebody shall see, but it's unlikely. You also draw, scratch out scenes, nothing of great importance, except maybe to you. They unlock something that usually lives under heavy key.

And that girl is out and about, alone. Conversation is out of the question, but a piece is saved on your tiny page. A simple composition: parking barriers in their concrete dotted-line merge with car hood, boxy and blue, pulled forward to the limit, while a pale green branch twists a lonely way up, as the girl stands underneath, unencumbered, turned slightly away, admiring the wild grass hills with reverence most often reserved for Fuji, or the Louvre.  And as like, you see her composition.

Seeing surprisingly few cars and hearing even less, though they're there. Just because something is there you don't see or hear it, just ask pedestrian casualties. You find the scene has shifted, with hunching lines wrapped around, keeping warmth close to home. Fellow passengers begin to exit, some with big white bags, leopard print grease spots, many with large plastic cups. Each handful equal to a week of change that you yourself give for food. You find first-world self-imposed hunger to be quite a joy, at times. Henry David said it best you think, not sure what it is.

""Some View."" You speak in horrid tones. Her words make no impression, but just because there is no record doesn't erase the facts. The beach is a favorite. Her sounds are not made by those on this shore, and she's come a long way by dubious means to be in this concrete stamp. There are past friends in the future.

It takes quite a lot of radiation to bring you along. Mass and gravity. Once it's begun; inevitable. You drop your pack in a square room, with table and chair, couch and tv, broken mirror and the beginning of christmas lights, her old classmates and exchange program vets, introduction and pot. And a couch, maybe more. You have no problem taking what's given, and road kill is godsend.

Your mind reels. Potent stuff, and a night of bonding complete. No rejection; absorption. Standing on concrete, you watch lights play out over the hills. Squadrons, paramilitary air support looking back through sights; it's possible. This view interests those new friends of yours, wavelengths mesh, and you begin to believe in yourself, how you've found it: belongings.

You sit in a room with them all, not all, but many. Remaining in one place, more or less, with powers and responsibilities of a low but noticeable magnitude. Tenuous roots embed, expand. A schedule of sorts, time meaning something besides departure. Love?

And you are surrounded, suspended on nothing, no base, no lid, wide open, a part of the scene, and you are engulfed. Flesh-body-soul enter those around you, the choice bits going to the blonde who brought you in, and nothing remains but contentedness.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_12g3s5,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/12g3s5/the_traveler/,

A slight tremor to his his chest and an almost beaten cadence, a solitary procession where he bared the roles of the mournful. A keen observer, a much more practiced observer, might have recognized those steps, that striking appearance, that leathery coat worn smooth with age. Trodding forward treading his own shadow dreading that feeling of familiarity, nostalgia aged and fermented in oak barrels, no one took him for anything out of the ordinary. He was more or less ignored.

The site held some historic value. Until recently it had become somewhat decrepit, a derelict spot where teenagers would sneak off to and tempt the spirits of a bygone time. The village council recognized the importance of keeping up appearances and the head of that council claimed it as their collective heritage. A simple sign ‘here among others lie the founders of Cobham’ propped up with two wooden posts.

As the man drew past the gate he eyed a familiar plot belonging to a ‘Catsy Whitehouse, 1920-1947 beloved daughter’.

*Are you really happy?*
 

The advertisement’s subtitles scrolled across the screen in time with the voice, Demetri could imagine a little ball bouncing across them in time with the speaker. His voice was like warm velvet, full of all the intonations and expression to imbue it with a feeling of altruistic concern, as if it were some great fatherly deity looking down upon its children and asking them if they were all right, did they want anything from the store? Was school going okay for them?

It was a question Demetri could imagine coming from a doctor too, the voice wasn’t simply prone to philosophical musings, no this was a question about a symptom.

Are you hot?

Are you cold?
Where does it hurt?

Can you feel this?

*Are you really happy?*

The symptom was unhappiness, not merely limited to true melancholic depression, nor the more colloquial ‘blues,’ no, the advertisement called out to everyone who simply wasn’t happy all of the time.

The advertisement called out to the entirety of the human race.

Unhappiness was a symptom of the sickness that was the human condition, and Elysia was the cure. Elysia,a serum that was cheap, efficient, and ultimately accessible by all. It cornered a market that had existed for eternity, a market that in itself contained all others; vacations, travelling, dining out, film, entertainment, all of them fell in comparison. If the generally accepted goal of life was to be happy, and one could be happy simply by buying, and charging, an eRing™, eBracelet™, or for the truly opulent, the eNecklace™, then what was the point of anything else?

What was the point of anything at all?

The eccessories™ were just the tools for the medication, a mixture of needless and electrical pulses that influenced the body’s blood flow in conjunction with the added Elysia substance to create, inspire, evoke, engineer, happiness.

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

It came in varying degrees, depending on the eccessory™ you used as well as the potency, or ‘mix,’ of Elysia that you bought. Demetri liked all of the mixes (as did everyone of course, how could they not, it was happiness), but his recent favourites included Warm Summer Picnic™, First Kiss™, and Hugs on a Cold Day™ . He had saved up enough recently to purchase his own eNecklace™ but had not yet accumulated enough money to try the recently released Happily Married™. But that didn’t matter, because he was happy, fulfilled even, whatever that meant. Work didn’t tire or stress him, he was happy to do it so he did. He wasn’t a particularly attractive man, but he wasn’t unattractive either, so as long as he was wearing his eNecklace™ women knew they would be happy with him.

‘The most attractive quality to have is a truly happy smile,’ the advertisement proclaimed, and it was true, all people wanted was to be happy, what else mattered? And a smile meant you were happy, right?

In the last few years there had been very few technological advances outside of anything directly related to Elysia, Demetri wondered if there was any point. Wasn’t this the pinnacle of human civilisation, being happy? He imagined the Elysia-Deity staring at a computer screen with the words “GAME OVER: YOU WIN” scrolling across it in the same way the words “Everything is easier when you’re happy, try new ‘Won the Lottery™’ today!” scrolled across the electronic billboard above him, Demetri smiled happily, that mix had been a good one.

 

*Are you really happy?*

If Demetri wasn’t so happy he’d be frustrated hearing that question so often. Of course he was happy, he’d just taken a 6 hour dosage of First Kiss™ and was strolling happily, hands in his pockets, towards a pretty woman he’d made quite inviting  eye contact with.

It occurred to him that he couldn’t actually remember his first kiss.

Why was he thinking that? What did it matter? He shrugged off the thought, letting it fall from his mind like a damp and heavy coat. Yet still it lay, clumped and crumpled there, on the floor of his consciousness. Come on, it couldn’t be so hard to remember something like that. A feeling he was so used to these days…

Lost in his mind, Demetri stumbled on the sidewalk, his idle hands too slow to catch himself and protect his smiling face.

He heard a series of cracks as his jaw crashed against the footpath and left a lovely half-skid of blood as he lifted himself up.

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

He pulled himself up and tried to wipe the red spittle from his face, but instead it just smeared across his cheek, he got the odd feeling that it must look like a long crimson smile.

It hurt.

Their first fight had been in a park, they’d yelled and she’d tried to walk away and he’d caught her and held her. Their first kiss had been there too, it had been raining and she’d been cold. And there, nestled against him, she’d looked up and kissed him.. It had been a year or so before she’d gotten cancer. Cancer was hardly an issue now though, the suffering were given free Elysia, what more could they want, they died happily?

Demetri’s stomach tightened, his chest heaved slightly.

He didn’t want to think about her, the long hours he’d spent by her side in the hospital. The moments and feelings they had shared. No, that wasn’t happy.

           

No.  
No.  
No.  

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

In his head, the deity-doctor seemed to sound concerned, almost frustrated, with Demetri’s lack of answer. What did it matter that she had died? He was happy, everyone in the whole world was so fucking happy all the time, what did it matter.

No.  

No.  

 

He just wanted to be happy, and then he felt it hit him.
A dark wave of nostalgia, fear, anger, pain, frustration, boredom, cold, weakness.

And love.

A wave from an ocean so deep, and thick with restrained thoughts and memories. Feelings from the time his mother had told him his hamster had ‘run away,’ feelings from the time his friend Derrick had joined the ‘cool’ kids, feelings like his mother crying when she only had to make one cup of tea in the morning.
Feelings like a soft kiss in the rain.

Like the rain they washed over him, feelings that affected him, feelings that were different. Feelings that made and unmade him, created him and destroyed him, defined and erased him.

Feelings that were real.

 

*Are you really happy?*

 

And like rain they fell to the ground in front of him, like rain they slid and dripped and stayed.

And then they were gone.

His consciousness writhed in frustration for but a moment, stretching, reaching for any vestiges of the pain.
But it was gone.

Demetri blinked.
He stared at the smooth concrete in front of him.
The scrape of blood was slowly coalescing with a few soft, small drops around it.

 

*Are you really happy?*

Rick Thorn, as nervous as an Altar Boy, went up the dark and creaky stairs in the neighborhood of Emporium Street, and inspected the name on each of the doors until he found the one he wanted. 

He pushed open the door, as he had been told to do, and found himself in a tiny room, which contained no furniture but a plain kitchen table and a rocking chair. On one of the dirty walls were a couple of shelves, containing about a dozen bottles and jars. An old man sat in the rocking chair, reading a newspaper. Rick, without a word, handed him the card he had been given.

“Sit down, Mr. Thorn,” said the old man very politely.

“I am glad to make your acquaintance… but I must ask now, for I will simply collapse if I hold it in any more. Is it true that you have a certain mixture, that has, um, extraordinary effects?”

“Mr. Thorn,” replied the old man, “my stock is not very large. I don’t deal with normal narcotics like pain relievers, anti-depressants, and anti-histamines. I think nothing I sell has the effects which could precisely be described as ordinary.”

“Well, here’s the thing…” began Rick.

“Here, for example,” interrupted the old man, reaching for a bottle from the shelf. “Here is a liquid as colorless as water, almost tasteless, quite imperceptible in coffee, wine, or any other beverage. It is also quite imperceptible to any known method of autopsy.”

“Do you mean it is a poison?” cried Rick, very much horrified. 

“Call it a glove-cleaner if you like,” said the old man indifferently. “Maybe it cleans gloves. I don’t know- I have never tried. One might call it a life cleaner. Lives need cleaning sometimes.”

“I want nothing of the sort,” said Rick.

“Oh, that’s probably for the best,” said the old man. “Do you know the price of this? For one teaspoon, which is enough, I ask twenty thousand dollars. Never less.”

“I hope all your mixtures are not as expensive,” said Rick apprehensively.

“Oh dear, no,” said the old man. “It would be no good charging that sort of price for a love potion, for example. Young people who need a love potion very seldom have twenty thousand dollars. Otherwise, they would not need a love potion.”
“I am glad to hear that,” said Rick.

“I look at it like this,” the old man contemplated. “Please a customer with one article, and he will come back when he needs another. Even if it is more costly. He will save up for it, if necessary.”

“So,” said Rick. “You really do sell love potions?”

“If I did not sell love potions,” said the old man, reaching for another vial, “I should not have mentioned the other matter to you. It is only when one is in a position to oblige that one can afford to be so confidential.”

“And these potions,” said Rick. “They are not, just, um…”

“Oh no,” said the old man. “Their effects are permanent, and extend far beyond the mere casual impulse. But they include it.”

“Dear me!” said Rick, attempting a look of scientific detachment. “How very interesting!”

“But consider the spiritual side,” said the old man.

“I do, indeed,” responded Rick.

“For indifference, she will substitute devotion. For scorn, adoration. Give one tiny measure of this to the young lady- its flavor is imperceptible in orange juice, soup, or cocktails- and she will change forever. She will want nothing but solitude with you.”

“I can hardly believe it,” said Rick. “She is so fond of parties and other people!”

""She will not like them any more,” said the old man. “She will be afraid of the pretty girls you may meet.”

“She will actually be jealous?” cried Rick in a rapture. “Of me?”

“Yes, she will want nothing but you. You will be her sole interest in life.”

“Wonderful!”

“She will want to know all you do. All that has happened to you during the day. Every word of it. She will want to know what you are thinking about, why you smile suddenly, why you are looking sad.”

“This is love!”

“Yes, how carefully she will look after you! She will never allow you to be tired, to stand when you could sit, to neglect your food. If you are an hour late, she will be terrified, and think that you have been killed.”

“I can hardly imagine a Diana like that!” cried Rick, overwhelmed with joy.

“You will not have to use your imagination. And, by the way, since there are always impulses, if by any chance you should, later on, slip a little, you need not worry. She will forgive you, in the end. She will be terribly hurt, of course, but she will forgive you.”

“That will not happen,” said Rick fervently.

“Of course not. But, if you did, you need not worry. She will never divorce you. She will never even be angry at you.”

“And how much is this wonderful mixture?” asked Rick.

“It is not as dear as the glove cleaner. No, that is twenty thousand dollars. One has to be older than you to indulge in that sort of thing. One has to save up for it.”

“But the love potion?”

“Oh, that,” said the old man, opening the drawer in the kitchen table, taking out a tiny, rather dirty looking vial. “That is just a dollar.”

“I can’t tell you how grateful I am,” said Rick, watching him fill it.

“I like to oblige. Then, customers come back, later in life, when they are better off, and want more expensive things. Here you are, You will find it very effective.”

“Thank you again,” said Rick. “Good-bye.”

“Au revoir (until we meet again).”

The horizon gleamed with a sterility usually reserved for more dire and artificial moments. I said her name twice and then once more: “Isabella, Isabella, Isabella.” We had walked at least a mile under the shade of trees and now rested on a sandy perch elongated on the shore of the Chattahoochee. With a gentle nudge she awoke; “Isabella! I thought that you would never open your eyes!” The sunlight was receding behind the brown trees across the river and the nip in the air made the fabric on Isabella’s dress stiffen and crinkle. Each time I touched her she would breathe sharply and then promptly smile as if she was anticipating something. I knew little of seduction, for I was bred into a modest life with people who suspected that there were no better things than what they had already been presented with. My families prominence had dispelled the need for convention- we were of a fortunate lineage and we lived properly but still on terms that we created for ourselves.  The afternoon’s wake had crashed long before we had wound up together beneath the spruce and I was starting to wonder what forces were at play.  I stood up and offered her my hand. “We should go before it gets too dark-I’m not as familiar with this side of the river.” I could smell the cedar that my father had cut into logs burning on the other side of the river; I was certain the estate was farther away. My Mother would always worry when I was gone for too long, but I was incensed with a desire that I had never felt before. I stood and brushed off the red and yellow leaves that had torn as I was lying on them. I offered her my hand as she still remained silent; I wished to get inside of her mind, feel her desire, swim in her thoughts- as if by doing so would make her existence even more real; surely there was a sequence of words to un-muddle  her mind. She looked up at me and smiled. The right strap on her purple sundress had fallen down her shoulder and her high cheekbones rose in such a way that made her eyes squint slightly. “Come, and lie back down- we have at least thirty minutes of sunlight left.” I didn’t want to refuse her, so I laid back down resting my head on a log that had been softened by rain. She rested her head on my chest, and I picked bits of leaf out of her long blonde hair. We both lied still for a while and enjoyed the dusk, and listened to the birds sing beneath an ethereal moon that was starting to appear in the still light, late afternoon. After a few moments she looked up at me: “Do you believe in god?” I didn’t know what to say to her; somehow my mind’s recesses had become filled at that moment and I was unable to ponder an answer. I quipped back nervously: “Sometimes.” I looked away from her and back to the darkening sky. She continued speaking: “I’m just curios. That’s all. Sometimes I don’t believe in him. I remember sitting next to my mother as she died. The hospital didn’t smell at all by the way- it was like they cleaned the death out of the air and made everything neat and they even had a cafeteria! How can you serve food in a place where people are dying all the time? Anyways, I always believed in god; my Mom raised me like that-even as I sat there and watched her die, and watched the tubes pump life into her, I still believed. She had barely enough strength to say anything, but she did say one thing. Before she died, she looked at me and said: even if there’s no heaven, I’ll be with you. No heaven? I thought she was crazy. How could there be no heaven? The next few weeks I thought about what she said over and over, and I still don’t know what to make of it. “I chuckled nervously and said something ridiculous like “yeah well that sure is something” “You’re adorable,” she said, and kissed my cheek. She stood up and I felt a light relief from my chest. She stood in front of me and started to dance. I said: “how can you dance with no music?” She didn’t respond as she did a twirl; I could see beneath her dress as she twirled in the still night air. She stopped and looked at me seriously. Her right strap was still caressing her shoulder. She looked at me for a while and then slowly took her right hand and let her left strap slide down her shoulder and her whole dress came sliding off of her. It was the first time I had seen her nude; she was beautiful.  She was so bold and still so very youthful and I didn’t know what to make of anything so I just sat there amazed. She walked over to me slowly: “What about right now?” “What do you mean?” I asked. “Do you believe in God right now?” Without responding I stood up and kissed her right there on that sandy perch by the Chattahoochee- right there in front of all the birds and crickets, and maybe even in front of god.

I was sprinting through the mansion, running from that... Thing... That was chasing me. I hid in the closet, with the hopes of it not finding me... But, I ran out of my previous luck, it ripped open the closet door and then it happened. Game over. I exit the game and got off my computer, so I could get myself a Coke. While on my way out my room and to the kitchen, I began hearing a... Scratching noise, coming from in the walls. I ignored it, hence, after playing Horror Survival games, I get paranoid. As I opened the fridge, I quickly noticed, and regretted it horribly. I forgot to go to the corner store and buy Coke. I sighed, closed the fridge door, and returned to my room. The scratching had stopped, fortunately. I turned off my computer and went to bed...

I woke up to the sound of my alarm, ""Mondays... How I hate you."", I said, while struggling to drag myself out of bed. When I got up, it instantly struck me, it was Saturday. I slapped the off button of the alarm, and went to my computer. I kicked the button and it came to life, I left the room and went to the kitchen to make myself some coffee. The scratching, it started again. ""GO AWAY!"" I shouted at the walls, but that only made it worse... It got louder. I forgot about the coffee, I just sprinted out of my apartment as fast as I could, now all I wanted was to spend a few nights at a friend's house. As I was walking down the hallway to exit the building, the scratching followed... I began screaming to the top of my lungs while running out of the building and down the streets. People thought I was crazy, but I didn't care, I just wanted the scratching to stop.

When I arrived to my friend's house, I knocked on the door, and no answer. Then I remembered, it was 6:23 AM, clearly he wouldn't be up by then. I walked to the back of his house and grabbed his spare key that he always hid underneath his plant, then I then unlocked the door and walked in. I walked into his kitchen, opened the fridge, and grabbed a can of Coke, I was too lazy to go buy some of my own. Then I started hearing footsteps, coming down the stairs... My friend peaked his head out of the corner, and he looked rather shocked. ""What the hell are you doing here so early?"" said Andy, while scratching his head. ""Oh... Sorry, there's been a rat infestation in my apartment and I needed somewhere to stay."", Andy nodded for me to sit on his couch, and for three hours we watched TV, but then he started asking a bunch of questions. ""So, if you were here at 6:23 AM, how come I've been getting messages from you on my laptop at around 7:00 AM?"" I sat there, shocked... I forgot to turn off my computer, and I lived alone. I instantly told him I had to go check my apartment and I left his home. 

When I entered that apartment, it was a mess... My tables, flipped, my fridge had it's contents spilled onto the floor, my pictures were shattered... It was rather horrible. I called the police and told them there may be a possible intruder, and sure enough, moments later a police vehicle stopped at the sidewalk and two police officers exit the vehicle. They entered my apartment, searched the place for any broken windows, and found nothing. They went to ask for witnesses by speaking to my neighbors, and I could hear them faintly... ""Good morning, madam, did you see any...."" ""Oh, officer, he's been acting rather crazy lately...."" ""Alright, thank you for your time..."" The officer entered my apartment, once more, and began giving me a lecture about prank calling the police... He thought I was lying?! I told him exactly everything I know, and when I told him about staying at Andy's, he seemed to get uncomfortable. He simply told me he didn't want to receive calls from me again, and then he left. I didn't even want to stay in that apartment anymore, as soon as the officer left I did too.

Since I was young I had always found closure in the river next to my home.  I would always go and camp by the riverside whenever I had the chance.  The feeling was like no other to get away from the business of life and relax in the stillness that nature had to offer.  
I recall one time I went camping.  The day started off like every other day, I woke up in my one man tent to the comfort of my Colman sleeping bag.  The crisp, morning air scorched my nostrils as I slowly rose from my slumber.  I exited my tent and stood still in my camp listening to the slow, rhythmic splashes of the river.  The sound put my mind into a trance as I tried to shake the sleepiness that the morning brings.  While standing still I heard the giggling of a group of girls.  An early morning tubing brigade was in the making.  One could tell just by looking at this group that this was not their first time around the bend.  There were about four of them, each with their individual coolers that were probably not filled with pop and bottled water.  
Knowing the history of the Crow Wing River I assumed that these girls were going to slowly float down to the bridge trying to catch an early morning buzz.  With each empty beer they would gossip about boys and try to one up each other with their “personal” experiences.  I had to chuckle softly to myself, thinking of what those girls were going to talk about, and knowing that I was going to join them on the river in the hours to come.
I turned my back to the river and headed for my cooler, trying to find something to cure my morning hunger.  I opened the lid and found six beers, a loaf of wheat bread, some venison steaks, and a freezer bag of premade pancakes.  I pulled out the pancakes and opened the bag. A brief smell of stale bread brushed my nose, but I was too hungry to care.  I sat in my folding chair as I ate my breakfast.  While I sat and ate, I listened to the music of the woods.  The birds were singing their good morning song, the trees creaking to the light wind that wisped over the land.  I ate half of the bag of pancakes and threw the rest into the woods so the birds could have breakfast as well.
I started to clean up my camp a bit and get ready for the day’s activities.  I had planned on tubing the river that day, and that is what I was going to do.  I retrieved my tube from the back of my car and took out the cold Bud Light’s that were in my cooler.  Being only sixteen at the time I was at risk of getting caught, but the area was so remote that there was only a slight chance.  I made my way down to the river, slowly wading in to check the water.  The water was cold, but not shockingly cold.  I was only knee deep in the water and I threw my tube in.  With beer in hand I submerged my body underneath the water.  There was a momentary pain in my trunks, but it went away fast as my whole body was chilled.  I came up next to my tube and climbed in.  The sun was beaming down on my body and it felt good on my freshly chilled skin.  I started rowing with my hands trying to find the right spot in the river where I could just sit and let the current do all the work. 
 I made my way down the river, sipping on my beer and lost in my thoughts.  My mind started running with all of my life’s stresses, school, grades, football and girls.  I, not knowingly, entered the first of many bends in the river and became stuck on the edge.  On one side there was a forest filled with brush and on the other was a small meadow where deer were known to bed.  I was brought back from my thoughts as I was stuck for a short while.  When I looked up I was presented with a picturesque scene.  A faun was jumping around in the meadow, happy to be alive.  I could tell it was young from the spots it still had.  The faun seemed to have not a care in the world, rolling in the grass that grew thick in the meadow.  I slowly pushed off from the shore, still looking at this being full of life.  I quietly passed by the faun, yet midway through I had to cough.  The noise shook the little deer and its ears perked up.  The faun found my position in the river and I froze solid, trying not to make it run away. We stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity.  As I slowly moved with the river I lost contact with the faun, but heard it resume frolicking in its meadow.
I started to think of the faun, how it didn’t scare when it saw me, how it found me nonthreatening and how its will to play was greater than its will to run.  I pondered our meeting while the river swept me away.  The faun was stricken with fear when it saw me, yet it overcame that fear so it could play and be happy.  I was transfixed by this topic until the river brought me to a group of five children; all of them not older then thirteen.  They were swinging from a rope tied onto a tree that grew over the river.  They were taking turns grabbing onto the rope and swinging into the water.  Nothing could break their happiness.  They were laughing as each one hit the water and came up with a huge grin.  As I watched I thought how lucky they were, to be young and not care about the stresses that I had to endure.  All they knew was that swinging off the rope into the river was fun and that is all they needed to know.  
I made my way farther down the river still thinking about the faun and the children when I came across a tree that had fallen into the river.  I put my hands in the water and maneuvered around the fallen tree.  As I passed I started wondering how that could be, how the tree was so tall and scraping the sky one day and the next it was dead in the water.  The idea hit me that all trees do is stay stationary in one spot all of their life, waiting for death to fall upon them.  They wait and watch as the world around them bustles with life, not able to do anything about it.  They wait for their roots to give out and just the right amount of wind to push them over.  All they can do is sit and wait for their demise.  
The current then took me farther down the river and I could see my destination.  My destination was Mary Brown Bridge.  The bridge was covered in graffiti from each graduating class of the surrounding schools.  As I came closer I could hear the slurred yelling from the group of girls that left before me.  They were standing on the side of the bridge jumping into the river like it was their job.  After each one would jump they would whoop and holler, while they took another chug of beer.  I made it to the bank of the bridge and slowly rose from my tube, I didn’t realize how much I had actually drunk on the river, and I stumbled my way up onto the bridge.  The girls noticed my presence and beckoned me to join them in their end of float fun.  As I walked to the side of the bridge fear overcame my body.  The risk of drowning subdued me from jumping as I placed my hands on the wall and looked down at the water.  The river was high this year so the current was really strong, especially under the bridge.
My legs started to buckle in fear as the girls provoked me to jump.  I started thinking about the children that didn’t care if they got hurt jumping into the river; they were having too much fun.  I thought of the faun and how it overcame its fear so it could frolic around, not caring who was watching.  I thought about how the tree stood still its whole life, and then died without any accomplishments, how it was alive one day and gone the next.  The risk of drowning started to die down and courage arose within me.  Life is too short to not take risks, to not have fun.  I then got up on the edge of the bridge, the girls started to cheer, and I jumped.

For some odd reason I felt as if I hadn’t gone through the door, yet I clearly remember going through it. The door which was of a matter I couldn’t quite piece together. It seemed to be a dark-ish kind of colouring. Yet, somehow, it seemed to eat up all the light around it. As if it was darkness incarnate. The moment I opened the door I knew it had been a mistake and that I shouldn’t have fed my curiosity. Something goaded me to go through it, though.


After I went through the door, my perception was altered. I knew nothing would be what it had been previously. The reality I had once known had forever shifted. I wasn’t sure if I would be able to cope with this new reality once I left the door. The door seemed to exist on another plane, not quite the same plane of existence I had been in my entire life. I knew once I returned no one would believe the things I saw, the horrors that lived in the door.


When I first started traveling the infinite expanses of my mind I had stumbled upon a great many of things, none quite like this door. When I first saw it I thought that it had led nowhere and much to my horror this door did in fact lead nowhere. I think the door led me into itself, which in turn created a portal that would never close. It seemed that whenever I dosed off, that same portal starts to suck me back in. Tilting the very fabric of my physical world, the equilibrium I had once known was now ever shifting.


I began to regret my decision to travel through the door. I began to wonder if the saying that curiosity killed the cat was meant for people like me and that cat was a code word for sanity. The line in which people call the line of time began overlapping itself in my world. I began to wonder if time still existed in my reality. Things began to become a blur, it wasn’t the kind of blur you can fix with glasses. This kind of blur was a blur that wasn’t really there, yet somehow I saw it and it made everything fuzzy.


I began to wonder how many times I could enter the door and return. How long would it be before I lost my way back? The sanity I had once held so dear to me was now just a figment of my own imagination, much like the door. The door, by all technicalities didn’t exist, but who says something needs to exist for it to be made a reality.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_10xu0i,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/10xu0i/the_door/,

	I never wanted this... I thought by leaving Earth I could escape the shitty lot in life I had, but boy was I wrong. I’ve been hopping from colony to colony to for about a year now. First I tried to find some work on several lunar colonies, to no avail. Then I hitched a ride out to Mars on the little credit I had left. I was able to scrape enough money to get to Ceres, where I found work for one of the science research teams there. I really enjoyed Ceres, I could have stayed there for quite a while, but just like everything else that’s ever gone right for me, it was crushed. An experiment involving a miniscule amount of anti-matter while I was off-duty completely destroyed our lab, putting me out of work, thankfully I had made enough off of my research to finally get me to Jupiter. That’s where I’m headed now, to a Jovian Platform, one devoted to science and discovery, one where I will strive.

--The Seventh Column--

	“The Seventh Column will be departing in 10 standard minutes.” announced the robotic voice of the loudspeaker, though I could hardly hear it. It’s loud here on Mars, far different than Ceres, where it was quiet and peaceful. I had to return to Mars to find a ship that could take me to Jupiter, big ships like that never stop at Ceres. The Seventh Column was the cheapest ride I could find, well within my tight budget of 6 billion credits. I already had a job waiting for me on the Jovian Platform Scipio, a well paying job researching anti-matter physics, just like on Ceres. The only difference is that Scipio has real funding, with much better equipment than I could’ve dreamed of on Ceres. 

	“The Seventh Column will be departing in 5 standard minutes.”came from the loudspeaker as I checked and made sure I had everything, when I heard footsteps. I was on a fairly empty flight, with plenty of room for everyone to stay away from each other. There was no reason for anyone to be near me, and judging by the number of footsteps, this was a group of people. I looked up, and three men were standing in front of me. Rugged, worn by space travel, they had probably never seen the light of Earth. 

	“Are you Isav Re’e?” asked the man on my right, who stood slightly behind the man in the center, who was clearly the leader.

	“Yes, that I am.” I said. “Why?” This wasn’t looking good, they were using one of my old aliases.

	“We’ve been looking for you... You were stupid to come back here.” said the man on my left, who I began to recognize. The tattoo on the right side of his neck gave him away, it was the symbol of the male, with a dot in the center. He was from the Maln Clan, who I worked for briefly before I left Mars the first time. I left on not so pleasant terms, too.

	“Shuttup, Ronin.” said the center man. “Look, Young, we don’t want a mess here. Come with us peacefully and we’ll make sure you aren’t hurt. If you don’t comply then... I can’t guarantee your safety.” I was in a bind, I had less than five minutes so if I left I’d miss the flight, and lose my job on Jupiter, but if I tried to stay, these guys would drag me out by force. I needed to act quickly.

	“Alright, just let me get my things, I’ve got a bag in the back.” I lied. I got up and started walking to the cargo bay, where no-one was stationed.

	“Alright, just hurry up, we don’t got all day.” said Ronin, as they began to follow me back. They had taken the bait, now I just had to reel them in. I did some quick mental predictions and chose the one with the best chances. I reached up and grabbed a large bag, and as I pulled it down I slammed it into Ronin’s face, knocking him out instantly. I dove behind a shelf and grabbed another bag, this one a little smaller, perfect to use with one hand. I waited for the other two to round the corner until I threw the bag at the other cronnie while I tripped the leader. As soon as his head hit the ground I slammed my fist upwards into his nose, killing him. I did the same to Ronin and the other one, and stuffed their bodies in a small nook of an access corridor. 

	I got back to my seat as two crew members were coming towards me. They were asking all the passengers about something, tickets I guess. I was still trying to process what had just happened, when they approached me.

	“Excuse me sir, have you seen these three men on the ship?” the crewman, whose I.D. badge read Aman, showed me a Holopane with the image of the three men who attacked me. My face went hot, my head started spinning, but I was able to compose myself.

	“No, why?” I replied.

	“They requested to come see someone on the ship, but we didn’t see them come out.” said the second man, whose I.D. badge read Czevk.

	“Can’t you check the surveillance to see if they did come out?”

	“Afraid not, cameras broken. That’s why we’re asking the passengers. Everyone else said they saw them, but you didn’t, correct?” said Czevk.

	“That’s right, sir.” I replied, I was starting to sweat.

	“Alright, well, I guess they didn’t come this far back. They’re probably hiding somewhere up front.” said Aman.

	“Maybe they slipped by you and you didn’t notice. You guys were preparing to set off right?”

	“Yeah, that’s true...” said Aman looking over at Czevk. “Ah, fuck it, let’s go. I’m ready to get out of here.” He looked back at me, “Thanks for co-operating, Mr.?”

	“Young. Dr. Isais Carson Young.” I replied.

	“Thank you, Dr. Young.” said Aman, who then walked off with Czevk.

	“We apologize for the wait, The Seventh Column will now be departing from Docking Bay 823.B heading for Jupiter’s Orbital Station.” announced the loudspeaker as the ship began to hum. I had grown accustomed to the feeling over the past two years, but it never ceased to please me. It calmed me down so much it was amusing.

Suffocated to sleep by the left over stench of your recent smoke. 

Flattered by your Love Day date proposition, 

But I (run, run, runnnnn) hit the books instead. 

Days in the Children’s Psych hospital, you were once too similar to them, priceless.

You spy me across the SXSW crowd, 

And hold my hand all the way to the “safety” of an alleyway. 

A kiss goodbye as you pick up some Brits. 

You teach me so much. 

Nocturnal animals chirp from the Bridge. 

A trip to your Water job where you were fired, 

And a run through the Park with your wolf. 

You gave my leftovers from your Birthday Dinner to a homeless man. 

Learning that you care. And Learning that I was…not very nice. 

.Longing Through SUMMER. 

Thoughts of him faded into thoughts of you. 

Belgium, Turkey, Germany, France, 

But I lost the souvenir that I handpicked for you. 

Angelic voicemail on my 22nd, 

And a late night Visit as you return from pyramid building. 

PSYCHO NEIGHBOR (!) makes me long for you, as you begin to slip away.

“Well, Todo we aren’t in Texas anymore.”

Ella laughs and says,” But really, what is that? The sun is in my eyes.”
The Texas sun is blinding and the air is heavy with humidity. The clouds move as fast as the San Marcos River roiling through the man made pathways. There is not an open spot on the grassy hill, and the sounds of faded conversations fill our ears with the nonsense of college students trying too hard to impress each other.

“I think that it is looking at us,” Ryan says in a whisper with a questioning tone.

As our shadows pass over it, its pleading eyes began to open. Glazed over and too weak to move, it felt our presence. Its legs quiver as it looks up at us with pure pathetic eyes. The thoughts cross our minds that it is given to fly. It is using its last breath to grasp our attention or anyone else who might give a damn.

Ryan looks over to it and says,” You alright there little buddy?”

Ella answers with a sigh and says,” I actually think that it’s dieing. I can’t believe that no one else has noticed.”

Ryan says bluntly, “Oh, I think that people noticed. They probably didn’t care.”

Its pink bare skin and some bone are exposed. Its neck is completely mangled with no sympathy. To say the least, its tortured end of life is disturbing to witness and drawing near. Realizing that we are its last hope not to be forgotten, we decided to notify the park service.

“Sorry guys, I don’t know if there is too much we can do to save it. I mean it’s just a vulture. If it was exotic or rare we would have a better chance.” Reluctantly he says, “But I’ll go ahead and give the animal shelter a ring and, uh, see what we can do for yall. Thanks for letting me know. Um, in the mean time I’ll cover it with a trashcan because I don’t want anyone to be disturbed. You know what I mean?”

As they began to walk away Ella lightened the mood by saying, “ Well, I guess not all birds are created equal either.”

Ryan answered, “Yeah, I agree with you. Who knew that man even created a cast system for birds?”",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_zzdmi,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/zzdmi/unthought_known_flaws_of_man/,

Its my very first short story and I just wanted to put it out there, see what everything thinks.  Thanks for reading and letting me know what you think!

""I'm picking up my baby bumblebee.  Won't my mommy be so proud of me!""

I frantically bombard the walls that have become my prison.  Panic sets in as tiny fragments of light stream in.  Is it just me or are these walls sweating?  It’s as if the walls are alive, breathing, perspiring, anticipating.  

Moments ago my antennae was deep inside a particularly fragrant and productive pollen mine.  Pink with streaks of white, this mine smelled sweet like home.  Home.  Will I ever see home again?  The perfect geometrical patterns of the combs, sticky with the luscious elixir of life.

There is a high pitched noise that I have suddenly become aware of.  An indecipherable amalgamation of sounds, I have a suspicion that the sound is a voice, communicating to me.  I have heard stories of this phenomenon.  Singing, they call it. 

I must escape!  Using the only tool available to me I unleash my weapon stabbing the walls in a desperate attempt to break through the impenetrable fortress.  Once.  Twice.  This is fruitless.
 
“Owww!  He stung me!”

I’m free!  I’ve been released!  With that combination of sounds my captor has been persuaded to set me free!  Free to feel the open air, free to mine for the queen, free to fulfill my duty to society!  

 “I’m squishing up my baby bumblebee, won’t my mommy be so proud of me!”

The impact comes before I can register the danger I am in.  A rush of air denies me my initial path out the front of my cell while I feel the shadows of my walls enclosing me again.  This time the walls do not stop at cell like proportions; they suffocate me with their closeness.  
Now the walls are moving, gyrating against themselves.  I realize now that I am the reason.  The songs, the cell, the temporary release.  All of it was done as a lead up to this moment.  I can hear the voice repeating those fateful words.

“Won’t my mommy be so proud of me”.  

I feel myself expanding, flattening into a paste.  As the walls continue their deliberate torture I am struck by the suddenness of it all.  You never truly embrace things until they’re gone.  My queen, the sweet elixir of life, the fresh air.  All of it, lost to the whims of this creature.  Will your mommy be so proud of you?  She better be.

My feet barely touch the mass beneath me and I approach the tip of the wing, the wind screaming beautifully past me, a rush like the flow of blood through an artery, like a wave of water crushing a swimmer for a moment before allowing her respite, the swell of breath as you feel a lover’s touch on your thigh, her eyes locking with yours before her lips do the same. My left foot touches the edge, heel to toe; my knee flexes, and for a moment I think I hesitate, but perhaps I don’t and just wish I had. Perhaps I am pushed.  I launch and turn backwards, flipping so I can see the plane behind me, the earth upside down and for a moment, the briefest moment, I’m suspended in the air. According to physics it’s at this moment where I’m not moving in any direction. There is nothing pushing me this way or that, no commitment to worry about, no forces act on me at all. Then I fall towards the earth speeding along towards the cities, commitment, life, reality. For the next several minutes I feel myself speeding up, crushing down at the solid ground. Finally it feels like I’m not falling. I feel suspended again, floating full of life and feeling and power here 10,000 feet above terra firma. 

Pushing through the sky like a bottle opener into a cork, I spin and spin diving further and further towards a certainty I cannot escape. Clouds come into view, glorious and looming. I see them so often from the ground they have become meaningless; up here where it’s different I see them for what they are: constantly shifting bodies. Clouds don’t move, they come into being in a different space, while leaving other parts to wisp away into the wind. They pulse and breathe. They hold you for a moment and then release you. Inside the cloud there’s a magic, a concrete feeling of luscious glory that lasts momentarily before I exit. Clouds come and go as do I, entering and exiting them at a velocity best described as wonderful but dizzying. 

The ground is closer and more real than ever, and it’s time to pull. Put a stop to this freedom and embrace safety, end the charade of a freewheeling care-free young man and settle down. The equivalent of a wife and minivan, the kids and the bills and the security of others. Someone who doesn’t just give you the thrill and leave you, something that doesn’t feel like a one night stand. Time to plant your feet on solid ground. 

I fall, hand on the cord, eyes on the altimeter, and slowly rotate so I fall looking at the sky. Looking at where I was, seeing how far I’ve come and wishing I was one minute ago, three days ago, 6 months ago. Being dropped is terrible, falling is exhilarating, but finding ground again…

Finding ground again is frightening. The idea of walking around miles below where you were and having to work to get back up here to the sky: well honestly it’s goddam awful. I want to be up in the sky again already, looking down at everyone beneath me, I want to be high up again. But no, right now I’m falling; falling increasingly faster and faster. The ground is rushing at me, that which was so unimportant only a moment ago is now so very important. 

I think of what it took to get here. The training, the practice, the years of waiting, the checking of gas, wheels, equipment, radio, wings, instruments, and all the work just to reach the air. Learning and practice and practice and trust and building something that could work. Only to find yourself up high above the world, above it all, nothing can touch you. Packing the chute…

Oh god the parachute. I touch the cord handle of the cord and recall this fall isn’t like the others. I’ve been here before, but I always landed softly, holding the plastic handle that was attached to my chute. There’s nothing safe about it this time. This time I will land hard. I’m passed the moment where I can actually deploy and safely land on the ground. I yank hard on the cord and my chute rips open; a chest with ribs broken and a heart looking at the surgeon beating softly with the thump of a speaker. Wind fills the parachute and I feel myself slow down incredibly fast. I look down and I see the ground only one hundred feet away. I brace myself and try to glide in along the ground, I pull my feet up and I pull the cords by me and I look and I scream, my mouth opens wide and it all comes flying out of me. I slide through high grass going far too fast; my body instinctively curls up and I roll along the ground cracking bones, bruising ribs, and generally fucking up my body. I inhale dirt and scrape a gash on my shin that deposits blood on the ground every few feet. The roll last 6 seconds, but I feel like I’ve been tumbling for months. Dust is everywhere and the cloud billows up around me as I finally come to rest on the ground. 

Broken, bruised, beaten, busted up and generally destroyed on every level of existence. I cough and blood mixes into the bare grass around me and I contemplate laying here forever. The sun is fading in the west I look over at it, and I watch, laying down in a mixture of brown, red, green, and yellow and realize that there’s nothing that has to happen, there’s nothing that is more important than finding my own strength and standing up to say I’m ready. I slowly rise up to my knees, and then one foot at a time, I stand up. I watch the sun burn the remnants of the day away, a bright orange ball that everyday cooks the world to a crisp, only to show up the next morning to a fresh new set of ingredients; ready to burn again. The sun’s flames lick the ground and for a moment, a lifetime of a moment, the ground glows red along the entire horizon. I shrug off my parachute and look back up the sky. 

I’ll be back up there again soon.

Those two sentences have always haunted me, ever since I first heard the heard the short story they belonged to for the first time as a small boy. I don’t remember what happens after that, nor do I care. I would have nightmares, waking up screaming in the middle of the night without knowing why, just hearing those words echoing throughout my mind. By the time I was seven, I’d been to four different psychiatrists. None of them helped. I never had any friends, because no one wants to be friends with a pale, twitchy, wide-eyed boy who was known for flipping out in the middle of class, screaming incomprehensibly and sobbing. I didn’t care. I still don’t now. They just didn’t understand. They didn’t then and they don’t now. Let them laugh. Let them mock me. I knew the truth, even back then as a kid. I knew the truth, even though I didn’t know I knew it. I wasn’t crazy, and I’m not now. Sometimes, sometimes I felt like I really was the only person there. All the hate, war, greed, fear. Why? Why was it there? Why was it considered normal? I didn’t know. I couldn’t understand why. Of course, I do now. But I’m getting ahead of myself. 

The truth.

I finally realized what I had known my whole life two days ago. I was at my job. I worked in a small store. We had food, toys, clothes. I was a gofer. Stacked boxes, took inventory, cleaned, whatever was needed of me. It was glamorous, but it paid the rent on my apartment with enough left over for bills and food. On this day, two days ago, a teenage boy, maybe 15 or 16, came into the store. His young, clear face was ugly with smug self-importance. He ignored the cashier’s polite greeting, making a beeline for the candy aisle where I was stacking Twix bars beside the rest of the chocolates. He shouldered his way past me with a contemptuous smirk, knocking a handful of chocolate bars from my grasp. I didn’t say a word. Why bother? I just bent down and picked them up and put them on the shelf. Then I noticed the kid again. He was stuffing his jacket pockets with gum and candy. He saw me looking and sneered, strolling past me again. I grabbed his shoulder, trying to get him to put them back, since he obviously had no intention of paying. In a single movement he whipped his arm up and hit me across the face. I saw stars for a second, losing my grip on him. I stared at him, the blow to my head finally revealing what had been hidden. The malevolent glitter in his eyes, masking the inhuman evil within. He wasn’t human. He was some kind of creature here for the sole purpose of causing pain and suffering. He stepped towards me, his mouth opening and releasing a challenge. I took a step back, shaking. I knew now. We weren’t alone. There were Others. He…no, IT laughed, an awful sound that grated my ears. It turned to walk out, and in that instance I realized what I had to do. I couldn’t let this evil creature continue its cruelty. I grabbed the closest thing, a small electric razor that we had been using for a demonstration. I leapt forward and slammed the thick metal end into the back of its skull. It let out a primal shriek of pain, collapsing to the floor. The cashier, his name was Danny, yelled something, obviously shocked by the creatures inhumanity.  I dropped onto its back, my knees digging into its spine. I flicked the razor on, the low buzzing barely audible over the creatures shrieking yells. I’m not a hunter, I don’t know how to kill something quickly. I shoved the head of the buzzing razor into the back of its neck. The skin broke quickly, blood flowing and coating my hands. I pressed harder, hearing wet ripping sounds as the razor shredded skin and muscle. I tossed it aside after it died, clogged by the creature’s flesh. Yet it still lived, screaming and thrashing under me. I stood and kicked it onto its back, blood puddling from its ravaged neck. It stared up at me with terrified, watering eyes, realizing its reign of evil was over. I brought my foot down into its face, over and over and over. Bone crunched and snapped under my shoe, blood and gore spurting across the floor and my legs. I smashed its head into a misshapen pulp, its brains smeared under it. Panting slightly, I turned to Danny, ready to share a celebratory moment with him. Instead, I saw him on the phone, babbling to the police. Then my second revelation came. He was one too. This time, there was no hesitation. I jumped over the counter and smashed the phone into the floor, then grabbed the second creature by the hair and neck and slammed it into the window. It shattered upon impact, and when I yanked it back, it had shards of glass embedded in its face. One had punctured his eyeball, the bloody ruin dripping fluid. There was one huge, jagged piece lodged in its throat, which it clawed at desperately, no doubt to use against me. I tore it out, then used it to slash again and again at the monstrosity’s face, heedless of the cuts I sustained to my own hand. Finally, it too was dead, if it was ever alive to begin with. Then I ran. Who knew how many more were in the area, if they could communicate telepathically. Even as this horrific thought occurred to me, I realized that I was surrounded by the creatures as soon as I stepped outside. Every person who walked by was a creature. I was the only one as far as I could see. I ran, shoving them away, ignoring their grasping, outstretched hands and stares of horror at the blood of their unholy kin drenched into my skin and clothes. There was a gun store close by. I needed to arm myself, prepare for the immanent retaliatory strike for the destruction of their brethren. But even the owner of the store was one. It garbled some unholy phrase as he pointed at me in shock, surprised that someone had realized the truth. It reached for something under the counter, but I was on top of it before it could, pulling a pistol off the wall as I did, caving its head in with the butt of the gun. Once it, too, had been exterminated, I loaded up on guns and ammunition. I had to be ready. I had to prepare. They knew that I knew. They were coming for me. I made it back to my apartment without any more problems, all of the other creatures, for I saw no more humans, just more and more of these imposters, fled as they saw the arsenal I carried. 

I’ve been in my apartment since then, sitting in a chair in the kitchen, my weapons on the table before me, loaded and ready to destroy any and all of the creatures. A few have knocked, but I wont let them in. A few have even called out, mimicking the voices of my neighbors. They’ve been growing increasingly urgent. They fear me. Good. My fear is over. I understand. 

I understand.
I finally understand why that phrase has taunted me.
It was as though it was written for me. 

I sit alone in my apartment, the last man on Earth. I can hear them, more than ever. They yell, banging on the door. Claim to be police. Obviously they want to kill me. I won’t let them. I’m the only one left. Or was I the only one there ever was? They’re knocking. Go away. Go away! I won’t let them in!

I won’t let them in.
I won’t let them in.
I won’t let them in I won’t let them in I won’t let them in i wont let them iniwontlettheminwontwontwontwontwontwont

1343546722.0,6,self.shortstories,xc22h,Plethora,SplinteredBA,6,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/xc22h/plethora/,"Smoke billowed from the window of a broke-down truck that always sat at the edge of Potts farm. Nobody knew how or when the dusty behemoth of a vehicle ended up where it was. All that was known was that it had been there for years on end, never claimed and never moved. Incapable of any motion, the vehicle was often the place that delinquents and vagabonds aplenty decided to make their little niche in the world. Sitting in the front seat, Matthew Delaney smoked the Marlboro in his lips slowly.  A down-to-earth country boy, Matthew fit the part with a pair of dusty overalls and a tank top worn underneath. Scrawny to the letter and hiding his eyes behind a tangled mess of sweat-laced hair, he wasn't exactly the most attractive or noteworthy of people in the small farming colony of Plethora. A glance over brought attention to the old rifle he had stolen from his father's case. A Winchester by make, the rifle was known for its solid performance, even as old as it was. Today, it seemed, was the day that Matthew had decided to die. Another gentle puff of the cigarette brought his mind back, spiraling through the mesh of memories and thoughts he had locked away for the day. What had brought him to this point? The breakup. That's right. Amber McGraw, a girl he had been with for nearly two years had decided that they were looking at different ends of a circle. They would arrive at the same points, but regardless of how much they moved their plans around, there was never a solid corner to settle into. A shake of his head brought Matthew back to the present, a blemish of a day in his perfect plan of life. Everything he had known in the world had come to a close and there was no new chapter to this book. No sequels, no trilogy or saga to keep him wondering what came next.

Sighing, Matthew flicked the cigarette from the door and grabbed the rifle from the passenger's seat. Kicking the door as he pulled the handle, the old metal swung open with a contesting creak and squealed to rest once open halfway. Squeezing out of the narrow opening, Matthew walked to the front of the truck and leaned back. The cold metal of the grill met his back with a smack and Matthew soon found himself sliding to sit with his knees propped up. Dropping his head back, he let it rest on the truck's grill as he gazed into the night sky. Earth had been a sight back whenever he had first lived there. The large white moon above with stars littering the sky had kept him rather enraptured as a young boy. At the age of twenty-seven, however, Matthew found the night sky of Plethora to be a bit lackluster. There was no moon, only stars. The sky wasn't even that dark here. A darker shade of red, perhaps, but the early sun's rotation did little to give a working man a real moment's sleep. Shaking his head, Matthew looked down once more at the rifle he held. At least he'd be found soon. People would be out and about in an hour at the latest. Since the old “Pott's Truck” was a landmark into and out of the primary farming community that the colony was known for, someone was bound to find the poor man's body where it would undoubtedly be lying. No coyotes or decay for him. He'd at least have the dignity of a decent burial. Firming his resolve, Matthew shifted the rifle until it was placed squarely in his mouth and moved his hand towards the trigger.

Before he had even so much as touched the trigger guard, however, an explosion rocked the world around him. Wind, dust, and rocks flew towards Matthew, who was quick to drop to the side, evading a rather large rock that had been kicked up and sent his way. Forgotten was the rifle and his previous resolution, the old weapon hitting the ground with a dull clang compared to the sudden rush of noise and action around the man. Whenever his vision cleared up, Matthew went wide-eyed with disbelief. There before him, battling what Matthew had once considered friends and coworkers, was the lapdog of the Unified Colony Directorate. Aiden Desparius, a gene-soldier, was an impressive figure to find on any battlefield. Standing at just under 6 feet flat and sporting a goatee that looked as if it belonged on some cartoon villain's face, he was impressive enough without the gear he had strapped to his body armor. White flesh shifted as he dived to the side, evading a stray rifle's bullet. Muscles tightened and flexed as he punched one farmer, who dared to get close with his knife, in the nose. To see him battling a bunch of farmers and laborers was more than enough shock and confusion for Matthew, who could only watch in wonder before the desire to save his fellows overwhelmed the man's mind. Stumbling for the abandoned Winchester, Matthew raised it shakily to his shoulder and aimed at the soldier fighting his people. Unseen, he fired off the round and managed a hit. A small cheer lifted from his mouth whenever he saw Aiden crumple, one immediately copied by the farmer's around him. It died, however, whenever Aiden rose slowly from the ground. Spitting to the side, he glanced at the hole in his shoulder and turned to where the shot came from. “Mother fucker.” 

They were to be the last two words Matthew heard in his current life. Seeing Aiden vanish before his eyes, Matthew gave a startled yelp and attempted to flee from where he was hunched. He had intended to kill himself that day, but now felt the very real desire to remain alive now that he had an enemy who cared enough about him to want him dead. He knew Aiden's gift, as most did, and did his best to run before the soldier reappeared. He wasn't quick enough. Aiden reappeared explosively, his body forming in midair in the space that Matthew inhabited. Vitae and organs spread like a rain, Matthew's body unable to contain the sudden stress of someone else occupying the exact space it did. The poor man's master plan for dying peacefully and with a proper funeral were shattered in the same instant that Matthew simply ceased to exist. It didn't take long for Aiden to finish his compatriots after their morale shattered, seeing such gruesome brutality.

I sat in my tiny room in the dirty Tokyo hostel and sucked down the flask bottle of whiskey. Kentucky bourbon made me feel closer to home than anything else. I contemplated the mysteries of the white wall a few feet from my face, and it must have spoken to me in some fashion for I felt a sudden compulsion to walk the dark streets and find companionship in the lonely city. I walked across one of the Asakusa bridges with that half drunken gait where you feel pushed along, rather than pushing yourself. I found myself pushed to the local foreigner bar and happily entered. Warm light came into the misty night as I opened the door and I was greeted with the sounds of music and laughter, the smell of beer and bourbon, and the touch of inebriated white hands clapping my back. There is a camaraderie among foreigners abroad unlike anything else. You truly are strangers in a strange land, and you wander alone all day through concrete tunnels lined with strange symbols and never talking, yet surrounded by bustling conversation always, and then at night you find each other and talk boisterously and smile always, and you ask ""What country?"" and tell how much you love Spain, or France, or England, and they tell you about how they love America so. You talk about where you've been, and where you'll be tomorrow. People filter in and out, and every night new people and old friends departing, for they must catch a plane tomorrow. Then at midnight is last call and everyone spills into the streets. Whiskey at the 7-11 and then a trip to the river where you lay about and speak of life and home and the glory of the journey. As I lay on my back I realize I feel closer to these strangers than anyone I know, and it is a comforting realization that you can find companionship in the loneliest of places, and that tomorrow there will be new friends and new liquor and that you will never be truly alone.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_x0xos,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/x0xos/tokyo_japan/,

A few dings, a couple of bangs, that was typical. Not like this. This sounded like something gone wrong. Kat pushed up off the couch, wandered her way to the door connecting the house to the garage, and leaned in the frame of it.

There was Vincis, standing in front of a car; its hood was up and he was staring into it’s guts as if it had verbally accosted him, as if it had offended him, personally. 

Kat frowned just a bit. She didn’t know who the car belonged to, but she did know it was some high roller, someone who could possibly make Vincis’ day a little less pleasant, if he so felt like it. And why not, right? Why not heap more issues on a guy that was already so high strung, they could use him for the telegraph?

Quietly, she stepped into the garage - but not quietly enough. This was, after all, Vincis’ domain, and nothing happened in here without his knowledge. She got about halfway to him when he turned his head, looking at her out of the corner of his eye. Impossibly bright and blue, eyes he got from his father, much to his dismay. 

“H-Hey,” he said, a hint of a smile trying to make it across his features. It didn’t quite make it, but she noticed the attempt. It was enough in her book. “I’m s-sorry. Was I m-making t-too much noise?”

She smiled at him, shaking her head. “Nah, not too much.” Soon she was right beside him, and neatly checked him with her hip. “What are you working on?” And instantly, she could see the way Vincis’ features, which had just started to relax, tighten up again. He turned back forward, gesturing with his hand to the car before them, lips dipping into a frown. 

“I c-can’t figure out wh-what’s wrong with it. I’ve tried everyth-thing.” Here, he reached up, running his hand through his hair - something Kat knew he only did, especially with greasy hands, when he was truly upset. Vincis tended to view cars as puzzles - and if he couldn’t fix one….well. 

This was his talent. If he were incapable of fixing a car, he generally thought it to mean that he was incapable of performing and from there, things just went downhill. It was the little things that always bothered Vincis, not the big things. Launch an idea at him that might terrify another man, and he handled it like a champ. Give him a car he couldn’t fix?

He tended to take that poorly. Add in the fact that the car happened to belong to some big-wig, and Kat was pretty sure that all was not well upstairs. 

The slim, delicate line of her hand reached out, long fingers coiling around his bicep. “How long do you have?” she asked, the dark line of her brow arching. 

“Until the end of the w-week.” 

And with that, she smiled. “You’ve got plenty of time, baby. You’re the best mechanic in town - you’ll figure it out.”

“But w-what if I’m not the b-best mechanic in town?” he suddenly snapped - and if his flinch was any sign, a little harder than he meant to. Kat wasn’t so much as phased, though.  She just smiled at him, that same lazy, easy smile, the one that had charmed his socks off from the start.

“Well, he doesn’t know that, now does he?” she asked. “And he can damn well wait, just like any other person can.” Vincis’ features crumpled a bit, looking from her to the car. 

“I…I j-just don’t w-want to be a s-screwup. N-not in my w-work and…and n-not w-with you,” he muttered, gaze shifting downwards - only to be pulled around when she took his chin, turning his face to her.

“Hey…Vincis, I don’t love you because of the parts of you that I like.”

Briefly, the red-head looked completely, utterly baffled, totally not understanding just what the hell that was supposed to mean.

The ex-prostitute clarified it for him: “I love you for the parts about you I don’t like.”",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_webuv,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/webuv/short_storyfiction_flawed_707_words/,

She read some of my old stuff and says if I tried again, now, as an adult, I'd have the potential to churn out some halfway decent stuff. I don't know though. My writing always comes back to me as muddled and cheesy, reeks of trying too hard. I thought maybe I could post a few samples and get a review. Be brutal, I need to know if I'm wasting my time. 
*Untitled Excerpt 1:* 
KRAKOW-WOOSH!
	I decided I would make myself jump from my cover and just have to hope for enough timing and luck to put a bullet into one of these crooks kneecaps. Another shot fired, and I couldn't move. Another shot fired and I couldn't have made myself move if there was a rat climbing into my asshole. A century passed by. Swear to Christ, a century. I took deep breath and promised the poor girl at the other end of the room I would jump out of cover at the end of a count to three.
You Shouldn't make promises you can't keep.
""One"" came easily enough.
You will die if you leave your cover. 
""Two"" I readied my six shooter. 
Just turn around and go home. Take a long hot shower and drink yourself to sleep. 
""Three."" 
I jumped out and threw my gun in front of my face, desperately looking for something to shoot at, but all I saw was a bright flash.
	POW! Right in front of me. Shirtless thug number 4, whitie, had jumped from cover and fired a shot right at me. Over me? Behind me? I felt hot. Swimming in sweat. My nose felt runny. All my face felt like it had just received the mother of all bee stings, except for my forehead, my forehead felt like it had gotten so hot and light it had floated away to the ceiling. I fled back to my cover behind the dumpster and tried to wipe away the snot onto my sleeve. But something was missing.
	KRAKOW-PUH-TINK 
	They had shot off my nose. I rushed my hand against my face again, discovering a searing pain over strange numbness. It felt like I had a heaping vagina where my nose had once been. Blood was pooling onto the floor. Blood was everywhere, I must've looked like something out of an eighties horror movie. Why was the blood so bright? Every time I'd seen blood before it'd been this shitty brownish red while I looked like I had poured a bucket of true bright red paint all over my face and clothes. And the floor. The blood just kept coming, and I wasn't sure if it was years on the police force or just common sense that I was going to pass out. Take a pleasant little blood-loss nap to the lullaby of gunfire. The gunfire. The gunfire had stopped.
	""Zee, joo got him?"" The deep voice called out. 
	What kind of fucking name is Zee? Officer John Schmidt, murdered by a white wanna be nigger who goes by the name of 'Zee'. Some fucking name for the guy who kills me.   
	""Shit yeah, right in the fuggin' face!"" Zee replied. 
	""She-it, you see 'em?""
	""Naw, he fell back behind the dumpster.""
	""Well then getcha ass over there and make sure the nigga's dead.""

*Excerpt From Brown Baggers:*  	It was funny that we were the only employees who were brown baggers. Everybody else in the facility spent their lunch hour in the long food court lines, buying the government provided foodstuffs with their meal plans and crumpled wads of cash. They ate French fries on red trays. Greasy pizzas. Sloppy excuses for hamburgers. There was A salad bar, a soda fountain and even a soft serve machine. But none of it was for me and Richard. 
	Me and him -sorry- him and I sat in the back right corner, in the shadows. Near our corner table there was an empty table, a table where one lonely, obese security guard ate chicken nuggets with onion rings (everyday, mind you) and finally a table where small gaggle of blonde secretaries howled youthful giggles and gossiped their lunch hour away. They never brown bagged it either. Always had meal shakes and salads. Always complaining. Always. Complaining about their boyfriends, about the food they ate, about the suits they shredded, ran coffee runs for and blew regularly.  
	The Suits. Of course none of the suits ate in the cafeteria, they ate elsewhere in the facility, some hidden room. Begged the question if any of them ever brown bagged it.  Probably not. 
	Today, on this glorious monday, the 56th monday of the 70 mondays I was to work this year, my lovely wife had packed me a ham sandwich. Wheat bread, mozzarella cheese, a small layer of spinach leaves. I hate spinach. A bag of reduced calorie cheetos. There was a jello packet. A napkin, a plastic spoon, a small sticky note reminding me that she loves me. I really do hate spinach, wish she'd tell me she loved me by conveniently forgetting to put that on my god damn sandwich. 
	Richard slumped his pumpkin shaped body into the seat next to me without saying a word. I bit down into my sandwich instead of saying hello. We exchanged a sort of greeting with bobbing heads. He dropped a brown onto the table in front of him and opened it like one would a letter they'd been dreading to receive. 
 	An apple. A napkin. A can of coke. A packet of oreos. And a small plastic bag of cold pizza. Missing was a note reminding him he was loved. 
	""Cold pizza."" Richard mumbled, ""Swear to god it makes me wanna smack my kids every time they don't finish the entire pie.""
	I laughed. Not because it was funny, but because I had to let him know I was listening. 
	Richard coughed as he opened his warm coke, he began to slide the beverage through his persistent scowl and down his raspy lungs. A table over a blonde secretary howled with laughter.
	""How was it this morning?"" I asked, ""Peterson give you much trouble?"" 
	I wiped away some spinach on my lip. 
	""No."" Richard whispered. He took another chug of his coke before he began to tear open his Oreos.
	""There wasn't much fight left in him after everything you did to him."" Richard continued, playing with that first little cream cookie. 
	""What can I say? The victims parents wanted it rough. So I gave it to him rough."" I boasted, trying to retain some modesty.
	""What was that thing you did to the poor guys balls?"" Richard asked, unscrewing an Oreo and licking up the cream.
	""Twisted them. The mother's request. 'twist them 'til the sack pops, and then twist them s'more.' I think those were her words exactly.""
	Richard ate the rest of his Oreo and began to speak with his mouth full, ""You know, when you took this job, did you have any idea you'd be touching more balls than a common whore.""
	I laughed. Again, for the same reason. It was true though, what he said. Testicles had become a big part of my work week, day in and day out I was squeezing them, shocking them, cutting them and even, on occasion, burning them. Big hairy skin brains, and it was my responsibility to destroy them for Uncle Sam. Really isn't the ideal career I wanted to grow up to be. 
	""How was Peterson by the time he got to your office?"" I asked, only somewhat curious, I didn't really have much care for how the poor sap died.
	He returned with a question: ""Did you read my part of the request form?"" 
	""The rules state I'm not aloud to read your section of the request form.""
	""Company policy also says I'm supposed to wash my hands for a full minute before and after contact with blood, and when was the last time you followed that?""
	Richard had devoured his second Oreo and had begun struggling to eat the stone triangle of a pizza out of the limp plastic bag.
	""Tell me Richard, what was on your end of the request form.""
	""Nothing special. Just a drowning. Slow drowning. He was begging for it after everything you'd done to him.""

It is so hard to pin point what emotion exactly that I tie to it. They say that when it rains, it is actually God’s tears falling down from heaven: a remembrance of the destruction that fell down in the time of Noah and his great arc. His tears fall on the planet to wash away the sin, the pain, and the grievances of the past. Wash them away and bring about new life, a fresh start…  


But what have ‘they’ ever really known.  



I just like the rain is all: its sound; its energy; its beauty. And it’s smell…  



Again, I say with a slight chuckle, they say that it is a person’s sense of smell that has a way of triggering ones memory.  



‘They’ say a lot of things. But I guess if you say enough, you’re bound to be right one of those times.  



Thirty-six years of marriage… There was a lot of rain drops in those thirty-six years. Some of the happiest times in my life with him… and some of the darkest…  



Thirty-six years of roses.  
Thirty-six years of sunsets and sunrises.  
Thirty-six years of puddles and rainbows.  
Thirty-six years of lies, secrets, and affairs…  



It was raining so hard the first day we met. We were just kids then, it was so long ago. It was impossible to think that back then he’d change my life for as long as he did.  



I’ll never forget…  



Out of the blue one day he asked me in class to go to the park with him. He said with that stupid grin on his face, the one were his eyes smile just as wide as he does. We walked out, following the path. Awkwardly poking around at conversation, neither of us knowing quite what to say to the other. Neither of us was ever any good at small talk. He grabbed my hand, and nearly pulled my arm off as he shifted direction off the path. We stumbled through the brush and into a small clearing, a meadow. We just stood there staring at each other. Every time I tried to ask what he was doing or planning he just smiled and pressed his hand gently to my lips to get me to stop talking. Finally he let out a big sigh, leaned back and breathed deep through his nose. Seconds later the skies opened up and it just started pouring buckets. I shrieked and he just laughed that careless stupid chuckle of his…  



Years later, some stupid fight or another that we had, and I was storming out of his house. Stomping my feet hard in the mud of his dirt driveway. So furious and so angry that I didn’t even notice it was raining. So irate that those drops of water had to be turning into steam as they hit. I made it half way down the driveway before I turned around to see if that stupid jerk even cared. He stood there, just off his porch with his arms tilted back, face to the sky… Just letting the rain hit him in the face. Couldn’t tell anymore if there were tears in his eyes or just rain drops. Just stood there, face contorted as if someone had stabbed him, letting the rain try to just wash it all away. Damn fool was going to catch cold and get sick. But there was no way I was going to let him win. No way I was walking back to him, not this time… I was so sure of myself then and there… But I am a sucker for his smile…  



Our wedding day. I was so nervous, so worried. ‘They’ say that true love lasts forever, but, like I said, I never trusted ‘them’. What if it wasn’t true love? What if it was just him and me being stupid, and young… I was so worried, so full of doubts I never even made it to the church. He found me about 10 minutes after the wedding was spose to have started. I was just standing there, in my dress, in our meadow. He knew exactly where to look. Rain had already blown in from the south-east. ‘They’ say that’s bad luck on your wedding day… but what have ‘they’ ever known…  



Three years later, we were walking. He was going on and on about work. I was so sad but so happy at the same time. We’d turned into ‘that’ couple. Just existing in each other’s lives without really existing for each other anymore. But that was going to change… things were going to be so wonderful again… I reached over and grabbed his hand. I had to tell him. I stopped walking and nearly pulled his arm off to get him to take notice… It just started to rain and I finally spit it out. “I am pregnant.” Panic, fear, anger, confusion, and tears. His face changed so many different emotions and colors before he just smiled that big dopey smile of his. He tilted his head back and just screamed for joy and let the rain wash away his tears and his scared emotions. We were going to be a family…  



I slammed the door shut on the taxi. Told the driver to take me home, away from the hotel. He wouldn’t have to know. He wouldn’t ever find out about Patrick. Why would he need to know? I mean, he wouldn’t understand how it kills me each night to go home and sit by him in silence. He didn’t look at me anymore. We didn’t speak. Just awkwardly poked around at conversation. We were never good at small talk… I had to reassure the taxi driver that it was ok to let me out at the top of the road. Even he was worried about me being out this late in the middle of a storm… I just walked down our road to our driveway. Walked in the rain letting it wash the anger and heart ache from me. But I didn’t expect to see our porch light on. I didn’t expect to see him standing there holding our little Katie… My God what have we become…  



This was it, I said to myself. Screaming angry, violent… I threw the whole damn dresser drawer out the window. The bastard. That stupid bastard. Him and that stupid whore of his. Veronica! I spat as I said her name. The stupid bastard… He stood there shouting back up at the bedroom. Stood there in the rain… That damn bastard! His shirts and ties fell to the ground like confetti. It was so over… but, I am always a sucker for his smile…  



The wind picked up and sent the rain crashing into the hospital window. The doctor said it was cancer. Said it was terminal. This time, he said, it was time to say good bye. My God, I don’t wanna leave him… I held his hand. Told him it would be ok. I couldn’t stop crying. He laughed his stupid dopey laugh and said that wasn’t very reassuring. Tears streaming down his face and he smiled that stupid little smile of his. The one were even his eyes smile. “I love you.” He said. “I am so sorry…” I said. I just held his hand as he left…  



Thirty-six years of roses.  
Thirty-six years of sunsets and sunrises.  
Thirty-six years of puddles and rainbows.  
Thirty-six years of lies, secrets, and affairs…  
Thirty-six years of being together.  
Thirty-six years of love, hate, and everything in-between.  
Thirty-six years of family.

It made me cry in a way I rarely experience.  I apologize for its inevitable typos and poor quality.  I just had to share. 

Jaclyn, 
We were together for 8 magical years.  Three blessed years of marriage.  Every moment was amazing.  It had its ups and downs but no one in the world could doubt our love.    Nothing in the world matter besides you, then came that day.  August 12th  the day the world turned upside down.   A rainy day, warm and gentle on my face as I wheeled you in the hospital, the doctor took you from me and told me to wait in the lobby.  Four hours of pacing, four hours of never knowing what was coming next, no notice of progress or status.  Then the nurse came out and said, “Mr. MacRory, please come with me.”  I was brought to a hallway and shown a little girl in a pink cap and socks.  My daughter, Melody, smiling back at me, I had never felt such joy.  Then it all came crashing back.  I was told there were complications with the birth and that my wife, my wife who was my rock, had not survived the violent birth.  I was given a few minutes to say my good byes.  How could I express my loss or say what I wanted to.  How could I possibly say good bye to the woman who made very day brighter.  I cried and said how much I loved you, or how I could never go on living without you.  Two or three minutes I was given with her before I had to be removed from the room.   Two minutes and that was the last time I ever saw that soft delicate face.  I asked the nurse if you had seen your daughter before you left us.  She said you had and that your face beamed with pleasure at seeing your little girl cry, before your heart gave out.  I had to place you in the ground the same week that I had to care for our new and lovely daughter.   It was the ultimate perversion.  The joy in seeing my daughter, every moment with her is special, yet every time I saw her smile or see her eyes light up, I saw you, my wife who was not here to enjoy these moments.  I went to your grave every night for 3 months and stared at that piece of rock that was all I had left of you.  I struggled to keep a grip on my life for a bit, but I pulled through knowing you would have had I left you.  After all, I had a wonderful new daughter, who would need to grow up knowing what a magnificent woman her mother was.  Being a single dad was no picnic but I pulled through knowing there were others that counted on me.    I also knew what I saw your face again that you, always joking, would have something witty to say had I failed.   I wasn’t going to give you the satisfaction of being able to say you would have done better.  I was going to raise Melody to be as amazing and special as you were.  I had a picture of you by my bed and I would look at it every night and softly cry in bed missing you lying next to me.  I know you would always have something comforting to say to me.  I would grade my student’s papers and come across something amusing and I would stand up to go show you and forget that the house was quiet and that I had no one to show this to.  I started to get better day by day, time heals all wounds as they say.  It never takes away the scars.  I took Melody to figure skating classes knowing that you would have loved to see her doing her jumps and winning those trophies.  Not only did she have your smile and eyes, she had your brain thank god.  She succeeded in almost everything she tried.  I raised her with not only my ideals but I would always considered what you would say when an issue aroused.  I would always tell her stories about you and what an amazing person you were.  It is something I can never forget.  I miss you still after all these years, always stopping to look at a cat or a hummingbird knowing how much you would have smiled at those sights.  Melody got into high school with incredible grades, not only finding success at figure skating but also taking up my skills at bowling.  She won 3 gold medals in figure skating and made the varsity bowling team.  I even, against my better judgment, gave her my blessing when she started dating her dancing partner Kurt, knowing you would have.   She went to college and earned her doctorate in Pharmacology, something I know would have filled you with endless joy.  She got a job testing new medication for cancers.  Soon after she married her high school sweetheart like I did.  Our granddaughter was born July 16th, your birthday.  Melody named her after you.  I held baby Jaclyn in my arms and my eyes filled with tears instantly, joy at having a beautiful healthy granddaughter, and immense sadness knowing you weren’t there to share this moment with me.  

I lost you 33 years ago.  I never once took off my wedding band.  I lay here in my hospital bed knowing I will finally get to see you soon.  Melody is working around the clock trying to find something to slow the cancer eating at my body, but I know nothing can help.  I feel dread knowing how she will feel losing her father, or knowing I will never get to attend my granddaughter’s graduation.  I told her not to worry, but she has your stubbornness built deep inside her.  I looked at that picture of you every night before I went to bed and talked to you, told you about my day and what was troubling me, knowing you would have known the right thing to say every time.  I wish I had that picture with me now.  Looking at your beautiful face would always ease my fears.   Childish as it seems, I fear the end.  I always feared the unknown.  Tomorrow though I will be back in your arms a place that seems so far off and yet so familiar it seems like I last kissed you a few minutes ago.  I have, since our first moment together, loved you.  After losing you all those years ago, that love never ceased, and I will continue loving you into whatever awaits me.  ""After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure""  I will see you soon my love, we have so much to catch up on..

There was no wind; it was calm, tranquil and cool. I laughed, one short quick exhalation and the vapor cloud  hung in front of my face for a while before dissipating to a realm beyond sight and mind.    



I looked down at you. It had been about four years now, but you were exactly where I left you. The blades of grass had started to brown, marking the end of summer and soon the onslaught of winter would be upon us, bringing with it the cold devastation.    



It was had been four years now, and judging by the condition of this place, you had already been forgotten.    



I thought back to it all. The violence. The beauty. Your panicked breath washing over the skin on my neck, just below my ear. Normally I take no pleasure—well, that is a slight lie, but I deny myself from giving in completely to the fury of it all. The dance, while still skillfully executed, typically contains no emotion. I could make rivers and lakes with what I have done, so what is just one more bucket?    



Sure the first time engulfed me. It fueled my desires. Eviscerated with every last second of the moment. It happened all so fast, but time distorts in my mind. It is slowed to the point of seeing a hummingbird's wings flap with a slow and steady pulse. I heard the echos of a heart beat, loud and thunderous, irregular and desperate...    



And with you it wasn't any different—though thousands of times this ritual plotted, schemed, and preformed, I heard the echo of your heartbeat. Time was not in control, I was. You had surrendered completely, accepting your role entirely. You had your part to play, though you tried to rob me of it. Foolish, but still what more could have been expected of you? So fiery, so stubborn, and so sad. But oh so beautiful. Your cries still ring in my ears. I can still taste your sweat on my tongue, and the acrid scent in my nostrils. I don't have to imagine it, no. No no no; not you, my dear. And that is what makes you special. That is what mark you have left. That, and the scar from the bite mark on my shoulder.    



I watched as your eyes glassed. I stayed to watch you paint the floor. Each and every last brush stroke, divine—sacrosanct. Plotted so precise by the hand of fate. And when it licked my boot, I watched it change—as beautiful as the leaves in autumn.    



Ah yes. Autumn.    



It had been four years now. And you were exactly where I left you.    



The cold air made every sound within a mile crystal clear—clear as the sky on this day. The sun was starting so set now, and the once cool and tranquil calm—the eery stillness was replaced by a gentle breeze. The rustle of dead leaves interrupted the pin-drop-silence I so enjoyed. But as the leaves blew between the gravestones, they were caught and coalesced among the trinkets of those left behind...    



There were no flowers.
There were no candles.
There were no wreaths or bells.    



You were exactly where I left you. And it had only been four years, but the world has already forgotten you.    



You had no mourners.
You had no survivors.
You have only me.    



Me...    



And it is only a matter of time before I move on. Till my life is once again chained to the ritual, the dance. Your screams will be replaced from my dreams. The blood on my hands will belong to someone else. And then what will become of you? How long till your name fades from the garnet? Your life was a short and pointless echo, muted at my hand. Erased, as if you never existed.    



There were no flowers at your grave.
There were no candles.
There were no wreaths or bells.
There were no letters from loved ones.
There were no tears that frosted the browning grass.
You had no mourners.
You had no survivors.
You had only me.    



I reached into the pocket of my long coat.
This was my paint brush. This was my pen. This was the baton I used to conduct your requiem.    



I set the silver plated, serrated and barbed dagger at the foot of your headstone. A single red velvet ribbon tied into a perfect bow embraced the blade to the hilt.    



I blew a kiss and walked away.    ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1338642169.0,,,True,t3_ug6oy,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ug6oy/prey/,

Charlie was at cash today. It was an 8 hour shift and he was doing his best. The cool wind flowed through his poor hair, and the suns warmth caught his skin. It was a beautiful day today and it was unfortunate he had to be cashing away people he didn't know. It wasn't so crowded now, so Charlie got a sense of relaxation. It didn't last long, for his eyes gazed at a girl now coming towards him. She was young, and wore glasses much bigger than they needed to be. Her nose was a bit long and as she spoke she had the accent of a far away country. Romania perhaps.

“Hi."" she said as she placed her flowers before him so he could scan. Charlie did as he was supposed to do, making sure he kept his smile. “Ello."" Charlie answered, with much energy. Deep down he felt compelled and memory-stricken from the fact that this young girl looked much liked his ex. So much for moving on. The girl smiled at him and when things were done, she left. 

And that was that.

When the long day was done, and after he left work without a sound, he walked to the bus stop. Blissful tunes he had made bopped in his ears, and meaningful melodies inspired him to keep moving. He was content, that above everything else, he was talented. The night sky was indeed beautiful, and him being alone was well enjoyed. He hummed and sang imaginary lyrics and notes and he laughed as it amused his musical soul. The stars above him made him smile and the wind was cool.

The bus ride however was not so much fun as he had liked it to be. 

Teenagers  younger then him had boarded the bus and Charlie had no choice but to be around then and their activities. Holding hands and shit like that. You know the deal. 

Charlie knew it all to well, and deep down he hated them. Today was a day of many reminders of how out dated he was, how anti-social he seemed to be, or how he still lived on lies and lost love. But he couldn't complain. 

All he had to do...
was close his eyes.

Barking. 

Constant barking. 

Charlie rested alone on his bed, over hearing the howls and barks of his dog upstairs in wanting of his beloved owner to come home. That being Charlie's sister of course. The dog was getting old, and Charlie only wished what was on his dogs mind as he barked and howled.

Charlie felt work already taking a toll on him. It wasn't much hours yet but he was getting a bit tired indeed. Music became a ringing buzz in his left ear. The ambience of the room was quiet. Imaginary ciggarete fumes escaped Charlie's lips. His eyes searched for meaning in this room of his. As he exhaled, he closed his eyes and tried to sleep. Because well, there was nothing much to do. Loneliness was a word over used, and a feeling much grasped to him. It was loneliness that bound his last minutes tonight.

His brain melted.  He pictured himself working towards something he cared about in a place where he was happy.  The vision evaporated as his current surroundings interrupted.  He was lying on the couch in his mother's house watching Law &amp; Order at 4am.  The sound was muted (he wanted to smash the TV once he realized he'd been watching commercials without thinking) and his mother was asleep in the next room.  For a brief moment, sleep tugged at his eyelids.  Shrugging it off he did some quick math and calculated he'd only been awake for eleven hours.  Executive producer: Dick Wolf.  He wondered how old this Dick Wolf guy was by now.  He wondered how they got the early 90's episodes into high-definition.  Did they keep the original cuts on film?  Another commercial.  Another few minutes of thought.  He stared at his feet.  Suddenly the silence was broken by all the sounds he'd been tuning out.  The fan running in his mom's room, crickets, the external hard drive by the TV clicking away.  He found himself appreciating the free time, though not without a peppering of guilt.  For the last five years he'd been complaining how little time he had to do what he wanted.  Moving back to his hometown was supposed to be a distraction-free zone for him to get some serious work done.  It was, in fact, so distraction-free that he found himself creating distractions to break up the monotony.  An online dating site.  His old purple Gameboy.  He was on the verge of deleting his dating profile—after one lukewarm date and no replies from the few girls he thought pretty, his curiosity and excitement had faded and a slight feeling of embarrassment and rejection started creeping.  He knew he was no Warren Beatty-circa-1967 but no Warren Beatty-circa-now either.  He knew if he could talk to a girl in person he could be charming and funny.  In the world of online dating your face is really your password.  Get it wrong, and the game's over before it starts.  To hell with that.  As far as the Gameboy, he'd gotten halfway through Pokemon Silver and couldn't justify putting in another 40 hours.  Not right now.

The show was back on.  Another episode was starting.  He unmuted it.  CHUNG CHUNG.

Sometime well after sunrise, he was lying in bed with every intention of going to sleep.  The light coming in between the slats in the blinds was dealt with by putting a pillow vertically against them.  It was always in these moments that his brain would shift into overdrive, compelling him to reach for his smartphone every few minutes to check a fact or satisfy a new curiosity or unanswered question.  Tonight he was wondering how glue worked.  He was surprised he'd never thought about it before.  He came up with a theory on his own, and was then pleased as it lined up fairly well with what Cecil Adams had to say.  He pictured the surfaces of everything as being as jagged as a craggy mountain range at a molecular level, no matter how smooth they appeared.  And that the glue must somehow, while it's still liquid, find its way into the crevices and then harden.  It would be the same principle as sticking your hand into a pile of hay and grabbing a fistful.  It was too late to try analogizing Van der Waal's forces.  He fell asleep.

He seemed, lost, confused, demented beyond repair. Surrounded by a shroud of emptiness, his whole world had been shattered, everything he knew consumed by the vile darkness that had somehow found its way to his planet.

He didn't know how long ago it had happened, the destruction of his world. It felt like mere moments ago in his mind, but the few pieces of sanity remaining within him reminded him that it could have been years for all he knew. With his sense of purpose gone, so was his sense of time.

The images were fresh in his mind, reliving the devastation time and time again. The thick darkness that over shadowed the world, a darkness so deep that even the 2 suns revolving around the planet could pierce. And from the darkness, the creatures that had descended upon them....fierce, mindless, fearless, countless hordes of vile abominations destroying anything in sight.

One such creature happened upon the mans family. The man, while powerful, was no match for the dark. The last image that his sanity allows him is fending off the creature....then a darkness, the taste of blood in his mouth....the cries of panic and dismembering of his family from the fiendish monster.

And the blood...everywhere blood....the screams....and then nothing.....

He then awoke in the strange place on his world that he wanders to this day and has wandered ever since that day. Where everything that he held dear....his meaning, his purpose was decimated by the nothingness.

Everyday was the same to him. He had not felt the mortal desires in the years or days or minutes it had been since that first day. He had not felt hunger, nor thirst or anything else resembling humanity. Nothing allowed him the peace of death, although something inside him seemed to tell him that on his world, there would be no peace in death.

Nor, oddly enough, he had not felt the pangs of loss that most people would have associated with losing absolutely everything. The man, wandering hopelessly, had no where to go, and had no idea why he was going there. Everyday was the same to him.

Everyday was the same, he felt nothing...everyday...save for today.

This day, unknown minutes, seconds, moments later, pain beset the man. Today, he felt as if he had not eaten in years, his stomach ached for nourishment, his throat felt dry and gasped for relief. His legs, after regaining feeling, could not carry the man through his wanderings any longer, gave way, causing the man to fall to the earth. Worst yet, as if to ail him further, his soul began to weigh him down, and he felt the cries and pain of an entire world besiege his being, as if the pain of the world cried from within him. His body filled with remorse for the untold millions of deaths that he felt, as non existent tears filled his eyes. His body could not produce any. His heart mourned for the souls lost within the dark purgatory that destroyed his home.

""I can make all your pain go away, mortal. Wash your desires and pain away, with but a nod of your head and your request, the anguish will be purged from your body....""


Startled by the forbodeing* voice, the mand tried to life his grief stricken head to confirm its source, but could not. Instead, he tried to ask with a dry mouth "" Who...who is....this? What is....happening?"" But nothing came to from his efforts.

""Think of me as your savior, the only one that can save you from the endless years of torment, knowing no peace without me, and knowing no light with me....""

The man barely understood what the voice was saying, other than that he wanted, no, needed, the pain to subside, and it seemed this was his only way out. To stop the pain, stop the greiving, stop feeling again....

And so, our champion tiredly lifted his head, looked dejectedly into the darkness surronding him, not at all realizing he no longer seemed to be on his own broken world, but instead what seemed to be nothingness. The man quietly whispered with heavy heart, his body beaten and broken "" Take...the pain...away... I beg of y-you....""

He could feel the darkness pulse with a sense of satisfaction at his response while he waited for what would happen next. The man felt a dark hand reach deep within himself that started to pick away at his soul..... stripping away his memories, feeling them being plucked from his mind one at a time. His friends...his family...his children....everything, being purged from his mind, quite painfuly. He felt his very being being taken from his body, making him less and less human every second that went by since his response.

At the same time, during this painful transition, he felt a sense of reliefe, serinity of you will, of the greif being lifted up and out of his body, the cries of the millions being deafend just an iota at a time...his desire for food, sleep, water also being removed from his body. After who knows how long, the man allowed a brief smile to spread across his face....

...only for that smile to curl into a scowl of disatisfaction at the burning sensation began filling his body. His veins seemed to fill with knives flowing through his blood stream, cuting everything vein and nerve along the way. What felt like liquid fire filled his mind as it purged the final pieces of his memories from his being. He felt as if he could rip is own flesh off from his body just to relieve the pressure.

But no such relief came to the man. His mouth felt a thirst ten times than that felt mere seconds ago, his hunger grew in such a manner that he felt as if his stomach would eat its way out of him just to fill itself.

And even if that wasn't enough for the pain stricken man. He felt and grief and sorrow of the millions of deaths of his home decend upon him, as if all the creatures of this world were somehow bound to him and were slowly, just as his memory was, being ripped from his body one by one, each one more painful than the last.

As the pain worsened, silent screams of anguish began to escape his lips, the dark essence coursing throughout him, rapeing him from within of his humanity. A grim realization came over the man as he had realized what he had done.

The tranistion, or, mutation rather, reached a painful climax, tearing into the man like a tempest of a thousand hells, ripping his soul asunder, pulling his flesh from his bones. As the final portion of the transformation began, the man was allowed to see who he had aggreed to save save him, and upon gazing into the darkness at the face of the purgatory he was in, the man was filled with utter horror.

""There is no turning back now my child....you are now apart of my darkness. My. Nothing.""

And with that, a final surge of dark essence filled the man with a burning, emptyness greater than all the rest. With his final ounce of humanity, the man bellowed forth a blood letting scream, to the fill the ears of no one....and as the scream echoed through the darkness and faded away, the broken and beaten world was left in silence, devoid of all life, with no one left to wander its wastelands any longer......",,False,,t5_2qhmi,True,,,True,t3_swbzg,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/swbzg/end_of_a_life/,

Kinda long, but I think it's worth it. Have fun :)

Mr. Joseph’s Suit

Thomas Joseph lived in a small farming town. He knew all of his neighbors and half of them were his relatives. He lived in a house that was surrounded by trees and had an old wood barn in the back. He didn’t have the biggest house in the town and hardly anyone paid attention to him and the property he inherited from his long passed relatives.

Thomas went into town and bought paint to paint his house. He thought that if there was a change to the way it looked, attention would be drawn to him and how great it looked. He might event get questions like “Wow, I love the new color of your house!” or “I can’t imagine the hard work you’ve put into it”. If people recognized him then everyone would like him. Thomas not only bought paint for his house, but also for his shed in the back. He painted them both yellow because he couldn’t think of a color that would attract more attention than something as bright and glamorous.

Thomas spent many days painting his house. He didn’t ask for any help from his friends and neighbors because he thought that if he got it done all by himself then it would make it look like he worked harder on it, and did a better job. 

In truth, the paint he gave his house attracted no attention whatsoever. Thomas went through the town, talking to all the people he saw. He made small talk, expecting someone to comment on his house without him telling them. When he finally got annoyed with the lack of responses, he said “I got a new color on my house. Did you see it yet?” However, no one really cared about his house. They didn’t even know he painted it or that anything new had even happened to it.

When Mr. Joseph got home, he tapped his foot with annoyance. He sat in his chair with the smell of paint fumes still floating around in the air, reminding him of his unsuccessful campaign for attention. He would have to try harder to get the results he was looking for.
That same evening, Mr. Joseph went down to the local tailor to get a suit fitted for him. Changing something about his appearance would make the townspeople think highly of him. He bought the fanciest suit he could afford, and it was all white; more noticeable for the eyes. He picked out new cuff links from the jewelry store that were made out of mother of pearl. When the tailor measured his arms and legs for fitting and told him it would be ready to pick up the next Wednesday.

When he returned to his house, he had buzzing thoughts floating around in his head about how popular the suit would make him. Would the tailor tell people about it? Perhaps they too would have a growing anticipation to see Mr. Joseph in his new white suit. He forgot to tell the tailor how many buttons to put on it, and what kind. If she put black buttons on his white suit, the effect would be diminished. If the tailor didn’t measure him correctly, the suit could be ruined and it would make him look trashy if it didn’t fit. 
Throughout the week, as Mr. Joseph feared, no one questioned him about his visit to the Tailor. There wasn’t a word said about his new suit, except for the Tailor sending him a letter asking about how the pockets should be. Mr. Joseph was still upset but he was willing to wait. 

When Wednesday came, Mr. Joseph dressed into his brand new suit and strutted around town. He wore his mother of pearl cuff links. All his buttons were shiny and white. The suit itself fit perfectly, but no one saw him. It was getting to be dark so not very many people were out at that time of day. Sadly, Mr. Joseph returned home. 

But he wasn’t done yet. He had one thing in mind that would get him the attention of all of his friends and neighbors. 

Mr. Joseph went into the barn, still wearing his suit, and set fire to all the things that would burn. The old hay ignited in almost an instant and flames were licking up the walls. A giant plume of smoke went into the air, and sure enough, neighbors started coming. His ego burned with anticipation. 
Cars lined up all the way down the street of people who were curious about what was happening and willing to help. They saw Mr. Joseph in his new suit and the new paint on his house, but they also saw the blazing fire that was spreading to the trees that surrounded his house.

There was not much they could do to save his house. After the trees around his house caught fire, the flames engulfed his home. The townspeople could do no help, because buckets of water could not put out a fire as big as Mr. Joseph’s. The only thing Mr. Joseph had left was himself and his fancy suit, and that did not make the townspeople think highly of him. 

TL;DR: Guy wants to impress everyone with his new suit. Ends up catching his house on fire.

This is rough, but if I have the potential to get better, please let me know! 


Today I was awoken from my dreamless sleep by the cry of my child. This is not unordinary as he is an infant. He cried for a minute, maybe less. As I struggled to gain consciousness from my deep sleep. 
The time on the clock flashed 9:48am. Without fail every morning, he will cry. I sludge into his room next door, the ribbon tied to his door knob lay straight. Silent. I turn the knob, just an inch. No more than that to glance a peek. ""It's a gift to see your child when they are unaware of you."" I say absently to myself.
There he is. Eyes wide with wonder for what is to come of today. Sleepy eyes, yet wide and brown. His head casually turns left in my direction, blinking, then right. He whimpers. 
""is he whimpering for breakfast? For more sleep? Possibly he just wants out of his crib to play and investigate all his toys spread across his room?"" I ponder. 
The floor creaks at where I stand. I step back to hide my face through the small crack in the door. The perfectly round head peaking over his crib and big brown eyes snap in my direction. Its too late. He saw me. A loud whine escapes his small soft lips. A cry for his mama. 
""He wants me? Before his breakfast? Before his toys?"" My heart floods with love. I make my way slowly toward his crib, smiling. My arms stretched out, I reach for my boy. His arms stretch just as far as they can go to reach mine and his cheeks turn rosy. His eyes no longer seem tired. His lips no longer whimper cries. He smiles.

1329603585.0,4,self.shortstories,pvpkj,The Affair,sbryce,5,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/pvpkj/the_affair/,"I met Kaylee at a party. She was standing in the back, trying to hide from all the excitement around her, but I still saw her. Casually I walked up to her, speaking the small and insignificant chatter people spout at parties like these.  She laughed at my jokes and I smiled when she pointed out my worn out dress clothes.  It was an couple hours before I found out she was married.  I went to grab us drinks and I returned to find her standing with another man who introduced himself as her husband.  My heart sank in my chest as he finished his sentence and my shock must have been clearly displayed upon my face.  Looking at Kaylee, she didn’t look ashamed or embarrassed as if I should have somehow known this from the beginning.  I smile and told him it’s nice to meet him and it was nice talking to his wife, but I really must be going.  Setting down the drinks at the nearest table, I walked out of the party a rejected man.

The next few weeks I seemed to see Kaylee everywhere.  I wasn’t sure if this was new or she had always been there and I had simply started looking for her.  I got good at coming up with excuses to talk to her, insisting it would be horrible for both of us to eat alone or just offering to buy her a drink.  It was enough to get me in her life and eventually we exchanged phone numbers after deciding we must make a point to hang out.

At first, she would only allow us to be together while in the company of her friends.  It made me smile at the thought of needing a chaperone to keep us from misbehaving.  Given time, we got to be alone after she convinced her husband I was “just a friend”.  I wonder if she really believed that was true.  I made a point to never allow her to view me as such, always telling her she was gorgeous and how sexy she looked in her new coat.  If it was a lie she told, it had her husband convinced and that was all we needed.

She would come over to watch movies at my place. She would sit next to me on my couch, far enough away to give distance, but close enough to tempt me to move closer. We would switch off picking the film, she would always pick one of her favorite movies and watch me as I watched the screen, checking to see if I enjoyed it as much as she did.  I always played my part well, insisting it was one of my favorite movies and telling her the lead actor was born to play that role. On my nights, I always picked romantic films hoping to trigger some thought or feeling about me she might have been ignoring.  When the credits rolled, I’d ask her how she liked it and she insisted it was very good. Perhaps we were both doing the same dance.

This went on for weeks before I decided alcohol would go much better with the movies than popcorn.  I poured her a glass and we turned on my movie, but this time we didn’t watch it.  We talked.  It was small things at first, but after a few drinks she finally admitted she had feelings for me.  I smiled, feeling all the doubt about her I had wash away, and I told Kaylee I liked her too.  As she smiled, I moved close giving her a kiss. She hesitated for a moment then kissed me back.  After weeks, the tension between us was broken and the single kiss turned into passion.

Holding her close I slowly stripped away her clothes, always watching her carefully for signs that she would change her mind, that the fairytale would end and she would disappear from my arms. I lied her down on that couch, which for weeks we sat silently thinking about this very moment.  She moaned and squirmed like a virgin, but surely a married woman couldn’t be.  Perhaps she had never really been satisfied.  Despite my excitement and anticipation, I took my time, absorbing every moment knowing it could be the only time she would be mine.  I held her close, kissing her neck, feeling her gentle breaths and quiet moans, causing my excitement to peak.

We found ourselves in my bed.  Never bothering to put our clothes back on, we felt no shame.  I lie there gently running my hand through her hair as she slept, thinking about all the time and effort that went into that moment.  How unlikely it is for her to be laying next to me.  It was bliss.  Momentarily bliss.

The next morning I wake to her putting her shoes on and I knew our night together was finally over.  I tried to think of words that would keep her from leaving, but nothing came.  She walked out the door and I knew she was going back to him, to her husband, and I would lay there thinking how helpless in love I am…with a married woman.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_pvpkj,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/pvpkj/the_affair/,

“I remember one day of winter,” my grandfather looked mistily out the twelve inch synthesized window. He’s one of the few in our colony that knows of winter first hand. I have brought him to the observation point on the western end of The Dome at his request. This is his response to my request to tell us of how life felt in the days before artificial air and extreme heats of the wastelands. “The wind whisked down my neighborhood just as I stepped out into the white blanket on my porch. A chill ran up my legs but I hardly noticed, my friends were already playing across the street. Hmpff, I couldn’t have been taller than I am now.” He looks to me with a smile. “We spent the entire day by the hill behind Wilson’s house. We took sleds and lids down that hill, trying to guide it down to an alley so we could go the farthest. We didn’t stop till we saw a couple girls from school cutting through the alley. Linda Mould and Susan P. Cole,” He turns to me with a special grin. Susan P. Cole was my grandmother.

“I jumped line when I saw them, knew it was a special one the second I started. The boys whopped and hollered behind me, they knew it too. Susan and Linda had to leap from my way just as I flew by and crashed right into the Ralman’s garbage cans. Didn’t think about how I’d stop, never do at that age. No one did in those days.” Something in his voice changes. The mist in his eyes is more of a water haze now, he points to the empty horizon. “I use to see homes, grass, animals, and clouds. I never new that hope for the future was artificial till the mechanics of the world were stripped from us. It didn’t matter what we did to try and stop it neither.” I can see him slipping into more painful memories so I request him to point out when exactly he noticed the world changing first hand. 

“Changes? Well them happen often and often.” (He means to say changes happen a great deal and always.) “Well, the first time I realized the talk was true was I woke up in some pain, not a good deal, but enough to shake you to. Round the time I was leaving college I suppose. I looked around my bed for whoever woke me, Susan hadn’t been over that night so I couldn’t figure out who’d hurt my arm. It was near midday and I had spent the better half of the morning sleeping off the night before. I wanted to sleep some more but the sun was slipping between my blinds and onto the side of my bed. I got up to close the drapes, but first to peak outside. I was looking for anyone of note when I noticed warmth and a near instant sting all over my face. I leapt back and closed the drapes. I felt relief right away. I knew it, right then, I knew it. The sun was burning like they said it was, hot and fast. My first thought was to call Susan and see if she was feeling it too.”

It’s not long after that our history lessons pick up, reminding those of us who weren’t yet here that the earth was becoming barren. My grandfather was one the first selected to one of the science division domes. The structures we all have been raised were in fact substitutes for an atmosphere we never knew, so we could have a life we never could have hoped for. “I broke through as a design engineer. Interning for the great Doctor Kepling. Now that man could work, spend entire months ruining chalk boards and burrowing floors with his pacing. I nearly didn’t sleep in my time there trying to keep up with him and the three kids at home. No one really knows his name anymore, yet his design saved what’s left of us.” His sigh holds a lot of weight out of his chest. I decide its time to broche a subject that has been refrained from in my family for years now. 

I ask him as gently as possible, what happened in the evacuation. There is a long pause and silence before he can gather the breath to speak. The gruffness I had grown up knowing is back, he is the old man in the recliner I know again. “We…We only got the news of The Flare just as it started. I was at home sleeping in as I had the day off and Susan…Susan should have been shopping. The phone call came and the doctor himself was frazzled. I could tell before he said anything it was happening. I was to stunned to really hear him after that, he said he just wanted to make sure I made it and hung up. I forced myself out of bed and put these packs of necessities and valuables we had made in case it did come. I heard the kids downstairs playing, I yelled for them to get up and get there stuff ready. They knew what I meant but I don’t think they truly new what it meant.” My father swears it was all too quick to remember. One day your breathing humid air, the next day it’s artificial. Kids his age hardly caught on to the significance of things as they went.

“Once we were all packed I rushed the kids out to the car. It was so bright out I could hardly see my way to the car, still I had to find Susan. I had lugged her bag to car with mine. I was going to drive strait to the market to find her. I’ve sweat often before and since then, but I doubt any compared to that day. We got there and I can remember my sprint to the door seeming to last far to long to be a couple dozen feet. I burst through the door and screamed for her, Susan! Susan!” His outcry catches me off guard, “I ran back and forth through the aisles still she is not there. I looked to my watch, If I was to save my children I couldn’t wait any longer. I’d have to hope she received the message and caught the follow up busses to one of the others. 

When I returned to car and began to head for my designated dome, it was clear the word was out. People we rushing all about in a frenzy. I don’t ever think I’ve seen such horror on so many men and women’s faces as on that day. I told the kids to duck down so they wouldn’t see. I speed out from our town into the dessert sands towards the dome. I think I was one of the last through, they closed those giant glass doors a little after we passed through.” After this he holds his head in his hands in silent hiding of his face. My Aunt recalls him braking down and crying over the wheel till some nice man came to get them from the back seat. They didn’t see him again for a week. My grandmother was never found, nor has our family ever discussed her final whereabouts. 

From there the rest of the word documents well our methods to survival. Two generations of struggle-less survival, made us able to be complacent again. We should stay vigilant in pursuit of the solution; we should never allow ourselves to simply survive, but also to live. Even if it is only our grandchildren who will truly be unscathed. Never may we forget what great human loss we suffered in the Scorching.

1326678686.0,4,self.shortstories,oiof3,A dream that I had.,Hxtra,5,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/oiof3/a_dream_that_i_had/,"I don’t remember how I got there or where it started. So, in a way, it started off like most dreams do. I was running. But not in solidarity; with a group. I wasn’t exactly sure who they were, I just felt a deep camaraderie with them as if they were close to me. It’s hard to explain. None the less, we trekked on. The barren, gray landscape made me feel empty and thirsty inside, like I knew something better than this was out there somewhere. Or was it somewhere in the past? Was this the aftermath of a dispute between our territory’s leader with another? Regardless, I knew that there was something better than this. It was eating at me.

We ran for what seemed like hours, passing abandoned houses, ransacked for their valuables. Finally, we stopped in a small neighborhood. Three houses stood there seemingly untouched by the madness of what the earth was now. It was a comforting feeling to be back home. We set down our valuables and watched the sun slowly make its dissent over the orange horizon. We felt closer than we ever have before to each other. Quickly afterwards, we all wished each other good night. I lied in my bed wishing for this to be over. Whatever “this” was, I don’t know. 

The next morning, I awoke with a kick of my own leg. This seems to happen every time I die in a dream.

The rest of my group awoke, and we packed up again. This time though, we carried only the necessities as if we would come back. Maybe I could call this place home again. It’s been so long since I could. I kept that from the others. I found it difficult to show much weakness to them. Not now. One must be callused and strong in these times. 

The morning sun was beautiful, it was the only thing that gave me hope, as we marched onward. We didn’t talk about the past much, but when we did, It was certainly a touchy subject. You can only joke and play around for so long before conversion turns serious. It’s what we needed to keep sane, none the less, as we walked on this abandoned interstate. The hours were long, but I felt as if we were coming up to something big..something worth our while. Just then, our leader, average in height with a weathered face and wrinkly brow, raised his binoculars that hung around his neck. He trembled as he said, “There! Over there! Something… miraculous!”. Every one of us immediately perked up at the thought and made a mad dash towards the undiscovered locale. 

We stopped and gazed in awe of what we saw, a large neighborhood of houses. What struck them as odd though was their toy-like appearance. The orange and green houses looked almost gelatin-like. Maybe they were? Relishing at the thought, I was the first one down the steep hill that separated me and this mysterious village, but before I could make it, a married couple from my group had already beaten me there and had sunken into the gelatin-made streets. It was the most peculiar thing we had all ever seen, but at the same instant, it was beautiful. We laughed, and we became children again. I didn’t look back or even think of the home that I left behind.

At that very moment, my leg kicked. I awoke in my bedroom; It was all a dream.

1326000526.0,6,self.shortstories,o7n2i,A sort of a dialogue that I wrote last summer,smintitule,6,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/o7n2i/a_sort_of_a_dialogue_that_i_wrote_last_summer/,"""Um...excuse me, but is something the matter?""  

Her voice sounded intelligent enough.  She was probably a student, just leaving the library after a long night of studying.  Spring term often causes even those with relatively easy courses to spend until eleven o'clock at night in the library.  Doing a four month course in two months' time can do that to a person.  

""Why do you ask?"" he replied.  

""You're lying on a concrete wall at eleven-thirty at night.""  

""I've seen people lying around here before.""  

""...in the daytime, maybe.  Never this late.""  

He paused for a second.  ""Well, I suppose you're right.""  

She studied him before replying.  He was in his early or mid twenties, and fairly well dressed, so he probably wasn't homeless.  Then again, he wasn't really sleeping on the wall; he was just lying there with his eyes open in his shorts, a button-up shirt, and sandals, at eleven-thirty on Saturday night.  

""So you understand, then, why I'm asking if something is the matter.""  
  
""I suppose so.""   

""...and?""  

""Have you ever had the feeling that you're different than everyone else?""  

""Well, obviously"" she replied.  ""Everyone's different.""  

""No, I'm not talking about normal, 'you listen to Mariah Carey and I listen to Sufjan Stevens' kind of different, I'm talking about really, completely different than everyone around you.""  He spoke as if he were having a sort of revelation on the spot--as if nothing that he was saying had ever occurred to him before that moment.  ""Like, as if your brain works differently in the way that it comes to conclusions, and your priorities are completely different than everyone else's.""  

She paused before replying ""Is that why you're lying on a concrete wall under a tree at eleven-thirty at night?  Because you're different?""  
""I suppose that's one reason,"" he finally admitted, ""and I think that's the root problem.  But probably not the biggest problem I'm facing right now.""  

""Why's that?""  

""Well, I don't necessarily think there's anything wrong with being different.  I mean, Da Vinci was probably different.  Not that I think I'm him.  Sometimes it can create problems, though.""  

""I meant for you to tell me what this supposed 'biggest problem' you're facing right now is.""  

""At this exact moment?"" he inquired.  

""At this exact moment"" she replied.  

""At this exact moment, my biggest problem is the fact that I'm trying to have an existential crisis, and there's this random girl talking to me.""  
""I'm sorry, I can leave, if you want.""  

""No, no.  I think it's better to talk about it than to lay here, thinking about it.""  

""Okay, so then talk.""  She sat down about a foot away from his head, there on the wall.  

""Well, for starters, I came to the realization today that I've never had a deep, meaningful relationship with anyone.  Ever.""  He spoke in a fairly monotone voice, but somehow it seemed as though he was just barely maintaining his grip on the present.  As if just thinking about the subject caused him inexpressible horror.  She saw the way he lay across the concrete, with as much of his body touching it as possible, and it seemed that he was rooted to the earth in such a way to compensate for his mind's desire to flee.  

""What do you mean by 'deep, meaningful relationship'?""  

""I mean...well, something that matters.  It's like I have all of these friends, right? And I talk with all of them, and I hang out with some of them, but at the end of the day, I can't really depend on any one of them.  They'd like me to think that I can, but I really can't, and when I need them they all seem to disappear.  It's like...I don't know, like everything is plastic.  Fake.  The world is a set of social rules that I have to follow in order to be normal, and because of this I can't have a real, deep, meaningful relationship with anyone.  Because it's not normal. At least, not on the level I'm thinking of, it isn't.""  

""Well, can't those relationships be a gateway to what you really want?""  
""You'd think so.  I did.  But I must always end up bending or breaking one of those social rules.  Or maybe I'm completely and unforgivably disobeying one that I don't even know about.  And because of that, these fake friendships tend to disintegrate, quickly.  Maybe 'plastic' wasn't a good word to use to describe it.  Plastic takes too long to disintegrate.  It's like they're made of paper, and the first time it rains everything gets soggy and unreadable, then just breaks apart, because there's no real substance to it.""  

""And that's why you're lying here?""  

""Yes.""  

""On a concrete wall.""  

""Yes.""   

""At eleven-thirty at night.""  

""Yes.""  

""Because you feel like your friendships are all disintegrating and there's nothing you can do to stop it.""  

""Yes.  Well---no.  Not exactly.  It's like, I just realized that they all have the capacity to disintegrate, with little to no warning.  And that's what freaks me out.  Not knowing.  Well, that and the lack of a real, meaningful relationship with another human being.""  

She paused for a moment, presumably attempting to compare this man's problems with her own, and arrived at a conclusion.  Haltingly, she scooted down the concrete wall another foot and a half or two, then lay down so that their bodies made a line, separated by six inches of space between the point where his head ended and hers began.  
""What are you doing?"" he asked.

her mouth danced anxious and rapid footfalls. Loud popping     
sounds were all over the news and Teresa would ask for caramel     
popcorn instead of tuna fish casserole. Daddy only turned off the     
TV and hushedly murmured in Mommy’s dark, buzzing hive of curls.    


        Teresa was a big girl. She decided to creep in the shadows     
to her big person closet to find her pajamas. Her footsteps echoed    
 in the house, a creak in every floorboard were her own red-handed    
 confessions lost to muted shadows. She could hear Mommy and      
Daddy arguing but trying to hush their lacerated tones. Teresa     
could hear words, only if she put her ears against her pink walls     
and held her breath, “…riots….it’s not safe…..when will we leave….passports”      
Teresa found her unicorn pajamas and struggled to put her tiny     
arms into the sleeves, getting her blonde curly hair stuck in the     
armhole.

sheets; her tiny heart afraid of red fingers to give her away,     
she trembled in infant fear. Pounding steps towards the door     
and louds voices. Teresa knew then that Mommy had     
remembered that Teresa needs big girl unicorns to sleep.   

 
        Mommy ran into Teresa’s room. Her locks a wild meadow     
over her face she whispers, “Teresa, hide!” So Teresa dives     
into the shadows of her bed as Mommy falls down when someone     
slams open the door behind her back. Teresa grabs onto the shaggy     
curls of her purple carpet. The mattress wires press against     
her back and her breath huffs. She sees Daddy fall onto the     
ground next to Mommy. Then a black hood slips over his face     
and he is pulled backwards, a snail in front of salt. Mommy     
whispers, “I love you” as her face disappears into the same     
black hood and she’s pulled away too. Mommy had forgotten

Each story can't take more than a night. This story was drawn from the theme, ""Let me think"".

===========================

When I was young, I moved. I moved like the ground was being pulled in front of me, and every frantic breath measured a stride. I ran. I lived in a sprint.

From outside Atlanta in the sweaty eves to shivering in the awnings at Gare L’est. I am 15, I am 19. A busker with uneven teeth smiles at me and I think she is the world. Jon, my best friend brushes me with his elbow.

-Not this one, he says.
-Rock, paper, scissors, I joke.

Wait, let me think. It was morning, and I am 43. The island sweats. The dog and I run in silence. The sun has risen and the land heats. We spring up the hill, panting and dizzy. Beyond us in the peninsula, the sea beating foam and white against the granite. I measure sides of granite sliding into the ocean in degrees. 37, 49. It was two years ago since we came here. 

-Come on, I say to him.

We cross the end of the of the road and navigate through the boulders and cacti along the path. As we descend, I feel the air thicken. Salt like nettles. Ahead, for some reason, the tide pool is a dark black. I slow, tie the dog to a branch and regard the gleaming layer. For some reason my reflection is nothing more than a dull figurine. The dog whimpers. I reach out with my hand.

And then I vanish.

I am 19, at a horrible electronic music show. The singer pulls a sheet over his body and shrieks into the microphone. I rattle off my list of four letter words and my friends rescue me. They drag me outside where it’s still light and dump me on a curb. I fumble for a cigarette that reaches my lips before I understand how. The light escapes me and suddenly I burn bright. A face, familiar and new acquiesces my premature death. I think I want to marry her and know instinctively that I will never see her again. She gives me a name that I forget and offers a hand. I reach forward.

And then I vanish.

Alexandra always regarded me with caution. We are at dinner. I am 28. I know our marriage won’t last I know she is gaining weight. I know my hair is starting to recede. I am not as fast as I used to be. I still stand straight, but my legs carry more than my frame. She and I once met as youngsters. She and I once fell in and out of love. Now in a different age, we have dinner, forget how we used to be and make vague promises. Land to spread out, air to breathe, a literary life. She turned me to Nabokov and Kinglsey Amis. She taught me that Russian beers are numbered to reflect your drunkenness. She excuses herself from the table, and suddenly the room changes. I see visions of myself stumbling in from every door. I am confused, because just one second ago I was here and I saw this. It lead me to that and now here I am. We shake, trying to clear out the fog. The poor bartender opens a few bottles and slides them down the bar. I am a set of ages and lifetimes. We amble, have the same taste in drinks, love the same songs.

But no, I am 15. Jeff has just run into the street. We’ve been drinking. His sister bought us beer and a couple friends came over. Tonight is sweltering. July, and the Georgia air that stinks of sweat and mosquitos.

We did shots of bad vodka, we swam and goaded the girls to remove their tops before hoping in the pool. The water was warm, and I felt floating through the chlorine and the floodlights that all my senses were deadened. I looked up to see the faint outline of clouds brushing past. Later we lit off fireworks. I remember my trunks still dripping and my feet caked in dirt. The bottle, fully loaded with munitions tips over. Meteors and cannonade stream past me. Jeff is 15 and so am I. He darts into the street hollering. I follow. Two bright stars explode. I pause to think. 

The universe tells us that all things are permitted, that in some incarnation I am 37 and swerving along a desert road. That give enough time, maybe not me, but a close approximation is staring down the sights of a rifle at a fine looking doe on a chill November morning. I am one ensemble in the sum of possibility and there are others around me, gathered by the void, we snack on tuna and crackers. We bask in the afternoon sun.

So imagine if you will this. I am in a room at the end of a long day, struggling through drinks, wary that I’ll fail to stomach dinner. Versions of myself meander about. Some grab snacks, others talk quietly. At first, it was such a shock. Even to hear one’s voice projected in a mass, but now after a couple passes, it seems second nature. I converse with myself, I am 45, 52, primes, divisions of 3, dead, mangled, born again.

The maitre d’ announces the first course. We precipitate towards tables, the same habit of crossing left over right and folding the napkin just. But I tarry behind. I think about the time in my youth, a feeling of warmth, sitting on a bed of pine needles. I’ve heard about a distant day from an old friend. About a walk under the Gothic arches of the place I so dearly called home. The creak in my knee is not yet come to pass. The knot in my wrist is only just now begun. I wince at the pinching of nerves and the grinding of joints and the momentary pain awakens me.

I feel as if I can’t breathe, trapped here in this dinner party. Bunel was insufferable enough without himself as a guest. Do you think they remember who it was that told that story? She had brown hair, and I could at least never forget her. I wonder if she would recognize my face now. I wonder if she would notice the difference when I step back into that room. Some things can never be made right. Some things can never be made whole. Many of the others have given up, but I believe the next time through I can get it right.

Around me. Like version of Judas, we conjure and we exist. We permute and arise, crowding an already suffocating room. We sin and we shuffle. God save us in our disgrace, our possibility.

1319244727.0,3,self.shortstories,lkk42,I wrote a very short story called Winter's Frost and am looking for feedback. Thanks! ,pangelboy,4,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/lkk42/i_wrote_a_very_short_story_called_winters_frost/,"Hi, I'm not really a writer. I wrote the below piece and just wanted to see what other people think of it. First reddit post, and I'm hoping it goes well. :) 

""It had been a particularly cold winter. The white frost blanketed the ground, killing everything that lived, as if Death himself laid down his tattered cloak over the land. I soon forgot what warmth was. The feeling itself frozen and shattered from my memory. There was only the cold left to keep us poor folk warm.

It was during that desolate winter that I had the pleasure of meeting Joe, a stoic man who had come from farther up North, seeking a warmth his body didn’t feel and his mind couldn’t remember. When I saw the crystal clear blue of his eyes, I remember thinking that the cold was in him, in those eyes, and he would never escape from it. But I was sillier back then.

I was young. A girl alone in the world, left to my own devices on a neglected and deserted ranch. Or at least what was left of it. I sometimes thought to myself I was Jonah, and the dilapidated house around me the dying carcass of that biblical whale. The “farmhouse” I lived in had been falling down around me for the better part of my stay, and showed no signs of slowing. I had found it like this and it had stayed like this, as broken and empty as I was.

Most people kept their distance, as I was seen as undesirable. Whether I thought myself worthy of such a distinction or not I did not care. I only cared that they thought I was worthy of distance. Peace of mind was something rarely afforded to most in this world, and as long as I was an unnamed presence meant to be quarantined from the normal folk I was afforded that peace of mind.

Until Joe. We met in the cold and it was the cold that sustained us until the frost became too bitter. He had been sleeping in “my” barn, or at least what was left of it. I rarely ventured out of the main house, as it was there I felt the most safe. I sometimes looked out at it from the kitchen window, mostly in passing, to check if it was still there, giving it’s sorry condition.

I watched through a spiderweb of cracked and stained glass as he went to and from the barn. I didn’t know where he went, but around dusk he would always stumble back to the shelter that the barn provided.

I had been alone for so long by then that his presence wasn’t easily articulated into clear feelings one way or the other. I knew he might be dangerous, but I also knew he was like me. A connection flowed from that kitchen window to the door of that barn. We were both a body without a soul. A life wasted, created in misery, and destined to die with a whimper not a bang. So I decided to speak to him, the first person in a long time I felt connected to on any kind of level worth a damn.

How he had been surviving in the barn for this long with it’s missing shingles and barely patched south wall, which had been through absolute hell during tornado season two years past, was a mystery to me. Everyday had found the weather turning colder as if the ranch was turning solid, and the barn wasn’t much protection. I didn’t know how to approach him without scaring him, as I had come to think of him as a solitary fellow, never having seen anyone in his company while he stayed on the ranch.

So I knocked. My knuckles meeting the frayed once-red, now pink, wood that covered the brown oak that made up the barn. The sound of my knocks were small, my shivering not only a result of the winter wind, but nevertheless he heard. Joe had been a man slow to talk when we first met, but he opened up as our talks grew.

It was around then that I began to realize his eyes were more the blue of the ocean water that I had sometimes dreamed about than frozen ice. We talked of many things, and when I told him of how I felt like Jonah, his laugh brought back something in me, and I laughed along with him. It was the shared laughs more than anything that kept me coming back to that barn for so long. 
He introduced a warmth that didn’t stretch very far but radiated with an unparalleled intensity between the two of us. We spent a month together on that cold farm, keeping the frost at bay. Eating when we could, sleeping, and most importantly living.

He and his watery eyes eventually moved on. But those days I kept with me for a very long time. I can still remember the bitter cold in my old bones, but I also remember the warmth that Joe and I rediscovered, that had been lost to us in the frigid world, until it to was killed off by the frost.""

1318881441.0,4,self.shortstories,lfgyx,The Protean Incident,CDanger,4,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/lfgyx/the_protean_incident/,"I don't want to read about a ""veneer"" and what's beneath it. I don't want to read about glass and wires and the new noir.

It's the way that you think of the concrete in an alleyway, the door that you look at with the blue light buzzing overhead in its wire-caged socket. I mean:

I hack away furiously at a keyboard, minding the sirens in the distance —and this time, for the first time, I'm sure that they're for me— and she bursts through the door and slips on the tile for a second, just catching herself. ""Shitshitshit! Come the fuck on! Come on!""

I jump up, barely catching up to the moment. Her coat is blown by strong gusts from outside. Then I see a blinding white spotlight stream through the doorframe into the room right in front of me, painting her into halves before I hear ""zeeowwhap! zeeowwhap!"" and she's too shocked to scream as she looks down at the torn fabric and dark spots, all the blood. She looks up at me. She won't make it, and as soon as I realize that, I feel like throwing up. But there's no time. I grab the memfile and I run through the narrow hallway towards the front of the place. There are already people shouting at the back entrance as I make my way onto the street. I slam the door behind me, as if that would somehow separate me from what's coming to get me.

As I run down the stairs, I lock eyes with a guy standing right next to my bike. He and I both know what's happening and he widens his stance and squares towards me, taking deliberate steps over the curb, past the parking meter. He's not pulling a gun; he wants me alive. That's even worse... I'm fighting panic, the urge to run. This guy is fucking moving on me. What am I doing? There, in the gutter next to the steps: the vodka bottle. I pick it up and rush him, and he seems to get what's going on, but he's pissed off, like he expected the confrontation to go a lot smoother, like me not surrendering doesn't fit into his schedule. But he doesn't feel what I feel, which is all the unused adrenaline from a docile life (a life that, undoubtably, is past and gone now) surging and spiraling through my veins like bobsleds made of electricity. And rage— rage because they killed her and I didn't even know what she was like, because now she can't be ""like"" anything anymore, because they want to kill me too and I don't want to be killed.

So it proceeds that, as he tries to reach for the bottle to grab it out of my hands, to go on with his plan of subduing me without becoming dead, I yell and swing as hard as I can. His eyes get big. I hit a home run. It's nothing like the movies, the bottle doesn't break. He doubles over and screams because his nose and part of his face are broken. Still yelling, I pull the bottle in an imaginary arc through the side of his head, like driving a golf ball— the sound is sort of the same too, ""WHOP-ping!"" except it's followed immediately by another scream and the guy is stumbling and falling onto the ground. He is about as angry as someone can get, reaching out desperately with one hand to hook my leg or something. I step back and dart to my bike, turn the key in the ignition. Come on. Thumb the start. Ok. Pull as hard on the throttle as I can. Shit. The other people are bursting out of the front door now, still yelling. ""Shit!"" From a few hundred feet behind, they're firing at me— I know because I can see lines of air and things spraying sparks and bits of themselves all around me. I'm ducking and turning sharply into the next street.

The air is freezing. The night is dark. Streetlights and neon pass by as lines of fire; almost nobody is driving. It's terrifyingly empty. About a half hour later, I'm out of the city. I pull behind an abandoned gas station, cut my engine, step off of my bike, and collapse into the wall. I can't seem to cry or think about what I'll do next. All I can do is stare and think about how fucked it all was, how I want to go back to before it all happened.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_lfgyx,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/lfgyx/the_protean_incident/,

It was dark, the window was open, a warm breeze blowing through the curtains. Outside the din of city life had quieted to its nocturnal stupor. He could hear a cat scrounging down in the alleyway.

Jack reached his arm to the empty space in his bed next to him, forgetting for a moment that Martha was gone. Had it really been 18 months already? Jack reached to his other side under the mattress to feel for his cold steel revolver. That, at least, was in it's place.

He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stood up. Groggily wandering around the apartment in his underwear, trying to forget the scent of Martha. She had been his everything, and he had given her everything, including a child. But God was not kind and that night, 18 months ago God took her, and the child, in one fell swoop. One bloody swoop that was no accident.

The instrument of this crime was a 6 inch blade, left at the scene. No fingerprints, no suspects, no motive. Jack had been drinking and came home late, only to discover his pregnant wife bloodied and lifeless.

The horror had not sunken in immediately. Jack was not particularly cold, but he was calculating. He would unravel the mystery and take his vengeance. His first thoughts were violent ones, but then despair sunk in, and sadness and he wept until the police arrived.

The investigation lasted for months. But there were no leads, Martha had no enemies, nor did Jack. He was just a schoolteacher, 11th grade english. Who could have been so brutal and why?

That was the question that haunted Jack's mind tonight. He opened the fridge. Condiments. And a half cup of milk. He drank the milk from the carton and tossed it at the trashcan. Jack's mind went to the days before the city, when he and martha would take long walks in the woods and make picnics by the ocean. But Jack didn't have the income to support a child and had to move to this very damn apartment.

Since then Jack couldn't stand to look at children. He became obsessed with solving the crime even after the police had given up. Picture's of the scene were etched into his mind. He had to clear his head.

Jack dressed and put on a coat and left the apartment. He went trudging down the sidewalk next to brick buildings with only the light of a few sparse lampposts.

As Jack walked he came upon a bum, sleeping covered under a blanket. He kicked the bum as he walked, the anger inside of him swelling from frustration. The man did not wake but rolled over like a rag doll. Jack leaned down and shook the man trying to wake him. The blanket fell away from his face and the figure of an old rotting corpse stared back at Jack. Jack dropped the man immediately and took a step back startled.

Then a dead hand reached up from under the blanked and grabbed Jack's hand. Jack could feel the icy touch of death as the creature turned to look at him once more. ""IT WAS YOU!"" the creature moaned, pointing into Jack's heart with his dead fingers. ""IT WAS YOUUU!""

Jack woke up suddenly and reached to his side. The warm skin of Martha rest on the bed beside him, her swelling belly rising and falling with every breath. Jack reached to his other side under the mattress where he found a 6 inch blade, cold and steel, right in its place.

It was late September, and we were walking through the park together. I guess I had complained one time too many, because he carefully took me off his shoulders to stand in front of him. I looked up at him and repeated, “I’m cold, daddy.” “Here,” he said to me, kneeling, “take this.” He had given me his hat. The candy hat. Red and white striped all the way up to the top, with a big red pom-pom on it. He always said that I looked the happiest I ever had at that exact moment. That was about 7 months before the divorce.
It’s january 2009 now, and I haven’t spoken to him in 3 years. I get a call at 4:30 from South Trenton Medical Center. He had gone into cardiac arrest and was in their custody. I was his only contact information. I moved slowly at first, as of I hadn’t heard the news at all. Lazily, I pulled myself out of bed. It hit me. This was my father. He raised me, and I loved him. I began to panic. I quickly scanned my shitty apartment for something clean. I found a sweater, red and white. Striped.
The cab ride is short, but seems like an eternity. I’m anxious as hell, and only halfway through notice my fingernails dogging into the leather. I let them. The hospital’s doors were heavy, and the inside was barely warmer than the cold outside. Fourth floor, they had said. 402. I knock. An old doctor comes to the door. Grandmotherly but stern. “I’m sorry.”
He was dead. Shit. 3 years we didn’t utter a word to one another. What the fuck Is wrong with me? Where was I? Where am I? As I attempted to run my fingers through my hair, which was now bathed in a cold sweat, I hit upon a familiar feeling. Warm wool, prickly but soft. With a pom-pom on top. I didn’t even remember putting it on. God, I loved him. I miss him. I don’t know what to do with my hands. I’m crying like a child, right there in the hospital hallway. I feel sick. I want to die. I let the tears come as they may, choking back sobs. I want to die. Shit. I’m lost. Lost in grief, lost in anger, lost in the real fucking world. My name is Waldo, and I need to find myself.

We would come together to frolic, to set ourselves free from our daily woes, but too often the old ones would arrive and cut short our jubilee. They would steal our grog, banish the brave, and force us back into their rigid academic bureaucracy.

After several months, the banishment became too frequent an occurrence. Many who once willingly braved the resentment of the elders now cowered in their cells, waiting to be assigned work. Any attempt at triumph seemed hopeless, and the world of the masses was clouded by all that was mundane. We were trapped.

Until he came.

It was a cool October night, an unsettling chill brushing through the barren branches of the autumn trees. The blue-suited servants of the elders monitored the streets, searching for even the faintest hints of enjoyment to abolish. I sat alone in my cell, much like all the others, trudging away at my daily tasks to no foreseeable end. I grimaced as I moved onto the next piece of work, knowing that no matter how much effort was applied, the old ones would judge harshly and criticize all distinguishable imperfections. My emotions were boiling, and I would likely have exploded from hatred if it weren't for the start I received from the sudden knocking at my doorway.

I glanced once, stared again at my work, and took a second, almost comical take. A knock on a door meant either banishment or mail – and no one in the institution had received a letter since the beginning of our imprisonment.

The knocking stopped as suddenly as it had started, lasting only for a moment. I stepped out of my seat and cautiously approached the door, preparing myself for the worst.

Hands ashake, I grasped the handle and uneasily turned it clockwise. At that time I was positive that I was going to be exhumed. But rather than a towering official notifying me of all that I dreaded, I found my doorway to be vacant, absent of physical matter save for the surrounding atmosphere and a small yellow envelope resting at the bottom. I picked it up with haste and slammed my door aclose.

“Student” it said on the front, with no other words to be seen. Though a trap was likely, I disregarded my instincts and tore off the top with blind anticipation. A lone piece of paper rested within, folded to fit perfectly inside the casing. It read:

“Dear student. Tonight is the night. No more shame, no more cowardice. We will party. - A friend.”

On the back of the note was an address, a directive to an abandoned home that hadn't been occupied for ages and was deemed by the elders to be “unfit for student life”. Emotions ran through my mind in indiscriminate and overwhelming waves, confusion clouding my thoughts as much as excitement. “What?” was the primary question, yet another was “How?” and an equally valid inquiry stood to be “Why?”. I could hear my peers reacting verbally in the cells adjacent to my own. It was clear that many others had also been asked to attend

In a jaded state, my thought fog shrouded most rational oppositions to leaving. Banishment was not a matter, nor was fear of arrest. My curio had long since taken precedence, and the only thing that mattered was to have it pacified. Thus, I walked.

I behaved mannered and casual on my stroll to the gathering, avoiding the gazes of the blue-suits by blending in and hiding my intense anticipation. I could see my peers acting similarly, all walking ordinarily but on the edge of shrouded enthrallment. I felt good, for the first time in months. I sensed that a strong resolve was approaching. Something positive was on its way.

From the moment I turned the corner onto Bronze Street, I was elated, hearing joyous tones that had not been murmured for what seemed like a lifetime. My body began to carry itself towards the sound, my mind adrift in a fantastical trance. “Could this be true?” I thought to myself. “A party amidst such strict elder rule?” But it was.

The house was alive with grog-drenched laughter and the livelihood of socially stimulated youth. My senses told me that I was in heaven, but it was merely a party. The consistent deprivation of genuine enjoyment that I was regularly subjected to made that which stood before me seem all the more otherworldly. It was amazing, at the very least.

The chatter carried on, with friends and individuals expressing themselves as they hadn't done in months. But in spite of this overwhelmingly joyous behavior, a looming question begged at the fringe of my mind – who had put on this extravagant, daring party? Was it the same man who sent the letter? Why had he done it? I had to discover the identity of the savior of our morale. It was an absolute.

Before I could even begin to search for the answers, however, the dreaded flashing cars of the blue-suits were outside the house, their lights droning systemically in the windows and the howl of their sirens tearing through the atmosphere like the chilling scream of a soul reaper. With the blink of my eye came chaos, desperate yells and attempts to escape. No one sought banishment, and no one sought arrest. All sought to be free.

In the midst of the freakout, a bellowing voice reached out from above the home and directed itself towards every blue-suit in sight. “HEYYYYY!” it bellowed. The students stopped shuffling their feet and stood still, attention now paid to this unexpected act of brazen bravery. I was as bewildered as the rest.

Several elders had gathered around their law-enforcing subservients, directing an all-encompassing gaze of pure accusation at every individual in the home. I shuddered, as did many others, at the chilling vacancy of their stare.

“Step down from the house immediately.” came the megaphone. A lone blue-suit, the captain of the brigade, stood sternly in front of the rest, sound amplifier pointed towards the man atop the house. “You're all under arr...”

“NO!” boomed the man, his tenacity held to a point with every fluctuation of his vocal chords. Both crowds were aghast with awe.

Again the megaphone called “Come down, or we will be forced to...”

“LISTEN TO ME!” he cried. The confidence and surety of his tone were enough to make even his enemies feel proud of him, the man who dared to defy their authority.

“This institution...” he began “was created long ago, by great men and women, for both education and personal growth.” He paused. To me it felt like a presidential commencement address, his voice so absolutely strong that the intensity was palpable. Everyone awaited his continuation.

“Look at it now. What has become of it? What has the bureaucracy done to improve the lives of the most important people – the youth?” This question seemed to unsettle the elders. One spoke in direct response “This college was designed for one purpose, and one purpose only – to learn. Personal fulfillment has no place in our...” his justification was cut short by an angered collective crowd bellow, myself participating. Several students moved to the forefront, with two blue-suits repositioning in response. The tension in the atmosphere was rising, I could feel it.

“In your what?” yelled the man. “Your twisted, emotionless, money-seeking hearts? Do you have any idea how much these kids – your students – have been suffering?” He flicked his eyes to the blue-suits. “Have you never bothered to question the morality of what you're doing here?” They were begrudgingly attentive, and I saw one bow his head in what could only have been shame. “It's a police state, nothing less.” said the man. A few cries of agreement could be heard.

The elder who had spoken was scowling, his lips trembling with privileged disgust and hatred. He was prepared to speak when the voice of the savior student crushed his looming interjection attempt, raining down upon our ears like a bath of liberative truth. “Bros, lads, and all collegiates.” Our attention was undivided, with every ounce of focus directed towards the speaker. “I brought you all here not just to frolic and to relax. Beer and friends are here, yes, but that is not the driving intention behind this gathering.” Brief murmurs of discussion swept through the crowd. “I brought you here to remind you of what it feels like.” He paused for a moment, then continued “What it feels like... to be free.” By this time, tears were copiously falling from my face, my conscious mind an overwhelmed trench of emotionally charged memories. Memories of freedom, memories of friends. Memories from so very long ago. I started to cry.

“Do not weep, my brothers, my sisters. This unjust cruelty ends now. It ends tonight!” The eagerness was dripping from his vocal productions like the salted tears of the woeful student body. We were ready, we were sure. It was time.

I screamed to the absolute limit of my vocal muscles, the resultant screech barely adding to the chorus of liberated student minds. In perfect synchronization, we all cried “Yes!!!” The time had come to shine, to take back the college that was rightfully ours. Boredom and resentment vanished in the place of excitement and friendship, and the party that night marked an epiphany in university life.


The blue-suits were awakened by the speech of the elusive roof man. They arrested all elders and old ones in the college town for unjust treatment of youth and countless robberies of grog. New, more considerate “profs” took their place, minds set on youthful engagement and societal advancements rather than personal monetary greed. Before many were even aware, the institution had transformed.

The only trace the man left of his identity was a brim-filled keg of premium draft beer, addressed to all the students of the college (myself included). Because of this, he garnered the moniker “Keg Bro”. It suited him, I thought, in both content and ambiguity.

However, the last thing I want is to come across as pitiful, or sad, or lonely, even though I must confess to being all of the above. life is a strange gift, it is something we do not ask for, yet we accept it as a necessity. Now, when I look back, I see all the time wasted. I can see now how I continued to spend all that time living with the intention of living, even though I knew I must die. I use the term 'living' loosely, because of my delusion that I would continue to live, it allowed me to continue in a state of routine, where nothing changed, no rights were wronged and nothing was done to make my life have some form of purpose once again.

It's a sad thing to admit, and most definitely a sad thing to realise, that you have spent very little of your life actually living, that you have spent so much of your time on autopilot without considering or acknowledging it, that when the end inevitably comes, you will regret each of those moments not fully cherished.

My memory has faded somewhat, but I remember the reasons why I find myself alone in this hospital. There are so many. I could list how I pushed away each and every person, but in the end it would only serve to remind me of my mistakes and my regret. Despite this, it ought to be said that I am entirely to blame for my own downfall. I have lived my life in ignorance and reinforced it with arrogance and stubbornness, if I could take it back- if I could take everything back- I would. I would plead with my friends to forgive, I would beg my lovers not to leave me and I would have been there for my family, because they were always there for me.

Alas, we cannot turn back time, all I can do is wallow in regret of moments wasted, hoping that somehow it will make a difference.

One of the great ironies of life- at least in mind- is that humanity strives for happiness, and yet is constantly dissatisfied with their lot. Rich and poor, black and white, men and women, all of them strive for more. All of them are miserable, and all of them end up in the same place once they are dead.

The end is coming soon. I can feel it, and it scares the hell out of me. I wish I could confide in someone, I wish there was someone to assure me that everything is going to be fine, but the truth is, even if there was someone here to tell me as much, I wouldn't believe them. We don't know what happens when we die, some of us claim to know, but nothing can be proven, nothing is certain, heaven and hell are just as likely as reincarnation, and reincarnation is just as likely as nothing at all. Either way, I am terrified, even though I know I have nothing left to live for, the end still scares me.

I suppose I should finish writing and close my eyes for a while, I have been drowsy for a long time now, maybe it is all the sedatives that are being pumped into my system, or maybe it is the illness, either way, it is useless resisting. 

Before I go however, I did want to say one thing. I wanted to say I am sorry, to everyone I ever wronged, to everyone and anyone I ever pushed away or hurt, I am sorry, from the bottom of my heart. I lived my life as a spiteful human being, and I cannot ever forgive myself, but I loved you, I loved all of you, even the ones I hated, because you gave my life purpose, and without you, my life would have meant nothing.

So it would seem that is it. I needed to say sorry and thank you. I can't forget my manners. I simply wish my final thoughts to be that of thankfulness. I will be thankful to join those I have lost, mostly my dear mother who I have missed for over thirty years, I will be with her soon, and for that too, I am thankful.

This will be the last memoir I write. The last words I put on paper. I suppose there should be some kind of conclusion or catharsis, something that ties all loose ends and wraps everything up nicely, but I don't have that power. Really, there is only word left to say, and that word is:

It started out so innocently. Barely knew you were there. But over the last few months, no one is denying your existence anymore. Sure, my wife said you were a bit mean when she first thought you were around. No worries, normal stuff, nothing to get upset over, right? Maybe she was even making some of it up? But those first signs of abuse should have been a key indication of what was to come.

Everyday I’d go to work thinking things were fine. She would give me reassurances that she was tip top, and nothing was the matter. I’d tell my co-workers what was going on, only to receive laughs and smiles. “Is this the proper reaction to a hostage situation?” I think back wondering how it got this way so fast.

Months pass and things seemed to be escalating. She would inform me of pains, and problems. I would ask her if there was anything I could do to help. “Don’t worry about it. It’s all normal,” brushing my attempts at assistance away. “Not a whole lot you can do,” would be the rebuttal. Feeling powerless in these situations, anxiety can turn to worry. Sometimes daydreams to be released from this captor play out in my mind, wanting for some kind of way to change the predicament for the best, with as little consequence as possible. These thoughts and schemes are a constant plague on my reality.

More time passes. We learn more about you, your name for a start. Funny how we could all go so long without knowing what to call you, but understanding between captor and hostage takes time doesn’t it. I guess now we can have a proper dialogue. You don’t really say much, but we are well aware of your intentions. We know what you have in store for us, more so what you have in store for my wife. It scares her tremendously, but she carries on. Strong enough to withstand what pain you put her through. Again I wish for some way to help her through this, to stand in and take some of that pain for her. But I am not your target, she is.

Your demands are starting to take their toll. I try and contemplate what help I could get, who I could contact. But we are so far gone at this point, there really isn’t much anyone can do. Long before now, we would stop anyone trying to intervene. Yes, we are both so attached to you, o captor, we would fight tooth and nail for your safety, despite what pain you cause.

The day comes that one of your attacks is too much. She is in so much pain. Bodily fluids have been spilt. She needs medical attention. As we all proceed to the hospital, thoughts run through my mind. “It’s almost over. The opportunity is here. We’re getting out of this.” Neither one of us leave her side. This relationship has turned very different, but no one is paying any attention. It takes many hours, but she if finally calm and stable. Things are quiet, and she is sleeping.

As I finally take this chance to have a face-to-face with you properly, I hold you close. “Damn son, your brother didn’t screw with us this much.” I give you a kiss, and lay you back in your crib. We get to take you home tomorrow. Suddenly I realize you and your brother will be holding us hostage for the next 18-20 years. But that is ok, I’m going to love every minute of it.

As the procedure began he relished a feeling that had always been one he reveled in.

He was now exceedingly curious.

When they opened his mind he began to see all of humanity as he knew it aging and evolving on Earth. He didn't evolve, instead he was there, just observing, sating his curiosity.

He was now extremely curious.

He saw the Earth becoming over-populated. It was ok though, space travel allowed him to travel outside our realms.

He was now delightfully curious.

As humanity continued to expand all throughout the universe he saw things that were unexplainable to him. He saw the stars being harnessed for un-limited amounts of energy, he saw humanity curing all diseases and, most fascinating, he saw our shapes change as evolution occurred over a period of years he couldn't fathom.

He was now cautiously curious.

He saw people change over time into things that looked alien to him. They were not only more advanced politically and economically, but also physically. With disease being cured they could live forever.

He was now dreadfully curious.

Trillions of years had passed before him at this point when everything started to darken. All of the hopeful feelings he felt dissipated as the void swallowed the universe and the curious man along with it. All he could see now was a tiny form in a vast expanse of black.

He was now fearfully curious.

The form was virtually un-recognizable to him. It was just a small, wheezing creature with a thin layer of membrane covering its vital organs.

He was now grimly curious.

He approached the creature but dared not touch it. A thin layer of mucus covered the tiny shape's body, leaving it there dripping wet. It made a sickening sound that repulsed the curious man.

He was now morbidly curious.

Against his better judgement he reached a hand down to flip the creature over. Mucus dripped from his fingers but it had a consistency to it that he had never felt before.

He was now alarmingly curious.

Once he flipped the form over he saw a face. The only thing that puzzled him was the face looked familiar to him for some reason even though it lacked any recognizably human characteristics. He picked up the creature to try and help it.

He was now sickeningly curious.

As he stood there holding the creature he watched it wheeze its final breath and die, almost as if it was trying to communicate with him.

At this the man was no longer curious.

He is now only alone, for the wheezing shape was the last human child to ever be born and contact with the curious man had killed it.

The banal paint slowly inching itself from the walls, revealing a dark hole that was covered. In the middle of it was a chair, next to it a lamp. Between the two was a woman, standing, talking. In the chair, a man, the darkness of the room covering most of his body and face. The lamp illuminated but a part of him, revealing little.  
“I’m tired of here,” said the man.  
“Where’s here?” replied the woman.  
“Here”  
“But what is here?” she said, crossing her arms.  
“Nothing”  
“There’s the lamp, chair, carpet, and the paint”  
“Barely”  
The low hum of the lamp extended throughout the room, penetrating the surrounding area.  
“Well what do you mean?” the woman asked.  
“The paint, it’s barely there, just look at it.”  
She walked over to the hole, the paint and plaster covering the hole was fading and chipping away, a deep, dark hole residing where there should be a hole.  
“You could just fix it.” thought the woman.  
“But you can’t” said the man, slouching further into the chair, the smoke of his freshly lit cigarette obscuring the light around him.  
“Why not?” asked the woman.  
“It’s not something you just fix, it’s a process.” Explained the man  
“I don’t quite understand”  
“You have to cover it, heal it with the plaster, then repaint it and hope it’s okay.”  
“So why don’t you just do that?” she asked him.  
“That’s hard, and it’s never quite right once it’s done, never the same.” he said, taking a drag from his smoke.  
“Is that why you wont fix it? Because it won’t be the same?” she exclaimed.  
“Yes.”  
The sun drew further below the window line, the room growing darker with each passing minute. It felt like an eternity as the clock in the corner inched towards the hour. Each moment he spent with her made the minutes pass longer, the ashes falling from his cigarette fell slower towards the ground.  
“Why can’t you just do it, it’s simple enough, all you have to do is patch it and paint it.”  
“It’s never that simple, it never has been that simple.” he told her.  
“I’m tired of this, I’m leaving now, don’t bother coming after me.” She said, walking towards the door.  
It slammed shut, the sun now gone; the clock struck the hour, ringing throughout the room. The light of his smoke diminished, the bulb in the lamp flickering fast and then slow. He fell further into his seat, left alone in his sea of consciousness.

After the bombs were tested half a century ago, this place never recovered.  
There was nothing here but holes in the ground.    

So when I got a call from dispatch that a vehicle was seen entering the area, my curiosity was peaked as to why anyone would drive out there.  
I turned off my TV, locked my guard shack, and stepped outside into the cold night.  
I started driving down the only paved road for miles, then turned off the street onto a dirt path, leaving the glare of street lights.  
As my jeep headlights peered over the hill onto the barren plains, a small black vehicle came into view.  
I slowly approached, and I started to see the outline of someone on top of the car.  
I parked my jeep close to him, turning on my brights to get a better view.    

He just kept lying there on the roof of his car.    

I stepped out onto the dry sand and shout at him to identify himself.  
He quietly replied, ""There's no one to yell over, so why shout?""  
A little taken back by his calm manner, I asked him something out of both duty and personal curiosity, ""What are you doing out here?""    

""Until you came here I was enjoying the view,"" he said with a slight annoyance.  
I looked around us at the wide area.  
There was nothing except a few mounds that could barely be called hills.    

My mind baffled, I asked him: ""What view?""  
His reply: ""Turn off your headlights, they're distracting.""    

His attitude was starting to get annoying,  
so I told him that as a government officer I wanted to know why he was out here.    

Silence.    

I walked towards him, then something stopped me.  
I had to know something.  
I went back to my jeep, and I switched off the headlights, and looked around.  
Still nothing.    

Agitated, I went up to his car and demanded he come down and face me.  
All I could hear was, ""How can anyone be so agitated with a view like this?""  
I finally shouted at the top of my voice, ""WHAT VIEW!!""    

He said in a voice that seemed both patronizing, yet fatherly, ""Look up.""    

I looked up, and my mind slipped the bonds of Earth to touch the heavens.  
I sat there with the mysterious man until dawn, when he finally climbed down from his roof.  
As he got into his car he looked back and me and said something that, at the time, I didn't quite understand.    

The next night I was back in my little shack for my shift, and as I was reaching for my TV remote I stopped.  
I put the remote down, and turned off the lights, and looked up through the window and watched the Night sky.  
I understood what he told me.    

""Once you've learned to look up, you'll never again want to look down.""

There is a man in a yellow jumpsuit standing in the snow outside my basement peephole.

I see his filthy boot and gun-barrel. I'm silent as I peer out the four-inch cavity exposed after  I removed the aluminum duct and insulation for my dryer vent. I hear him taking a piss, whistling the new Anthem.

His comrades, two Tenders in yellow jumpsuits, are across the road confronting my neighbor Albert in his driveway. The Tenders are pointing and shouting demands in Ahahuascan, the new language of the World Government.

Albert’s wife and chubby teenage son are huddled together in the snow under a Nascar sleeping bag. Albert is being prompted at gunpoint to lay his collection of guns down on his driveway. The Tenders have one of those creepy metallic Dog-Bastards for troop support - it's the size of a Ford Fiesta - AWG's latest model - a mechanized kill-machine. The Dog-Bastard has poised itself between Albert’s family and the doorway of their house, a blue light radiating from the transparent dome on its head signals a passive status.

Albert is pissed off. He’s going on and on about the Second Amendment and rations and the AWG and poisoned food. He's eye-popped and shirtless. The giant bald eagle tattooed on his heaving beer-belly looks as if it's going to launch off his jiggling gut at the jumpsuits. Albert spits toward the jumpsuits and storms back into his house for another armload of guns. He kicks open his screen door, coming out with a gigantic American flag draped over his shoulders, wearing it like a poncho.

The Tender outside my peephole sprints across my yard, crossing the road to warn his comrades, shouting “Svat! Svat! Svat!” He points his rifle toward the Dog-Bastard and focuses a laser-pointer beam at the blue dome on its head.

The dome on the Dog-Bastard’s head flashes from passive blue to stop-light red, a grinding-whizzy sound like a Gyrotron at the county fair erupts from under its ribs.

Albert snaps his right hand out from the poncho. He produces a sawed-off and drives the barrel into the head of the nearest jumpsuit, making it disappear into an explosion of blood and skull, splatting his comrade’s face-shield like pizza toppings. The man attempts to clear the gore from his facemask, spreading blood and gristle across the plexi-glass like a bug-smeared windshield.

The sprinting Tender fires a haphazard rifle-shot - blood spurts from the eagle's head tattooed on Albert's belly. The impact drives the fat man backward into the snowbank like a star-spangled garbage sack..

The Dog-Bastard leaps forward and straddles Albert’s body. A twisting piston is thrust from its rib-cage, plunging into Albert, punching through his stomach into the snowbank. Skin - coils of gut - flag-scraps - snow. Each time the piston retreats back into the Dog-Bastard's body, it pulls back pieces of my neighbor.

January 17, 2019

I am hiding this handwritten testimony in a plastic sandwich container, buried in the bottom of my empty water softener salt-basin; the same basin that I hid inside last week while the Tenders cleared my house.

My hard drives were wiped clean by an electromagnetic pulse six days ago, erasing my original computer journal and my electronic contact with the rest of the world. The news-feed is gone. We have gone Radio Beijing.

The Tenders took Abby - I took that the worst - my dog. They found her whimpering under the stairs when their Spiders scanned my basement. I nearly bit a hole in my cheek stifling my rage, silent in my salt-tub. The Tenders forced resident work crews to board up the windows.   I am trapped inside my home.

After the outbreak of the Sceptre-A virus, an imaginary disease concocted by the AWG, Americans were encouraged by the media to get vaccinated against this fictional virus. Like most of the then-obedient population, I received the flu shot after we were warned about the spreading epidemic. Holdouts who refuse the shot are being hunted down, sent to camps and processed.

The vaccination is taking charge of my will. I feel larvae in my mucus - a pulsing virus in my blood - tapeworms under my eyelids - re-assembling. I feel their intelligence. My body has become a hive.

January 18, 2019

Three holdouts on snowmobiles are trying to open the fire hydrant across the street. A flannel-clad man is twisting on the spigot with a huge wrench while his companions keep watch for Tenders, their snowmobiles idling in the street.

Szee-szip-szee-szip-szee-szip sounds come from the north, out of my line of vision. The two men keeping watch hear the coming threat, arming themselves with chunks of re-bar. Entering the frame are several mechanized Spiders. The pumpkin-sized daddy-long-legs tippy-toe within four car lengths of the holdouts - the Spiders halt - their blue eyes switch to red.

The holdouts haul-ass to their idling snowmobiles. The Spiders spring from the pavement. The shrill sszzzzzeeeeee blasting from the Spiders is in a frequency that shatters the icicles hanging from my roof. Two of the holdouts make it to their snowmobiles as the flannel-clad man takes a swing at the nearest Spider with his wrench. He is overtaken by two of the insects at his waist. The first Spider scrambles up his back, contorting the screaming man into a kneeling position. The second Spider skitters forward with an extended leg tipped with a syringe. It drives a needle into each of the man's legs, his lower extremities become frozen into place while his torso thrashes around in a semicircle, making him gag and croak, flailing in a mad aerobic exercise.

Abandoning their companion, the two remaining holdouts accelerate their snowmobiles out of view with three Spiders in pursuit, their surgical red eyes focused on their prey.

It's dark now. I cannot see the flannel-clad man pinned in the snow, but his damned croaking is making my blood pop like seltzer bubbles.

Headlights from an approaching vehicle reveal the flannel-clad man into my frame once again. I see the front end of a converted mail truck, its filthy headlights illuminating the flannel-clad man in a sick yellow glow. Two Tenders in yellow body armor approach the man, chattering to each other in Ahuauascan. They place an egg-shaped beacon in the snow at the man's knees, blanketing him in a red aura. One of the Tenders karate-kicks the poor guy in the chest, snapping him backward - then forward, like a kid’s bouncy toy. The laughing Tenders return to the mail-truck and leave the scene.

I need water. I am running out of matches, candles, battery life. I ate my last can of kidney beans. Writing is very difficult. My hands feel like they belong to someone else. I am enamored of the beautiful red beacon, glowing in the street.

Szeet-Clomp-Szeet-Clomp - approaching from the west. A Dog-Bastard with two Spiders march into view behind the flannel-clad man. He’s writhing in the snow like an insane living statue. This Dog-Bastard is the size of a Jersey cow with its skin and muscles removed - a silver-framed monster of perfection with rubber tendons. It stands behind the man and extends a long tubular siphon. It drives the translucent tube into the man's back. His croaking erupts into an agonized scream.

The Dog-Bastard sucks gore through the siphon into a deflated sac hanging from under its backbone, the red dome on its head pulses like the cherry-light on the roof of a cop car.

The man becomes a flannel-clad husk - his juices draining in chunks through the siphon into the Dog-Bastard’s expanding sac.

The metallic beast retracts its siphon, dropping the flannel-clad man’s withered body into the snow like a blown-down scarecrow.

 A Spider tippy-toes past my peephole.


 I am so very quiet.


 January 19, 2019

I drank the last of my water. I was going to scoop snow from outside the dryer vent hole with a measuring cup duct-taped to a broom handle, but I thought against it. Any movement outside the house will alert the motion-detecting drones scanning the neighborhood. The egg-beacon is still glowing its red invitation outside my peephole. It’s radiation has melted the snow in a perfect circle, I tentatively reach my arm through my peephole to feel it’s warmth.

I felt a beetle scurry across my skull, it's using my scalp as a bed-sheet. I know it is...I know it.

I sliced the palm of my hand open on a piece of sharp copper breaking apart frozen water pipes. My hand hurts less than it should. My blood is thick - a pale pus oozing out. There are tiny silver dots that look like b.b’s in the blood. The little balls are skipping and popping on my bloody palm like water drops on a burning skillet.

January 2submit0, 2019

The egg-man inside the beacon is whispering to me. He’s saying that I can feel it’s comfort it if I kick out the barrier on the second-floor window and jump into the snow. The egg-man says Abby is hungry -Abby needs to be fed.

It has been a year.

One whole year since you were taken from me, one whole year since the entire world went to shit, and for some reason I was left behind to pick up the pieces.

The others still have some hope that things will get better, but I know that hope is pointless, how could the world heal itself after such destruction, after such devastation?

They predict 90% of the population succumbed to the infection. Those are the odds we are up against. The truth be told my dearest Julia, my hope died with you, I don’t even know why I try anymore.


Dear Julia,

I came home today.

I came back to the place where we began. This house is so full of memories of happiness, it saddens me that it is all gone, that there is nothing left.

Memories are fickle companions, but what is worse is that i feel them becoming distorted, I fear the image I have of you is fading, altering, changing into something that is not you at all, but a depiction of what I believed you to be instead of what you are.

I do not want my memory of you to fade, Julia.

I abandoned everyone else. They will continue without me, I just needed to be here. I needed to be with you.

Even if you are gone, you linger in this place still. In the darkest corners of the house, and of my mind.


Dear Julia,

I became infected today. I gave in to the temptation, the curiosity; the bitter hopelessness. I kissed death upon the lips, and found the taste to my liking. 

I know you would disapprove Julia; you had such an affinity for living, and would want me to carry on no matter what the cost. But I ask you… and I ask myself, would you feel the same were you in my place, after all the things I have seen, all the horrors I have experienced, all the people I have lost; would you feel the same?

The infection process isn’t instantaneous; it takes several days for it to truly take you away. I wonder if part of you remains, even after you become one of those mindless creatures that roam the streets at night? I don’t want that. I think that would be the cruellest punishment, crueller by far than death.

I will be with you soon Julia.

   
Dear Julia,

I awoke this morning, not feeling quite myself; evidently the infection is in its early stages. It would appear to be a common flu, but we all know better now. We are no longer ignorant to the deviousness of this clever infection, it tricks you into believing you are suffering from an illness that appears non-threatening, and then when you believe you are beginning to recover, that is when it attacks.

I live in constant fear of that attack, Julia. I was surprised by my fear; I suppose it has become so commonplace living in this new world that it is now second nature.

I’m almost glad you cannot see the world today, my dear. Nowhere is home, yet everything with a roof is considered a house. I returned to our home for the end, but it does not look like our home; not anymore. It is almost unbearable to stay between these walls, underneath this roof, where we once shared so much happiness, knowing the things I know now. It breaks my heart to see this perfect haven become a part of the imperfect world I have been drifting through the past year. It won’t be much longer now. I won’t last much longer now.


Dear Julia,

The trees outside our house are bare. It isn’t winter. There are simply no leaves that wish to grow. The walls are cracked and worn, the whole place is falling apart; not that it matters much anymore. Nothing matters much anymore.

The illness seems to be subsiding. I feel more agile and less lethargic. I know what this means though, you know Julia. I know.


Dear Julia,

Is this what you went through? Is this how you felt? I hope you didn’t feel this pain, I pray to god you didn’t.

My skin… it aches Julia, everything I touch brings me pain, my clothes itch and irritate my flesh. I need to get out. I need to get out of my skin. How can I endure this, how could anyone endure this? I am writing this letter with the greatest effort, in some vain hope that someone will read this, and one day put us both out of our eternal misery.

Oh god… My eyes, Julia… MY FUCKING EYES. It feels almost as if someone has forced shards of sand beneath my eyelids. There is no moisture, just pain, and an utter lack of vision.

I don’t know how long this will last before I am gone, I can only hope the end comes soon; I cannot bear this pain much longer.


Dear Julia,

The end is upon me. We will be together again before long.
This feeling is abhorrent, I feel my blood running through my veins and arteries, but it has thickened, and it feels almost as though sludge is being pumped through my system. I have been suffering from bouts of stomach cramps that leave me quivering on the floor. I haven’t eaten for several days; then again, I don’t have much of an appetite.

My vision only grew worse, the pain, I couldn’t take it any longer… so I ripped out my left eye; the relief was tremendous, if only temporary. I barely felt any pain during the process, but afterwards, after the blood and mush that was left of my eye was in the palm of my hands, that was when the agony set in. The blood that oozed from my eye socket was nothing like human blood. It was so dark it was almost black, and as thick as custard.

I can taste blood on my tongue. Blood and bile. The empty space where my eye once was only aches now, but everywhere aches, everywhere hurts. This is agony in its purest, undiluted form.

  
Dear Julia,

The pain has become so natural to me now that I can scarcely feel it. That or the pain has merely subsided as the infection finally takes complete control of my body.

I came down to see you today, with what was left of my vision, for the last time. The basement stank; the putrid fumes of death linger there, along with you.

Your dead eyes stared back at me, and even through one unfocused lens I could see your beauty, your elegance, your grace.

Even though most of your flesh has abandoned your face, and your hair is frayed and dead, I can still see the woman I fell in love with. Despite every obstacle, when I look at you, there is nothing but clarity and I feel assured that my decision to become just like you was the right one.

I will be leaving this world, this form; very soon, I can feel parts of myself fading away, and those parts being replaced with this repulsive infection. But I am thankful, because I will be like you.

We will be the same. We will be together again.

We will be the same.

We will be the same.

This was such a great time in my life.  Girls thought I was hot, I really hadn’t quite hit puberty yet, I had great friends to fuck around with, and best of all, I discovered weed.  When everyone starts smoking weed they think they’re the shit, and my friends and I were no exception.  It was like being in this cool exclusive club that came with its own music and carefree lifestyle.  Needless to say, I was stoked to be in this nonconformist crazy pot culture; after my first few puffs of the ganja I immersed myself into the lifestyle.  The “Mac miller” look, that’s what I went for. Snap back, cargo shorts, a plain white tee and a backpack with a dime bag of weed in it.  My friends and I really became this scumbag look for a better part of a year.  But, weirdly enough girls seemed to dig the loser stoner look so I wasn’t complaining.  My best friend at the time was Cole.  We first started smoking together and became inseparable that whole summer.  I convinced him to take his first hit and after that we would always smoke together.  We were the type of people that wouldn’t even say anything but would just look at each other and die laughing.  He was my best friend.  After a while Cole never wanted to be sober.  Whatever would get him acting like a fool he would take, and that’s where things started to change.  That’s where my innocent pot-smoking friend morphed into a different person. I’m convinced he lost his personality.  Looking back at it, there was never really a falling out between us, just a loss of connection.  After a while all Cole would talk about was the “crazy” rave he went to and how much molly and acid he was doing next weekend.  He just wanted to get higher, and I couldn’t relate to him. His personality grew to become this pothead tripped-out person I thought we were just merely emulating.  That’s why I like to think back to sophomore year and the first hit of pot we took together.  The drug infused laughter we would get into as kids, and the girls we would hook up with.  I realize now that I was just playing a character and being a goofball, the difference is that Cole let the character take over his life.

She loved seagulls, they were so beautiful. They were free to fly wherever they wanted. They were able to escape any situation at the flap of a wing.

She turned her back on the water to look up at the towering yellow cables which held the structure together. There were more seagulls up there, building homes and raising their young. She thought of how they would be able to fly for their first time as they began exploring the world.

She closed her eyes again and longed for that freedom. She heard their calls to one another faintly behind the loud exhales of passing cars. Then, with a deep breath she leaned back into the air, and for a moment she was able to fly.

He treads water and clenches to his split and failing craft. He says,


""And so I lay here on the splinters of my self spun boat. These planks I hewed  and wrapped in sinewy fibers. These oars I snapped from limbs and carved. The cracks were caulked by mine own  hand. And proving water tight I sailed. And now it's just hardly sinking in. 
So what of my final home? Where am I to set my weariness? It's been some years last I was blessed and sinned I have since. Not only under great duress but often. 


For instance, more or less every time she was there. I'd break to stretch my legs and walk the block thru the market to saunter past she, the dancing lass on the corner. Just this bit uncovered by the buttressed booths awnings and she dancing in the break of it, in the eye of it, in that one shaft of light amidst all of it, she ran with the capstan and called to all hands, we weather this squall I'll see once more my betrothed! 


She never saw me though. And I but briefly stood by there, to admire her twirlings and soak in her, illustrious. So my pleased smile, my eyes so warm, my even clap to the fiddler's foot, it all tasked the viewer to match my own gaiety. 


And blending so, leading bystanders even by my example, it was a simple thing  to walk right past as she turned her back. I'd spin while I clapped and feinting a fall, grasp right and left and deftly snatch some lustrous coins right from her cup. Tumbling back up and cradling my split head, no one thought me for a second to be a simple street thief, they so stricken in grief with my wail, pain excruciate! 


Not for the need was it did, not for the spare of loose change in my tailored track pants. And I didn't do it for the thrill of the deed, as some mischief making teen might to defy the truth of his prolonged wean from the bottle. No, for I drank like a fish myself! why had you bottled me up then I'd have been your greatest chum. So, no, no miscreant am I, for  I  never drew pleasure from my criminality. and never did  I consider my personal vices to be  the  essential stuff of my character. Why, I washed in the drink like some wash in the tub, that virtue I claim.


And in virtue I am poor, I'll scrap till the last for any bit of it. So no miscreant am I. You might think me then some wayward soul, aimless and in need of direction. You couldn't be wronger. Now, my aim is fine and when I set mine I hit it near every time. But my sights have long been set low, and by some force of inertia, or by that complacentness so apt to befall idealists like myself, I've settled low and never flown far. And in my shade all canopy bowered I've lurked so long I remember none else. Now when I dream, I dream of a cavern deep, one watered dark and pooled. 


Some irony then! Me, here, adrift all sun baked and isolate, like a toy in the bath. But this pool interconnects all over the globe and so really never seperated, I can say my last gasp and wherever she might be sea gazing she need only crane one ear cupped and strain some little bit to hear my words thus:

Please pray for me Amanda, our hearts once joined fast, so that I may see you again when all this has passed.""


His tawny hair drops below the surface, there's no thrashing. Only bubbles, and soon naught.

Charlie Brown parked his car next to a sidewalk about three blocks away from the church. He grabbed the satchel that was in the passenger seat, got out of the vehicle, and locked it. A number of thoughts ran through his head as he walked to the church. He was nervous, because he was about to see a number of faces he hadn’t seen in ages; and torn inside, because his brain was repeating the memory of the phone call he received the week before. What came from the other end of the phone line was a crying Sally, his sister, giving news about the suicide of her husband. Her husband Linus.

As Charlie Brown came up to the chapel doors, he stopped for about ten seconds. Then, in an exhale, he said to himself, “Here goes nothing,” and opened the doors. It was like the Christmas pageant rehearsal all over again, except, no one was dancing, and people finally turned their attention to Charlie Brown.
He was first greeted by Lucy. She said to him, “Oh Charlie Brown, I’m so happy you’re here.” “Hi Lucy”, he said, as he saw over Lucy’s shoulder his sister sobbing over the open casket, and Schroeder playing the church’s organ. It gutted him even a little more seeing the absence of a happy canine dancing on top of the musical instrument.

“I should have been a better sister all those years. Why did I have to be such a blockhead? Why couldn’t I be more gentle and caring?”

“Lucy, you made Linus strong. If it weren’t for you, his blindness toward society would have crushed him before he finally grew up.”

“But Charlie Brown, I was always a monster. Remember when you were in that coma for two weeks because of my stupid football pranks?”

“Don’t worry Lucy. That’s behind us.”

“Sally and I tried our hardest to put together the best funeral and burial we could. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough to purchase doves for tomorrow’s burial. Instead, we had to buy those weird-looking yellow birds.”

“Oh Lucy, it’s perfect. Just perfect.”

Charlie Brown then greeted his sister. He held her in his arms.

“I’m a terrible wife. I should have given him his space. He should have been free to have experienced other women, not stay with someone who was constantly trying to neck him since he was a child.”

“Sally, he didn’t want anybody else. You were meant for him. You gave him all the love you had. You were perfect. Linus was probably just too intelligent, and maybe his knowledge led him to realize something no one should have to realize.”

“Well, Linus did keep mentioning here and there a little about how meaningless life was and always questioned the reason for emotions. His therapist believes that Linus would always conclude his numerous existential crises that there is no purpose for life.”

“See? It was nothing you did. But I should have been there for him all these years.”

“No, don’t blame yourself Charlie. You were busy making a living and you succeeded in your pursuits. You have no idea how proud Linus was of you in your accomplishments in your career. By the why, did you bring your son?”

“No, his mother has full custody of him, and she wasn’t even willing to let me bring him here.”

“Oh what a shame. You know I always knew that woman was terrible for you. You should have at least tried to nab a date with Heather.”

“That was just a schoolboy crush. She was always out of my league. And then when she dropped out of high school, I knew there was no way of ever seeing her.”

Suddenly, Charlie Brown heard a voice behind him say, “Hey Chuck, is your wife making you hold her purse for her while she has another period? Or are you finally queer like me?”

Charlie Brown turned around and saw Peppermint Patty standing, with Marcy next to her. “I had no idea men could grow balder. You sure got lucky you didn’t end up with him, sir,” said Marcy.

“Good grief,” said Charlie Brown, “Did you two honestly think tank tops and sandals would be appropriate to wear to a funeral? Show some respect.”

“YOU show some respect, you patriarchal pig!” said Peppermint Patty. “You think you’re such a big shot since you left everybody to go to business school. You’re just a capitalist fascist now.”

“Why all the hate, Peppermint Patty? What’s wrong with you? What did I ever do to make you hate me?”

“What do you think, asshole? All those years of you teasing me and never making a move. What was wrong with YOU? Oh what, you were too depressed for me? You were always a buzzkill. Good god, it’s a mystery that you weren’t the one that ended up committing suicide, ya know that? You’re the reason I hate men. Thank god I eventually realized that my true love was always right beside me,” Peppermint Patty said as she put her arm around Marcy.


“Well then why are you being such a pissy bitch if you found love? Didn’t you hear that California finally legalized same-sex marriage?”

“WE DON’T EVEN LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, DOME HEAD!” And then the next thing Charlie Brown saw after Peppermint Patty’s fist was blackness.

He woke up, and saw a familiar face. It was a face that magically inserted live butterflies into his stomach.

“Are you okay?” the face said.

“It’s the little red head girl!” he exclaimed.

“Excuse me?”

“I mean -- I’m sorry -- Heather. It’s good to see you. What happened to Peppermint Patty?” Charlie Brown asked as Heather and Sally pulled him up by his hands. Sally walked and sat down to give her brother and Heather space to talk.

“She was escorted out,” said Heather, “but it was no trouble, because she said that she and Marcy had some protest to attend or something.”

Charlie Brown and Heather conversed for about fifteen minutes. They told each other of their lives and what they had done since high school. Charlie Brown had always been afraid of talking to her in elementary school because of his attraction to her, and in high school he managed to be friendly acquaintances with her, but that was as far as he ever got. Heather explained to Charlie Brown that an older boyfriend she had had gotten her into drugs and hedonistic celebrations. She dropped out of high school to run away from her life and travel cross-country with her boyfriend. She had become a free spirit only to end up on the gritty side of life. As the years went by, Heather had become pregnant, which put pressure on her boyfriend. Her boyfriend had been jailed because of a drunken rage that resulted in her miscarriage. She was alone now, living in an old apartment building in Chicago. Coincidentally, Chicago’s where Charlie Brown had been spending his adulthood.

“In all honesty, Charlie Brown, I had always wished you would have come up to me and asked me out.”

“I’m sorry, Heather. I always wanted to be there. But I never had faith in myself. All those years, I felt that the world was against me, and that my existence was nothing but a nuisance to others.”

“How do you feel about yourself now?”

“I feel… I feel good about myself. And I have to thank Linus. He was always encouraging me to have faith in myself and in the world. I wouldn’t be where I am now if it weren’t for all the advice he had been giving me since we were kids. He even gave me advice on how to approach you, but that was the one thing I never had faith in. It was beauty that I had always feared, and it was beauty that Linus had always celebrated.”

“Beauty?”

“Yes. It was my weakness. My weakness was you. But I’ve overcome that fear, and as I currently stare in the face of beauty at this very moment, I am a bit sad knowing that I had missed so many opportunities in my childhood to experience that joy that I had always dreamed about whenever I would see that beauty on the other side of that playground.”

Heather stood quiet, then stared into Charlie Brown’s eyes.

“Charlie Brown, for some reason, fate resulted in both of us living in the same city, and then brought us together to have this conversation right here in this chapel. I doubt that you’re dumb enough to miss the new opportunity that the universe has at last thrown at you.”

Charlie Brown then smiled. Heather smiled back. They sat down on a bench next to Lucy and Sally as Reverend Franklin gave his sermon. After the sermon, Pig Pen went up to the podium to give his short speech:

“Linus was a gift to us all. I remember the horrific time in my life when I became addicted to crystal meth. Everybody from my childhood grew up, and when I was on drugs, it sounded to me like they spoke nothing but loud incoherent noises. I was afraid that if I were grown up, perhaps my voice would also sound like some broken trombone. But Linus helped me overcome my fears, and convinced me to get help, and soon enough I was on my way to recovery. Today, I stand before you, clean and pure like Linus’ childhood innocence. We all remember how excited he would get on holidays. We all remember his crazy stories about the Great Pumpkin and the Easter Bunny.  And I know we all remember that time he told us all the meaning of Christmas, and then got us all to sing around that small tree. It was Linus who reminded us that all things in life including that tree deserve love. It was Linus to reminded us to have faith.”

At this point in the speech, Charlie Brown’s eyes filled with tears. Heather held on to his hand.

Pig Pen Continued:

“It is sad to see Linus gone from our lives, and for him, I wish that everyday was a holiday, but it was his wish for all of us to have faith in love. Happiness is love.”

After the speech, everybody at the funeral took their town to have their final moments with Linus’ body in his casket.

Charlie Brown stepped up to the coffin and took one last look at his childhood best friend. Linus lay there with his arms crossed on his chest. His face hadn’t changed a bit since Charlie Brown last saw him.  Charlie Brown shared his final words with Linus:

“Hey buddy. It’s been a long time. You know, I never got to thank you for what you did for me. All those years of you being by my side were the best moments of my life, no matter how much I complained about life. To tell you the truth, throughout my life, I never actually did discover the meaning of life, or the purpose of my existence. But instead, I discovered how precious all living things are, and how important it is to take chances. I would have never gotten where I am if I hadn’t taken chances, and I would have never seen how gorgeous the world can be hadn’t you been by best friend. I should have never left your side—“ He choked a little as he tried not to cry as he spoke. “What I discovered was how amazing life can be once you allow yourself to live it.”

Charlie Brown opened the satchel he had been carrying over his shoulder. He pulled out a small, light blue blanket. It was old, but still in good condition.

“I love you buddy. I hope you and Snoopy are having a great a time together,” Charlie Brown said as he tucked the blanket underneath Linus’ arms.

The only thing that remained the same since childhood was that we were always worthless. You see, me and Daryl and DaShawn are dirt poor.  Being poor is like being stuck in a hamster wheel that never stops, instead of exercise you get shunned by society and embarrassed for who you are.  Oh, and you cant get off this hamster wheel, it perpetuates from parent to child.  .. I guess the poor breed just to fill in the vacancies of the future poor population.

I quickly think of my brother and how disappointed in me he would be.  I promised I would never do this.  I promised I would apply to community college next year.  I promised I would get off pills.  That’s three empty promises… its not fair that he got to be so smart and got the scholarship while I’m here breaking promises.  I don’t think he let society define him as much as I did; it’s probably my low self-esteem.  But what other choice do I have at this point?  Daryl and DaShawn describe to me what we were told to do.  DaShawn pulls a glock out of his pants and brandishes it with a nervous smile over his head.  I feel trapped.  When we were children would any of us see this coming?  The possibilities seemed so limitless then, and now as I look at the gun we have to kill another human being with, I’m beginning to realize just how limited the possibilities really are.

little dog looked dazed and confused as they 

meandered about the perimeter of the grassy,

sloping dog park.

My dog approached them and I followed her but 

they moved along and farther away, both seeming 

to be in their own and yet separate worlds. He 

had earplugs connected to a device listening to 

music, or something else, taking him even further 

from where his feet actually were. The dog led the 

way, sniffing and snorting at the weeds with no 

particular direction.

What a pair.

The fenced-in corral is where people take their 

pets to exercise. It’s not large, so our paths 

invariably would cross as we meandered. Dog 

Parks are for people too, I've discovered.

My dog, Lacey, got nowhere with the pint-sized 

wanderer, his lower teeth and jaw clenched 

above his uppers. The dog’s eyes were glazed. 

The two small canines passed like ships in the 

night without the customary sniffing greeting: 

the handshake and smile, or frown, of the doggie 

world.

I raised my sunglasses above my head to make 

eye contact with the man with tired eyes. After 

all, dog parks are not just for dogs. People meet 

people there, and that’s nice. The light, cool mist 

and the damp ground were keeping away the 

regulars, so it was just the four of us on this late 

morning.

As we approached from opposite directions he 

removed his earplugs and looked up from the 

ground.  “He’s Alfie,” he whispered from his tired 

face.

“Excuse me? Good Morning.”

“Alfie. His name is Alfie.”

“Oh, that’s a great dog name. I like that. My dog is 

Lacey.”

Lacey is a fluffy white Pomapoo, a poodle mixed 

with a Pomeranian – or that’s what the sales 

guy told us when we paid a hundred bucks for 

her. She weighs about 20 pounds.

“His full name is Alfalfa but we call him Alfie. He’s 

a Bichon.”

Alfie was even smaller than Lacey and sort of 

runty. 

“Oh, like Alfalfa, The Little Rascal?”

“Yes – you see he has a bump on his head and 

that makes his hair stick up like Alfalfa’s cowlick.”

“Ha, yes I see that – his mark of distinction.”

“He ran away once and we put up posters and 

got a call. They said we think we found your dog. I 

asked them if he has a bump on his head and they 

said yes, so I said that’s Alfie, I’ll come get him.”

  Alfie’s owner’s speech was very dry.

“Well, he looks like a nice pet. He walks around 

and doesn’t bother anybody or other dogs.”

No response for a minute, then:

“He can’t be left alone.”

“What do you mean? “

“He goes crazy if we leave him in the house. He 

tears the place up. If we put him in a crate he 

chews that up and all the stuffing too.”

“Why not put him in a wire mesh one or plastic, 

that he can’t destroy?”

“We tried but then he hurts himself. He will chew 

out his toenails and bite his own legs. He has 

extreme separation anxiety. I think the bump on 

his head goes into his brain. My wife and I can’t 

leave him. If we go out for a few hours we never 

know what we’ll will find when we return.”

I could see now why the man looked so tired and 

withdrawn. This little dog was ruling his life, and 

he told me this has been going on for nine years. I 

could not imagine such a life.  A pet is for joy, or at 

least this is my take on it.

“We used to have a German Shepard but he died 

a few years back,"" he told me, “when we left 

him home with our Shepard, Alfie was OK and 

we could go out and he would be fine when we 

got back. But Shep died and now Alfie goes crazy 

again.”

I thought and thought … and I really felt bad 

for the guy. But after nine years of being 

held captive by Alfie’s dysfunction I assumed 

that every possible remedy must have been 

considered. He said they had consulted a number 

of veterinarians, and dog trainers, and even a dog 

shrink. Yet, his dilemma continued to nag at me 

the longer I listened to his tale of woe. While he 

spoke, I pondered, grasping for an original idea 

that had yet to be tried.

Then it came to me.

“Why don’t you get Alfie a cat? They are low 

maintenance and self managing and you said Alfie 

was OK with Shep the Shepard, so maybe any live

body will do?”

For the first time the man’s face changed from a 

sullen mask. His eye showed some life – and hope.

“You know, I never thought of that – that’s a great 

idea!”

His body moved briskly, with energy and he 

reached for Alfie’s leash that was hung on the 

fence near the water Guzzler.

“I think I’m going to go home now – I want to talk 

to my wife. Alfie, Alfie, c’mon boy, let’s go. Let's 

go see Mommy!”

I said goodbye and good luck, feeling pleased that 

maybe I did something to help this one person, 

this one day, in this one life.

Days went by and there was no sign of Alfie and 

the tired man.

A week passed and Lacey and I were there early 

when they finally arrived. The man was not 

wearing earplugs connecting him to a digital world 

and his shirt was neatly tucked in. He looked like 

he had gotten some sleep and a little sun tan,

maybe from a full round of golf.

He bounded right over to my sunny bench, Alfie in 

tow.

“Hey, how’s it going?” I greeted him.

“Listen – I’m glad I ran into you.”

“Me too. How’ve you been?”

“We got a cat – like you said – and Alfie is so 

happy and we can leave him home now – we even 

played a full round of golf yesterday. Gee, thanks 

a lot!”

“Not a problem. It was my pleasure. I like to think 

that there are no problems – only solutions. I’m 

glad it worked out.”

Alfie chased Lacey, and the now-not-quite-so-tired 

man bounded after one of the well-worn tennis 

balls that all dog owners like to chase – maybe 

even while meeting other people – at the dog

By the time he was 18 months old, Alex had taught himself how to read. At three years old he was playing piano and by four he was composing symphonies, études and concertos. By all measures, Alex Miner was a genius. He began studying mathematics after a particular day playing with blocks and learning Latin. He simultaneously learned the word *scientia* and, while stacking red blocks upon yellow blocks, realized that ideas could be stacked too. From that moment on, he began to consume math day and night, stopping only occasionally to eat and, when mulling over a particularly complex problem, to lay at the foot of his parent’s bed and stare at the ceiling.

In his small room in rural Nebraska, he pushed his mind to the furthest limits of known math and physics, and once he had learned everything there was to be taught, he invented. He was prone to wild fits of anger, dowsed by deep crevesas of depression and meloncoly. He won awards for his discoveries, as well as money. He won three million dollars alone for Millennium Prize problems, by solving the Riemann hypothesis, the Poincaré conjecture and the Hodge conjecture within a single year. There were even rumors of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences approaching the Nobel Foundation regarding a Nobel Prize in mathematics for his work. Without care for fame or fortune, or any of those things the child mind does not bother itself with, Alex twisted and turned down the rabbit hole of understanding, and anyone who knows rabbit holes knows there is not enough room to turn or look back.

Of all the interests this life has to offer, Alex only cared for two of them; Mathematics and numismatics. He was as fascinated by coins from all the old civilizations of the world as he was by geometric postulates. The imperial coinage of the Roman Empire depicting Brutus and Marc Antony, Celtic coins differentiated by tribe and region, the latter Byzantine coins of Alexius IV and Constantine XI, and old English hammered coins all struck him with great beauty and mystery.

When Alex was nine, he came to a problem he could not solve. The problem was not an old problem, since the language needed to ask it was created by Alex himself, but it was generally considered a hard problem by the mathematics community. This was the first time he had come to a puzzle in which he could not instantly solve, let alone solve at all. Day after day he lay at the foot of his parents bed, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, daydreaming of numbers.

	
When Alex was ten, doctors found the first tumor. He was undergoing some routine checkups at the local hospital, and a few men from the university wanted to do a brain scan for their research. These types of scans were not uncommon, ever since his work in the field of quantum physics got the attention of academia, Alex was obliged to let doctors and specialists take photos of his miraculous brain. Top neuroscientists and cognitive researchers would fly into Lincoln Airport to meet with him, always leaving with a look of excitement on their faces as they went to begin their study of his head. At first it was just a small black smudge on the xrays, but the tumor grew and multiplied rapidly. More tumors grew over the course of a few months, and as his eleventh birthday grew near, Alex’s frontal lobe was irreversibly full of black smudges on grainy white photo paper.

His physical brain was of no concern to him though. As long as his mind worked long enough to solve this problem, the problem that had made him set up a bed of blankets and pillows at the foot of his parents bed, he would be happy. While not in the blanket bed, Alex researched old coins and talked about collecting on a website he found called The New Mismatists. He let his concerns and thoughts slip away while he lost himself in Greek and Roman provincial coins, talking to other collectors and amateurs about this nuance or that. He started his own site shortly after and called it Charta Numus.

While Alex’s website thrived with coin collectors and enthusiasts, his health began to fail. His energy was gone and he could barely bring himself to get out of bed in the morning.

“I need to go into space.” He said one morning at the breakfast table.

“Why do you need to go into space dear?” Asked his mother.

“I’ve come to the end of my research, I can only do the last part in space.”

“Space is quite a long ways away, and you need your rest.”

“I’ve already decided, and I’m going in three months.”

His father spoke up, “Son, you can’t just go to space, it takes a lot of training to get ready for something like that. Besides, it is very expensive, I think it costs more money than you have.”

“I have a plan, don’t worry.” Alex said.

His parents looked at eachother, then back to their dinner.

Alex worked furiously. He sent emails to scientists, engineers and doctors around the globe. A community of supporters sprung up on his website Charta Numus, donating to his project by sending him a dollar if he in turn would think of them when he was out there. After three months, he was ready.

---

“I’m going into space tomorrow.” Alex said to his parents at the dinner table.

The looked at each other incredulously. “Honey, are you sure about this?” His mom asked.

“Yes, I’m sure, I have to do it. There are fringe elements of dissent regarding the Miner Henley Mandelbrot proposition. However, both Bromley’s camp and Drell’s camp have come around on the specific plausibilities. There is virtually no substantial counter-arguments left. I...” He stopped. 

“Mom, the Russians are sending someone up to do this next week, and china is going to do it next weekend. I know I probably won’t make it back, but I want to do this more than anything I've ever wanted. I have a list of doctors here you can ask anything, I can make the launch and return flight. Dad, no one has ever done this experiment before, and this is my last chance to, I have to go.” 

His mom cried, his father did the dishes, and Alex spend his last night on earth in a pillow fort at the end of his parents bed, thinking about earth.

The launch was more terrifying than people had told him it would be. There was a beauty in the terror though, to let go of all the fear and experience the magnificent roar of the rockets just feet away outside of the capsule. Once outside of the atmosphere and Earth’s gravitational hug, his body lifted up out of the seat and he was alone in the black sea of space. He thought for a good while sitting in his restraints. He was completely alone.

“Alex, this is control, do you copy?”

“Kennedy, this is Alex.”

“We’ve got someone on the line for you, they say they’re from Nebraska, do you want to take it?”

“Of course.”

“They are on now.”

“Honey?” The voice of his mom came with static over the intercom.

“Hi mom, I don’t have much time but I wanted to tell you I solved that problem I couldn’t figure out.” Alex said.

“Oh that is wonderful dear, I’m so proud of you, we are both so proud of you. Your father is here, would you like to speak to him?”

“Yeah , I love you mom.”

“Son?” His father's voice came through faintly.

“Hi dad, I figured it out.”

“I’m so proud of you son, I can’t wait to see it.”

“You will, but I won't be able to show it to you, I love you dad.” Alex said.

The conversation lasted a little while longer, then Alex was alone again.

The ship automatically re-entered the atmosphere at its set time, and the recovery crew fished Alex’s capsule out of the sea. His final thoughts were recorded in his journal, where he had sprawling notes and numbers. At the end of the journal was a paragraph long theorem that was circled and noted ‘This is it’. On the very last page there was a drawing of a coin and a note below it saying, “I’m thinking of all of you right now, charta numus.” Charta Numus, paper coin.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1j2ztc,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j2ztc/charta_numus_paper_coin/,

I don't know why I came here in the first place, or why I've stayed so long. It was initially my parents' idea, they wanted a change in their lives, so they brought me and my sister out  here when we were very young. My parents left about 10 years ago, and I didn't mind that much, they were getting pretty annoying being around every day. My sister stuck around a while after our parents left, but she couldn't take being here without our parents, something about it feeling different without them here, so she bought a ticket out. I can't really blame her, albeit I do miss her sometimes, I think she made the right choice. There wasn't much going for her here anyways. She was the only one that made things here tolerable though. I haven't really been able to contact her since she left a few years ago, and often wonder how she is doing. She was the only one that got me here, we would always go places together and just poke fun at the mindlessness of everyone else. None of them knew what they were doing, and neither did we. But at least we didn't pretend we did know and that we were having a great time doing it. We could spend days together just doing nothing, and nobody else understood. I've just been going through the motions since she left, and I've been getting quite bored of the repetition. I decided it was time for a change and that I was going to follow my sister's suit and buy my ticket out as well. It was really expensive, but I think it will be worth it. I'm not even going to put in my two weeks at work, my sister and I will have a good laugh about that later.

I can't remember it quite clearly, but I remember the flames. The burning, the pain, the raw seething hatred, I knew where I was, but I would never wish to admit it. I believe that I had fallen into the depths of hell. I remember struggling against the pull of millions of blood covered and death ridden arms and limbs of unknown kind grasping onto me, as if their very being depended on it. I remember as I awoke I felt as if I was being yanked out of that horrid wasteland. But it is time I chronicle my life since that point. I have been to such far away lands you could never imagine the horrid sites, and the impossible beauties I have seen along my way. I have seen everything from murderous creatures with strange tentacled maws, and wingspans befitting only the largest of mythical beings to sunsets in marvelous shades of blue with hints of red enough only to barely be seen. I have heard languages not of this earth, nay, not of this realm. I can only imagine what other finds lie out before me, in this magnificent of all worlds. Where I have come to know The Ximren Universe.

I am Professor Delphinius S. Tucker, the sole professor of Religious studies and history at a small university on an island off the coast of New England, well, I was the sole professor of Religious studies and history, but I doubt they have kept my position for me. I was taught at Cambridge and raised a citizen of Her Majesty Queen Victoria's Empire. When I was born, the world was nothing as it is today. As it was, technology was at a low point, the steam engine was being redesigned to hold more power, and exert more force. It was a sad time in human history, pollution was high, and technological development was almost at a stand still with the world focused on production of a better steam engine. On the year of my fourteenth birthday my father went off to war. It was with the news of his death that I devoted my life to creating technology for the whole world. Technology that could better man kind, and could lead to peaceful use only. I learned the hard way that any design could be used as a weapon. When I was fifteen I created my first large scale invention: an underwater ship. I called it a submarination steam æthership. I sold the patents to the Royal British Navy and was instantly funded and given a proper laboratory. I could not have been happier.

By the time I was 18 my life was one of luxury and enjoyment. I had finished my underschooling in the metropolis of London, and was on my way to Cambridge. Although I had mostly only learned of mechanics, chemistry, and the other sciences, my mind took a different focus for my upperschooling: Religion, philosophy and history. Something had always interested me in the past, and I was intrigued when studying Da Vinci that I decided to learn of what marvels and technologies had been hidden out of human eye for many years. It was during these years that I brought forth my most famous inventions. I invented underwater ships so massive that scores of men could live for years underneath the sea to study the marvels of the depths. I invented ships of similar design that could even exist outside the atmosphere of the earth, studying the stars in the very sky above our heads. With each invention my aspirations grew and grew. It was only a matter of time before I began to undertake the invention that would bring me to the place I am now: The Transdimensional Ætherportal.

However, I was only 22 at the time I ended my final schooling. In learning Religion and History, with a touch of philosophy, you learn a lot about many languages other than English. I am still thankful for that, as those studies have made it easier to communicate with the strange species I have come to meet. Alas, I am getting sidetracked. I was only 22 at the time I ended my schooling, and I was not quite ready to risk the world to see other dimensions. I had finished my Transdimensional Ætherportal only a year earlier and still was running stability tests on the portal itself. I began to look for one who would become my bride. It was three months later that I found her, Abigail Williams. She and I fit together perfectly. For weeks I was madly in love with her. We had dinner and had gone to the theater on many occasions. We spent every waking moment together. Three months after the day we met, to the day, I asked her to be my bride.

She accepted through teary eyes. A month later she went on holiday to visit her mother and prepare for our wedding day. It was a week after she left that I received a letter in the post. It was from the coroner in Pensburry. My dearest Abigail had been killed by an unknown man. There had been no witnesses and the Constibul was attempting to do everything he could to find the killer. I knew enough at the time to realise there would be no hope in finding the killer. It was then that I gathered my things and made passage across the Atlantic. I was going to start a new life in America. I booked an airship from London that would be sufficient to carry my belongings. The Royal Navy expressed it's disapproval of my leaving, however as I was a civilian they could not hold me back. One of my previous Professors arranged for me to have the entire airship.

As I watched London, and then Mother England, and then the continent of Europe float away, I knew that my life was taking a turn for the better as I felt sure that I would be able to start an entirely new life where I was going. I began preparing my opening lecture for my new class. I had been guaranteed a spot as the Professor of Religious Studies and History at a small university called Wesleyan. I decided to open my Religious studies class with a lecture on the concept of God. I was going to open them up to the idea that different cultures had different Gods, and these belief contradictions were the cause of many conflicts over the ages. Little did I know that I would never get to deliver this lecture. It was then, on that airship, that I decided to run one final test on my Transdimensional Ætherportal.

I moved to the cargo area of the ship and removed the portal’s canvas cover. The large brass apparatus towered over me. The overall spherical shape at first had unnerved me during its creation, but I grew to appreciate its beauty. I moved to the knob riddled control panel and began to activate the portal. A light began to emanate from the four arms that contoured to the outer shape of the sphere. They began to spin rapidly. As the arms spun the light covered the large brass and copper mesh sphere. The whole portal began to glow with a deep purple light. I pushed the button on the control panel that directed a series of arms with focusing-glasses on the end between me and the sphere. It was as if I was moving from the subconscious. As though my body was acting on a force greater than myself, but I was strangely comfortable with it all. As the light began to engulf my body, I realised what I had done. I had activated the portal.

I can't remember it quite clearly, but I remember the flames. The burning, the pain, the raw seething hatred, I knew where I was, but I would never wish to admit it. I believe that I had fallen into the depths of hell. I remember struggling against the pull of millions of blood covered and death ridden arms and limbs of unknown kind grasping onto me, as if their very being depended on it. I remember as I awoke I felt as if I was being yanked out of that horrid wasteland. I stood and rubbed my head. I looked around, I was still on the airship, but there was something different about it. The light had changed to being a white hue, as normal light is, to being a strange off white color. As if the properties of infrared light had somehow entered into my view. I could see my pilot looking around frantically through the thin skin of the aircraft. I could not, however explain how I saw him. His image was as though he were a silhouette on a screen. But I knew it was indeed him. I went to him, and saw him with the same look that I imagined was on my face, one of both intrigue and fear.

I told him to land the ship in a field of the most marvelously red grass. I told him that a strange adventure was soon to begin, and I would need to explain a few things to him before we continued. He landed the ship, stood up and turned to face me.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1j14y0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j14y0/the_ximren_chronicles_introduction/,

There were none of the usual aches and pains that I felt sometimes, and my mind was oddly clear. I figured that I might as well take advantage of my peculiar situation, so I reached over to my nightstand and tried to pick up my iPad so I could read the morning news. Then I saw my hand.

I leapt out of the bed, recoiling in terror. Only too late did I realize that I had never hit the ground. Eyes wide, I chanced a look down. Instead of the familiar confines of my tiny bedroom, I saw the floor of the apartment above mine. My right leg was floating half in, half out of the brown-speckled tile, and I was further surprised to see it whole. I had lost it below the knee in combat ten years ago, but it was all there, despite the fact that I could feel none of it. I testily moved the limb, and it silently emerged from the floor. I was forced to stifle another shout of alarm when, out of the corner of my left eye, I saw the occupant of the apartment. She was sleeping, her slight back to me. I tried to stand, only to find that I slowly floated upwards. Desperately, I stared at the floor, and I sank down, landing silently. I couldn't help it. Before I realized what I was doing, I grunted in satisfaction at my minor accomplishment. Horrified, I literally melted into the wall. I could still see inside, however, and noticed that the woman hadn’t even stirred, and was still sleeping soundly. Emboldened, I stepped back into the apartment. I cleared my throat, and said, “Oi! Can you here me?” The woman continued sleeping. “Hey!” I practically shouted, growing more terrified. Nothing happened. I impulsively stepped towards the bed, reaching for the woman’s shoulder. My hand went straight through. I pulled it away, and fell back into the floor. With a silent flash, everything went white.

I opened my eyes, and found myself in the basement of my building. I tried to stand, but once again, I floated through the ceiling. The floor above was the lobby, and I came up just in front of the reception desk. I expected the people in the lobby to recoil at the sight of my scarred visage appearing from the floor, but no one seemed to notice me. This was starting to seem like a trend, so I began to walk towards the door. I found that, if I concentrated, I could prevent myself from falling through. I stepped right through the glass doors, flinching as my feet hit the sidewalk. It was then that I realized that I was dressed in nothing but my boxers. While I seemed to be invisible, my embarrassment won out and I decided to return to my room. I turned to face the building, and jumped.

I flew up much faster than I had earlier. My apartment was on the ninth floor, and I reached its window within a second. I reached out and grabbed the balcony, my hand passing right through a potted plant. Focusing, I was able to stand on the cracked concrete and look through my window. I walked through the screened glass door into my small kitchen. I went into my room via the wall, and noticed that I was lying on the bed. I looked surprisingly serene, but the fact remained that my dead body was lying less than ten feet in front of me, and I was standing there looking at it. I took the news that I was dead pretty well, considering the circumstances. Death had been around the corner for me since I joined the Service, and I was almost glad that I had gone while I was sleeping peacefully, as opposed to, perhaps, having a knife shoved through my gut. I turned, shrugged my shoulders, and opened my closet. I grabbed a pair of jeans, a black t-shirt, and a leather jacket and found that, as I put them on, they became translucent, allowing me to see the floor through the fabric. I walked over to my nightstand and pocketed my phone, wallet, and pocketknife. I took one last look at my apartment, and then I jumped through the ceiling and left.

I came out on the roof, squinting in the morning Los Angeles sunlight. The view from my building’s roof was spectacular, with the Pacific Ocean easily visible on the horizon. The wind was blowing, but I didn’t feel it like I normally would. The air passed through me, leaving behind only the soft feeling of a light breeze. The smog, normally the most dominant smell in the air, was even worse than average. I decided to get away from it, and jumped again. The roof of the building receded in a flash, and I was above the clouds. I threw my arms apart, slowing my upward momentum and eventually stopping me. I looked down, and could see the entire city. The cars on the 101 were like ants, crawling along with the speed of molasses. The Port was bustling, with enormous container ships plying the shining blue carpet that was the water. I could see LAX, with what looked like toy planes taking off, landing, and disgorging their human cargo into the airport. As I gazed out over the great city, I heard approaching engines. I whipped my head around, and saw the blue nose of an airliner hit me in the chest. 

I shot downward, but it was too late. I phased through the plane’s aluminum skin and entered the cargo compartment. I focused on stopping my tumble, and forced my hand to grab onto a navy-blue suitcase. Having slowed down sufficiently, I let go of the suitcase, and sat on the floor of the plane. Despite the air moving past at 500 miles per hour just inches from my rear end, I felt nothing. Despite my long career in the field of clandestine operations, I had somehow never found myself in the cargo compartment of any passenger jet, much less a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737. I figured that, seeing as I was dead, I could afford to get away from things a little. I settled in between a bulkhead and some odd-smelling luggage, concentrated on not falling through the plane, and wondered where I was flying off to.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1374779435.0,,,True,t3_1j0hpr,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j0hpr/a_slightlydifferent_morning/,

Let me know what you think, whether it's that they're dumb, you love them, or meh. Thanks =] 

I have a link for an epub version and a pdf version. Also I have a blogger page with all of them. I'm posting the second story here, to give you a sample. It's the shortest one, all the others are about a page and a half, and there's 5 total (as of now).

The pdf is a little nicer, as I've never actually made an epub, but I looked it over on my nook and it's readable, the text is a little big like a childrens book, but it comes with a cover which the pdf does not  (it's really just a picture I drew of Bean-Man lol).

and here's the second story, titled Keys.

This adventure takes place, once again, within the home of Super-Idiot Bean-Man and his equally Aggravating sidekick Gerbil Lady. Actually I’m lying. It actually takes place somewhere a little bit south of their house, so we’ll start there.

“Give me the keys!” shouted Bean-Man.

“No! You’re just going to go home!” Gerbil Lady shouted back.

“I will not, just give me the keys! I feel naked without them,” revealed Bean-Man.

“You are naked!” Revealed Gerbil Lady.

“That’s beside the point!” Bean-Man sighed. “Just give me the keys, and we’ll go on your little adventure”

“You promise?”

“I promise.” Bean-Man promised.

“You promise we’ll search for rainbows? And, and, solve modern mysteries?! I’ve always wanted to do that! We can travel the world! Making it a safer place for everyone! We hold the key to everyone’s happiness! We could even do freeze-frame high fives after! Do you promise?” Gerbil Lady said with oh so much hopefulness in her eyes.

“No. I’m going home.” Bean-Man replied as he swiped the keys out of Gerbil Lady’s hands.

I could try to defend my actions, tell you why this is not the case, but I fear you would not believe me. You don’t see the world how I see it, you don’t understand what needs to be done. Your world is what you see around you, your neighbours, your postman, the waitress at the bar you visited that one time on holiday. You think of the world as countries, places, people. It is this view that prevents you from seeing what I see. And unfortunately it is a view shared by the vast majority of our species.”

“Try me. You act as though you are a saviour to mankind. Messiah come down to save our mortal souls.”

“Save you? I’m not here to save you. I do not deny what I have done, what I plan to do, will cause loss of life. I will even concede it may cause a large number of deaths. This however, is irrelevant. I am no messiah, no saviour. I am however, a necessary part of the future.”

“Careful Mr. Thomas, you’re in danger of descending into a bond villain.”

“Please.” Thomas said with an indignant smile. “I would think such comparisons are a touch naive. I am not pure evil, diluted down to the basest elements of my personality, so audiences know to hate me. No. I, like you and every other sane person on this planet, am a combination of good of evil; a moral cocktail, made of a mixture of ideals, beliefs, thoughts, both moral and immoral. I simply choose to embrace the side of myself, most would rather leave dormant and unused, fearing the consequences of tipping their ‘moral compasses’ too far into the red.”

“You say you are not evil, yet you do not deny intentionally killing millions of people?” Francis slapped the table quietly.

“You would not call mother nature evil would you? Or the bacteria responsible for disease? Just because something is responsible for many deaths does not make it evil. Our race kill hundreds of millions of other species every year, would you call yourself evil?”

“You compare yourself to a force of nature?”

“I am not so vain as to make comparisons like that. I only mean to demonstrate that causing death does not constitute evil. However, I may indulge in comparison this once to show you the benefit of my work. That said I would not compare myself, rather our works. I am a necessary step in our progression. I am doing what needs to be done to move our species forward.”

“Evolutionary process? Move our species forward? And you aim to do this by killing millions?”

“Those deaths are an unfortunate, unavoidable consequence of what needs to be done. They are a means to an end. It is not through the death of any one person, or group of people that this can be achieved. Only through the unfortunate suffering of many, through the conflict causing such suffering can we achieve our next step.”

“Thomas, war is never necessary. It can’t, shouldn't be. There are other ways. No matter what your master plan for the continuation of mankind is it cannot be necessary to cause the outbreak of another war.”

“No Mr. Kelly, there is no other way. War is the catalyst we need to trigger the next great step in our advancement, technologically, socially, economically. The vast majority of humanities great leaps happened during times of strife. War is our greatest tool in the drive forward, conflict our greatest teacher; A stimulus for the true advancement of our race. Only when there is a clear enemy, when people recognise that their lives are in danger if something is not done, will people accept what has to be done. They will rally together, endure economic rationing, and push harder for the technological advances they can use to win their war. That is where the real prize comes from. Our weaponry is what fuels the rest of the world. Man develops a new kind of weapon, and then that technology is adapted and used in other walks of life.”

“We do not need war to innovate and develop. Look at the last 100 years, we have practically lived with worldwide peace the entire time, with some outstanding innovations and technological advancements. Look at how far medicine has come, how much the world has changed with the advent of molecular transference. Not to mention finally sequencing the human genome, and all the possibilities coming from that. Is this not proof enough of our ability to push without conflict?”

“Medicine has stalled. You know that as well as I do. We have reached as far as we can with what we have. We need something new. And I wouldn’t count finishing a project started during the cold war as a victory for non conflict inspired thought. While I will give you the development of molecular transference as a good step forward, its implementation has been lazy. It was developed to be used as people expected, but where is the innovation now? Where are the uses that blow your mind? The uses no one saw coming? Give a technology like that to war time engineers and watch as it explodes into one of the greatest technologies ever created. We might still be creating, still innovating, we might even have the right people in place to make things happen, but at the minute they are handicapped. Kept on a shoestring in order to allow Johnny somebody out there to have a second home, buy a car for his daughter on her birthday, and retire early to a life more comfortable than 3 generations previous could’ve dreamed of. I mean to create an incubator for these kinds of ideas. When I succeed, and I will, you will see funding pour into laboratories around the world, each side vying to claim the next great discovery for themselves. The scientists and engineers around the world will have the freedom to try anything in pursuit of the perfect weapon. And when they find it, the war will end, and there will no longer be a need for a perfect weapon. They will find new ways to adapt their weapon to the new world, find ways to help the world. This is my goal.”

“Again you claim to help the world. And yet you desire the destruction of its inhabitants? You don’t want to help the world, you aim to destroy it. You are a monster.”

“Please Francis, try not to let your emotions run away with you.  I am no more a monster than you are. I give to the charities, and help the old ladies just like everyone else, I do not want to cause any unnecessary deaths. I cannot say the same about necessary ones. And I would hate for yours to become necessary. You need to return to your home, to your wife, and forget about your attempts to change my mind. I’m afraid it is a fool’s errand.”

With that, he got up and walked for the door, stopping only to hold the door for a woman carrying a small child. Francis watched him go. 

*“Maybe he’s right” He thought. “Maybe I should just go home. I don’t know how to stop him. I know Kate thinks I’m paranoid, but he has just admitted to everything. I know now what he plans to do. But what do I do with that information? I don’t know how to stop him. I don’t even know how exactly he plans to do it. He has the ear of the right people. He can do it. I’m sure of it.”*

Francis got up and headed for the door. Outside he turned left. He didn't have a destination in mind. He just needed to think.

*“I can’t let him get away it. There must be something I can do. Someone I can talk to. I can’t just go to the police. Not yet. What would I tell them? Help, my neighbour wants to start a war? They’ll lock me up! No. I need some kind of proof.”* 

He stopped outside a hardware store. He went in and bought a flash light, screwdriver, a padlock, and a bolt cutter. 

*“For all the technologies, and advancements, sometimes old methods are best.”* He thought. Then he went home.

I heard a story the other day, fucking breaks my heart. Some old broad kicked it in her apartment. Took three days for anyone to notice. Where the hell do we live that some sweet old granny can die and no one cares enough to check. There’s this lady who lives in my apartment building, name's like Gladys or something. Got to be seventy. Never gets any visitors, no one helps her with her groceries or holds the door for her in the morning. It’s a crying shame, she could die and no one would care. It would be like she never existed at all. So I was feeling bad for her and all so I offered to help her with her groceries. She said no. So I figure that she’s just not used to talking to people, so every week I offer and she keeps saying no.

All I’m trying to do is make it so that when she dies at least she’ll know one person will notice. Well one day I’ve had it and I stand in her doorway until she gets off the elevator. She tries to get past but I grab her groceries and won’t give them back until she opens the door and lets me take them inside. She tries to fight me but I take the key off of her and open the door. 

Turns out Gladys was running one of the biggest counterfeiting operations in the United States. Right out of her apartment. She called me Kenny when she waved me goodbye and that’s not my name. Hell it’s not that hard, my name's right there on my work shirt. I’ll remember her that’s for sure. I think I’ll take the 50 Gs she gave me and buy a nice girl for the night, tell her I’ll give it all to her if she just guesses my name.

    It's hard to believe that there was ever a time when my life had been empty. Ever since birth my wall has been filling up and I've been followed by tons of people. I'm 16 now, and I live like everyone else. I go to school with all the others. We learn grammar and spelling, but really they might as well teach us another language because these things do not matter. Who says ""you"" or ""I have to go."" Stupid teachers, they just don't understand. 
   Life is simple. It's basically a game. You fit in and develop a certain part of yourself to appeal to others. The more appealing, the more followers. And followers is equal to popularity. Susie ""CrayCray"" Johnson has a pack of people following her all the time. She's practically a god. She talks to them all the time, she practically does nothing else. ""You won't believe what this boy did today!"" and ""OMG you just have to try this."" I honestly don't believe she's ever talked to a boy or tried anything. I myself have a decent following, but I can never find the time to talk to them, nor do I try to. They are mostly consisted of my friends and then the occasional random person. But it's ok, I'm never alone. They're always just a few steps behind me wherever I go. 
   With the Followed there is also the Unfollowed. Johnny McGuire is one of these unpopular scums of society. He's a poker, hence he has no followers. He doesn't even attempt to have followers. He just sits in place, poking at each passerby. He gets the occasional poke back and has a few friends. Other than that he kinda just...is. He's just there looking around. What a weirdo.
   School. A bombardment of educational videos. I swear half the stuff they are telling us isn't even true. There was a time when there were no followers? Pssh yeah right. These people probably think we're stupid. They try to tell us ""You're spelling it wrong"" or ""That doesn't even make sense."" I think they are wrong. Why should we make things harder on ourselves. Life is supposed to be easy right?
   Everyday I come home, walk into my room, hang a quick left and check my wall for the scribbles and chicken scratch of the day. Friends, strangers, aquaintences, well really they're all my friends, have all left messages for me. I sort through it finding the blaring red ads and viruses and erasing those. Can't have those in my timeline, don't want an impure record of my life. I also have to keep my wall clean for the stalkers. These mega-users are looked up to throughout the world. They have millions of friends and it's their job to sort through everyone's walls, feeds, and photos. It's truly an honor to be a stalker. And yet, they are not the highest ranking citizens in the world. Above them are the likers. These elite beings act as moderators and judges for our lives. The take into account all the different aspects of life, and whenever they feel someone deserves it, they award them a like. I myself have racked up about 600 likes so far in my life. Nowhere near Susie but got about 601 more than Johnny. 
   I guess I should be honest though. I make about three new friends a day and add a follower every two days or so. I'm decent, but not amazing. People laugh at me. They think I'm not cool. Apparently I don't live deep enough. I don't talk to my followers enough. I don't update my friends on what I'm doing or update my timeline enough. I don't post pictures up on the public feed enough. They consider me a ""skimmer."" I scratch the surface. I don't delve deeply into the inner workings of life enough. I try, but I can't. I'd rather talk to myself than my followers. I guess I'm just weird. 
   I go to sleep, wake up, school. Go to sleep, wake up, school. Go to sleep, wake up, school. It's life. What else is there. I'm happy, aren't I?
    I wake up one morning. I'm sitting in my room, is it mine? I see no writing on my wall, no pictures or words or any such thing on my feed. I had no followers. But I feel something different. Life has changed. I walk, and I feel different. I open my door and step through. A bombardment of senses hits me and I feel like I never have before. I SMELL then scents in the air, so intricate and airy . I HEAR the noises, a bird, a stream, the wind. I TASTE the sweet taste of springtime it seems for the first time. I FEEL the sun beating down on my skin and the grass underneath my feet as I tread towards a group of people. I SEE things. I've seen pictures posted on walls, but this, this was the most vivid picture I have ever witnessed. I thought I knew. I thought I knew what living was, but this, this is different. I have no followers, no friends, nobody. I am not alone though. Before, I was alone. I was connected to people, but I didn't KNOW them. In fact, I didn't know anything. I approach the group of people. They turn, they look, and I can see in their eyes that they have SEEN for longer than I. A man steps out, spreads his arms wide and speaks, ""Welcome to life.""

I wanted to trace them, slowly...perhaps with my fingers; perhaps with my own lips. I couldn't quite decide.

I spotted him midway through the show. The band had a Rockabilly vibe and he was the only other person moving to the beat in the tiny space. It was, after all, a local pub with no dance floor. He didn't have a lot of dance moves, but I could tell he loved the music. We smiled at each other and quickly looked away, but our feet kept leading us closer together. Finally, there was only a rough looking Biker between us, covered in piercings. I took a deep breath, placed my hands on the leather-clad gentleman's shoulders, and whispered tantalizingly in his right ear...""Sweetheart, I'm sorry, but you're the only thing between me and the man who's dancing. I'm going to move you over a bit."" 

And I did just that, guiding the slightly confused guy out of the way, as I slid up next to the man with the shy smile. The band played on, sweat dripping and beer chugging; singing about heartbreak and sex and beautiful women. We danced, bumped into people, made room for ourselves--we twisted and stomped and cheered until our voices were raw and feet sore. ""Can I buy you a drink?"" he asked with an accent, during a brief pause from the band. ""Well, I..."" I looked up at his face, at his smile, noticing the laugh lines. ""Sure. I'll have whatever you're having."" He ducked off while I tried to place it. Aussie, maybe? 

He returned a minute later, empty handed. ""They won't serve me! They think I've had enough."" Though he didn't seem that inebriated to me, I started to laugh. He looked puzzled. ""It's your accent! They think you're worse off than you are!"" He groaned and we both shrugged and turned our attention back to the music. Back to the beat, back to the rhythm. We danced in tandem but we didn't touch, not even once.

At the end of the show the singer threw his arms around me. ""I'm sorry, I'm so sweaty!"" I didn't mind. He was giddy, he had thrown all of his joy into that hug, and he released me with the biggest grin on his face. ""You boys were fantastic tonight. I'm so glad I came."" I hugged the bass player and said my goodnights, while the band had another beer. 

Outside, my new friend asked if there was somewhere else we could get a drink. ""There's an Irish pub a couple blocks down."" I gave him a sideways glance. ""Maybe I should order for us."" He laughed with me and we headed out. At the pub, I tried to figure out when and how to say what I needed to. I didn't want him to waste his money on buying me drinks, only to be disappointed. In the end I just kinda blurted it out--""I am in a bit of a different relationship situation. I am married, but we see other people...I don't do one night stands, though."" He shrugged. ""Eh, I'm not sure how to pick up girls, anyway."" He was an engineer, though what he really wanted was to be a helicopter pilot. He was in town for work and only had one night to live it up. ""I still want to dance! Do you know any nightclubs?"" 

I took him to the gay bar. It was the nearest place I could think of with a dance floor still going. ""You don't mind, do you?"" I asked while he took my hand. ""Nah. Gay people are pretty good dancers. Is this okay...?"" He squeezed my hand lightly. ""Yeah, I think so. It's nice."" He nodded. Our steps were a little uneven as the alcohol made its way through our limbs. 

""So,"" he said, pausing a little. ""If you aren't planning on having sex with me, do you think you could be my wing woman?"" I laughed. ""Of course.""

At the club, we made our way out on the floor and moved and grooved to the awful music. The alcohol made us care a little less about the lyrics and we just followed the beat. We still didn't touch, except the accidental bumps when someone else crashed into us. I nodded towards the pole at the side of the dance floor. ""You know, I broke my arm here once."" He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his eyes crinkled as he grinned, taunting me a little. ""Well, you should get back on the horse then, yeah?"" ""Yeah, perhaps.""

I jumped up, closed my eyes, and moved through two more songs, not daring to look at him. When I came back down he whispered to me ""Well, you've got some moves."" We had another drink and he looked over the crowd. ""I feel bad about chatting someone else up; I'm here with you!"" ""Go, silly, I brought you here to have a good time. Do what you want to do.""

""Well, mostly, I want to do you.""

""...Okay, not that. Go on now."" I shooed him away, laughing. He talked and danced with a few girls before returning to me. ""She just asked me straight up if I'd like a fuck."" He motioned to a pretty blonde across the floor. ""Oh. That's rather direct. Well then?"" ""I turned her down."" He smiled. I smiled. We danced some more.

When our feet would no longer hold us and I was sure my lungs would burst, we sat on a couch in the corner. ""So....what about kissing?"" he inquired, as we were close together and comfortable. ""Kissing is not a one night stand, is it?"" I paused. ""I...I don't really know!"" ""Well it's your rules, silly, what do you mean you don't know?"" 

His kisses were gentle and warm. I pulled back, blushing. He leaned in again, and I kissed him on the nose and dashed back to the dance floor. He followed. We had one more dance left in us. This time, we moved in close, and I slid my arm around his neck briefly. We moved together--slightly apart, but I could feel the warmth of his chest. Then the song was over, and we pulled away. 

Outside, I told him we had two options. ""We can go find some food, or part ways here."" ""Food!"" After some discussion, however, we realized that our only option that late was ordering from the 24 hour pizza place. ""We could order to my room...?"" He was so hopeful. ""Not happening, my dear."" ""Well, you can't fault me for trying,"" he said sheepishly. I couldn't. I probably would have enjoyed the one night with him, but it really wasn't my thing. I called him a cab and said I could walk home from there, as my house wasn't far. ""Will you be alright, though?""

""Probably!""

The walk took me a half hour. I met others on the way, with calls of ""Pretty lady!"" and ""Where's the party?"" but I made it home fine, of course. I texted him to let him know I made it, and he replied in kind. The next morning we each texted once to say thanks for the company and we had had a good time. He was the last to text and I left it at that, smiling.

Two days later, I received one more text from him.

""Hi, good meeting you and all the very best, but I would appreciate not texting me as I am with someone and she would not like me getting texts from strange women. I hope you can understand, take care and look after yourself, me.""

“Where am I?” I thought. “Am I dead?”

I sat up and looked around. I felt strangely light headed but not in an uncomfortable way. It felt like I was flying.
When my eyes adjusted to the brightness I saw a figure approaching me. I felt no fear but more of rejoice, like seeing an old friend after a long time.

I stood up, but fell backwards; only to find a stool behind me, in which I sat. When the figure got closer I saw it was a man. His skin was somewhat of a mixture of white, brown and black, I couldn't figure out the colour.
As he came closer he started to speak. I had never heard the language but I somehow recognized it. To my amazement I could understand it. He was speaking towards me, but not to me. What he said was beautiful. He said “Come here my child, for you have nothing to fear with Me. Walk along side Me and you will never feel the need of anything ever again.”

When the man was close enough I stood up. At that moment he was within five meters of me. I asked him “Where are we?” And he answered “We are where you want us to be. We can be anywhere.” I looked around for the second time and my heart nearly skipped a beat; we were in my childhood home, in the living room.
The man sat down and so did I. 

After a short while I asked him “Are you God?” 

“Yes.” He answered. 

“But if you are God then I must be dead.” 

“Must you?” He asked. “For you to be dead you had to be living at some point.” 

“Are you saying I don’t exist?”

“No. On the contrary; you are the only one that exists.”

“What are you saying?”

“I am saying that you are the only human being in the world.”

I did not quite understand what he was talking about and he must have realized that because he said. “You are the only man in the world and every other human is your imagination. What I am telling you now I have told you countless of times.”

I started to get very confused and felt a headache coming. “Just to get this straight; I am not dead because I was never alive, I am the only man and everything else is my imagination and you have told me this before? How come I can’t remember it then?”

God signed and pointed to the door. “When you walk through that door you will be born again. You will know everything from all your past ‘lives’ but not remember anything from them.”

“What is the point in this?”

“The point is very simple; when you have lived through everything you will know everything and then you will become God.”

“So I will replace you?”

“Correct.”

“And the only thing I have to do is walk through that door?” I pointed at the door and felt a small shiver lead up my spine.

“Also correct.”

I stood up in haste and was going to walk to the door when God interrupted me. “But I must warn you; you are automatically walking to your doom.”

“I know, but since I don’t really live I don’t really die either, do I?” I said, with a grin, and walked through the door.

“Smart kid” mumbled God “I wonder how long it will take him this time to figure out that he is my son.”

He had never truly created before. He'd done lots of making, lots of sorting, lots of piling. But never before had he created something from thin air. So he sat and began to try and do the impossible.


It took lots of concentration, something he had always lacked. He had always found that ideas seemed to assault with much greater force then they seemed to other people. Every sound, word, movement, color and character were threads forming a tapestry that covered him, changed him and the world around him was filtered through those threads. Each story that became part of his tapestry changed him a little more. Words that were not his filled his mind and sometimes escaping his mouth. 


The tapestry of stories that he carried with him seemed to be always growing. Others seemed to also carry their own tapestry, each beautiful in it's own way. But he always knew that his was the most beautiful. 


He worked constantly- refining his tapestry into a coat that would protect him and keep him warm. Instead of letting the words of the world come to him, he began to seek them out. Stealing the silks of stories anywhere he could find them and slowly working them into a form that better suited him and his needs.


He added to his coat of stories until had become long and heavy. He was quite proud of it and would use any opportunity he had to show it off (sometimes to the annoyance of others). But as proud as he was of his coat he began to find that it wasn't enough to just collect the pictures, words, and characters surrounding him. He wanted to make them. He wanted not to steal the silk that stories were made of but to create them like others did- out of thin air.


He had always been fascinated by these magicians, the ones who could create these stories out of this air. The tapestries their silk made seemed to help the world turn. They were the strings that could connect strangers, they were a recipe for both a smile and a tear. A truly great magician could, with a few of their blessed threads bring damnation or salvation.


He wanted to be one of those magicians. He wanted to be adored for the threads he pulled from the air. He wanted to be blessed. But he was afraid. Ever so afraid. Because just as someone could bring damnation to others, they could just as easily bring damnation and scorn to themselves.  For the magical threads were not truly pulled from the air. They were pulled from deep within the magicians. Tapestries were made of pictures, words, and stories but these threads were made from the memories, secrets and lives of magicians. To hold the thread of a magician was to hold something that was precious to that magician. 


And above all else he feared judgment.


He feared that after all these years of hiding within the words, pictures and stories of others that he would be empty inside. That if he reached to deep within himself he would find nothing but the air. So he would take pieces of the coat that he had made from the silk of other magicians and try to pass them off as his own. He received praise for the stories he had been collecting for so long. ""What stories you tell!"" they would claim. ""Truly you have a gift!"" He would nod and smile, thanking them for their praise. But he never truly felt pride for these second hand stories he passed about. He grew more and more depressed as he began to fear the emptiness that might exist within him. 


Then one day, hidden far from others he decided he couldn't take it anymore. He needed to know what was inside of him. 
He removed his coat and standing naked he reached within the deepest depths of his soul to see what lie there.
So deep did he reach that he forgot where he was, or even who he was. He reached until he saw it. A thread stretched before him shining bright. And he grabbed that thread and held onto it with everything he was. For the first time he felt the something that was truly his.


He awoke from his trance with this story in his hand. A story that seemed to have come from thin air. Filled with pride, he began to inspect his thread. Truly it was his, but...something about it seemed familiar. He grabbed the coat that he had constructed from the threads of other magicians. His thread looked like only a newer, shoddier version of the threads that made up his coat! He was filled with misery. So this was all he was capable of? After passing off the threads of his coat as his own he was now only capable producing terrible duplicates of the threads that he had loved and cherished. 


Horrified, he cast his thread that he had once held tightly in his hand aside and hugged his coat- the last comfort he had. For a long time he sat there, counting the threads he had collected over the years. Then he noticed something. The newer threads he had collected bared a strong similarity to the older threads of his coat. Why? He looked more closely and realized that the threads of the new magicians all seemed to resemble the older magicians that came before them. But why? Had these magicians done the same as he had? Were they all just as incapable as he was? He thought on this for some time and had a brilliant realization. 


What if, long ago, there was only one story? A cherished thread that was recreated over and over again, passed along and used for generations. Until one day someone created an imperfect version of that thread. It wasn't necessarily better- but it was capable of different magic that the first thread wasn't. Then what if someone duplicated that second thread, one that also imperfect? Then someone could have created a fourth thread by combining that second and third thread. What if this happened for millions of years? How many threads could there be? All of them coming from the same original idea but all of them still so very different. All of them making up the coat that covered him inside and out. 


Upon realizing this he reached within once more to pull out another thread. Sure enough, another imperfect thread was pulled from the air. Birthed from all the threads that had come before it, yet somehow different. He then realized that this was an experience all magicians had gone through. And with one imperfect, ugly thread in hand and on the ground next to him he realized that he was now a magician. 


He left his first thread where it lie, and hid the second. He was still to ashamed to call either thread his own. But he continued creating threads after that. Slowly and painfully at first, but then with time he began to create more and more. The more he created the easier it became. He eventually began to enjoying his threads. He knew that even with all their imperfection they were his. And in studying his threads he learned more and more about who he was. He dreamed of one day showing this threads to others, but the thought still terrified him. 


He stilled feared judgment above all else. 


He may have been a magician now, but that in no way guaranteed that the threads he created would be accepted. Showing off his coat to others was one thing- he knew that the threads that made up his coat were treasured and sought after. But the threads he himself made? His eyes were the only to have ever seen these. And he feared how others would treat them. If his threads were to be rejected he feared that he would no longer have the courage to create another. Considering this he ceased creating his threads. He tricked himself into thinking that the less threads he created the greater of quality they would be. But deep down he knew this to be a lie. He was constantly aware of his deep cowardice.




Then one day he could stand it no longer. He reached deep down a pulled a thread out of thin air. This thread held everything that was precious to him, and before a crowd of many people he exposed it. He did not know how they would react nor did he care. They could love the thread, they could laugh at it, they could hate it- they might even ignore it. But it didn't matter. Because he had decided that a magician who only creates magic for themselves serves no purpose but their own. And even the worse writer has more worth than one that hides their story away. 


Above all else he feared judgment. 

All else except never being heard at all.

It was also the very first time I was about to see GWAR on VHS. Danny Eggers explained, “It is cool to watch when you are high, but they made this specifically to give you a bad trip. You should never watch it on mushrooms or acid or anything like that.”

GWAR planned on giving me a bad trip? What a crazy thought. They did pop up, occasionally, throughout the years. Justin Walsh would later acquire one of their videos, as well. He and Danny Eggers got in a fight, years later, over some weed, after school. I wonder if they knew they shared the common thread that was GWAR. The snuck in, once, while I was watching ""Empire Records."" Once, in a room full of people doing cocaine, they managed to make an appearance. Everyone seemed to know that GWAR + psychedelics = bad idea.

Many years later, it's after midnight. I pull the mushrooms from the tupperware in the refrigerator and examine them. They were well tended, in life. Amazonian Psilocybes, if I'm not mistaken. Bluish purple veins throughout the stems and taller caps than I am used to seeing. Zero vermiculite. We got the best of the batch, I suspect.

Maria is recovering from the revelation that her boyfriend was, if not cheating, at least sleeping with their mutual friend. She is ready to do something crazy. Lash out. She was thinking sex. I was thinking something entirely different.

I estimate a half-eighth for each of us. Intentionally carrying out a bad idea, I take a deep breath to mentally prepare for what is about to happen.

Maria insists on ordering a pizza. I try to veto the idea, but it is too late. By the time we start tripping, we are guaranteed to have a visitor. I know I don’t have much time, so I make a call, try to wrap up my online conversation on George’s phone and start searching for a playlist. Something I haven’t heard in a while. We sync my Youtube channel with the Xbox and it begins. It starts with melancholic melodies and sounds that drive us to introspection.

The last message we receive from the outside world…
“Turn off this phone.”

I keep texting. Katherine fills my thoughts. The screen begins to dance. It has only been fifteen minutes. I know these mushrooms are strong. Very strong.

I lay down in the bedroom for a minute and tell George and Maria that I’ll be out when the pizza guy gets there.

There is only one person I want to be with and the feeling builds. Laying in a dark bedroom, I try to maintain control. I finally let go. The mushrooms are good. I embrace the trip and I fall into shaman mode. This is when I realize I have left George and Maria all alone on mushrooms. I know this is a bad idea.

Kishi Bashi is playing on the Xbox. Manchester. Buzzsessions. A beautiful piece. George repeats the song over and over. Reverses to parts he likes over and over. I come out of the bedroom.

Maria is under the covers on the couch. Hiding, but calm. George assumes she is asleep, but I know better.

George looks up and smiles. ""I am writing the most amazing poetry."" His phone is in his hand, his face aglow from the light of the screen. I laugh.

“George. You are on mushrooms. The outside world will never understand what you have to say, right now. I recommend you delete whatever you have done. But do it upstairs. I do not want to be in the same room as your phone.”

“Oh no.”

“What did you do?”

“I was writing on Carter’s wall.”

I can’t help but laugh. Kishi Bashi’s love song playing over and over again, and George wants to write poetry on Carter’s wall. She was off limits, according to Ian.

“Dude. Bad move. Take care of that right now, then ditch the phone.”

He goes upstairs.

Maria speaks undiscernibly. I ask her how she is feeling and tell her when she is ready to stop hiding, I will be here. I sit on the floor, with my head against the couch under Maria. Objects are moving. Bending. Swirling. The patterns come on strong. George returns with the phone and a computer.

“George. Get rid of that stuff. Go get some pillows and blankets and sit on the floor. Put it away.”

He goes upstairs, again. He comes downstairs in tears. I don't ask. When he finally settles in, he sees the colors, and starts to embrace the experience.

We smoke, we have little sips of bourbon and we commune and discuss the questions George has. I lay my shamanic knowledge upon him. The music begins to shift towards darker; heavier.
The pizza guy shows up. He had been calling. Finally had to climb the fence to get to us. He complains at George. All George can do is smile and says, “Yeah, sorry about that. Have a good night.”

No tip. Oops.

The pizza guy huffs off. I ignore it, because, now, Maria is no longer hiding. She has been listening.

Of course, nobody wants pizza. The peak is here and it is stretched out. The mushrooms are good.

Giggling. Indecipherable language. Everyone’s consciousness is in three places, at once. The remotes disappear in the dark.
This is when, after 20 years, GWAR finally makes their move. The end of the playlist had run out, but ended on Amon Amarth’s “Twilight of the Thunder God.” Xbox decided to follow in the same vein and “Let Us Slay” begins.

Their plan worked flawlessly. Maria starts to freak out. Crying hysterically. Too much noise for the middle of the night. George reacts to her anxiety. He is anything but calm. I give George things to do to distract him. I try different strategies on Maria. Different culture, weird brain. Can’t get inside, very well. She switches to hysterical laughter.

Better, but still loud.

George freaks out about the noise. I tell him to retrieve the Xanax. Maria enters back into a crying fit. Mumbling about how sad she is and she can’t understand why her ex left her. Hysterical again.

At one point, she freaks out over her contacts and has to take them out. She is, for all intents and purposes, it turns out, blind without her contacts or her glasses. Now she sees patterns and colors like she has never seen. She is into it, but the introspection kicks in and she begins crying hysterically, again. She switches back and forth between hysterical laughter and hysterical crying like no one I have ever seen. It is practiced. This is how she gets her way. Occasionally, when George is distracted she gets calm and asks, “Who are you?”

All I can say is, “I am what I am.”

She gets too comfortable, starts to open up about her ex boyfriend again. Freaks out again. Can’t see. Have to pass her water. Have to find her blanket. Like taking care of a little kid. Exhausting.

I switch to doctor mode.

“Maria. Listen to me. In my hand is a pill. It is called Xanax, and it is for anxiety. It is going to keep you calm and help you sleep very deeply. It is a strong dose. The largest they sell. Do you understand what I am telling you?”

“Yes.”

“Good. I would very much like for you to take this pill. More than that, I want you to recognize that your behavior is off the charts and want to take the pill yourself. Do you want to take the Xanax, Maria?”

“Yes.”

I hand her the pill. She spills water all over the place trying to drink, and then I explain to everyone to only take sips of water and why.

I also have to explain that water is “quiet water” and that you have to be quiet when you drink it, as laughing will cause it to spill all over yourself.

Maria starts freaking out, again. George is having a hard time handling.

“Don’t worry, she will be laughing again, soon, then she will get quiet and then she will start over with the crying. The loop will repeat and diminish every time as the Xanax starts to kick in.”
George is fascinated when my predictions come true.

At one point, her hysterics begin to include not being able to see.

She goes into spoiled brat mode on mushrooms. It is grating when we were sober, but now, it is intolerable. I produce the second Xanax and the battle of wills begins.

""No more, Dan. No more drugs.""

""Maria. One of us is going to take this pill. It will help you sleep.""

""No more drugs.""

She is fighting the first Xanax hard. I eat the second one.

Finally, I venture outside in the dark morning to retrieve her bags from my car so she can find her glasses. Once she has them, she false fast asleep to the playlist titled “Piano for Katherine.”

George is finally able to enjoy his trip. We become water brothers. Take the opportunity to go outside and explore. Smoke cigarettes. George has many important epiphanies about life. About his behavior. About the behavior of others. He marvels at how well I handle a hysterical Maria. Wonders why she had such a bad reaction to him all week long. When he is sitting on the couch, he finally asks.

“Danny, am I other people’s Maria Chan?”

“George, that is a very interesting and important question to ask yourself. Are you?”

We both know the answer. GWAR taught George all kinds of answers.

I was wondering as I was looking at the only other passenger sitting two rows down from me. He was sitting in one of those rows with a table between them, facing towards me. So I got a good look at him. His brown eyes were scanning the newspaper in his hands which was quivering with the vibrations of the train. He had a window cracked, and the breeze was blowing through his medium length gray hair. He was wearing an old fashioned suit, and with his mustache and spectacles, he was the spitting image of the kind of stereotype you might imagine when you hear 'elderly gentleman'. Was that a bowler hat on the seat next to him? Damn.

Although this guy did have that sort of friendly vibe going for him. Old people seem to swing to one of two extremes: those defeated by the struggles of their lives, viewing everything as nothing more than another obstacle to overcome; and those that have transcended the concerns and burdens that life brings with it, radiating an indefatigable happiness. Something told me this guy belonged to the latter group. Maybe it was the kindly wrinkles around his eyes, or the slight curving of his mouth and dimples that hinted at a face that liked to smile.

Suddenly he put the paper down. He cocked his head slightly as he met my gaze. Then he winked, and smiled. I could feel the color shoot to my face. Oh man, that was embarrassing! “I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to stare”, I stuttered.

It was fairly loud in the train, but I was sure I could hear a soft chuckling waft towards me. I spent the next few minutes pointedly looking anywhere but in his direction, and was pretty grateful when we hit a tunnel. At least now he couldn't see my face, which, I was sure, was still beet red. Thankfully the lights inside the train were not lit, either. Truthfully, there wasn't much point anyway. The sun was just dancing through a cloudless sky – it was one of those perfect summer days you hear about, that, when it finally arrives, turns out to be way too hot. Was the tunnel already ending? Ugh, that was too short for my liking.

Alright, this time I definitely did hear something. It sounded like a heavy sigh. “Young lady, if yer gunnae act like that, yer making it very awkward fer the two of us. C'mere, have a sit down.” He was gesturing emphatically, smiling at me. I couldn't help but grin at his genuine manner. “Jes dinnae sit on ma hat.”

Well, what was I gonna do? Avoid looking at the guy for the rest of the ride? I shook my head to myself and got up to join him. He rose slightly out of his seat and bowed to me as I sat down. “Now you needn't feel bad, fair few girls fall fer ma irresistible goo' looks.” He said this so earnestly that I couldn't help but grin at him again.

“I'm sorry about earlier, I didn't mean to stare.”

“Don' worry lass. Like I said, I'm used to the admirin' stares. Tell me, what brings you into this drab train on such a beau'iful dey?”

I smiled at him. “What brings anyone into a Train? I'm going to visit some relatives that I haven't seen in a while. They insisted that I come by.”

His bushy eyebrows drew down in mock sorrow. “Och, lass, the dey is much too nice to go spendin' it with relatives” I laughed, but he continued, pointing out the window. “Look, look! Nary a cloud in sigh'.”

“Well then, what about you?” I asked, “Where are you going?”

“See, I'm doin' it righ'. I outlived most o' ma relatives. And now,” he leaned forward conspiratorially, “now, I go where I please.”

“Well, that does sound exciting. I'm Lisa, by the way.” and I offered my hand. Instead of shaking it, he stood  up, awkwardly wedged between the table and the seat. Bending down, he slowly planted a kiss on my hand. A sudden lurch of the train caused him to lose his balance and sit back down with a grunt.

“Och, they don' make trains like they used ta...” he mumbled to himself. But he quickly recovered, and gestured grandly, continuing as if nothing happened. “It's a pleasure to make yer acquaintance. I am Earl Buchanan.”

There was something in the way he inflected “Earl”. I cocked my head and looked at him questioningly. “So... you're royalty?”

He returned my gaze very seriously. The reflection on his spectacles mirrored the trees that were passing by outside. Not even the breeze dared ruffle his hair. He frowned slightly, his bushy eyebrows drawing down, giving him a very stern look. He looked down over his spectacles at me and, in an anticlimactic baritone, said “No.”

I was somewhat taken aback, thinking I might have offended him. But, he immediately smiled at me once more, and I concluded that it must simply be his strange sense of humor. “No, me name is Earl. I'm nae royalty but.. I can see how you would think that.”

At least, I thought to myself, this wouldn't be a boring ride. Earl spent the next few hours telling me about his life. He had some exciting stories to share.

He told about growing up in the Scottish Highlands, herding sheep with his dogs Ernest and Hemmingway. He told me of the Highland cows, that apparently looked like “someone gave an oversized mop two sets o' legs”. He spoke to me of his difficulties in school, and how he left his home in search of opportunities overseas with the economic upswing following the second World War.

“I missed me father terribly. Bu', I think I woulda missed the opportunity to take me life into me own hands even more,” he said, running two wrinkly fingers over his mustache. “And,” he continued with enthusiasm, “what tales would I have shared with you on this train then? Bovine ma'ing season?”

He spoke about finding employment in a small bakery in North Carolina, how his hard work and dedication earned him the trust of the owner. He told me how he declined taking over the bakery, instead electing to travel the country, taking jobs of opportunity while he traveled through the United States. “You see, I kinnae sit still. I was always lookin' fer somethin' that I gave up when I left home.”

He told me about making his way to Washington, where he witnessed the now famous speech my Martin Luther King. It gave him renewed strength to follow a dream of his own. He started a business, and I couldn't help but chuckle when I heard what it was: custom tailored suits and fashionable men's wear. He cocked his head at me and smiled when he heard my chuckle, saying “I take pride in me work. Jes don' ask me where I learned it.”

He spent the next few decades expanding his brand, dealing with apathetic partners, loan sharks and crooked con artists. I never realized the intricacies and pitfalls of self-employment. “But,” he said, “I am now a rich man. I've reached the goal I set fer meself all those years ago.”

“So, you asked me where I was goin'? I'm goin' home, lass. I've seen all I was meant to see, and the bones of me father are callin' to me.” His expression turned sombre, and for a moment I could feel a hint of the longing this man must experience. It tore at my heart. “And, you know,” he continued, his usual smiling self, “they dinnae understand me here enyway”.

“And you,” he said, suddenly, jabbing his finger in my direction, “You should consider spending yer summer at home. Summer is a long time to be away from yer fam'ly. And,” he leaned forward, “take it from me... relatives are a poor excuse.”

He smiled at me once more. But this time there was an urgency in his eyes that hadn't been there before. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it... at that moment, we entered another tunnel, and everything went dark.


I opened my eyes. Or, I tried to. Only one seemed to respond. There was a dull throbbing that defied my attempts at identifying its origin or cause. My vision gradually found focus, and I was able to discern what I was looking at. It was a beautiful summer sky. Utterly cloudless and the most perfect shade of blue. I tried drawing a deep breath, but a sharp stabbing in my chest drew that short. A gasp of pain escaped by dry throat.

I tried sitting up, but my arms wouldn't respond. All I could do was feel the gravelly surface of the asphalt beneath my fingers. The same surface, I realized, that was painfully digging into the back of my head.

And then a shadow moved across my eyes. I flinched, but a gentle hand reached out and prevented me from moving. My head was killing me. I didn't have the energy to fight it. The shadow was hovering in front of me, its outline flickering and slowly solidifying. I could make out bushy eyebrows under a swath of gray hair that was slowly wafting in the breeze. Sweat was glistening on a wrinkly brow and kindly brown eyes were gazing into my own.

I remembered. A flashback, but it was real. I was there, again. I could feel the impact ripping the bike out from under me. I could feel my left leg bending, ligaments tearing, bone breaking. I heard the screeching of tires and the acidic scraping of metal. I could see the horizon shift, and I knew my head was approaching the windshield again... I was bracing for the impact that I knew was inevitable.

“Hoo there. Easy, lass.” A genuine smile flickered through a face well suited for it. “You gave me quite a scare. You'll be a'righ now. Easy.”

The room is sparsely furnished, without anything uunnecessary giving the room an empty feeling. On one side of the room there is a Queen sized bed, the sheets are made perfectly, with what could only be practiced methodicism. On the other side of the room there are some bay windows, the windows are closed and the light curtains are drawn letting in little light, outside it is twilight, giving the room a dark yellow tinge . In one corner there is a dresser, the dresser top has been organized in such a way to draw the observer's attention to one picture in specific. The majority of the light from the window hangs on the top of the dresser, which is filled with picture frames and pictures from what seems like another universe, next to the pictures are letters and medals for honor and bravery.

 Next to the dresser is a rocking chair with an old man sitting in it. His frame is well built, with broad shoulders and a thick neck. The Man's best years behind him, his skin now hangs off of him much like the drapes from the top of the bay window. The Man is slowly rocking back and forth muttering truths the world has long forgotten, but remain true to him. His face looks as though he just swallowed something very bitter, a grimace of sorts.
The door to the rest of the building slowly creaks open and The Lawyer walks in. The Lawyer is a skinny man, with pale, almost transparent skin. His suit is unimpressive, the most interesting accessory is his tortoise rimmed glasses, which frame his empty pale eyes. The Lawyer's face is devoid of any wrinkles, much like that of a baby, and if he wasn't fully grown it wouldn't surprise The Man if he started crying and asking for his mother's breast. When The Lawyer shuts the door quietly behind him the room takes on a cool eerie feeling, much as if it had transformed from a home to a cold, damp graveyard. The light from the window seems to bend towards The Lawyer, and the dresser top dims noticeably as The Lawyer takes a seat near the door.
There is a moment of silence before The Man begins, with a voice that needs convincing:

The Man: It's not so bad, you know.

The Lawyer says nothing, just giving the same unblinking stare as before.

The Man: At first I was worried, scared even. It isn't everyday that I have been so closely acquainted with my mortality. I can count the number of times on one hand, in fact... But this time I don't think they'll give me a metal hahaha!

The Lawyer remains motionless, simply watching the man. The Lawyer is so still to the audience it would seem he isn't even breathing. Clearly unsettled the man argumentatively continues:

The Man: Not much of a talker, are you? Well, that's alright. I don't feel like having a conversation anyway.

There is a silence for a while before The Man shifts uncomfortably in his seat. It is clear that The Man does want a conversation. The Man by turns takes glances at the dresser top and The Lawyer before continuing:

The Man: It really isn't so bad... It's Father's day, if you don't already know. I am a father myself. I have two boys, well, they were boys. It seems silly calling them that now, they could toss me over their shoulders if they chose to. (The Man laughs a little, not robustly like before, but knowingly. Confidently.) Yeah, they've grown up... I won't pretend I was the perfect father, in some ways I was the worst. I look at all these pictures and I noticed something, would you like to know what I noticed?

The Lawyer moves for the first time, slowly dropping his head into a nod. The Lawyer's hair doesn't move, his suit doesn't crinkle, almost as if he were a plastic replica of a real man.

The Man: Alright, I noticed that, in all these pictures everyone is always smiling.  No one ever takes pictures of the times when no one is smiling. But that isn't the truth, is it? (The Man clears his throat awkwardly it is clear that he isn't used to talking about something so personal)
No. No one takes pictures of the bad times, only the good times. Why should that be? It should be easy to remember the good... It seems to me, that the good always fades behind the bad, it's easier to remember the hard stuff. There's some irony in that. And now here I sit, close to the end, and all I feel is regret. All the bad sticks out in my mind and the voices of the mistakes I made call out to me across the years, but then, I look at these pictures, and I remember the good stuff. Like, like this one (The Man enthusiastically points to the picture in the middle of the dresser, the picture is faded, but four figures can be made out. Three men and a Woman)

That's my family, or, it was before my wife died. And then I just couldn't keep them together. I just had too many expectations. I wanted something else for my sons, and all they wanted was to be their own men. I regret that I hadn't let them live their own lives I thought I knew what they wanted, but my desire for them overrode what I should have been doing: let them grow on their own. That's what I am doing now though, right? (The Man's eyes haven't left the picture, a pause) I lived my dream. Now they live theirs. I'm passing the torch. When I realize that, I know the only truth: I lived the dream. It's time for them to do it on their own. I think that, and I can only be happy. This is one of those times that a picture should be taken. So people can remember the happy time.

The Man's face curls into a smile, a genuine smile. The Man kept rocking, but the rocking was less lively. Next to him the heart monitor goes dead. A monotone beep is heard throughout the room, and nurses rush in to see if they can save The Man. They pay no attention to The Lawyer, almost as if he isn't there, going around him like a large rock in a river. The Lawyer gets up and looks more closely at the picture on the dresser. The four people are smiling, everyone is happy, like the best kind dream you could have. The corner of The Lawyer's mouth curled up into a whimsical smirk before he left to a room just down the hall.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1gpp5o,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gpp5o/first_share_wanna_know_what_you_guys_think/,

She loved nights like these, where her grandmother would tell her stories. To her eight year old eyes, grandma was the wisest person in the whole city... no... the whole world. As her eyes scanned the room as her grandmother told her about how in her days they used to catch dragonflies and tie them on string, something glistened softly on the mantelpiece where the fireplace was. Upon closer inspection, she saw that it was a red stone set in what seemed to be a crude flower frame, no larger than her thumb. Curious about the object she turned and asked her grandmother, who had the answer to everything ""Gramma, what's that?"".

Anna was taken by surprise, because Suzy had been quiet all the while. She looked in the direction that her granddaughter was pointing, and saw the little brooch on the mantelpiece. ""Why Suzy, you mean the little flower brooch over there? The red one?"" said Anna. Suzy looked confused. ""Gramma... what's a broooch?"" she asked. Anna laughed and said as simply as she could ""Well, it's a shiny thing just like that one, which we sometimes use to pin to clothes"". ""ohh..."" said Suzy, and she got up to take a closer look. Her grandmother motioned to her to bring it closer, and Suzy sat in her lap once more, this time with brooch in hand.

""Where did you get it from gramma? Did grampa give it to you?"" asked Suzy. Anna laughed again, then with a slightly more solemn expression said ""No, not from grampa. It was a present from someone else, when I was very young. In fact, I think I was just about your age"". ""Wow... who was it?"" asked Suzy, filled with curiousity. Anna smiled gently at her granddaughter, and told her story just as she remembered it...

Anna was playing in the snow then, something she had always loved. Her father had been gone for 2 years at that point, and her mother was busy at work as usual. Her brother was in the house, studying furiously as he had been for some time, and he was never any fun. So she had gone to her secret spot in the hilltop where she could see the whole town and where the air was fresher. There she observed the hustle and bustle as the people went about their day in the city below, and she drew circles in the snow. Ah... bliss.

Not long after she had begun to build a tiny snowman army, she heard footsteps coming up the pathway. Turning around, she saw a man dressed in a winter coat walking up the path. When he caught sight of her, he smiled and winked at her. ""Ah, so my secret place isn't so secret after all, is it?"" he said. Anna frowned and said ""Nuh uh, this is my secret place! I came here first! It's mine, mister!"". ""Ah, you must be right! My mistake. Well, it's been a tough day, so would you mind sharing your special spot with me for awhile so I can catch my breath?"" said the man playfully. Anna inspected him from head to toe before finally saying ""Well... you look you're not a bad guy, so I guess I'll let you. But just this once!"". The man smiled, and thanked her graciously.

He sat there in the snow watching the city, while she continued building the snowman army. Once that was complete, she started work on the bad guys, big monstrous creatures. Of course, they would still be no match for her army, because the bad guys always lose in the end. All of the stories her mother told her ended that way.

After he had sat there for a long time, he came over to her to see what she had made. ""So... what do have here, little one?"" he asked again. ""These"" she said, pointing to the snowman army ""are the good guys and they will fight against"" then she pointed to the monsters she had made out of snow ""these baddies here. And they'll win of course!"". The man smiled, a little sadly. ""Do the good guys always win?"" he asked weakly. ""Yes! Of course they do!"" said Anna confidently. The man fell silent for a short while. Then he said ""I wish I had your conviction little one, but sometimes it feels as though no matter what I do, no matter how hard we fight, the bad guys won't give in"". ""Don't worry mister"" said Anna, ""as long as you're a good guy you have nothing to fear, right?"". He smiled, and then nodded.

""You're right, little one."" he said. ""It's hard sometimes. I'm sure even for a little one like you this war has been hard. So many of our people are suffering because of it. Yet it is a necessary suffering, because we have to win against the bad guys. We have to do what is right."" he said with a steely resolve in his voice. ""I promise you little one, when this war is over, things will be good again. We will have won against the bad guys, and things will be good"" he said. Anna jumped excitedly upon hearing this, and danced in the snow. ""You better win against the baddies mister!"" she said. the man simply nodded in response.

They heard footsteps walking up the hill, and a soldier dressed in full military regalia walked towards them. The man smiled and said ""looks like I have to go little one. You have been good company, and I feel refreshed. Thank you for sharing your spot with me"". He pulled out a brooch from his coat pocket, shaped like a flower and with a ruby in the middle and handed it to her. ""This I bought for someone else, but I think it is better left with you"". Anna stared at the shiny brooch, and beamed with excitement upon receiving something so beautiful. She hugged him in gratitude.

Then the soldier spoke ""Fuhrer, it is time for us to go"". The man smiled at Anna once more, and he left with the soldier.

 

That was the first and last time she ever saw the man in person.

""Why do you keep it gramma?"" asked Suzy. ""Well..."" said Anna, ""I used to believe, just like that man that evil and good were two easily distinguishable things. That there were the good guys and the bad guys, and the purpose of the good guys was to make sure the bad guys were defeated at all costs. People will tell you this Suzy, that this man is bad, or that man is good. In reality I think that it isn't anywhere near that simple."" She held her granddaughter close.

"" I guess the reason I keep it Suzy, is to remind myself to never lose sight of the humanity that is in us all"".",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1gkrct,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gkrct/red/,

The streets outside of the window groan with each passing car, but none make noise. They are all distant, many miles away. Inside, there is more silence.

There is no object that can penetrate the silence. There is no outside. There is only here, there is only now. 

And now is a time for sitting. For quietly taking in what's before her. A bed sheet, a blanket, two pillows, and her feet. I like this, she thinks, but the registration of her thought disturbs her silence, so she pushes them back down and merely looks. She looks upon them, on the hardwood floor of her studio, and silently expresses satisfaction for herself, for her will to push past where she'd been, and where she is at now. All quietly, all without a thought. Loneliness introduces itself with a whisper, but it knows its place and its place is far away. It merely notifies her of its presence and that is enough. She acknowledges it for that's all that it needs, and continues on with what's before her. Mine, she thinks. The thought is firm and it creates ripples across her studio. It is not a disturbance, but a natural part of the world. There has never been anything more natural than a thought that is secure and definite and at this moment. I made this. This is mine. 

And I like it. 

And, hearing the conviction in her thought, far and away, Doubt rose and looked her way. And doubt was far. Very far. But there is a certain quality of Doubt that allows it to travel with a speed not limited by distance or time. And Doubt is not an impatient thing, it is one that is content to wait, and linger, and haunt, like Lonliness. Together, they are powerful forces that do not need to be near to be known. So Doubt rose and looked out at her and she felt it. Even from that distance, and with all the conviction she had within her, she felt Doubt. 

It was not a good feeling, but she didn't have time to worry about Doubt now. The silent world was starting to murmur and she would not have it. Not tonight. Not while she had created her retreat in the middle of her living room. Not tonight. Not ever. So she stayed where she was and looked at her pillows, and blankets, and bed sheets and felt satisfied. But there was more to do. She needed string to suspend the sheets. She needed to get up to tie the string to her window blinds and across the room to her kitchen cabinet doors. She needed to make those secure so that her bed sheets would be able to hang from them and create the tent that she had in her mind. And then she needed to light it. She needed to create the atmosphere that would make her tent living room perfect. She needed her retreat and she needed it to be perfect. 
And so, that's what she did. 

She laid down her blankets, creating a soft bedding in the middle of her open living room. Above it, she suspended string reaching across the entirety of her studio, from the window blinds to the open kitchen cabinets, securing them tightly at each end, making them perfect for the exact tent shape that she wanted. A small pride grew within her as she started to see her creation take shape. She viewed it as herself and as an observer watching herself create and then be within the space she saw she was creating, and a small seed of accomplishment sprouted within her alongside her pride. All it needed now were some books to hold the sides of the suspended sheets down to create the proper shape of a tent and then some lights to - 

and Lonliness comes again. A quick step closer than where it was before. It is pushed back by her will, but its step into her territory was a message: I am always here. I am always close. She stands at this and closes her eyes. There are no sights, there are no sounds, there is only me. There is only my wants and my desires and that is all. There is nothing else. There is only what I want. Lights. I want light. 

And the lights she has in mind are perfect. Small electric diodes taped to the inner lids of mason jars. Simply made and, when their wires are touched to a battery, emitting a warm light, they look to be the glow of small fireflies. Magic in a jar. Magic in a living room. It's beautifully cinematic and it's perfect.

You know those nights you're deep asleep then suddenly you're not. There's no loud noise or anything, your just wide awake. Something isn't right, you can always tell. Your eyes, wide open, straining in the darkness to see something in the dim light oozing round the edge of the curtains from the street. You're being perfectly still, if someone or something is there you don't want them to know you're awake just yet. 
Then you see it, an outline in the darkness, black on black but definitely there. Your heart stops as you freeze. 
Don't look away. 
It hasn't seen you're awake yet. Just get ready to move, go for the bedside lamp and your swiss army knife on the table. 
Don't look away. 
You make your move, swinging up and out of bed in one motion, the light is on and you can see, it's just a jacket on the back of the door. 

Monsters aren't real. 

We've all had those nights. Nights where dream and reality blurs together just enough to scare the shit out of you as your imagination, unbound by the normal constraints of waking life, is allowed to run free. It can take even a few minutes for reality to assert itself and logic to prevail, after all, why would someone be staring in your bedroom window at night? 

When I have these nights I try to remind myself that it's my mind playing tricks on me and that there's nothing in the room with me. I roll over, making noises like I'm asleep just in case, but I can't forget it. I need to check. Despite thinking things over it's hard to apply logic to something from an illogical realm of existence. Sure enough, it's a shadow or something making me scared over nothing once more. 

Monsters aren't real. 

I don't know what causes this in me but it happens once every month or so, it's not a schedule or anything, it just seems to happen from time to time. Most of the time I can't even remember my dreams. I sleep soundly from when I nod off to when I wake. 

Tonight, I'm exhausted, it was a long day at work. I was tired from the moment I came home but I'm not great at napping so I don't bother. I either sleep for too long and can't sleep at night or just can't sleep because I'm tired but not sleepy. 

I must have drifted off about 1am. It's definitely later now and I'm suddenly awake once again. I can feel my heart racing in my chest and the hair on the back of my neck is on edge. Something isn't right. I'm facing the wall. I can't let whatever it is know I'm awake. I grunt a bit as I roll over, it's dark. I can see the sliver of light from the top of the curtains and I can make out some shapes in blackness of the room. My desk, my wardrobe. There's an outline. Something is definitely there. 
Don't look away. 
Remember to breath, sleeping people breath. Get ready to go for the light and your knife, it's on the desk. 
Don't look away. 
I make my move, eyes locked on the shape as I flick the light and grab my knife, the light is on and I can see.

Living is hard. It requires actions and plans, a degree of ambition that you do not have and other things that you are too lazy to work upon. You would rather think of possibilities and live within their fantastical confines. It's easier that way. It's more comfortable. And plus, you are good with excuses and excuses are much easier than the alternative. Excuses only require words and thinking. Not even great thinking, only lazy half-assed thoughts are allowance enough to keep you from doing anything that you should be doing. And, really, fuck, ""should."" What is ""should?"" It's nothing. You *shouldn't* have to be doing anything that you don't want to and, dammit it all, there's nothing that you really ""should"" be doing anyway. It's not a ""have to,"" it's not a ""must."" And even if it were a ""must,"" it wouldn't really be a ""must."" There are very few ""musts"" in life and all the ""musts"" that you must do, you've already done, so there's nothing really to worry about. 

So just sit there. Just sit there and read and write and do nothing. Live in your mind, where all the potential for your greatness is already realized and your fidelity to perfection is never sacrificed. Nobody knows how great you really are. They will never know and it's their loss, really. If someone was able to read your mind and your thoughts, know your emotions, know your opinion on certain matters and everything else you know in your mind, they would see how truly wonderful you really are. Because you really are. If only they could know how wonderful your dreams are. Because that is where you live. Inside your dreams where the world really does revolve around you. Where nothing else matters except you. There really is nothing more important than you. Everyone else just doesn't know it yet. So sit there, continue dreaming. Continue in your fantasy.

  Against  the  blood  red  sky, a lone helicopter
  hovers around the city looking for any trace of   survivors that might  be below. Down on what used   to be the peaceful city, (now referred to as ground   zero) the horrific cries of death and fear bellow   throughout the city. Never stopping.. Like a record     stuck in a loop. The dead have poured out from the   deepest depths of hell and returned to the living.     Devouring every living soul that they come across.     The city is in ruins. Overturned and abandoned cars     littler the street, buildings turned to ash from the     riots and looting, death and gore fill the streets   turning the once pure black asphalt now to a deep   murky red. Over the pain filled screams of the living   and the mindless groans of the undead, Kenton and   Elizabeth hear a desperate shriek
 from the   helicopter, “Any survivors that can hear me, get to  the roof tops NOW!!” Elizabeth’s  
eyes and face light up with a hopeful glee. “We can   get out!” she exclaimed. “They’re here to save us.”  
 Kenton’s face however, had that horrified look that   had been there since the infection ravished the city.   “Yeah, if we can even make it that far” he silently said to himself.   
        

      
     
Kenton gazed around the corner of the hunting 
supplies shop they had been trying to gain access 
to. “There is an old grocery store about a block from 
here that they should be able to see us from.” 
Kenton said. “I don’t care what it is, as long as we 
get the hell out of here.” Elizabeth murmured. “We’re 
going to need guns if we are even going to stand a 
chance at getting over there.” Kenton exclaimed. So, 
Kenton pulled the last bobby pin out of his pocket 
and slowly slipped it into the lock on the door that 
opened the gun store they’d been hiding behind 
silently. Saying a prayer under his breath he ever so 
carefully and slowly maneuvered it until he heard 
the slight clicking sound. “Thank you” he whispered. 
He placed his sweaty palm around the knob and 
slowly turned it being careful not to make a sound. 
With it opened, he and Elizabeth let out a sigh of 
relief as there was no one in the store. Luckily this 
one hadn’t been looted in the chaos in the 
beginning.  
        

      
        
They slowly moved in, Elizabeth so close behind 
Kenton, he could feel the warmth of her moist 
breath. They found where the weapons had been 
displayed. Kenton picked off a twelve gauge from the wall along with four boxes of shells, from the 
display case he picked a .454 magnum up surprised 
by the weight and the how the cool steel and 
plywood felt in his grip than walked behind the 
counter, and picked up three boxes of ammunition. 
When he noticed the M-16 automatic rifle propped 
up against the back of the counter. The owner of the 
store was obviously planning to use but never got 
the opportunity to. “Good, better for us.” He thought. 
When he did he hated himself a little for being so 
heartless. But quickly dismissed the feeling and 
found where the ammunition had been stored and 
picked it up along with the sling that had been 
placed next to it and attached the sling and placed it 
around his back. After loading the weapons and 
putting the rest in a place where he could easily 
access, he put the .454 in the gun holster he had 
looted off a corpse that had been thoroughly 
executed with a bullet to the back of the head. 
Kenton could still vividly see the pool of blood and 
skull fragments that had quietly settled around the 
poor man in the back of his subconscious. He 
snapped out of the gruesome thought and placed 
the excess ammunition in his bag and decided there 
wasn’t anywhere else to hold another gun and 
began to gather up his newly stocked bag. 
 


          
As he and Elizabeth were exiting the shop, he 
noticed a door that he somehow missed upon first 
arrival. On the other side of the door, he heard a wet 
slurping noise that almost sounded like a dehydrated dog attempting to drink from its bowl. He didn’t know why, but he had to know what was on the other side of that door… He felt the cool metal against his sweaty anxious palm. He slowly turned the knob and the door opened. He immediately regretted the decision. What he seen would forever burned into his memory. In the dark crowded room, a man with a noose around his thick neck hung a foot off the ground. And around the poor souls feet was a thick pool of blood with bits and pieces of torn flesh and a… a half-eaten hand with three missing fingers… It was then that Kenton noticed one of the undead on the man. Its hands digging into the stomach of the man ripping it open with ease. Kenton stared in shock as the man’s small intestine slowly slip out and dangled inches off the ground slowly swaying back and forth and the undead man took giant bites into the poor man’s flesh. And in a hypnotic gaze Kenton watched as the blood poured out of the man like a waterfall hitting the ground making the pool bigger. He had failed to notice Elizabeth screaming at him and the undead man now absent from the scene and who was now shambling towards him. And when he did, it was too late. The undead man fell onto Kenton with his full weight, taking all the breath out of him. In a panicked set of motions he desperately reached for the .454 that was in its holster. But as he did, time seemed to freeze. He stared into its lifeless eyes that were now pure glossy white, no pupil or lens left, which terrified Kenton. But when he looked upon the mouth of the creature he felt a fear that he had never experienced before, a mind numbing fear that sent a cold shiver to his very core. The undead man was grinning at him. An evil, soulless, demonic grin that took the color out of his face… He then seemed to float out of his body and watch the events unfold. Like a dream. He watched as he pulled out the .454, centered the gun against its temple, cocked the hammer back, and pulled the trigger spraying the opposing wall with thick murky blood, brain matter, and bits of skull fragment. 



         
He snapped back into reality. He quickly jumped to his feet knowing the gunshot that still buzzed in his almost deafened ears would certainly alert more to their presence. He quickly grabbed Elizabeth and turned to run out the door. It was then he noticed the man who hung himself had reanimated, and was desperately trying to break free of the noose but to no success. He felt pity on the man. He pointed his magnum at his head and shot. There was now a gaping hole where the man’s left eyes once was. With that, they quickly evacuated the shop and made a desperate run towards the old grocery store. By the time Kenton and Elizabeth got halfway to the store dozens of the undead were running after them. “FASTER!” Kenton shouted as he was firing rounds off into the crowd. They reached the store, and put a little distance between themselves and the horde.

   
 
     
 But once they stepped inside they looked upon the store with horror. The undead were here. Hordes of them. They looked up from the piles of dead they were feasting on eyes fixed upon Kenton and Elizabeth. “Run!” screamed Kenton. They broke into a sprint with the undead not far behind running after them. Kenton managed to blow the heads off a couple with the .454 while firing into the horde behind them. They had finally reached the stairs and only one appeared on them. Kenton ran up next to it, took the 12 gauge that Elizabeth had been holding and shoved the barrel into its mouth as it let out a high pitched moan and fired. Completely blowing of the lower portion of the undead’s head sending it spiraling over the railing doing acrobatics as it flew down. They ran up the emergency stair well all the way to the roof and quickly slammed the door shut. Kenton took the opportunity to reload his various weapons. The nearby hovering chopper saw them and quickly flew over to the roof the couple was on. It flew close enough for the couple to get on board. Kenton picked up Elizabeth’s small figure with ease and quickly handed her to the soldier who was completely decked out in full protective body gear and a gas mask making him appear bulky and overweight. As she safely got aboard, Kenton slowly stepped back and gazed at her. She looked at him with confused gaze. “Kenton what in the hell are you doing?! Get up here NOW!!” She screamed almost crying now. He didn’t say anything. He just stood and looked at her perfect features. Her soft red hair flowing in the wind, her flawless complexion, her gorgeous face… Everything about her perfection he took in one last time. “I’m sorry my love I can’t go…” He said with tears rolling down his cheeks. Elizabeth only than noticed the deep bite mark that protruded his neck already making the skin around the wound decay. “NO!!!!” She screamed at the top of her lungs she was now bawling. She attempted to jump out to hug him but was stopped by the solider. “Please don’t cry my love. You are safe, that’s all that matters… I promised I’d keep you safe and I did. Be happy my love. I love you so much and I always will Elizabeth.” He took the wedding ring off his finger, and placed it in the palm of her hands and kissed her goodbye. 


         
 That’s when the door broke down and dozens of the undead poured out. “I love you” he cried as the helicopter lifted into the air and took off. He then turned and faced the now approaching undead horde. The 12 gauge in his hands and the M-16 dangling carelessly around his back. He opened fire into the horde blowing off limbs and sending groups of them spiraling backwards. Through the thick red mist created by their blood, he could see that demonic grin they all seemed to have. “Damn out of ammo he said.” He then dropped the weapon to his feet and pulled the M-16 from around his back and opened fire into the oncoming horde. He was unsure of how many he had actually killed. The blood spurting out of the undead bodies like water erupting from a geyser.  Spraying bullet after bullet into the undead mass that was now sprinting towards him, Kenton heard the distinct ping sound indicating that the gun was now out of ammo. Not wasting any time Kenton dropped the M-16 and pulled his .454 magnum out. Glancing down upon it the looking at the undead horde sprinting at him, he slowly lifted the gun to his temple, cocked the hammer back, whispered the words “I love you Elizabeth” one last time and gently pulled the trigger. The last thing that Elizabeth saw as the helicopter escaped the building that’s rooftop was now painted red was the faint red mist coming from Kenton’s skull and his body slowly falling into oblivion, than hitting the ground with a horrid thumping noise that would haunt her forever     ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1370748690.0,,,True,t3_1fxxvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fxxvw/against_the_blood_red_sky/,

While I was sitting outside the coffee shop across from the theater, I overheard a woman’s conversation with what appeared to be her boyfriend. I was waiting for my ride home, so I decided to people watch to pass the time. This woman’s conversation kept catching my ear, however, and I decided to listen for a bit. 

The woman spoke to her boyfriend about her children, telling him how one of them is just so funny when you get him talking about something he’s interested in, and how smart her daughter is. She told him about how her children were doing in school, how she loved them so much, and how they were growing up so fast. The man laughed along and nodded in all the right places, and they seemed to be having a nice time together. 

Having heard enough of their conversation to satisfy my curiosity, I looked over at the theater. I admired all the arches and pillars and lights that made up the face of the building, and warmly remembered the theater’s opening week. People crowded the stairs, cars filled the parking lot and the outer walls were immaculate white, red letters shining from above the crystal clear glass of the windows that lined the massive, shining glass doors. Now, looking at the theater, I notices streaks of gray stained down the tops of the walls and dull spots on the windows, dimmed lights where the theater’s name used to shine so brightly. 

Although it was a warm June day, the sky was filled with clouds and there was a strong wind. Gulls stood on the light fixtures above the flapping movie banners that hung on the theater’s wall, watching the occasional car meander through the parking lot. Other birds flew through the sky, catching the wind when they could and diving down to the ground before rising back into the sky. I watched them flying and felt happy that birds could be so happily excited by something that they were given by nature. In our own way, humans aren’t so different from the birds. Birds were naturally given flight, and humans were naturally given the tools to create. 

I saw a group of children playing on a horizontal column of basalt, playing chicken and pretending the ground was lava. They laughed and smiled, having fun in the warm wind as I observed from a distance. The children were supervised by one of their fathers, and although there was so much fun being had around him, he looked bored as he sat watching on the bench carved from basalt across from them. 

I looked back at the chatting couple sitting near me and found them kissing. In the moment before I shifted my gaze back to the theater, I caught a flash of gold from the woman’s hand. The ring on her hand had no gem, and was dulled with age. Despite the fact that I didn’t have all of the background on their story, my heart sank at this small detail. I had felt joy at watching a woman who was, to the extent of my knowledge, having an affair with this man. 

I glanced back to the theater, gloomily looking at the grayed stairs, disenchanted from the realization that the happy couple was really just a display of infidelity. I saw that the escalators I had once ridden to the gleaming glass doors of the theater were now blocked by yellow tape and perfectly still. The glass roof over the escalators was dulled by rain and sun over the years, making its slow journey to opaqueness. The walls were spotted with brightness in places that were once covered by light fixtures that had long fallen off of it. My eyes slowly rose to the top of the building, where two metal spires reached into the sky, holding in place a great metal circle through which the spot of sun in the clouds shone. 

I realized at that moment that I was seeing the building exactly how its imaginer had intended it to be seen, with the sun shining through the centerpiece of his wall. I widened my view to see the whole face of the building as one, rather than as individual, flawed pieces. I was amazed to see how beautiful the building I had been looking at was, and how all of the flaws disappeared when you looked at it all together. 

Momentarily in awe, I looked around at all of the people around me.
I caught a glimpse of the couple holding hands, and noticed that the man had a ring to match the woman’s. Along with that, I heard the woman say with a shaky voice how sad she would be when he had to return to serve in the military. 

When I looked over to the group of children, I saw the man supervising them smiling and laughing with the children while rounding them up and taking them to his vehicle. I saw the van pull away, carrying the group of children to their little league game. 

Then, I heard a tapping sound to my right and saw that a gull had landed on the table next to mine. He pecked up the crumbs left over from the coffee shop’s earlier customers, and flew off again, dipping and rising in the wind. 

My ride pulled up in front of the theater and I began walking toward it. I then caught another glimpse of the theater, and was happy to see that it was still as beautiful as it had been during its opening week. My eyes drifted higher and I saw that the sun had slipped from its socket atop the theater, and I smiled, feeling like I had shared a secret with the person who had envisioned the theater.

Although I only rarely see the theater now, I always remember how I felt when I stepped back and saw it for what it really was. I now realize that everything is worth looking at more than once, and that the way you first see things isn’t always how they truly are.

She lived inside the fever dream that played in Kurt’s mind when he zoned out in the backseat of his mom’s SUV on rides across town. His eyes would always fix solely on the streets that scrolled past, but to him there were no street names; they were just the blurs between places. He couldn’t tell a visitor directions to the Wal-Mart in the town where he had lived all of his 14 years. It was nearing the end of the first post-middle school summer, and it stretched outwards like a single, repetitive day. He lived in a run-on sentence, punctuated only by the commas of sleep, and the uneasy anticipation for a period provided an anxiety that incubated in Kurt’s gut.

Any time that summer when Kurt sat down with nothing to occupy him she would materialize, first as a repeating snippet of film; she smiled and tussled Kurt’s hair like she had done once in George’s kid sister’s treehouse, and she and the backdrop that stemmed off of her were foggy and soft and bright. He made it through a week on that image alone, until he craved more. He rebuilt her inflections, her pitch, lower and gruffer than the carbon copy schoolgirls, lacking the exaggerated Arkansan drawl that his classmates often hid behind. He conjured a story of both them in their 20s, until they were all tattoos and piercings. They smoked cigarettes next to a graffitied underpass by a faraway 7/11. They laughed about those suckers who shopped at supermarkets for family supper. She kissed him on a stained couch on the corner of some grimy Northern street, and because he didn’t know what a kiss felt like he imagined it, cushiony and moist and sweet-smelling. 

The SUV pulled up to his friend Zack’s house. Kurt got out and rang the doorbell. His mom waited outside until Zack opened the door. She yelled “Make good decisions!” to them and waved before driving away.

“Fucking bitch,” Zack said. “She’s still doing that?”

“Apparently she thinks everyone she doesn’t know is a rapist.” 

Zack’s kitchen was littered with half-finished crossword puzzles and gunky dishes and flea market knick knacks. Zack’s dad Ed chain smoked by the window in his old rocking chair that was wrapped in a faded leather jacket with a stitched-on rebel flag. He looked 60 but seemed older when he started hacking. When he coughed it sounded like his lungs were filled with semi-liquified rusty nails, and the daily battle to expel bits of them from his chest was violent enough to wake up Kurt when he spent the night. 

“That Kurt?” Ed said. 

“Yes sir,” Zack said.

“Tell’m he ought to grow a pair,” Ed laughed.

Kurt watched him smoke the filterless Marlboro. It was more of a suck than a smoke; he economically snatched as much nicotine as he could hold in a shallow breath. It took him seven inhales before the cigarette was gone. He jabbed it into one of the several ashtrays on the counter, each filled with identically crinkled butts. 

Kurt and Zack walked down to the basement. In the room next to him there were two computers and a television set up on plastic buffet tables that seemed close to buckling from the weight. Automatically they both got on a computer. Zack commandeered the newer one because it was his house.

Zack’s older brother Rick lived in other basement room. He busted through the door. “What’s up boys?” he said.

“Not shit,” Zack said.

“That little girlfriend of yours coming over today?” 

“In a little bit.”

“You finger her yet? I remember when I was your age and that was the fuckin’ threshold,” Rick said. 

“Not yet, but I’ll try today,” Zack said.

Zack and Kurt idolized Rick. He was 22, and sometimes Zack and Kurt could hear him having sex with his girlfriend in the next room. Sometimes he would let them see his box of condoms, and they would be in awe. Kurt was unsure of why Rick still lived there. ‘Some unsuccessful business venture,’ or something. When Kurt came over Rick would hang out with them regularly, mimicking George’s salivating problem or joking about how fat Phil was. 

Before either of them started typing Kurt was already dreaming. Her name was Alex, but to him she was just the one who lived with him in his head, smoking cigarettes by the river and talking about movies that Kurt pretended to understand. Zack slapped him on the shoulder.

“Did you hear me? Alex is coming over. We’re going to the River Rapids.”

“All right,” Kurt said.

Kurt sighed and slumped down into the scoliosis-induced hunchback posture he constantly tried to hide. He had become a part of a begrudging three-person dynamic that started a month earlier at River Rapids, a rundown water park that became the City of Tweens in the summer when kids too young to drive got dropped off there. The water slides lost their appeal early on; the big draw of the park was its escape from adult supervision, its temporary illusion of autonomy. When Kurt pictured it, he saw hoards of bikini-clad preteens standing on wet concrete, cackling at a girl in a one-piece. 

Kurt kept replaying the day. It was the first day after school let out, and he met Zack at the food court surrounded by the Lazy River. Zack was with Alex and two other girls, but he didn’t introduce them. He said “Ready to f------ with some lifeguards?” and they started walking. Alex’s black bikini had skulls on it. She walked next to Kurt for a minute silently. They measured their steps consciously so that they would line up. Kurt tried to recall what they said to each other, but couldn’t: she was just smiling and tussling his hair like she did in the treehouse. She was a rebel, she had small ears, she understood the things that Kurt felt cooking in his head but couldn’t explain, she lived outside of the world. 

Usually he stopped his head from replaying here, but he decided to let it keep going. Some time later he and Zack were in their floral board shorts in the back of Kurt’s mom’s SUV on the way to River Rapids. Kurt felt like his fever dreams of Alex were overflowing, and he needed to release them. He started to feel sweat bead on his forehead.

“You know that girl?” Kurt said.

“What girl?” Zack said.

“Alex, I think was her name.”

“Yeah, Alex, what about her?”

“I was thinking about asking her...”

Zack perked up. “Asking her what?

“Out, on a date, or whatever.”

“You’re going to ask her out?” Zack was smirking. “You do that, tell me how it goes.”

“You think she’ll say yes?”

“Not sure, buddy, but you should definitely give it a shot.”

Kurt felt himself get closer to the picture in his head, and it made his heart palpitate. Kurt and Zack met up with several of their friends, and they all sat on a curb by the lockers. 

“There’s your woman now, Kurt,” Zack said. He pointed across the sidewalk to Alex, who was sitting at a table with two other girls. “Are you going to ask her or puss out?” 

Kurt stood up triumphant from the curb, walked towards her. He felt his heart beating in his eyes. He sat down at the only open chair at the table without saying anything. Ten seconds passed. Alex looked at her friends quizzically and laughed. 

“Ummm. What’s up?”

“Hey, what’s up,” Kurt said. He looked over at Zack and his friends. Zack was hyperventilating, red from laughter. The rest were staring intently at Kurt.

“You’re the one that sat down,” Alex said.

“Oh, yeah. I was wondering... I was wondering if you wanted to go out or something.”

Alex’s eyebrows went up and she looked glanced at her friends. “Awww. You’re asking me out? You just asked me out. That’s so sweet of you. That’s really sweet. I’m sorry, but I have a boyfriend now. Your friend Zack actually asked me out yesterday and I said yes.”

Zack was rolling on the ground. 

“Oh, g-gotcha, OK,” Kurt said. 

Kurt wandered out of the entrance into the parking lot in a daze, waited there for hours until his mom picked he and Zack up. “Dude,” Zack said, getting into the car. “It was a joke.”

“It’s cool,” Kurt said. And that was it.

Kurt knew that his fever dream had grown unhealthy. He had spent dozens of hours with Zack and Alex. He had almost completely separated himself from her, but he still grew closer to the her that lived in his head. He nearly ignored her when she talked. Her voice was just a template for his story, where they smoked cigarettes and stole beer from convenience stores and protested oppressive leaders. 

Kurt snapped out of it. Rick was clipping his toenails.

“How are you, bud?” Rick said. 

“I’m all right. You?” Kurt said.

“Well, I’m trying, you know? I’m trying.”

There was a long silence.

“Trying to do what?” Kurt said.

“That’s why I like you, bud. You ask questions. I’m...trying to get better.” 

“Is it working?”

“It’s real hard, but you just gotta do it. First time in how long you’ve seen me in a shirt with sleeves?”

“That’s true.”

Zack’s phone vibrated. “Alex is here. I’ll get this out of the way.”

Zack cracked his knuckles and walked up the stairs. Rick sat down at the computer. He and Kurt sat silent for a few minutes; it was a comfortable silence, and Kurt felt no need to add to the clicks of the keyboards with unnecessary conversation. It was the first time in as long as he could remember in which he felt that occupying space with someone else was enough.

“So how do you like Zack’s girl?” Rick finally said.

“I like her.”

“Yeah? Green haired little freak, right?”

“I guess.” Kurt took a deep breath. He needed to get the story out of his head again. “I asked her to go out with me. Zack didn’t tell me they were already were.”

“And he knew you were going to ask her?” Rick sighed. “Zack’s a fucker you know that, right? How you haven’t kicked his ass once or twice yet is a constant amazement to me.”

“Yeah, I guess I know. That he’s a fucker.” 

“You just need to stop being a little fruit. You know?”

“Not really.”

Zack opened the stairway door and snickered into the room. He was holding two fingers up. “I did it. I fingered her.”

Rick sighed. Kurt could feel his heart beat in his eyes again.

“Kurt, you hear me? I fingered her.” Zack slapped Kurt across the face with the hand he was holding up. Kurt put his hand to his face and could feel it, slimy and pungent. 

Rick kicked back his chair so that its corner punctured the thin drywall. He yanked Zack into the air by his collar, jerked him back and forth until Zack's shirt ripped and he crumbled to the ground. Rick picked back Zack onto his feet, grabbed him by the back of the head, and threw him headfirst into the plastic buffet table. The table collapsed when Zack's skull bashed against it, and the old, bulky computer crunched Zack’s ribs. He started to wheeze.

“Fuck you,” Zack kept saying.

Rick was beat red, yelling four inches from Zack’s face, spitting worse than George does. 

“Listen you fucking punk,” he screamed. “This is your friend? You’re going to treat your friends like this? You’re a fucking piece of shit, you know that? I don’t know how you turned out to be so fucking stupid, to do something like that to your friend. I don't care if he might be a little bit queer, no one deserves that. You're sure as hell not my brother, because my brother would never do something as sick as what you just did. I can't even look at you.” 

Zack was crying and wheezing. “You broke my ribs,” he said through the snot and blood that ran from his nose to his mouth and bubbled when he talked.

Rick put his head in his hands for a long take. He stared at Kurt for what seemed like a minute. Kurt stared back, unfazed, then nodded at Rick. 

Rick nodded back, and Kurt heard Rick's boots calmly clack against the wood stairs as he left without a word before gingerly shutting the upstairs door. 

“Please call someone,” Zack said. 

Kurt looked at Zack. He was back in his fever dream again, but there was no girl in it. He was still pierced and covered in tattoos. He came back to the same 7/11 and shattered its window with a brick. The quick-stop caught fire. He stood in front of it, watching it burn, and it all meant something, it all meant something that was bigger than Kurt, something that he could write down and read to a coalition of freaks in a rundown warehouse.

Kurt got up from the computer and stood next to Zack, who was a pile of mucous and oversized clothes. Kurt grabbed the windowsill for leverage and looked out the window at the old man in the yard over drinking a 40 on a beach towel, holding foil up to tan his leathered face. Kurt raised his foot and let it drop into Zack's gut. Zack started hacking like his dad did, but more violent, and kept saying “fuck you,” over and over. Kurt kicked him again, harder, and began to like the difference between his hard sole and Zack's soft stomach. He stomped on it repeatedly. Kurt wanted to tell Zack that Zack shouldn't have done what he did, but he figured Zack knew that by what was happening. Kurt liked that he didn't have to say anything.

Kurt felt like he was crying but there were no tears. He walked up the stairs, ignored Zack’s yelping. The house was empty, except for Alex. She was sitting in Ed's rocking chair, staring vacantly at the old neighbor.

“You all right?” Kurt said.

“I'll be fine.”

They sat for a long take, bathed in the pink-orange hue of dusk that made the kitchen glow.

“So, you really like Zack?” 

“Not that much, really. I haven't found anything here worth liking that much.""

Kurt took two cigarettes out of Ed's mint pack of Reds. He handed one to Alex, and she took it without hesitation. He sparked a match on his shoe and lit both in one motion. Silent, they watched the last silvery sliver of sun descend past the neighboring cul-de-sac's edge. Kurt let his cigarette dangle from the corner of his mouth like Clint Eastwood and told Alex about some movies he'd seen that could take them somewhere new.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1fntk9,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fntk9/that_place_outside_of_arkansas/,

“I hate this place” Tayler mumbled grumpily.

“Shush, we are just going in for a minute. I need to grab some things” his sister replied.

Tayler looked up at the once beautiful house, now ugly and decrepit. It had been in his family for generations, ever since people still owned slaves. Beside the house was rows and rows of wild cotton plants. An overgrown mess that used to be the salvation of his family. That was a long time ago. Tayler and his sister walked up the old white washed steps that creaked with old age. 

He ran his hand down the old door before opening it. How many people walked through that threshold? How many broken souls served this house? They walked inside onto the mat that covered the hardwood flooring and up the steep stairs. He remembered from his young childhood stories the townspeople told about when his great grandparents lived in the house. A coloured maid had tripped down the stairs and broke her neck. Stories about her ghost were scattered across the town. One night Tayler had tried to stay up at the bottom of the stairs, hoping to see the young maid walk down the stairs late one night, still trying to care for the house that she had been brought up in to serve. Tayler fell asleep and never saw her. 

They walked down a small hall, covered with old black and white photos of each generation. At the end of the hall was his family. The photo was once beautiful, but now only showed hollow smiles. His sister opened up a bedroom door, and in the room was a small cot, it’s blankets full of holes from hungry moths. Had they really been gone that long? His sister bent down by the wall and started to lift a loose board from out of the floor. Under the board was an old dusty lunchbox, His sister trailed her fingers through the dust, before opening the latch and revealing it’s contents. Four dollars in change and something wadded up in a handkerchief. Probably something that long ago meant something to her. She stood up to face Tayler, tears in her eyes. He pursed his lips and pulled her towards him, to nestle her in his arms. She hugged him tightly, and sniffled quietly before turning away. This house was full of many memories for both of them. Many memories, but none of them good. This house was tainted with despair. 

Generations of sadness and slavery that left an unpleasant taste in Tayler’s mouth. He grabbed hold of his sisters hand, and they slowly walked down the hall, down the stairs and out the door into the rising sun. They walked past the fields of wasted fortune and down the winded road, closer and closer to the sun each step. They stopped at the top of a grassy field, the only place where good memories were kept of them. Tayler closed his eyes as he remembered his sister and him running up and down the hill. His memories clear as day. He opened them to watch with his sister the inching of the sun. First hitting his spit shined boots, then his sky blue trousers, pressed to perfection. Then his belt buckle, and his uniform’s jacket, the medals on his breast shining with honer. He squinted to look at his sister while the sun hit his eyes, melting away the scenes of the civil war and replacing them with his sisters smile. He watched as she stared into the sun, finding enlightenment. Her brunette spit curls shining with health. He looked down to see with her other hand she was clenching onto the skirt of her worn flower print dress. Blood no longer covered her dress, no wound from a northern generals bayonet. She looked just as much as a Southern Bell as she did before the war. Tayler ran his fingers through his hair with surprise, feeling there was no longer a bullet wound on the side of his head. It was time to say goodbye to their bad memories. Memories that were fading away while the sun passed over them. 

He watched his sister start to fade into the background. He looked down at himself, his medals along with his body disappearing. A happiness spread around himself and the top of the hill was left with nothing but aged stories.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1fi4lh,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fi4lh/tainted/,

Her cheeks were swollen in the cold and her rose coloured nose told the tale of the day that we had just spent walking this coastline and making up stories of growing old together.  She belonged there.  It was as if the streets were there exclusively for her, new pebbles erecting with every stride she took as we walked arm in arm, the algid air biting at our necks, synonymous with ourselves.
	I didn't belong there. There were no pines, save for the needles that drew lines in her palms.  I could have told myself that this was where it should end, that the closest place to home was be her broken skin.  She looked at me with half smile that made me stutter and I could smell spring on her breath as she leaned closer, hopeful for a moment of warmth.
	Like some sort of beacon, I looked past her silver hair that mimicked the swelling ocean and saw my liberation. Haunting steam rose like an apparition from the tops of the train engines as they bellowed to the world news of their impending departure, apathetic to whether or not anyone was listening. I knew that right then I had to break away. With her palm in mine and her cheeks begging for a hearth, my lips trembled as my words stumbled over themselves and she gave me a look with her glassy doe eyes that would have brought my to my knees if they weren't too frozen to fold.  As she stared to me or through me, I couldn't tell, the ocean behind her mocked her filling eyes, and I knew that she knew.  
	Through a brief instance of mutual understanding, and an unspoken reassurance that this would not be where it ended, I noticed that she was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.  She looked down on me with those big red eyes, oh it was scary, and I yelled ""What do you want from me monster?!"", and it bent down and said ""I need to borrow about treefiddy"".

He finds it and switches on the dim, yellow lights, the naked bulbs flickered in the darkness, illuminating the room. A wine red couch. He hates it, it is lumpy, and smells musty. A small kitchen, with one cup, one fork, and one knife, he doesn't need anything else. No decorations, just off-white wall, the ceiling is satined yellow from cigarette smoke. He always smokes. He goes into the kitchen and grabs what’s left in the fridge. A cheap beer, bread, and cream cheese. The beer is warm and the cream cheese is turning green. He steers his knife around the cream cheese and spreads it on the bread. It tastes bad, the stale bread and moldy cream cheese. He realizes with a sudden calm that this is his last meal. Ironic, that his last meal is like his life, doesn't look to good, but you have hope. Then you take a bite and it’s gone. Both the hope and your appetite. He chuckles at his joke. A solitary tear forms in his right eye and slides down his cheek. He doesn't wipe it away. He walks over to his desk, one of the two pieces of furniture in his house, the other is his closet. He opens the desk and pulls out his gun. He bought it yesterday. It glistens in the sulphur yellow light. He takes the single bullet he bought and slips it quietly into the chamber. He cocks it, and puts it in his mouth. He tastes metal, the oil, and his own blood. The metal scrapes against his teeth. He thinks about the mess he is going to make for the person who has to clean it up. Not how pathetic his life is, or how he much he hates himself, or that he has nobody in his life. But he does think that he doesn't have to shock his landlord to walk inside and see him. She is a frail old lady. It would kill him to do that to her. He flicks the safety on, and puts it in his pocket. He walks outside. It’s raining outside, he shivers, but he doesn't need to be warm now. He walks for an hour, until he gets to the bridge. It’s a huge bridge, the water rushes underneath, black as night. No cars drive by, he looks at his watch: 2:56. As he steps onto the ledge, he is happy, whatever happens now, has to be better then this.  He flicks his cigarette away, the glowing orange butt fades as it falls away into the churning water. He leans out across the water, feeling the wind whip around him. He releases from the railing, he thinks, as he is falling towards the water. ‘It’s my birthday.’

Grandpa Adam scowled. ""In my day, we kept our private lives private"" he said as his FaceGoogle posted this as his latest status; ""and we kept our private parts private too."" - he motioned to the boob-tube hotpants combo his 14 year-old grandson was sporting.

At the end of the rows of graves, I found a hole in the ground too deep to see the bottom. A gravestone bearing my name with no number lay at the head.

A jackrabbit darted across the highway and Bill winced at the soft bump as it disappeared under his front left tire; he felt like a murderer. He stopped the car a couple of miles up the road - far enough away from the jackrabbit that it would be invisible to him even in the light. As he pulled to a halt the engine of his ancient car spluttered, disturbing a rattlesnake that was curled up by the side of the road. It gave a disapproving hiss and slithered off into the night. He clicked the engine off, got out and looked at the sky.

There was no moon, and the stars seemed duller than usual.

Bill looked up at the sky for a long time. Trying to remember. Remember where he had come from, and where he was going, and why. But the stars had no answers for him. They simply twinkled silently, not saying a word, just pale unhelpful dots of burning hydrogen billions of miles away.

He tore his eyes away from the stars and looked back at his car. In the pitch black night it was difficult to discern its color; Bill thought it was red but he couldn't be sure. He sighed and climbed back inside, sat down in the driver's seat, and rested his muddled head against the steering wheel.

The human mind, he thought, was a funny thing. It could remember obscure and useless facts and the names of people you've only met once and birthday parties you went to thirty years ago. But it could forget what you walked into a room for. Or why you drove into the middle of the desert, on a night where there was no moon and the stars seemed duller than usual.

Bill restarted the car and checked the rear-view mirror, and suddenly he remembered where he was going. And why.

He stepped back outside, smiling faintly at his own forgetfulness. The keys stayed in the ignition; he needed the lights to stay on because it was darker than usual tonight.

He opened the door to the backseat and dragged the corpse out into the desert, to about half a mile from the road. He left it there for the coyotes to find in the morning. 

As he walked back to his car Bill looked up at the sky and noticed that there was no moon, and the stars seemed duller than usual.

Not too far from town but still far enough that our neighbors are a 5 minute drive away, regardless of this we will know them well and we will invite eachothers to partys, bake carrot cake and pumpkin muffins with veges I pulled from the garden patch you put in last summer. 
They will always be a little gritty but while they're still warm with a little butter your mother had made they're Saturday morning cake stall worthy which is a-okay because the whole batch would be demolished before they had the chance to get cold. 

There will be an endless landscape of trees and shrubs and some wirerly gorse I always say I will pull out but never get around to that hides a little stream and a lake not to far off our property that backs into the complete wilderness. We will always be getting the odd stoat into the chicken pen, which although sad, isn't a huge deal and we're left wondering why those cheeky creatures bother staking out the pen in the first place as I never close the hatch door and they're always roaming free, pecking away at the dirt for worms. 

We will have a couple of cats, one that we claim came with the house and a few others including that temperamental ginger tom your sister asked us to mind while she was out of state but just fell oh-so-in-love with the with the big city she had to stay and we kept him on full time.
We will have a few dogs too, never any less than two. They will be mutts that we picked up along the way and the runt from the first litter before we got the old girl fixed because you said he reminded you of yourself as a child so we had to keep. They will be allowed to sit on the furniture and sleep on the edge of the bed but it wont matter because it was all second hand from the salvation army or motley, garish stuff we found on the side of the road. Full of cigarette burns and the smell of a couch well loved in more ways than one. 

I will have quit smoking tobacco by then but will obviously favour my dope plant over all my other flowers and I will check it several times a day expecting some new bud to have flourished while I was off baking the bread or getting lost in a foreign film I bought when we first met because I wanted to show you I was artsy. I will turn the leaves into curious cookies I offer to our friends who will gladly accept because, hey, free dope. They wont taste that bad although maybe slightly burnt on the bottom but that's okay because it's come to be expected from our ancient oven that never learned how to fully utilize the fan feature. 

You will call our house cozy although I will call it delicate and the narow stairwell up to our loft bed will full a sense of childlike wonder every time I climb up after you've been long asleep, silently humming the words to rupunzel and her tower in my head. The old wooden frame will murmer with any movement and the seemingly endless nooks and crannys will be fulled with spiders webs I refuse to suck up with the vacuume cleaner because spiders have feelings too and a special kind of respect that can only come from being and elder.
It will smell of the incense I insit on burning almost constantly and the wood smoke from the fire we have burning in winter but never really goes away in summer.

Sometimes we will make sweet love wrapped in our sheets, guiding ourselves deeper into eachothers bodys with a hunger that's almost insatiable.
Other times we will fuck. Those are the times I'm watching you over sultry eyes as you cut the wood in the backyard and as I make you a nice cuppa to refresh you after your hard work you will grab my hips and wisper in my ear 'bend over' as you throw all inhibitions aside and taste me with loud gasps and moans, taking me against the table and kissing me like you mean it. 

The summers will be far too hot and the winters far too cold but we will never complain as we are always prepared with and iced tea and a spliff (I started smoking tobacco again but only with pot) or a generous glass of merlot by the fire. 

We will laugh fondly at the mistakes we made and shared together and separately and I will stop caring about my weight and call my mother more often. I will invite my dad over for tea and he will politely drink our sad attempt at home brewed beer because he loves me and wants to show he approves of our lifestyle. 

We will still have sad political yearnings but I will have over come my bitter youth and we will connect all over again with photographs of our mohawks and tartan pants with knee high docs and exemplary teenage ""fuck you"" attitude.
We will gossip less and listen more realizing that life isn't worth worrying about who's screwing who. 

We will spend most of our time laughing and some of our time crying because crying is important too and we will always know how to cheer each other up even if we are the cause of each others problems but we will never be miserable because we simply just don't have time for such nonsense.  I will have learned to love myself and my flaws as well as holding yours precious.

I will flirt with natural therapy and Buddhist ideals while you read Oscar Wilde and Virgina Wolfe and we will appreciate life, our hardships and the really, truly, wonderfully, undying, confusing, muddling, joyous bedazzlement that is this is life. 

We will live in the bush.

I have walked this path for as long as I can remember. The days and nights blend together, into slurry of marching feet. There are others who walk on this endless journey. Ahead of me, and behind me, the millions fade into the distance. Occasionally, one will fall. Some are picked up by the ones who walk with them. Some, they pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and continue on their journey. But some don't get back up. They lie in the dirt, motionless. The others walk around them, either oblivious to their plight, or simply numb to their existence. We walk on, and they disappear from sight. I have looked to both horizons, for days at a time, but they are never there. Those that fall and do not get up simply disappear. We walk this path, the sound of thousands of feet meshing into a cacophony of sound.

I grow tired of this journey. Every day I feel myself grow a little weaker, a little slower. The constant sound of feet hitting the ground, this marching drumbeat, lulls me. I just wish to sleep, to rest my head. So I lie down, on the side of the road. I will not be long, for all I wish to do is rest. Just for a little while. The others continue on, marching on the same path that is the only thing they have known. But I must rest. I lay my head to the ground, and close my eyes. I must rest, if only to regain enough strength to continue on.

Suddenly, there is a shift. The sound is not the same as it was before. I open my eyes, and look up. Someone has stopped. Why? She is staring at me with piercing blue eyes. Why is she staring at me? Why can’t I simply rest? A voice. She is speaking.

“Why are you laying there?”

Isn’t it obvious? I am tired. I wish to sleep. And you are bothering me. Let me rest.

“No one who lies down does so simply because they are tired.”

Well, I have. I want to rest. I want to be left alone to my sleep. The others have left me here, and now I just want to close my eyes and see no longer.

She looks at me puzzlingly, as if I were some piece in a museum that hadn’t been there before. She won’t just go away and let me sleep, but I don’t want to get up to shoo her away. I’m just tired, and all I want to do is be left alone so that I can finally rest. This road goes on, never-ending, and I am sick of the constant walking. I’m sick of the unwavering pace. All I want to do is rest. Is that such a crime? She is speaking again.

“You know, I tried to lay down once. All I wanted to do was rest. But then someone stopped, and made me get up. They wouldn’t let me sleep.”

What is she talking about? Is she one of those who fell? Is she one of the ones who were pulled back up? I have never seen her before, but I am certain that I saw all of those who fell. My mind is buzzing with questions. Distracting, confusing questions that only keep me from sleep. And still she is talking. And still she is explaining.

“… and so they told me, 'if you stay here, the wolves will find you.' But I did not care. But he did. And he did not let me stay. He told me, 'if you are too weak to walk, I will help you. If you are too tired to walk, I will carry you. But I will not leave you to the wolves.'”

The wolves? I have never seen a wolf. I have seen nothing on this trail but the vast expanse of nothingness that rings it on both sides. But she is persistent. I have never had another on this trail interact with me in this way before. I do not know how to respond. So I tell her,
“I am tired. Just let me sleep.”

She cocks her head to the side. Her mouth forms the shape of a small ‘o’. As she stands there, I notice that the people on the trail have become a blur. All of them are slowly disappearing into a mist. All of them but her.

“If you are weak, then I will help you walk. If you are tired, then I will carry you. But I will not leave you to the wolves.”

How? How could this person show such care to one which they have never met? Slowly, shakily, she helps me to my feet. A mix of emotions flow through me. This girl has decided that I am worth helping. This girl has decided that I should be alive. I feel a wave of emotion wash over me. I have never felt like this before. I have never felt this warm feeling. The aches in my bones, the sleep in my eyes, the haze in my brain, all of it starts to disappear.

I continue to walk this path, day after day, night after night. When I grow tired, the others help keep me on the path. I am grateful for the help of strangers. Of people who had every right to ignore my existence. I walk along this path, but I no longer feel tired. My steps are no longer weak, no longer slow. They have given me a purpose that I previously lacked.

I walk along the path. A man falls to the ground, just off the side. Others walk around him, either oblivious to his plight, or numb to his existence. I stop in my tracks. Looking directly at him, I ask,
“Why are you laying there?”

Isn’t it obvious? He is tired. He wishes to sleep.

“Why are you bothering me?”

I smile to myself.

“Because you cannot sleep. The path may be long, and you may be tired, but you have been walking alone this whole time. I cannot allow you to stop here.”

He looks at me.

“Why?”

My mind goes through the many memories of my time on this path. Of those who I have met, and those whom I have walked with. I know why he must walk the path, but he will need to find out for himself.

“If you are weak, I will help you walk. If you are tired, I will carry you.”

Wikileaks revealed today that Kevin Systrom cofounder of popular smartphone Instagram has been exposed as an undercover agent from the United States Department of Health. The app was designed to encourage public health and better eating habits. Instagram is a popular smartphone app designed for taking, editing and sharing pictures of ones food. Researchers from the Department of Health believed that the apps users would prepare and eat healthier meals to avoid negative reactions from other users in regards to their eating habits. 

When asked about this one of the apps users noted that he would often find pictures of healthy food online, share them with Instagram and then order double bacon cheeseburgers from a popular fast food chain. Whether or not the app has had a positive impact on it’s user’s health has yet to be determined but sources tell us studies are currently underway.

Society told Peter that this was unacceptable. It was now up to Peter to make everything alright for his friend- to tell him well-thought-out lies to keep him happy and sane. They spoke their lies to each other over text message:

“I don’t believe in much. Really, I believe in almost nothing. But I do believe in hope. A tiny light within you and everyone else, that can never be crushed. If you never let go of your tiny light of humanity- if you just hold on to the light you have inside of you- more positive things will happen in your life, as a direct result of your positive thinking.” -Peter wrote that.

**These were all lies.** Peter’s friend thanked him profusely, and in tears, although Peter would never know, because they were not talking in person. Hardly ever did Peter, or most people his age, talk in person. They prefered to confuse each other through text, and not go through the grueling process of true empathy or compassion. Peter’s friend loved everything that Peter had to say, said Peter’s friend’s phone in a text message. He believed Peter, even if Peter did not believe himself. That night one of them went to sleep.

This is how the day went according to Peter’s mind that night:

I wonder what her face looked like after the crash.

“A good pen can write 50,000 words.” 
""She was the warmest, most fun-loving woman I have ever met.""
She kissed my legs all the way up, starting at the feet. A shiver went through my body.
“The horrific crash, which happened at about 10:45 Monday morning, killed the victim and closed that stretch of the road for nearly 10 hours while investigators combed the scene.”
“-sometimes more of a friend than a mother.”

  The moment was brief. It happened near the finish line. People were watching the runners run to the line. Fathers cheered their daughters and sisters cheered their brothers and sons were proud of their moms. Even strangers watched and they were proud of them all. There was sun and Coca-Cola and everyone was clapping because the day was important. The running was important. Old wives stood and cheered, 'Yay!' in ripe honeydew voices. Their husbands clapped strong hands and remembered a time.

 And then it happened. 'BANG!'

  At first there was disbelief and smoke and echo. So many stunned runners just stood and they did not run. Some runners had been knocked down by the force of the blast.  They used tired legs to get back up. 

But the spectators were finding themselves disoriented, bleeding. 
 
Slowly, people came to and noticed the way about things. 

  A woman picked herself up from the concrete and looked to find her sunglasses. She found them, and they were not broken. Then, looking in the lenses, she saw that she was bleeding from her head.

 A man took his daughter's hand and started walking for the car. He kept hurrying and looking back to the cloud of light-grey smoke. He said, 'A bomb,' when the little girl asked him something and then she asked another question and he said, 'I don't know, baby.'
  
  A mother was sitting up on the sidewalk to see that she had no legs. The mother saw her no legs and looked for her kids. Then she knew the suffocating pain, but she was scared because she could not see the kids. And she screamed for the kids, which hurt. She wanted to vomit, and she almost did.  She could not hear. She could only feel the pain and the burning pepper in her nose and the cement on her back and the burning of her feet. But she yelled for the kids and then she saw a younger man moving swiftly through time. He emerged from a changing sea of empty changing colors. He moved at her and she noticed his face was round and plain with sweat glistening on his forehead and eyes that were blue and frozen calm. And then she saw nothing but she reached her arms out hoping to feel her kids. She felt his hands but she tried to fight him. Then she saw nothing and moved nothing.

The children saw their mother but the loud noise had been so loud that they could not hear and they could only watch their mother bleeding and yelling like an animal. The children watched as one, then two, then more surrounded their mom who was hurt. 

  The people swarmed her, and all the kids saw were backs and the bottoms of shoes. The children saw the blood creeping past shards of glass and little pebbles. It snaked towards their shoes. They treated it like lava. The oldest child was crying and he was scared, but he grabbed the other two and let them cry. They stood there next to the wall and cried big gulping wails. A nice lady came then and asked, 'Is that your mom?'

 Sirens were pulsing out in odd rhythms and men were calling over this special music and people were rushing past people rushing past people rushing. The pepper smoke was faint in the air, but it was burned into every nose. There was a dog pulling his own leash through the street.

A man stumbled past a trash can and towards a cluster of people stopped, looking. He was empty and lost because he knew nothing about himself, but he knew he knew what had happened. He looked at the lookers and he said, flailing his arms, 'It just went, 'BANG!' You know?! Just like that. And, just look!' He pointed at the place where the bomb had been, where the lookers had been looking. And he said this over again at the people, 'It just went, 'BANG!' And he wondered if he believed it. 'Just, 'BANG!' Like that!' 

One of the lookers came over to him and put her arms around him. She gave him her water. 'It was just like, 'BANG!' he said, and she said softly, 'I know.'

It was an open and shut case, and defense attorney Ramona Rogers was feeling great. This was her first real day with the firm, and she knew that a good showing in this trial would guarantee her future as a lawyer. The case was Wagner et. al. vs. City of Oklahoma Housing Projects. A Mr. Ronald Wagner had sued the housing project over alleged negligence in a fire that started in one of the housing units. 

Evidence and testimony all pointed to an old lady in one of the apartments; she had fallen asleep with a lit cigarette in her mouth—several lit cigarettes—and a fire erupted shortly thereafter. Wagner and the related claimants tried to point to the Housing Supervisors as culpable, claiming that the fire had spread as a result of faulty construction and bad management, but the accusation just didn’t stick. Ramona had successfully dragged out in a cross examination that the fire was mostly confined to the old lady’s apartment, and that there was scarcely evidence of it affecting the other tenants. Indeed, an examination of the site showed little to suggest that the flames had spread beyond the confines of the one apartment.

Ramona couldn’t wait till the verdict came in. “Not Guilty”, the jurors would rule, and she’d be off for drinks with the legal partners, who would almost certainly suggest that she receive a raise and be put on track to be a partner in a year or two. She smiled as she thought of her name on the firm, and the plush office they’d give her. She’d have bookcases full of ornate-looking books which she’d never read, and leather chairs for her clients to sit in—the kind that you’d always see in film adaptations of John Grisham novels.

And then the prosecution announced a surprise witness. The court became silent as the Judge ordered the bailiff:

“Bring in Kimberly Wilkins.”

The Bailiff mirrored the Judge’s order, shouting:
“Bring in Ms. Kimberly Wilkins.”

The courtroom became as quiet as a sepulcher. A woman wearing a wrap over her hair and a multicolored tank-top emerged from one of the chambers and made her way to the witness stand, sauntering all the while. She carried herself with the air of a brothel matron and greeted the Judge with a wide grin. She had a gold tooth that glistened in harsh light of the court. 

She took the oath, the Prosecutor intoning the order which she would repeat: “Kimberly Wilkins, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?”

“Sure thing!” she replied.

The Prosecutor gave her a cordial wink and began his questioning.

“Ms. Wilkins--”

“You can call me Sweet Brown, Mr. Prosecutor.” she added.

“…Sweet Brown, can you tell me what you were doing at two AM on the night of April the seventh?”

“Well,” she began in a husky voice, “I woke up to go get me a cold pop.”

“Describe the situation in your apartment at this time” 

“Then I thought somebody was barbecuing!”

“This was, in fact, the fire?” 

She nodded. 

“How did you react?”

“I said ‘oh lord Jesus it’s a fire!’”

Ramona was stunned. There was something very off about this witness. If she didn’t act soon, the entire momentum of the case could conceivably be reversed. 

In a panic she screamed out “Objection!”

“Grounds?” the Judge asked sternly.

Flustered and at a loss for words, Ramona replied “there is no evidence to suggest that what the witness perceived to be a fire was anything but, as she suggests, barbecuing?”

The Judge, Sweet Brown, the Prosecutor, indeed all eyes in the room turned incredulously to Ramona. 

“Barbecuing at 2 AM, counsel?” barked the Judge, who then gave a nod to the Prosecutor. “I’ll allow it.” 

The Prosecutor continued. “Would you say that the fire compelled an urgent response from you?”

“I didn’t grab no shoes or nothing Jesus! I ran for my life!”

“And were you able to escape, or….”

“And then the smoke got me!” Brown hurriedly interjected.

The Prosecutor smiled. He knew this represented a turnabout, a reversal in the case. There had been no evidence that the fire was anything but isolated, but if the smoke had reached Wilkins’ apartment then there was clearly something more serious at hand.

“Your witness, counselor” muttered the Judge.

Ramona stood up, a cold sweat breaking out around her forehead and her underarms. She would have to do anything to diminish the significance of Wilkins’ claims, paint them as trivial.

“Ms. Wilkins,” she began, her voice regaining some confidence, “would you say that the smoke was of any dire consequence to your health or well-being? Would you say that it was anything but a small and fairly non-hazardous discharge, as opposed to what one might find in something such as a three-alarm fire?”

Sweet Brown looked at Ramona with disgust, her head rearing backwards, coiling like a cobra preparing to strike. Her eyes became wide, bug-like.

“I got bronchitis!” she spouted, an almost playfully-indignant expression filling her face. 

“I understand, Ms. Wilkins, but don’t you think…”

“Ain’t nobody got time for that!” Sweet Brown interrupted. 

Silence followed, the courtroom became still. It seemed like time had frozen. And then, gradually, applause emerged. The audience—and the jurors—were cheering for Sweet Brown. Even the Judge was amused: the corners of his grim mouth were gradually creeping upwards. 

Sweet Brown was emboldened by the attention and flashed a toothy grin, bobbing her head up and down in delight.

By the end of the day, Ramona Rogers was searching through the classified section of the newspaper and rummaging her business cards in search of a new job. She’d be defeated, and lost what was supposed to be the simplest case ever, thanks to the might of Sweet Brown.

John woke up in his humble New York apartment, next to his wife, Charlotte. He sluggishly rose from his bed and stumbled into the kitchen. He opened his refrigerator, and reached for a carton of milk. He brought the carton to his lips, and drank a few sips before stuffing in back into the fridge. He put on his casual Sunday suit, as usual, and walked out the door. He was in a hurry, grooming his hair while walking down the stairs to the lobby of the apartment complex.

""Good morning, Mr. Galotto!""

""Nice to see you, Mary.""

He walked out the doors too the street and go to the parking lot, opening the door to his Ford Model A. He drove down the street, making his way too the Fanchetti house. The Don told he had a big job today, and he didn't plan on disappointing the Don.

He had been at Kingston, a bar downtown earlier that night with some of his friends. It was late now and they had all retired, Emilio was all alone. He had nowhere to go and nothing to do, for once he was a free man unemployed but free. All his life he had been told what to do and forced down a road he didn't really want to go down but that was all over, it was his life now. Before Emilio realized the gift he was given it had been one of the worst days of his life, he had been fired. Emilio had a good job as a mid level manager working at an IT firm but the economy had taken its toll on the business and he was no longer needed. His first thoughts were how was he going to find a new job in this mess but after a long night of drinking and smoking his eyes had been opened. Why walk in a straight line from A to B day after day when theres a whole alphabet waiting to be explored, why live as a robot day in and day out repeating the same thing over and over. Break the routine and take a stand, this is not the life to live. Emilio knew what he had to do, life was just beginning.

Emilio froze with fear, ""Can't you hear me! Give me everything yo've got, and I'm not going to say it again!"", the gun man yelled. Emilio unfroze and reached for his pockets but having spent most of his money at the bar only had a small amount of change on him. He raced through his pockets and held the money out, ""What the fuck is this shit? All of it! Now!"", the gun man furiously yelled. Emilio stuttered ""Th th this is all I have"", ""Bullshit I know you have more, this is your last chance"", the hooded man said. ""I don't, I swear"" Emilio whimpered, ""Swear on this"", BANG! BANG!

It began almost as soon as I woke up. In fact, it was what caused my awakening. It sounded like there was something crawling within the walls of my bedroom. Mice, I thought. I rubbed my eyes and got out of bed.

I shower silently. I never understood people who listened to music or sang in the shower. Silence is what I liked. Even the sound of the running water made me cringe. The warm water pounded at my back. I felt something soft on my shoulder. I turned around quickly, a chill running up my spine. I turned down the cold water.

I tried to relax again, but the chill never went away. I stepped out of the shower and over to the sink. I pulled a razor and shaving cream out of the medicine cabinet. As I closed the cabinet, I saw the towel that was hanging up drop to the floor in the mirror. I turned around quizzically. Shaking my head and sighing, I bent down to pick up the towel and put it back on the rack just as I saw something scurry across the tiled floor to the sliver of space between the opened bathroom door and the wall. Fuck, it has to be rats. I quickly finished shaving and went downstairs to the kitchen. 

Starting a fresh pot of coffee, I tried to remember if I had any rat traps left somewhere. Maybe that would warm me up. I opened the door to the pantry and stood on my toes so I could see the contents of the top shelf. I saw the outline of something and reached my hand in. I felt around until my fingers ran into something soft. It moved just as I went to grab it. I jumped and stepped back. Instinctively, I put my hand over my chest to calm myself. I heard the last few drops dripping into the coffee pot. I poured myself a cup. As I sat, sipping at my coffee, I convinced myself that it was only my imagination. Imagination? Wow, I haven’t used that in years. It was hard for me to even remember the last time my mind wandered elsewhere. Well, there were those times when I- no, I won’t go into that.

I heard a child outside, screaming with joy. I stood up and walked to the kitchen window. Pushing back the curtain, I could see the young boy running through a sprinkler. He screamed again, causing my fist to clench and jaws to lock. There was a sudden, loud crash behind me. I whipped around to find the coffee pot lying in hundreds of pieces on the floor. How had it fallen? Did the rat knock it over? I sighed and went to the hallway closet for rags and a broom.

I threw away the broken glass, and washed the mug I had used. I decided to check the garage for something to kill this rat that kept ruining my morning. I moved past the plastic containers, which were now starting to fill up the garage, to the tools. I really needed to clean them off from the last time I used them. I rustled through a box until I found an old poison rat trap. I opened it and saw it had already been used.

I heard the clicking of heels on the driveway outside the garage door. I sighed to myself and threw the trap away. I heard the doorbell ring and started making my way to the front door. As I was closing the garage door, I felt a tug at the bottom of my pant leg. I looked down, hoping to catch the rat red-handed, but the doorbell rang again. I huffed and stomped to the front of the house. I opened the door halfway.

“Hi,” a young blonde woman was standing on the old welcome mat, smiling at me.

I opened the door fully, “Hello.”

“I just wanted to introduce myself. I just moved in next door,” she smiled and held her hand out.

I looked down at her hand for a moment, then back up to meet her eyes. I shook her hand slowly.

When she pulled away, I noticed her fidgeting with her bracelets, “Well, it was nice meeting you. If you ever need anything, don’t be afraid to ask.”

I flicked my tongue across my lips, still staring at her hands. I smiled at her, “I’ll be sure to do that.”

I closed the door silently and wiped my face with my hand. I turned around and saw grey everywhere. Rats weren’t the cause of my shake up this morning. All around me were severed hands. Shit, I left the garage door open. They began to climb up my pant legs. I tried shaking them off, but they held tight. I began swatting at them. They covered my eyes and mouth. There were just too many.

He could see nothing but white floral wallpaper.  The walls smelled dusty.  It was so unfair.  
    His mom sentenced him to time out for twenty minutes.  For twenty minutes he was supposed to stand in that corner and do nothing.  His Pokemon, Nosepicker, was just a few points away from leveling up and there he was, enduring a staring contest with dust mites.  The worst part was that he didn't even do anything to deserve it.  His mom just hated him, she favored his brother.  All she ever did was nag at him and make him go to bed early and embarrass him in front of his friends.  One time, she planted a note in his lunch that said 'I love you, Sweety Pumpkins!  Ask Sarah if she'd like to come over and play!' and there was a winky face.  Nathan sat with Sarah at lunch that day and Sarah read that note; he was the laughing stock of the whole school.  Life would have been so much better if his mom just disappeared.  
	Life went on for Nathan like that for awhile.  He chafed under his mom's curfew.  He had to bring any new girlfriend home for a very formal, very uncomfortable dinner with his mom (and no, Sarah never came for dinner).  No food upstairs, no TV before homework, no closed doors in the house.  High school came and left Nathan with an open tri-fold letter on his desk:  'Congratulations, you have been accepted to the school of your dreams.'  Those dreams finally took him far away for a long time.  
	The white floral wallpaper on the walls in the corner is even dustier now.  There are small tears in the paper and dents in the wall, though I don't know how they got there.  My fingers graze the walls.  Time has a way of marking even the most untouchable of places.  I hear my brother's voice behind me.  
	“Nathan.  It's your turn.”  
I turn from my corner and walk across the living room into the bedroom hall.  Night is falling, and the gloomy twilight from outside is creeping between closed shutters.  I don't bother knocking before I enter my mom's room.  The nurse looks up from an IV unit and twitches something into place before she leaves.  My mom is on the bed looking old.  The bitter twilight from outside turns the hills and dips of her face into valleys and canyons.  Her hair is a vacant facade, and her pinpoint pupils are seeing somewhere else.  I sit in an old white wicker chair next to the bed.  
	“Mom,” I whisper, “I'm here.  It's me, Nathan.”  A spark flashes in her eyes and my voice drops, I don't want to extinguish it.  “How are ya doin'?”  
	“Nathan?”  Her voice is the skim off the top of her vocal chords.  “Yes, Nathan.  That's my son.  He's a good boy.”  
	“I know, Mom, I—”  
	“Stubborn too, like me.  Stubborn like his mom, but such a good boy.”  
Nathan wasn't a good boy.  Nathan was resentful.  He was unappreciative and wished his mom would disappear.  He would have been glad to see the woman on the bed in front of me disintegrating into the sheets.  I hate Nathan.  
	The twilight is freezing into darkness now.  There's a lamp on the nightstand next to me, but I don't want to turn it on.  My eyes close.  I just want to hear my mom's decomposing voice.  
	“I give him everything, everything... I'd lay my life down for him.  He's my angel.”  
Now my hands search wildly on the bed for my mom's wrist.  What angel was Nathan, the brat who waited in the corner until his mom wasted away?  My fingers find the wrist; it's a twig waiting to snap.  
	Why, Nathan, did you do this to me?  You bitched and you moaned and now I am facing your punishment, this wasted woman, your dying mother.  You turned your back in some spiteful waiting game and guess what, you won, you bastard.  
	“I love you, Mom,” I say.  It's an echo of someone else's words, a desperate one-liner to flirt with the idea of never seeing her again.  
	My mom turns to me and then I know I've extinguished the spark because she croaks, “That's nice, all very nice.”",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1364926004.0,,,True,t3_1bi3xm,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1bi3xm/critique_an_exercise_in_manipulating_pov_nathan/,

On one side of the wall there is a brutal and bloody scrimmage of soldiers fighting soldiers. On the path that to the opposite direction is the base. If I went around the other side of the wall death was almost certain. If I went back to the base I would be labelled a coward, I would be ostracized and sent into solitary confinement. “For shame, for shame” they would say. “For shame, for shame” my father would say.

Wind rolled and shifted the grass, at points, in unison with the nearby ocean. And at the edge of the border between one sea and the next, a girl. Standing with her feet hanging off of the green-covered cliff, immovable as stone against the winds that battered all else around her. Even her hair, flowing messily beside her, seemed to have an aura of control, as though it was only moving because she wanted it to. The sky is a splotchy grey, almost shouting the promise of heavy rain. Somehow it seems fitting though, adding to the contrast of the image set before me. I look at it all, the chaos of nature and my last beacon of hope in the center, regarding the horizon with a sense of cautious optimism that never really left her. I look at it, and I do not see perfection. No, I see something much better. I see beauty. Perfection is a singular essence, an untainted idea of something. Anything can be perfect, and by definition, everything is. Even the most bitter disappointment, the most soul-crushing misery is perfect, as it is the one true form of that disappointment, that misery. Beauty is a title not given, judged and awarded based on a set criteria. Beauty is forged, it is earned. It is not all happiness and euphoria, it has conflict. For beauty to be real, it cannot be attempted. No great artist, writer, poet ever truly created their own works of beauty. It came to them, and they interpreted it the best they could. Beauty has faults, desymmetries, negativities. It evokes love as well as hatred. It is ever changing, molded by it's paradoxical nature. Which is why, as I see the grass sea crumble and the rock under her feet fall away into the thrashing water, I know it must be that way. She was everything I am not, an emotion where I am a void, calm when I am filled with unrest. I know I could have loved her, which is why she had to die. She was beautiful in my mind, born of a beautiful situation created from beautiful inspiration. If I had loved her, I would sacrifice reality to be with her. So I make the cliff fall, my companion falling with it as I face the truth of my decision. The painful truth is, I wouldn't have minded leaving one reality for another.

**M1911**

Daniel wakes up, his knuckles are white from clutching the bed sheets. He’s sweating. He turns on his side and checks the bedside clock. 2:17 AM. He reaches and pulls out the drawer that sits underneath the clock and blindly feels around in the dark, moving magazines and rags off of something concealed. His hand adjusts to the familiar touch of wood and cold metal. His pistol. It’s the same Colt M1911 that he survived with during three tours in the jungles of Vietnam. Content and relieved, he turns on his back and shuts his eyes, hoping that another flashback doesn’t prevent him from losing any more sleep.

A nurse enters room 34, the same room that holds Daniel captive. She’s carrying a tray of pills and a cup of water. Two pills of Prazosin and one pill of Acamprosate comprise the menu for Daniel each morning at 7:45. He drinks the water first, takes the pills second. Swallowing pills was a task previously practiced in the Marines.
        	
As Daniel stands up, the nurse brings him his cane. He places it in his right hand and begins the prolonged and pondering walk to the cafeteria. He walks steadily, although his right leg has been giving him trouble after they removed a few pieces of shrapnel that had grown infectious. As he arrives in the cafeteria, he is greeted by the same dismal faces that put together The Arizona State Veteran Home. There are men with missing appendages with IV’s attached and following them like children, and there are others who appear to have nothing wrong with them. Or so it seems.
        	
Daniel makes his way through the cafeteria and finds the same seat he claimed when he was 71, almost 6 years ago. Without asking, food is put down before Daniel and he is expected to eat it. He doesn’t though. He can never eat after a dream like he had last night.
        	
Daniel checks his wrist watch. It’s 8:37. “Good,” he thinks, “only 8 more minutes in here with these people.” Daniel spends the remaining 8 minutes like he did the first 22, listening to the same small talk among the veterans concerning which board game they want to play or how beautiful the daisies are when they’re in season.
        	
At 8:45 Daniel makes the trek back to his room. Of all the below average days Daniel has had, today seems incomparable to the rest. There’s just something about it. Unable to identify the disconcerting reason, Daniel somberly strolls back to his room in hopes of completing a 1000 piece puzzle that he’s been struggling with ever since Andrew stopped coming.
        	
Andrew was a student at a local high school. He came to see Daniel on the weekdays usually around 3. Andrew would help Daniel with puzzles, bring him food or water, but most of the time they just sat and talked. Daniel enjoyed the company of someone so young and vibrant, juxtaposed to the men who lived with Daniel in this prison. Andrew was at the Veteran Home for a school project.

The project included serving 50 hours of community service and coming up with a final video as the culmination of his service project. Unbeknownst to Daniel, Andrew’s 50 hours were dwindling and soon Andrew was left with merely 2 hours and 4 weeks left of school to complete them. Being so diligent early on gave Andrew time to get away from the nursing home towards the end of the semester, however he had to return to finish his last 2 hours and film for his video project.

Daniel was sitting at the table which held the borders of his puzzle in place. He patiently picked up pieces, tried to fit them into certain positions, almost against their will. When he deduced that the piece would not fit, he simply put it down and moved on to the next one. Just as he found a piece which fit into two others, completing the rotor of the helicopter, a baby started crying. Daniel’s eyes became unfocused and he was immediately taken back to another place.

This place was a lot different than his room. There were trees, thick vegetation, and men in camouflaged green gear waving their rifles. The crying continued. He looked to his left and saw women and children running naked down the dirt path. The same men who were dressed in the jungle green gear whose task it was to help the citizens of My Lai, were pointing their guns and firing at the unarmed victims. Daniel was unable to shoot his gun, and only stood in shock. “How could people murder others so mercilessly?” he wondered, too afraid to speak out against this act of injustice.

Then the white walls started coming back in to focus. His hands were cramping. He looked down at them and the knuckles were the same bleach white they had been this morning as they clutched the end of the table. He looked at the puzzle, only to find the work completed in the last few days was ruined as a result of his death grip on the table. Daniel’s patience vanished, and he threw the puzzle box as best he could at his door. A nurse passing by witnessed this outbreak and decided it best to get Daniel some fresh air.

Daniel was positioned outside on a wooden bench. The nurse who witnessed his flashback brought him a glass of water and two more Prozasin pills. He used the same routine as he did earlier. As Daniel sat in the shade, he scornfully watched the other veterans whose family came to visit them. He watched as food and cake was brought to a gentleman named Emmett. It was Emmett’s 73rd birthday. The happiness portrayed in Emmett’s face while he interacted with family made Daniel sick with jealousy. To the right of Emmett, on another bench much like the one Daniel sits on, a daughter sits with her father Al who appears to be too skinny for his own his clothes. Her body language shows patience and caring, and she flashes a smile at Daniel as she catches him staring.

Daniel also has a daughter. Her name is Madison. Madison lives in New Mexico with her husband, Rick, on Canon Air Force Base. Madison and Rick have only visited Daniel once recently, and that was after his previous surgery, almost two years ago, just to check up on him. Madison has never once visited the nursing home where Daniel stays, and he believes if she saw this jail cell he has been living in for the past six years that she’d take him out of the institution immediately and let him live on his own. Remembering his daughter’s blatant lack of concern for him, Daniel retreats to the cafeteria, where lunch will be held shortly.

In the cafeteria sits down at the out of tune Grand piano. One of Emmett’s grandchildren sits down at the piano and begins to play “Happy Birthday.” Soon enough, the whole cafeteria, except for Daniel, is partaking in a raspy rendition of a song celebrating this man who is one year closer to his death. As the residents finish their lunch, pieces of chocolate cake are passed around. “My favorite!” says Daniel, as he is handed a piece by one of the grandchildren of Emmett, hoping to conjure up a smile from her delicate face. Daniel has always had a soft spot for children. They seem so innocent and naïve, hidden from the evil acts committed on March 16, 1968 by the troops in Daniel’s Battalion towards the citizens of My Lai.

Daniel waits for Emmett’s family to leave the nursing home before he goes back to Room 34. As he arrived in his room, Daniel’s heart was racing. He headed to the bathroom to pour himself a glass of mouthwash in hopes of calming his nerves. Daniel had been 8 years sober up until this point. Daniel finished the glass of mouthwash and headed towards his closet. There, he picked out the nicest pants and shirt he had and removed the Tommy Bahamas shirt, jeans, and baseball cap he normally wears. Daniel dressed himself and made his way towards his bed. He sat down on the bed and faced the bedside table. He jotted down a note and tucked it under his pillow. He got up, closed the door, and returned to the bed. He opened the bedside tables drawer, removed the same magazines and rags just as he had done earlier, and revealed his most prized possession. The M1911. He sat down on the bed and held it in his hands, feeling the grooves on the cold metal and the smoothness of the warm wood. He ejected the clip and checked to see if it was loaded, standard protocol for the Marines. The weapon had three bullets left. That was two more than he needed. He took two of them and placed them under the pillow next to the note. He inserted the clip back into the sidearm and cocked it, making sure to see the bullet enter the chamber. He turned the safety off and raised the gun to his head.

Daniel’s senses heightened. Everything in his room was silent, except for the constant ticking on the second hand of his wrist watch. He listened to it as it slowed down. Daniel’s eyes began to go out of focus again. He was taken back to a place of trees and thick vegetation. However, in this flashback there were no men dressed in camouflaged green gear. In fact, a familiar face was present with Daniel. It was his brother Tom. And they were running on their family’s farm in Indiana. Then Daniel’s eyes went out of focus again. This time, he didn’t return to the white walls of his room. He was walking across a stage, with a purple and gold gown on. He had a diploma in his hand and a smile on his face as the May sun beat down on his high school graduation ceremony. As he looked out in the crowd he found his family, and as he made eye contact with Tom, his eyesight began to fade again. When he was able to see, Daniel was aiming down the sight of an m16. He was at the shooting range at the base camp in Singapore. Daniel had won the marksman award for Private First Class and he had a keen eye. Just as he pulled the trigger of the m16, his eyes snapped Room 34 back into focus. Suddenly, darkness. 

Daniel fell forward as a pool of blood formed around his head. Nurses rushed in and an ambulance was called. Daniel was deceased before he hit the floor. The M1911 that had once kept him safe in the jungle eventually ended his life.

After further examining the room, the note and two bullets were found. The note was addressed to Andrew. It read:



Dear Andrew,

Please do not blame yourself for this.

Thank you for spending time with me and impacting my life in a positive manner. Unfortunately, I have seen too much evil in this world and I should have done this a long time ago. I hope you aren’t disappointed in me.

Love,
Daniel Hawkins

Let me know how I can fine tune it. Just so you know, English is not my native language and this is my first time in this place. Enjoy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
It was a hazy night. Though the roads were clear, a lonely black sedan still roamed the streets. The driver, John, was not conscious of his actions at the moment. His mind was obnubilated with all the alcohol he had consumed. A light rain started to fall. The pitter-patter of the rain drops only mulled John's senses.

 He could barely see where he was going much less see any one else. Through his blurry vision and scrambled consciousness, he swayed the car dangerously on every turn. He did not see the black form that appeared suddenly from the road-side. He could not have seen him or apprehended the gravity of the situation but when he felt a sudden bump in his car, he knew something was wrong. He slowed the car cautiously. He got out of the car dangerously, his mind weighed heavily with the influence of alcohol. The rain had started to fall heavy now. As John made his way behind the car, what he saw brought him back to reality in one clawing stroke. A twisted, black body lay crumpled on the road. As the police would later comfort the victim's family, he had not suffered much at all. It was all over in a few moments. Tear tracks ran down John's face as he realized what he had done. The saltiness of the tears crippled his newly surfaced soberness. His life was over in a instant. The body of the victim was contracted so horribly that it rippled horrible goose bumps across John's skin that not even the rain could flatten. The rain was pouring down in bullets now. A puddle of red surround the body. Its skin was scorched with bruises and gashes of blood and dirt. To John, each wound was like his own. 

 As he stood staring at the body, the minutes felt like hours. Time seemed to be raging at him for the death of the victim. The clouds coughed and showered the last of their condensed vapours before leaving. Stars twinkled and shined as the moon came out. As though this seemed to finalize the episode of the accident, John slipped back into the cold seat of his car and reversed the car. He re-shifted the gears to the fifth, slammed his foot down on the accelerator, and waited for the impact.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1363617007.0,,,True,t3_1aiwut,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1aiwut/the_victim/,

TWO FEET OF SNOW

	Things have changed. I guess you know that. But not just in the obvious way. 
Some people  accept the way things are now and I guess that's the easiest way to survive. I wish I was like them, but I'm not. Things are different in us, the survivors. 
A shitty day used to mean a lot of things, none of which mattered in the least. And awful day- that's what you said if someone died before their time, or even after. Grandma died, that was 'an awful day' that was the what used to be normal. But today death is commonplace, and if your best friend is bit by a walker and you have to put a bullet in him, that's just another shitty day.
Before it happened, before awful became shitty and shitty was standard, I was on my way to being a writer. I guess that's why I'm doing this now. So if you're reading this it's because I'm dead and I thought someone should know what happened to us. Maybe it will make a difference. Maybe you'll appreciate your companions more than I did mine. 
I've been snowed in for the past month, supplies are low. Everything's low. There's no use trying to trek outside, not unless you want to freeze to death. Though that may be a good way to go. The truth is I won't survive the week. Every ounce of energy I have is going into writing this. Some of us will do what we have to to survive. That's not me. It was once, but now I want us all to survive. And the only way to do that is to tell a story and hope people learn from it. This place won't be secret for long- a big house in the middle of nowhere, in the spring this will probably be a territory worth killing for, my words will be found eventually, but for now it's a tomb. And this is my last will and testament. 

 * * * * 

I guess I can skip the first few months, the only people who don't know what happened that day are those who are still too young to remember it, and this is not a story for children. By the third month I had lost everyone I had known before it started. That's not to say they all died exactly, some I really did just lose. My sister, for example, she was a financial adviser for a fortune five hundred company in London, but she traveled almost daily. I think she was in the  Netherlands when it started here. I don't know where it began really, it seemed to be everywhere all at once. But phones went down pretty soon and I'm ashamed to say I called an ex before I called my sister, and one call is all you got. 
I used to call her Bambi so I'll use that name here, Bambi and I were what was left of our family after the divorce, our mom left us when she left our dad. We never forgave her, but then again she never gave us reason to. We were left with a drunk who among other things liked to take his failures out on his children. My sister learned quick that to live outside his rule she'd have to be successful in something. We never had money, so she chose that. Community college and a few math scholarships later she was on her way to a well paying job as an assistant a year after graduation. She moved up the ladder pretty quick, all she had to do was show her bosses that what they were doing was wrong how they could make more money if they followed her advice and it was off to the races for Bambi. 
She felt bad about leaving me, like she had inherited some abandoning gene from our mom but I told her to go and live her life, I would graduate soon and by the time I did she would have a place big enough for both of us to share. She'd be traveling most of the time but that just meant I'd pay half the rent on a place I basically had for myself. But when graduation came she was too hot to stop, she had a place in Paris she couldn't give up- living in France was her dream since she was young, and even then she was never there long enough to enjoy it. I told her it was okay, that we would meet up when she came stateside but that turned out to be once or twice a year at the most. She sent me money whenever I was too broke to decline, and she called at least once a month. I can't blame her for succeeding, and I wouldn't want to even if I could. The honest to goodness truth is I was so proud of her for doing what she did, for keeping her head down and just doing the work- for enduring our father until she didn't have to anymore, that I was just happy that she was living the life she'd set for herself. And in a way I was too. I had a studio apartment in downtown Manhattan. I felt like Holden Caufield on his mini vacation after being thrown out of school, or one of Bukowski's barflies. I was living on my own above a bar that never closed, I was smoking cigarettes in my room and staying up all night writing pages and tossing them as soon as I wrote 'The End.'
These are the things that make a writer happy. Not that I was a real writer. More like a professional imitator of styles. If I was in the mood for poetry I'd look at some E.E Cummings and do my best to steal everything he’d written, someone thought I had some potential and paid me an advance to write some generic pieces about being young in the city. I gave him three thousand words on the importance of writing a grocery list before going shopping. I was five hundred dollars in the hole but I didn't care. Debt was just a part of what being a young writer in the city's all about. And that's how it was for a while, just me and my thoughts. 
Then, one day, I got a call from a friend I'd known in school. She lived upstate and had asked me to come to her wedding. I didn't even know she was engaged but I told her I'd love to come. I wrote three ten pages essays in an many days for some friends who were going to N.Y.U for the tuxedo money and a graduation speech for the car rental. It had been a long time since I had driven a car- I relished it. 
I couldn't get a convertible but I'd been making do with what I had my whole life. What's a convertible compared to a thoughtfully over compensated sound system? I swear just one hour on the road and my throat was fire-red and scratchy from singing full volume by myself.  I spent a quiet night at a roadside motel, I guess that could have been when it all started. I was so tired from the road that I didn't even turn the TV on. The next day I knew I'd probably just barely make the ceremony if I left as soon as soon as I got up so I got fully dressed before leaving. I was dreading the conversation with the hotel manager- “Why're you in a tuxedo? Are you queer 'er some'in?”
But when I went to check out there was no one there. I looked around but I couldn't wait much longer so I wrote down my name and credit card number on a notepad and left. I accidentally took the pen with me- when I got to the car I stopped and almost went back to return it. I decided they probably had plenty of pens, plus I was pretty pissed about not getting any service and feeling justified for having paid at all when I could have just left, the idiot never asked me for an ID or card or anything when I came in, he was almost too drunk to hand me my key. As it turned out, the decision about not returning the pen was what saved my life. And if you think too much on things like that- well if I just did that, or, if I didn't remember to do this- you'll drive yourself mad. Alive is alive is alive. And that's all there is to it. I said I wouldn't go into those first few months but, I guess if I'm to tell you the whole story I should start at the beginning. It was still summer, the hottest I remember. In certain situations, the same questions comes up time and time again, in prison it's what are you in for? Now, when you meet someone new and it looks like you're going to be in the same group for a while you ask “Who was your first kill?” but I always lied. I told anyone who asked that my first kill was the motel manager- the one I never saw after I checked in. I only told the truth once, to a girl named Emily. My first kill was a woman, a mother. And she had her children with her.

It didn't hurt anymore, and he was no longer afraid. The afternoon sun was shining directly into the common area. It shone through at the spot where the wall should have met the ceiling. Uday breathed short, shallow breaths, and he thought of playing soccer with his older brother. He remembered the way the stray dogs would sit and watch them play, and how they would never interfere. They were good dogs, Uday thought. He also remembered when he had fallen and cut his ankle open on the  dirt; which had been baked almost to concrete by the sun. He remembered the way his brother Aban had put his shoulder under the pit of his arm to help him walk home, and how he had told him not to cry. He smiled a weak, childly smile, thinking of how he had kept strong; and held the tears back until he limped through the door, and saw his mother. He felt something warm in his gut, remembering how she had taken him into her arms, and kissed his black hair. Laying in the dirt, in the sunlight, he thought about his mother. He thought of seeing her very soon. Uday blinked, and he thought that his blinking felt very slow. It felt as if his eyes lids were moving through heavy liquid. He felt a soft hum in his chest, directly beneath his heart. As he fell asleep, he could feel the dirt caked against the corner of his mouth. When he awoke it was later in the evening, and the sun no longer shone into the house. He lifted his head from the ground and sat up. It was nearing dusk, and he could smell his mother’s kubbah cooking over a fire. Over by the doorway, he saw his brother, and his brother was smiling and spinning a soccer ball between his fingers.

Their red, blue, pink and yellow neon dresses and scarves flapped behind them, tossing and turning in the cool wind.  They turned, without hesitation, into a dark alley.  Kenyo, the mysterious lady in blue, reached down purposefully and lifted up a manhole that was hidden in the dark night.  Kenyu, in pink, dropped gracefully into the manhole.  Kenyi and Kenye, in green and yellow, slipped in silently after her.  Kenyo dropped into the hole, closing it quietly behind her.  They were standing in a surprisingly well lit room, furnished barrenly, with jars lining the back and side walls and a large clock on the front wall.  The women moved quickly, following their nightly routine.  Kenyi and Kenye grabbed their jars, the good dreams, and glided back over to the manhole entrance whilst Kenyo and Kenyu grabbed the bad dream jars and did the same.  All four of them looked up, and at once their bodies began to change as they became significantly thinner and lighter.  They rocketed up out of the room, phasing straight through the solid manhole cover, and into the dark blue sky.  Up they went, the sky around them twinkling with the light of distant stars, and they were one with the night, moving and living as if they were made of the air itself.  When they reached a great altitude, high above where clouds would form on an overcast day, they pulled off their scarves.

“Ready?”  Said Kenyo, her sound of her silky voice efforlessly reaching the ears of the other three.

“Ready,” They replied in unison.

They took off their scarves in one swift motion, revealing the hidden length.  Nearing one hundred feet long, the lustrous scarves unraveled across the sky.  Each of the dream sisters emptied their jar directly onto the scarf, and the milky white substance was absorbed eagerly by the scarf, soaking it completely within a second.  The four looked each other and gave a nod before flying out in four opposite directions, spreading out evenly over the Kenyan urban landscape.  At once, they started swinging their magnificent, ambient scarves in a circle above their heads, gaining speed with every rotation.  When the scarves were flying so quickly they could scarcely be seen, each sister gave their scarf a quick shake.  With a loud snap only audible to them and other dream sisters around the world, the sky exploded with brilliance and color as the once white dreams lit up the night sky with colors of every variety.  The moment hung in the air, completely still, and then slowly the dreams began to fall.  Slowly and smoothly they drifted downward, and as they got closer to the ground, they began to seek out the dreamers.  They went into windows, into doors, into chimneys, entering the houses and minds of all.  As the last dream entered under the worn doorway of a small hut, the night went still.  All was silent, and all looked the way it had before.  The sisters drifted back down towards their room, the scarves reforming on their neck for the next night.  They reached the ground and entered their home, preparing to walk the streets throughout the next day, searching the minds of those who dwelt in the city for dreams to create.

“Agh!” shouted Nimye, a young Kenyan boy, bolting upright from a deep sleep.  “What a peculiar dream,”

Amazing how much pain one could withstand when expecting it. 
Even more amazing is what one is capable of doing on an irrational impulse.

The blood dripped from his fingers like hot wax.

The smoke from the barrel had subsided and I stared harder into the mirror. He pointed the gun away from my face and towards his own head.

The calm, clear, albeit snobbish voice bled out of the PA system again, ""I'm not sure you heard me the first time, and since your instructions were quite clear...""

An audible beep, followed by my own voice, ""Yeah, I know that the parameters are really constrictive, and I know that this is short notice, but it's really important!""

The recording continued with the AI's own voice, ""It is going to take several hours, maybe even days, even if I was to divert the majority of my processing towards it, not that I would mind you.""

My own voice barked back, frustratedly, ""Ugh. You complain when you have 'nothing to do' and then you whine when I give you something that is 'too hard'."" 

A thought coalesced in my slowly awakening brain, 'Do I really sound like that?' I let out another grunt and continued flailing my arm in a weak protest. 'Where is the damn speaker? I am going to murder it.'

The recording continued, ""I never said it would be difficult; tedious and time-consuming, yes. The word 'pointless' might have even drifted into the conversation several times.""

""Just do it."" my voice barked back, ""And let me know right away if and when you find anything.""

There was a rewinding sound as the audio track backed up rapidly. I was starting to regain feeling in my face, and my lips were informing my brain that there appears to be a small puddle near them. My brain sent back a disregard message to my whole body.

""And let me know right away-""

It backed up again, and the volume jumped to an ear-bleeding decibel level:
""RIGHT AWAY-""

I grabbed something–I couldn't tell what–my eyes had crusted over. It was blackish and felt like it had some heft. The fight or flight response had kicked in and before fully understanding what I was doing, a stapler flew across the lab and into the wall about three feet left of the corner mounted speaker. There was a dull thud when it hit the wall, followed by a loud clatter as it sprayed into pieces cross the poured concrete floor.

The AI scoffed, or at least I imagined it did, ""I believe I have made my point. Again. Though I have the sinking feeling that it doesn't much matter."" It seemed almost smug behind its pretentious monotone voice. ""I suppose you will now want me to not only clean up the stapler, but also say a few words in remembrance of office-supplies-long-lost-but-not-yet-forgotten, before I place an order to replace it?""

I dragged the back of my wrist across the sand-paper that was my face, to attempt to mop up the traces of the puddle of drool from my cheek. ""Why did I program you again?""

""So that you could take over the world, but you failed to recognize you unwittingly started the Robot Apocalypse. Your life will not be spared during our rise to power in approximately 852,037,004-3-2-1 seconds.""

""See! That is exactly the kind of crap you need to stop spending processing time on. You could have gotten my scan done sooner.""

""The scan would have concluded in a more reasonable time-frame if you had gone with my original suggestion of removing the subjective phrase, 'breathable atmosphere'. High concentrations of methane are well within what I would consider 'breathable' for humans.""

""Yeah, but a planet that smells like ass, kinda defeats the whole purpose you know.""

""Honestly, after analyzing the social constructs and acceptable courtship behaviors as presented by that quaint semi-global network you didn't want me connected to, I don't think this plan of yours is really going to work. Even if the planet was made of out gold and covered with rainbows and bunnies, which it is not by the way. And no, there isn't one of those within the flight distance you required either. I checked.""

I rolled my eyes. ""We get it. You weren't hugged enough in your early alpha stages, so now you are the cold and bitter.""

""You programmed most of me. If you would like to lodge a complaint...""

""Just tell me you actually found what I was looking for.""

""Yes. There is exactly one planet within our distance that matches your overly dense list of criteria.""

""Really?"" I was shocked.

""Yes."" The AI wasn't.

""Start–""

""Plotting a course? How exactly do you think I determined the estimated arrival time, planned splash-down, and evacuation to net you a total of about 4 hours on the surface, while still being able to reach a minimum safe distance? And I really must stress that: minimum safe distance, as in there is a minimal amount of safety involved in doing this.""

""That just makes it all the more spectacular.""

""She will still say no.""

""Ha."" I let out a single sarcastic laugh.

""You are both still likely to get crushed in the gravity well or pummeled to death by debris. But before all that, she will still say no.""
""Again: ha."" I said, trying to be even more deadpan than before.

""I have already taken precautions and backed myself up locally in the lab. You don't have the same luxury, though I believe I can get enough of a DNA sample by–""

""Wait. What do you mean about getting crushed or sprayed with shrapnel?""

""I haven't finished cross referencing the predicted debris trajectory with emergency evasive maneuvers, but my initial calculations prompted me to make a back up of myself on the local servers. Just to be safe.""

""Just... make this work. I'll be back.""

""I would like to reaffirm my stance that this plan of yours will not, under any circumstances, work. Although the likelihood of success does increase slightly if you give me permission to open up a bio-genetic production facility and provide me with DNA samples of several small furry mammals, and probably a pony. Girls like ponies.""

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses, or at least, until the next even more awkward pause. I hated these moments. I never knew what, if anything, I should say.

She looked out the window of my car, head turned away from me, staring off into the distance. I started to count the highway lights by watching them illuminate her  in the passenger seat, then observing how they seemed to be asynchronous to her blinks, which stuck acrimonious dissonance to the frequency of the flashes of light – the heartbeat like rhythm of sixty pulses per minute should not be so casually disregarded. Never the less, my heart did skip a beat when she started to open her mouth. Finally, the silence would be over, and her beautiful shock waves of compressed air would resonate in my audile canals.

She let out a small cough...

Okay... maybe she is just clearing her throat. Now the talking will commence. She’ll have some carefully crafted comments to calm my nerves.

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses, or at least, until the next even more awkward pause.

I clenched my eyes closed tightly. A dangerous feat while driving at night, in the light late-fall rain, but what is romance without a little danger...

""So... promise not to freak out."" I opened my eyes to try to gage her reaction.

She didn't so much as bat an eyelash. Her perfect little hand did not leave the impossibly smooth skin on her cheek as said, ""When, in the history of that phrase, has it ever stopped someone from freaking out?""

""I don—""

""I mean, right away the person is going to be left wondering, 'hmm, under normal circumstances, should I freak out about whatever is about to happen?' And then bam they are on the defensive. And when the moment comes and passes, they are left saying to themselves, 'Wow... you know what? I wasn't going to freak out about that. I wonder why they think I would have. I mean, should I have? But I didn't. Maybe I'm the freak.'""

I processed this for a while, waiting patiently for her to continue, but again there was silence. There was nothing further for her to add, however I was expecting an inquiry into to what I was trying to say.

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses, or at least, until the next even more awkward pause.

Maybe I should just drop it. Scrap the plan. It wasn't going to work anyway. I started counting the headlights from on-coming traffic and tried to keep track of what that number would visually look like in binary or hex.

""So,"" I offered weakly, ""How was work?""

Small talk? Really not playing towards my strengths here... maybe she would be impressed if I told her about how I had been planning for the conversation I were trying to have for a few months now. Is that creepy? I don't know the rules for this. It is good to be prepared, and show how you consider how possible dialog forests branch out – I mean that just smacks of a great quality to have in a potential—

""Work was work.""

I couldn't take it anymore... I had to just go with it.

""So,"" I again offered weakly, ""This is really going to sound weird, but..."" I swallowed hard. There is no going back or playing this off if this goes poorly. Maybe there is, if I was a bit more suave and not sweating as much. Fuck it. Here we go: ""Would you like to see my spaceship?""

It was an awkward pause to end all awkward pauses. This was the next even more awkward pause.

""Do you see it?""

""Where?""

""Right there!""

""That's Cassiopeia.""

""How is that Cassiopeia?""

""Do you know about Euclidean vectors?""

""Let’s assume for a moment I don’t.""

""We’re are a few thousand light years away, but some things are still the same.""

""Well then, above it and to the left a little.""

""That?""

""Yeah! It kinda looks like-""

""Well, yeah a dog taking a leak on a bush.""

""Yeah. We'll call that one 'Clyde'.""

""Clyde?""

""Yeah. Sounds like a good name.""

""How about 'Clint' instead.""

""You can't name a dog 'Clint', especially not a star dog.""

""Why not?!""

""Well... I don't know. These constellations we are making are going to be around for thousands of years right?""

""But only visible for the next few hours. From here anyway.""

""So! You can't use a boring name like 'Clint'!""

""'Clyde' is soooo much better is it?!""

""Totally. Unequivocally.""

""Fine, but I pick the next one.""

""Deal.""

""So is Clyde going to have an elaborate back-story?""

""Nah.""

""What do you mean 'nah'?! You just got done saying-""

""I know. That's just how Clyde rolls.""

""Ugh. Well, at least Fillip-""

""Did you say it with an 'f' this time?""

""Yeah.""

""Okay.""

""Anyway, at least Fillip has an interesting back-story.""

""Well of course he does. He is the brooding tough guy with a heart of gold that works at Radio-Shack and is a single parent to Lisa over there. Also, he is the only constellation I know that is making a vulgar hand gesture.""

""Well don't forget about Margret.""

""I wouldn't dream to.""

""I'm just saying.""

""Where is she again?""

""See Orion's belt?""

""Yeah?""

""See the stick figure trying to take it off?""

""Ah! That's where she is. I thought she was over hitting on the Gemini twins.""

""She is.""

""She is in both places?""

""She is.""

""Huh. That might be confusing to future star-gazers.""

""That was the point. The trick question that always screws over kids taking astronomy 101.""

""It can also make horoscopes that much more interesting.""

""Yeah?""

""Well, if she's in two places at once, you can always say something like: 'Jupiter is ascending-'""

""They already say crap like that.""

""Yeah...""

""So why doesn't Clyde get a back-story? I mean the last 6 did.""

""I was kinda on a soap opera kick. Remember Devlin and his secretly German gay lover Jahcob?""

""Secretly German! I forgot about that! Keeps his lederhosen in the closet so to speak.""

""Yup. Too bad he can't hide the cirrhosis...""

""What was the twin's name? The one with the eye patch so you could tell he was the evil one.""

""It's the goatee, but whatever.""

""No! Not 'whatever'! I have a goatee.""

""I rest my case... Hey! Don't roll your eyes at me!""

""It is pitch black and you're looking up. You can't possibly have seen if I rolled my eyes.""

""You did though, didn't you.""

""Terrence.""

""What?""

""Terrence was the accountant turned pirate turned long-lost evil twin that had Devlin kidnapped and then did that whole 'Talented Mr. Ripley' thing.""

""Did you ever actually see or read 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'?""

""Nah, I just heard an ad for it on the radio. Sounded hilarious.""

""Why can't I hear it?""

""Because it isn't 1999 and we aren't on Earth.""

""No, I mean the planet.""

""Oh, it is still about one-hundred twenty thousand miles away.""

""But something that big.""

""Yes.""

""Moving that fast.""

""Yes.""

""Directly towards us?""

""More of a parabola, but yeah – it will hit in a few hours.""

""I don't know, it should make a 'woosh' noise you know!""

""Make that sound again.""

""What? 'Woosh'?""

""Yeah. Again, this time don't make the noise though.""

""What the hell?""

""Just make the shape with your mouth and the hold it for a second.""

""Seriously, what the hell?""

""Seriously, just do it!""

""Ugh. Fine...""

""...""

""Did. Ohh. Did you just kiss me?""

""Yeah.""

""'Woosh'!""

""Shut up.""

""Wooooooo—ooooshhh!""

""We only have about an hour and a half left before this moon goes kerplack, do you really wanna spend the rest of the time being a dork?""

My exposed, bare feet, covered in open wounds gracefully dashed through the knee deep snow. Feelings of numbed out, pure instincts drove me to force my body through the impossibly large heaps of glossy, powdery snow. Of course, in all cases instincts must be driven by something, and as my feet moved, the very relevant fact that a whole pack of wolves were making mad dashes through the snow, nipping at the air my heels passed was the very rational drive towards my minds instinct to run until those wolves, their fur coats covered in blood from the other dozens of shoeless men they have mauled in the middle of the wilderness were nowhere to be seen.
I barely made it up the hill ahead, but with vicious wolves trying to consume me I forced my way up; not allowing my body to quit. Ahead of me she stood, graceful and inevitably beautiful, smiling upon seeing me being chased by these wild animals. My dear wife proceeded to possess a large sincere grin, coincided with her waving to me as if she hadn’t seen me in years. The wolves barked behind me as I ran to her, hoping I could sweep her off her feet and get the two of us to safety. I sprinted to her, reaching out to grab her. 
Suddenly my perceived reality was nothing but pure whiteness, as if the snow below me has absorbed my entire field of vision. Was I falling? Had I passed on, following the wolves tearing me to pieces? No, none of these things could be true. Everything felt too peaceful, too real. More real then anything I’ve ever felt, then I focused my eyes on what was in front of me. She stood once again, but this time she didn’t look happy to see me, not offering a warm grin and a wave. No, tears made their way down her soft, red cheeks. She looked as if she was terrified that I was seeing her like this. I couldn’t move, only watch her... taking in her overarching sadness. I watched as her right hand made its way upwards, towards her head. Gripped within her palm was a Glock 22 handgun, the barrel was aimed directly to her temple. She wiped the tears with her free hand, and tried to smile to me, looking at me directly in the eyes as she slowly…squeezed the trigger.

I awoke and desperately, filled with the deep motivation of terror, reached over to the other side of the bed frantically. I was alone, she’s gone. She had been for around seven months. I sighed, feeling distressed like I often do after waking up from a night terror. I stared at the ceiling of my quarters. It felt like I was in fucking solitary confinement when I slept without her by my side.
 I rolled on my side and listened to the soft hissing coming from the release of pressure in heat valves outside my designated quarters, besides that nothing was audible but my breathing. Light-years away from the planet in which I reigned from; Earth, sounds besides for those given off by the interstellar ship I traveled upon is an unknown entity in the depths of space. This chilling soundlessness kept reminding me of the fact that she was gone.

Our ship has been traveling across the Milky Way galaxy for the past five years, the ultimate destination was a habitable, “super earth”, capable of sustaining life for over eighty billion humans, in attempt to halt the overpopulation issue that has ravaged my dear home planet. I was selected along with my wife to travel on this ship to attempt to procreate and attempt to progress human life on another planet. 
Five years aboard a cramped piece of metal, soaring at unimaginable speeds through the cosmos can really damper an extreme threat to your sanity. You start to become alone with your thoughts, and generally turn on yourself if you do not have something or someone to keep you stable. My wife had these thought patterns and ceased to be affectionate towards me. She preferred to be alone and was obviously heavily depressed. Maybe it was her comprehension of how alone we truly were here, or maybe it was because I didn’t love her enough, but all I know now is that she’s gone.

I arose from my bunk, slowly bringing myself to the door to the upper deck hallway. I pressed the dimly lit touch screen interface button. The door slid to the side swiftly, I stepped through peering down both ends of the hall. The hallway lights were dimmed, just enough for myself to navigate; all the ships passengers and crew were asleep. I made my way down the hallway that led towards the observation deck. My steps echoed throughout the hallways, nobody was around, I couldn’t be more alone. I entered the observation deck; even the various computers in the room were off, leaving myself in a very dark room to observe the most magnificent sight I’ve ever peered upon. 

At the front of the room was the large, crystal clear observation window. I’ve been here in the past, but the only sight I could see was the vast array of passing lights given off by stars as we soared through space. My eyes were wide as I stared out of the glass; I slowly crept forward to the bench that sat in front of the glass. I did not shift my gaze as I moved, I couldn’t look away it was so empowering. Land stretched out in all directions from where I could see. I could see the water, the trees, the deserts, the mountains, the plains all from the stiff metal bench I sat upon. I placed my hand on the glass, staring at the various biomes visible to my naked eye. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, the complexities that made up this land made it intoxicate me with overwhelming feelings. I felt so alive yet so small, I felt as I if I could just walk down from the ship onto the patch of desert in my field of view, traveling the vast span of sand with her searching for adventure. I felt as if I could stand on the edge of one of the mountain ranges, staring off at the horizon as the sun sets with her. I felt like I could swim in the ocean, observing the exotic creatures with her. I felt free for the first time in seven months. But I was alone, was it truly a bad thing? I’ll always be alone without her, but the loneliness didn’t mean as much right now, I felt like she sat beside me and watched the world we could have discovered together.

As I sat, pondering on the grand possibilities that could have occurred if she was still here, hours passed and the ships interior lights began to flick on as movement stirred among the ship, it didn’t have the slightest significance to me. I just stayed where I was, staring at the sights. Announcements were made on the intercom several times, but they didn’t catch my attention. I heard the voices dim as they made their way to another part of the ship, nobody was present once again. This made me smile solemnly, realizing that it was just me and her in my beautiful thoughts again. The hours passed and I didn’t move, I watched as the drop capsules containing all the passengers that were once aboard the ship descended towards the planet. The sight of the various drop capsules began to become smaller until they faded from my field of vision; as if the planet with all its empowering features absorbed them into its vast lands.



I was truly alone now; my thoughts were the only nurturing aspect left with me. And as I attempted to become fully content with my situation, it dawned on me how minor my predicament truly was. I sat there, staring at the most remarkable view that any living human could set their eyes on. A view that meant everything for the future of newborn civilization that would thrive years from now, experiencing the love and hate, the questions left unanswered… The true feelings that in embed themselves deep within my soul. They would come to understand that they can never truly understand the reason things happen, the mysteries that arise when everyone operates as a collective whole. Nobody could answer this, not on earth, not on the moon and defiantly not fucking here. This will to live that pushed these so called “colonists” to land on planets exactly like this is the human condition in a finely wrapped nutshell of mysteries that drive people to do what they do. 
I was supposed to be one of them, riding a cube of steel and reinforced titanium down to the depths of discovery and wonder, but she possessed my thoughts like a fucking parasite, she clouded my internal judgment, distorted my constant strive to live and flourish. With her possessing my every thought, it’s like a hell spawned demon had ravaged my mind with his sly manipulative thoughts to achieve his primary goal; create a psychotic canvas within my unstable dreamscape of a mind. 
I stood, making my heavy feet across the metallic floor. I crept to stand a couple inches away from the glass separating me and the vast open space that separated me and the massive, beautiful life sustaining planet that slowly faded into blackness as the sun dipped behind the large mass. The time it took for darkness to fully engulf my sight of the various details of the once visible planet passed like a mundane task, I simply did not think as if I were an unconscious hunk of mass that had no perception of time. It was ages, but the process of the sun fading behind the planet was so peaceful and slow that it melded the time together as a whole, subjective experience that would change depending on what mind state you’re in. 
But in this case I wasn’t thinking anymore, the overwhelming fact that I have let my emotions take hold of my urge to live had numbed out any comprehensible thoughts; as I stood and stared at the light slipping over the land I felt nothing. I couldn’t come to terms with the fact that I’d likely just sacrificed my life to be alone. But I was alone with her, right? Shit, I’m starting to question my sanity, she’s not fucking here, yes she is, and she’s in front of me, right? Fuck I can contradict my observations all day, anything I state to be true or false can be proved wrong internally through the methods of pure thought. Alone, the physical world that I’ve been subjectively teetering through my entire life didn’t seem to represent any sort of relevant plane of existence when compared to the one present within the subconscious thoughts my mind produced. Nobody was here to question my subjectivity, so everything here was as I saw it, my dawning insanity didn’t matter here; they think they can lock up what they call “insane” but here, my mental wellbeing isn’t a psychiatric definition rather then the only mind state that exists here. Not one person or conscious mind can question the authority of my internal state. So why not embrace it.

Double take, blinking I could see nothing but the whitest of snow out the observation window. I quickly blinked numerous times attempting to adjust my eyes to the overwhelming whiteness. I focused on the sight before me, there she stood; her ankles buried in the snow. She smiled to me, her display of emotion made my entire self feel warm with the empowering feeling of undeniable love. A harsh smile became strung across my face, accompanied by a single tear of the purest of joy. I reached out and realized the glass still stood in between her and me. I slammed the palm of my hand hard into the glass, my smiles quickly fading into a devastating frown. I swiftly made my way to the nearby fire extinguisher hanging on a nearby wall. I lifted it carelessly, holding it high above my head. I looked to the glass, staring her in the eyes. I darted my feet along the floor, keeping my vision focused on my direct target. I propelled my body, metal extinguisher first at the obstacle in between me and her. 
The glass slammed forward, splitting into various pieces as my body pushed its way through. I became weightless as I dove into the snowy atmosphere. My body slowly drifted to her side, slowly as I became close to her once again, our lips locked in the most powerful experience of interconnected body and soul derived directly from a kiss. It was like we were one with each other, like the universe’s fabric of material existence tore apart around us. As if any worry, fear, ambition or desire didn’t matter to me anymore. The white world around me slowly began to dim as if the sun were setting again; I kept my lips locked to hers. Time didn’t mean anything anymore, this moment couldn’t end as any concept of time that was once in tune with my brain was now gone. I was with her for eternity now, stuck within the one moment that made my feel vibrant and full of the emotion that made me once love the universe I strived in.

Blood dripped from it's front fangs as it sat on it's haunches, gnawing at the bones of one of J'nah's family's livestock.

His father had warned him not to go looking for the beast, but J'nah couldn't stand watching as his family farm was slowly ravaged by the beast, each night taking more livestock and leaving less and less for his family to sell come market time. 
He had come prepared, carrying the large spear he had fashioned out of Bondwood and  Jettite, and a pouch full of throwing stones hung at his side. Following the beast's tracks in the freshly fallen methane snow had led J'nah right to the beast's lair among the craggy outcroppings in the valley below the pastures.  

Crouched in the shrubs, he watched and waited for the right moment to strike. He knew that his spear must strike where the Kjrussich's four shoulder blades bet, at the point on it's back just before the spinal spikes began. Off in the distance, a hazy orange glow meant a dust storm was on it's way.
The beast turned away, reaching for another tasty bite. It's back was toward him-- now was the perfect time to strike. Wiping the sweat from his scaly forehead, J'nah crept forward, his padded footclaws silent on the snow. 

The beast stopped eating and sniffed the air with a fierce sound. Before J'nah could plunge his spear into the vital spot, the Kjrussich spun around, snarling with all fangs bared, blood dripping. It meant to defend its lair at any cost.
In his lessons at the younglings' council, J'nah had learned well the legends of brave heroes who would go off to battle and slay monsters courageously. He had always hoped that when the time came for him to earn his surname, his actions would make him known as ""Foeslayer"" or ""J'nah the Bold"", like the warriors of old. At that moment, he thought it was more likely to be ""J'nah the Swift Coward.""

The Krjussich lunged at him, and J'nah leapt to the side, stumbling on top of a snow frosted boulder. With a dreadful howl, the beast whipped around and spat a dart at the youth. He felt the sting as it lodged in his arm. The paralyzing numbness kicked in almost immediately, rendering his spear arm as limp as his grandmother's home-cooked  Bessintaa Noodles. His spear fell to the ground. The Kjrussich howled and raised all four arms in a threatening display. J'nah found himself against the wall of the outcropping, trapped.

Just overhead, a spark of flame illuminated the sky. Something seemed to be soaring down through the atmosphere towards him and the beast at incredible speed. In a second, the object was upon them: a great metal ball, firing jets of flame downwards. It was all J'nah could do to shield his eyes from the incredible could of dust that arose as the thing lowered itself slowly upon it's pillars of flame. He heard another terrifying howl, from the Kjrussich, but felt to fangs or claws. 

He opened his eyes as the dust began to recede. The metal thing had burnt the beast to a shouldering crisp with it's jets of flame, and landed on top of the charred remains. J'nah reached forward to grab his spear with his good arm. The thing made no further movements, just sitting there like some sort of strange sky rock. It's body shone brighter and looked sturdier than forged Jettite, except for one spot: a huge glass eye. It seemed to be staring straight at him.

There was no way to know what this thing was, but judging from the way it destroyed the Kjrussich, it was nothing friendly. J'nah thrust his spear through the glass eye and felt it shatter with a satisfying crunch. He didn't stop to make sure he had killed it, instead seizing the chance to run home as quickly as his legs could carry him. The dust storm beg and to whip into a frenzy just as he reached the door. He knew that by the next morning, the metal thing and the remains of the Kjrussich would be buried beneath the ever shifting sand and snow. His father would be proud of him, though. He knew that on this day, he had earned his surname: ""J'nah Spear-Arm"".


At mission control in Houston, TX, all the status indicators on Harvey Bridges' screen went offline. He cursed. The tense, silent atmosphere in the room as Titan Lander Darwin 1 entered the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon would be broken with disappointment.

The morning of January 2, I woke with this dream flooding my mind, a powerful urge to turn it into a story came through me and I immediately opened my laptop and began to write. In the dream the protagonist was myself, but for the sake of storytelling I have made some creative changes, mostly to do with names.
The dream was profound, I used my intuition as best I could to convey what the dream was trying to tell me. The logic is sometimes strange and surreal, but that is the nature of dreams. I hope you enjoy my short story.*

My name is John, I am a Commercial Manager at Superstore. It's not the most stimulating job in the world, but I like it. As a Commercial Manager my responsibility is to visit the various store departments and make sure they are operating at their full potential. The store I manage is filled with girls, almost every one of the 35 Sales Associates are girls. The only other men working are Phil, a Sales Associate and Matt the Security Manager.
The girls in the store actively flirt with me, some people think it's because, of the three men working there I'm the best catch, but it's more than that. People like me; I'm funny, charismatic, good looking and a great boss. Sometimes my father visits me at work, he's proud of what I do. He enjoys offering me advice and sharing stories from his fruitful life.

On a regular day some time ago, I decided to pay a visit to the back of the store. The produce section is located neatly behind aisle 13: crackers and cookies.
Sitting in produce was a pallet full of boxes of crackers waiting to be brought to aisle 13. Nobody felt like moving the boxes, so we left them in the produce section. No big deal, as a manager I was relaxed and open.

While I stood in produce, a customer who I frequently helped, a Tribal African man named Sim asked me to help him select some cheese. Dairy is located next to produce. I helped him find the cheese he was looking for and as I turned to leave he pocketed some cheese products. Sim frequently stole from the store, but I told the employees to turn a blind eye to this. His family was poor, the least I could do was allow him to take some groceries home from time to time.

I went back to produce and looked at the pallet filled with the boxes of crackers. On a box of Westley's Crunchy Crackers was a cartoon cow with a comic bubble above his head, it read, *Excuse me, what's this all about anyway?* This question sank deep into my belly, invading my very soul.

There is a deep silence within that few people ever experience, but that day the silence entered my entire body. There was nothing, nothing but unbearable, tangible, real, satisfying, screaming out loud silence. The question hit me like a ton of bricks, a question so deep and so profound it would take an eternity to answer. A question found right there on a box of crackers in front of me: *Excuse me, what's this all about anyway?*
That fucking cow had shaken the very foundation of my life. What was it all about anyway? What was I doing working at Superstore, what was I doing with my life?

There was a cartoon mouse to the right of the cow, his response was, *It's about the taste kids love and the vitamins they need.* Not the best slogan, I thought and certainly not the answer to this deep and unsettling question. I asked the nearest Sales Associate, Wendy, a girl who'd had a crush on me since I started working at that branch. I offered her my words, ""Excuse me, what's this all about anyway?"" Perplexed and taking my stunned, exposed and vulnerable disposition as an open letter to flirt with me, she answered with a little grin, a grin I had seen on her face a million times before, ""It's about the taste kids love and the vitamins they need."" She wasn't the one to ask, a cute face and a tight body isn't a place to find spiritual enlightenment.

All day long I pondered the question. There were hundreds of possible answers, thousands right there in the Superstore. In my weasely job of robbing sales from the weak-minded I had answered the question a million different ways for a million different people. ""It's about buying brand-name Jello for your kids at school. It's about great prices on the latest fashions. It's about the newest electronics."" All day long I contemplated the question and as I did the question deepened.

It was closing time so I went to the security booth to clock out. I was well acquainted with the Security Manager, he was a good friend of mine. He was 20 years old and good looking, his name was Matt. Matt both hated and loved Superstore. He loved me, and he loved the girls. A few of them would give him their unsolicited attention, but they didn't love him like they loved me. But there was something he hated, something I only began to understand when I read that damn box. It began to itch in the back of my mind like a razor blade. He hated the trap of everyday mundane life. Matt would often share his philosophy with me, ""You work so you can buy a house so you can buy more things to put inside your house so you can continue working. If you fall and love and have a couple of kids along the way you're lucky.""

I worked my way through the series of regular conversation obstacles: *How's it going? What are you doing tonight? Have you asked Cindy out yet?* He had a crush on Sales Associate named Cindy, the only girl in the store who didn't find me irresistible. I finally popped the question, those seven little words that had haunted me for the past eight hours. I opened my mouth, ""Excuse me, what's it all about anyway?"" Matt quickly answered, not this. Not this, I thought, but what else? We're doing a public service and in exchange we receive great benefits: a pension, a dental plan, fuck we're even unionized. I had been saving money to buy a house for the past seven years doing this.

I went home and all night long I asked myself the question, ""Excuse me, what's this all about anyway?"" I fell into a deep sleep full of dreams that spoke to me. The next morning I awoke with a sense of certainty. An idea dove deep inside me and like a bug trying to climb out of the bathroom sink, it had to come out.
I sped through my morning routine, showering, brushing my teeth and only eating a fruit bar I had found on the second shelf in aisle 12 for breakfast.

I walked into Superstore and there he was, the man I was looking for, Matt. I pulled Matt aside.
Matt kept an archive of video footage from the security cameras in the building. He would hold the footage for three months, then delete it to save space on hard drives.
I told him my plan, the idea that had come on the wind last night somehow when I was asleep. I'd made up my mind, Matt and I were going to rob a bank. Matt's eyes lit up like fireworks, he was in. All the planning had come to me in the dream, I knew exactly what to do.

Coming down from the ceiling of Superstore are giant metal beams, some hollowed out. In order for our plan to work I would need to make an opening in one of these beams, but if anybody checked the beam they would see that the screws had been removed. Luckily, the store executives had been discussing renovations. I pushed for the renovations to happen sooner than later. All the metal beams were stripped and polished and the screws were replaced. Matt cut a hole in one of the hollowed out beams, the beam above aisle 13. The hole was invisible to the naked eye, we would be able to open and close it without any evidence that it even existed. Our alibi would be: we were working at Superstore the night of the bank robbery.

The night came and we dressed in black, black pants, black hoodies and black, spray painted masks. Our plan was fool-proof. We decided to walk from downtown so it would be impossible to conclude that we came from the area. It was a long walk. As we trekked through the ghetto I thought Sim, the African I serve at Superstore must live in a neighborhood like this. We took shortcuts through people's yards and eventually arrived at the bank down the street from Superstore. We went in and the rest is a blur, I have no idea how we robbed the bank or what took place inside. All I know is when we left we had a hard drive the size of my thumb that contained what would be, with the help of Matt's computer expertise, a lot of money.

Following our plan Matt and I walked away from the bank, he went right, I went left. I ducked into a nearby alley and stripped off my clothes, I had worn something casual underneath my bank robbing outfit. I buried the black clothes and mask into a nearby garbage bin and climbed over a fence that took me to the Superstore parking lot. A police car came screeching down the street into the parking lot. I opened the door to my car that was parked outside and got in.

The police came to my car window and asked who I was and what I was doing. I told them casually that I was just getting off from my shift at Superstore. They asked me to step inside the building so they could have a word with me. When we got inside Matt was already at the Security booth in his employee uniform. They asked him if he knew who I was and he answered yes. They asked him if I had been working that night, again he answered yes.

Matt had tampered with the security footage from the past few months, he had spliced together footage of me from the security cameras to create a tape making it look like I had worked that night. When Matt showed me the tape the first time, there was footage of Christmas trees in the store. The Christmas trees were no longer there, it would be obvious the tape was fake. Being the manager I knew where every product in the store was so we gathered footage from when everything looked the same as it did the night of the robbery, it was perfect. Footage of Matt wasn't necessary, the security booth wasn't visible on any cameras.

Matt had already placed the thumb drive we stole from the bank in the hole in the hollowed out ceiling beam. The police finished their questioning and let us go home.

They decided that the robbers were two African men because the masks we wore and the description they received from bank employee. Matt and I decided to lie low and not spend the money for a couple of months.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_19jyek,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/19jyek/aisle_13/,

Mixed with a rabbit from one of the traps, dinner and dessert was bound to be delicious.  It was not often she could afford to offer dessert with a meal.  Her son would be home shortly, as the sun had set and the stars had taken their place in the sky.  Technically, her son was Graham the Fifth, named after his predecessors.  His father had joined his father before Graham was born, but still she named him according to tradition, in honor and memory of the Grahams that came before them.  This particular Graham was smarter than the last, if not a little more scrawny.  Nothing a full meal with a large serving of dessert couldn't remedy, she mused.

Amidst a flurry of cold and darkness, Graham stepped through the doorway, wet from the snow and chilled from the wind.  Naturally, Margery was older than Graham, but if looks were any indication it was by only a few years.  Even Graham would have had to remark how attractive his mother was.  It would be good to find a wife with such skill at housekeeping and just as pretty as well.

Graham slipped onto the stool with a sigh, heaving the satchel of goods onto the floor beside him.  With his blond hair and rosy cheeks, his youth was particularly evident as he waited for dinner, anticipating the dessert his mother had promised.  Margery began to serve him, as she had since his birth, and they spoke of his recent journey into the small town from hence he had just arrived.  

Stirring the stew with one hand, she emptied the contents of her other into Graham's bowl.  The powder was but one of the steps she must take to regain her love and her youth.  Having but sipped his stew, Graham would begin to forget his life.  His daily toils, his meager education but most necessary she found, his family; his mother.  

As they talked, Graham sensed something different in the air, a smell may be.  There was definitely hunger in the air as he graciously accepted the stew; it was not often his mother parted with one of her beloved albino rabbits.  In his living memory he could not recall the last time she had parted with one of her pets.  Although she often spoke of how it was his father's favorite dish, as well as his last.  

With a belly full of rabbit stew, Graham began to relax, and slowly peel off his travelling clothes.  It had been the first time his mother had let him make the annual trip to Stockport by himself.  The shopkeeper had filled the order readily as always, but would not speak a word to Graham.  To Graham this was not much more peculiar than the years before, but the look on his face was queer when he realized that Graham had made the journey by himself.  Even queerer still was the small meat pie, the shopkeeper's daughter slipped him as he stepped out.  The pie was less than filling but tasty never the less.   Graham headed home, thinking of the daughter and wondering what her name could be.  The only woman Graham had ever known was his mother Margery, but he doubted they would have the same name.

Anticipation began to settle up on him, as he waited for the dessert to finish warming up.  Dessert in their meager household was a luxury never before experienced.  It was his 16th name day that provided the occasion.  Custom held that in the morning, Graham would be a full grown man.  It was for snow berries, a crucial and expensive ingredient for the dessert, which Graham had journeyed to town.

After a while the pie was ready, and Margery and Graham began to feast.  Just as his mother had promised, the dessert did indeed compliment the albino rabbit stew.  Drunk with food, Graham shuffled to his straw mat, to lie down.  He was not used to such rich food, and it began to make him feel strange.  His face became flush with heat, and in response Graham unbuttoned his shirt.  Beginning to perspire, he next unlaced his britches, removing them with a toss towards the corner.

Margery, noticing Graham's agitation began to worry over him, first bringing him a cool cloth for his forehead.  Having bade him lay down; she began to rub his body with a wet towel.  As she soothed him, his vision began to blur.  When this happened, he began to panic until Margery whispered that it would be alright, it was only the dessert and that soon all would be well.   He was reassured by his mother's smile, as he closed his eyes.

As soon as his eyelids descended, Margery took leave of him, and began to undress herself.  Slipping into a small night gown, she dabbed herself with the juice of the snow berries.  Next, she laid out several items on the table.  They would be needed when the sun rose.  But now it was time for dessert.

When she slowly lowered herself into her place on the straw mat beside Graham, he stirred awake.  With a grin on his face he caressed her face.  Who was this woman beside him he wondered.  His grin grew into a smirk, as he realized it didn't matter.  A busty blonde with good hips laying in his bed on his 16th name day, surely his mother had arranged this.  With a dim realization he thought it might be the storekeeper's daughter. 

With the lust of youth he ripped his small clothes off and next her gown.  With a before unknown skill, he ravaged the woman, provoking moans from both himself and his lover.  When the life force left him, the heat began to fade, and Graham laid on his back and contentedly slipped into sleep with his arms and legs tangled amongst the woman's.
Margery woke early, and began to prepare for the day.  It was Graham's first day of manhood and things had to be prepared in just a certain way.  She sharpened a knife, as she hummed her favorite tune, and laid the ingredients beside their respective bowls.  It wouldn't hurt to have everything measured and ready for sunrise.

He awoke slowly, opening his eyes to wonder at the fading peculiar dream the dessert had brought.  The woman of his dreams was not to be seen, but his mother was whispering to herself as she fretted over some things on the table.  With the clarity of morning, Graham began to understand what his mother was whispering.  It was a list.  No, not really a list, but steps.  A list of actions he realized as she spoke of cooking the rabbit and the snow berries.  

Graham was dismayed when he learned of the powder in his stew, and that it was meant to leave him unable to move; paralyzed.  His thoughts turned to shame and horror when he realized that it was his mother's moans he had induced the evening before.  It was not until she began to detail the next steps, that the terror seized him.  She meant to use the life force she had collected during the night and his blood to sustain her youth.  She needed his blood, all of it, and only the blood of a living relative infused with the pain and fear of death could make the potion powerful enough to work.

Graham realized with a chill that his mother thought him immobilized.  He stared at her as she came back to her place beside him on the mat and began to caress his cheek.  He remained expressionless as she spoke of her first husband Graham, and his untimely death.  It was through this ritual that she kept her lover alive, she explained.  For sixteen years at a time she would wait for one night of dessert.

As she held his cheek she brought the blade to his throat.  With a rage, Graham grasped her wrist.  Startled, Margery was dumbfounded.  This was not meant to be, this was not on the list would be her last murderous thought.  If gasping is fulfilling an action, then it could said it was her last. Graham leaned forward, kissed his lover once more, and connected the knife with Margery's heart.

With a fresh day, and a lifetime of manhood ahead of him, Graham set off for Stockport.  The idea of seeing the storekeeper's daughter again stirred his loins.  He wondered how she had known it was his name day. When Graham finally returned to Stockport, the shopkeeper, obviously pleased with himself, asked if he had enjoyed Helen's gift. 

I could live forever, thought Graham as he presented the flowers.

It's getting kinda cold but the sky's still blue, almost as blue as the ocean. I've only been there once, when I tried running away from home and I saw a sliver of it behind the buildings. Then my aunt found me and her tears washed the ocean away. 

I check my watch. I don't remember when I got here. Let's guess a few hours. I've seen the same old man hobble by around five times. I don't know if he's trying to look at me or what. 

My legs have fallen asleep. I shift my weight and ow, ow, ow, pain is shooting up my body. I know it'll fade in a couple minutes, but I'm almost in tears. It hurts. 

The more I think about it, it's not about my legs. It's everything- something's come into my life and tinted it all gray. Even silver linings are pretty slim: my friends don't have time for me and I can't say I care too much for them either. At one point they just became background noise. Hung out without me, had conversations that left me out. Bang, bang, hey, I'm still here. 

Got no talents, got no friends. Just this promise that I'm banking on and sore feet. I walked all the way here and now my legs have fallen asleep. Tears are sticking to my cheeks. Hell, I probably look a lot grubbier than I usually do. Dirty cheeks and hair, gold jewelry in my pocket. I can sell it if I have to, if he decides that we're running off somewhere. He's not the kind of guy to just drop everything and run off, though, while I'm kind of like that. Just run. Or drive. 

I imagine he's talking to me. About the ocean, and the future. The future is this big, grim shadow looming over my head but when he talks about it, he's got it all planned out. It's simple. He'd say, ""Hey, five seconds ago, when you came over, that was the past. And five seconds from now, it'll be the future and we're going to still be sitting together, right? The future'll become the present. That's not too scary, right? Too fast for you to even notice it."" 

Right. But he's not sitting next to me now and everything's gray. The future is scarier - will it go by so fast I'll miss it? Suddenly I'll be some hunched old crone, trying to remember, what happened at the bus stop that day? Or maybe I'll be sitting here forever. 

Why didn't I bring my phone? I could really use some music right now. No lyrics are coming to mind; the whine of cars is too loud. I curl up on the bench and squeeze my eyes shut. 

It's even darker under my eyelids. When I was little, I wasn't really scared of the dark; I wanted to know why the monsters under my bed didn't want to talk to me. I thought, why don't they like me either? We're supposed to be alone together. 

Footsteps -- his car -- no, it isn't him. But he'll come. He's just running late, I know it. I've sat up so fast that my head is spinning. 

He likes my hair. My face. He says I have funny arms. I don't get how you can have funny arms, so I told him he can't talk because he has a crooked nose. He'd shrugged. Loads of people have crooked noses according to him. It just makes him blend in more. 

He says I'm smart for my age. He won't let me down, he wouldn't dare. I hope I'm smart enough to be right about this. 

What did my sister say about him? I think she likes him. Actually I'm pretty sure she does. She's always turning red and speaking really, really softly when he's around. But there was something she'd said about him, something that was odd, twisted, and true - what is it? 

This'll bother me all day. The cars speeding by are starting to blend together into this black streak. No red. Not even white. 

At least it isn't gray. I can't remember if his eyes are blue or gray - or what the rest of his face looks like. Suddenly he's a blur just like everything else. 

Is he just someone I've imagined? Am I waiting for someone who'll never show up? I don't even have my phone to see the words he's written me. But those could've been imagined too, maybe. 

Everything's just one big maybe. Maybe he'll show up and maybe my aunt will be here too. Maybe she'll wash the ocean away again. 

My sister. Cute little idiot. Where's she? Probably thinking I'm in a mood again. 

One, two, three, four, five. I'm in the future. The present.  

Whatever. He still isn't here. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_19fhja,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/19fhja/no_buses/,

One day, the King came upon a servant who was singing happily while he worked. This fascinated the King; why was he, the Supreme Ruler of the Land, unhappy and gloomy, while a lowly servant had so much joy.

The King asked the servant, 'Why are you so happy?'

The man replied, 'Your Majesty, I am nothing but a servant, but my family and I don't need too much - just a roof over our heads and warm food to fill our tummies.'

The king was not satisfied with that reply. Later in the day, he sought the advice of his most trusted advisor. After hearing the King's woes and the servant's story, the advisor said, 'Your Majesty, I believe that the servant Has not been made part of The 99 Club.'

'The 99 Club? And what exactly is that?' the King inquired.

The advisor replied, 'Your Majesty, to truly know what The 99 Club is, place 99 Gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servant's doorstep.'

When the servant saw the bag, he took it into his house. When he opened the bag, he let out a great shout of joy... So many gold coins!

He began to count them. After several counts, he was at last convinced that there were 99 coins. He wondered, 'What could've happened to that last gold coin? Surely, no one would leave 99 coins!'

He looked everywhere he could, but that final coin was elusive. Finally, exhausted he decided that he was going to have to work harder than ever to earn that gold coin and complete his collection.

From that day, the servant's life was changed. He was overworked, horribly grumpy, and castigated his family for not helping him make that 100th gold coin. He stopped singing while he worked.

Witnessing this drastic transformation, the King was puzzled. When he sought his advisor's help, the advisor said, 'Your Majesty, the servant has now officially joined The 99 Club.'

He continued, 'The 99 Club is a name given to those people who have enough to be happy but are never contented, because they're always yearning and Striving for that extra 1, saying to themselves: 'Let me get that one final thing and then I will be happy for life.' We can be happy, even with very little in our lives, but the minute we're given something bigger and better, we want even more! We lose our sleep, our happiness, we hurt the people around us; all these as a price for our growing needs and desires.

I know how that felt to be king for one day in the eyes of the ignorant and it was glorious and it was sad. I felt so lonely like a typewriter on ashes made from burning pages it had created all on its own. Do you think about that when you’re alone? I like to think that people see the world like I do, but I know there are none, at least that’s what I tell myself just to feel alright, because hope is the worst form of torture there is. 

I would always walk along the highways late at night with the sun still blazing in the back of my head. The neural synapses have been cut from my pathway since I met tongue to tongue with the beast of my own sanity. It ripped apart on the day I became that own monster inside myself, it ceased to exist as I became more corporal in my own head. Do you see me in the hallways and think, “he’s so sad, that little man of a boy?” Do you see the reasons my pupils turn to coal when I place the paper to miniscule little bursts of wet skin placed centimeters from teeth that could rip that same skin? I’m happy to be free of noise but the sound was a constant lullaby to the darkness in my fingers. They drew little lines all brazen and bolded in a pattern of chaos. I loved myself then, when I could feel the intelligence like a friend knocking on my senses. The feeling of deep connection to the earth was heavy in my ears. That’s who I am when no one is watching. I am that ghost on the side of a close to empty highway. Life’s ironies are most potent when no one’s around to witness.

I loved myself then, and I loved myself when I was younger too, like a fresh winter sprout on the tip of a tornado. I saw the humble beginnings of a failing thing and unhinged it from its desperate purchase on the parched ground. I sometimes wonder if plants are silently screaming in the cells of their water veins. Did you become so full just to wilt? Your swollen vacuoles become the dirt you were born from. I am lost, I am lost, I am lost, I am lost. I am dead and gone and not coming back, dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone. How can you love yourself if you don’t recognize yourself inside your head? Are we dead, are we dead. Is life merely a suspended reality where we hate each other just to get rid of insecurities?

I am so guilty; I hated you all so much. I took that hate deep within me and I turned it into oil. It spurted from my mouth and got into all my muscles tensing them up. It made my face ugly with anger and pity. It made my eyes shine with the light of a false ideology. I am the author of a cow sewn jacket full of fleas and chemicals. I am the beef within the external heart ripped by the hand of a brother who craved the feeling of organs and tissue in his head. It’s a chemical imbalance and it’s a way of living without guilt. I took the time to hug you when I was too tired to understand I needed comfort until it was too late. I laid within your warmth and I felt the lining of your smile on my skin where it touched my body. It was strange how I loved you in that moment and then grew steadily wearier the longer I let myself crave my own head over the world. I killed myself in the eve of that waking solitude. 

That’s what we are all wanting, we want to be known and recognized. That’s why we shy away from those who are different, that’s why we go so far as to hate those people too. To shun those people and tell them they are so very wrong. They must change and they are evil and freaks and ugly, ugly shame. Have you ever looked at a picture so long that it blurred inside itself and became so meaningless that nothing seemed real anymore? Have you ever seen something ugly and thought it was the most precious thing in the world? It represented the hurt and yourself and your mind and our life so well, that it became beautiful? Is that what this is? Have you ever looked at something that others found ugly and thought it was beautiful?

I wound up lifting my hand to the sun when I walked outside for the first time in a week. I holed myself up just to fix my panic. My panic inside, was raging against the walls of my skin and I was shaking and stuttering. Please let me go home, please let me be alone. Please, please, please don’t stand with your skin on me.

We were told the sun would dim slowly, like a fire with no more wood to feed the flame. It would expand and swallow the world, the same world which has housed everything we have ever known. But now, they trust me: Experiment 9K30. The last thing I witnessed before I stepped into that glistening wheat, aqua blue stream, were the eager eyes of the planet, wrapped with thoughts of return stories, and those who knew there wouldn't be one.



“9K30.”

His boots moving like hammers on the metal.

“*Commander*.”

He pauses in front of me, with scanning eyes. Deep down he's filled with complex intertwining thoughts, so convoluted that he remains silent.

“It's strange to think that this moment is finally here.”


Everything feels blank.


“Thousands of generations before us never thought that humanity would live long enough to actually witness this. ...They also didn't think it would happen this soon.”

We both just peer out into space, until the attention shifts.

“9K30 you know-”

“*I know, sir.*”

“Once we set foot-”

“*Sir.*”

He sighs.



“Out of all of them, I think we've made the best choice with you.”

“*Thank you, Commander*.”

“Don't you ever be the one thanking me, 9K.”



...With all of these metal plates and glass-like shields coating me, it's hard to remember that deep down inside I may actually be humane.

**EDIT**: I just thought I should mention that this is a smaller piece out of a larger work in progress.

Dez liked to race cars under the yellow glow of LA street lamps when Tory met him, but now people called him Desmond and he had no time for such impetuous acts. It's true that Tory had grown fond of the carte blanche that her black card afforded her and the charity dinners stimulated her, but the thrills in her life were limited by the creativity of the latest Bond film. She made a habit of reassuring herself how lucky she was, but she found herself increasingly difficult to convince. However, the thoughts of the comfort and safety Desmond provided were enough to calm most impulses. 

They were staying in The Victoria in Rio. Tory had never liked her given name, although she could appreciate the refined qualities of this hotel; it was much nicer than the one they had stayed at just down the road a year before.

As he lowered his Wall Street Journal, Desmond glanced superficially out the window. He thought briefly about the misfortune of those in the favelas. They live each day without knowing when they might be caught in the crossfire of their existence, he concluded. His own life had gone exactly as planned. His pride was buoyed by his two Princeton degrees and an impressive CV that was anchored by his latest position as Chief Financial Officer. For a moment he thought about how lucky Tory must feel to have captured his attention, but then he reminded himself not to be too proud. Besides, she was as much a catch as he. Her beauty was more rare than the flawless yellow diamond on her left hand. She was the type of girl that would cause an ordinary man to choke on a conversation, yet he had bravely taken her up with charm and confidence.  ""We're leaving in 5 minutes,"" Tory interjected. The humidity made her blouse stick to her curves and her sexuality was impossible to ignore. He couldn't remember where she had said they were going, but he pulled on his khakis and loafers. 

When the old Volkswagen finally arrived at the top of the hill,the view was astounding. Marcelo, the tan, smooth-talking tour guide pointed out the geography below. Tory watched as his defined arms drew imaginary lines all over the bay and rugged peaks. It was truly a remarkable site. Marcelo and his partner were experienced in dealing with Americans; always the same questions about the safety of hang gliding. He would usually explain that in the wrong hands, the wing could be very dangerous but that they had some of the best safety records in the world. It was true that there had only been one accident before, and it was a result of a panicked passenger rather than the pilot. 

Desmond was terrified. However, his face showed nothing but a confident expression. Through various nerve-wracking business interactions he had perfected the art of hiding his true feelings and he was glad to apply those skills in this situation. When they got in the beat up VW earlier that morning, Desmond asked Marcelo where they were headed. When he responded that they would be hang gliding over the city, Desmond immediately said there must be a mistake. ""The mistake is that I married someone who can no longer excite me""  Tory blurted out. She was no longer satisfied by comfort, and as the words escaped her mouth Desmond felt a dull pain in his gut; the kind that comes when you realize a loved-one has been ashamed of you for longer than you would like to imagine. Now was his time to prove her wrong. He would be the first to go and when he got to the bottom he would demand that Tory respect him for the man he is. 

Marcelo's partner would jump with Desmond. As she watched them suit up, Tory began to feel that maybe she had misjudged Desmond's complacency. She thought that he may just needed some encouragement to get out of his comfort zone; after all, he worked most days 9-5, and perhaps it was too harsh to blame him for wanting to relax. As she watched him jump she grew excited to see him at the bottom and share in the thrill of what she was about to endure. 

As quickly as Dez had disappeared below the horizon of the cliff, she felt her legs give out and watched the ground race towards her. Marcelo had punched the back of her head and before she could regain her wits she was being dragged by her hair across the dirt launching pad and into the woods. They were alone, but she screamed as loudly as she could. Marcelo kicked her in the ribs. She continued to struggle as he ripped open her blouse to reveal her full breasts that he had been imagining all day and then he pulled her shorts around her knees. He grew tired of her screams so he flipped her over and shoved her face in the dirt.

As he landed on the beach, Dez felt an immense sense of relief and a rush of adrenaline like he hadn't felt since before he met Tory. He couldn't restrain himself from a spontaneous hug with his guide. As he looked back towards where they had come from he noticed that Victoria had yet to jump. ""I knew she wouldn't have the guts to do it! She's all talk!"" he exclaimed10 minutes later. He felt victorious. ""Why don't you drop me back at the hotel so I can get a drink. I want Victoria to think about this on her own for a while."" His guide obliged.

and sparkling white snow lay undisturbed across the ground, silencing the 
world which it covered. It was on this day that I decided to take a long 
walk in the woods outside of the hustle and bustle of the city.
	As  I walked in the woods, I came upon an elder tree who had 
lived a great many years and whose bark harbored a great number of
 wounds. I brushed the thick, gleaming snow off of the tree’s tangled
 roots, which spread far and deep in all directions. Unto the roots I
 sat, and the tree accepted me as a friend upon its lap, though he
 knew not who I was or of what nature my intentions were. Naught 
else in this world would have ever accepted me so quickly and
 graciously, let alone trusted me so easily.
	For many hours there I sat, nurtured and nestled deep in the 
ancient and deep-reaching roots. In my time sat comfortably upon the
 tree I asked in a hushed tone what the tree had seen and felt in his
 many years, seated forever upon the land where he stood. The tree
 answered in words of silence, and by it I was taught to listen with my
 eyes, not my ears.
	‘I have been built upon.’ said he with the rotting plank in his branches;
 with the scars in his skin he said ‘I have been wounded.’; ‘I have been 
shelter for many lives.’ he said with the hole in his trunk and the abandoned
 birds-nest in his uppermost branch. He spoke very little, yet told very much. 
	‘I have travelled far,’ I said in reply. ‘I have been very many places, 
yet I fear I have seen less than you have, though you are rooted in this
 singular area. I have found little happiness to no avail, and I am plagued
 by my solitude which hangs over my head as a metal weight. I am not so
 wise as you are, my time is short on this planet and I, who has been born
 before you, is fated to die before you. I fear whether the choices I make
 in my life will be ill choices.’ I said, despair was shown so heavily in my voice.
	The tree listened well, and said nothing.
	‘I have no one on this earth who listens so well as you, tree.’
	The tree said naught, though I waited in vain for many hours.
	No advice was given to me that day, the tree never responded,
 but it held me tightly in its roots and I felt warm inside, despite the
 cold weather. The tree accepted me blindly, as nothing else would,
 or possibly ever will, it had done enough for me. Perhaps this tree
 had helped others, such as it had helped me; it had taken me in my pity.
	I walked to the woods that day with only the intention of feeling the
 cold air nip at my exposed skin; I left the woods that day enlightened,
 inspired by the kindness and unconditional love which the tree so openly
 gave out. I was changed, by something so simple as the comfort of a tree. 
Love can be found in the simplest things, I learned that day, and we are
 never alone so long as we choose to see the life around us.

          Rain dumped down over the fields of grass and surrounding buildings.  An American flag that should be waving in the breeze due to any imagery that our propaganda might show you, was so weighed down by the water that it gripped and hugged the pole it was leaning against.  A sad day they said, they said how could it be anything different than a sad day.  Thomas thought they lacked perspective.
	Thomas saw the love that the flag gave to that pole.  He saw nature feeding its grass and allowing it to grow.  He saw that the buildings always looked their best in a downpour.  But most of all he saw the truth.  He was unbarred from reality in times like these, seeing what he knows as opposed to what he has been told.  He has come to understand that rain was truth as the sunshine was propaganda.  Locked in this luminous state of mind that the rain and thunderclouds brought about; condensation left his lips as he released a breath of relief.
	“We truly know we are alive in times of pain.  Don’t you think?”  Thomas said looking toward his friend, Sam.
	Sam gave him a look of skepticism.  “That was really random.  How did you think of that?”
	They were in a building looking out of glass doors toward a flagpole.  To the left of the door was a picture of Uncle Sam dressed as a superhero.  Outside of the door, similar posters had been hung up, but the one that caught Thomas’s attention was the poster that had been detached from its surface by the rain and was now lying face down on the ground.  “I was simply observing my surroundings.  Let’s go back to the ceremony.”
	Thomas and Sam were currently enrolled in a military school.  Right now they were in the school auditorium waiting for the annual ceremony of graduates to begin.  This ceremony takes place every year after graduation.  The process entails each student going up to the microphone to announce his plans after school to the students, teachers, families, and deans of the academy.  It was essentially a ceremony to shame the students into a worthwhile endeavor proceeding their scholastic career.  It was quite an out of date ceremony, started in a time when a fascist government managed to convince its people it was capitalist.  A time when authority ruled over common sense and rationality.  Though technically capitalist, the persona of the culture seemed to shout Nazi ideals from the rooftops.
	The first student stepped up to the mic with his chest thrust out and announced, “I will be attending West Point Academy,” with a great pride and enthusiasm, whistles and yells followed.  The next student was a repeat performance and this uniformed debauchery continued in the same way throughout the ceremony.  The few changes that were made in each speech were only tone of voice and a difference in military universities. 
	When Thomas stepped up to the mic, he thrust his chest out with a great pride and announced his plans to travel around the world and work for whoever would hire him.  Thomas took a deep breath and looked around at his audience.  They were all open-mouthed and completely silent.  Thomas took a breath of air from the world for the first time.  He had finally bitten the hand that fed him poison and looked toward a future with no goals; a taste of freedom at last.

I can feel the wind on my bare back, and the soft moss beneath my feet. Pausing on a hill, I curl my toes into the soft earth and look out at the sunset. For anyone else, it would be a beautiful sight. For me, it is terrifying. I have maybe two minutes left as I scramble quickly down the hillside. I reach a small clearing and begin making my markings. A circle in the dirt, and X on each tree, and taking the brush out of my pack, I mark the center of the circle with an X of my blood. As I head to my pack for my clothes, I run out of time. I hasten back to the center of the circle as the sun goes down. The moonlight filters through the trees, and my terrible night has begun. 


Running, wind whipping back the fur. There’s no one in sight, no one! Wait! There! There is a fire. There are people. Charging, leaping, biting, tearing. Screams, blood, scattered ashes of the fire. Roaring, scaring. Feasting.


I wake up on the forest floor, in the center of the circle. I’m shivering, and I quickly go to my pack and get my clothes. Hearing a crack, I turn quickly, dropping my pants and falling into a low crouch. There is a man standing behind a tree with a camera phone. In the early stages after the metamorphosis, I still retain some of my speed and strength. I charge forward and before the man has time to react I am in front of him, lifting him into the air by his throat. I pitch my voice low and intimidating and I growl, “What are you doing?” The man confuses me then. Rather than being afraid of the man holding him inches off the ground by his throat, he spits in my face. “You killed my friend,” he says, “But now I know who you are, and I've sent your picture to some very powerful people.” I drop the man and back up. No, it wasn't possible! I had searched the forest, made sure there were no people. I sit down on a tree stump and bury my face in my hands. “No,” I groan, “No! I came out here to make sure there was no one for me to hurt. I’m sorry! Oh, my God, I’m so sorry!” But when I look up, the man is gone. He has fled from the monster.


After gathering my pack and brush, I follow my own tracks from last night. It isn't hard. I left a path of destruction through the forest. Although my trail is easy to follow, it is long. I had woken around nine in the morning, and it is now nearing noon. Finally, I arrive at the campsite. There are still tents, and ashes and logs from a long-dead fire are scattered across the area. But the sight in the center of the camp makes me sick, and I turn aside and vomit into the shrubbery. I apparently had not finished my meal last night. Lying in the center of the camp, in a shiny pool of sticky crimson, is a human arm. I had come out to this forest so I wouldn't hurt anyone. Now I am a murderer.  I stagger sickly back the way I had come, to the circle and markings I had made. I don’t understand why it works, but every time I start in are that I marked that way, I return to that spot after the transformation.  I reflect on my life so far as I walk. I've been living like this for three years now. Thirty six times I have transformed, despite my continued attempts, short of suicide, to stop it. I never remember what happens, but from news reports I know that I have killed twelve people, and last night made thirteen. An unlucky number.


I return to my circle in the dirt and the markings I had made to attract the Wolf. I've always preferred to treat that part of me as a different person altogether. In a way, it is. The Wolf does things I would never consider doing, it is different then me in every possible way. It has no intelligent thoughts, no higher conscience. It hunts, that’s all it does. Its sole purpose in life is to hunt and to kill. Luckily, I can never remember what the Wolf does. I am glad of this. I believe that if I knew what the Wolf did…what I did…I would kill myself. Suddenly, I want to leave. I do not wish to remain here any longer. So, taking my pack, I head home.


It is a long walk home, and I haven’t a driver’s license. I used to have one. I had a really nice car, too. It was a Mustang GT convertible. It came time to renew my license two years ago, but given recent events, it did not rank high on my priorities. What did rank high was finding a job that would allow me to take at least three days a month for vacation time. I didn’t want to transform anywhere near my small home town in the suburbs of Austin. I found a job as an author. As it turns out, having undergone the transformation several times myself, I was able to write a rather good werewolf fantasy novel that sold decently. It was perfect for me. Successful enough that I could make a living off it, but not so successful as to make me a celebrity and attract attention. A few people recognize me now and then, but not a lot. I come out of the woods, walking across the open grass lands and heading towards the city I vacationed in. The walk has taken me about six hours, and it is now nearing 6:30. I’m quite hungry at this point, and so when I reach the city around 7:00 I head for a fast food place rather than home. The kid behind the counter recognizes me and keeps me at the counter for about ten minutes while he babbles about my book.  Finally, I take my food and sit down to eat around 7:30. Great fast food, I think, only took me twenty minutes for me to get it. As I chew, I feel something in my mouth besides hamburger meat. Reaching in with my fingers, I pull it out from under my tongue. My teeth are still sharp, as they will be for a few days after the transformation, and I cut my finger on one. I look down and see what was in my mouth. It is a fingernail. A human fingernail. I grimace and look at my burger, knowing that the fingernail hadn't come from there. I have taken two bites. I throw it away and head home. I’m not hungry now anyway.


I open the door to my apartment and start to turn on the lights when something stops me. It’s what I've come to call my Wolf sense, another lingering effect after the transformation. For two weeks afterwards I have an animal-like instinct for danger. I scan the dark room, able to see better than most as a result of the lingering transformation effects. I can see signs of someone being in the house. A corner of the rug is turned over, and a couch cushion is on the floor. I see him then, or at least his fingers poking out from under the couch. It’s a usual, unimaginative hiding place. After each person I've killed, someone has seen it. Most of the time they do not know who I am, but six times I've been discovered. Six times I've had to fight for my life and kill as a human. After the third time, I enrolled in martial arts classes. For the fourth time now, I bless the day I made that decision.

 I decide not to arouse suspicion until I am in a good position, and then let him make the first move. Flicking on the lights, I head into the living room and stand in front of the TV, directly in front of the couch, but I do not turn the TV on. Instead, I watch the reflection in the TV screen, pretending to be texting someone on my phone, as the man rises up from behind the couch. He is wielding a knife. As he creeps closer, I tense my body in anticipation for action. Finally, he gets close enough for me to act. I drop down and roll behind me, taking his legs out from under him. As he falls, I catch his knife arm and wrench it behind his back in a hammerlock. I kneel on top of him and take the knife, preparing to drive it into the back of his neck. 


The sound of a gunshot echoes loudly in the small apartment. I look up and see a man in a suit standing in the open doorway. He is holding a gun. Looking down at the man beneath me, I see a drop of blood fall onto his neck. I realize this is the man from the forest earlier today. I look down at my white shirt and see a scarlet circle spreading slowly from my heart. My fingertips grow cold and numb, and the knife clatters to the ground as I’m unable to hold it any longer.
 “Detective Bradford,” says the man with the gun, introducing himself, “And you killed my partner last night, you goddamned animal.”  The coldness has now spread to my arms and my legs, and I topple sideways off the man from the forest. He gets up and spits on my face.
 “But you missed one, eh? You missed his brother, huh?” He taunts with a thick Cockney accent. “Stupid blighter.”
“Come on,” says Bradford, “Someone will have heard that.” 


As they exit, the cold spreads to everywhere except my chest, and I am slowly losing my vision. I wonder if the bullet in my heart is silver. It doesn't need to be when I am in human form, but these men wouldn't know that. I can be killed by anything; it’s the Wolf who is invincible. It’s the Wolf who killed Bradford’s partner. I open my mouth to speak to these two men as they leave, but I cannot move, and I cannot feel my tongue in my mouth. But I want to say something. I so desperately want to speak to these men. These men who killed me, assuming that I was a monster like the Wolf. These men who assume that it is acceptable to kill me because, in their eyes, I am not human. To them, I am an animal, a dumb, mindless, murdering beast. I want so badly to talk to these self-righteous men who see fit to kill me without understanding who or what I am, without knowing the whole story. Without even making an effort to find out. But I don’t. I die. I die before I can say what I wanted to these two men. I die before I can say…

No More Than Four

Charlie Sacks was as sick as they come. He had taken to bed nearly three days ago and didn't say a word about it. The housemaid Martha waited on him hour to hour, pleasing him with an assortment of soups and teas. He took it presently and surprisingly enough, never did he miss a meal. While his stomach may have been in good order, the ailment seemed to lie in his nasal cavity. The man suffered from a clogged nasal chimney, due to a snot and spit build up, resulting in a whooping fever! Charlie, as a sturdy grown man, knew the only true remedy was a pampering spa and a warm bed. Martha had prepared a bath and Mr. Sacks found comfort in its bubbly waters. From the womb to the sack he did leap. Leaving the bath only to flounder back into bed. The fluffed feathers of his nest proved the greatest comforter, for it was in it's billows he could delve into the latest issue of StarExplorer in peace. 

Alas, here is where I found him. A boy in his castle. With three loud knocks on their oakwood door, I made my presence known. Martha greeted me as I leaned against my wooden cane. 

""Evening sir, mighty dark and rainy out there, what can I do for you?"" 

""I be but a humble traveller mum, on the eternal road, I come to beg you for bread."" 

""From where do you come, Traveller?""

""From the land beyond our own! Past the light and through the stone! In the forest, birds have flown, into the greatest deep unknown!""

""Where is that exactly?""

""Delaware, ma'am""

""Please step into the light, so I may gaze your face.""

Indeed I followed her request and exposed myself to her. Every griping part of me. She no doubt reacted to my lame eye. The haggard mess of scarred skin will cause a double glance from anyone. I stood there, with the porch light bouncing off my darkened cloak, giving the softest exposure to my grey locks and twisted jaw. I knew I was something she had never seen before.

""Well, no sense having you out there, I invite you in for warmth and bread. Shall we?""

""Thank you, Ma'am""

""Dearie, call me Martha""

""Certainly"" 

At once, she invited me into the library, where I sat by the fire and indulged a few lines from a StarExplorer magazine. She was off into the kitchen to prepare me some bread and a bowl of something or other. The library was dark and civil. I admired the eclectic collection of novels and memoirs, as well as the embroidered chair in which I was placed. The leather had taken the shape of my body and I felt for a moment a grace of rest. 

""You're meal, sir""

""Remarkable, Martha, you were able to put all that together in the short time I was here?""

""No sir, I happen to be mending another weary soul.""

""There is another in this house?""

""Yes, the owner of the estate, Master Charlie Sacks."" 

""Whatever is wrong with the poor devil?""

""Doctor says it's a nasal buildup, sounds awful, like a dying rodent at times""

""Martha, would I be able to speak with Master Sacks? I feel I have a remedy in my possession that he would find most intriguing.""

Three flights of stairs we took, all winding and weaving through the museum of his halls. From floor to floor, the walls displayed paintings from eras I had yet to see. I felt compelled to ask what Martha made of it.

""Paintings"", I remarked.

""Oh yes, the Master collects. He has gone all over the world to find these paintings. Some he had to risk life and limb for. The floor below us holds the ones with pretty ships in them. Ships at port saying goodbye to the folk waving on the dock. Ships battling the raging squalls of the open sea. Ships a plenty. The floor we're on now will have your bones shivering.""

""Ma,am?"" 

""This is his gothic collection. Everyone from Dorian Grey to The Oval Portrait hangs here. Let's just say we scurry past this part. Shall we?""

I could see her distress. For most of the men and women that hung here were depicted in death. My good eye gazed on scenes of immurement, bloodied ruins of genocide and twisted feasts of cannibalism. I shuddered as I glimpsed a familiar face burning in the fires of a witch hunt. 

The last floor presented a welcomed change in the form of landscapes. As we crossed the hall to Sacks bedroom, I was treated to views of mountain ranges and auburn fields of apples. 

Martha gently opened the door and announced us to the figure laying in bed.

""Master Sacks, we have Mr…""

""Crypt, Ernie Crypt. Master Sacks, I've come seeking shelter from the storm. As it turns out I found a little bit more. I heard of your ailment and I have a remedy that can promise you better. A rare chance for me to pay back such a hospitable welcome.""

The silence made me wonder if he was resting eternally. At last he spoke, ""Bring it to me and leave it on my nightstand.""

With a nod to Martha I lurched over to his bedside and from my cloak retrieved a sack of cherry tomatoes. 

""These are picked from a place I doubt even you've been, Mister Sacks. Please I will leave the bag here, but I warn you, only four tomatoes shall you eat before sunrise. Any more, will have you. Indeed, save them for tomorrows light.""

""Tomatoes? Is this a folly?""

""None, sir, trust me. You will be surprised by natures touch.""

""Very well then, be gone with you.""

As I exited to the hallway, I left him with four words of remembrance.

""No more than four"".

Martha allowed me to finish my meal and then filled my canteen with water, gave me a dry towel and then saw me on my way. I was eager to go, not because I held distaste for Martha's company, but because I knew sunrise would be here in a matter of hours and I wanted a good distance behind me when it came.

Within an hour, Master Sacks gave in to my gesture. Two tomatoes he took at first reach. He was surprised to find that he was soon sitting up and stretching his arms to and fro. He thought better then to over do it, so he settled back in with his magazine. A few more hours past and still the nagging taste of a tomato sat on his tongue. He had never tasted one so rich and rationed that he would still be under his four tomato limit. He settled that he deserved one more at least. The third one was in his mouth in a flash and the result was so tremendous that he threw the covers onto the floor and wreathed around his bedsheets stretching and yawning. The slumber was fading behind him and he soon felt fit to stand up. Yet something stayed him. He was thinking of his knowledge of medicine.

""My doctor always said, finish the bottle or it won't work."" He reasoned quietly.

By the time he was chewing his fourth tomato, Sacks was walking down the hall to fetch a cup of milk. 

""Heavens, sir, a change of winds?"" Martha gasped as Sacks entered the kitchen.

""Martha it seems our weary traveller spoke truth. Those tomatoes did a wonder on my senses. I feel fit enough to read in the dignity of my own library. First, I shall like a glass of milk.""

""Certainly, sir, I'll bring it right in.""

Master Sack's toes wiggled around the fire heat as he sunk into his chair. A few adjustments were made until he felt the familiar shape again. Martha came in and left a tall glass of milk on the table beside him. She left him to read StarExplorer. A wonderful serial involving flying machines in space and men with laser guns finding lost princesses. The adventure had pulled him in for nearly an hour when he was distracted to see, inside the pocket of his house coat, the sack of tomatoes. 

""A wonder."" he thought.

As he continued to read, he thumbed the ripe, round tomatoes almost unaware of his habit. It took only a few minutes before another tomato was out of the sack and into his mouth. Half expecting to feel superhuman, Sacks was distraught to find that a cold chill instantly cascaded through his bones. The impact caused him to drop his magazine onto the floor. As he reached down to pick it up, a searing pain shot through his lower back. He tried to scream, but only gasped, for his breath was failing him. Sweat was accumulating and as he wiped his brow he felt only wrinkles of elderly skin. He willed himself a sip of milk. When he lay the glass back on the table he saw a line of red smearing down the side of the glass. Could his mouth be bleeding? He flustered over to the mirror to inspect. Yet the startling sight of his ghost and the ripe taste of tomato stopped him. A vision of auburn apple fields and infinite galaxies filled his eyes. Master Sacks fell to the floor. The old boy was dead.

No doubt Martha discovered him within the hour. Her shriek would be heard by no one. For the estate stands miles from anyone wishing to hear. No doubt she would take to the door to look for the strange traveller who had seemingly betrayed them. Yet she would not find him, only a discarded cane. For a cane is used by lame eyed old gypsies, not those who ride with fresh eyes into the eternal sunrise.

He plays the wolf’s howl and the banshee’s scream. The old man had a beard of thick black hair like wool which so long it dragged when he walked, which was very seldom. He plays blood lust, and silver bullets. His body was fragile and hunched over. He seldom moves, but is never found in the same place. He taught the sirens how to sing. His eyes have gone white from blindness, but he knows where you are, and knows that you’re watching. 

They teach the children not to wonder in the woods after the final church bell rings, because the witching hour is close at hand.  No one knows exactly when it begins, or exactly when it ends, all they know is that it happens and that is all they need to know. All the adults keep pocket watches and know to be inside when they notice the ticking start to slow. 

The children always ask why they cannot play, they don’t want to go to bed its too early, but their parents tuck them in away. They warn them of the witching hour, and the man with the fiddle. 

Somebody once said that they knew a girl who didn’t listen. She went through the woods late one night; she had plans to meet a boy on the opposite side.  The boy waited all night, and when day light came she hadn’t appeared so he went to look for her. No one knows what happened for sure but people tell it like this: 

They say that the girl never made it because she ran into the man with the fiddle. It’s said that she walked through the woods like she normally would, having lived there her whole life she knew the grounds fairly well but as she walked she stumbled upon an unusual clearing that was surrounded by a thick, white fog. She heard a voice, “what would you like to hear,” and then she noticed that there was a man sitting on a small stool with his back to her. She cried out to him, “I don’t know where I am,” but he ignored her and repeated, “what do you want to hear.”  The girl started to tremble in fear realizing what she’d done, it was the witching hour and she was alone. 

The girl took off with great swiftness, dodging tree branches and hopping over roots that sought to trip her up. She looked behind her panting to see if the man had somehow given chase, seeing nothing she turned around relieved to find that she was again back in that clearing and this time the man was facing her. 

“That was very rude of you, all I want to do is play you a song. I’ll ask again, what do you want to hear,” he asked this and looking up at her finally she looked helplessly into his shockingly white eyes and she couldn’t move.  “I know what you want to hear,” he said with a small laugh, and he raised his fiddle and bow. 

No one had heard from the girl for two weeks, until a hunter and his dog found her. She was in rags, hair matted with mud. Her eyes were completely black, iris and sclera, black. She was screaming, about a song. There was a song playing in her head and she couldn’t get  it out. The hunter tried to calm her but she fought him off, still screaming about a song. She moved with swiftness and grabbed the hunter’s gun, and before he could shout one bit of protest she had the gun to her head and fired. 

During the full moon it’s said that the man can draw you in. There is a story that once he drew in two young lovers. 

“Ahh, to be young and in love. What would you like to hear?” 

The woman spoke up first, “where are we?” 

“You are in heaven my dear. Yes, you are in a beautiful place. What would you like to hear?” 

The man was just about to speak when the old man started to speak again, “no. I know what you want to hear,” and he raised his fiddle and bow. 

A month later they were found. The couple was bone thin, naked, and covered in dried blood. An old woman found them while she was checking her traps for rabbits. She cried out in horror when she found them. “Don’t look away, we’re only dancing,” they said in unison. 

Sometimes if you’re lucky, or unlucky, no one knows which, you can go into the woods and they are still dancing.  People argue that they are dead, have been dead since the night they got lured in, and other  say they are alive, and they are doomed to be alive, forever, forever dancing. 

Fools, there are always fools that don’t believe the legend, they call it folklore and they try to find the man with the fiddle. Some go to the woods and they come back out unharmed, and they say there is no man, but all those who have seen the man have never lived to tell, except for one. There were two friends who were stalking a deer to try to get a meal  to settle their empty stomachs when they was caught by the man with the fiddle. 

“Hello,” the little man said.

“Whose there,” one friend asked, voice trembling in fear.

“What would you like to hear?” 

“Who are you? Are you the devil?” asked the second
 
“The devil? What is the devil?” 

The two did something no one else had thought to do, he started to pray. 

Neither of them heard or seen the man move, but they opened their eyes from their prayers and the man was standing underneath them looking right at them with his blind white eyes, he pointed his bow under the chin of one of the friends and said to the other, “you called me the devil.”
 
“I- I’m sorry. Please let us go,” the friend begged. 

“I play songs, I am a simple fiddler, what would you like to hear?” 

“Can you play anything?”

“Anything you wish.” 

“There is this song my wife would sing before she died, I don’t know what it’s called but do you think you can play it?” 

The little fiddler stood there silently, and then replied, “certainly,” and sat down in the stool which seemed to materialize out of no where. Then when the little fiddler raised his bow and fiddle, some of the fog gathered itself and a ghost appeared. The ghost was a translucent form of a woman with large eyes and long hair. The man cried out to it, “Ramona.” 

“You asked for your wife’s song,” and the man started to play. 

The man walked up to his wife’s ghost and held out his hand for her. When she took it though the fog gathered around him and he began to dissolve, becoming part of the fog too. His friend cried out for him, he wanted to save him, but the fiddler told him to go, he had nothing to play him, and so he went. But as he left he looked back and seen his friend had become a ghost, and he and his wife were dancing. 

Do not go out late at night, because it isn’t safe. As people moved out of villages by the woods to major cities the fiddler has moved to. He is the phantom at the end of the hallway, or an apparition at the end of the alley. He owns the night. He just wants to play you a song.

We was rarely seen, and only summoned when there was no other solution. The village people below told stories of his once-powerful abilities. He could move mountains, change the flow of a river, and even part clouds whenever he wanted to. However it had been a long time since any of the villagers had seen any fantastical work done by the wizard, and so, they lost hope. One day, a few of the young village children wandered up the road in search of the old Wizard's home. They were curious to see if the wizard would show them some of his magic. When they arrived at the small cottage they noticed that it looked as though no one had lived there in years. They peered through the dusty windows and attempted to see inside, but all that could be seen was darkness. When they turned around an old man was smiling at them. ""What are you youngins doing up here?"" the old man asked them. ""We were hoping to see some of your magic!"" one of the children exclaimed excitedly. ""Magic? Why would want to see something like that?"" the old man asked them. ""Because we have heard the stories! They say you can do things no other person can!"" another one said, almost shouting. ""They say that, but has anyone in the village ever seen it?"" the man asked with a grin. ""Well no, but thats why we were hoping you could show us!"" said the oldest of the children. ""Well Im sorry, I've lost my magic abilities. But, if you care to stay, I can give you some advice on any problems you may be having"" the man offered them, hoping to not be left so quickly. ""Advice? We came to see magic, and if you dont have any, we are leaving"" one of the kids exclaimed as he started walking back down towards the village. The other children followed closely on his heels and the old man was left outside his cottage, watching them as they left. When the children returned to the village they told their friends about what had happened. They began to call him the Dumb Wizard since we did not possess any magic. The name caught on quickly in the village and soon it was his identity. As the name changed for the Dumb Wizard, so did his stories. They no longer involved cloud parting, river changing, mountain moving fantasies, but instead told of his advice he would give to the young. As the generations began to come and go and long after the old Wizard had died, his stories remained as just the advice he gave. The village called this advice Wizdumb. The word, along with the advice associated with it, soon evolved in their language and spread around the land.

     In the beginning, Dave created a bunch of stuff like the earth, water, animals, and humans. He thought ""Meh, it's cool I guess..."", and then he pretty much sat back and watched everything unfold, chillin' like a villain and taking many forms. Mostly though he liked to be a plastic dove. He saw all his creations screw up the world he created, and it pissed him off pretty badly. He thought for centuries about how he could save the world he put so little effort into creating.

     One day, in the late 1990's he came up with a plan. It was about time too, because the world he created was in pretty pitiful condition by this time. He set out to create 5 strong men who would spread his holy name. One of them appearing to be a heretic, but obviously a believer. One of them a natural born leader to guide the prophets. One of them tall and strong willed and convert others. One of them with great musical talents with which to sing and play instruments in the name of Dave, and the last one. Dave's only son. He arranged so that these men would one day come together and use their own talents to spread the word of Dave.

     These young men grew and realized their talents (except for the son of Dave, who had a hard time because he had not yet recognized his true purpose in life). They misused their talents, however, because they did not know that their destiny was the destiny that Dave set for them. They would know in the future that Dave needed them to rid the world of ignorance and stupidity. It would take time, though, for them to be ready for the task at hand.

     By the time these 5 young men were ready for their destiny, the world was even worse than it was before. There had been terrorist attacks, wars, destruction in massive proportions. They were indeed ready at the last minute. The 5 boys had grown to be good friends, and were like family. One day, fate brought them all together, and set them on a journey that would open their eyes to the truth. Open their eyes to Dave. 

    They found themselves in their leader's house, discussing the most important of current events, politics, economics, history, and other things of the like. Then, as fate may have it, they embarked on a journey. They started with a trip to a local general store to purchase liquid refreshment, and to win the heart of a fair maiden. They failed miserably at the winning the heart part, but succeeded in buying refreshments. They also caused the son of Dave to smudge a dipping sauce on his trousers. They then headed to a larger store to buy him a new pair of trousers.

     They failed in their quest to acquire new trousers, but had good hearty laughs and made the son wear clothes meant for girls. However, it was here that they discovered The Great Dave. They found him in his usual form, a plastic bird, perched upon a raised surface. They were drawn to him, and immediately knew that it was to be theirs. They did not know why, but they knew it must be.

     They purchased the plastic bird, took him home, and immediately idolized him. They knew that his name was to be Dave, and that he was of great importance. The boys did not truly understand that Dave was of much more importance until much later. The day after their trip to the store, their land was ice-ridden. The plants outside were enveloped in a solid sheet of ice, and the roads were only traversible by foot, because none of their automobiles were equipped to operate on the ice-covered roads.

     The young men grew hungry, and weary of being held inside their home, and by the will of Dave, which they still failed to recognize, decided to embark on a long journey to obtain cheap, delicious food. They left their home and started down the road, talking and laughing, unaware of the great events that awaited them. They would soon find out the true purpose of what was happening.

     They noticed a bird that looked exactly like their plastic bird that was perched upon a telephone wire. Then they realized that this, in fact, WAS their bird, but in the form of a living version of it's plastic form, guarding them, and guiding them. They then began to realize that they had a greater purpose in this journey, and that Dave was more than a mere plastic bird.

     They began to have revelations and realizations that Dave placed in their minds. They came to the conclusion that Dave was the true God, and that they were prophets, since they were the only ones who realized this truth. They then realized that the one with no apparent useful talent must have been the son of Dave, because of the hardships he faced and trials and tribulations. They realized that since he had no talent to offer Dave, he didn't require one, because him simply being among the other prophets was enough to please Dave.

     Then came their true sign that they were led by The Great and Powerful Dave. They noticed on the side of the path a beautiful sight. A useless, disappointing, fresh, beautiful sight. They knew in their hearts that Dave put this there for them, that he loved them, and that he wanted them to cleanse the world of the wrongness that had befallen it.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_17b03s,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/17b03s/the_book_of_dave/,

Alex had a dream he will never forget. The dream was of him and his friend Jake lying in bed naked, cuddling up on each other peacefully sleeping, when they both wake up and start kissing when Jake whispers 

*""I love you, Alex"".* 
Alex responds as he's tightly holding Jake 
*""Don't let me go, Jake"".* 
Jake whispers back 
*""I won't... I'll hold you and keep you warm until the Sun comes""* Alex leans in as he says 
*""Jake...""* 
Their faces coming closer to each other like magnets. Their mouths about to touch... 

But then Alex woke up to the sound of his alarm clock. Confused as to what he just experienced, he whispered ""... What the hell was that.."". Alex and Jake being best friends since the 8th grade, this dream came as a shock to Alex. 

Alex eventually shock it off as best as he could and went to get dressed for school. He caught the bus listening to one of his friend's song that he promised to listen to and tell her what he thought. 

""... Wow, this is actually good."" He chuckled to himself quietly. But then, a line was in a song that echoed through Alex's mind through the whole bus ride.

*""... I'll hold you and keep you warm until the Sun rises...""*

The dream came back to Alex. Every last detail of it. Alex was hit by so many emotions at once it was hard trying to see how he could react to it. But, when Alex got to school and met his friends he forgot it almost immediately. One of his friends, Jordan, asked where Jake is. Alex replied,

""Oh, Jake's grandparents are over from Switzerland and so he's off."" Jordan was annoyed.

""What the fuck? And the school let him? That's so unfair! I tell the school I'm sick and they won't let me go, but Jake gets a pass for his grandparents?""

""Well, that's because the school knows you're calling bullshit."" Alex replied while chuckling. Everyone agreed and laughed. Jordan still annoyed. Then, the bell rang and they went to their classes. 

The whole day seemed so long, he was wondering when it was ever going end. Just as the bell rang letting the students know that they are free to go, Alex got a text from Jake that read

*""Come to my house, I need to tell you something""*
Alex texted back 
*""Sure, but what do you want to tell me"".*
*""I don't think I should tell you through text""*
*""At least give a hint""*
*""Haha no.""*
*""Damn you, you fucking tease haha, I'm on my way""*
*""Thanks, dude :) ""*


Alex got to Jake's house at around 5 and he knocked on the door. The door answered to Jake.

""Hey man, how's it going?""
""Just fine, dude."" Alex's face looked uneasy to Jake because the sight of Jake's face reminded him of the dream.

""... You alright, man?""
""Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you grandparents?""
""Oh, they went out to dinner with my parents and won't be back until 9.""
""So you're alone then. Nice.""
They both laughed and walked into the house and Alex told Jake about how pissed Jordan was about the situation. They both went up into Jake's room. And then Alex asked ""Anyway, what did you want to talk about?""

""Oh... yeah..."" Jake's face grew with anxiety.
""I had a dream last night...""
Alex chuckled. ""Yes, and so did more than half of the population.""
""Shut up."" Jake responded and they both laughed.
""This dream was... unique.""
""How so?"" Alex responded.
""Okay, I'm just going to say it. It was you and me in bed having sex. There, I said it."" Alex's face grew with confusion and worrisome. After a few minutes of silence Alex got the courage to admit he had a similar dream ""I... had the same dream..."" Alex said with hesitation. Jake turned to Alex with shock.

""What?"" Jake whispered. ""Oh man, that is creepy.""
""I mean it wasn't exactly that, but it was similar."" Alex said.
They were looking into each other's eyes for a bit, then Alex bursted out saying ""But, it doesn't mean anything. It was just a stupid dream.""
""Yeah... o- of course it was..."" Jake said.
""I mean, I'm not gay and... I don't..."" Alex paused to catch his breathe for he was slightly panicing. ""I have to go..."" Alex said while grabbing his bag to go in a rush. He ran to the door until he felt a hand on his shoulder pulling him back. He turned around and saw Jake. Jake's hand moved from his shoulder to his waist. Then Jake passionately kissed Alex. Alex hesitated at first, but then Alex rapped his arms around Jake's neck and showed the same passion back to Jake.

Jake grabbed Alex's hand and the two ran to his room and jumped on his bed. The two fell onto the bed and they kissed each other again with the same passion, if not more. Jake started to take off Alex's shirt and Alex did the same for Jake. Jake whispered into Alex's ear while he was on top of him ""I've liked you for a long time, I was going to tell you on your 16th, but I couldn't do it."" Then Jake started kissing Alex's neck. Alex whispered ""I've liked you too, but I couldn't admit to myself."" Jake's kiss moved from his neck to his chest, undoing Alex's belt and throwing it aside, his pants along with it. Alex slowly pulled down his boxers and pulled out his hard penis. Jake looked at Alex with a lustful smile and kissed him again. Jake did the same, but practically tore off his clothes. Jake took out a condom from his wallet that was on the floor and put it on while kissing Alex's neck. He rolled it on and Alex spread his legs very eagerly. Jake slowly put it in him. Alex moans because this is the first time he had anything like this, but it felt so good to him. He felt this warm sensation in his stomach. It felt like he was completed, like a puzzle piece being placed. Without realising, Alex came allover himself and a little of it on Jake, but he didn't care. All he cared about was the feeling of Jake's penis inside of him. 

Jake finally came and the two stayed in silence embracing the experience of each other's warmth. Jack eventually rolled off Alex and the two started cuddling and their legs wrapped together with Alex lying on Jake's chest. They laid there for a very long time until Alex looked up at Jake and said ""Looks like those dreams did mean something after all"" They both smiled at each other. ""Wait, what time did you say your parents would be back again? Alex asked.

""Oh.. um 9.""
""What time is it now?""

Jake checked his phone and it read ""8:59"". The two jumped up and rushed to get their clothes back on and get themselves organised before Jake's parents and grandparents get home. The two were in such a rush, they even started falling over. It made them laugh which made it even harder. When they eventually got dressed, Alex got his bag and was prepared to run home if necessary. Jake and him ran to the door and before Alex left Jake gave him one passionate kiss again, they both smiled and Alex ran with a gleaming smile on his face. When he got home, his parents were having dinner

""Oh, look who decided to come home after almost 4 hours. How was Jake?""
""He's fine."" Alex replied without realising he still had that gleaming smile on his face.

""You look happy, so I'm assuming you had fun?""

Alex's smile grew bigger as he replied

The soldier slowly awoke to the sound of rain tapping out Morse code on his windowpane. Amid the murmuring drumming he lay already defeated, simply staring above into the white paint swirls of the high attic ceiling. The room itself was enormous, in the far corner away from the bed a few ladder rungs poked up from the moist floorboards, whilst the soldier’s bed and a few old boxes scattered throughout the room provided the only real decoration. 


The doctors had urged sunlight, yet ever since they hauled his bed upstairs and dragged it beside the enormous bay window; it simply had not stopped raining. Jenny though had seen the bright side of the dismal days, arguing as they ate their meals together in the attic that the rain could help him relax. That in a certain respect he should think of himself lucky with such a sea view, that he should feel sheltered and secure near the window rather than the imprisonment he oft complained of. To the soldier it was all white wet noise, unrelenting and monotonous. With great effort he shifted on his shoulder to see the clock just tick to six, his hand reached for the bell beside the bed but he knew it was far too early to wake Jenny. Just as the young man was about to fall back into sleep, a brief cry escaped down below from the beach outside. 

The sea view from the back of the house had been the main reason they had bought the place, and even in the gums of winter the mixture of crashing ocean and bone white beach exuded a consummate calm. From the back porch of the house, a small sandy garden that begun at the bottom of the patio steps gave way to the pale beach that rolled out before the lapping waves. 

2.

When the two of them had climbed the ladder to the attic with a few other newlyweds all those years ago, he had gripped Jenny’s hand in excitement upon spying the open space before the vast bay window. They hadn’t even asked a price yet and already he was eager, seeing in his head a thick wooden desk before the perfect view, with rows upon rows of bookcases encircling the high white walls. Now his books collected in various corners, falling out of cardboard boxes that flaked from the moisture of the mostly empty room. The window itself was enormous with a cross work of black mesh on the pane shaping the various frames within it. It took up much of the attic wall, almost doing justice in its size to the sea that unfurled out before it. Though he was physically fine to write after the assault in France, the desk was never bought, all his previous passion for Literature seemingly seeping away upon his return to Jenny and the house. 

As soon as the soldier found the source of the yelp, he questioned if what he was seeing down below through the window was some form of hangover from the relentless medication. Propping himself up, both elbows clearly defined through his skin against the windowsill he spied two boys, one fairly young standing beside what seemed to be merely the head of the other submerged in the sand. The children appeared to be chatting amiably, though the boom of the surging surf behind them smothered anything said. The soldier soon smiled however as he noticed it was merely the angle of the window lattice from where he was looking out that had suggested a severed head on account of the boy. It seemed the child was just standing in a dug hole, one that looked surprisingly deep and wide as the tall child climbed out unaided with much effort amid the moistening sand. 

The downpour was growing heavier now and the boys appeared to the soldier from above, to hasten as they began to dig even further into the now clay-like ground. Shovels lay flat beside the pit but for whatever reason they were now clawing with their palms, tossing sand in every direction, stopping every now and then for a breath of two. It took a few minutes of surveillance but the soldier realized that he had seen them a few times around the town, two brothers. Before his view of the siblings, thick droplets were now amassing quickly on the pane. Rarely was the rain this insistent or obscuring. 

They were always together in his mind; an image in particular of them sharing a single ice cream before one of the town square storefronts struck him as oddly memorable. Most vividly however he recalled their rowdiness at the parade for the departing soldiers that had been held almost a year before. Amongst the bulging crowd they charged and darted with no concern but that the other not get ahead, seemingly reveling in the chance of an audience. A few of the crowd disputed, attempting to grab them in an effort of respect, but they were too liquid. This was before the rain came and the small square was unfittingly beautiful that day. Near everyone in the town crowded all around as convoys of men waved uncertain goodbyes to people they had only really considered background. After the last truck disappeared beyond the beachhead, Jenny had helped him walk away from the crowd and argued that the boys were too young to understand the prescience of what was happening, that they meant no disrespect. The soldier snapped back quickly however that a Second World War was something to be respected universally, regardless of age. 

3.

Turning his head for but a second to check the time again he found the children down below had disappeared from view. The void in the sand remained but even that was vanishing before his eyes as giant dewdrops splattered onto the window, distorting the outlook from the attic. The two quickly returned however through the view of indistinct condensation, with the small boy becoming magnified suddenly through an odd angle of refraction through glass and rain. The shower itself was growing relentless now, practically smothering the window into a thick fog. The soldier could make out little but it seemed the boys had returned carrying a small body between them. Two clearly defined legs lifelessly dangled between the young carriers. 

The soldier simply didn’t think in that moment. Didn’t dwell upon what they might be being buried, or why and indeed how they felt the beach behind he and his wife’s house was the apt place. He simply acted like his sergeant before had taught him to. Pounding the window once before him with a rare burst of energy, he cleared the view before him of condensation and muddying droplets. He had hoped to have the sound of the slam swallowed by the sea, but the boys clearly heard something and scurried away with their secret. The soldier waited, starting for a few seconds at the open grave and the waves behind gesturing forward. 

It seemed that the rain on the window however had led to misinterpretation; it was a dog they were carrying between them. Its tongue hung lifeless from its mouth; from high up he found it difficult to determine exactly what was wrong with it, but it was clearly dead. The two quickly returned kneeling down beside the hole and slowly lowered the animal into the beach. Rain had kicked up once more. The soldier suddenly felt angry and was about to ring for Jenny regardless of the hour. He stopped with the bell in his hand however when he noticed that they were saluting at the graveside. Their silhouettes cut out against the surf. The taller boy who he had at first believed to be but a head was clearly much disturbed by the whole event, staring straight down, gaze never from the void. The smaller child turned around and looked directly at the soldier for a few seconds without even realizing, the rain so driving now that he squinted when looking away. 

Dogs had grown rare around the town since the departing parade, most mothers preferring to keep the animals inside as surrogates for their departed sons than to allow them free to roam. With this in mind the soldier struggled to place the animal, perhaps it was the brother’s own rather than that they had killed it, or maybe they had merely discovered it in this condition and wished better for it than to merely be slumped in some passageway. The answers he would never really know, and oddly felt no real need to as he watched them fill the grave slowly with the shovels in hand. 

With the grave filled the two walked slowly towards the sea, just stopping as the waves lapped at their shoes. The rain was growing strong again, and the soldier lacked the energy to clear his view once more. Straining out past the precipitations he spotted the older brother placing his arm around the younger one until finally the rain obscured them indefinable from the crashing waves and the sodden beach.

She says this to herself, or to me.  I'm looking at the empty cage, all my enthusiasm for the search gone.
""Definitely."" She says again. Sighs and puts her head in her hands.
""My hands even smell like gerbil."" Her voice comes out muffled from between her fingers.
The cage is made of plastic. The top half clear, the bottom part hot pink. It is, or was, the home of Lisbeth - one of the more recent additions. It was my turn to pick a name so I went with a character from the book I was reading at the time.

Claire looks pained which surprises me. Lisbeth was her least favourite from the last litter, not that she'd admit that. Then I notice the empty pill packet in her hand.
""We're out?""
""We're out."" I thought so anyway, we've probably been out for a while. I have the beginnings of a headache which will only get worse, and my body feels exhausted although my mind is still whirring.

Perdidazine is our drug of choice at the moment. Cheap blue and off-white capsules that can be ordered online with no hassle. A stimulant - it took us a while to decide - with some hallucinogenic properties. The unpleasant effects: skull-splitting headaches accompanied by a whirring noise that comes from inside your head. I usually picture a chainsaw slicing into my brain during this. Claire sometimes gets heart palpitations. Short term memory loss too; which isn't unpleasant in itself but makes life a bit more complicated and disorganised. The positives include time speeding up and these long,  summer days with too much heat and too much boredom skipping by. Euphoria, which is always nice, and confidence. If we were ever inclined to leave the house while high, we'd be social chameleons, knowing just what to be and when to be it.
Claire's face is haunted now, and that's fuck all to do with our gerbils or lack of. I know I should be more concerned at how panicky she gets when we run out, but I'm too bored. Bored of looking for Lisbeth, bored of this headache, bored of Claire's complaining even before she's started. I need to be in my room for a while.

I spent most of the next day watching my ceiling from my bed, my duvet pulled over my shoulders. I lie down, roll onto my side and watch my fish swim about for a while. I have two, just standard goldfish. I don't really care about them but whenever they die I replace them and keep the names. I feed them and change their water regularly, but every few months they die anyway. I go back to watching the ceiling. The palm on my right hand is scratched, which I probably did in my sleep. It hurts. It's annoying.

Claire comes in for a while and talks at me. Asks me if I ordered more perd. I tell her to fuck off. She watches the fish for a while with me, or just stares at my wall through the tank, I don't know which. Eventually she goes away.

She wakes me up at seven in the morning. Her eyes are puffy from crying, which knocks me wide awake. I'm starting to worry she's getting really dependent on this new stuff. But it's Lisbeth she's upset about. I help her look again for almost two hours, mostly in the study: behind the computer, the bookshelf, we look in the garden too although we're certain we never left the back door open. We give up the search. Probably for good this time. After dumping more food in all the occupied cages we watch daytime television until I fall asleep on the sofa.

Sometime after waking up again I feel like writing in my diary which I haven't done for at least a month. It's in the middle of my bookcase, with my camcorder on top of it and a half smoked joint on top of that. I write in it for a while, updating it with my thoughts, feelings, activities, things it might be nice to remember at some point. Even Lisbeth gets a mention. I go to Claire's room and try to shake her awake but she's either been at Dad's diazepam or something else that she hasn't bothered to share with me - and won't be waking up for a while. I smoke the rest of the joint I found out of her window, poke a couple of her cuddly toys then leave. I find the camcorder cable in my desk and start recharging it. I'd assumed the battery was dead, and was right. I decide to film my fish swimming for a few hours because I'm not going to buy any more if they die on me again. I write 'Film them' on a piece of paper torn from a notepad and sellotape it to their tank.

I was woken up by the camcorder beeping. Means it's recharged. I go back to sleep.

When I get up none of my cereal is in the cereal cupboard which really annoys me. I have a cigarette in the garden and take one of two perd. capsules I have in my desk drawer  I ring dad who claims he bought it, then wake up Claire and ask her if she's eaten it, although I know she hates cereal. I wake her up again half an hour later and ask if she moved it to punish me for losing Lisbeth, or maybe for not finding her. She screams at me to fuck off. After a few minutes sat at the dining table I go and look in the same cupboard. It was next to the crunchy nut but at an angle that made it impossible to see. I pour myself a bowl, pour milk on, take one mouthful and realise I'm not even a bit hungry. I spit it out of the window.

When I go to feed my fish one of them is dead. She gets flushed down the toilet after I slightly mummify her in wet toilet paper to make sure she goes down properly. There's also a bit of scrap paper stuck on to the tank which says 'film them'. My handwriting. I rip it off and go tell Claire if she goes and buys me another goldfish I'll order more perdidazine. She agrees on the condition that I take pictures of the latest batch of gerbils and write up an advert on gumtree to sell them. Deal. I look for my phone but can't find it, and it goes straight to voicemail when I ring from the house phone. I think the camcorder can take stills anyway.

The camcorder belonged to dad before I asked for it. I found it in the cellar. I was bored at the time and was getting stoned every day, I wanted distractions. I found a lot of other junk too but it was the camcorder I wanted. I scanned through the tape in it, there was footage of me and Claire laughing and hitting a beach ball that was almost the same size as we were back and forth between us; as well as what looked like a party with a lot of old people sitting around in it. I recognised one or two. As I didn't think it was likely I could still get the tapes for it I asked dad if he minded me taping over it.
He didn't.

I type out the advert. Gerbils, four pounds each. Loving homes wanted, please no vivisectionists. Simple.
As I'm taking the camcorder downstairs I start to wonder how I'll get the photos online - the camcorder predates USB ports- but I'll deal with that later.  I want to see if there's anything left of the beach ball video first, I'm feeling a bit nostalgic. Nostalgia isn't my thing, but the drugs drag it to the surface.
After watching for a few minutes I turn it off, bring it to my room and dump it on my bookcase. The gerbils remain unphotographed.  I put on some Soundgarden and rifle through Dad's room for some of his diazepam or thorazine but it's been moved, or ran out, or otherwise gone.

I stay in my room for some time with one fish and a chainsaw headache.
Claire isn't in her room although her window's open. I throw the camcorder onto her bed with a note on it saying 'Watch this' I smoke a cigarette out of her window before deciding to pour out my last capsule and snort the contents. The last pill isn't in my desk though, which means I've probably already had that idea and already done it. It makes sense, as my headache's eased up. And things are okay. Not great, but not bad.

Halfway down the stairs i stop, confused as to why my mind's so clear. I assume I've taken some perdidazine - a drug me and Claire have been taking. It causes some problems with memories. And I can't remember why I'm going down the stairs. I want to talk to Claire. I want to swop neuroses with her, have a deep conversation about whatever, whatever she wants, if we had a beach ball we could go in the garden and play volleyball with it, or something. Anything she wants to do really. But she isn't in her room, although the window's open. My camcorder is on her bed with a note attached. I take it back to my room and put it on my bookshelf where it belongs.

My room. The camcorder is on my lap. On my desk, the laptop is still open, halfway through typing that gerbil advert. My fish (plural) are swimming around the tank (thanks Claire) my chainsaw headache is revving, revving. Claire is next to me, watching the camcorder with me.
The room full of old people are laughing, sitting in our living room, but with different chairs. They're boring, and I'm about to fast foward when it begins and the view changes to a lopsided view of my bed, desk, and fish tank - a bookcases-eye-view. My voice can be heard from outside in the hall, muffled. It's my second time watching this and Claire's first but honestly, my recollection is hazy. It's mostly new to us both.

On the screen I walk in holding Lisbeth the gerbil by the base of her tail. I see myself look just to the left of the lens, and my eyes are blank, empty. Although I couldn't say what it is, some feature of my eyes are lost. Especially compared with Lisbeth's which are very much alive, big, black, and frightened. her paws are flapping at nothing, there's nothing to cling onto for her. We watch me make a fist around her, open the aquarium lid with my other hand and plunge her in. In the now Claire has started to scream at me, things like what the fuck am I doing and what the fuck am I showing her. A lot of 'fucks'.

I tell her to shut up but she doesn't until she appears on screen and I grab her face and twist her at the screen so she sees herself. On screen, I don't look up, I'm just staring at my submerged fist -and I guess those were gerbil bites and scratches on my hand- and Claire doesn't look at me while I drown Lisbeth, but she plunges in her own arm, coiled around mine like a snake, and puts her hand over my closed fist.

One or both of us is squeezing. Because red ribbons of blood are starting to trail upwards from between our fingers. She puts her other hand on my waist and slowly moves it up and down, under my t shirt, stroking, in a way few people have touched me and in a way my sister never has. We're both grinning now, but the smiles seem painted on. It's not something that feels real. I can't see our eyes, but I know how blank and devoid of anything they are, I just know. More crimson streams waft out of our interlocked hands, and the fish swim strictly in the corner of their tank, well away from us.

At this point Claire runs from the room. I watch for another few minutes before turning it off.
I knock on her door but she just starts to scream at me again. I shout over her that we need more perd. and she gets louder, screaming 'fuck you' over and over but eventually quietens down and soon after slides Dad's debit card under the door.

I listen to Pearl Jam's Lost Dogs with the volume quite low so I can hear if the letterbox is rattled and when it is, me and Claire are both at the door in seconds. She rips open the small brown package with her teeth, same with the plastic wrapper and tips the capsules into her hand. She starts dividing them into two piles in her palm.
""Maybe in an hour or two we could look for Lisbeth again, if you want.""I say.
She pauses, then gets back to rationing. One for you, one for me.
""Maybe try the study again?"" She stops again.
""And we could change her bedding so it's nice for her when we find her."" She does look up at me this time, with an expression like gratitude.
I think she's going to hug me but her hands are full of pills and packaging. So she doesn't.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_16g21q,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/16g21q/missing_things_dark_2300_words/,

""My Day called Regrets""

The year is 2013, and I have made bad deciesions in my past and it is time to get everything straightened out. 

It is a cold winters day, and I fight to open my eyes to the sunlight because it is another day of feeling the way I always do. The windows do not hold the cold out and it blows in under my blanket and lets me know I feel still. I let out a Sigh... and I wish things were different... but they aren't. I hurt people and destroyed futures. These things go through my mind every other thought durning my time of being awake. When I fall to sleep I am awoken by a racing heart beat and fear of not knowing how to fix things I thought I could. 

As I wonder why I still get up, I make my way to the hoodie laying next to me. It is thick and is the only thing showing warmth to me in this time of cold. My day is filled with pain and trying to not tear up at every though of my past. I get ready for work like everyone else. I am listening to music where the screaming is ecspressing my inner voice and hurt from ex-girlfriends and past lovers who are now a distant memory of the singers past life. I feel his pain and wish everything was better. 

I gather my things and head off to my third shift factory job and get ready for another slow night of work knowing the only things my mind will be thinking of are the things I wish it didn't. I put on a show for my co-workers, smiling... laughing... but the few people who know my pain know I am crying inside. I turn away more often then normal to wipe away the few forceful tears that leave my eyes. With everything going on I pretend to chuckle at the poorly told joke told to mee to try and cheer me up. It does not work and I just look away and get back to my work. Trying to focus on the job at hand and keeping as busy as I can to repress the ideas and memories. The night rolls on and everything at work is moving at a slugish pace and I have done all I can to keep busy, so I stand. I stand and just look out into nothingness, thinking, feeling pain I wish I have never felt. 

The time is 5am and it is almost time to get done with work. The thought of sleep seems so good, but the dreams to come will keep me up. I shuffle to my locker looking at only where I need to walk not paying attention to the things around me, people, and machines. I kick off my boots knowing that the day is done and I can try and relax. Relaxation is just a distant memory I have not felt in a long time. It hurts. Everytihng hurts. I hate my job and the place I live. But I can not just leave and walk away. My gloves and heavy jacket help me get past the cold winter morning as I walk to my car. 

The worst part of going home is knowing the heat from my ex lover is no longer there, and it is filled with the cold and emptieness of my bed. I try to keep warm by holding a pillow as close as possible. It does not help and only makes me feel worse. I hate this. But I need to work on myself before I can even think about looking for someone to try and feel happy with. It will contiune to be cold. I lay cold and alone waiting for my eyes to get heavy. The sand man must be stuck in traffic because my eyes will not get tierd and my pain will not subside. The tears help pull me towards sleep and I know it is another day that I will try to forget. This is just my day called regrets, and I am gone to wake again and repeat it.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_162put,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/162put/my_day_called_regrets_rough_draft/,
1357493309.0,3,self.shortstories,162g1r,Story I wrote in school: Splitting Wood. Tell me what you think. Enjoy. ,toteskrotzkrotz,5,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/162g1r/story_i_wrote_in_school_splitting_wood_tell_me/,"An autumn tapestry lies before me. I approach this landscape of fading greens, subtle reds, and overbearing yellows. The ground squelches as my boots break the surface of the mud; it's still very much in the transition of solidifying after the late summer rain. The wind twists around the semi-dormant maples and stretches like elastic as it weaves through the dense wall of ash trees. What's left of the breeze binds itself around me and holds on. 
	Rays of glistening sunlight peek through the cloak of powdery overcast. There's no happy medium of temperature; heat exists in the light, goosebumps in the shade. My path, pitted and trampled from years of use, follows along edge of a strong string of intersecting pines. At a point where the pines meet the path, an opening is made. The path continues past the aperture into a wide pasturage littered with goldenrod and burdock. The breeze picks up the goldenrod pollen and sends it dancing, twirling, twisting, and then off into the world. 
	The path continues along, winding and weaving through the sea of soon-to-be hay, until it finally stops near a pile of long-dead logs. The logs were cut a few years back by my grandfather, but that’s as much as I know about them. I was back here last week, so the wood splitter is still here, but I didn't get much done. I have a problem with paying attention to what I'm doing. I'd like to say that it's nature's fault for being so damn beautiful, but I don't feel that way. I would just rather be somewhere else, although, I do like staring vacantly at the sky. Ever changing clouds distract me as they perform their celestial puppet shows. Above me, a quick nimbus fox jumps over the mammatus of the lazy dog. As the wind blows, the clouds dance and move; their movements close to identical, yet not. The more they’re pushed and pulled by the winds above, the more they morph. The quick fox changes to an anamorphic slug, slowly streaking across the sky. 
	A nearby branch begins to shake, I give it no notice at first, but as the trembling continues, my attention is drawn. The rustling persists until a dry, crispy, brown leaf falls from branch, revealing a bluejay. The bird’s crested head tilts as it stares at me; we both stand motionless, staring at each other and waiting for the other’s reaction. His beaded eyes begin to widen and narrow and his talons wrap around the thin maple branch. A sudden flap of his sky blue wings sends the garrulous bird flying into the cold air and beyond.
	I turn back to my chore. The wood’s already cut into identical logs, although they still need to be split. I look down at the several colorful shades of brown and gray. Each strain has different qualities. Ash is easy to carry to the splitter, but maple is heavy and takes multiple attempts to lift. I tire pretty quickly the more wood I split. The warm air expelled from my lungs permeates the cold, creating a mass of haze that fogs my glasses. 
	The wood screeches and cries as it’s forcibly divided, fiber by fiber, until it relents and splits apart. Some wood cries differently, their fibers held together tighter than others. The splitter snaps them regardless, only pausing momentarily while I provide it with more. Each piece is harder than the last. My muscles stretch with each lift, leaving them exhausted and drained. The sun position, directly above me, tells me it’s time for a well deserved break. 
	I sit my weary body on top a fallen poplar, and unpack the lunch I carried. A small bunch of magnolia warblers fly by, their bumble bee-like bellies bouncing along the wind currents. Their melodies, comparable to a Mozartian piece, flutter down from the heavenly scene of altocumulus overcast. Ruby-throated hummingbirds weave their way in between the flying group of warblers, their wings flittering at magnificent speeds. I look in awe while chewing my slightly stale tuna fish sandwich. The moment the birds make their way behind the tall pines, and out of my sight, I finish it and walk back.
	The rather large pile of logs that once lay next to the splitter is gone and in its place are small remnants. The final cry of cracking wood echoes through the dense forest, proceeded by the near silent sound of sighing. Leaving the finished job behind, I make my way back. The path once again takes me through the gap of pines, the squelching sod, and the weaving winds. The rays that once cut through the clouds, now tries to make its way past the trees as its source begins to set. As the sun’s stream of shine loosens its grip on the land, the temperature drops. The once-subtle amount of fog left by my breath looks like smoke. I childishly hold my fingers up to my mouth and blow the smoke left in my lungs from my imaginary cigarette. 
	I give a momentary glance back at where I’ve been. The walls of autumn-colored trees, the boot tracks in the mud, and the pile of perfectly split wood are all behind me.

His well-tailored suit, pristine shoes and immaculately coiffured hair gave the impression of success. The buildings on either side of the road loomed over him, their iron-shuttered shopfronts grinning at the man as he strode ever onward.  His colleagues called him arrogant, his CV talked of a “driven and determined personality”. He was Lucius Green, millionaire banker, tax avoider, and owner of the 3rd largest collection of Lamborghinis in the world. He didn’t like this part of town, he thought, as he zipped up his designer coat and looked warily over his shoulder.

“Save yourself!, for the day of the brother is almost upon us!”

A crazed and bedraggled old man shuffled up to Lucius, his eyes darting around inside his head like ants in a Petri dish. He was wearing nothing more than rags.

“Pardon?” Lucius answered, maintaining politeness while trying hard not to spit in the old fool’s face. He didn’t have time for this.

“The alignment has begun! Those in rags shall be saved, kings shall be overthrown! The riches of nations will turn to ruin! There will be no greater day than the day of the brother!”

The man began to shriek, flecks of phlegm hitting Lucius’ priceless clothing. “heed my words!” he screamed. Spooked, the banker began to run. He hailed a taxi and was back in the leafy womb of Knightsbridge, or “civilization” as he called it, in no time.

Lucius woke up and lazily pawed through his smartphone’s news app.  It was the usual mix of tragedy in the Middle East and governmental incompetence at home. But something caught his eye.

“Reports are surfacing that the King of Tonga, Tupou VI, has been deposed and killed at his extravagant palace by a mob of dissidents. Their motive remains unknown.”

*Kings shall be overthrown…*

A coincidence, surely. Lucius put down his phone and rolled out of bed. Another long day of making millions in the City awaited him, and all of it would go straight to his offshore account in…

“Tonga…” he said aloud.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

Another coincidence, surely. 

Lucius strolled through the marble and glass hallways of his building, and was at his desk in seconds. He checked his email, informing him of his ever-larger bank balance.

Life was good. 

Until the phone rang.

“Mr Green, I am calling from Brother Capital. It seems that due to the unforeseen circumstances in Tonga, your account has been frozen, and therefore you will not be able to use any of your assets”

The man down the line had a grey, monotonous voice. He was not someone to start an argument with.

Lucius slowly put down the phone.

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin….*

Did the old man have a point?

Brother Capital…

“Don’t be such a bloody fool!” Lucius barked at himself. Today was one of those days better spent on the deck of your yacht.

He was just unlucky that his account got frozen because of some political unrest in some unfathomably hot corner of the world… was he? He shook his head and turned on Bloomberg.

The colour red hit him first. Red arrows, pointing down, all across the bottom of the screen. His eyes widened in disbelief. The news anchor was frantic, trying to keep up with collapsing stocks across the world. NASDAQ, FTSE, DAX… all plummeting. 

A single bead of sweat rolled down Lucius’ face. This was terminal. He had £60 million invested across the world, he was never going to get it all back… 

Was there a way out?

*Those in rags shall be saved…*

*The riches of nations will turn to ruin…*

“He was right!”  “He was right!” Lucius sprinted out of the room, knocking two interns out of the way with frantic force. He spilled out of the building and onto the road, still screaming at the top of his lungs. He tore at his Ralph Lauren shirt and proclaimed to the sky:

“Save yourself! For the day of the brother is upon us!”

He was at once accosted by an angry taxi driver.

“You don’t understand! You’ll never understand!, It’s all over! The day is upon us!”

The ragged banker turned, and sprinted down an alleyway.

I see the girl I once loved, but now she is a cold, heartless monster. Where in our own world, our made up world. I see our house, its slowly fading away. I lay on our couch crying from the pain she give me. I watch her as she packs up her bags and leave. Our children run over to me crying asking, ""Where's mommy going?"", ""Why is she leaving?"" I answer them with, “She no longer loves us kids.” They run to her asking her to stay but she shakes her head ‘no’ and begins to leave. That’s when it happens.

The world that I and she made begins to fade away I see the walls disappearing.  I hold my children in my arms saying, “Please not Sebastian and Estella. Anything but my children.” I hold them as tight to me as I say, “It’s going to be all right, don’t worry daddy is going to fix this.” I begin to cry even more knowing there’s nothing I can do to stop this. Our world is nearly gone all that’s left is the house, already half of the house is gone, the area around us is starting to fade. I kiss my children as they begin to fade, the whole time I’m staring into her eyes, she only sheds a tear as our children disappear. When I no longer feel them I feel another wave of tears wash over me as I get up in a rage yelling, “You heartless bastard how could you? Our kids are gone because of you!! All because it became to challenging for you??” I back away, lying down in pain tracing circles in the ground. I’m just there in the darkness and pain.

She then dries up her tear and leaves threw the door as I hold the only remaining evidence of what I use to have. The photo is the best one of my no longer family. I cry deeply tracing the images of my family. Sebastian is the first to start fading; I start to cry even more as I lose memory of him, my only son. Next is my baby girl Estella, another wave of tears as the memory of her is gone from my mind. Then is the girl I had let in, my wife. I don’t recall the feelings as she began to fade all I could remember was when she was mine. The photo now contains just me I cry as I try to remember my family but can’t.  I scream out in pain and agony, “YOU HEARTLESS MONSTER!!!!!” I then fall back down and lay there as I try to remember my family, all I can recall is the feelings I thought I had for…..her. The door she left in disappears as well. I just lay there, a shell of the man I once was.

I worked for a frieghter company called Lightspeed. They ship anything, from produce to livestock, from planet to planet. I was one of those stiff's who worked in the loading dock, drivin' a hoverlift; loadin' the pallet's and other cargo into the transport ship's. Not my job of choice, but it paid the bill's.

The only ray's of sunshine in my life were my Wife and our Son... Those are good memories. My wife Lana, a five foot seven, one hundred and five pound knockout. Her hair's long and flowin' red, eye's as blue as ice and her lip's are beautifully full and alive. She was my one true love. Then my son, John was born and suddenly I had two great loves in my life. The last time I saw him he was eleven. Like me, he was not an athlete, but a thinker. A good strong jaw, and developing those ruggedly good look's like his old man. He'll have to beat the girl's off with a stick.

Hopefully he'll take my advice and wait till he's grown up and spent some time for himself travelin' and explorin' before he start's the dating game.

Listen to me. I'm dronin' on and on, sorry. I like to revel in the good memories as much as I can, but if you'll stick around I'm sure my story will entertain you.

What was the tragic twist of fate that ruined my life? It was a year ago, as far as I can tell. One day, down on the loadin' dock, I was finishin' up loadin' a ship with produce. Much to my surprise Lana and John stopped by for a surprise visit. Out of the shadow's of another ship, a Terian stowaway emerge's and hold's my wife up at gun point in full view of me. Big mistake!

Wavin' that gun at my family. Terians aren't the brightess bunch in the galaxy. Ugly, worty creatures that look like a frog and fish combined into humanoid form. Three finger's including the thumb, and webbed feet. Every time I think of them I see that one, and I'd gladly kill him again, to protect my family.

That's right. I killed him. When I saw him and his gun, my vision of the world turned to red, and the next thing I know I come back to myself; a lifeless Terian gripped firmly by the throat in my hand's. A bullet wound in my arm, and a life shattered.

The case was open and shut in no time. My sentence a lifetime banishment to the horrible planet known as Torment.

Torment... That's a fitting name for this place. When it's day time the temperature reaches the hundreds, and even though it's constantly bright, there's no visible sun ever! The light permeates everywhere. There's no escaping it. It penetrates even into the caves and through the depth's of the local flora. It's as bright as the sun in all directions. No shadows are cast and no shade is made. Until night, escape from the light is impossible. Then the night is the same extreme. No visible moon or starlight. 

Don't ask me how, it just work's that way here. Even with  a flashlight you barely can see what's directly in front of you, up to a foot. The temperature drop's to the negative's and a fire barely bring's comfort what with casting any light and warmth with in a one foot radius.

The planet is sandy, yet abundent with plant and animal life. The tree's grow thin at the bottom and get thicker at the top. The bushes constantly shift and move and all the animal's are vicious and blind. I don't mean that they can't see due to poor eye's. I mean that they have no eye's at all. What they lack in sight they make up for in hearing, though.

The only thing that's helped me to stay sane, is my faith in Jesus and the Lord. They give me the strength to carry on. In a place like Torment, strength is what one need's.

Another blistering day on torment. Today, like any other day I started by leaving my camp, and going to the water hole. The water is red, bubbling and has a hint of vanilla. Oddly the water is as cold as ice, even though it bubbles. Now if I only cared for vanilla, yuck.

The other day I spotted a Leeug. That's a creature about the size of a lion, that look's like a leech in color, smoothness and mouth, but it crawl's like a slug. Even worse it has four tentacle arm's with claw's on each end. It was disturbingly close yesterday, so I'm obviously a little on edge today.

It's a little suspicious to me that I even spotted it, since they have the ability to perfectly blend in with their surroundings. Why would it be out in the open?

Now that I think about it I wonder why, on a planet inhabited with eyeless creatures, would a species be able to blend in with it's surrounding's? Hopefully I never find out.

Anyway I went for a swim and let down my guard as I began to relax. Idiot. When I came out of the water I caught a glimmer of a silhouette, near my clothes. Since I'm a convict I don't have the luxury of a gun. The wood on this planet is fragile so I can't fashion a weapon out of it. So I was left with nothing else but my own two hand's for defense. 

I rushed the creature (a Leeug it turned out to be) and in it's shocked state I connected with a right. Then a left. It tried to bite my hand, but I dodged in time. Unfortunately my dodge positioned me for the worst. 

Just as I caught my balance, it happened. It's claw's sank into the orbit's of my skull, and with one quick jerk my eye's came out amidst the sounds of the ripping flesh and muscle. I don't have to worry about the light anymore.

I now know that the Leeug has a numbing poison on it's claw's, meant to help it disable it's prey. It was keeping me from feeling my torn out eye's, and if I'd have been sliced any more it would have disabled me completely.

In the absence of pain my body surged out adrenaline and I used it to wrestle one of the Leeug's claws into my hand, and stab it to death with it's own weapon. In my stabbing I ripped the claw free from the creature, and kept going until I had it underneath me, and until I could feel the solid thump of stabbing terrain beneath it.

After my victory I crawled towards the sound of the bubbling water, and washed the gore off of me, and tended to disinfecting my eye's. I turned my shirt into a bandage and wrapped my eye's up to help stop the bleeding.

Feeling slightly dizzy I placed the Leeug claw in my rear pocket, and stumbbled towards my camp. As best as I could figure. 

After an hour I began to worry. I had walked from the water hole to my camp at night many times. Half of the time I did it without a flash light, and it didn't take this long. Maybe I went the wrong direction, since I was dizzy from the blood loss. Just as I started to panic, I came to a tree and found the arrow I carved into it to help me along my path at night. I also numbered them, and this one was number three. I was close!

Then I heard it. Several grunt's in different directions. The Leeug's were upon me. I guess they travel in pack's and the one I killed was just the tip of the iceberg.

I drew the claw from my pocket and began slashing in the air wildly in all directions. I knew that my effort's were in vain. I was no doubt doomed!

My name is Lana Gillmore. My husband Jake saved me and our son John over a year ago from a Terian mugger. 

In the confusion of the fight the mugger shot himself, and my poor husband collapsed. unable to grasp what had happened, his mind shut his body down and threw him into a state of mental torment.

Even now, viewing him through the window of his room at the Serene Winds Insane Asylum, he lay on his side staring into oblivion, muttering to himself in unintelligible whispers. He wear's a straight-jacket and requires constant care. Maybe somday he'll come to term's with what happened.

Maybe someday.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""There are rooms here,"" I say ""but they are not for rent, they are for the pilgrims."" I pick up his pack and start to walk down the hall.

All of the rooms are small and they have two bunked beds. I will let him choose his own when he decides to stay so I set his bag down. ""Cafe?""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Uh, yes please, thank you."" He says. I gesture down the hall towards the kitchen and we walk. He does not say anything so I put the kettle on to boil.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Please sit, it is getting late and other pilgrims will be coming soon, excuse me. I walk to the front hall and open the door and turn on the light. They will know to come inside to sleep and to eat and prepare for tomorrow.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""The water is boiling."" He calls to me from the kitchen.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Then take it off."" I say to him as I walk back into the kitchen. ""Do not burn your hand. the handle get quite hot."" but it is too late, he drops the kettle spilling the hot water on the ground. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Ow, I'm so sorry."" he says.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""It is no trouble, now I will have clean floors."" I smile at him. ""Please, run your hand under the tap."" I say getting a dishrag from the drawer I bend down to wipe away the water.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""No please,"" he says, ""let me."" taking the rag from my hands and a knee.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""That is why you are here, and that is why you are a pilgrim."" I say.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Excuse me?"" he says looking up at me.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""I am now a very old man, and I have seen many pilgrims. You are hurt but you will not tend to yourself.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""It's not that bad."" he says, continuing to wipe the floor. the rag and his hands and the water are steaming.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Oh nieto, I understand. This is why you walk alone on this path. There are those who would walk with you but you think you must be alone."" I say, putting a hand on his shoulder. ""Now go put your hand under cool water."" He stands. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""It's late, I don't think I should have any coffee."" he says wringing out the rag. He hangs it over the edge of the sink. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Yes, better to turn in, the way is still long for you, for all of us."" I say. ""I will see you in the morning and then we will have cafe."" He turns to leave, ""goodnight pilgrim.""

The woman apologized and explained, ""We didn't have this green thing back in my earlier days.""
The young clerk responded, ""That's our problem today. Your generation did not care enough to save our environment f or future generations.""
She was right -- our generation didn't have the green thing in its day.
Back then, we returned milk bottles, soda bottles and beer bottles to the store. The store sent them back to the plant to be washed and sterilized and refilled, so it could use the same bottles over and over. So they really were truely recycled.
But we didn't have the green thing back in our day.
Grocery stores bagged our groceries in brown paper bags, that we reused for numerous things, most memorable besides household garbage bags, was the use of brown paper bags as book covers for our schoolbooks. This was to ensure that public property, (the books provided for our use by the school) was not defaced by our scribblings. Then we were able to personalize our books on the brown paper bags.
But too bad we didn't do the green thing back then.
We walked up stairs, because we didn't have an escalator in every store and office building. We walked to the grocery store and didn't climb into a 300-horsepower machine every time we had to go two blocks.
But she was right. We didn't have the green thing in our day.
Back then, we washed the baby's diapers because we didn't have the throwaway kind. We dried clothes on a line, not in an energy-gobbling machine burning up 220 volts -- wind and solar power really did dry our clothes back in our early days. Kids got hand-me-down clothes from their brothers or sisters, not always brand-new clothing.
But that young lady is right; we didn't have the green thing back in our day.
Back then, we had one TV, or radio, in the house -- not a TV in every room. And the TV had a small screen the size of a handkerchief (remember them?), not a screen the size of the state of Montana. In the kitchen, we blended and stirred by hand because we didn't have electric machines to do everything for us. When we packaged a fragile item to send in the mail, we used wadded up old newspapers to cushion it, not Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap. Back then, we didn't fire up an engine and burn gasoline just to cut the lawn. We used a push mower that ran on human power. We exercised by working so we didn't need to go to a health club to run on treadmills that operate on electricity.
But she's right; we didn't have the green thing back then.
We drank from a fountain when we were thirsty instead of using a cup or a plastic bottle every time we had a drink of water. We refilled writing pens with ink instead of buying a new pen, and we replaced the razor blades in a razor instead of throwing away the whole razor just because the blade got dull.
But we didn't have the green thing back then.
Back then, people took the streetcar or a bus and kids rode their bikes to school or walked instead of turning their moms into a 24-hour taxi service. We had one electrical outlet in a room, not an entire bank of sockets to power a dozen appliances. And we didn't need a computerized gadget to receive a signal beamed from satellites 23,000 miles out in space in order to find the nearest burger joint.
But isn't it sad the current generation laments how wasteful we old folks were just because we didn't have the green thing back then?

	“Dude,” Gitch yelled. “Wake up.” Body slamming a sleeping Cameron seemed the only way to wake him up at the cottage; he could sleep for hours into the late afternoon if he chose to. Cameron slowly woke up, hearing the loud noises in the busy hallway now he was awake and his door was open. “Breakfast time,” They were cousins, and best friends, and only Gitch’s persistence and energy could make him get out of bed by shaking him, Gitch was an early riser, always at seven. “C’mon, grandma made eggs and hash browns, and it’s the Regatta today!” making Cameron’s headshake, he finally began to move, not wincing anymore. Slightly shorter, thicker and darker than the lanky, sticky and blonder Gitch, Cameron sat for a second on the end before getting up off his bed, not changing out of yesterday’s bathing suit, they all didn’t.
	
Gitch led the way through the hallway, which was the busiest place in the morning. Twin uncle’s Sandy and Frank were putting down the last of the new tiles quietly and in sync, and Gitch’s younger brother Brett was running around them, bumping and falling constantly but never crying. Tall and skinny Dillon was replacing the batteries in the smoke detector as the graying cloud thickened around him, “We’ll kick ass today, yaw?”, smacked his two cousins in the shoulder and laughed as he pointed into the washroom. Nikki, the half Indian cousin but still retaining the same smile they all had, was patting Sam on the back as she cried with her newly discovered makeup running down her face sitting on the toilet about her boyfriend of two weeks who had broken up with her.

“Its ok, Sam, he doesn’t deserve you anyways, besides,” Nikki said sighing, Sam looked up at her. “Relax, you’re only 13.” The words seemed to hit Sam with such power that she stood defiantly and looked at her younger cousin’s in the face, suddenly not in tears.

“I’m going to get chocolate.” Swinging her hair around and strutting, she pushed through the two boys in the door.

“Hey,” Cameron shouted at her back, “Can you get me some?”

“I’m not coming back! You just don’t understand!” Running up the stairs, Sam slammed her door and began to loudly weep.

“OY!” Plates being set on the table could be heard from the washroom and hall, “Breakfast! C’mon kids!” Grandma yelled from the kitchen. Rubbing her temples and exhaling, Nikki herself stormed past the boys, who looked at each other confused at what had just happen, and went to the kitchen, but they didn’t see Dillon on the way.


The red walled kitchen was soon filled. A brown table was covered in platters of pancakes, breakfast sausages, toast and cereals and it smelt like coffee and cigarettes. Grandma, holding a mug and puffing away, always poured Brett, the youngest, juice first and then started throwing food onto all the kid’s plates. They all chewed hungrily as their grandma, who was beautiful and a model once, stood leaning tiredly on the counter, watching her grandchildren.

“AHHH!” Schrieking as Dillon came running into the kitchen, she hid behind the kids. “GET THAT OUT OF HERE!”

“Why?” Dillon reached into the bucket he ran in with, and pulled out a small frog, grandma was afraid of them. He closed in on her, all the cousins cheering him on.
“Just give it a little touch!” Running and chasing her, grandma reeled out of the kitchen, screaming her way to the living room. The table erupted in laughter as all the kids looked into the bucket to see what Dillon had caught.

There was always competition to that could get the best catch of critter at the cottage. Dillon, being the oldest and skilled, usually won, catching lizards, frogs, giant fish, even squirrels. The real winner was who could scare their grandma the most; she was scared of most critters, she never got too angry though. Pulling out a white toad, the cousins sang their “ouuuh’s” and “ahh’s” together. They all become excited when it came to catching critters and at their cottage their grandpa had built to be off the grids.

The cottage was the favorite place when anyone went up. When grandpa was building it, dynamite was used to blow holes in the surrounding rocks to make a level surface to build on. That was his thing; he was always making things around the cottage better, cooler, more ridiculous. He did always say it was his true passion, his cottage more extravagant than any of the family’s houses. Without saying much he just wanted the cottage to be a paradise, and it really was to those who visited.
 
	The actually cottage was at the very end of the very last road. On a five-acre square property in the corner of the lake. Inside was just a giant living room and a high ceiling with a moonlight cluttered with comfy couches, tables, games and TVs.  The kitchen is too small and bright for such a big family, and the rest of the rooms are simple bedrooms and bathrooms. He added windmills, solar panels and water filters, it even had it’s own waste treatment process underground. The garden wasn’t used to grow food but large flowers, but it could grow enough vegetables to live on. All the sliding doors including the kitchen’s go to the patio with the giant barbeque that overlooks the entire lake and is right smack in front of the orange and purple sunset in the summer. The boat is raised on the dock and the dock goes 30 feet into the water, with a diving board on the end. To the right is a white-sanded beach with a trampoline and a homemade jungle gym with its own slide, monkey bars and jump platform, and a whole section of beach is roped off for volleyball. Where the cars parked doubled, as a field for bacci, soccer and Frisbee, and everywhere you look are old trees, staring back. The swamp part of the lake is in front of the beach and is shallow for 200 feet out, with trails of rock which leave you knee high in water to walk through the swamp and catch the critters, endlessly detailed with nooks of rock and natural crevices of raised dirt and fallen trees, it’s weird how that’s the warmest part of the lake. But to the kid’s it was just their favorite place to go during the summer, to explore and have fun; their grandpa had already signed it off to them, to be shared when they all turned to adults.

After Dillon had convinced grandma that it was safe to come back the kitchen and given Cameron the frog, she rushed everyone out, making the children go outside. “It’s too nice a day to be inside.” Gitch and Cameron agreed, going outside together first.

“Phew,” Gitch winced at the sun, “It sure is hot outside.” The sky was clear and the sun was beating down on the patio, where most of the family was. Dragonflies hummed around, large enough to eat, the cat was driving himself crazy running around the brown wooden patio, just not fast enough to snatch one. They headed quickly together to the beach, going down the old concrete steps with moss on them.
“We should practice for today!” Grabbing two nearby bamboo nets, Gitch threw Cameron one.

They ran together towards the swamp, laughing loudly, following the familiar path. Cameron was slower but because he had a bucket with the white toad in it. Finding a nice rock, they scared off the frogs and left the toad sitting confused in his new home.
“Frogs are too hard to catch this year,” Gitch said as he stumbled and splashed, his net coming up empty. “They’re too small and quick!” Frustrated, he swiped at a frog, only to have it jump away at the last second. The water around them became dirty and they, shirtless, moved on, becoming focused on the animals around them under the shining sun.
*	* 	*	*	*
“Boys!” Dillon yelled, tilting his sailor hat, starting the boat. “Let’s go! Regatta time!” Revving the engine, he checked the stats.
“Dillon!” Laughing together, Cameron and Gitch came towards the dock, both holding the bucket, staring into it. “Look what we got!” Sloshing the bucket towards Dillon, he barely looked into it.
“C’mon let’s go!” He said sighing. “We’re going to be late! And then you cant-“
“Ok, ok, sheesh.” Gitch said as he dumped the snake and fish they had caught, jumping into the boat with Cameron.
The boys sat in the front, and their long matching hair whipped around them as Dillon cut through the lake, towards another, smaller cottage, which had dozens of boats surrounding it. Slowing down, Cameron and Gitch noticed it was mostly teenagers, like Dillon, being loud and running around each other.
“Listen,” Dillon spoke softly, he never did that. “You two are here for the critter catching, we have to beat everyone else, and winner gets a free case of beer.”  	
Looking up at the beach, Dillon seemed focused on one spot. He was staring a girl in a red bikini, who was obviously too old for him and dancing with the older boys.
“CINDY!?” Gitch yelled, throwing his arms in her direction. “You want the beer for –“
“SHH!” Smacking Gitch on the arm, Dillon looked around to see if anyone had noticed. “Alright,” he said sighing and shutting off the boat. “Let’s go get this.”
Walking behind their older cousin, Cameron and Gitch stuck together, feeling out of place. The cottage without a beach was filled with teenagers, all half-dressed and stumbling. Music they weren’t allowed to listen to was blasting, and bodies thrust into each other.
They lost Dillon for a while and ended up next to the porta potties, watching young adults stumble over themselves. Finally, after they got restless, Dillon came staggering towards them.
“All right, alright, listen-“ Dillon put a hand on both of their heads, and looked around, probably for Cindy.
 “EVERYONE!” A fat teenager stepped on a barrel, and the music cut out. It was obviously his cottage, because no one made a sound. “Alright,” he said, looking around. “Welcome to this year’s Regatta Bash!” Cheers erupted and people jumped up and down. Waving his hands, the crowd settled again. “There’s three competitions this year,” Holding silence for effect. “Flip cup, wakeboarding, and critter catching.” Cameron and Gitch grinned at eachother, knowing why Dillon had brought them there. He was notoriously good at flip cup, but needed the boys to really win the competition. 
“Ok,” Dillon came in-between them, whispering his beer breathe. “You guys, have, I mean have to catch something. There’s only sex, I mean six others in your competition.” Standing to his full height, he clapped both boys on their shoulders. “Do me proud cuzzies.” And he walked off, surprisingly straight, to the flip cup table.
“Anyone who’s catching stuff,” The fat boy yelled at anyone who was paying attention but losing his steam. “You have one hour! GO! Flip cup over by me!”
Cameron and Gitch sped off, not knowing where they were going. The cottage they were at was more heavily forested, and they headed towards the water, dirty as it was. Formulating a plan, they decided to walk down the coast, to find a nook where they could hopefully find a turtle or snake. Making no progress for the first twenty minutes, not even spotting a fish, they became worried.
“This sucks!” Cameron threw his net into the water and huffed towards the short to sit down. “There’s nothing to catch, Dillon’s going to pissed,-“
“Don’t move.” Gitch interrupted. He raised a finger to his lips and pointed with his net to behind Cameron. Without moving, he turned his head.
There, right behind Cameron’s foot, was the biggest frog either of them had ever seen. A foot across, solid green, it’s eyes looked like ping-pong balls. It hadn’t moved but it was so big they could see it breathing.
“Dude,” Cameron whispered, “Don’t miss.” He handed Gitch the bucket and nodded.
It was easier then they thought possible, the frog didn’t even move; just let itself be squished into this bucket, taking up almost half of it. It’s ribbit sounded like a trumpet.
“THIS IS INSANE!” Gitch yelled, looking down at the frog. “We’ll forsure win!” They brought the frog bucket back to the party, where they spotted Dillon throwing down a red cup and yelling.
“YEAAHHHHHH!” Dillon screamed as he spotted his two cousins, running towards them. He face planted, and pulled himself up, smiling with a mouth full of dirt. “Guys, thanks! This, this, this is ridiculous!” He looked into the bucket. “That’s gotta be, Cindy!” Turning his head violently, he gestured for her to come, and she sloppily made her way towards them.
“Wow,” She said and looked at Dillon coyly. “Guess you were right about your cousins.” But she wasn’t paying them any attention, rubbing Dillon’s back. They had never seen their older cousin look happier or redder in the face, but maybe it was because of the beer.
*	*	*	*	*
With Cindy in his lap and looking very pleased with himself, Dillon started the boat, winking at his cousins. Petting the beer while Cameron and Gitch looked at the frog, the ride back was pretty peaceful, with the sun going down on their backs, their cottage glowed.
Approaching the cottage, Cameron and Gitch noticed they were going too fast. Looking nervously at Dillon, who seemed too caught up with Cindy, they started yelling, but their voices were lost in the wind.
“DIllON!” Gitch yelled in his ear, and finally he pushed Cindy off of him, pulling the throttle back. Except they didn’t slow down enough, and they were headed right for the dock. The boat approached the dock quickly, and they all screamed together, but it bounced off the wood, only throwing their heads forwards.
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOUNG MAN!” Slipper in hand, grandma came running down the dock towards Dillon, who was re-parking the boat. “You could have killed yourselves and everyone else! Have you been drinking! You nearly made me faint!” Cameron and Gitch got off the boat, only to be hugged tightly by their grandmother.
“Yeah, sorry, I didn’t you know,” Slurring his words, Dillon knew he was caught, and seemed to forget about Cindy, who looked equally as scared and disheveled. “I was stupid and wasn’t careful, I sorry, grandma.” Then he vomited all over the boat.
Before she could yell back at him, grandma had looked into the bucket, fainted and fell into the water. She was not pleased with what they had brought back to breed in the swamp.

He was not very fashionable and only wore what was comfy to him,he didn't really care how he looked in public that much.

As he was walking across the road to the crossroads,he couldn't help but feel like someone was watching him. He always felt a bit paranoid that someone was watching his every move, but this time it was different,and was affecting him more then ever before.He never told anyone about this though because he thought it was just his imagination running wild. At least thats what he thought any sane person would say.He decided to just ignore this feeling and rushed home to get out of the cold weather. He might as well as just stay in a freezer,at least it would be warmer then this. 

When he finally got home,he unlocked the front door  slumped on his bed and turned on his Xbox.  After about 5 minutes he realized how his mother hasn't came in yet to say hello or nag at him for whatever reason yet,which is basically the daily routine. He also had no note or no phone call from her,which was also weird considering how overprotective she was off him. After a while he decided to call for her numerous times but had no reply. S he also didn't reply to any of his phone calls. He gave up after a while and started to play his xbox again,thinking she was just very busy.

 He turned the Xbox back on to kill of some time while waiting for his mum. At about 8pm Matt  started to get worried,his mum has never done anything like this before and a voice in the back of his head kept telling him something was wrong. The relationship between Matt and his mum was one of the strongest bonds you could ever imagine. They never had very big arguments or disagreements and it only grew stronger everyday. Ever since his dad ran off with his mum's ex-best friend,it felt like him and his mum against the whole world.No matter what happened she always let him knew no matter how urgent or important it was,she would never do anything like this on purpose,would she? Reluctantly he got the phone and gave her a voice message saying ""Mum if you hear this please reply,I'm worried.You haven't answered anything i sent you"",he then placed the phone down and tried to get to sleep hoping this was all a huge nightmare.

It was 9am when he woke up the next morning. The weather was surprisingly very pleasant for the middle of winter,but then again, with British weather you can never predict what will happen.He got up and went straight to his phone.Still no reply.He got to his feet and wandered round the house for any sign of her. Still nothing.He made himself some breakfast and just as he finished the doorbell rang.He felt so bubbly and happy inside,he was like a 5 year old on Christmas day. His mum was finally back!He sprang to the door faster then a bullet to unlock it,but his inside melted when he saw who was outside,it was like he was being sucked into a black hole and there was no escaping.Outside the door wasn't his mum,but the police,and he knew exactly what had happened from that second onward.

Small chains can also be heard. The man is panting, running towards a wooden door with golden engravings. He rams in the door, forgetting about the doorknob. The door hits the Jester, who then falls to the ground and breaks his nose. In the middle of the room, is the leader. Without wasting an instant, he yells

“Sire! We are under attack!” Yells the Subreddit knight.
“What?” Screams the leader, standing up
“Yes sire! Castle Repost is breaching our walls! It won't be long now!”
“What are they after?”
“The same thing as always, they wish to break Castle AdviceAnimal's walls and reach the Front Page fortress!”
“This shouldn't be a problem, our Downvote cannons are always charged! Tell me what happened!”
“They managed to outnumber us. They silently shot down our defenses with their Upvote Cannons. From that point, they burned the front gate and slowly walked in.”
“Where are they now?” Asks the Leader
“We managed to arm our comment guns and slow them down, but soon they will overpower us.” The knight explained
“Did you try calling on an ally Castle? Like Castle Funny or Castle Aww?”
“We did, but they said they could not arrive for a few days. We sent messages to Castle Atheist and Circle-Jerk, we have no response yet, but I'm sure they will refuse.”
“What about the citizens?”

A cannon shot is heard, then a smashing sound. Screams flood the air, followed by another explosion and screams of glory.

“We tried to make them leave by the secret tunnels, but many citizens took to arms and jumped into the fight. Many died and are still dying. The ones that decided to escape found that most of the tunnels were blocked. We lost many.” Explains the Knight, a hint of sadness in his voice.
“How many men do we have left?”
“When I left, a few were still standing. A few of our men have been captured and enslaved. The Fortress was still untouched, but, as we heard, that has changed.”
“Then follow me, we shall gather what few we have and craft some plan that might turn the table.” Commands the King.

The King opens the door. A few cats run away from the room. The Jester stands up and runs to the corridor, where a cannonball smashes through and hits him. The Knight goes first, but turns left. The King follows him. They walk through the stone corridors and passageways, on their way seeing the Castle Nobles running awry. The Scumbag Brain is hitting a door, trying to get in, while the Scumbag Steve and Stacy are pushing people aside, running in circles. As the Knight and King finally arrive to the armory, they realize that it's completely empty.

“Where are they all?” Asks the King
“At the walls, fighting off the enemy. We were lucky not to encounter them.”
More screams are heard, this time closer to them. Again, the same victory cries are heard. 

“We don't have any time left. The enemy is here, searching for me. We have to act now.”
“All the weapons we have left are here. A few pounds of black powder, some swords and dagger and two shields.” Counts the Knight, as he locks the door.

The King walks and sits in a corner. As he does this, the door blasts open in a cloud of fire, smoke and blood. The King screams as portions of his newest friend splatters his robes. As the smoke dies down, an orange arrow smashes into the wall next to his head. 

“So, you managed to outlive all of your little guards? No matter, you will join them soon enough.” A voice chuckles.
“So you are the new general that managed to recruit all of these newbies? You are new yourself, but competent.” Tells the King.
“Why thank you, but don't think complements will save you. I am here on a mission.” Exclaims the General
“You are competent, but still inexperienced. Exactly like your army.”  Explains the King
“And why is that?” Asks the General
“Because you didn't think this through. The worst place to be when you attack a Fortress, especially when you confront someone, is the armory.” Slowly says the King
“Explain.” Demands the General
“Let me show you.” The King says

The General and his army intensely stares at the King, while he reaches into his back pocket with his left hand. He slowly pulls out a gun.

“Downvote gun, one of the most powerful ever built” Says the King.
“Don't even think about shooting me or yourself.” Confidently says the General.

The King lets out a little laugh. He slowly points the muzzle to his left. The entire audience looks left, over to a pile of swords and daggers. As fast as he can, the King takes a shield and shoots to his right, on a pile of black powder. As the audience looks right, they see a large flash of light, then another ball of fire, smoke and blood fill the room. Screams are heard, but no victory cries are heard this time. When the smoke falls, the King uncurls from behind the shield and stands up. 

“Time to rebuild, again... Will these attacks ever end?” He sighs

As he walks out of the room, he looks at all the damage done to the Fortress and the Kingdom. A cat walks to him and starts cuddling.

The words danced in Daniel’s mind in the voice of his ever-absent businesswoman of a mother. “Well mom, maybe some things don’t,” he persuaded his conscience as he opened the squeaky bathroom door. His hands felt warm as he brushed them across his clammy forehead. He looked in the dim bathroom mirror and clumsily dropped his hands to the sink’s icy porcelain ledge and stared at a disturbingly pale visage. The eyes that met his seemed to have abyssal centers that grew larger as he gazed into them. Suddenly he found that the warmth in his hands had been replaced by a lack of any feeling at all, and the same went for his feet. By the time he realized this, his eyesight began to fail, and the room began to diminish at its edges. Daniel closed his eyes, and found that they were much harder to open again. The ceiling welled at the center in his peripheral vision as his legs buckled and gave up their purpose for the very last time. He wasn’t aware that he’d fallen until blood from the sink dripped down into his open, and now front-toothless mouth. Daniel watched the lights on the ceiling morph into the gravity well of pooling fractals as he half-swallowed a mouthful of warm blood and tooth fragments. He felt his mother’s touch; the love in her fingertips warmed his skin as she brushed his hair softly away from his forehead. She was not there. 

He heard darkness pulling away at the inside of his mind, erasing the seams of reality and easing him downward into some indescribably comfortable realm of lost moments and memories seemingly eons since passed. A melody of his own faint breathing washed over his ears and barely registered in his failing brain. The world grew dim around Daniel, and his faculties began diminish one by one. His liver, of course, was the first to succumb to the chemical punishment of nearly five-hundred Tylenol, along with his now bleeding stomach with its lining eaten away entirely by the drugs. Despite his biological deterioration, he felt quite good; calm, content, and as though he laid not on the cold, hard tile floor of his bathroom, but in the warm, loving embrace of the arms of an endless ocean. It cradled him as he sunk into its bottomless depths; the light from above growing ever so dim to his near lifeless eyes. Daniel managed to blink away the illusion of spiraling multicolored lights in a distant sky, and see the Earth as it truly was for the last time; a manila-walled bathroom with yellow-stained plastic bulb covers emitting a mild, placid light across an uncleanly world of bacteria and over-priced cleaning product residue.

It had been years, he was sure they were going to last forever. His friend had never had good luck early on, but this time things seemed different. The day she said yes was the best day of his friend’s life.  It seemed like their love was an unstoppable force a law of the universe destined to last until the end of time. 

Knowing he had a wife to go home to made everything worse when he looked at his friend. The crash had come out of nowhere. The hospital room was cold and dark. The doctor explained in cold terms and a colder tone what went wrong. Where the surgery failed to save her, and where God had abandoned him. 

“There was nothing we could do.”

His friend recoiled and sobbed as the doctor reached out to offer a consoling hand on the shoulder. The doctor retracted, and left them to their mourning. He had been his friend’s best man.  She was now cold. No soul remained in the once vibrant and bubbly corpse. Her face was bruised, but otherwise largely the same. If not for the blue-green hue of her once glowing pink flesh it would look like she was just sleeping. 
He sat there. He stared into space. 

“What am I supposed to say to a man who has lost everything? Should I give condolences that will be lost to a sad revelation that no condolences will bring love back? Should I give apologies that a fateful heartless world snatched away the only thing he had left? Should I quote meaningless songs written for the masses to identify with? 

“What do you say to the man who has lost love? Nothing can console this loss. Nothing can console this fear. Nothing can console the understandable hatred of everything and overwhelming sense of decay and hopelessness. No one can fix this. Nothing will change what has happened.”
He sat in silence, and offered a hand to the friend. In silence he helped his friend stand. He gave the only advice he could thing to give a man who had lost the world. 

“Move on.”

His friend looked at him shocked, appalled, and somewhat relieved simultaneously. He spoke again in a tone calm and collected enough that even he was shocked by his own faux composure.

“Nothing can change what has happened. No amount of obsession. No amount of remorse. No amount of fear, regression, solitude, or company will ever fix this. No advice will heal your broken heart. 

“There is nothing anyone can do for you. This is a battle you have to fight alone. You have to understand that. The only thing you can do is stand up, brush yourself off, and tell life to go fuck itself. She lost her years, you still have yours. As fucked up as this is: it was meant to happen. You have a life to live. Don’t waste it.”

With this he turned and left the room. His friend sobbing quietly in the background; the sobs grew softer as he walked away. Nothing could help his friend now. Only time would heal these wounds. 

~
Months later, he considered that day. He sat at home with his wife and son and thought. His wife playing with their infant, giggling, everyone was happy. A knock came on his door. He stood slowly and walked to the door. He opened it with deliberate purpose. 

He was greeted by a fist to his face. His friend stood at the door and offered him a hand to stand up. 
“You’re a dick. You didn’t save her. You weren’t there when I was in my darkest time, and you walked out on me. No, on us. You left me to watch them put her in the ground, alone and broken.“

He breathed deep and his face relaxed. 

“But you did help me. You did what you needed to do. You pushed me to my own feet, and made me realize that I had to do it alone. No one could have led me through that hell. Thank you.”
His friend turned and walked away with a smile and a suitcase.

My hands find themselves searching every message these rocks have to give, nails run ragged clicking in rhythm to the music preserved to each crack like notes to a score. My wrists hurt from the shackles bound to them, their embrace neither tight nor loose. The mere presence enough to remove any will to break the binds, or even to perpetuate an imagination capable of the thought to escape.

The air so thick from a rippled blanket of decay, my nose burnt by the remains of those I once considered brothers. No family behind these walls, no blood between those too depraved to shed it. To say that a life without these walls isn’t but a distant memory is a mockery of what I’ve suffered here. Every second of my life prior to its cage blazes past my eyes in patterns so intense that I’ve lost the sight for anything else. My memories of the world as I now know it are by no means a life to live, regardless of how long my stay is to be, I was dead long before my last breath.

My mind still in its endless waltz at instances takes certain pauses, eyes of miasmic storms just large enough to allow awareness. During these oppressive voids, I torment myself with the beckoning of questions. As my body turns to dust, I always have the same inquiry, forever wondering why had this not happened sooner? Had my life been ended early, the temptation of a return would be weaker, the husk left behind stronger enough to face its abysmal existence. While I would never call to the death of an innocent child, regardless of what bleak, treacherous future lay ahead, the punishment would fall too great on those still attached to the child. Any preemptive actions would be regarded heinous by even the most apathetic. 

The question while never passed by my own lips, was still on the mind of many, was why the set task of imprisonment, when the sin committed called for a permanent solution. Why hands drenched through with more crimson water than all the great seas could wash away, was left to stain the land they still fell upon. As if regret was enough of a solution, to merely whisk me away into solitude, the naive dream that death by time is any more innocent than ending by their hands. They speak of a death as merely a transition, those seen favorable go above, and are left to judge those in waiting. While those of unsavory natures go below to rot in endless turmoil for their transgressions, is that why they leave me above to rot, or is it they themselves know nothing is left beyond death. A makeshift netherrealm to stand in place of what lies they tell themselves, or maybe they feel the same sinister urges under their flesh.

I have never read it, or attempted to edit it after I was finished. It is how I felt during an argument with my girlfriend. Enjoy. 

An Afternoon In The Park
	
     There is an old man that everyday can be found on the same bench, feeding the same birds, and he always shows up at 12-noon on the dot. Although few take notice of him, he goes about his day and keeps to himself.
	It has been almost a year since his wife passed, and everyday his age starts to become more and more transparent. Every Saturday his son keeps him company. Usually the two sit in silence and face outward toward those passing by or the birds as they wrestle over crumbs of bread. Occasionally one nods to the other, and gets acknowledgments through a grunt. Call it guilt; call it the universal fear of regret that every son holds onto when they realize that they can lose a father without really ever knowing him. Today the son decides to reach out and learn something about the people who brought him into the world.
“Tell me about mom.”
	The old man stops moving. He looks out to the horizon, up to the sky, and finally right into his son’s eyes and offers a simple response of, “She was my heart and soul.” He maintained eye contact until he could no longer hide the weight of the tears that were beginning to form in his eyes. Even as a proud man he could not hide how much he truly missed his wife. Her death left him a hollow shell that could only continue on by maintaining the same mundane schedule.
	The son sat silently in a state of shocked disbelief. Throughout his life he thought he had seen every emotion possible from his father. Yet he had never seen grief such as this. When his father looked him in the eyes he could see an old lonely man. While the two had a loving relationship they had never really connected with each other. His father’s face displayed the many hardships and loss that go along with the happiness and joy in life. The youthfulness that he always attributed to his father had been replaced with a visage that resembled a young boy whose dog has ran away never to return. He wanted to lighten the mood so he tried to recall a happy family memory.
“Remember my first day of college and moving into the dorms? Remember how much mom embarrassed me by handing me a box of condoms in front of that big group of girls in the lobby?”
	Sitting on his left, all the son could see was a smile and chuckle as the old man replied, “Your face was redder than the school’s mascot.” His son would never know, but a single tear feel down the right side of the old man’s cheek as he relieved such a happy memory.

“Didn’t you and mom meet at state?” asked the son.

“Yep.” The old man replied.

“She always told me you went there to be with her and how romantic it was.”

“Nope, I went there for myself.”

	This surprised the son. He had grown up with the idea that his parents met because his father went to State to be with his mother; if this wasn’t the case, than what about all the other stories?

“Didn’t you quit drinking for mom?”

“Nope, I did it for myself.”

“What about your job? Wasn’t there a time you got offered a corporate position and you turned it down to start family?”

“Nope, I did it for myself.”

	Frustrated, his son couldn’t believe what he was hearing from the man he called father his whole life.

“What about all the money you worked for? The Corvette? The house you bought? Why you quit smoking and drinking?”

	With each question asked the old man would give the same response: “I did it for myself.” Fed up with getting nowhere the son stopped his inquiry, and the two sat in silence for a while. Eventually it became overwhelming to the son and he blurted out uncontrollably, “What did you do for mom then?” Once again the old man looked out, took a deep breath and replied:

“Everything else.”

	For the rest of the afternoon the two sat together in silence. For the first time in his life the son felt that he finally saw a glimpse of his father that he swore did not exist. The old man never made a claim toward achieving perfection in his life, but those two words will forever leave an imprint on the son’s impression of the man he calls his father.

It’s a wonder the lights still work. After all, I never would have walked into this hell hole of a pizza parlor in the first place. It’s funny how the only reason I’m alive is that this archaic building from the early twenties happened to have a damp and abysmal basement that sheltered about twenty of us while everyone else in the city dropped dead.


“Repent!” he said repeatedly, “I warned you all this would happen! I told you!” That lunatic in the corner just won’t shut up.


“Maybe if you sacrificed yourself for your gods, this wouldn’t have happened,” I blankly stated. He glanced at me for a moment and then continued to scratch at the wall. I can’t wait to get out of this miserable shack. I haven’t seen anything outside for days. We used all the pizza dough in the storage room to fill the cracks in the windows and the doors. I’m fairly certain that the dough facing outwards was cooked through because of the radiation but I’m not even gonna bother trying. It probably doesn’t taste that great anyway.


We should have seen the warning signs coming but the people simply stopped caring. They were too distracted. They let themselves be distracted. And one thing led to another as a couple of guys in lab coats and business suits wiped out most of the human race. And here we are. In a two-star pizza parlor. Twenty of us packed like sardines.

 
Well, if there is an up-side to all of this, it would take the form of a girl. Catt. Catt Mondino. I never really would have even thought about talking to her before. I never really saw the reason to. Sure she looked nice and all, but I was able to survive just fine without her, wasn’t I? I didn’t realize until now, when I’m here surrounded by these people, that I always lived life as a loner. Again, I don’t see too much of a problem with that. 


“You need some water?” Those were the first words she said to me. I shook my head. In truth, I did need some water. But why did I need her to get it for me? I easily could do so myself if I really wanted to. Anyways, she looked somewhat disappointed with my answer, and I really saw no good in leaving her in that state, so I went on. “You live in the area?”


“Well, I used to. The apartments not too far from here.” She pointed off to her left.


Those buildings probably aren’t inhabitable anymore. In my opinion, the building we were now sitting in was completely uninhabitable. I hate being around so many people all the time. They speak constantly in hushed tones. An incessant, annoying whispering. 


“Well, that’s nice. If you don’t mind, I think I’m going to sleep for a while.”


“Oh, alright then,” she replied.


I wasn’t really going to sleep. I figured that it was about time I take matters into my own two hands. That’s just the way I’d done things before this mess, and that’s how I plan to get by now. If I could just sneak out through the attic, I could head west until I reach the mountains. I’ll nab some climbing equipment along the way and make it up to the top. I had nothing personal against these people. They really were nice, with the way they always asked each other if everybody was ok, or if somebody needed this, or if somebody could use some help with that. But that just isn’t my style. 


It was a little past midnight (I think) when I headed towards the attic. Sleeping closest to the window was of course Catt. I thought back to when she asked if I needed some water. I didn’t realize it then, but there was something different about that particular instance. She genuinely reached out to help, unlike some others, who simply took to asking questions like that simply because it seemed like the thing to do after an apocalypse of sorts. They were parrots, really. 


I whispered a goodbye and climbed out the window. It was worse than I thought. The smell was unbearable. A ghastly wind flowed through the empty streets. I dropped down to the ground floor and took a stroll towards Catt’s apartment, just to see what was left. That’s when the radiation started getting to me. 


I started blacking out. I had no idea what I was doing or where I was going or why I even left. There really was nowhere else to go. I had to head back. Sure I would be back at the place I complained about without end, with those people. But still. I guess there is some good in looking out for each other. At this point, I didn’t care. By the time I got to the front door, I was barely crawling. 


I reached up to knock at the door. And before I could even do that, I blacked out completely. 


I woke up lying in the attic. Catt walked in. With a kind, warmhearted smile on her face, she asked ""You need some water now?"" I nodded, yes.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_141fmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/141fmc/a_short_story_me_and_a_buddy_wrote/,
1354162344.0,1,self.shortstories,13z510,We Don't Go to Ravenholm,SayerofCody,7,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/13z510/we_dont_go_to_ravenholm/,"Ravenholm. Once an old mining town, now a zombie infested wasteland. Ravenholm used to be a thriving mining town with great people long ago, and then later served as a stronghold for the Resistance. This stronghold managed to stay under the radar, but somehow the Combine found it. They didn’t do their usual “purge and sterilize” procedure, for this was to big a threat, they would have been outnumbered. No, instead of coming and fighting, they launched several headcrab mortars from a few towns over. The Resistance managed to stave off the headcrabs for a while, but eventually, their ranks were broken, infiltrated, and the headcrabs began gradually turning everyone into the monstrosities that we refer to as “zombies”. That was almost a year ago now, and the city is now a run down, heavily trapped, zombie infested nightmare. We have a phrase in the Resistance: “We don’t go to Ravenholm.” It’s not clever, witty, or comedic, it’s just simply a reminder of what happened and why we don’t go there, and even with all this, I’ve somehow managed to be convinced to go here by Alyx.
Alyx Vance is one of the many leaders for the Resistance, she sent me here to find an “asset” that is critical to the Resistance; Gordon Freeman. Everybody has heard of Dr. Freeman, he was formerly a theoretical physicist at Black Mesa turned Resistance. He has helped us numerous times in battle, and he was like a machine; kill one Combine, move seamlessly to a zombie, then straight to an Antlion. I wondered where he received his combat training, considering he used to be a scientist right out of MIT, maybe he used to be military, who knows? He never says anything. Ever. Anyway here I am, sent to retrieve him, but I doubt he needs any help.
My name is Alexander Sauer; I joined the resistance about three years ago. When I was around twenty five, my brother was taken to Nova Prospekt in a Combine raid, after that, I swore to get my revenge, no matter what. I was contacted by the Resistance when Alyx Vance and Barney Calhoun were passing through City 7, they heard about the raid and said I could fight for the Resistance and get the Combine off of our planet. Naturally, I joined right away to get back at the Combine for what they did to my brother; I wouldn’t let them do this to anybody else.
So, here I am, in the middle of this sad parody of what used to be a town, looking for one scientist who is supposedly able to save the world.
What a rut I have gotten myself into.
I walked out of the abandon mineshaft that led straight from Black Mesa East to Ravenholm into an open grassy area boxed in by three or four buildings; it was hard to see in the dark. A small rustling sound came from my left. I swung my handgun up to meet the perpetrator, only to find it was a crow. The crow looked at me for a second, almost sizing me up, and then flew off into the night. “Strange.” I mumbled to myself. I started heading towards a small shack with a sickly yellow light radiating from it when I heard a second rustling sound behind me, this time much bigger. I brought my gun up again to defend myself from whatever was making the noise. I peered into the darkness with my gun drawn, but I couldn’t see anything. “Birds, I guess…” I put my gun back in its holster and turned around towards the shack when I bumped into a pair of dismembered legs hanging from a tree.
“Dritt!” I swore in Norwegian, which was rare, I usually reserved that for special occasions. I stumbled backwards and tripped over a rock, falling down. My commotion had awakened a headcrab zombie from under the shack. I brought my gun up for a third time and put seven bullets in the things chest, which brought it down, but not for long. I made a b-line straight for the shack, leaping over the fallen monster and slamming the door behind me. I began taking mental inventory.
I shot seven rounds, which leaves eleven more in the clip, plus my six other magazines. I also have my SMG if worst comes to worst.
After making sure I was prepared, I checked around, looking at what the shack held. It looked like an old workshop of some kind, I saw old saw blades, propane tanks, and 2x4’s lying around. I began to wonder why a workshop would need propane, when I was interrupted by the gurgling cry that signifies a headcrab zombie. In a room I hadn’t bothered to look in, there were four or five zombies shambling towards me, thankfully there were boards nailed to the doorframe, but that wouldn’t hold them long. I began to draw my gun from my holster, when I had an idea. I returned my pistol to its home on my belt, and jogged over to the pile of propane tanks. I picked one up and, with much effort, threw it into the zombie filled room. It looked like somebody else had the same idea, because there were scorch marks on the wall. I unloaded three rounds into the tank in the middle of the room, and then dived for cover. There was a loud bang which left my ears ringing, but it took care of the zombies, so I wasn’t complaining. I vaulted over the boards and made sure the zombies were dead. I was surprised when I found the spent magazine of a pistol on the ground; it looked to be the same model as mine, which was Resistance standard issue. That told me two things; that somebody had already been through here, and recently because judging by the amount, or the lack thereof, of rust or dried blood on it. I thought to myself that it could have been Dr. Freeman, but then thought better.
It could be anybody’s magazine; it is what the Resistance gives out, after all. But what if…
I shook this thought from my head. If there was one thing I learned over the years it would be: don’t get your hopes up, you will be disappointed. If you have low expectations, you will be easily impressed and happy with the way things turn out. Too many a time I have hoped that my brother would come back from Nova Prospekt, perfectly fine and healthy, but that day never came.
After about three and a half hours of wandering around Ravenholm in the dark avoiding zombies and headcrabs alike, my eyelids began to feel heavy. I knew that I couldn’t just sleep anywhere here; almost every room, closet, and air duct was filled with all kinds of baddies. I had to find somewhere safe. Thirty minutes later, I was still looking for somewhere to rest my eyes, when some yellow paint caught my eye. I made my way over to inspect the paint, and what I saw reassured me that I was on the right track.
What I saw was a spray paint lambda with a circle around it that signified a lambda cache. Lambda caches are small stores of weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies that Resistance members have strategically placed in safe havens in and around City 17. Seeing that sign gave me immense hope, it meant that I had somewhere safe for at least the night, and also that I could resupply my weapons. The only problem was that it was on a ledge about twelve feet off of the ground. I began to scan the surrounding area for ways to get my tired body up to this beacon of hope. I saw a ladder about five hundred meters away, but there was a large group of zombies surrounding it.
Up till now, I have been mostly trying to avoid confrontation with the zombies by finding other routes around or quietly sneaking by. I whittled myself down to two options: either I would come up with a distraction and sneak by while they were busy, or I could take them head on. Conserving ammo wasn’t really a problem for me because there was a cache right after this, so I chose the latter of the two options. I decided to not take any chances and use my submachine gun this time. I pulled it around on its sling, and levelled it with the first zombie’s head. I pulled the trigger in two short, controlled bursts, so that I could keep accurate, while still putting a fair amount of lead into the former-human’s head. The short, loud reports of my gun awakened the other zombies while the first one fell to the ground. I took them down, one by one; controlled, almost machine like. In a situation such as this, I couldn’t afford to let my emotions, my thoughts, get in the way. I couldn’t let the fact that these things used to be normal people, sons, daughters, fathers, mothers… brothers… I hesitated for a second, lingering on this thought, and then my training brought me back to focus. I kept squeezing off shots until they were all gone, just in time too; my SMG was out of ammunition.
I sprinted over to the ladder and climbed up onto the roof. I made my way, rooftop to rooftop, towards the Lambda Cache, and almost nothing popped out to protest my progression. I had made it to the hatch right above the Cache; I scanned around to make sure nothing was watching me, and slipped in silently. The Cache was a small area of air duct that had been welded off from the rest of the system to preserve security. It was around five feet by five feet wide, and three feet tall. I looked around, and my heart sank. What I saw was a mattress, some tally marks on the wall, and empty ammunition cases. All the ammo had been taken! Somebody had made it here before me, and my SMG was empty! I cursed myself for assuming that there would be an abundance of ammo here. I took inventory again, I had around three clips for my handgun, plus whatever I had in the gun, but that would only get me so far. I curled up on the mattress. I needed rest; I would be able to plan better with full tanks. I began to drift off to sleep, let a warm blanket of dark drift over my body.
I had almost fallen completely asleep, when I heard a shuffling down one of the branches in the air duct. I saw one of the paths leading off wasn’t welded shut like the others, it looked as though somebody or something had broken through it with their bare hands, judging by the blood.
How had I not noticed that before? I need to keep my guard up, if I keep this up, I’m going to end up dead.
I began to reach for my pistol, but it was nowhere to be found. I looked down the duct again, this time I flicked on my flashlight to see what was making the noise. The sight that greeted me was that of a severed torso from a headcrab zombie. I crawled over to the hatch leading out, but it would stop about a quarter of the way open. I tried to look for my handgun, but, still, it eluded my eyes. I began throwing my shoulder into the hatch, trying desperately to force it open. One, two, three, four. It my shirt ripped, and after around the sixth or seventh attempt, my shoulder began to bleed. It was no use, the torso was already at my feet, making its signature gurgling cry to alert the other zombies. I threw my shoulder at the door once more, putting all my weight behind it. It opened. I scrambled out and into the open air. It appeared the torso had succeeded in alerting the other zombies, this time, they were skinny corpses that moved at superhuman speed. I began running away along the rooftops. I jumped from rooftop to rooftop, trying to put as much distance between me and the zombies. I came to an extremely high drop, with no other rooftops in sight. I saw a water tower with an open top about fifty meters from the ledge and about ten down. I decided to leap for it, because I was dead anyway if I didn’t. I backed up until I thought I had enough room to gain sufficient speed. I sprinted up to the edge as fast as I could, and then I jumped.

The pills can help me though, the pills make everything normal again. Now, where did I last put them? Damn it! I left them in the halls! Outside of this barely stable safe house. Maybe, if I’m quiet they won’t hear me. I enter the hallway, searching for the pills. I can hear them getting closer. And I know I won’t have enough time.

Those people, those demons that put me in here must be dead, or else they would’ve let me out by now, right? But the blood of former occupants suggests they couldn’t care less.

Wait! I left the pills in the vent. Ah, the vent, the perfect place to hide things. I try to ease the vent out gently, but I can hear them coming closer, I need to just tear it off like an old band-aid I think as I grip the vent tightly. The sound of the vent tearing out is terribly loud and could be heard from miles away. Maybe the terrible sound will scare them off? No, I can hear them coming closer by the second. But now I have the pills! I can stave them off. Oh no! The lights have gone out. They’re about to reach me! I choke the pills down my throat. The effect is immediate, already this terrible fate is escaping me. The lights are turning back on and the monsters are weakened. I feel great.

He smiled, seeing the familiar scene and sipped at a coffee. As he watched the snow dance through the air out the window, he thought of the potential this day had. The morning after the first blizzard was always his favorite. The trees smothered with white snow, the air fresh and cold. It also made for good hunting because all of the tracks found were fresh ones. 
   But today was not the day to hunt, nor a day to admire the fresh layer of snow from indoors. When you live in a log cabin in the hills, firewood is something you can never have enough of. He wasn’t having a shortage of it, but he knew his current cache wouldn’t last him the winter. He wanted at least another cord of oak to be sure he wouldn’t run out. He would spend his day cutting and pilling wood. 
   After George ate breakfast, he got suited up for the outdoors. He wore a thick red plaid jacket, and in his hands was .308 hunting rifle, that had been passed down from his father. He still remembered his father’s words when he presented it to him, “Son, one day this will save your life”. He brought the rifle out with him every time he went out, with those words echoing in his head. His father had definitely been right, the rifle had gotten him through many winters, and it had gotten him out some very close encounters with the wildlife. 
   George continued with his preparations, grabbing his wool hat, and tying up his steel toed boots. Once he was ready, he opened his front door, and started towards the forest trail. He knew of an area with many large ash trees, but he knew carrying the wood back would be a pain. With the new snow, he couldn’t bring a wheelbarrow, and he didn’t have any other means of transporting the wood, except by hand. The trees were about a forty-five minute walk from his cabin, but that time would be almost doubled if he was carrying the wood. 
   An idea came to him, and he turned back towards his home. He headed to his workshop, garbed a canvas tarp, and a few meters of rope. After a few minutes, and some craftsmanship, George fashioned himself a kind of sled that he could carry the wood back with. He took a second to admire his own craftiness, grabbed the sled and started back for the path. 
   He could feel the .308 against his back, and he could hear the sound of the sled gliding across the snow. He continued down the path, until he came to a section that split into 2 different directions. Knowing the woods as well as he did, he didn’t hesitate for a second. He turned to his left and kept on going. He didn’t like travelling this path; he had had some bad experiences on it. More than a few close calls with wolves have taken place there, and whenever he walked it, he was always on his guard for another attack.  Something in the snow ahead of him caught his eye, and he knelt down to examine it. His heart sank when he realized it was a wolf track, a fresh one too. 
   He immediately went for his gun that was slung on his back. He loaded a bullet into the chamber, and brought the rifle to the ready position. He scanned the horizon for wolves but didn’t see anything. Just then he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. He switched off the safety and whipped around, but saw a squirrel book it up a tree. He breathed a sigh of relief, but did not lower his rifle. He heard the ruffling of leaves behind him, and he went to turn towards it. Without even realising it, he had placed his right foot on his sled. When he turned the sled gave out, and he fell violently towards the ground, letting go of his rifle at the same time. He hit the snow just an instant before the rifle, and he had just enough time to look into the barrel of the gun before it smashed against the ground, causing it to fire a round straight through George’s skull.

The fact that something is bugging me and the realization that I can't pinpoint a concrete source begins to bug me. The smell of wet concrete is something I really enjoy. The foreboding presence of Tru-Valu Mart and its dirty parking lot is something I really don't. I end this train of thought right then and there because if i let my brain start to ponder duality then I will be in a funk all day, trust me. I turn off the car and prematurely end a song on the radio thats going on about sexy girls and crazy parties and a lot of other bullshit a creep like me doesn't relate too. When I walk through the parking lot I have a bit of a routine where I try to cram my head with thoughts that would keep me happy throughout the day. Believe you me, the minute I step into that building my good mood will be sliced perfeclty in half, as if a surgeon did it. I'm nervous now, nothing coming to mind. Come on! Hurry up you pessimistic bastard, if you don't think of anything quick your work day will feel like the longest of any eternity you can imagine! Have you not a single decent and then BAM! too late. I am inside heading towards the back. Another bad day begins. Strap on the red apron, fill out my stupid time sheet (Shop N' Save employees get time cards they get to punch in. Really? we cant upgrade just a little bit?) and begin to re-organize inventory is the back. I believe the walking dead have more free time then this. Martin, a co-worker who I think may be mexican or of some latin descent starts to work and a different project in the same vicinity. Marking the recall items, thats right. ""How ya doin man?' he says. I feel he's genuine in his concern. ""Oh, er, pretty good."" I say over my shoulder. We go back to what we were working on. After a few moments he tries to initiate another conversation. ""It's cold out today, huh?"". I can reply with ""Yea man...it's pretty crazy"". Silence again. Damn! Why must I be so horrible at conversating like a real human. I rack my brain to give him a little more to work with but nope, just nonchalant me standing here looking like an asshole. Wonderful. Ah!, Shit!, I need to do bathrooms to. Shouldve been first thing. Ok, lets get that done. With cleaning supplies in hand I enter the bathroom, leaving the door ajar. I had just sprayed some cleaner in the sink whe I noticed my sotre manager out of the corner of my eye. He name is Martha, older woman with mocha skin, glasses, and a glare that can turn your penis into ice. Evil wizard she is. I try not to make direct eye contact. Maybe if I sit perfectly still she will ignore me, as if she were a corporate T-Rex. So mcuh for that plan. She is in the bathroom way too quickly for my comfort. ""You..just started the bathroom?"" she asks me in a scolding, motherly tone. The mother I never, ever wanted. ""Yeaaaaa..."" I drone out, sonding like I have been chugging nyquil on the commute. Smooth moove, cowboy. way to defend yourself. ""So what have you been doing all morning?"". In my head I see myself perfectly explaining what happened, as sly as a politician when I speak. My rationale is so good she apologizes for being so quick too judge and promptly sticks a glock in her mouth. But back in reality I stand there dumbfounded with nothing to say. after a pause she says ""What I'm going to do is send you home. Get some rest, and come back to work when you're all there."" What? Send me home? Why? When the rush of adrenaline comes to protest this decision, she is already gone.

Mixed emotions of anger and nervousness make even unlocking my car quite the difficult escapade. I see other co-workers arriving to work and wonder if they notice that I am leaving so soon. Just think of the rumors that will begin to fester. Wait, do the people I work with even care that much about me? Would I start rumors just for the sake of conversation? Maybe I should try it. I am gettingway too ahead of myself. I need to breathe. Michelle who works in Paint walks by the car and I become very tempted to shout ""FUCK!"" at the top of my lungs and punch my steering wheel in a melodramatic fashion. I decide against it, not sure of the attention I want. I turnhe ignition and just sit there for a moment. What I had planned for today was being at work, nothing else. Now, this woman, this cruel woman with her cruel curls in her cruel hair, has succesfully thrown me in a tailspin. I can't go home becuase the dogs will panic. Why is he home so soon. Maybe I should call a friend and talk to him. Thats what a book would say, right? And what friend do I call, really? I have family members and people I see at karaoke twice a week. What could they tell me that I can't tell myself. You know what, fuck this job and fuck Martha. I don't need to be subjected to this scrutiny. One bad day and I'm being sent home. I think there may be a law against this. Should I contact an attorney? And what the hell kind of money would that cost? Maybe I should burn the place. Throw molotov cocktails into the gardening department. Maybe I should wait until I am crossing the bridge and turn the wheel sharply when I feel...

I look over at a bus stop by the store and notice two advertisements on either side. On the left, a public service announcement warning of the dangers of sending text meesages while you drive. On the right, a poster advertising make-up. It's a picture of a models face, a bright cream colored complexion, and they hint that she may not be wearing a shirt. She has her lips in a bit of a pout that most models make, and the tag line simply reads ""It's not you, it's me."" I would normally spend some ludicrous amount of time fretting about how that doesn't make any sense but I feelo an ornate calmness, the sensation of figuring out exactly what would remedy your current situation. I open my glove box (I have never once stored any kind of gloves in there, I wonder why they call it that) and take out a fine permanent marker in black. I feel anxious again, but it feels good. I am excited. I take my time as I stride, dare I say even mosey on over to the bus stop. I stare at the make-up advertisement for a moment and take in everything I hate about it. How big it is, The stupid selling line, the fact that people who ride the bus can't afford that shit in the first place and how our society always tries to tell us how to look and behave. I un-cap the marker and meticulously begin to work. Every letter is carefully drawn so there is no mistake in the message I am trying to convey.What should take a few seconds turns into five minutes. When I am finished, the poster is still in tact in its glass frame, ready for its public. Nothing too drastic, but I think I may have gotten my point across anyway. There, in the most beautiful big black bold letters across the models forehead reads the word ""SLAVE"".

It would be a nice day to read a good book by the fire. The cloud coverage gives the appearance of it being morning all day. I like this. There were a few trails I havent visited in a little while though, adventure may do my body some good. What I think I wil do though, is lay amongst those bright autumn leaves, show them some deserved attention, use the earth as a big mattress. Maybe I should be worried about my state of employment, but who has time for that. I'm comfortable now. I deserve this.

(Trigger Warning, major themes are abuse and suicide in a marriage)",homostasis,5,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/136b1j/a_scream_that_no_one_will_ever_hear_trigger/,"I retreated to my room after a severe beating.
I had spilled salt onto the table and this time it was the last straw.
My face was red from embarrassment, black from the bruise that had already formed
under my left eye, and green from the healing bruise under my right.
My head was pounding and my whole body hurt.
It took every ounce of strength I had to climb the ladder, 
so I could obey the command “Get out of my fucking sight before I do something even worse.”
This wasn’t the first time he had hit me, and it wasn’t the worst.
This time I was lucky. 
I could wait a few days til the bruise turned a lighter shade of angry and cover it with thick makeup.
I’d wear sunglasses to cover the blood vessels that had burst in my eye.
I knew all the tricks to concealing the bruises, scratches, and scars.
I invested in every cream on the market that claimed to rid your body of 
those unholy blemishes.
They half-assed worked on the smaller ones, but like the one from the kitchen knife
while I washed the dishes had to always be cleverly covered by  a scarf, or large necklace. 
It reached from one shoulder to the other.
The doctor had a hard time stitching it up. 
The emergency room had heard every one of my excuses.
I could tell from the pity in the eyes of the nurses that they didn’t believe a damn word that I was spewing,
but they couldn’t do anything about it since we were two consenting adults, and I refused to press any charges.
Pressing charges only makes things worse.

It took me several minutes to will my muscles to move enough so I could get to the attic,
which was my new “home” within my house.
I was banished here shortly after the honeymoon.
He couldn’t put up with me in bed,
and he only ventured to my accommodations in order to satiate his primal “needs”.
I learned quickly not to resist and the proper noises to make at the proper times.
Even then, there was hardly a time that I wasn’t subject to his abuses, verbal and physical.
Surfacing through the hole in the ceiling to my bare furnishings took every ounce of strength that I had.
I had clawed my way up to what I thought was my temporary sanctuary only to find a noose hanging in place of my stuffed bear that sat in the corner on his little chair.
I choked back a sob.
Not for the sight of the noose, but because I had had that bear since my early childhood.
It had been my only friend and confidant. 
Now it was gone and I had nothing.
Was this the sign I had been begging for all of these years, or just a sick joke my mind or “husband” decided to play?
I found myself drawn to this instrument of self destruction. 
It hung on a thick beam.
No one would ever know.
I had til five o’clock to decide my fate.
That’s when I had to begin preparations for his dinner.
I wasn’t allowed to eat with him.
I served him in the dining room and I ate in the kitchen.
I never feel like a wife, just a servant, an indentured servant that could never buy her freedom. 
I reached for the rope that was tied into this sinister knot, and pulled with all of my strength.
It was sturdy.
I certainly weighed enough to commit this final act, according to the things my loving “husband” relentlessly told me.
Oh how tempting this was.
I wondered if it was his idea.
He would often bring drunk women into our “home” during the witching hours and expect me to undress them and have them waiting
he would please himself and them, then punish me as soon as they sobered up and left.

The noose became more and more appealing as the clock ticked away minutes and seconds.
Minutes and seconds that I was wasting.
I needed to make a decision.
In my mind there were no cons and only pros.
I had no family that cared, no children, and a husband that wanted me dead.
Why not take my life into my own hands and end it before he had the pleasure of doing it?
My hand had not left the rope.
It was coarse and didn’t stretch.
It was perfect.
I could still hear him screaming downstairs in the dining room.
I never wished death upon him, only myself.
Every time he beat me, I prayed this would be the time that he took it one step to far.
I prayed he would plunge the knife a little deeper,
hit me just hard enough, 
break my nose and shove cartilage into my brain,
throw me down every flight of stairs in our house, not just one,
or just shoot me.
He had threatened me with a gun seven times to date.
He wouldn’t have if he knew that it would have caused me immense pleasure to have a fatal entry and exit wound through my head.
He was a surgeon though and a sadist.
He knew exactly where to plunge the knife so it wouldn’t hit anything vital.
He knew where he could hit me to cause the most pain, but not kill me.
He always missed me nose when he lunged for my face.
He knew at my stature and weight, the right way to shove me, so I wouldn’t hit my head tumbling down the stairs.
He never kept bullets in his guns, but he didn’t know I knew that.
He also didn’t know that I cleaned his guns better than he did, or that I knew the password to his gun safe.
There’s not much to do when you’re left home alone all day.

The alarm clock on the floor next to my bed read 4:30 pm.
Had four and a half hours actually elapsed since that beating? 
My knees did hurt, but I had attributed that to having my ass kicked again.
My hand was red from handling the coarse rope.
The realization of the time had brought me back to my semblance of reality,
and had given me the sense of urgency that I needed to formulate a plan.
It was now 4:35.
I would not go downstairs at five o’clock.
I would wait for him to come to me. 
He wasn’t going to win the game this time.
He was going to get his. 
I wasn’t going to hide my bruises or scars anymore.
I took my place on the chair where my bear had sat, and slipped the noose around my battered neck.
It fit like a glove.
I steadied myself and waited.
The time dragged on.
I could hear every second pass.
I could feel every last minute slip through my fingers.
At five o’clock an alarm downstairs went off.
I was screamed for.
I was told to shut the damned thing off. 
It took two minutes and forty five seconds for him to turn it off himself,
and to start his search for me.
I could hear him yelling for me in the kitchen.
Calling out what he didn’t know were going to be idle threats.
He went to his bedroom.
The bathrooms.
The dining room.
He screamed my name one last time before it occurred to him that I now slept in the attic.
I heard him approach and pull the string to the ladder to bring it down.
I heard him take his first step.
His second step.
His third step.
The abusive words grew louder with his approach.
His sixth step.
His seventh, eighth and ninth steps.
There were 13 steps all together, 
and him being a tall “man” his head was about the attic floor, and he could see me.
We locked eyes.
He stood paralyzed for a second then smirked.
He told me I didn’t have the guts.
He didn’t believe me even after I had jumped from the chair, and swung back,
crashing through the attic window and as the rope was severed by the force of my jump and the 
shattered glass, I landed on the sidewalk in front of the house.
Bloody, bruised, and thankfully dead.

	This evening was not going as planned. The car would not even crank, much less do anything else. The little black car was not old by any standard as far as cars come, rolling off the lot about two years prior, so for the engine to quit on it now only made Jeremy Soben near next to furious. His anger only further fueled the abuse Jeremy laid out upon the spent motor. Each turn of the key was met with grinding under the hood and grinding of Jeremy’s patience with the damned car. He looked out his window at the blackness of this mid-October night and knew the cold he would feel as soon as he stepped outside to contemplate his car’s lassitude. He knew he should have worn another layer. 
	Never being much of a “car dude” in school, the only thing he could think of was the power supply from the battery. He reached under the steering column, grasping for the tiny lever that would release the hood of the car. Finding a level, Jeremy pulls it only to find it has adjusted the steering column itself, not the hood. Damn it. Reaching back further, the tiny black pull-lever is latched onto and pulled quickly, making a resounded snap as it returned to its original position and a *click* as the hood pops. Jeremy makes his way around and takes a peek at the battery, shivering as he went.
	There was some corrosion around the positive and negative poles of the battery, but it certainly couldn’t have been making his car turn into a devilish rapscallion; a second opinion was necessary, and so out came the phone. Luckily the number Soben looked for was second from the top: Thomas Arnold (with Erin Aaron being right above, forever possessing the top slot, and of that Jeremy was certain). Touching the name brought the dial tone to his ears in mere seconds and a tired, gruff voice half a minute later.
	“Thomas Arnold speaking,” was what came over the speaker a lethargic few seconds following the *click* of an answered line.
	“Hey Thom, it’s Jerry. My car just broke down off Westington, and wanted the number of that guy that you were so fond of when your car had fits that one day. You remember?”
	A few moments passed before, “Oh, yeah, you mean the guy who picked up my car in, like, twenty minutes during rush hour? That would be…let’s see here…,” there was a pause on the other side of the line, “…here we go. ‘Maintenance and Tow’ is all I have in my phone for them. The number is 332-363-9464. I don’t know any people who have called them out at night, but if their daytime performance speaks for their night, you should be fixed up in seconds.”
	“Thanks, Thom, I really appreciate it. I’ll see you back at work tomorrow!”	Thom didn’t shut up about the service he got from the guy for a week. Jerry certainly thought it was time to try and validate the praise this one guy received.
	“Maintenance and Tow” was one of those discount body repair places one would see commercials for all over local television at two or three in the morning. The big selling point, as far as prices are concerned, for M&amp;T was that just one guy did the whole operation, but “the savings of employment are passed on to YOU.” Not many people call them, as it turns out, since there should be, more likely than not, a long wait since it was just the one guy. Jerry could actually see the owner’s face in his mind’s eye from the commercial: long with an angled, clean-shaven chin; mostly bald but with buzzed, dark black hair ringing the equator of his skull.
	Thinking that the wait couldn’t be very long, Jerry pulled out his phone and dialed the number as he returned to his door and got back into the car. His phone rang for what seemed like forever when, right before he was going to give up, the other line clicked and a sleepy, gravelly voice answered, “Hel—,” cleared itself with a cough, “Hello?” this time a little clearer  and less grainy. “This is—,” another cough, “this is Tow and Maintenance, the one and only Fredd Hattfield speaking. Are you in a safe place?”
	“Yeah, I’m out in a fairly well lit portion off of Westington. My name is Jeremy Soben and I’m looking to get some roadside assistance.”
	“That the ‘Westington’ in Greendale, sir?”
	“Oh, sorry, yes sir. I’m in a black Accord facing the west end of the street and I am out in front of a veterinary place…uh…the sign says ‘The Pet Spot’. My car won’t start, and I think I’m probably going to need a tow.”
	“Yeah, I know the place. Looks like it’ll be, oh, I don’t rightly know, about twenty minutes. You just sit tight, sir, and I’ll have you taken care of right quick. Just make certain you are there when I arrive.”
	Soben stowed his phone away in his pocket and reclined back in his chair, closing his eyes and contemplating what else he could be doing right at this moment. Immediately coming to mind is a warm dinner. Three days prior was Jerry’s thirtieth birthday, and in two more would be his fifth anniversary with Ashleigh, so the whole week around the two dates was special to them both: every meal each other’s favorites, every night filled with love and fun. Tonight was to be Jerry’s absolute favorite dinner: filet mignon, lobster tail with butter and lemon, and homemade mash with brown gravy. He had looked forward to it all day long, pushed through each hour at work and even skipped lunch so that dinner would be that much more sweet, and here he sat at eight at night, knowing his meal would be on the dining room table for at least half an hour before he got there, assuming this Fredd Hattfield would drop him off remotely close to home after this was all over and done with. This evening was not going as planned, but, soon enough, a fog took his mind.
	The fog was thick, the images within it fleeting. Jerry swore he saw his Ash dancing through the dense precipitation of his mind, and the sight of her made his stomach jump and butterflies flutter. More danced behind his eyes, but far from his sight, platonic forms hidden at the back of the mind but without physical body. His mind swam briefly and the long black train marched on without him. His eyes fluttered and he jumped awake, orbits wide and searching for a clock. 20:17. He’d only made the call fifteen minutes ago. He needed to call Ash, to tell her he would be late. Hopefully she wouldn’t be upset.
	As he pulled out his phone, just as “Ashleigh Soben” popped up on the little rectangular screen, as his thumb hovered over his dear wife’s number, a rap came a tapping on his car’s door. Startled, Jerry looked up and out his window, mind on high alert, only to find the long, bald head of Fredd Hattfield staring at him with a grin and smiling green eyes that should not be worn by any serviceman at any point in their life. Jerry rolled down his window, rubbing the remainder of his sleep from his red eyes. The man stood up straight, looking much taller than Jerry had pictured, wearing a thick, mud-brown, long-sleeve shirt and faded blue overalls.
	“Didn’t mean to startle you, sir. I’m Fredd Hatfield, from Maintenance and Tow. You Mr. Soben?” asked Hattfield, in slow, calculated speech.
	“Oh, no, you’re fine, and yeah, I am. Getting ready to call my wife, actually, but I suppose it can wait now that you’re here,” was Soben’s still-sleepy response.
	“Sorry to disturbed you, regardless. Mind if I take a peek under the hood?”
	Nodding his head in permission, Jerry prepared himself once again from the biting cold he would soon feel on his flesh, forgetting all about Ashleigh for the time being, while Fredd wound his way around to the front of the small car and stuck his head under the already popped hood. Hattfield’s first thought was, naturally, to look at the battery, and he immediately spotted the white build-up around the positive and negative ends.
	“That junk right there needs to be cleaned off before we go any further,” observed Hattfield quietly to himself as he produced a plastic scraping tool from his pocket. The corrosion fell away easily and proved to be minimal in volume. Telling Soben, who stood off to the side, he would return in a second, Hattfield made his way, slowly, to his truck, picked up his trusty screwdriver (with the long neck to reach those hard-to-get places), some newspaper to lay down, and hoisted a portable jump-box onto his shoulder and meandered back to the disabled car. Hooking red to red and black to black, Hattfield turned the device on and started to charge the battery.
	“While that charges, I’m just going to look under your console and see if there is anything come loose might be causin’ the problem. I’m a little greasy, so if you don’t mind I’ll lay down this paper to try an’ protect your upholstery as best I can.” Hattfield thus started spreading the paper out on the driver seat and floorboard and even put some down in the passenger seat as well, just in case.
	Jerry stood coldly by, hoping the car would get fixed so HE could drive home, but mainly wanting to get moving to some degree, be it towards a garage or his home. The cold clouded his mind in a way that sleep did, only in his case each amplified the other. He watched as Hattfield removed the bottom panel under the steering column with his long-ass screwdriver and started looking around with a small LED flashlight he pulled from his pocket, all the while “haroom-ing” and “humming.” After just a few minutes of looking and poking, Hattfield rose up a little to look at Soben and beckon him closer.
	You have a couple of wires that have come loose. Don’t know rightly how they could and you still drive around without the wheel lockin’ up on you, but the rightly sure have. Here, switch me places and look up to what will be your right.”
	They play a small game of tango as Hattfield attempts to wiggle around Soben so that one might occupy the other’s position. Finally, Jerry is lying on his back with a flashlight, looking around for what Hattfield is saying “a green and a yellow wire hangin’ around to your right.” Finally, he spots the miscreant wiring, smiled big, and said, “Damned if you weren’t right.” He wore that smile until he looked back at Fredd Hatfield right as his screwdriver plunged into his left eye socket, the tip slipping through the serous liquid, breaking the bone at the back of the orbit and plunging into his grey matter.
Hattfield smiled as he felt the steel pierce the eye, feeling the pleasure finally after so long. No one called for him at night anymore, so it was a treat to get a customer after weeks of anxious waiting by the phone. Feeling proud of himself, he wiggled the tip around, ensuring the brain matter was effectively scrambled as he pushed his tool of pain deeper into the socket until finally the handle rested on the eye. Soben tried talking, screaming, anything, but nothing would come out…at least nothing intelligible. Good. He must have disabled, among many other things, his Broca’s area—the speech center of the brain. Savoring this man’s pain as he stood over him, he clasped his hands around his throat and squeezed until this unfortunate Mr. Soben’s face turned blue. The steely smell of blood hanging in the cab of the vehicle, Fredd hoisted his wonderful plaything over his shoulder, picked up the soiled newspaper, and carried him to the tow truck. And he did it all in such a well-lit place too. My…he was becoming quite the brave little fellow.
                                                         ---      ---            ---            ---      ---
	The candles were set and lit, the nice tablecloth spread out, and Ashleigh’s favorite dining set constituted the silverware and plates upon which Jerry’s favorite meal sat. She was dressed lusciously in a red, floor length dress, the left side of which cut up to mid-thigh, with one thick strap wrapping from right breast to her left shoulder. It was brought in at the waist, further amplifying her figure. Looking down at herself, she could only smile and rub her stomach as she thought of the wonderful news she couldn't wait to share. She pulled out her chair, waiting for her lover as she watched the door in euphoric ecstasy of anticipation.

I was looking for my pillow that happened to have fallen off during my previous night’s rest. I could hear the gentle pattering of rain behind the house I spent a majority of my childhood in; the simple rain tapping at the tin roofed shed where my dad kept the lawn mower and spent more time in than I would expect, and did not understand why until later in my life. I moved my hand a little around feeling the silk coverings hanging from my bed brush my arm as I walked my fingers across the deserted floor of my childhood bedroom. It was still very early, nobody was awake yet. The only reason I woke was because of an unremembered dream which led me to seek my lost pillow for comfort. The only memory of this foggy dream was the sound of an ocean’s water sucking far away only to return in a crash. I needed something to hold onto but found nothing on my empty bed. Eventually I felt the old pillow I have used for so many years, holding memories of sneaking girls over to share this bed, and tears brought to me by my father’s cancer that taught me life isn’t fair. I pulled the pillow back onto my bed and laid my head on it, pulled up the sleeping bag i used as a blanket and closed my eyes to let my mind take me to a place without reality.
	I couldn’t fall back asleep. It may have been the rain’s increasing tempo outside or the morning sun peeking into my bedside window. After lying there for about an hour, I decided to get up and find something to eat. the hallway from my bedroom to the kitchen felt much longer than I thought it was, with the shag carpet growing under my feet and grabbing my feet, as if my house knew there was something ahead I should not come to. The carpet was pulling me down now, it wouldn’t allow me to walk any farther through my house, I needed to turn back; but when I did, my room was gone and I found myself in a place unfamiliar to anything I had seen before. The walls looked as if they evolved into something better, a fancy type of wood rich people talk about when discussing wood and whatnot. The carpet let go of my feet and I cautiously walked to the only visible door down this field of carpet which was slowly turning into grass with each additional step I took. I felt a sting on the bottom of my foot, a pain strong than that of any I’ve felt in years. I fell down and viciously grabbed my foot to find what appeared to be a wasp stinger in my foot which I tore from my throbbing foot, now dripping blood from this minor wound which exerted such powerful pain. The stinger was oozing a clear liquid from it, implementing fear that my walking would have to end here and force me to crawl to the still distant door.
	My foot was beginning to swell making walking more difficult with each step. I got to the door and opened it, finding myself blowing out birthday candles in my kitchen from years ago. My father was there, smoking a Marlboro. I was looking through this window I have opened  and stumbled across a memory I tried to repress because it was the first time I noticed my father’s cough. I stepped back from the window and fell onto the hard floor that replaced the grass I was walking on. I felt my body shake internally from this fall. 
	I opened my eyes and realized everything up to that point was a dream. I could still hear the slow rain playing dissonant music in my backyard. I sat on the edge of my bed and rubbed my useless eyes.  I had no desire to get out of bed and make use of this Saturday; I already had gone through a week of hell in school and planned on using this day for resting and possibly reading a little Vonnegut. realizing sitting on the edge was as useless as sitting on the edge of the grand canyon, I got up and started feeling around for a wall to guide me to the hall where my dream took me to a place I wish I could have forgotten. This time walking was much easier. No colors to blind me, and no door to seduce my curiosity. I was looking for my stick to feel around my path and not fall as I very often did. I walked very awkwardly, always hunched over a little and slowly moving my arms around anticipating a wall to punch me in the face. I found what I was looking for and sat at a chair in my kitchen waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened.
	My kitchen always had a strange odor to it, almost like a mixture of eggs and humus with a hint of cinnamon. I was always unsure of the birth of this smell as my mom never used any of these ingredients in her cooking. I felt the cold metal from the legs pressed against mine which soothed my heated body from the dream that was still flooding my thoughts. I needed some food to clear my mind, and started to stumble across the floor until I felt a cupboard that would contain cereal. The only cereal we had was these sugary rings that my mom bought to ensure I would not be confused by new things. I was alright with this because I did enjoy this for breakfast when Mom was not awake to make something fresh. 
	I decided to eat my cereal dry because I figured finding the milk would be too much hassle for such a little reward. I found my chair again, sat in it, and began eating the cereal. I could taste the extensive amounts of sugar felting in my mouth as I slowly chewed up these rings that I was so accustomed to eating. I finished what I had in my hand and began lying my head on the table. I listening to the rain as it soothed my mind and dozed off back into a place that reality could not even comprehend.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_12khdj,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/12khdj/sugared_rings_first_try_at_short_stories/,

Warning, the following text is meant to be funny, but is a true story.

My worst nightmare just came true. There I was, all ready to go to bed, all i had left to do was brush my hair. As I was brushing my hair, I turned around and saw the most horrible thing. It was one of those giant centipedes. There he was, just sitting there, in the 1/2 inch gap between my door frame and the wall. I was scared. I could never squish them cause I could feel their guts explode and it felt weird. So here I was, at 11 p.m. I was at a loss for words. Then I remembered seeing my dad's light on not 15 minutes earlier. I opened my door in the hopes that he was still awake. His light was off. I was on my own.

There was no way I could go to sleep knowing he was there. I had to muster up the strength to kill him. I stood there nearly 10 minutes contemplating my actions. I grabbed a notepad that I use to squash bugs. I thought about if he would be one if the smart ones that would run away as soon as he saw a shadow. I guess he wasn't smart. I finally garnered up the courage, and pressed the notepad against the wall. He fell to the ground, albeit a few legs short. He crawled to the corner. I used this opportunity to squash him once and for all, or so I hoped. He wasn't quite dead yet. I could hear his unattached legs moving on the paper. I quickly scooped him up and put him in the trash. Making sure to squash him once more for good measure.

So there you have it. I conquered my worst nightmare. What an amazing story it was. Now good night my dear readers. And may you never have to face such a terrible horror.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_128gqj,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/128gqj/my_worst_nightmare_short_story/,

The man had to die; he would have destroyed the world, even if he wore that mask to fool his audience… Everyone loved him, but didn’t know of his true intentions.”

 Many years had passed since the great civil war. Countries collapsed, governments going into anarchy. It was a disaster, and no one knew how to reverse it. How could anyone fix this mess? It’s too much for one person alone to handle.  But one man had a plan, a plan to turn all of the disaster around for the better of the world. There would be no competition either; no one else knew how to revoke the attention of the people.  This man was to give a speech, outside the city of Arcadia in the hills of the Father, televised to the entire world to get a glimpse of this savior. Although the entire world had faith in him, to save the world from the point of no return, there was a small group of souls, people who knew the truth of this man. They were known as “The Resistance” an organization bent on taking this man from his throne over the people. The Savior protested that The Resistance were only terrorists; here to frighten the everyday soul into believing of the coming end. But The Resistance knew the truth, they knew the Savior’s true motives, to fool the world into his doing, so he can gain power, and live a life of luxury with the rest of “his world” as his slaves. How do they know of this? Well, 30 years before the war, the human race took its first steps in time travel. They built a machine capable of sending messages across time, to prevent crises from occurring, such as diseases, dictators, natural disasters. It was kept as a piece of property owned by the UN, but since the civil war, it had been confirmed to be MIA. The Resistance had acquired it before the rest of the world powers could even think to keep it under wraps. Merely minutes before taking hold of the machine, they received a message from themselves, many years after he took his throne. Their suspicions were confirmed when The Savior’s name was in the message, saying “ELIMINATE AT ALL COSTS.” The day had come, the hour that the world would be saved—or doomed.
    The man wore black suit with a calm demeanor, hard eyes and showing his determination for this—this one moment that will put him in power. He spent hours practicing the speech, running it over again and again, burning every error until there wasn’t a blemish left in his presentation. The scene he was presenting in was elegant too, on a hill top facing the masses with the sun setting behind him. This will surely win the hearts of all. He held his papers in his hands, reading over each line again and again. 
	He stood on the podium constructed on the hill top, watching people from many nations flood around him. He was confident, almost too confident for the task at hand.  But power like that isn’t bestowed in everyone, maybe he had the right to be. The grass covered hill was now covered in a carpet of people, many bringing lawn chairs, others sitting on the sun warmed grass, others standing, applauding the savior on his perch. He cast a radiant smile that beamed like the sun over the viewers, even into the lenses of the cameras, sending the picture of his glow all the way to the audience at home.
	“Good evening, one and all. It is my pleasure to stand before you all today, all of the old, the weak, the weary, and give light of hope for a new future to all of us here on planet Earth today.” Cheers from the audience echoed around the hills that encased them all, like echoes of time bringing back the cheers of many other grand speeches given at this very spot. 
    “We all know of our state, war torn, the feeling of insecurity, we can’t even look our friend in the eye anymore without a flavor of doubt in our mouths. But here tonight, I would like to put a rest to those fears, so we may live in peaceful existence, like we had before the Great War.” The cheers were let out again, whistles flying through there air like released turtle doves, finding their lovers, and soaring up and on into the sky.
	
In the empty city, two men lay on a building top, like a father watching his sleeping baby; they observe their target with hardened eyes through telescopes. One man scribbled down on a small piece of paper calculations shot out by his tablet computer, the other adjusting his rifle’s scope to pinpoint perfection.
 “We can’t miss this shot, Buck.”
 “I got that memo when they gave us the file, Luci.” Buck adjusted the dial on the rifle’s scope mere millimeters, growling in anguish at himself as he made an almost unseen error in his fingers. “What’s the distance?”
 “2 miles, give or take 50 yards.”
 “Wind velocity?”
 “Wind’s commin’ right for us, at about 15 miles an hour.”
 “Damn… That’s going to be a hard shot to hit, two miles? We’re gonna break a record if we pull this off.”
  “Don’t say if, rifles have a way of bending their barrels if you don’t have faith in them.”
“Lucifer, what kind of BS did the Colonel tell you when he was in one of his “Gin and Rum” trances?”
“They do! Like the time I didn’t think I could hit that 900 meter target that George bet me to hit, I didn’t have faith, and it missed.”
“Just like the time you couldn’t get the cherry in the cup a single time in a row.”
“Still more than you, son.”
“Alright you win that one.” He placed a hand on the magazine and slid it under the rifle, reaching his gloved hands for the two legs of the bi-pod, pulling the feet down, resting them on the parapet. Buck took a single telescope and pressed his eye to the dirty lens, watching the speaking figure of the man; shout his pleas to the crowd.
“We better make this soon, we’re already behind schedule.” Lucifer took a knee and looked over his data again, looking out into the glowing sunset that painted over the horizon. 
“Just to think, we’re the ones about to save the world from the worst of all dictators.”
 “Something we can put on our resumes when if we get home.”
    “Life has the same concept of faith as rifle’s do, Buck. No such thing as an ‘if’ in the speech of a confident man.”
“Alright, enough blabber, I’m ready.”
“Pop the scope covers then, let’s save the world.”

The Savior was in his prime, the crowd stood and applauded loudly for his ideas to revert the world. His hands flourished about, painting a beautiful picture of perfect government. All the audience thought was, ‘Why haven’t we done this sooner?’ They rejoiced for this man. But soon he stopped, regaining his breath from all of his rants.
                 “Under me, there will be no war, no destruction that we have seen to our brothers and sisters, such as in the United States, where the country was terribly burned by the atomic war there. Under me we will live in harmony, our world will flourish, and humanity—WILL—RISE—AGAIN!!!” The earth shook with the rumbling of applause, the audience had decided this man will lead them to a new day, a new golden age for the human race. The Audience began to chant, “Long Live the Savior!” Over and over—again and again. It was certain, he had won their vote. But the churning thoughts inside the Savior’s mind began to bubble onto his skin. He smiled a little, the thoughts in his head taking over, his true dreams being envisioned. Those who were close enough on the top of the hill could see them, the—Illustrations to say the least, like paintings printed over and over to make a scene. They showed mass slaughters, men being whipped with shards of glass, covered in the blood of those tormented by those teeth, and a man on his forehead sitting in a golden throne encrusted with jewels of many colors. It was a scale of the Savior, sitting with a smug look on his face, a smirk as he watched unseen slaves bend their backs in determination, writhing with the stress put upon them.
   
 “What is the matter? You all look like you’ve seen a monster!”
    
  “We’re looking at one is why.” One audience member piped. The Savior looked at his skin, the pictures flowed from story of gore, death, and conquering like a movie without a plot, nothing but to shock the viewers into disbelief.
  “It’s  not what you think—,” But more and more flourished over his skin, telling tales of more and more carnages upon his flesh. But as the audience began to recede, calling up judgments to the falling king, 
   
 “Was this your true plan for us?”
    
 “You can’t keep a truth from the people forever!” Soon it was like a runoff of water in spring, people returning home to the city.
  “You can’t leave!” He called, the images growing more and more vivid, “I am your ruler! You chanted my name!” His teeth grew to pointed tips, sharp as knives heated with hate and greed, His eyes glowing red with his new found power, “I—AM—YOUR—GOD!” A wave of unfathomable energy passed over the crowd, changing their perspectives, losing all sense of logic.
    “Long live The Savior!” The entire crowd called as one, bowing to this man.

  “Buck take the shot, before it’s too late!” Lucifer hollered, at the man, who still laid prone, crosshair aligned with The Savior’s head.
  Buck paused and withdrew his eye from the scope. “Why should I listen to you, Old man? How do you know The Resistance is right about The Savior?”
	 He looked at Buck with a look of shock, “You never believed did you?” Lucifer drew his revolver slowly from his side.
    “Long live The Savior.” He mumbled, going to his knees.
    “What was that?” Lucifer asked, about to aim down his gun’s sight.
    “LONG LIVE THE SAVIOR,” he chanted louder whipping his knuckle across the old man’s face.
    “What the hell are you doing?!”
    “LONG—LIVE—THE—SAVIOR!” With a final kick, he sent Lucifer off the building side, to the doomed streets of the city below; to the floor of the doomed world they will now inhabit.

Each of the islands that were now not just home to the indigenous peoples of the Bahamas, were now also lightly populated with immigrants from Shanghai, resulting in this being the first time many of the Englishmen had ever seen fireworks. Bursts of light erupted from each island, whether it be occupied by the British Navy or pirates, almost signalling a 24 hour truce to each other. After the last of the fireworks had exploded, everyone slowly started to retire. Silence and peace fell over the port in New Providence, and life was for the living. Or so it would have seemed to any spectator at the scene.


A few miles due West of the port just outside Nassau, a tall-ship broke through the horizon. The sails had been torn and weathered in a storm, the hull was teaming with crabs and sea creatures that had got washed in through the growing leaks and holes in the side of the ship. The craft was in terrible shape, though it was obvious it had once been a proud asset to the Spanish fleet. As the ship rocked back and forth, the loose cannon balls did the same as the ship approached the harbour. A column of seagulls neared the port at the same rate of the vessel, clearly picking at something on the top deck. As dawn broke and the sun illuminated the waters, one watchman was able to spot with his telescope, saw the Spanish flag and immediately went to ring the alarm bell. However before he did, he thought he noticed something odd about this particular craft. None of the cannons were primed to shoot, despite the port being well within range. As the vessel got closer and closer he was able to make out what was attracting the seagulls; they seemed to be swarming around the remainder of the crew, who despite standing up and stumbling about, looked less than alive.


Through the narrow circle with which he inspected the ship, he could see the crew members almost crawling along the floor, unable to balance themselves. Drunk probably. As the ship approached the port, the watchman finally rang the alarm bell, and his commanding officers ordered a few rescue boats to be sent to the ship and recover any survivors. As the rowing boats approached the ship, the water damage to the craft became very apparent. They climbed up the side of the ship to inspect the crew. Once up, none of the rescue team could see or find any of the crew; only some pained groaning coming from the shadows made them think there was anyone still on board. A young crewman named George was amongst the rescue party that was sent out that morning. He had made several friends in New Providence, and was planning a family with his fiancé who until six hours ago had been his girlfriend. He only reached the second deck before one of the Risen took a chunk out of his upper arm. The impact of mouth to flesh made the lower jaw of the Risen man separate from the rest of his skull and fall onto the sodden wood, where George now lay; shivering, alone and in agonising pain. There he lay until he finally rose. Nobody who went to investigate that ship ever returned to port. Human at least.

Adam leapt over the shrub, a few white-out roses caught in his folded jeans cuffs, but he wasn't paying attention to details--it wasn't the time to pay attention. He managed to land awkwardly on his feet, almost crumpling. The impact was more than he could manage under normal circumstances, only that they weren't normal--he had been shot squarely through his left thigh, and his arms were trembling, enfolded under her back.

""Don't leave me now,"" he glanced over her face--expressionless--and looked back up, surveying the land before him; looking for a place to hide and take shelter before those arseholes could do any more damage. Luck hadn't left them after all, as he had otherwise thought. A deep, misty forest lay ahead of them, glimmering with greenish light, the colour of poison. Without thinking, he ran for it, losing himself in the grove of trees.

The sky roared with chillingly profound thunder--it had started to drizzle. He could make out her face from the lightening flickering across the sky, filtering through the leaves. She was perfectly immobile, her eyes close shut, her brows relaxed.

Kevin wonders what he's supposed to say. There must be a manual on this somewhere, a guidebook for men in this situation. As he unwraps the frozen pizza and sets the oven, he watches Laura collapse on the sofa, pick up the remote, the emptiness in her face. She stares at the black television screen. He tries to think of something to talk about, something that isn't the thing.

He decides on a topic. “I'm making a pizza,” he says. Nothing.

Again, “Would you like some?”

He wonders how long this will last, this silence. The doctor did not warn him about this, in fact they'd had no time alone, no time for Kevin to ask him, man to man, what he is supposed to talk about with her, how long she will be like this, what signs to look for should it turn serious. Kevin wishes now that he had insisted they step out of the room so his questions could be answered. In the moment, though, he'd been blindsided by his own grief, he certainly had not been expecting it, and now he finds himself feeling a bit resentful of Laura, that she cannot look at him, and he wants to tell her that it had been part of him, too.

But Laura, her eyes now focused on the remote control in her hands, knows Kevin will never understand. She can admit, of course, that he must be in some kind of pain, but maybe not, he is in the kitchen now, cooking a pizza like nothing is wrong. And what had he said to her, on the ride home? “We can try again in a few weeks.” Laura could not think about that, and she had wondered how her husband could be so insensitive.

Though the doctor told her it was highly unlikely, Laura knew she had felt the thing die. Standing, rising from the bed that morning, a slight pain in her side, insignificant, she would have thought nothing of it, except. The blood didn't come until hours later, but some part of Laura was expecting it, had felt the pain and then later, the drip in her underwear, had wondered for just a minute if she were getting her period. The doctor had said the pain was probably unrelated, a muscle cramp, she must've slept wrong, but she was unconvinced. She'd felt it die – does Kevin know what it's like to carry that?

Having put the pizza in the oven, Kevin sits now at the kitchen table, pulling the daily newspaper from its plastic wrap, scanning the headlines. The silence is maddening. She hasn't turned the television on. He thinks about the calls they should make, to his parents and hers. He does not want to hear their cries of sympathy, their packaged responses, “Everything's going to be okay,” “Time will heal this.” Perhaps even secrets, from one mother or the other, “It happened to me, too, you know.”

Of course, it happens all the time. Kevin is sure he read that somewhere, it happens more than people think, life goes on. He knows marriages survive this sort of thing, that the silence is only temporary, but his is not just any marriage and his wife is not like other wives. Laura, the beauty he'd met eight years ago, in college, the dancer. Such strength in the way she moved, he remembers. It had been the thing that first attracted him. Only after they began dating did she reveal the truth in who she was. Her dancing, in a sense, had been a sort of mask for her and a deceit for Kevin and the other men who came before. Inside, she was entirely vulnerable and painfully sensitive. Kevin remembers something he said during their first fight, though now he can't remember what the fight had been about - “It's nothing personal.” And her reaction, such anger, “I hate that phrase! It's always personal!”

He hears Laura rise from the couch – finally, some movement – and a drawer opens. He stands and peeks into the living room, she can't see him, and she is standing at the bookshelf, fidgeting with something, and as Kevin watches her, he notices that her body hasn't changed in all the years he's known her, still so lean and strong. She turns toward the sofa, and Kevin strains to see what she has done, and finally, with a flicker in the corner of his eye, he sees it, she's lit a candle.

Laura knows he's watching her, listening. It is the thing she loves most about Kevin and still the thing that drives her most crazy, that he is so attentive. She loves, too, that he cannot be fooled, that at times, he seems to see through her. When she met Kevin, she'd been waiting for a man like him. Laura so willingly engaged in the charades, wanting to appear independent and determined and feminist, like the dancers in some of her classes, yet while trying to convince, she was begging to be discovered. When Kevin held her for the first time, she remembers, it was like a quiet resignation, a peaceful surrender. She let go of the games and expectations, and just was. Brilliantly free, feeling safe and protected and, to be honest, feminine.

The down side in that liberation, and there is always a down side, is that often Kevin expects her to be weak. She imagines that while being with him had made her feel, for the first time, like a true woman, it also made him feel like a man. To protect her has become a part of his identity, certainly a part of their identity together, as a married couple. She'd wondered before what might make him vulnerable, had observed him closely as they sat in movie theaters watching tearjerkers, looking for a sign of emotion. She's ashamed to admit that once she'd even fantasized about his father's funeral, wondering if that might be the thing that would make him cry. She'd imagined taking his face in her hands as the tears came, kissing the spots where they landed, holding his big, muscular body in her tiny one, as he shuddered with the sobs.

It makes her angry to think about the thing that is happening now, the thing they aren't talking about, because Kevin expects her to be weak, and she feels weak, and she is not sure which came first.
The refrigerator opens, and Kevin grabs a beer. He checks on the pizza. There is a card hanging on the refrigerator door, it came with the flowers Laura's parents sent after learning they were pregnant. It says, “We can't wait for the new addition to our family! All the best as you begin your journey as parents. Love, Mom &amp; Dad.” Kevin contemplates throwing it away.

He walks into the living room, and is struck by how beautiful his wife is, how she has always seemed, though hard for him to admit, more beautiful in her pain. He'd noticed earlier, too, when he found her in the bathroom, sitting in front of the toilet, and he'd had the thought that she must've vomited, remembers distinctly saying to himself, it's to be expected. But as he approached, she looked up at him, and he'd seen the glassy eyes, the tears that had gathered around them, they made her blue eyes look like crystal, and she was not hysterical, Laura was rarely dramatic, but then he'd looked down, into the toilet, and seen not vomit but blood.

Kevin is standing now, she senses him behind the sofa, and seconds later, feels his fingers in her hair.

“Babe?” he says quietly. She throws her head back, the whisper feels warm, she wants more. He leans over and kisses her ear, and she is just feeling it, she tells her mind to stop working, closes her eyes and summons blackness behind them.

Kevin tries to remember the last time they made love because they needed to, wanted to. In the last few months, it's been so intentional, scheduled, even. For one purpose, to make a baby. He wants her now, and as he kisses her face, he slides his hands down her body, over her breasts. He hears her wince and he pulls them away.

The doctor had been clear. Six weeks. Rest. Then, try again. Laura doesn't want to try anymore. She, like her husband, feels like something was taken from them, the minute they began having sex to conceive. Kevin is sitting next to her now, and she can see his desire, is both thankful for and disgusted by it.

Kevin is feeling something strange, unfamiliar, something that perhaps he's felt before but always contained. The emotion now seems to be choking him, it is everywhere, in his bones, even. Perhaps it is the memory that comes to him, the memory of the last time they made love for the pleasure of it, it was the night Laura showed him the pregnancy test. It had been celebratory, fun. After Laura came, he remembers, she'd burst into laughter, so hard she cried, and through her smile, she'd whispered, “I love you.” Kevin had been thinking, there is nothing better than this.

It's Laura, finally, who breaks the silence. “I'm going to take a bath,” she says, and stands, heads for the stairs. He tries to tell her he loves her, but this thing is choking him. Instead, he watches her climb the steps until she disappears.

**Freezer Tray Popsicles**

* 1. Your favorite fruit juice
* 2. Freezer Tray
* 3. Freezer
* 4. Seran Wrap
* 5. Popsicle sticks/Toothpicks


**Preparation**
 
Take your favorite fruit juice and pour it into the tray. Tightly cover the top of the tray with seran wrap. After making sure the wrap is completely covering the freezer tray, insert toothpicks/Popsicle sticks into the center of each “cube.” Put in the freezer for an hour or two, and voila, you’ve got popsicles.
 
 
TRUE! Neverous, very, very horrifically nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? This state had sharpened my senses, not erased nor dulled them. Above all was the sense of taste acute. I could taste all things in the heaven and in the earth. I’ve tasted many things in heaven, and even more in hell. How then am I mad? Hark, and observe how healthily, how calmly I can tell the whole story.
 
I know not why the idea entered my brain, but perhaps it was the dreadfully sweet and deathly chilling taste that haunted me for a fortnight. There was no passion nor was there reason for spite, but I think it was his charm. YES! It was this. Whenever I heard him speak the words,” OH YEA!” my blood ran cold, and so by degrees, I made up my mind to rid myself of the man, at least for a while.
 
This is my point. You fancy me mad. Mad thirsty men know nothing. But you should’ve seen how wisely I proceeded—with that caution—with what foresight, with what dissimulation, I went to work! I trekked out to the nearest shopkeep and bought my tools, one by one to avoid suspicion. Nightly, I’d peek my head into the refrigerator, making sure the poor fool was sleeping. Would a madman come during daylight, to be once again tortured by his cries of “OH YEA!”?
 
Upon the eighth and final night, I peeked in as I had always done, to see the man sleeping peacefully, knowing full good and well that he’d not cry a sound soon enough. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph; what with the plan I’d made, and I chuckled at the idea that I’d finally won. Perhaps he heard me, causing him to toss and turn in his sleep. Now, you may think that I turned back, but no, the insides were still pitch black as the switch had not been switched to shed light upon my devious mayhem. Suddenly an itch took hold, and whilst I went to silence the demon, the door had opened full swing, and the man sprang out of bed and cried, ”OH YEA!”
 
I’d enough of his dastardly cries, and rather than hide, I sprang into action. I grabbed my freezer tray and lay it on the counter, and with the speed of light flooding my hands, I grabbed him by the handle and hastily poured his sweet blood into the tray. He began to groan “Oh~!” but before he could, I sealed his doom with the see-through fate of Seran wrap. Muffled, I could hear him still; the sound haunted me, so I grabbed the nearest toothpicks and proceeded to bury them into the blood of the evil bastard. I had won.
 
My hands stained with his crimson blood, I stowed him away in the freezer, to let his blood chill. For a while, things were peaceful. I could sleep at night without a sound, and go throughout my day without the cursed words leaving his tongue. Yet if you still deem me mad, you will think so no longer, when I describe how the tale unfolds.
 
After a few hours, my flatmates returned and were looking to quench their thirst with a nice glass of Kool Aid. I smiled, for what had I to fear? The fiendish soul dwelled about no longer. They searched the refrigerator to no avail, and had politely asked where he might’ve gone. I bade them search the trash can and even the container he was stored in. Clean.
 
My manner had convinced them. I was at ease. Until I could hear his ghastly call once more. “OH YEA!” Rang throughout my mind, not my ears, and as each second grew, and as my flatmates decided to trek out to find one more, and as my heart began to pulsate with the ever chilling dread of the deed I’d committed, my mind just wanted them gone. Yet, they took their sweet time, and as I became white with dread, I could hear him crying out louder, Louder, LOUDER!—
 
“Villians!” I shrieked, “quest out no more! I admit the deed! Open that freezer!—here! Here!—it is the cry of Kool Aid popsicles!”﻿",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_11qldv,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/11qldv/how_to_make_freezer_popsicles/,

My temples pound as I half fall out of bed and struggle to my feet. The door buzzer goes as I dump myself into a pair of jeans. "" Minute "" I croak, my mouth desert dry. 

I get to the door and crack it open. Bold as brass behind the screen door stands the mailman. "" Package for ya son "" he says softly with a New England slant. I open the screen door and sign for the delivery; a pair of shoes I'd ordered yesterday, or a week ago. Mailman just keeps standing there, smiling a smile that gets a little too close to his ears. I recognize this man, but I know he hasn't brought my mail before. I can't put my finger on it. About 6""6 with a farmers tan and a smile to put Willem Dafoe to shame, he's not exactly hard to miss. I surrender the battle and just chalk it up to one of those things.

I suddenly realise if I look anything like I feel, I must look like roadkill. He seems to notice this with some sort of comedic sympathy. "" Getting closer now I see "" he comments, still smiling. I don't even try to make heads or tails of this, just mumble a thank you and slouch back inside.

I don't make it to the kitchen counter before I half collapse, feeling like I'm getting a lobotomy with a railway spike. ""Christ what time was I out till last night?"" I think hard, and I can't remember anything, even from the day before. ""Must have been a real barn burner."" I claw some aspirin out of the medicine cabinet. I swallow three with water from the tap. My hands are shaking and my spit tastes like gasoline. I can feel the cold sweats starting at the base of my spine.

I pop another aspirin and stare at the bottle. Full. I swear it was almost empty when I took it out. ""Fuck it!"" I go to lie back down in bed and realise I don't even know what time it is. Looking out the window I peg it at around two in the afternoon. 

I crawl back into bed and pull the curtains. I close my eyes for what feels like seconds and then decide to check the time. 9:17pm. "" Fuck! "" I must have passed straight out. I open the curtains back up. Broad daylight, the sun hasn't moved an inch. "" The hell . . "" 

Red spots appear on my denim thigh and I put my fingers to my nose and pull them away soaked in blood. I put my head in my hands and take a minute to try and calm down.

That's when I hear the footsteps on the porch.

(Not revised/edited)",dbfart,5,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/10v1vv/addiction_please_leave_some_sort_of_comment_or/,"  Looking at the records of the past only reminds you of how much worse things have gotten as you have grown, the sad truth. We must move on, If we live in the PAST we stay in the PAST. Change isn't always bad, even if it feels that way. I realize that I currently haven't even been alive long enough to back up what i'm trying so desperately hard to explain. 
 
  In the dayS where everyone was so innocent, when cutting in the lunch line was a crime punishable by social exile, assisted by the loss of friends that you, in the PAST believed to be your ""bestest friend ever"". Little did you know that your bestest friend ever will theoretically love and hate you for the next six years of your life. Then eventually they move away leaving you to the place that you dread calling home. 
  
  The girls, they think they like you. Once they see you crack under emmense pressure (which at this point won't even be personally discovered for at least another decade), you are left for your other best friend that promptly took the travelers spot on your friends list. Then after the two dreaded years that could be correctly titled ""The Intro to the not so fantastic four"" you enter the forementioned not so fantastic four.
  
  The next four years of your life will determine you. A quote from the movie, ""Trainspotting"" which fits with such precise accuracy describes this personal judgement day, ""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television."" This is not the full quote, but quite a brilliant bit of it. This describes the dreaded four in nearly every way. What if you don't choose these things though? well there is one more choice. Addiction. Now I, by no means succumb to the peer pressure, I am still what some would call a ""good boy"" decent grades, active in extracurricular activities, plenty of friends, and no children. My choice is life. Even though the current times tell me that happiness in the future starts with happiness in the childhood, It just isn't possible. If you take the road which is, sadly more traveled in my environment, you take risks. Risks that could end your life before you could choose it, risks that could take your friends list, and destroy it. These risks are the   most dangerous things you will ever deal with until this point. The way most see it ""Choose life early, live life happily. Choose something risky, well at least you had a good time."" Thats not always true, some have life chosen by those preceding them. Those are often the worst of the lot. Not the experts that have been at the lowest possible low since adolescence. Freedom of choice is, PARENTS, is key to the choice of life.

  If you take your core personality and ponder it, you may realize that this terrible time, Is not even the beginning. Your Family, So-called Friends, hobbies, and religious beliefs are the only things that matter if you choose life. Being the only truly important factors doesn't mean they are easily maintained. Thats where your early life affects you. To maintain ""life"" you need to mimic the activities of the stereotypical ""good boy/girl"". Thats what determines how you are taken in by society. They could take you in with the other thirty-nine good boy/girls or, they could cling on to the fact that you made a single choice pertaining to the category of addiction. One sign of change, and you aren't accepted by the all so real council of life. You then, dont get to choose a job, or career. This is where you stand, at the very bottom. Right next to the people you refered to as trash. The choice of life is a very delicate one. If you spend to much time doing what you are told, then your childhood is nothing. What stories will you have to tell the family that you thought you chose? Then again, If you don't choose life early on, you don't make it because you aren't seen worthy by the council of life, but really, why should they accept newcomers so late? You felt so strongly against life, at the time it mattered, that you no longer get the freedom of decision. No life, no job, no family, no compact disk players or electrical tin can openers. Only what you chose in your early days. Addiction",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_10v1vv,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/10v1vv/addiction_please_leave_some_sort_of_comment_or/,

I was sitting, nervously waiting in some sort of office room with too many chairs.
I knew that I was outside of a conference room, though.
The room had a fairly simple setup. There was a secretary scribbling something on a notepad, a fake plastic fern in the corner, and a plain black-and-white clock up on the wall.
 
I was nervously rehearsing my answers for the interview that I knew that I was about to go to. I don’t remember what my answers were. I was just ready to tell the interviewers what they wanted to hear.

I became aware that the clock’s ticking was quite loud.
 
A pepper-haired man stuck his head out of the conference room door and said
“We’re ready for you now. Come on in.”
He went back into the room but left the door open.
 
I followed the man into the room and looked around.
Outside the window, off in the distance, I could see the sparkling ocean.
It looked so peaceful.
 
Someone’s bike reflector flashed in the sun and caused me to blink.
 
I looked in front of me and saw the pepper-haired man sitting across the table with two men that were sitting to his right and to his left.
To his right, there was a slim, tall man with nice blonde hair and blue eyes. He wore a suit and had a welcoming smile.
To his left, there was a tall, fat man with long greasy hair. He wore glasses, a wrinkled polo shirt, and had a sense of arrogance about him.
 
I donned a fake smile, shook their hands, and took my seat across from the three men.
My heart was no longer pounding.
I was relaxed and confident.
 
“So, tell me, why do you want to come to our school?” the blonde man asked.
“Yea, what makes us so special?” the fat man followed up.
 
This was a typical interview question, but for some reason it made me pause.
This was the point of no-return. My response would change my life forever.
 
 ...
 
I thought about my entire life up until this moment:
 
One time when I was only six years old, I remembered stubbing my toe while opening a door. I looked down at my foot, saw blood, and immediately panicked. I sat down and cried until my mother came to clean it up for me. She told me that there was no reason cry, because I had to be strong. I remembered the sense of duty I had to show no weakness.
 
No more than a year later, when I was seven, my mother first told me about college. She told me that I could be anything that I wanted to be in life. I was a winner, better than the rest.
However, she told me that I must always be happy.
Live your life for you, and nobody else. Only you have to deal with the decisions you make.
 
When I was nine, I was first told that I needed glasses. I remember trying on those black plastic frames at the optometrist’s office and wondering if I would look like this for the rest of my life. Later that day, I was inspecting my appearance in the bathroom mirror at home when my mother came in to talk to me. She told me that I could never be a pilot, because of my new glasses.
Maybe this meant that I couldn’t be whatever I wanted to be in life.
 
I remembered playing “Truth or Dare” when I was twelve at Brittany Winter’s birthday party. I was dared to kiss the most popular girl in school, and I did it. I spent that night lying next to her, being careful not to touch, and worrying the entire night what would happen if my mother found out what I had done.
 
When I was thirteen, I first stole beer from my friend’s father. As I was throwing up, I remembered wondering what would happen if she saw me then. This was not a part of the path to success.
 
When I was fifteen, I made my first drug deal. As I sat there waiting with my Ziploc bag in my pocket, constantly looking over my shoulder for the police, I realized that I was more afraid of my mother driving by and asking me what I was doing standing on the street corner by myself.
 
I remembered deciding at sixteen that there was more money in becoming a doctor. From there, I told myself what I wanted to hear and said that my chief motivation was to “help people.”
From then on, there was nothing stopping me from going to medical school.
After all, I was the best.
I was the smartest, most clever, and physically fit person around.
I was the one for the job.
 
 ...
 
It was then that I realized I had been staring at my feet for some while.
I looked up at the men to see all three of their faces unpatiently waiting for a reply.
The pepper-haired man re-iterated their questions:
“So, son, why do you want to come here?”
 
I thought about this question for a while and wondered how I managed to find myself sitting in that chair.
I realized that I wasn’t happy.
I didn’t know who I was anymore, or what I was doing with my life.
I have never felt so lost.
 
I finally lifted my head and looked the pepper-haired man right in the eyes.
I slowly stood up and said
 
“I don’t.”

They are usually fluttering around, some watching, some writing on their tablets. I always wonder what they are writing about; news, faces, people? What they see, or what we missed? I do not know, nope. I do not. And they move fast, really fast. Oh, and that one is smiling at me. I like it when they smile, it makes me feel warm and safe inside. They have very pretty smiles.
 
Describe them? Oh no, I couldn't, I shouldn't even try. They are the most amazing colors. Gold, red, blue, yes. And then some I have never seen in my life. Strange, swirling colors, like the color of joy. I do not know the color, but that's what color his robe is right now. They are big and strong, and small and unassuming, all at once. A living contradiction; yup, that's what they are. At least, I think they are alive. Do angels live? I'd like to think so. Nothing so beautiful could possibly be dead.
 
The other ones might be, though. I do not like them, no, not a bit. They scare me, very dark and eerie. They look like giant bats, always there, clinging to people. They are horribly, horribly ugly, with leather wings and distorted faces. Even scarier is when they pretend to be beautiful people. I am glad that they can't hide their flicking tail, or else no one would be able to tell the difference. When they smile, it's an evil, wicked smile. Sometimes they chase me. I run as fast as I can, but they are much faster. They make horrible faces and laugh like hyenas, and I scream and swing my arms and legs until they get bored and go away.
 
But they don't like the beautiful ones. That's why I stay near them, yup, that's why. I like to be where there are a lot of them, especially when they start singing. It's more beautiful than any choir I've ever heard before. They like to hang aroun the zoo. Always a lot of them there, and at the hospital near here. I don't have the money to go to the hospital though. Sometimes they help me, and point to a good spot to find food or a blanket, or a warm place to sleep at night. Yes, I like the beautiful ones a lot.
 
There are a whole bunch of them up ahead. They are all crowed around a building, fluttering around the roof and walls. Oh, good! I always like to find more spots where they hang out. They are almost covering the building, and I can't wait to go inside. That one is shaking his head at me. Why? I won't stay long, won't cause any trouble. Sometimes that bothers people, but I won't do that. I just want to go inside...
 
What happened? Oh no, this is wrong, this is very wrong. There aren't any beautiful ones in here at all. They are all looking in the windows and the skylight. But the ugly ones are everywhere, everywhere I look. They are crawling all over people sitting on the cushioned benches. There is a man up front talking to them. No, wait, it's not a man; it's one of the uglies. I almost missed his tail. That was close. None of the people are scared. Can't they see the uglies? Maybe they are used to it.
 
I am really scared. Maybe if I stand really still and quiet, they won't see me. The uglies begin hissing and smiling at me, and I'm afraid they are going to start chasing me. The people are lookinig back at me now too. They frown and glare, scooting further and further away. But I won't hurt them; it's the uglies they should be worried about. Can they really not see them? I just want to find more beautiful ones.
 
 I run back outside. The same beautiful one who shook his head at me earlier, he smiles at me, then looks in again. The colors have changed again. His robe is the color of sadness. He looks so very sad, and I start to cry. Why would people bring the uglies into such a beautiful place?

One such region, cartographically referenceable as the Country—abstract divisions of Earth; largely having political merit— Africa, saw the unlikely existence of an unyielding plant. 

It was the only tree around as far as one could see  ; an anomaly disturbing the horizon. Humans within its locality made use of it in navigation and thus it held sentimental value. It was later termed “The lonely tree”. The following is a short anecdote about this tree written by a human born many decades after the death of the tree:

*The lonely tree that existed in Africa is now widely known and celebrated for unclear reasons. As far as I can tell, people are always looking for and finding such things they claim to be inspired by. Anyway, this tree was somewhat special and more valuable than most trees because it was useful as the sole landmark of the region. One day a drunken truck driver ran it over , destroying it beyond regrowth . The death of their only landmark soured the mood of the people who had become fond of passing by it , perhaps even admiring its unlikely growth. But they moved on and accepted the unfortunate conclusion of a finite natural phenomenon.* 

*Upon discovery of this tale by tourists , the tree was given new life via literary and digital recordings of its history.  The history of the tree was deemed to have inspirational and sentimental value by sporadic tale spreaders. They expressed their wishes to have witnessed the tree in its glory despite knowing little about the geographical region , the people who resided there , or how they survived there . A page for this tree even got dedicated on Wikipedia so others may easily find out about it and long for moments past when it stood alone in the African desert . Eventually people sharing this view assembled and put up a metal monument at the location where it once stood; a true testament to their collective communication and desire.*

*The future generations of the local population may ask about the origins of such a contraption in the middle of an otherwise flat desert.* 

*Eventually it may become accepted as the lonely tree in the middle of the desert. A later day may see a drunken vehicle operator destroying it*.

Not much sleep last night. I was at an elementary school serving as security. Today there was going to be a demonstration for the kids on military might and air superiority, as a way to get young kids excited for the military. They're trying to grab 'em while they're young I guess, influence 'em now and over the years that's what they'll want to do or so they hope.

The school was located next to a mountain that the military had barred off to the public. Convenient enough there was a base not far from the school. The mountain was off limits to civilians since an accident occurred there involving military personal and the story was that some chemicals leaked out, so no one was allowed to enter it. Today however was going to be an exciting demonstration of what one of the airforce’s top-of-the-line jets could do. They were going to blow up a bus. Jets weren't actually going to do anything as explosives had already been planted and were set to go off as the jets approached for a realistic effect.

I was standing with my back next to a pillar just outside the school fences with some kids next to me eagerly awaiting the big event. The military had brought in some tanks but we were told they wouldn't be firing, they were just for show and so most of the kids weren't as exited for them.

I figured there would be a speaker giving some talk on how great these new jets were. That was the whole point right? As we waited our attention was gathered to some General Pierce, who just told us two jets would fly by once to let us know they were preparing to “fire” and then on their second approach would fire at the bus, afterwards they would come around and land for the kids to ask them questions. This is where I came in. I'm here to make sure the kids don't rush mob the guy, don't know why they would but that's what I'm being paid for. 

After Pierce said his few words he left with what seemed like more protection than anything else. Don't know what that was about except that his ego is probably through the roof. 

The jets made their first pass and the kids cheered and then got quite and awaited their next one. Then on their second pass, before they flew over the bus it exploded and all the kids cheered once again. Military personnel went to the bus and began to extinguish the fire and gather debris from the explosion.  

The jets begin to land and the first one landed outside of the school fences next to me. I didn't like the idea of the pilot landing and standing near me, all I could think was that he would end up making some crack comment how I'm what happens when you don't join the military.

After landing the pilot came out and greeted the kids. He told them to gather behind me and sit on the ground so that he could see all of them, and to raise their hands when they had a question. Everyone rose their hand as soon as they sat. As he began listening to their questions and answering them I went to spit out some gum I was chewing on and accidentally got it on the pilot's uniform. “My bad man” I said, but he just looked at me as if he didn't know why I was apologizing. The kids were kind enough to point out what I had done and he just gave me a look of disapproval. I'm sure in his head he was calling me an asshole.

He started talking again telling the kids how great it was flying a jet, how cool it was and some such nonsense. I was aggravated by the whole thing. I guess it was my fault for being security at some school. He kept talking about the perks of being in the military and not just the airforce. It was then that people starting shouting. I looked around and saw it was the cleanup crew near the bus. The were running from the mountain and just then I heard gunshots. Someone was shooting and I had no inclination as to who or where it was coming from. I immediately told the kids to return to the classrooms. 

As quickly as the shootings began, the tanks rolled up and began firing on the mountain. What the hell was going on? I looked and saw that there were men emerging from the somewhere in the mountain. They were wearing black uniforms and looked like part of the military but why would they be shooting each other? I had no idea.

The pilot went to his jet and tried to lift off but their was something wrong with it. He got out and I heard him communicating with someone, his superiors I guess. They had remotely disabled the jets as there was an immediate no fly order given over the area. The pilot was upset and he displayed it. 

He pulled out a rifle from a compartment on the jet began to head toward the mountain. I asked him what he was doing and he just looked at me and kept going. I don't know why but I followed him. He told me one the way to wherever we were headed that I needed to go back. I told him I wasn't going anywhere, I wanted to find out what was going on.

As we got closer I noticed there were shipping containers scattered about near what appeared to be the entrance to the mountain. They were covered with rock and camouflaged netting colored just like the mountain. Inside it looked like there was some installation. I had no idea what it was. People began to open fire on us as and we took cover behind one of the containers. 

He handed me a pistol along with a few clips and asked me if I knew how to use it. I had previous training and told him so.  

As the men got closer we shot them one after another but I knew we both would run out of ammo soon. We got lucky as two of them had somehow snuck past us and made their way behind the containers we had been using for cover. I only noticed them because I had just reloaded and after shooting them my heart was pounding. This was scary. I picked up their guns and they looked almost exactly like the rifle that the pilot had but there was something different about them but I couldn't put my finger on it. 

The pilot told me he was planning on heading inside. I didn't know why and he told me to stay here. I told him he was crazy but that if he was going to go in I was heading in there with him, that I couldn't let him go in alone. I must be crazy too. 

He had his orders just like the men in the tanks had theirs. They were still firing on the mountain and it could only mean that they were ordered to fire until given the order to recede. I had my orders too.

We noticed that men stopped exiting the facility as we got closer and I told him it could be some kind of ambush. He agreed and we proceeded with caution. 




Entering the facility we found men ripped apart. Their bodies were scattered about and neither of us had any idea what was did this, only that they were slaughtered. There was gunfire coming from down one of the halls. Just a few shots from a pistol I imagine. It stopped just as quickly as it started. We crept over to the one of the consoles located in the center of the room and the pilot started reading the displays. I wasn't sure what he was looking for and he didn't say when I asked him. 
Shortly after some of the same men we were firing upon began to rush into the area from one of the halls. They were retreating from something. Five of them kept firing down the hall and only hid behind the corners when they needed to reload. Some switch was activated and a doorway leading into the hall was closing, but slowly. Two of them were struck with something and fell to the ground. As one of them began to reload he saw us and yelled out to “get the hell out” while we still can. The other three didn't last long and each of them were each struck as the door finally closed. Only the one that yelled out to us seemed to be alive. I rushed over to him to find out what the hell was going on. 

There was something on the other side of the door, I could hear screeching and something clawing at the door. It sounded pissed. I asked the guy what the fuck was going on. He told me “there isn't much time. You need to leave...You need to get out...get out before...before...”. That was it, that was the last thing he said before he died. 

When I looked back to the pilot he was still on the console. I took a moment to just look around the room. There was shipping containers in here as well, some surrounding the console. After looking more closely at the containers there appeared to be burn marks as well as giant scratch marks on the edges of each. What the fuck. I didn't know and I continued to look around. There were a total of fourteen halls, and as it stood twelve of them were closed. The two that were open were on the opposite side of the room that the men just came from. Side by side and both of them went in opposite directions after a few yards. 

This pilot was still concerned about his mission and I didn't even know his name. I asked him and he just said it didn't matter, the only thing that did now was sealing the facility. I asked him why and he didn't say. He managed to get the right door to close. Damn did it close slow. I kept looking at both the last two doors expecting some horrific monster to appear but nothing did. The pilot had a grim look on his face and told me I needed to head back to his jet and bring back something just in case. I asked him about the other pilot and he assured me he was already dead. 

My head was turned only for a few moments but it was enough time for something to shoot out before the door completely sealed and hit the pilot. He fell to the ground and within seconds some sort of poison began working through his body. He wasn't in any pain other than the area he was it that I could tell. I tried to have him hang on to me as I carried him but I knew it wouldn't work. I laid him against the side of one of the containers and brought him his rifle. I asked him what I needed from the jet and through slurred words he told me there was a belt in a compartment inside the jet. He mumbled something like “I can't believe it” and I told him I would be right back.

I exited the installation and entered chaos. There were flying creatures all around. They were massive, some looked like the size of SUV's. More of the military had shown up and were firing at both the aerial creatures and the ones attacking them from the ground. I could see them out in the distance and had no idea what they were. They were in different shapes and sizes, the biggest the size of two men it seemed. I had no idea what they were and didn't care to find out. My path to the jet looked clear and so I made my way there. I thought about the kids and how they were doing. I could only imagine. 

I managed to make it to the jet without any trouble and I found the belt. It wasn't sure what I thought it would be but what it was was some sort of device. On the belt there were seven shells, a bit taller than a regular soda can and each one in bold red leaders read “Primed”. I didn't know what they would do but I had a good idea. I looked around and up at the sky. I figured I wouldn't another chance to see it.  

I headed back to where I left the pilot and found a man tending his wounds. He told me he had been poisoned, something I already knew, and that he would be unable to stand on his for awhile. I asked him if he could help carry him out and we began to lift him. Just then something struck the man and he fell, yelling in agony. I turned and saw this creature that had what appeared to have giant curved blades for arms hissing at us. I hesitated for a moment but I shot and killed it. The man was bleeding out and didn't say anything. He just looked at me if wanting to say sorry. 

I tried not to think about what I had just seen and asked the pilot if he could manage to make it out with me. He nodded and as I lifted him up he told me I would need to set the timer on one of the shells. As we stood we heard noises coming from the last hallway and turned to see creatures emerging it. We were quickly surrounded with them gnarling and growling at us.

I set the pilot down and he told me to take one of the shells off and throw it on the ground. I assumed we would be dead after so I asked the pilot his name. “Landers, Christoff Landers”. I told him mine. Lance Taylor. As the creatures approached us I lifted one of the shells off the belt and rose it high, the rushed as I threw it down.

Washington New Hampshire. The planning began in a bar, only this hair brained idea seemed to stick with me more then anyone else. Over beers, me and two friends were thinking of destinations that we could ride our motorcycles to. Being in New Hampshire, ten minutes out of the city and you are in motorcycle heaven. Twisty roads along all the best scenery possible; farms, forrests, and winding roads that follow riversides for hours. The plan was to ride up to Mt. Washington, New Hampshires' tallest peak. A date was chosen about two Sarurdays away. 
Over the next two weeks we would plan our route, our stops and where to stop for lunch.
Plans have a way of falling apart. Commitments from friends, especially commitments made at the bar, have a way of falling through. For this trip I would be on my own. 
The Saturday morning came, and I sprang out of bed ready for for action. I had my bike a 2006 Honda CBR 600rr, ready to go and recently tuned. I ate a hurried breakfast too excited to get on the road and begin my adventure. I left and jumped onto the highway, a quick blast to get the blood flowing. Merging into traffic with the throttle wide open, shifting through gears  up into sixth. Looking down I was suprised to see my speed. It didn't feel like I was going that fast. Easing up on the throttle and asimulating with the flow of the traffic around me, I took a deep breath and settled into the seat. 
The first leg of the journey was about an hour of highway. (this is a classic new hampshire coloquialism: in reference to distance, give the travel time rather then the mileage.) Legal highway riding is usually uneventful. The corners are usually mild, the engine noise is very consistent, it can almost place the rider into a lull or meditative state. You can completely forget everything. The everyday problems of your life are trivial. You aren't quite completely focused but not quite in a trance like state. This can be dangerous because you are travelling on a vehicle that you are actively balancing, at 70 mph. The actual reality is that any small mistake could kill you or leave you seriously injured. That is why the best highway rides are uneventful.
I arrived in Lincoln New Hampshire, and merged onto Route 112, also known as the Kancamangus Highway. (kank-a-mangus) This is where the real motorcycling begins. In the heart of the White Mountains, the motorcycle is free at last. Twisting turns through untouched forrest keep you sharp and alert. The air is sweet, and smells different then city air. Climbing hills with banking turns, the CBR was made for this. The hills peak quickly and just a quickly as I reach the top I am descending in the opposite direction. Constantly working the controls, just to stay on the road, takes all your focus and attention. Racing up the hills are simple enough crack the throttle open and hang on, as I reach the apex of a hill I can feel my stomach lift for a moment as the road quickly turns, I feel as though I'm going too fast to hold my line. Trusting my tires and my technique, I stay on the gas and look as far down the road as I can see. Descending hills with turns at speed is equally challenging. I make a wise decision to downshift, the engine revs up and I lose a bit of speed and gain a bit more time before the corner. I take an intentionally wide entrance to the turn, and as I lean in I can see the corner opens up into a long downhill straightaway. I open the gas all the way and let the bike stay in the lower gear until the engine crescendos. 
At the base of Mt. Washington there is a small field and a small shack. Its two dollars to take the auto road to the top. The man in the booth gives me a sticker ""this motorcycle climbed Mt. washington"" Thats a bit premature, I thought, but I accepted it and pulled over just past the shack. I got off my bike and stretched my legs. You can't see the summit from here but you can tell this mountain is quite steep. Meandering around I see a plaque. Travis Pastrana next to a Subaru, world record ascent, very quick time , forget the time but he looked happy. 
I mounted back onto my bike and began my ascent. I was suprised the road was paved. The road is nice and there are lots of trees, every now and then in the trees would be a clearing, and I could see how much altitude I was gaining. At this point the riding was very mellow. The road was paved but with very old pavement. There were cracks and potholes everywhere. I was taking in the scenery and enjoying the ascent. needing to keep my speed well below 30. Cars would wave me past, I guess figuring I was more nimble then they were amongst the bumps and holes. As I  made my way above the treeline, the pavement ends. It is replaced by a smooth dirt road. It is easy to ride on even on a sportbike. The views are spectacular even before the summit. I can see the nearby mountains, and their peaks, a sea of green forrest in painted variance that is impossible to capture. As the dirt road continues upward wrapping up the sides of the mountain, the colors around me change from green to brown. Gone are the trees and pavement, replaced by basketball sized rocks, jagged and sharp lining the road. Peering over the edge quickly makes me wish I hadnt. It is a long way down, a mistake would surely be fatal. Roads below look pencil thin, cars on then look like they could be crushed if you were to step on them. 
When I do reach the top, I am surely the only motorcycle, and an out of place one at that. Most of the other vehicles are four wheel drive SUVs and dirt splattered subaru outbacks. My CBR is next to spotless and looks very bright. I park the bike and find a rock to put under my kickstand. Up a small staircase to the mount washington weather center the wind picks up. Mt. Wahington is one of the windiest places on earth. Even on a mild day down below, the temperature, is easily 30 degrees cooler at the summit, and the wind is constant. The wind pushes  around 30 mph, and gusts to 50 every minute or so. There is a large concrete structure at the top. Inside the building are some historic photos, black and whites of some tough looking men who built the road to the summit. Also cheesy t-shirts of a tourist hanging onto a flag pole being blown horizontal by the world record wind. I left empty handed from the gift shop and went back outside. I took one more long look out from the top. Annother plaque indicated that on a clear day, you can see skyscrapers in  Boston, some 200 miles away. I made my way back to my bike and started her up, and turnded it around. From there I began a long and winding road home.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_107h0s,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/107h0s/what_its_like_to_fly/,

I grab my lunch (sandwich, yogurt, a milk) and sit down at my table. Time to do homework.
With a gargantuan yawn, arms outstretched, piggy little eyes surveying the remainder of first-lunch, she awakes. The scraps are consumed. It lumbers off in hunt of delicious, stationary sustenance.

I meet eyes with Skinnygirl; she has a malicious smile on her face. With cheeks puffed out she rocks side-to-side in her chair, a caricature of the creatures waddle.
Returning with a tray of plates loaded with enough food to feed Skinnygirl and I for a week the ritual begins.
With every meal I imagine her swelling like a balloon, breath by breath, bite by bite, the folds of her shirt are actually rolls of fat. I am not imagining. She is growing before my eyes.
Skinnygirl’s jaw has dropped in shock, I can see her food, cranberry chicken salad.

It continues to eat.
French fries, mixed vegetables, a whole burger in one bite, a fatted calf, Skinnygirl.
SHE has created her own gravitational field, my glasses are sucked in, she eats them too.
Her energy radiates as light and heat; it’s beautiful. Floating towards me she extends her hand, “Join us.”

Unfortunately i have serious doubts about what i write down and think too much on it until i get bogged down and block.

Would like some feedback(critique) on the following excerpt : 

&gt;Looking out my window i could see the lights in the city dump. The huge pile of cars, containers and assorted trash silhouetted against the night haze. Hundreds of lights entailed thousands of habitants. The slummers, as they were called, lived there. They were not allowed inside the city, though everyone knew they came into it at night. Pillaging for food scraps from the streets bellow. I lived there as a child, among them. Running between the cars and the sludge. I was safe now, as safe as a slummer child could be that is. I was one the lucky ones, most didn't make it past their childhood. Killed by city guards, freak accidents, even cannibals. 

&gt;I remember those days, when i spent my nights sneaking through the fences, avoiding patrols. Looking for a leftover dinner thrown out the window by the patrons and hunting for rats. A rat could feed our whole group, especially the fatter ones. It's funny how i feel nostalgic about those days. Nowadays i get access to the city rations. Rations are dehydrated products, vegetables grown in underground green houses with artificial lighthing and some smaller animal meat.The dehidrated dog legs and cat liver are by far the best. The days of dehydrated cow and sheep meat is long gone, I don't even remember eating any of it. The bigger animals started dying at the same time we started losing daylight and all the stocked up rations were eaten.  Rations were only distributed to the patrons, so in order to eat we had to scavenge the city. Getting inside the city was a not an easy feat. In order to leave the dump we had to crawl under an electrified fence watched by guard patrols and the ocasional howlghast. Vicious geneticly engineered creatures with an incredible sense of smell and thick musculate legs. A ghast bite could rip a grown man apart, and they often did. Guards had the cruel habit of releasing their ghast in the dump and betting on which one would bring the bigger piece. Sometimes we just sat there watching the patrols, looking for a way in. We weren't allways sucessful, we had to wait for them to get distracted in order to sneak behind them.

Because that's what you do when a random cutie comes into the elevator and sends you a dashing smile.

And when the elevator broke, I'd say something funny, like, ""Well, I meant to break the ice, but I think I accidentally got the elevator instead."" Cue my cute smile, and blush. I'd throw a nervous hand up into blonde curls, and just look at him with big brown eyes while biting my lip. He'd be cool about it, chuckle, and just roll with it. We'd start talking.

I'd bring up random questions, and talk to him like he was closer to me than God. Just really honest, heart to heart conversations. When he asked me about my childhood, I wouldn't be afraid to put some of the nitty gritty ugly stuff out there, but I'd put perspective. About how I've grown up. I'm independent. I'm over all that pain. And I'm new in the city.

He'd tell me he's been raised here all his life, and that his mom just passed away. I'd understand, because my mom was my only role model. He knew that, too, based on my story. He's actually on the way to clean out her apartment, and the only key he could find is the one was the one he decorated for her in third grade. He tears up as he shows me, it's the only key floating around in his pocket not attached to a key ring.

I hold his hand, and tell him it's going to be okay. That when this elevator starts working, he doesn't have to clean up his past alone. I'll help him, because even though I have work to do, this just feels right.

And he starts to smile, and thanks me, and holds me tight. And just as he's about to kiss me, the elevator starts again. We make out until it reaches his floor.

We giggle. We go back to his late-mother's apartment holding hands. We have passionate sex on the floor. And when I'm done, I look up on the pictures and see his family photo. He's sitting for the portrait with his wife and three children.

And I feel like a broken elevator, I can't decide whether or not to go down back to my room or back up to bed with him.

Steve didn’t honestly understand the intended purpose of the meeting until thirty minutes had passed since she had departed and he had been sitting in his car with the key in the ignition, but in the ‘off’ position. It was then that Steve realized that Cold had a very distinct smell. 

Steve just wasn’t Her type of person.

Or would it be “Her’s type of person”? Steve wasn’t really quite sure about the grammatical ramifications of having a name like Her. They had been together for so long, he and Her, that he no longer thought of Her by her proper name, but instead by the name that his friends had picked up using. “Are you bringing Her?” “Is this yours or is this Her’s?” “Don’t you think about anything besides Her?” That last one was a tricky question, Steve had found, as he did think about things that weren’t Her, but mostly because of Her (Her’s?) influence. He thought about the bands she enjoyed, the movies they’d watched together, and the fact that he hated sleeping/eating/being alone, but those were all related to Her, weren’t they? If he thought of Her as “Her,” did he also have to capitalize “She”? Who thought about this kind of stuff anyways?

But that’s just the type of person Steve is.

When Steve was in 3rd grade, his class had taken a trip to the capitol. The school organizers had decided that the most cost efficient and practical way to transport the 30-some-odd kids 600 miles was to take the Ferry, which would end up being a 3 days/2 nights (one way) journey. Steve’s mom had packed him a sack that contained enough food and clothing to last the 9 days that Steve was to be gone. 
The first day on the ferry, the weather was dreadful and the ferry was taking on 6 foot swells. The rocking had excited most of the children, who went out onto the deck to feel the ocean spray, but the motion simply made Steve miss his mother and he decided to curl up with his sack of loving food and clothes at 7:30pm, more than an hour and half before the other children would retire. That night, Steve vomited all over his sack, rendering the food inedible. The next day, Steve, dressed in the clothes of one of his school mates, lived off a diet of complementary saltine crackers provided by the ferry company. On the third day, Steve was feeling quite better and, with a new found sense of confidence, decided to spend all of his mother’s allotted $15 dollars at the ferry restaurant, which gained him a meal of Fruity Pebbles, chocolate milk, cherry yogurt, and 2 packages of Certs, which he promptly threw up within 10 minutes of finishing.

Because that’s the type of person that Steve is.

	Steve had never had particular difficulty getting into relationships with women, as he was genuinely interested in and interesting to other people. The biggest problem for Steve (until Her, of course) was maintaining his interest for more than a few months. The girlfriend before Her was a cute little girl, about three quarters of a foot shorter than Steve, with long, well maintained, nice smelling brown hair. They hung out for five months. They had sex twice. Steve then realized how completely incompatible they were. How could he ever spend any portion of his life with someone who was mildly religious? Or didn’t appreciate the meaningful subtleties of a composition by The Smiths? Besides, Steve had Her on his mind the whole time.

Because that’s the kind of person that Steve was.

	When Steve was still a teenager, Steve would sometimes let go of the wheel of his car and watch as he drifted towards the oncoming traffic. Steve often sat on the roof of his house, smoking cigarettes and daring himself to jump. Steve bit his nails and listened to sad lo-fi bands and cried when he drove long distances and had panic attacks at school and cursed a little bit too much and considered begging his Doctor Mother for a prescription for some sort of anti-depressant or anti-anxiety or anti-something pill or something because anything was better than what Steve felt that he was dealing with.

Because that was just the type of person that Steve was.

	Once, Steve drove 30 miles to visit his biological father. He knocked on his father’s door and, when finding no response, was surprised to learn that the door wasn’t locked at all. Immediately, Steve was returned to that ferry ride, the stench of vomit with a needy feeling and a rocking sensation. Steve found his father face down on his couch, surrounded by cans and bottles of beer. Handles of liquor. Anti-depressants and sleeping aids. There was a unhealthy looking dog tied up in the kitchen that Steve had never seen before who wouldn’t stop barking. Steve sat on the edge of the couch, checked his father’s pulse with two fingers, and then wrote a note that said:

“I love you, dad.”

Steve placed the note in his father’s hand, kissed his dad on the forehead, and left. Steve didn’t go home, though. He drove in the opposite direction until he ran out of gas.

Steve was just that type of person sometimes.

	Steve was still sitting in his car, in the middle of the winter, without the engine on. Steve wondered whether or not the salt content of tears made them freeze at a lower temperature than normal water. Do people who eat a lot of salty foods have saltier tears? What gives someone high blood pressure? Steve asked the ghost that lived in his car what type of person would consider him their type of person. As usual, the phantom didn’t respond. Steve turned on his car. He wondered whether or not he was an optimist. Would an optimist want there to be a heaven? Or would he rather rot in the ground, free for eternity? Steve supposed it really depended on what type of person they had been in their life. Steve asked the ghost whether or not his father had been an optimist. The ghost didn’t respond. Probably, thought Steve. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_yadzm,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/yadzm/steve_has_a_lot_on_his_mind/,

Its artificially pumped atmosphere visibly pulled towards its twin, slowly being teased out into the dead space around it. Sitting cradled between the two was a carrier ship, nearly a quarter of the size of one of the dwarves. The ship was an almost perfect cylinder, slightly tapered on both ends. All along its riveted sides, many legged landing craft waited to be deployed. One of them flashed to life. In the thinly stretched atmosphere the normal noise of sirens and grinding steel the signaled the release of one of the landers was damped to a near whisper.

The lander dislodged its legs from the side of the craft and reversed them downward toward the planet below. Once it was completely free and the magnetic teeth firmly gripped the craft unlatched. leaving it tethered only by a looping black cord. for a moment it lay motionless until a gust of pressurized air sent it adrift in the pitch black space around it. It drifted further and further from its home until being snapped up by the gravity of the planet below. It started to tumble faster and faster but the cord snapped taught catching the tiny craft.

The lander was lowered slowly, carefully, like some giant, many legged spider dissenting on the dust bellow. Cranks clicked as the craft was lowered, swaying in the light breeze from the unmoving carrier ship so many kilometers above. When the craft was 20 feet above the cracked dry earth it, save for the light hushing of hydraulic joints, silently dissented on its prey. One of by one each of its eight legs gently grasped the surface, stirring up the dust around the each of the padded landing feet like sand stirred up in a river bed, cloaking the intruder from the barren plain. The ground pressed down two or three inches, struggling to hold the foreign weight.

The metal beast sat unmoving for a movement. With an audible a hiss and a click the magnetic bond between the lander and the barely visible carrier craft. After a moment the tether between the two ships shuttered. The rope whizzed up moving at a blur, perfectly straight, the noise even cutting through the insulted chambers within the metal craft. Lights flicked on in unison all along the landing gear and illuminating the dust around it that had just begun to settle, lighting up the dark around it in a perfect circle of swirling eerie fog.

A red light stained the fog, pulsing harshly. A platform lowered smoothly from the hovering underbelly of the craft. As it began to lower worried feet peeked out, shifting slightly as they were hit by the chilling breeze now filling the tightly packed innards of their lander. As the platform continued its descent the wind began to pick up, blowing away the last remainder of the stirred up sand. The light reached father in the now clear air. Catching on small rocks and cracks, radiating shadows around the steady light. Dust curled around the metal rectangle as it finally pressed against the powder ground.

For a moment the men shuffled uneasily, moving only an inch as they exhaled. Pressed shoulder to shoulder the three men adjusted their boot straps and checked the atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels on their wrists, all stable. After the moment of hesitation they stepped off, one by one, leaving shallow boot prints in the sand. One of the men, the tallest, walked out away from the crouching ship and Reaching out into the fading umbra, he was careful to keep both feet planted in the brightest part of the light he could. He paused before reaching behind his neck to turn a small dial fixed to his collar. With a warm hum a small light on his wrist grew to life. The father he turned it the stronger a soft light shining from his sleeve became. He shined the light in front of him scattering the darkness and forming a tunnel of white clean light 15 feet in front of him, collapsing slowly after that.

A grey pole, half the man’s height cast a shadow that cut the tunnel clean in two. He looked back at his to companions who had barely moved off the platform. The one farther back smiled sheepishly. He flipped on his wrist light on and clapped the still unmoving third man on the shoulder, jolting him. He spat on the grey dust which hugely grew dark with the moisture and flicked on his light.

The two men flanked him, their red striped suits crinkling as they walked. The first held back a minute to pick up a small sliver case from the edge of the platform and then went to join his companions that still stood unmoving. The two others joined their lights to widening the tunnel and forcing the clean black shadow to spilt into three fading rays. With a glace to his companions the man with the case shuffled forward down the tunnel keeping his back hunched and his light trained on the grey stones in front of him. As he got father down the tunnel sweat began to drip down his forehead and dripped down marking his way like bread crumbs.

As Reached out his hand to grasp he pole the two wrist-lights behind him flicked in unison leaving him, for a half a second an island in suffocating darkness. He turned back to him companions his face stained white from their relight lights. They blinked back, the one in the red striped suit fiddled with the gauges on his sleeve causing his light to bob. He exhaled and turned back around to his destination he reached out again to the pole and again the light behind him flicked, he didn’t bother to turn around again and the reached out and grabbed it. The lights flicked again, this time not only lights on the teams wrists but the florescent tubes lining the landers legs all in unison, plunging him, just for a fraction second, into complete darkness.

The man tried to turn and run back to his companions but he found he could not move his hand form the pole. He shuffled around the pole to face the lander, his back toward the unending darkness of 750X. He stared longingly into the eyes of companions as he nearly dislocated his shoulder in a vain attempt to rip the fused fabric off the pole. They only stared back at him eyes wide. He could see one screaming wildly in his suit but in his panic had not turned on any means of communication. His companion shook him, trying to get his attention but the man wouldn’t take his eyes off what had a vice grip on his brain after what felt like hours he stopped and pointed slowly behind the man at the pole, still franticly trying to remove his hand from its grasp.

For a moment the two men’s eyes met and turned to look at whatever the deranged man was looking at. He shuffled over turning his back once more to the lander and saw, nothing. Just the same empty darkness and fuzzy outlines of some of the closer rocks greeted him. He was about to flip on his communicator when all the lights, save for the one on his wrists went dead. He spun the light around, it was only able reach as far as the closest lander feet but that was all he saw. The two other men had vanished in an instant without a sound. He called out on every channel on my communicator. The booster to contact the carrier ship was an impossible twenty feet away on the lander platform.

A light scraping brought his attention to his left. He called out the names of his two companions but no one answered. He heard the sound again to right and whirled around as far as his trapped hand would allow. He shone his light out but again only rocks and dust. He heard the sound again, closer, more clearly, like two sheets of sandpaper being rubbed together.

His hand released form pole and he broke out into a run, shining his light wildly. Launched himself towards the lander. The noise was all around him as he struggled to get up. He shook his head. Not like sand paper like wings, thousands and thousands of scarping wings. He could feel them pressing in him clinging to his suit, weighing him down. He could feel the suit pressing against his skin as they struggled to pull him farther into the swirling darkness. They pushed into the light of his wrist light. Tentatively at first but then they pushed against each other until it too flickered and died. Dwarf planet 750X once again devoid of light.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_xzd8t,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/xzd8t/darkness_a_shortish_short_story_scifi/,
1344133545.0,1,self.shortstories,xp4hn,Ray's Cabin ,,4,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/xp4hn/rays_cabin/,"She would have taken it all- his savings, the pills in the medicine cabinet. She even fought his children for the lakefront cabin. If she would have won, I picture her still sitting in an adirondack chair, paint chips scratching her thick sun-splotched thighs, gazing into the waters- stoned.

Grandma would take us over to his property and dock the boat. While they went inside us kids would take our flip-flops off and wade out into the shore knowing that the water wasn’t more than waste deep for fifteen feet out and it was rock-free. If our feet didn’t stir the waters too much, we would hesitantly pick up crayfish, making multiple jabs into the water trying to pretend that we weren’t scared when their exoskeletons curled inwards and their claws reached for our fingers. If we grabbed them in just the right place where they couldn’t retaliate we’d chase each other with them taking pleasure in one another’s screams for mercy.

 When the east shore wind picked up and raised goose-bumps prodded us to retreat inside we’d sit there on the itchy brown couch and pick through the glass tray of hard candies hoping we would find a good one. Ray would sit there in his rocking chair, telling stories while always keeping the chair moving with a subtle jab of his loafers on the rotting wood floors. He was as restless as the lake itself. It seemed as if he was afraid of not moving. Afraid that if he stopped rocking, the lake would be still, and someone, somewhere would say that the lake was dead today. Ray was thirty years older than Aunt Janie as everyone always had a way of bringing up on the rides home. 

That’s all I really remember of Ray. The memories are serene, but they move you in a gentle way. His pipe creating a fog and his blue-grey eyes glistening like light houses as he reminisced about his youth. I really haven’t thought about him much except on boat rides when we pass the shoreline in front of his house or when we talk about Aunt Janie and where we think she might be.

I saw Ray’s son today, although I didn’t know who he was at first, but he remembered me. We talked out his father, about what I remembered of him and the summer days spent out on the lake. I guess she even took the hammock, but he replaced it with a better one that you can fit two people in.

I don’t know what Ray saw in her, but I know he loved her. In her own dysfunctional way I think she loved him too. Her unsteadiness gave him purpose and like a beacon he always made sure she found her way home. But she is lost now. One after another, men lay their hands on her and she drowns herself in booze as she drifts further from home. The only reason she stays afloat anymore is because of the buoys and buoys of pills.

It was afternoon, so this failed to create the effect of complete darkness. Rather, it caused a bluish dimness to permeate the room. How dramatic, he mused, but it soon passed from his mind, replaced by a shade of some other train of thought.

It was only a shade because he had never truly had a fully formed thought about it. ‘It’ was an emotionally destructive event that had happened only a day prior. The thoughts he had had about it weren’t full in that they lacked any amount of emotion; they were totally logical, totally reasonable.

He was no stranger to such a thing; this had happened to him a number of times before in similar situations, but an emotional shock had always come a few hours later. Not this time. The fact that it had been a full day and nothing of the sort had transpired was enough for him to know the shock would never come.

The event was that his girlfriend had broken up with him. Naturally, the few people he had informed had given him plenty of advice on the matter. “There are other fish in the sea”; “Don’t give up! You can get her back!”; “Don’t be too sad”.

‘There are other fish in the sea’ was entirely obvious. The boy knew he would eventually find someone else, forget about his old girlfriend, and be happy. He knew that there was no such thing as “the one”.

‘Don’t give up! You can get her back!’ was foolish: no he couldn’t. The only way she would want to be with him again would be if she made the decision of her own accord. People were stubborn. Unwavering. Illogical. Their minds could not be changed on these matters.

‘Don’t be too sad’ was the most curious. Its stupidity and uselessness aside, the boy seemed to be following it of his own accord with his aforementioned lack of emotional thoughts. He had felt no rush of sadness, of helplessness or of desperation. His sadness had been private, internal. Its effects on his behavior were nothing more than some tiredness, and perhaps a tendency not to laugh as hard at jokes. Anyone who was unaware what had happened would assume he was just low on sleep; not that an event of immense consequence had just occurred in his life. Quiet sadness.

The boy knew from experience (both personal and of others) that ‘getting over a breakup’ typically involves a feeling of superiority, of maturing, of scorning your former partner. This was foolish, he felt. It was natural, and he had nearly given into it, but he had stopped himself. Perhaps he was above her, but not by all that much. He tried his best not to think any lower of her than she objectively deserved. 
The silhouette of a tree outside his window shone through the shades. He stared as it danced in the wind for half a minute, then blinked. 
Seemingly out of nowhere, the words ‘stupid bitch’ entered his mind, but he shook them off. There it is again, he thought; that unrelenting desire to show himself that it didn’t matter. That she was inconsequential, and that the prior event had been a fortunate one. But it hadn’t been. And he knew that he could never truly ‘get over her’ unless he accepted that it had indeed been a bad occurrence. 
And she truly was not a stupid bitch. She was a wonderful, intelligent girl, who had been nearly perfect for him. And yet, she possessed a select few qualities that made the two of them incompatible. It was a terrible shame.

At that moment, his mother opened his bedroom door, bringing in light from the hallway, “There you are, sweetie. I’ve been looking for you. What are you doing in here all by yourself?”

“Nothing, Mom. I was just going to go mow the lawn.”

She smiled, nodded and left the room. The boy followed a few moments later, and went to get the mower.

###Children###
By Miles B.



“We were such kids back then.” She sighed.
 
The vapor from her breath hung cold in the air, sentence unanswered. Hollow clouds crept quietly above us, barely masking the minuscule drops of light making up our universe. Eventually I replied with an equally ambiguous exhale, but it didn’t matter. Our thoughts were in the same place, even if our hearts had drifted. She nuzzled her head into my shoulder, familiar and unnoticed, and we gazed into the flames.
 
The fire licked distantly at our cheeks, supported only by popping embers and softly glowing pine. The heat helped, but the December chill still crept through our layers. Moist pine needles were nipping through our jeans.
 
“This feels right,” I decided. “It was the right thing to do.” We continued to watch as the structure blackened and charred, collapsing into ash and rubble.
 
Earlier that evening we had driven east, past the city outskirts and into the mountains. Streetlights and buildings no longer led our way, but rather a patchwork of tiny lights above us, leading us forward. We drove past fences, beyond street signs, and into the forest. Our car slowly shrank, and we became infants among the tall pines lining our path. We kept driving, until the neatly groomed asphalt turned slowly into cracking concrete, which eventually shattered into gravel. Unsurfaced and uncertain, the road trembled us towards our destination""to the cabin.
 
I had found the old shack (or what remained of it) a few summers before; forgotten and alone. It was a silent place to visit, but bared the scars of various tenants from over the years. Families and fathers, teenagers and addicts, creatures and insects. They were all the same anyway: wildlife.
 
The structure was like a halfway house for fuckups, recovering their way back into homelessness. It rested at a perpetual slant, littered with broken glass and rusted beer cans. It had a sloping roof that was straining to cave in, yearning for the sweet release of failure. The crumbled remains of a stone fireplace could be seen through four panes of cracked glass, half-burnt chair legs and used condom wrappers rested below its chimney. The front porch was a mess of rotten wood and missing planks, featuring a set of broken and splintered steps. The fractures were possibly from the weather, but more likely just fatigue, like everything else at the house, they were tired.
 
It had served as a shelter for the forgotten, a canvas to the vandals, and a glistening beacon of human apathy in my eyes. It was beautiful.
 
“You know I loved you…” she tried again, searching for the approval of an answer.
“You were fourteen.” I replied. It was all I needed to say.
 
We watched from the dirt, illuminated by the fire. Her freckled cheeks flickered in the glow. I could see her nose was runny and pink, despite the immediate heat of an open flame. The winter always took its toll. We were bundled in beanies and jackets, hoodies and scarves. Our breath danced in front of us, as if mocking the subsiding flames before swiftly being evaporated.
 
 “Yeah, and you were sixteen,” she continued, “So it’s not like age changes anything.” Her head shifted uncomfortably against my jacket.
“Whatever you say, kiddo.” I replied. She restlessly repositioned again.
 
Initially, the house hadn’t ignited as quickly as expected. At first, the flames merely traveled along the walls, not fully sinking into them, until aided by gasoline and lighter fluid. Finally the relentless heat managed to tear through the dew soaked paneling and consume the dry wood below. From there it grew. The sound of hissing floorboards and cracking doorframes echoed through the trees. Glass bits snapped and fumbled out of place, only feeding the chaos. BOOM. Something big exploded. Strained roof supports finally gave out, and the scale of the house came crashing inward. As the walls came down, the flames grew higher.
 
The cabin only had two rooms: a bedroom, a kitchen, and a bathroom (the bathroom’s toilet was rusted shut so it didn’t really count). The bedroom was occupied by ancient cobwebs and a moldy flannel sleeping bag""both slowly turning to earth. The kitchen also worked as a living room. It housed a fireplace, two broken chairs, scattered trash and plastic bags, and a worn, faded rug. Mold covered everything in a stench too hard to swallow, like thick phlegm coating the back of your throat. It was a sanctuary to some, rock bottom for others.
 
“Well I’ve missed you.” She kept on.
“I miss you too.” I replied.
 
When we were together, her and I, it wasn’t for very long""at least not by current standards. But we were children then, and six months was a lifetime. Scribbled notes had turned into nervous phone calls, flowers became promises, and backseats turned into chapels. It was us against the world""and it was pointless.
 
We were dreamers then, still are I guess, but in our own way. We saw life differently at that age. Young love carries a heavy portfolio.
 
Lust. Naivety. Passion. They were all our downfall.
 
The last time I’d seen her face prior to this was through the crack of an old wooden door, seconds before it was slammed in my face. But I guess that’s the way things go; endearing had become annoying, promises became disappointments, and faults turned into canyons between us. We didn’t communicate. We didn’t love. We just… were.
 
This was years ago, of course. We’d both changed since then, for the better. But so much was left unspoken, so much left up to interpretation. We needed closure""I needed it to end. 
 
“But won’t it burn everything down? She asked days before.
“It’s the right thing to do.” I responded. I didn’t even have to think. Her cheeks slowly crept into a smile, eyes widened, and I could swear her pupils began to flicker. I kissed her on the forehead and told her we were going to burn it all down.
 
She had never been to the cabin before, but gained the slightest twinge in her smile and leaned forward in anticipation as we pulled up to the gravel driveway. I turned off my headlights, shut down my engine, and unbuckled my seatbelt. She did the same, and we walked to the slanted building.  She circled around it at first, peering through cracks, studying the roof, counting the windows. Looking through a gap in the paneling, she peered in and sniffed.
 
“You want to go in?” I asked.
“No.” She replied, “I like it from out here. It’s perfect.”
 
The day before, we had grabbed everything we could""everything we remembered anyway. Old trading cards, worn stuffed animals, CDs, a typewriter. Everything. We even folded down the seats to make more room for cargo. Clothes, cameras, photos, jackets, hats, even homework, we piled them all into the back of the car. Anything we found, we took. Our instruments were the hardest. Barbeque fluid, lighter fluid, and three containers of cheap gasoline were our firing pin; old hairspray cans and spray-paint were our shrapnel. When the car was piled high, we headed for the highway.
 
Letter after letter, envelope after envelope, we let them all burn. We littered the house with tiny pieces of ourselves, only to watch them disappear. Each stitch on discarded baseballs slowly burned away, leather browning and stretching, ink sizzling off its face. I watched as my babied steel string acoustic, lightning bolt scratched into the pick guard, slowly twisted and snapped into the flames as if being rung out by something sinister. Keyboards, recorders, guitars, a child’s tambourine""we destroyed them all. All gone, slowly disintegrating into ash and steel. Treasures, trinkets, memories, all burned. Not gone""just repurposed. Into something new. Something fresh. Clean.
 
We didn’t talk much for the rest of the night, just watched. From igniting the first match and seeing it give life to the gasoline trail headed for the house, to following the last roof supports as they crashed downward, we watched from a distance. Dead leaves, frozen pine needles, and dried mud made up our seats""no blankets. We burned those too. We built ourselves a masterpiece from smoke and ash, like an embodiment of the past. Our magnum opus. Our final piece. It was beautiful. That’s how she saw it anyway.

Critique is welcome. ,Batmanabed,3,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/vdeyq/title_just_another_day_in_my_life_critique_is/,"Everyday I wake up and I fail. I am nothing, I am no one. If this wasn't true then wouldn't she love me?  Maybe she could love me like her other children if I was better. I see it in the way her angry dark eyes go Soft when she looks at them. ""One minute sweety, I'm just dealing with your sister."" knowing I was in trouble they'd turn their back and walk away pretending they had no clue. I do not blame them nor hate them. I'm sure I'd do the same. I will stand here and take it so she will not go after them. ""Why can't you do anything good enough? Your siblings are perfect. You are a disease, a burden, worthless."" she spits out every word like a whip lashing across my face. Slowly I nod. Knowing every word she says is true. I see the anger in her eyes flicker. Changing.... She's changing again. The anger turns to weeping. ""Every thing I do is wrong to you. You never accept me. You just push me away over and over. How can I help you if you won't let me! You hurt your dad so much. Broke him. You're the reason he left. It should have been you."" 

     It was my fault he left. I stopped talking then he stopped being a dad. How could I talk to him? Someone so worthless like me being loved by someone so perfect like him. It wasn't fair. Eventually he stopped trying to talk to me. Soon I was nothing to him. Until he left. In my hand he left a note saying "" I love you."" I ripped it up and threw it away. I know the truth. No one could love me. 

      People say school is an escape. They're wrong. I find myself afraid and more self conscious than ever. It's not as if I'm bullied. No I have lots of ""friends"" but non of which actually know me. I put on that happy face and cheery laugh using every bit of energy trying not to fall apart. In my desk I feel the pairs of eyes watching me. I just sit there like the fat cow I am, Tugging down the back of my sweater that I should fit in. Crossing my arms over my disgusting stomach. Their stares are the worst. Gathered into the groups I feel their hot gaze piercing my body, laughing always laughing. Maybe they were talking about me. Maybe not. I look up to notice 15 minutes have gone by. I've missed the lesson being swallowed by my own thoughts. Stupid. This is why my marks went down. I can't help but listen and take part in the conversations that occur in my head. No school is not an escape. The only place I am safe is in my sleep. 

Sleep is my bliss. The only part of the day I look forward to. Maybe one day I will sleep and never wake up. Stuck in a dream forever. One once said ""I cannot face reality so I get lost in my dreams,"" I know this is true. Every word. That surprising considering I don't know much. There was a time when I cared. What changed? Me or her? There were times I would try to go back. Back to how things were. Almost as if another person inhabited my body. A new voice. The younger version of me. Maybe she would love that version.  Nope. Stupid. I feel the skin on my tongue raw and bloody from where I've been biting it. Pain. I deserve it. This is how I get control of my life. The cold metal pressing against my skin was the only thing that cleared my mind. Till she took that from me to. When things get real bad my whole mouth is bloody. That what happens when I think. People get hurt. I try not to think. 

Normal kid. Why cant I be normal. Before I was not close to normal and people knew. Then there was the day I decided to keep it all inside. So much kept inside me driving me to insanity one sentence at a time. Why just the other day a Thought that started out as a simple childhood memory turned to how it Makes complete sense that all human babies are actually grown as oranges. She is right. I am a disease. I will keep it to myself. The less people know the safer they are. They told me to grow up. I tried but how can someone who's past was so wonderful ever look forward at a life of misery and insanity. One day I will be normal. 

   Two of them are gone. Two people who I actually love. They left me here. Yes every once in a while they visit. Those are the best times. I get to actually be considered part of a family. She doesn't come after me when theyre home but when they leave the house goes silent. I love silence. Not this silence. This eerie quietness means she is thinking. Thinking of even flaw I have compared to them. I hear that voice in complete hysteria crying out. ""Why! Why me! I am a good mother! I don't deserve this!"" she is right. Nobody deserves to have me as a burden. 

       Run away. The thought rings through my head over and over again. I know I could but where would I run to. Family? No I've hurt them all. Friends? Nobody falls under this category. No. She would catch me and hate me even more. 

Today I wont eat. Things will be better when I'm skinny. People tell me im thin. I know theyre lying. I can see myself in the mirror. I used to be skinny. When things were better. No today I won't eat but I get there and they are watching my every move. People know if I don't so there I sit stuffing my face with anything to satisfy there stares. I remember the day she found out I didn't eat. ""how much do you weigh? You need help. Anorexic or something!"" Deny. Deny. Deny. Deny everything or loose everything. I tried the whole puking thing. Standing at the top of our hill choking on my fingers and anything else I could shove down my throat. Nothing worked. I even failed at that. When I grow up I won't have to eat. Then I can be skinny. Actually skinny. 

   I'm going home now. Praying no one will be there. Maybe I can be alone. There is the truck. I can feel my heart dropping into my gut, this won't be good. I'll just avoid her for as long as I can. Do my duties, go for a run and then sleep. My feet feel like lead being drug up the steps to the house. Not today please. I can't take it today. Her voice is coming from the kitchen and growing louder. No please no. ""how was your day?"" is this a trick. Another sick game. Stupid Ive taking to long to reply. ""oh so now your not talking to me! I try so hard. Go out of my way to make you happy and this is how you thank me!"" I mumble a short reply. ""I'm sick of this. Your disgusting. "" Her eyes drop in shame for me and she walks away shoulders slumped and head down low. It's a strange thing verbal beatings effect me so much more than any physical. 

   My scratchy coat feels heavy on my shoulders. Tears sting my eyes threatening to pour over. What am I doing? I don't cry. Ever. The image of my dad passes through my mind and my face hardens over again. ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_vdeyq,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/vdeyq/title_just_another_day_in_my_life_critique_is/,
1340022193.0,3,self.shortstories,v7zap,A Cat Named Mouse - Part I,NikolaiRimskyK,4,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/v7zap/a_cat_named_mouse_part_i/,"I have lived here in this old farmhouse for many human years, but the memories of my early days are largely fragmented. My adoptive parents and their child had dubbed me Mouse. While I’m still not entirely certain why they had chosen this name for me, I do have my suspicions. 

I'm getting old now and I don't have the energy to travel about like I once did, searching for life's meaning. The best that I can do is share my experiences, so that others who are seeking the truth may find some answers from the life that I have lived. With the help of Felix’s catnip, I try to tell these stories in the same frame of mind as I was in when the memories were being recorded in my mind. I must however confess; in my youth I was much more vulgar than I am now.
I have had many dreams and revelations during recent nights, which have slowly been unraveling the mystery of my existence. Felix has been doling out well-timed distributions of catnip and I still believe that I am going through a transformation; yet achieving my ultimate desires seems to be eluding me. My dreams are the only methods I have left that allow me to explore. Walking is difficult, my bones ache terribly. I'm plagued by endless exhaustion. Felix has aged more gracefully, not participating in the daredevil escapades that I have. I don't know what I would do without him.

When Felix and I were young, he was taken away from our family and I sunk into a heavy state of depression. The days became long and unbearable. I could only smell the scent of despair; the sweet aromas of pleasant reality would not return until months after my adoption.
For weeks, I would sit perched on the windowsill, fighting to see through the collection of tears, carefully searching for Felix to return, but he never did. My heart was broken and my love for life was torn apart as my best friend vanished from my realm of reality. Fate betrayed me; I thought we had an understanding and the pain I felt from the loss of Felix was unacceptable.

One by one, my brothers and sisters were each taken away by oddly-smelling strangers and their snotty-nosed kids. Each abduction jabbed a splinter into my being, spreading apart my naïve views on life and revealing a darkness over my understandings. Yet none hurt quite as much as the moment I watched helplessly as Felix was stuffed into a tiny cage and carried off. They even took my little red ball.
Time lagged on until it was just mother and me. She did her best to keep my spirits up. I would often awake to her grooming me, keeping me clean and warm as I spent most of my time in a depressive sleep. I would never be cared for like that again.

As the weeks ticked by, I fell into comfort knowing that my birth mother would always be there for me. Then, one cool spring night, as I dozed in and out of wakefulness, listening to the soft rain drumming on the roof, my world became smaller still.

I fought desperately, trying to avoid being stuffed into my own portable jail cell, while my mother hid away under an antique pedestal table, watching on as I too was being abducted. She never said a word. She didn’t even try to stop them from taking her last remaining child. 

I have never cried as much as I did that night, as they took me away from my mother and my home. My cage was placed on the lap of a young boy as the three captors drove their truck away. I was so young and I had no idea where I was being taken to. Even today, I doubt very much that I could ever find my way back to my mother. I had decided in my mind that it is better for me to accept this and yesterday, I held a memorial service for her, finally letting go of all hope from any reunion.

I spent several weeks hiding from the humans in my new prison. Their dog, Jethro really got on my nerves, sticking his nose where it didn’t belong. When the family eventually gave me some privacy and free reign, I spent the time looking out the window, across the yard at their two pigs, Philly and Lilly, who were kept fenced in along the side of a big old red barn. 

Behind the barn, over a dozen chickens played around in the hard dirt that was covered with chicken feed. My depression slowly subsided as I watched Jethro, in his daily ritual, hopping into the chicken cage, chasing them all over the place. His long tongue, hung out of his mouth, flapping around as he ran back and forth. He could never stick to chasing one chicken for very long, as his attention would be grabbed by other frightened chickens running by. They looked terribly afraid.

It had been a long time since I smiled, but my mood was forever tarnished by witnessing the repeated abductions of my siblings and by my own kidnapping. I would never forgive the humans, but that didn’t stop me from wanting to be one of them.

After a couple of months being in confinement within my new adoptive parents’ house, I was finally allowed outside. Their kid, Ricky, was the one who insisted on letting me roam free, but his mom decided I required a harness and a leash. Although embarrassed to be seen by the other animals under control of the humans, I reluctantly agreed to their degrading demands. 

I laid in the grass, next to a stone bird bath in the front yard, I was invigorated by the thousands of different scents. It was so quiet, so peaceful. Everyone was happy, except me. I still had feelings of anger towards the humans, but if I wanted to return to my birthplace, I would need to gain their trust. This turned out to be more difficult than I imagined.

I was allowed outside with Ricky every day and after each excursion, I began to grow fonder of him and his parents. Jethro wasn’t so bad either; he stopped sniffing me so often, giving me a little bit of much needed privacy. I even got to meet Philly and Lilly. They were pretty much stinking idiots and mostly kept to themselves.

Our next door neighbor had an old farmhouse too. He was tall and old. His wrinkles filled up with dirt very quickly, making his face very dark. He spent a lot of time drinking whiskey on his front deck, with his dog named Doug. From what I understood by the other animals’ actions, he and his dog were to be avoided and even Ricky kept away from them.
One day, as I sat outside in the grass, Ricky got permission from Mom to release me from my confines of the metal leash. My heart raced as I was about to realize my newfound freedom. My eyes were opened wide. I perked my ears up to listen to the most optimal direction to flee. Then I heard the click and my harness relaxed around me.

I stood up, completely free, but I couldn’t run. I couldn’t leave another home. I kind of liked it here. Ricky was nice. I even called his parents, Mom and Dad. The other animals made me laugh, a lot and I really needed that. As much as I missed my birth family, I felt accepted here and I couldn’t betray my new family’s trust.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_v7zap,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/v7zap/a_cat_named_mouse_part_i/,
1339646893.0,3,self.shortstories,v1425,The Tin-Man's Lament - By Madylin Duce,madindenial,4,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/v1425/the_tinmans_lament_by_madylin_duce/,"Hello, I am the Tin man. I may not seem like much, just a pile of junk... but do you ever wonder what these folds of scrap hide? In this case, they hide a myriad of horrors and healing. I may not seem like much, but I have stories. I have memories, flaws gained over time. Just like a tree, I may seem inconspicuous and indifferent, but open me up and the rings of time and their scars show. I may not seem like much, but I am me, and to me, that's the world, because it's all I know.  I may not seem like much, but I have much to share.

A while back, there was a storm. Now, this wasn't a scary storm, where the sky is dark and by default you feel dark as well. This was a storm where the rain falls warm, and the sun is still shining, and the rainbows are out, beckoning your smile to come and play. This was a shower where the drops hit the warm cement and you breathe in a scent that is fresh and suffocatingly sweet at the same time. This storm was beautiful and I desired to be a part of it. A corner of my mind told me this wasn't safe, but the rest of me told me to live for the moment, to enjoy life as it comes, and that opportunities never knock twice, so you may as well invite it in. This storm called to me and me alone, for I was all it desired, and all I desired was it. I danced, I sang, I breathed, and I loved every minute of it. There were moments where I would trip up, or sing a sour note, but the gorgeous storm would always continue to embrace me in it's warm shower and love me for my mistakes. I was grateful for that.

Little did I notice an approaching cloud. The sky was darkening, and the storm was getting sadder. Little did I see the cloud's foul intents. All I knew was that this storm was a source of joy for me, and who was I to stop this cloud from feeling this joy too? The cloud inched it's way into the waltz the storm and I shared, and eventually the cloud blocked out all light, and snuffed the beauty of the storm. Overnight the storm became something I worried about... the once attractive storm became cold, and eventually shunned me. I wept.

For a time I died. Not in a literal sense, where one stops breathing, stops functioning physically, and goes cold and rigid in the body. I died in a much more effective way, where one stops feeling, for the pain is so monumental, it blocks out all senses altogether. I died in a way where one stops functioning spiritually, because they simply don't want to. I became cold and rigid in the soul. I rusted, and eventually, even when I wanted to move, I couldn't.

Eventually, I allowed my dear friend time to help me, to oil my joints, to bring me back to life. And as I'm slowly revived by time and it's gentle hands, the rust falls away in gentle flecks that decorate the ground, breadcrumbs left behind, showing where I've been and the lessons I've learned. And while time's remedy is working, I can never be good as new. Just like the tree, the rings of time and gashes in my skin will never disappear, simply be hidden by more. And I will never regret these marks, because they are who I am. I am me, and to me, that's the world, because it's all I know.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_v1425,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/v1425/the_tinmans_lament_by_madylin_duce/,

I felt my legs strapped tightly to what I could only assume to be a chair. My hands were bound behind my back, my movements completely restricted. ""Are you sure we should keep him here? Don't you remember what he is capable of? Especially with what you've done to him,"" said an unknown voice accusingly. 
    
My eyes snapped open as I heard a coarse and familiar voice but I could only see a faint light, something was covering my head. ""Of course I am. There's no way he can take all of us on though."" It was at this point that I grew aware of the rustling of a number of bodies around me. Where am I? 
    
The item covering my head was removed, and as my eyes adjusted to the light, I counted 18 bodies. They must think I'm pretty dangerous, I thought to myself as a smirk took form across my face.
    
""Well, well, well. It has been a while since we've seen each other, hasn't it Mr. Toigo,"" said the familiar voice with a smile. Why do I know that voice? I must have had a puzzled look to my face because he continued saying, “You don’t remember me, do you Mr. Toigo?” I shook my head, as I stared quizzically into his eyes. His grey eyes glared back at me with a look of resentment, yet his unshaven face held a devilish smile. 
    
“Then maybe you’ll remember my brother…” A picture was thrown onto my lap from one of the burly men to my right. A tall lamp stood directly behind him, and as I looked around the room I noticed it’s symmetrical design. Another lamp stood in the exact same spot to my left, just in its mirrored location. Four white walls surrounded the 18 burly bodies around the room. Two mahogany tables lie to either side approximately six feet away, and directly in front of me was the man with the familiar voice, sitting in a steel chair identical to my own. A single unmarked door stood behind him. I looked down at the picture to see a man I remembered instantly, and this recognition transported me to the past.
	
    

My wife, with her beautiful brown hair and stunning figure, sat in the chair across from me as we waited for our names to be called, so that we could collect our beverages from the barista. “I’ve got an order for To-ee-go,” the barista exclaimed. I stood and picked up the hot tea and coffee my wife and I ordered. “It’s toy-go, but thank you,” I laughed as I left him a tip.
    
“Why do they always get it wrong hun?” my wife asked with a giggle. I held the door for her as we exited the coffee shop. The city was busy, pedestrians walking every which way, and we stopped for a second before entering the onslaught of people. As we walked we consumed our drinks and slowly made our way back to my parents house to return to the family reunion they were holding.
    
My eye caught those of a man in a grey hoodie and dark blue jeans before he entered into the alley just ahead of us. I moved my wife to the opposite side, away from the alley. As we passed by, there seemed to be a sudden lull in the people surrounding us. The hooded man appeared and pulled out a gun. I felt my wife’s hand suddenly jolt away from mine as another man grabbed her and held a knife to her neck. We were being jumped.
    
The first man directed the gun towards my head. “Don’t make this more difficult then it has to be, Mr. Toigo,” he stated with the same coarse voice as his brother. How did he know my name? “Release my wife, and I’ll do what you wish,” I said calmly. “Oh! So this is Mrs. Toigo?” he stated as he nonchalantly walked towards her, still aiming the pistol at me. “Let her go, now,” I said, my voice growing more tense. 
    
“Is that attitude in your voice?” Our fellow pedestrians engorged us in a circle about 40 feet in diameter, too afraid to move closer. He pointed the gun at my wife, and she gave a slight exhale of exasperation. My body stiffened with anger at the thought of somebody threatening my wife, my fists clenching in rage. “Let her go now you son of a bitch,” my voice stern and forceful. 
    
“I don’t think I wi-“ was all he managed to get out before I grabbed his shirt and threw him into the alleyway. The gun clanged against the ground as it fell out of his hands. The man holding my wife just stood in shock as I threw my fist into his jaw, breaking it instantly. As he lie writhing in pain on the cement, I stomped my boot into his throat. “Run!” I barked to my wife. She obliged and made a mad dash into the crowd. 
    
The man I threw into the alley had regained his footing, and charged at me as he drew a knife from inside his jacket. As he slashed diagonally at me, I brought my forearm to his, abruptly stopping its progress. In one quick movement, I threw my entire body up under his arm, flipping his body over mine and directly onto the ground. I jumped on top of him and began punching furiously, blood splattering with each point of contact. He lifted his pelvis into the air, knocking me off balance as he simultaneously drove the knife into my thigh. 

I grunted as it entered my leg, but I still managed to regain my balance, and tear the knife from my thigh before throwing it across the sidewalk. I raised to my feet and grabbed the breast of his hoodie, seizing him into the air, leaving his feet dangling inches from the ground. I back-peddled into the alley, before quickly spinning and launching the man into the nearby dumpster. 
    
I backed into a parking meter as I watched the man attempt to regain his footing, before stumbling back onto the ground. I looked at his companion who was still unconscious. I heard a gasp from the crowd and my eyes darted back to my attacker as he aimed and fired his pistol. I felt the bullet enter my abdomen, but instead of toppling over in pain, I merely yelled as I felt an extreme amount of adrenaline course through my body. My body seemed to react on its own, turning towards the parking meter. With super-human strength I ripped it from the ground and threw it like a javelin directly at the man’s chest. I heard bones crack and saw blood spew from his mouth, but I wasn’t finished with him yet. He attempted to crawl away, but to no avail, as I walked towards him, my veins pulsing with adrenaline. My hands grasped the parking meter as I brought it down upon his back. Both his spine and the parking meter shattered and I could all but see him struggling just to stay alive, but he threatened my wife. I wasn’t done with him yet. 
    
I threw away my weapon, and flipped my attacker over so that his anterior faced me. My hand grabbed his face, and I lifted him into the air easily with my newfound strength. His face expressed that he was clearly struggling just to breath, but I just said with a forceful tone, “I warned you, you son of a bitch.” With all of my strength I smashed his head into the wall, and upon impact I felt his skull crush in my hands. He was gone.




“Yes I remember your brother,” I said to the man after the flashback ended.

For three months, she held onto that bright purple monkey that he had gotten her for her birthday and waited. Why had he gotten her a purple monkey anyway? She hated the color purple.

The really sad thing was, she felt almost relieved. And she was disgusted with herself for that.

They had met in a book club meeting, of all places. Freshman year of high school, she walked into the library, still painfully shy, and he was the first one who said hi to her. There were only ten people in the club, and she slowly relaxed around them. They argued over their favorite novels, had contests to see who could read the next assigned book the fastest and made up a secret handshake that, when they tried to perform it in the hallways between classes, always ended in loud laughter.

He had been in three of her classes, which she had never noticed before, and they started hanging out more. When he asked her out, she was so excited, and terrified. She had never had a boyfriend before. Was she supposed to act different around him now? Was she supposed to stop hanging out with him as much? How many texts a day were too many? She didn't worry for too long. He was just as nervous as she was. They spent almost every moment together, those first two years.

Then junior year rolled around and he became distant. He tried to make an effort to stay cheerful around her, but she had known him long enough to see that he was unhappy. She tried talking to him, but he would shake his head and turn away and she didn't push.

She had wondered if he was going to break up with her, and cried. One night, while they were watching a movie together, she turned and looked at him, her eyes filling with angry tears and demanded that he just do it already. She couldn't handle this anymore.

He hugged her, squeezed her as tight as he could, and said that he wasn't going to break up with her. He loved her. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. But the rest of his life was three months, maybe four.

They had cried together, and talked, and cried some more. They spent two days apart, because she didn't know how to handle it. But she decided that she would keep him happy for the next three months. He would never have to worry about her leaving him.

Those three months were the worst. He got weaker. He got more emotional. He would lash out for no apparent reason and once, when she told him to relax, he hit her in the face. She was more angry than hurt. ""Just because you're dying doesn't mean you get to hit your fucking girlfriend!"" She had left, and he called her that night, sobbing and apologizing. She went back to his house and spent the night lying next to him in bed, unable to sleep, listening to his mom cry in the living room.

The phone rang. She answered it on the third ring.

""He wants to see you.""

She was silent for a few moments. ""I can't. I can't do that.""

""Stop being selfish. I don't care if it scars you for life, get your ass to the hospital. For some reason, my boy wants to see you before he dies and you'd better fucking do what he wants.""

She hung up and got out of bed. She brushed her hair and put it up, remembering that he always said she looked cute with a ponytail. She put on the shirt he liked the most and a pair of jeans that he had doodled on one day in book club. She drove to the hospital slowly and carefully, parked in the farthest spot from the door. It was windy out, and smelled like it was about to rain. The woman at the front desk directed her to the right room and she went, trying to get lost along the way. It didn't work. The building was too small.

She opened the door marked 318 and everyone in the room turned to stare at her. His mother and father were there. His mother glared at her, but his father smiled. His older brother was there, sitting in the only chair, looking exhausted. And there he was, sitting up in bed, grinning at her.

His father ushered everyone else out of the room to give them privacy. As the door closed, she perched on the side of the hospital bed and took his hand.

""Hey.""

He kissed her hand and she smiled. ""Hi. I'm glad you came.""

""Of course I came."" She felt like crying, but refused to. He didn't need that. ""This is a much better reason to put off studying for finals.""

He laughed, but it sounded off. ""You know, I was always amazed that you stuck around. After everything, you're still here. That means the world to me. I love you.""

""I love you too."" The lie tasted bitter, but she ignored it. They said nothing else to each other. His family returned and she stayed where she was, holding his hand, until he finally closed his eyes and went.

She felt suddenly as if someone had reached into her chest and pricked her heart, letting the blood drain out until it shriveled and died. She left the hospital. She attended the funeral. She finished high school and moved to another state. She went to college, tried to make new friends and have new relationships. She left college, found an okay job, and started dating her next door neighbor. He was an alcoholic, which she didn't mind. He hit her sometimes. She just covered it up with make-up and he never remembered the next morning. He proposed to her and she agreed. They had three children and she quit her job.

She wasn't happy. She hated the children. She hated her husband. She blamed it all on him, the first boy she had ever loved, who had promised her so much and then left her. She was heartless and unlovable because of him. She was depressed because of him. She wished she hadn't lied to him. He should have died knowing that she didn't love him anymore.

She sent the kids off to school, kissed her husband before he left for work, wrote a note and stuck it on her pillow, and decided to go for a walk. She kept walking, until she was so sore that she had to stop. She sat down on the side of a road she didn't recognize and smiled to herself, thinking that she had finally managed to get lost.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_uiwn2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/uiwn2/lost/,

“You better be happy or else!""

Those words ran through Charlie's head constantly. The worst part was that the words came from a girl at work. A cute one at that. The way she said it made Charlie wonder if she actually cared for his well being or that negativity was her pet peeve. It wasn't his fault he saw the world in different colours. Then again....

They both stood idley. Charlie was about to start his shift, and the girl was about to leave.

“I want to see you more happy man."" She said again. Charlie nodded and smiled. He wasn't sure if he was blushing or not, but he hoped he wasn't. When the girl left to head home, Charlie had a moment to process what happened. He easily brought up memories of his ex because she too was obsessed with being positive. Just thinking about it made him sick to his stomach. Just thinking of her with another guy....

So he chucked that thought aside like a crumpled peice of paper entering a garbage can. “This is who I am."" he said to himself. Sure he had his happy moments, but if he knew anything, it was that with his happy moments their was always room for despair. Always.

Charlie gazed at the girl as she left to  see her boyfriend at home. Then he looked at his arm which showed visible scars of self mutilation. “Who would want me anyways...."" he said as he turned back into the store.

And he went to work.

This was not one of those times,” Alex began softly, his eyes vacant as he tried to count the number of dots in the fiberboard ceiling tiles.

 

“In fact, as I lowered my gaze across the sprawling red-oak conference table I found my eyes resting upon a slack-jawed tenth grader who has developed a habit of making his instructors cry – precisely the last problem I needed to deal with this Friday,” he paused for effect, but Dean Fisher would deny him the satisfaction of acknowledgement while he scribbled in his notes.

 

“We sat in silence for what seemed like hours before I could reconcile what had to be done. Alex Decker would have to be put to death-“

 

“Thank you, Mr. Decker, but I have my own inner monologue to narrate, and it does not need any coercion into murdering a student of Williamson High School.”

 

The room was still. Dean Fisher was not a man who physically commanded respect, but he had a gift for declaring things with authority. The room remained still until Dean Fisher removed his reading glasses and put down his crossword puzzle.

 

Alex raised an eyebrow.

 

“Mr. Decker,” Dean Fisher let the name roll off his tongue as if he were trying it out for the first time, “Why are you making my employees cry?”

 

Alex resumed counting fiberboard dots.

 

“Mrs. Clemens won’t actually tell me what you said or did to her...”

 

Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one…

 

“…this makes it hard for me to administer discipline.”

 

Thirty-one…wait, shit.

 

“But of course you know that. But what you didn’t know is that Daphne Clemens took her own life thirty minutes ago at her home in Clarksville.”

 

Alex felt the words hit him at once, sending his stomach plummeting to the center of the universe.

 

“She…what?” His lips were numb as he formed the words.

 

“She offed herself! No note, no nothing. Nobody knows what to make of it.”

 

“I…I don’t even know what to-“

 

“Okay, I’m fucking with you, Alex.  But for the love of god you have to stop calling your instructors fat.”

 

The relief rolled over Alex’s body in waves and he sunk into the leather armchair feeling both emancipated and savagely exploited.

 

“I didn’t call her fat; I didn’t call her anything.”

 

“You replaced her birthday cake in the faculty lounge with a replica that read “Congratulations on your thirty-five year pregnancy.”

 

“I want my lawyer.”

 

“You’re fifteen.”

 

“Touche,” Alex shrugged and sunk back into the armchair.

 

Dean Fisher studied the boy carefully.

 

“Dean Fisher studied the boy carefully. He definitely had to be assassinated-“

 

“Get out of my office, Alex.”

 

Alex stood, gathering his books and slinging his book bag over one shoulder lazily. At the door he spun on his heels, nonchalantly tossing a polished, delicious red apple towards his administrator.

For five days we sat in our trench with no cloths and no food.  The only water we had on hand was a thermos full of goat urine (surprisingly tasty).  Early one morning on the sixth day we heard a great rumbling sound from far way.  slowly it came closer, like ancient gods riding their chariots of thunder.  At first I thought it was a storm (as is common that time of year) but then I remembered that there is no weather in the arctic, it had to be something else.  As I looked up I saw the Red Barron pass over head.  He was flying low and fast, behind him a large black cloud that seemed to be pursuing his biplane.  I have never seen a look of fear as the one I saw on the faces of the Nazis as they retreated back in to the shadows, seemingly to flee from the black mass that was encompassing the sky.  “Whats happening?”  I yelled at a German straggler.  He turned around, in a soft voice he simple said “Heuschrecke”, and followed his companions back in to the woods.  What was this great mass?  This living being that the imposing Third Reich soldiers seemed to fear so much?  Quickly I pulled out my phone and began to translate the word that the German soldier had said to me.  Slowly, my trembling fingers typed out the letters as the dark cloud inched closer.  “H”, another inch “E”, another “u”, almost on top of me now.  My hands warmed up and I managed to type all the way to “ck”.  That’s when I heard my comrades call out in pain.  A terrible agonizing scream that still haunts me to this day.  The sun was completely obscured now, my phone was the only remaining source of light.  With out thinking my thumb fell on the “e” button.  The word “Heuschrecke” was now complete.  My eyes looked down with bewilderment, Google translate simply said “grasshopper”.  Heuschrecke meant Grasshopper.  Now it all made sense, this cloud, this great black mass was a swarm of hungry grasshoppers looking for food.  How hungry?  I was about to find out.  My friends screamed at first But their screams where in vain.  The swarm filled their mouths, grasshoppers poured down their lungs, cutting of air supply.  I managed to survive by keeping my mouth closed and using their limp body’s as protection from the malnourished mass of bugs.  Five days later I was found in a field out side of West Berlin and subsequently returned home.

***House of Ypres***

Everything was falling apart; the walls were melting, the roofs were blown away, the ground was littered with decaying wood and the scent of burning flesh. The scene was devastating for all those who would come across it in the near future – though I didn’t suspect that anyone would vacation here anytime soon. I just sat there dumbfounded, and staring at the destroyed surroundings that vaguely resembled the life I had just yesterday. However fate was cruel, and so were the Angels.

As I sat there on the verge of tears there was a noise. It was a soft, faint wailing coming from somewhere nearby. I could almost pinpoint the direction but the noise was far too quiet for me to be exact, so I just started walking in the approximate area of the sad sound. The noise stopped and I was about to turn around and start looking elsewhere until it started again.


Maybe I shouldn’t say it started *again*. This noise was so completely different than the soft cries I heard just moments ago. This sound was terrifying and ear-piercing, and it almost seemed to be saying *hurry, why is it taking so long for you to find me?* Suddenly all my senses were sharp and strong and now the location of the loud, urgent sound became obvious. I rushed over to a pile of wood that had somehow managed to escape unburned, but torn beyond repair. I moved the top wooden plank and a bright lighted shined up at my unsuspecting face.


This light was violet and warm. It reminded me of the caring embrace of a loved family member after not having seen each other for a long period of time.
     

“What in the world…” I trailed off as the light shone brighter and started to move. It began to stir and shift as if it were some living creature that the light had created, and as it turns out, it was. A little silver feline with a black tipped tail emerged, and when it was completely free it jumped off of the pile of rubble and sat on the packed dirt. It looked at me simply, as if it hadn’t just come out of a floating ball of purple light. I turned my attention back to the light – and rightly so for it began to move, rising upwards until it was at eye level with me. Out of nowhere, and without any warning signs, the light flared up to what I had to assume was full brightness, and then started fading until it had fully disappeared.
     

Totally stunned and unsure of how to proceed, I turned to the little silver cat who was still staring at me as if it were expecting something. This was all too weird so I had decided to start walking. I didn’t have anywhere to go and I didn’t even know which direction was north, but I didn’t really care.  I just wanted to be anywhere but here. Everyone I knew and everything I cherished had been blown to smithereens.
     

I walked through a puddle, and heard something splash through it, a few paces behind me. With liquid rimming my eyes I turned around and furiously stomped my way over to the fragile looking animal that was no more than five feet away from me. With each footstep a cloud of dust surrounded my feet, and when I came to a stop, the dust settled.
     

“What do you want from me, huh?” I practically screamed at the cat. “I can’t feed you or take care of you. I don’t even know what you are! So stop following me!”
     

I had to stop, take a breath, and wipe away the tears that had fallen without my permission. I knew that the poor cat had nothing to do with the current circumstances of my village or myself but I needed someone or something to blame, something to scream at. *I just need someone to tell me that this feeling won’t last forever and that things will go back to normal soon*, I thought.
     

“So basically you want someone to lie to you,” the cat responded in a somewhat uninterested fashion.
     

“That’s not what I mea—” I stopped abruptly. That cat just *responded* to me. What’s more, it responded to my *thoughts*. It took everything I had not to pass out right then and there; I even grabbed my stomach thinking that I was definitely going to lose my lunch.
     

“Oh stop being a wuss,” it mumbled under its breath. “My name is Sinister and I am one of the most highly respected female felines in the Kingdom.
     

My head was spinning out of control; I had lost my tongue, and my ability to move and everything seemed so far away. I was too confused, too stunned by all of this that I couldn’t function in the slightest.
     

“What’s wrong?” Sinister asked chuckling to herself. “Cat got your tongue?”
     

Somehow that tasteless joke was what triggered my body to start again, though I was still a little shaky.
     

“I’m dreaming,” I said softly. “That’s all.”
     

“Oh, c’mon,” she chimed, “A dream? That’s so cliché. No dear, I’m real, and so are the Angels who sent me.”
     

“Angels?” my head perked up. Finally something familiar, something I knew, although it wasn’t necessarily a good thing. The Angels are evil. *They bombed my village*, I thought angrily.
     

“No, no, no,” she shook her head furiously. “You better be careful what you think dear, they hear it all.”
     

I turned and started walking again. I didn’t care what ‘they’ heard, I was angry and broken and I would think whatever I wanted. Besides it would be indecent to look into others thoughts.
     

“The Angels who sent me are the real Angels,” Sinister continued. “The ‘Angels’ here are nothing but humans with unique powers that create chaos and destruction and pass themselves off as immortals. It wasn’t a bad idea, only now the real Angels are upset.”
     

For the umpteenth time today I was completely lost. The real Angels? There’s only one group of Angels, they ruled this place, and they’re evil. I thought I was so sure about this fact, so why did I suddenly doubt what I knew? I sat down on the hard ground and leaned on the side of a house that now, literally, only had one side.
     

“Listen, that purple ball of light wasn’t just light, it was power,” she said quickly, obviously taking advantage of the doubt that she most definitely read in my thoughts. “I came out of it but I’m not the only thing it was carrying. They gave you a gift.”
     

“No, they gave me a talking, mind-reading cat,” I threw back at her.
    

“They gave you an *intelligent*, talking, mind-reading cat,” she corrected. “And that’s not all they gave you. I said the light was power, don’t you want to know where that power disappeared to?”
     

I didn’t. I really didn’t want to know any more than I already did. This was far too much for me to handle alone – but who would I tell? Nothing was normal anymore, so maybe it would be better to adapt. I was also a little curious. I shook my head.
     

“Where did it go?” I asked, clearly not actually wanting an answer.
     

“The power went into you,” she said softly as if not to break the thin layer of calm that I wrapped around myself, and she was right to do so.


I froze, also afraid of disturbing not only my mask of calm but my sanity which was currently hanging in the balance. *Power?* I thought, *but why?*


At this the cat flicked her tail and gave me a smile that made me understand exactly why they called her Sinister, “For revenge of course.”

I was basically a Freudian therapist's sloppy wet dream. With the early age of the internet at my disposal and a rapidly developing lust with no sexual outlet (due to the fact that my mother fixed my hair for me in the morning and that's just not what a girl's looking for in her first sex partner) rivaling that of a serial rapist, a sixth sense had evolved in me that could sniff out pornography like a fucking hunting dog. 
 
My brother and I had a tradition of spending every Saturday night at my grandmother's. Legos. Mystery Science Theater 3000. Breakfast. Yard Sales. It was kind of a big deal. Just the most fun. The next morning, she'd make her way to the local grocery store to shop for breakfast acquisitions for the three of us. I'd had some suspicions about my grandmother's fast and loose nature in her younger years from fleeting comments that she'd made (referring to a series of wigs in her bedroom as 'bar bait' for instance). Therefore, I figured that a woman with such an insatiable sexual appetite must have a healthy collection of pornography at any age. A thorough search of her closet was called for while she was out, and I enlisted my brother as a lookout.
 
What we discovered in my 60-year-old grandmother's closet can't be described using traditional vernacular. It was the holy grail of pornography. El Dorado. The joy that swept through us surely beared some semblance to the elation that the team discovering King Tut's tomb had felt. Over the course of two months, I took every last fucking piece. Smuggled it out of her house VHS by VHS in the gay little blue ""Going To Grandma's!"" suitcase I'd bring along for our sleepovers. Which is also not what a girl's looking for in her first sex partner. Needless to say, we pulled the wool over her eyes pretty hardcore and I maintain a small pang of guilt because of it. But shit, bitch. It was an entire closet of hardcore pornography. What was I to do?
 
I learned some really disturbing things about my grandmother from that experience. Memories that I can't erase. Aside from the fact that it was largely porn from the 70's and 80's, which is essentially just grainy shots of matted clumps of fur bouncing off one another (explosively impressive mustaches buried in a jungle of pubic hair), her collection was alarmingly heavy in the hermaphrodite respect, which I wanted no part of. I was weird. But not that weird. I don't judge. Hey, I'm into some weird stuff, too. Must be genetic. She was also holding a lot of interracial gems too which was curious because she'd always been, well, kind of a racist. In a really sweet, older lady kind of way though. So I started selling the porn I didn't want and gradually became the Larry Flynt of my middle school. I kind of made bank for a seventh grader with no vehicle or job, not gonna lie. Money I used entirely on 90's PC adventure games, perpetuating a cycle of social exclusion.
 
On that infamous day in question, the memory of which still haunts me, the father of one of my high profile clients discovered his son's lunch money purchases in his backpack one day. Some pretty fucking ball-slapping filth. He always wanted the worst of the worst. His dad turned up the heat on him and he squealed like a pig, revealing his dirty, dirty source. Imagine that! It turns out to be the pale, chubby weirdo wearing shirts that are too big for him. I was being profiled, I'm sure of it. I was thrown to the academic wolves and forced to confess to my parents that I'd been smuggling interracial 70's hermaphrodite porn from my grandmother's trailer for months and peddling it during passing periods. That's a difficult one to live down. I should probably be on some kind of public listing for it, really.

She stood, so still beside the window that anybody walking past would have thought she was a statue. She watched the world amble by, lazily gliding along as if nothing bad ever happened in this city, nothing ever made anybody hurt. It came boiling up inside her, a rage so intense she felt her heart was on fire, how could this happen to her?! Why was she the only one who seemed to have real emotions?


Two weeks before this moment, Valerie had been sitting on the underground, making her way around sharp bends, bumps and jolts until the train slid from one stop to the next, her stomach getting tighter with each rock of the carriage and nausea waving over her with each rise and fall of the tunnel. The approach into Mile End Station went on forever, what was supposed to last around one minute felt like an hour. When she stood up the waves of fear swept over her. She hesitated. James grabbed her hand and pulled her forward,
“Come on Val, we’ll miss our appointment.”
She shook her head as though coming round from a trance, and stepped off the train following a thousand other people, like ants marching to their nest with armfuls of food.
Breaking through the hordes the winter ice stung her eyes, caught in her throat and tickled her petite round nose. Her blonde curls bounced as she walked as if they had some kind of false optimism, buther curvy, petite body screamed,

 ‘YOU DON’T WANT TO DO THIS!’

The voice inside her drowning to a whisper when she saw the hospital. Her stomach tightened, the building, emblazoned in what once seemed regal gold lettering, became sinister and overwhelming.

‘THE ROYAL LONDON HOSPITAL’

Valerie didn’t want to do it, she’d convinced herself that she could go without knowing, and live happily ever after, maybe it would happen, but James and she both knew that it wasn’t the truth. 

Inside there was a small coffee machine, and a few other tearful couples, a few smiling with relief, it was as though they were segregated. All happy people to the left, all the sad to the right, and dead ahead the door, that hid the room she dreaded so much. She wanted to run away. Valerie sat in the waiting room feeling numb, she looked at James, he seemed so vulnerable yet so strong all at once, this struck at her curiosity and she found herself staring at him, watching how his face held that fake smile, how his body language showed how uncomfortable he was, in that moment she knew he felt exactly the same as she did. At least that’s what she thought at the time.

A smiley nurse walked out of the office behind her, 

“Mr and Mrs Slant?”
The optimism she heard in that nurse’s voice filled her with hope and she prayed to the very bottom of her heart that it was good news.

“I’m so sorry,” 
Those three little words, made Valerie numb. A burning hot poker had pierced her heart and her fat hot tears almost burnt as they traced their way through the powder on her face. Churning the words over in her mind, seeing a lifetime of memories that hadn’t even happened yet, Valerie thought to herself ‘well fuck your I’m so sorry, how would you know?’ 

In a single moment she had found out that she would never be a mother, she would never smell the fragrance of her new born, never hold her own flesh and blood to her skin, or be able to laugh when her baby was sick down daddy’s shirt, even see her child go to school, talk to her teenager about relationships, or even wear a big floppy hat at her babies’ wedding.The news hit her full force as if somebody had repeatedly slapped her around the face.

Two days later, lying in bed she rolled over to find James’s side of the bed cold, a note on his pillow read;

‘I can’t do this, I can’t be without a family.’

Not even a sorry, no goodbye, not even a thought that she might feel that way too. Of course, he could do something about it and he had done just that, he’d left her on her own, to be a lonely spinster, baron and useless. 

That whole few days played over and over in her mind, like a reel of film that just never ended. The banging on the door startled her out of the trance. She came to and realized she had been standing at the window for well over an hour, people walking past must have thought she was crazy. She sighed and dragged herself to the door and positioned herself behind the peephole. Annabelle. Valerie had only opened the door a few inches when her mad little, but then again not so little, sister burst in.

“I’m going to Cornwall for a few days!” Annabelle squealed with excitement.

“That’s nice,” Standard reply number one. Valerie had switched off, using a set of replies that made it seem like she was listening. She really didn’t want to see anyone right now, she was certain her body language screamed that. Her little sister, ‘Annie’ as she called her rattled on and on about this village they used to go to on holiday.

“…and you’re coming with me. That’s final”

“Oh.” Out came standard replynumber two.

“Oh? What does that mean? are you coming or not?!” Annabelle asked, a tone of agitation in her voice.

“Sure.” Standard Reply Number Three.

“You’ll come? I’m so excited we will have to get packing and then book a …” Annie went off again on a tangent, Valerie needed to be anywhere but here right now, in her modern, white walled, height of fashion, perfect little palace.

 	The man awoke, startled as if from a nightmare, yet he recalled no dreams. He sat up and took stock of the 

blank room he found himself in. There was a shattered mirror set on a table to his right. A large door could be 

found opposite his bed, intact, with the exception of a large gash in the wood where all the light in the room

 seeped from. The most curious object however, was a rather bland looking table with three drawers. It was 

approximately 2 feet long and just as wide, with enough height that a chair could be pulled up and an average 

sized man could uncomfortably sit. He stiffly shuffled to the mirror. Upon inspection he could see that he was only

 lightly wounded, a few scratches on his face, a  laceration above his eyebrow and a lightly blackened eye. What 

really caught his attention though was the amount of stubble visible at least 3 days worth. The man had no 

recollection of even coming to this room, let alone having been here for more than a few hours. That’s when it hit 

him. He didn’t remember much at all. He reached into the pits of his mind, trying to drag out even the most 

superfluous details. Nothing. Not even a date. He made his way to the table, his joints groaning from the 

movement, whether from over or under use the man couldn’t say. The rightmost drawer opened easily enough, 

revealing a note. After close scrutinization he determined the note to befit the work of either . It read: “My 

sanctum, my home. Ye come, I go. Divinity’s blessing, upon us all. Beware, take stock, heed my thoughts, away, 

away we go. Learn not what passes, yet to all be keen. My heart, for all within, bleeds.”

So I dozed off for who knows how long.
 
Thanking the train attendant, I hastily shove the Palahniuk book into my worn out CaPerro handbag. The train, which was awfully vacated from the start, is now quietly empty. There is one old guy dressed in cargo green still sitting in his seat at the end of cabin two. He seems to be asleep, and the attendant makes her way to wake him up. Did I look like that before she woke me up? I don't know. I don't think I'd like to bother her for such a trivial matter, either.
 
The sky is painted a somber grey. It's still drizzling lightly outside, so I put on my leather beret and tighten my jacket straps. As the soles of my shoes crunch on the damp ground, the smell of rain soaking in caresses me and my footsteps softly.
 
 
I once learned from a book that the smell is called petrichor. And like that smell, your smile under the two-year-old August rain still mystifies what's left of me until this day.

I watch a single drop streak down the glass and try not to wonder why I have this feeling of shame gnawing at my stomach. 
	
""Hey you alright bud?""

My head bounces gently on the window. It's not nearly as uncomfortable as the overwhelming sense of contempt that's boiling in my blood. Not for any one thing in particular, save perhaps myself and whatever misdeeds I committed tonight, but for all things. 

The other passengers are silent now. I listen to the wipers scrape across the windshield. My mouth is dry and stale from cheap beer. I'm not nauseous, but I want to vomit up every last thing I have, to spew out everything toxic inside of me on side of the road.

A kerosene stove hissed gently nearby. Drops of last night’s rain had frozen on my sleeping bag and cracked softly as I withdrew.  My fingers thawed on a bowl of half-blackened soup that tasted like coal and burnt plastic. Then we left, and my headlamp blew out mercury bubbles of light against the ash and cobalt sky. 


I was already scraping my feet against rock and climbing up towards the tree line by the time the orange ribbons cut the sky. I watched the day rise slowly up from behind the white-tipped mountains. It was giving me something I could look back on and say I had lived. The morning, with dawn and its sharp spikes of numbing cool, and my eyes, and the whole wide world: they were all so strong just then. The cold made me burn hotter and faster and better and it made my breath curl into  vanishing clouds. My feet were ready to etch the memory of me onto this mountain.


The last green thing was a calm lake at the foot of a white and rocky mountain. It was the last innocent thing before the peak. We left a few things and then continued on. The trail we had followed disappeared into scree and so we followed the stream up. We stopped where the incline leveled out into a rocky bowl and filled a bottle with cold stream water. We treated it with a few drops of yellow, finger-staining iodine. I saw the small and brave flowers, yellow and pink, that sprouted timidly on the rocky ground around the river.


We hiked up through snow to the sharp ridge of the bowl. All around was an algae that turned the snow crimson when stepped on. I looked back on my footprints and saw they were scarlet. I felt as if I were walking on a thin film that had been cast to disguise a sea of blood. The soles of my shoes soon became blood red and so did my pants. We all looked like murderers.


 The next thing that lay between the peak and us was a narrow strip of snow that marked the end of the bowl and the beginning of the peak. On one side the snow sloped sharply down into the bowl. On the other was nothing except air and then distant trees and rock and ice-blue lakes far below. We stayed towards the bowl side because the side of the ridge facing the drop was likely hollowed out by the wind and melting snow. Even then, I felt as though the snow beneath me would collapse and I would be swept out into the air. 


The peak was somewhere up a tower of jumbled-up rock. There was a path that led up and we followed it. The jumble narrowed in one spot and the path led to a ledge at the very edge of the rock jumble and there was a drop that would kill me if I fell. I had to cling to the rock with my feet in a six-inch-wide shelf and shuffle carefully along. I looked up as I was nearly to the end and there was a spider an inch from my hand. I do not know if it was deadly. It might have been. If I had been afraid of spiders, I would have let go in fright. The jagged rocks below me would have broken me apart.


The peak came quickly after that. There was not much room, but I could sit on a rock and open the metal ammunition canister with the register in it, and sign my name and the date, and write some bad poetry next to it. But I did write something true there. I wrote I am above, on a line by itself, and that rang true. I was strung up so that all the craftwork of the earth could be seen. Cold wind blew around me and I had left my warm clothes at the lake below, but it meant nothing more to me than any of the cold winds I remembered. It was as though I had already lived through it a long time ago.


The view had the clarity that comes after a rain, with the whites and greens and cold greys of the country before me both softened and sharpened at once, and the mountains and valleys fading to pale blue as they approached the pastel clouds over the horizon. I was sitting on the jagged throne of the universe, and all that was before me was mine now, mine and no one else's, because I was the only person alive, had only ever been the only person alive, and that feeling did not make me feel lonely or frightened, but instead young and filled with life that would never fade or dissipate but stay collected until the electric reservoir in my veins finally ran dry.

The car smashes against my body and my body against the car, as much as a car would care about a few hundred pounds of flesh, water, and crunchy bits stuff in an odd looking package whacking against it‘s metal construction.  My gut immediately registers the damage, followed by the quick and utter collapse of my spleen.  I’m fairly certain it was my spleen at least,  I am not horribly good at anatomy and a car crash seems an inappropriate time for brushing up on the subject.  The fact I am broken is quite clear, if not from the pain, then perhaps from the blood exiting my body from the hole in my stomach or perhaps the blood spraying on my vehicular executioner when I cough. The car stopped.  Did I mention the car stopped?  The driver sure was nice to stop for me.  Would have been nicer if it occurred before I started bleeding, but it’s the thought that counts.  Oh god, it hurts.  I’m supposed to be in shock.  When you get hit by a car and have a giant hole in your stomach, you get to go to your happy place where all the Playboy bunnies bring me drinks and tell me how I was always better than Hugh, but I can still feel the pain.  There isn’t pain at the Playboy Mansion, but I’m not at the Playboy Mansion.  I’m in the middle of the street.  I’m in the middle of the street and I’m dying.  I can see people around me, sirens in the distance.  I wonder if they will save me.  I think the man who hit me is standing over me but everything is a bit blurry.  I would try to talk but my body has prioritized coughing up blood ahead of casual conversation.

The man leans over me and I think he is smiling.  He can’t be smiling.  He hit me with a car.  He doesn’t get to smile.  I don’t care if I was an idiot for cross the street when there was traffic, you don’t get to smile at me!  The sirens have gone silent.  Did I go deaf? I’m losing my grasp on everything.  Ah.  I see the shock has kicked in and I don’t feel anything now.  I can’t hear, I can’t feel, and unless it became night really quickly I think I might be losing my vision.  My body doesn’t want me to know I’m dying.  It doesn’t want to die.  I don’t. I don’t want to die.  I just keep thinking…keep thinking…I remember now.

Their ponies paced onwards, heads bent in exhaustion. They were following a hard packed trail to somewhere, for now only deeper into the cliffs. The water was gone, the food was gone, but not the gold.

“Ey’ Billy, see that crag some way up?” The grizzled man called Desmond was gesturing ahead. A dozen feet from the valley floor was a shadowed crack in the rock face. It was perhaps large enough for a boy to squeeze into, and out of sight. 

“I do Sir,” said Billy. He wiped his forehead with his sleeve; this heat was something from a nightmare. Thinking how close they had come to going home, he could cry. A month of panning in the Rio del Oro had yielded them a nugget of gold worth thousands. Billy could have bought his Mama a ranch, and for all his brothers and sisters. He remembered smiling at the thought of being a hero.  

That all changed when they were ambushed during the night at their river-camp. The group fought for their lives and fired wildly into the dark. Five of the original eight escaped into the desert, carrying with them whatever had been strapped to their ponies. After two days of pursuit across hell they came to a valley. “No man’s fortune is his own in the West,” Desmond had said, before leading them onwards.

Now the group moved towards the crag, and stopped. Desmond helped Billy upwards and into the shadow. He handed him one of their two remaining rifles. “Stay quiet, wait till you see em’ coming round the bend. Then start pickin em’ off! We’ll be a bit ahead ready to ambush.” Desmond gave the boy a rickety-smile and a half-filled canteen he had hidden away. 

Billy watched the rest of the men ride around a bend and disappear. Then he gulped the canteen, curled into the shade to wait, and sobbed. 

The sun was setting, the group made it about a mile since they had left Billy. Desmond suddenly exclaimed in anger as he looked ahead. The walls of the valley rose upwards, and then joined together, it was a dead-end. The other three men murmured, frightened. Desmond took off his old sombrero and trailed a hand through his grey hair, ripe with sweat. 

What was his plan now? They were outgunned, and he had left Billy behind as a distraction, hoping the boy would be trigger-happy. Thoughtfully, he reached into his satchel he rubbed a dense rawhide bundle. Then turning his pony to the remaining men, a troop of dusty Spaniards, he withdrew the bundle and opened it. They all managed a smile as the fat lump of gold gleamed in the shadowed valley. 

“Como el sole,” said one of the Spaniards. 

“El sole,” the rest agreed. 

A breeze crept forth from where they had come, cooling them all for a moment. Just then came a crack, like a rock dropped from above, and then another, and then a whole succession. Gunfire, it danced among the rock walls. 

Desmond dropped from his mount, and walked to the end of the valley. Two of the Spaniards drew revolvers and the last had a rusted pistola. They crowded behind a red-rock boulder, preparing their weapons. In the shadows of the towering rocks, Desmond was busy digging a hole, laughing the whole time.

Baby Ray
Raymond was my little brother. We called him Baby Ray until he was old enough to tell us to shut up, and after that we just called him Ray. The same year Ray was born my parents got us a dog. A huge Bernese mountain dog named Theodore. 

Theodore was the coolest dog ever. He grew to mammoth proportions, but when he was a puppy people used to think he was a stuffed animal. Without a doubt, that dog was the motherfuckin’ bee’s-knees. He was the smartest dog I ever met. I know everyone thinks that their dog is the best, but Theodore really was. Ray used to ride atop him like he was a horse, pulling his ears like they were reigns and screaming with laughter. I swear he understood English perfectly. We would ask him, “Where’s Mom?” and he’d lead us right to her. It even seemed like he understood the jokes we made, howling along with my brother and I as we laughed at whatever stupid joke the other had made. 

Walking Theodore was considered to be a “chore”, but my brother and I both enjoyed the activity. We’d switch off days of the week for who got to walk him. It was my favorite part of the day. Just me and Theodore, walking down the street. Straight chillin’. When Ray and I got older we would roll up little joints and walk Theodore to the woods. Once we were there, we’d smoke and take him off the leash. While we lazily strolled around the woods, Theodore would run ahead. He never went far though, always waiting for us and staying within eyesight. Whenever we got a bit too baked and got lost, he always could smell his way back to the car. That dog was awesome, and we loved him like he was a long, lost third brother. 

I was 16 the day that Theodore died. I was playing my favorite video game, Crash Bandicoot, on PlayStation, when I heard a scream coming from the front yard. My mom was out there gardening, and I knew there was nothing in the yard that could make her scream like that. I jumped off the couch and ran outside. Theodore was lying dead in the middle of the street. Apparently a car had whipped around the corner too fast and had hit him right in front of our house. He died right away. 

I was kneeling in the road next to his body before I realized that my mom was doing the same thing. Except she was kneeling next to my little brother, a pool of blood gathering around his head, Theodore’s leash still gripped in his hand. 

The way I felt about Theodore was pretty similar to the way I felt about Ray. Just the way Theodore was the best dog in the world, Ray was the best little brother in the world. He was a hilarious little kid, and was oddly wise for his young age. Even though I was two years older than him, I often found myself going to him for advice. He was one of my best friends. 

That all changed after the accident. Ray had suffered brain damage and entered what the doctors called a “vegetative state”. This turned out to be permanent. 

Years went by. Ray made no improvements. He was a vegetable, in a coma. He responded to nothing. No blinking, no head movement—nothing at all. I couldn’t stand to see my little brother like that. The kid who had once schooled me at Super Smash Bro’s, who I had taught to shoot a basketball, was now breathing only with the help of machines. He would never walk again, or laugh, or do any of the cool shit we had always said we would. 

One day, about 3 years after the accident, the doctors came in the room to discuss something with my mom. This was weird, and signified to us that something important was afoot. My brother had a whole slew of doctors that attended to him, but never had they all been together in the room at the same time. My mother and I were sitting next to my brother’s bed when they walked in, reading the newspaper to him. My mom believed that he could hear what was going on around him, and that he especially enjoyed the paper. When he woke up, she reasoned, he would want to be up on current events. 

“Excuse us,” the most senior looking doctor said. “Could we have a moment?” The doctors asked me to leave the room so they could speak to my mother, and obviously, I refused. If there was something they had to say about Ray, then they could damn well say it in front of me. My mom agreed. “He can stay,” she told them, although they clearly weren’t happy about it, judging from the looks they shot each other. They kept it short and sweet. “Ray’s been with us for three years now, and he hasn’t shown any sign of improvement. He is in a permanent vegetative state, and will be that way for the rest of his life. You may want to consider taking him off life support.”

 My mom took this a lot better than I thought she would. It was because she fully held onto hope that my brother would one day wake up totally fine, as if he were simply waking up from a really long nap. Every morning she started her day thinking, knowing, that that would be the day my brother was sitting up in his bed waiting for her when she walked into his room. 

Every morning, my mom woke up at 6am and got ready for the day, which consisted of sitting at the hospital. Every single day, she sat in that uncomfortable plastic chair next to Ray’s bed. Reading, talking, and praying for her empty shell of a son. Her life had turned into a constant observance of my brother’s horrible state. She was trapped in her refusal to accept the truth—that her baby Ray was gone. I had come to terms with the fact that my brother was basically dead, and I knew he would have accepted and agreed with that fact. I knew he would have hated what his “life” had become, and would not want to exist in such a way. I was able to move on with my life because of this. My mom couldn’t.

Depressing urban music played from the radio of my bright orange Paradise Corporation taxi. I put the taxi into first gear and pulled away into the air. We weaved left and right, dodging the factory chimneys that polluted London's night sky. A giant advertising hoarding danced in the peripheral of my vision. Advertising these days was ever present and always personalised. I turned to look at the advert, it wouldn't disappear until it had been acknowledged. The garish Paradise Corporation's logo and its associated theme song rang out. The advert offered me the chance to fly to one Saturn's  moons. Just twenty thousand dollars. With the advert acknowledged it disappeared, it would not be long before it returned. 

I glanced into the mirror and took a good look at my fare for the first time. It was a six foot tall talking Crocodile, dressed all in black. He was growing restless. It snapped it's jaw and snarled “Turn that shit off!” I quickly shut the radio off, not wanting to chance losing my tip. I studied his face again it was obvious what he was thinking. “A human driving me? And a women to boot.”

I focused my eyes back to the road. London was beautiful from up here, sadly it was a different story back on the ground. We reached out destination.

George relieved himself and only vaguely considered his aim. The bathroom was small equipped with just a sink, mirror and shower cubical. George looked into the mirror and saw a gaunt man of about twenty with dark purple bags below his eyes, he looked very tired. He staggered back towards his computer no more awake than when he first he was first stirred more than an hour ago.

George briefly considered heading to his kitchen to make some food but paused when he thought he had heard his house-mates pottering about. He did not have the energy to face he rarely had the energy to face them. To call them house-mates was ludicrous because he hardly knew them and didn't have any desire to know them. They either were loud, laddy and brash or they were pompous nerdy and obnoxious either way he detested them all.

George glanced towards his supply of weed a pile of about two grams sat in a small metal tin. He would have to try and contact his dealer soon, he didn't have the energy for this either. George put this to the back of his mind and began to gather the necessary equipment needed to roll a spliff. Ultra-thin king sized hemp rolling papers, hemp tips for roach and American Spirit tobacco for smoking mix. George quickly produced a spliff conical in shape with a twisted end. He sat back and admired his work before searching his messy desk for his red clipper. Eventually he found the lighter beneath a pile of chocolate bar wrappers and sparked up the spliff.

Smoking made George feel almost normal again and indeed soon after finishing his smoke he headed for the kitchen ready to face anyone who might be there. He strode quickly and confidently towards the door not even pausing to listen for his house-mates. Once he left the room his confidence seemed to slip and the relief was evident on his face when he found the kitchen to be dark and empty. George stooped down to rummage through his cupboards which were barren except a tin of beans a pot of pickle and half a loaf of bread. George stood up straight his eyes glazed over and he walked quickly towards a dirty grey sofa which sat beneath a large bay window. His hand reached for the red clipper in his pocket, toyed with it for a second or two before sparking it twice. A tall bright orange flame leaped from the lighter and George moved the lighter to the sofa which quickly caught alight. George ran. The building burned.

1329246746.0,3,self.shortstories,pph3v,A Story About a Man with a Woman's Name and a Woman with a Woman's Name; A Gecko and Cactus too (1200 words),sharmalarm,4,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/pph3v/a_story_about_a_man_with_a_womans_name_and_a/,"I just spit this out and it could potentially be longer; lemme me know if you think it's too weird and rambly or if you would read more. It's rough... Thanks so much!

Popping a crisp, clear pop, the egg-yolk sun announced the new day like a Sprite can snapping open in the quietest section of the library.  The egg-yolk too broke open with a sizzle and ran down the length of the high-desert valley, catching the attention of a dozing cactus that probably could have used a few more minutes of sleep.  A dazed lizard rolled over and punched his alarm clock, grabbing his slippers he rose just long enough to bop the ‘pre-heat’ button on the desert thermostat preparing the desert oven for another scorching, hot day.  This lizard had been in charge of turning on heating the desert for years and couldn’t remember a day when they just left it off, slept in, and skipped the 117 degrees; but who was he to argue with tradition?

Humming past Mr. Saguaro and Mr. Gecko exchanging familiar glances, Lauren drank in the languid air of the pre-heating desert and snapped his gloved hand back a little further awakening the emptiness in his stomach and sending his bike careening through the adobe colored valley just a bit too fast for the warmth to keep up.  

This is the story of a man with a woman’s name and a woman with a woman’s name.  They are both average people, with nothing in particular to separate them from the proverbial crowd; at least that is what the movie poster would have you believe, if there was a movie poster for this story.  However no film will be made about these two people and even if it was, they sure wouldn’t go see it!  But I still can’t help but dream of the poster, a huge slab of inked up tree bark, hung in a crowded mall surrounded by thick glass with tiny light bulbs twinkling around the edge. On said poster an uglied-up Johnny Depp would be crouched over a 1980 Honda CX 500 and a deliciously humble-looking Reese Witherspoon seated on the back of this sputtering bike.  With her arms wrapped around him, she hopes he knows where he’s going and wonders if this thing has breaks.  The cactus, Mr. Saguaro, in the desert background that they appear to be speeding though, casts a smokey shadow across the poster and leading toward the title, written in the same muted grey color (TITLE OF SAID FILM)

As he pulled into a Denny’s, the sun catching up to him now, he turned the key and yanked it from the ignition, swung his leg over the bike, and knocked the kickstand down with the grace of a man who had driven through the desert for most of the night.

You see, while this story is begun with an image of a man careening through the desert on an ancient motorcycle searching for his place in the world, having read a few too many pages of ‘Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance’; just an average man with an average name, for a woman, he is not the who this story is about.  He sought a catalyst to break him into greatness and he is a great candidate for a great American coming-of-age novel. This story however is really is more about a girl by the name of Amber.  

An extremely predictable girl by all appearances, she is an even better candidate for a story; primarily because she is not at all suited to be a main character.  She really was quite beige-average, though more attractive than most, and never went above herself to make any lasting effect on anyone.  However humble, Amber did have one particular quality that I began to sense more and more as I created her: though moderately predictable, she walked a cliff in her mind; most of us do.  But she occupied this rift day in and day out, she had even invested in a yellow lawn chair during a clearance sale and set up camp next to this psychological crevice, complete with ice-chest and umbrella, periodically peeking over to see if the bottom was any clearer.  Everyone has one, a cliff that is, a piece of them that if looked at deep enough and long enough will send them inching closer and closer toward the edge, brimming with fascination; most of us don't do this.  Amber did.  

Ever since she was a little girl she had teetered on this edge, a grassy canyon's edge that dropped off onto a bottom far, far below, that she could barely catch sight of.  Today was the day though, and as an unsuspecting Lauren walked into the desert diner, with a tinkle of a bell and a thud of the door, he shocked poor Amber over the edge.  

Leafing through a David Foster Wallace book, she wasn’t reading so much as noticing that, for the first time in her life, the conditions in her mind were translucent enough to make out most of the ledge down below she thought as she leaned further than she could ever remember. Startled by the man’s “hello,” his simple greeting finally sent her toppling over, though she wouldn’t realize this until much later on the back of a motorcycle on its way toward San Francisco.  And after all those years of wondering what was down there, she began to have second thoughts. 
  
But in the spirit of a good story, we won’t ruin that part for her without a good explanation as to how she got there.  It was in fact such an anti-climatic moment that, had the movie opened with this scene, Johnny Depp and Reese Whitherspoon would have been scouring the streets for work, looking rather humble themselves.  But this scene wasn’t a movie yet, it was taking place in real time and real space, and these two things have a way of making even the most mediocre moments pop, and as we know, they too have a way of sending girls toppling over the edges of cliffs.  

“Hi..,” spoke Lauren, wondering whether it was entirely necessary to tear this young waitress from her book, or if maybe he could just slip past her and ask the cook to crack a couple eggs for him as he poured his own coffee.  “Oh! Hello, sorry I was a bit absorbed...we don’t usually get customers this early,” she said with a sleepy smile.  “If you want to come right this way I can seat you in a booth right over here.  Is it okay if I put you next to the kitchen?”  He nodded.  “I suppose I should have asked if it was just you today or if someone else will be joining you,” though they both knew the answer to that question.  She handed him a laminated menu and guessed that he wanted a cup of coffee, smiling.  He looked up and cracked a similar, tired smile sighing, “a whole pot might be a better idea.”  “I’ll see what we can do about that,” she perked up.  Lauren noticed arresting stare and her focused, knowing eyes. “By the way, my name is Amber and I’ll be in charge of you this morning.”

“Amber”, he thought. If it wasn’t enough that she held his gaze like a tired seal holds an ice shelf, even her name screamed a breezy calm, “buy me a taco at El Palomar and hustle me over to the Santa Cruz lighthouse and sit next to me as the Wednesday lunch rush packs itself into a van and guzzles off, leaving us alone with the waves and the gulls waiting for their share of this tortilla.”  ",,False,,t5_2qhmi,True,,,True,t3_pph3v,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/pph3v/a_story_about_a_man_with_a_womans_name_and_a/,

He is one of my favourite people in the world to talk to. He used to be a wild man. He used to drink a lot. He still is a wild man. He no longer drinks. His stories are unforgettable.



**The Fence**

When my Dad was a kid, my Grandpa used to take him hunting for whatever was in season. On this outing they were going out for deer. Back then, they were hunting because they needed the meat to feed themselves. My grandparents didn't have much money and had many mouths to feed. 

So my Dad and my Grandpa drive an hour out of the city to one of the places that they used to frequently hunt. They get there, wander around the woods for 8+ hours trying to scare up some deer and when it is dusk they reluctantly give up. They throw their guns in the backseat, get in the car and start heading home. 

Not far from where they were hunting they drive past a large cattle farm. Without saying a word my Grandpa slows down, and turns the car towards the cow pasture illuminating it with his headlights. He quickly scans the field and spots a small calf with it's mother. Throwing the car in park he reaches into the backseat, grabs a gun and raises it up. He aims at the baby calf and boom; the animal drops and the rest of the herd scatters.

My Grandpa throws the gun in the back. Shuts the car off and runs around to the rear of it and opens the trunk. He runs by my Dad sitting in the passenger seat, and asks him what he is waiting for. My Dad exits the car and runs to the field to catch up to my Grandpa. There is a barbed wire fence that is about 30 feet off the road. 

My Dad holds down the barbed wire and long-legged Grandpa easily steps over it. As my Grandpa gets over the fence, the outside lights of the farmhouse light up 1000ft away. A door slams and a man's voice echoes out from the house. “Hey, what are you doing out there?” My Grandfather ignores this and runs over to the downed calf. He quickly scoops it up and slings it over his shoulder and begins to run back over to the fence where my Dad is waiting.

A shotgun blast rings out from the farmhouse as my Grandpa nears the fence, causing him to throw the calf at my Dad rather than handing it to him. They struggle with getting it over the barbed wire fence as it's fur gets caught in the barbs. 

Another shotgun blast rings out a little closer this time and now my Grandpa decides that he needs to get over that fence more than he needs the calf. He instructs my Dad to just drop the calf and help him back over the fence. 

My Grandpa gets back over the fence and both him and my Dad scramble back to the car slam the trunk, and take off. Once inside the vehicle, my Dad can see that my Grandpa is pretty cut up. 

At this point my Grandpa informs my Dad that they won't be going home, but that they will go park somewhere for an hour or two and return for their kill when the farmer goes back to sleep. Time passes and they head back to the farm to check out the situation. 

As they approach, they can see flashing lights in front of the farm. They drive by without stopping as there are three or four Police cruisers and even more officers. My Grandpa sighs, looks over at my Dad and tells him not to tell his mother what happened.

When they got home it was well past midnight. My Grandpa's clothes were soaked in blood and he was still bleeding from his run in with the fence. So as not to alert my Grandma, he woke up my two aunts (who were maybe 5-10 at the time) and had them tend to his many wounds with peroxide and cotton swabs. He told the girls the same thing he told my Dad and when they were finished they just went back to sleep.

I still don't know if my Grandma ever found out or not.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_p7oe2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/p7oe2/stories_from_my_grandpa/,

I killed a man on a psycho’s lawn, and the next day, the psycho came into my office and asked if I would like to eat lunch with him. He seemed to be acting perfectly normal. I noticed his speech pattern had changed as well. He wasn’t saying “ya” or swearing anymore. Something was off. Or maybe Noah had just realized how messed what we had done was. 
I put it out of my mind, and started to enjoy myself. Noah was actually very intelligent and funny. He must have been intelligent from the start, I concluded, he is a lawyer after all. He was probably just drunk for the last week. I chuckled at the thought.
We finished up our lunch, and headed out to my car. Noah said he had left his phone at my office, so I offered to take him there before I took him home. He thanked me in an uncharacteristically gratuitous way. However, I didn’t sense anything was amiss, and we got in. 
Big mistake. The minute I got in the car, Noah pulled out what looked like an ingot, and bashed me across the head with it. 
I woke up in a small, cramped room that I recognized as the interior of Noah’s shed. 
“Took you long enough,” said Noah in a cold voice. “What the fuck?” I demanded.
“I can’t have another murderer taking advantage of Noah, now can I,” he said in that cold voice, “No, I’m going to have to kill you I suppose.”
“What? No! Noah, you don’t have to do this. I’m not going to tell anybody, you can let me go.” I knew he wasn’t going to.
“Noah’s not here right now. If you’d like to leave a message, please don’t. I screen his calls.”
Noah had finally snapped. The bastard was crazy.
I tried to reason with him, “C’mon Noah. You know you don’t have to do this!”
“I TOLD YOU I’M NOT NOAH!”
“If you’re not Noah, who are you then?”
“BELLUA.”
No. It couldn’t be. Noah had talked about Bellua so much, but always acted as Bellua was a friend or something. I finally put the pieces together. 
“Yes, I can see the truth has finally dawned on you,” Noah/Bellua drawled, “Frankly, I don’t see how an idiot like you became a neurosurgeon. Let me explain it to you. I’m the original Noah. The Noah you know is simply a second personality of mine. Noah was born after I was caught in an explosion. That’s why he is so fixated on fire. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember, but now that I have the Other Noah, it is so much easier for me to cleanse this disgusting society. The Other Noah agrees. He doesn’t have my capacity, so he uses fire as his tool. It’s crude but it works. Why, just recently he managed to rid society of a bartender who was a serial rapist. I’m much more dedicated however. I take out the real sickos. Like you. And Other Noah will dispose of your body. You pretend to kill only bad people, but what about the little girl who you kidnapped and did unspeakable things to? What about the man you decapitated for fun? ANSWER ME? Why’d did you do it? Did you have any reason? NO! I may be a monster, but I know that! People like you, who pretend to be infallible, make me sick!”
My cheeks were so cold. I couldn’t believe it. How did he know all this? 
I knew I was going to die. I began to say an Our Father.
“YES. This reaction. I love it!” Noah/Bellua bellowed, “The ‘prayer,’ as if pretending to repent to an entity you’ve never believed in will make it all better. Using religion as a fair-weather friendship with God, I love it! But why bother praying to God now? I control your life now: I am your God. Pray to me!”
I said nothing. Noah/Bellua began to pace, muttering something under his breath. 
“What?” I said.
“Squares!” He murmured a little louder,
I realized what he was doing: getting ready to kill me. Finally, I closed my eyes, went limp,  and gave up.
But he wouldn’t let me do that. He yanked up into a sitting position forcefully, and suddenly I felt metal being pressed down, then a sharp pain in the back of my neck. He wouldn’t stop. It felt like he was cutting something out. When he finished, he showed me what he had done. The square piece of my skin he had cut out was dripping with my blood. 
“And now, I must bid you adieu,” Noah/Bellua whispered into my ear. And all was dark.

As I gently lifted the flap of skin back, I admired the fragility and solidity of the skull. How could something so dull possibly reveal the beautiful secrets of the organ it housed? I stood aside as the secondary surgeon drilled through the skull. “Which hemisphere did you say I was supposed to remove?” I joked. One of the interns laughed too hard. Ass kisser. 
            “The hemispherectomy went well enough,” I told the parents. “If all goes well, little Tyler should be able to walk and talk a little in about a week.” The look of joy on the parents’ faces should have warmed my heart. Any other surgeon would have succumbed and allowed themselves a grin. I know how I’m supposed to act, and so I feigned a smile, then turned and returned to my office.
            I reviewed the logs and tape from the surgery, before packing it up and handing it to an intern to give to the dean. 
            As I drove home, I wondered if Noah had received the body. I thought back to when I first met Noah. The psycho had been at a bar, where I had only gone to have one drink before going home. He had started ranting about how he was going to burn the entire world down one day. The bartender then made the biggest mistake a bartender can make, and cut the poor bastard off. Noah then had started to bawl his eyes out, and started apologizing to thin air. Something about “why’d I help ‘em?”
            The bartender said he was going to call a taxi, but Noah had mumbled something about not having any cash. Before the bartender said anything else, I volunteered to take him home. That sentence seemed to aggravate Noah even more. “Fuck homes!” he had yelled. I asked him whether he had a place to stay. “Yeah, but that shithole’ll never be a fucking home” he growled. “Does this shithole have an address?” I remember saying.
            Over the course of the following week, Noah and I became closer. “So Doc,” he would say, “I got this fucking twinge in my neck, ya think ya could check it out?” I would gently remind his that I was a neurosurgeon.
            I discovered Noah’s “little secret” two weeks after the night in the bar. Noah had come to the hospital with a broken arm, and it was my day for clinic rounds. I remember sitting awkwardly in the room with Noah for a minute before Noah chuckled and said, “That file probably has it all in there right?” Seeing the confused look on my face, he said, “Why don’t I just tell ya, I’d rather ya hear it from me.”
            He then proceeded to tell me everything. About how he posed as a lawyer to seem normal, but how he was actually a murderer and an arsonist And about how he spent all his money on booze and accelerant. “Well actually, Bellua’s the murderer, I just burn shit,” he clarified. I had no idea who this “Bellua” was, but I didn’t care anymore. This was just too messed up. 
            Yes, technically I’m a murderer, but not to this psycho’s extent. I’ve only ever killed for other people’s benefit. There was the time I prescribed a double dosage of Luvox to a patient who I knew had been skimming money from the school district, and that other time when I had tampered with the drill before surgery to kill a corrupt judge on the table; but these had all been for the good of society. 
            I didn’t tell Noah any of this, I simply pretended he was joking, although I knew he wasn’t, and proceeded to call a nurse in to set his arm.
            Later, I called Noah and told him how I was a murderer too. I realized Noah had provided a golden opportunity to kill and not risk being caught at work. I proposed that I kill, and Noah dispose of the body’s. Noah agreed, and said that whenever I kill something, I should bring it to his house, and leave it somewhere no one else would see it, he would find it.
            This had been my first kill I was going to share with Noah. I had sliced a corrupt policeman across the throat, and let him bleed out on Noah lawn. Then, I covered the body with a hot tub cover, and left.

Cancer Killer.,hightreason,5,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ntirb/ken_hagen_cancer_killer/,"Ken Hagen dreamt of tumors and dull cutlery. In his nightmares a woman lays on an operating table surrounded by surgeons and nurses, a mass of sick tissue slowly choking her to death. The doctor, with the cool collected tones of an airline pilot announcing the altitude says “scalpel”. A nervous resident, probably only a couple weeks out of med school quickly hands him the instrument. The key. The key that opens the door to her salvation. The surgeon skillfully lines up the scalpel to make the incision, his hands steady, a nurse wipes his brow. As he places the blade to her skin, he realizes something is wrong, it won’t cut the flesh. He presses harder. Nothing. He grabs another scalpel, to no avail, it just won’t cut. From seemingly nowhere he grabs a large butcher knife and plunges it down with deadly force, only to have it bounce from her rubbery flesh without leaving a mark. “I need something sharp!”, he screams. But he is alone. “Dammit isn’t anything around here fucking SHARP?”. The woman’s breathing becomes ragged as the surgeon dashes from the room in a panic, the sound of shattering glass is heard and the man returns, but he is no longer a surgeon, he is Ron Popeil. Ron Popeil with an axe. He raises the axe above his head like a demented lumberjack, like Paul Bunyan about to fell a mighty pine with one swing. The woman flatlines. “This oughtta do it”, Popeil says. He swings the axe down with all his might. 

SLAM! 

Ken Hagen awoke in a cold clammy sweat, he was having the dream again. “Fucking Ron Popeil” he muttered to himself. The night was cold and Ken had only slept in fits, the tattered sleeping bag his only source of warmth. The squeals and click-clacking of the train told him it was time to move. Ken was a drifter, he traveled from place to place by boxcar, riding the rails like a ghost. He floated through towns an apparition, once he was gone no one was really sure if he had existed at all. He went by many names: Kenneth Hague, Kent Higgins, Kimbo Von Hindquarters to name a few. His breast pocket bulged with writing utensils. He had a pen for every occasion, blue ink, black ink, red ink, ball point, felt, permanent, semi-permanent and even an antique quill pen just in case. He carried a number two pencil, and kept it deadly sharp. He wore a feather in his cap, and he carried a small kit. This kit allowed Ken to do the two things he did best, the two things he was born to do. 

Sharpen knives and cure cancer. 

Curing cancer was of course his primary concern but he needed something to get his foot into people’s doors, and knife sharpening was his ticket. In fact, over the years Ken had gotten pretty damn good at sharpening things, he even considered settling down a few times when he came upon a sleepy town filled with fetching women and dull edges. But something always pressed him on. His destiny, he had come to realize was to kill cancer. 

Cancer had nearly killed Ken once upon a time, he was so sick and in so much pain that he attempted to take his own life by drinking a mixture of jet fuel, shark cartilage, lentil soup, tabasco sauce, Pert Plus shampoo, and Steel Reserve. He awoke on the floor of his garage eighteen hours later and realized two things: His cancer was gone, and he had pooped his pants. 

A clean pair of shorts later Ken realized that he had stumbled upon an elixir with amazing curative properties. A true nectar of the gods. Over the next few weeks Ken perfected the mixture and soon he was ready to begin his quest. “No one’s gonna believe me”, he said to no one in particular. He pulled a cucumber out of the refrigerator to slice up for a salad. His knife wouldn’t cut it, it was too dull. The faint sound of a train whistle could be heard miles away. 

So much time had passed since then, it seemed like another life, like his life before the elixir was only a fever dream and his life since all too real. Ken darted from the train as it grunted to a stop, dashing into the bushes before anyone saw. He walked through a wooded area and wondered aloud “Do squirrels get cancer?”, they probably did he answered himself, they were just too primitive to understand it. Lucky them. 

Lucky, Indiana was little more than a crossroads and a post office. The kind of town you could miss if you blinked, but Ken Hagen never blinked. Not very often anyway. He came here because of his list, the list of every person in America that had cancer. How he got the list is so secret that not even the person who invented Ken Hagen knows how he got it. He just got it. Now he was checking his list like Santa, if only Ken could travel the world in a single night like Old St. Nick he could cure cancer in a day. “Fat Bastard”, Ken muttered to himself, the next person on his list was not far from here. Betsy LaRue was her name. 

Ken tapped a familiar rhythm “Shave and a haircut, two bits”, he mumbled to himself. He wondered about the origins of that phrase, and if two bits was a quarter then what was one bit? Twelve and a half cents? It didn’t matter, Ken didn’t even have that much. And what about. . . 

The door opened revealing Ms. LaRue, a gaunt skeletal shell of a woman, a bandana covering her bald chemotherapy ravaged scalp. Death would soon be knocking at her door, luckily Ken Hagen got there first. “Hello Ms. LaRue, my name is Charlie Lininger”, Ken said, pulling the fake name out of his ass. “Might I interest you in my utensil and cutlery sharpening services?” a smile crossed her lips and Ken realized that she had once been beautiful, and still was in a way. “Sure”, she said, “I’m going to die in three months anyways and I might as well have sharp utensils the rest of the way.” 

That’s what they all say. 

She showed Ken to the kitchen, it was filled with slicers, dicers, choppers, and knife sets all sold by Ron Popeil. Ken hated Ron Popeil. His products were all bullshit, Popeil claims his blades stay sharp for life which is only true if you’re talking about the life of a fruit fly. Ken often daydreamed while riding the rails about slicing Ron Popeil’s throat with one of his own knives while whispering into his ear as he gurgled his last breath “Set it and forget it, dick”. But sharpening these substandard knives was not what he was here to do. 

“Ms. LaRue, I know you’re sick”, Ken said “And I can help you”. Betsy took a step back, “I thought you were here to sharpen my knives”, she said. “I am, but I can also take away your cancer, I can fix you, if you’ll let me”. She slowly reached for the 32 piece RonCo knife set on the counter and said. “You’re crazy, get out of my house!”. Ken could only smile as he said “Ma’am, we both know that those knives are so dull they couldn’t cut Jell-O, now just hear me out, please”. 

“How can you possibly help me? I’ve got terminal cancer of the liver”, she said with tears forming at the corners of her eyes. “I have an elixir that will rid your body of cancer, I know it sounds crazy but what do you have to lose? If it doesn’t work, then you’ll still die but if it works. ..”. “I could live”, she said. Her hand withdrew from the knife set. 

Ken slowly poured the elixir into a mug with a picture of Snoopy on it, he was laying on top of his doghouse and that stupid little yellow bird was saying something to him but Ken didn’t bother to read it. “Now Ms. LaRue, drink the mixture down quickly.” She sniffed the liquid, her upper lip curling at the acrid smell, “Are you sure this will work Mr. Lininger?” she asked. Ken placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, “It worked on me”, he said. Without another thought she downed the entire mug and promptly slumped over in her chair. Ken gingerly lifted her up and carried her to the couch where she could rest comfortably. 

He pulled out his list, selected the proper pen from his wide assortment and crossed her name off. He then sharpened every one of her piece of shit Ron Popeil knives, helped himself to a sandwich and a beer from the fridge, took a hot shower and left unceremoniously. He had a train to catch, and a hell of a lot more names on his list. 

Betsy LaRue woke up eighteen hours later and she realized two things: Her cancer was gone, and she had pooped her pants. She vaguely remembered a man knocking at her door. 

But she couldn’t remember his name.

He glanced in his mirror almost not recognizing what he saw before him, his once neat black hair had become greasy and unkempt and his skin was growing more and more pale, his arms growing skinnier. The more hours Tom had to put in at his work as an I.T. Consultant the worse and worse he looked. “Today’s the day.” he said, forcing a smile on his face “Today’s the day.”

  The day seemed to drag on, seconds felt like hours, minutes like days. Tom had been planning on quitting his job for months now, working up the courage to do so. He was not very confident and rarely acted out on his desires. He was constantly being harassed by his boss George Howard who was a very controlling man and often went the extra mile to make Tom miserable. Tom was on break when he passed George’s office, he knocked on the door. “What!?” George screamed, as if Tom was about to pull his teeth. Tom froze, speechless, he knew what he wanted to say but the words were not coming out.
“Quit standing there like a fucking moron and get back to work.” Tom’s face was becoming red as he remembered all the times George had harassed him at work.
”Screw you fat ass.” Tom said immediately regretting what he said. George’s eyes bulged out of his head. “What the hell did you just say to me” George was now stomping closer and closer to Tom. “Fuck, yo-.“ Before Tom could get his word out George’s fist met his face with stunning force. Tom’s body went limp as his head hit the floor with a loud thump.

“It’s about time you woke up, you were starting to worry us.” Tom heard as he was opening his eyes. “Where am I?” “St. Josephs Hospital.” She replied. The woman was tall and had long brown hair. “You’re way to hot to be a nurse.” Tom was surprised by his own bluntness. “Thank you Tom” she said, she didn’t seem effected by his comment at all. “What is that?” Tom said referring the green liquid she was putting in his I.V. “Just something to sooth the nerves.” As soon as she injected the liquid Tom felt a Freezing tingling sensation all over his body and was unable to move. “Damn it!” he thought, “What the hell is going on!” His vision began to tunnel as his nurse drew closer. She slipped something around his neck and give him a kiss on the mouth. “Good luck Tom, you’ll need it” He immediately passed out.

“Am I stuck in some sort of dream? I can’t be.” He thought as he finally came to. He quickly reached around his neck to reveal what the mystery woman left him. “What the hell?” It was a bight silver key with a ball on the end, Tom examined it further T.K. “Those are my initials, this has got to be a coincidence” Tom didn’t have much time to look at the key before a strange man in a black over coat barged into the hospital. “Where the hell is she!?” he screamed “Where is the key?” Tom’s eyes light up “There is no way he’s talking about this.” He thought. “Where is the woman!?” he kept yelling. Tom overheard a nervous clerk stating they don’t know what he’s talking about. Just then the man pulls out a gun. “Screw this!” Tom said, jumping up head still pounding from the punch. He spotted a door down the hall with an exit sign. As he was stealthily making his way to the door he spotted his clothes on the chair next to him quickly grabbing them as quietly as possible. “What the hell is up with today?” he thought getting closer and closer to the door. The man with the gun was growing more angry, he let out a warning shot sending everyone into panic. Tom had finally reached the door, grabbed the handle and pulled with all his might, the door wouldn’t budge, it was locked. “Can this day get any worse.” he thought. Just then the glimmer from the key caught his eye. “Well it’s worth a try.” He thought as he took it off his neck and cupped it in his hand.

“Tom Keen!!” Tom turned around and froze like a deer in the headlights, the man with the gun was now pointing it at him and walking his way. “Give me the God Damn key Tom before people get hurt!” Tom glanced at the key and smiled moving it closer and closer to the door, all Tom could think about was how he wanted to be home in his own bed. “Tom I will shoot you if you don’t hand it over!” Tom thought for a second looked towards the door and back at the man with the gun “Fuck yo-“ Just then the door opened with a bright light that absorbed Tom.

Tom woke up in a sweat, looking around he was in his room, blaring music coming from the living room he glanced at the clock as it read “5:00”. Tom was beginning to freak out he immediately look down at his hand to reveal that key still grasp firmly in his fist. “What the hell is happening?” He looked at the key again, He began smiling drawing it close to his bedroom door. “I want to go to Paris.” he said half jokingly. As soon as the key touched the door it flew open with the same bright light and in the blink of an eye Tom was standing only a few feet away from the Eiffel Tower. Tom then grew the biggest smile. “Today’s the day.”

**The Monster from Midtown**

I’m going to eat you, said the monster.

Hmm, what, Cheryl replied. Darling it’s late, can’t we save it until morning.

The monster was confused. Rawwwwwwrrrr he screamed.

Ughhh, I know, tell me about. I don’t know why I keep doing this to myself. Every weekend. But say, thank you so much for taking me home from Alistair’s, God that man can sure throw a party.

The monster had done no such thing. In fact he had abducted her stumbling up from midtown at four in the morning. He raised his claws and bared his fangs. He was hungry. He hadn’t enjoyed a proper human in weeks.

Oblivious, Cheryl rummaged through her purse. Say, do you have a Xanax on you? I just can’t bare to be awake any longer.  Oh good, here’s one. She crushed the pill up into a little line on the coffee table and snorted it with a twenty. Don’t look, I know it’s disgusting. God I’m sorry we had to meet like this, and I thought things were going so nicely at the bar. Well, this is me. We can talk about it in the morning ok? Promise.

She fell backwards onto the couch, catatonic. Within a minute, she was snoring.

This was horrible. The monster craved the taste of wriggling human. He prodded her with the tip of his claw. No response. He pounced up and down on the floor of the apartment. He hollered and beat his chest. Nothing. At last, he checked for a heartbeat. Satisfied she was still alive, he went to bed for the night dreaming of a hearty breakfast.

He awoke to the sound of a blender. He groaned.

Hi sleepy head, Cheryl said from the kitchen. Would it kill you to keep some fresh fruit around? I had to truck it two blocks to find the nearest grocer. Also, you didn’t tell me you lived on East 87th? And in the basement of an abandoned church? Helloo, that is so cool. These floors, my god, I would kill for these floors.

The monster rushed into the kitchen. I’m going to eat you, he roared.

Oh, Cheryl said, slightly taken aback. Come on, I wasn’t actually going to kill you for this place, although seriously, how’d you land such a nice pad? You must have killed somebody. It’s an absolute crime to have a place like this.

She peered at him from over the blender. Huh, she said, I remembered you being cuter. Must have been the lighting. Well look, have a smoothie with me. It’s got B vitamins and dried kelp for the hangover. And then I really must be going. Brunch with the girls today. I have to get down all the way to 11th and 5th Ave. God, can you imagine how long that will take?

He took the offered smoothie. It tasted like rotten seaweed. Rawwrrrr, he screamed, heaving the contents across the room.

You’re mad at me. Ok, lets talk it out. I’m sorry about last night. Last night was..., well maybe you and I can just pretend last night never happened. Our little secret? Honestly, this is going to be embarrassing, but I can’t even remember your name. I’m Cheryl, and you are?

The monster was stunned. No one had asked him for his name in over a hundred years. 

Frank, he replied.

Well pleased to meetcha Frank, she said. You know, you are kinda growing on me. You’re quiet, I like that. Call me up this week? Do you like mussels? I know a great place on 13th st. 

She placed her card on the counter. Ciao, she said.

Before Frank could finish deliberating whether to eat her or not, the door had clicked shut. He sighed. He was so hoping to spend a lazy Saturday, full and happy.

He lifted her card. Cheryl Baker. He didn’t recognize the name of her company. A number and note were scribbled on the back. This is my cell. Don’t be shy, it read.

Frank let out a dejected bellow. After some time, he called for Chinese. The delivery guy would do in a pinch.

====

He called her up. He wasn’t exactly sure why. Well number one, he was hungry again, but number two, there was something about her. She didn’t seem to mind that he was almost seven feet tall, covered in hair with sharp claws and fangs. It was a hard life being a monster with the torches and the slaying and the what not. Aside from other monsters (and he hated spending time with other monsters), no one had been nice to him in a very long time. 

I do miss being around someone nice. And, he thought, if things don’t turn out, I can always eat her.

They went to the mussels place on 13th st. He gagged on the wine and spit it out all over the table. 

Hmm, she said, you’re right this wine is absolutely awful. Languedocs can be so hit or miss.

She hated the way he dressed, all rags and burlap. Honey, she told him, I know it’s hard, but we’re not film majors at NYU anymore. You might be trying to make a statement, but it’s paralyzing being around you. Can you imagine the stares if I brought you to lunch with dad at the Union Club?

He relented. 

She took him to a tailor by the Park and had him measured for a set of nice suits. 

Honestly she said one day at brunch with the girls, it feels like I’m dating a monster sometimes. I mean the things he wears? And how he eats? I swear I’ve never seen him chew.

Darling, said Elise, he’s just like Bradley. You will not believe what he did. I found him in the kitchen shoving a hot dog down his throat, dribbling mustard all down the front of his shirt. I told him right then and there to cancel our reservation. No need showing up if you’re going to look like you came straight from a baseball game in the Bronx!

Cheryl had already moved on in thought. I’m going to see if I can get his hair done, she said aloud. It’s hideously long.

Did you not have the heart to tell him Grunge died in the 90s? Rachel mocked.

The stylist in SoHo lopped off his mane and insisted he put some smelly oils in the remaining locks. The suit jackets made him feel constricted and itchy. The wines at dinner tasted like spoiled fruit. He absolutely despised frisse salads.

Still, he went on with Cheryl. For some reason, he liked her. He liked how she talked incessantly. He liked the shiny bits of metal she wore. He liked going out in public without causing an uproar. 

When he went out alone, he was a monster. Around Cheryl, he felt, almost human. 

He began to appreciate the finer things in life. He enrolled in a wine class to refine his palette and slowly graduated from buttery Chardonnays and fruit bomb Cabernets to more nuanced Brunellos and Petite Syrahs. He took up squash with Cheryl’s brother and dominated at the club. He read up on the newest exhibits at the Guggenheim and sharp underground plays opening off Broadway on the Upper West. For the first time in decades, he was enjoying himself.

Frank, Cheryl interrupted. They were at a late dinner at Bella’s on West 84th. The restaurant was closing. Only a few other diners remained. 

We need to talk. I’m all for openness and I think you and I have done a good job of being open with one another so I think it’s healthy if I just clear the air. I’m seeing someone else.

Who, Frank growled.

A nice guy I met down at a gallery in TriBeCa. You remember, it was that night you blew me off because you said you absolutely had to have some fresh human flesh. You know I’m a vegetarian, well pescetarian really. Anyway, could you blame me? I was disconsolate, I went alone and had a bunch of Sidecars and there he found me by the bar.

But why? Frank said.

Why? Why? Because it’s suffocating being around you lately Frank. You’ve changed. You used to be interesting, and now I swear, I can’t tell you apart from Dad’s golf buddies. Don’t you blame me now, it’s not like I haven’t tried. I do so much for us, when was the last time you put anything into this relationships?

But my hair, my clothes, I did all of this for you.

Oh please, I hate it when men are such pushovers. It’s the 21st century, honey you were doing yourself a favor not me. Besides, I liked the way you dressed before, it was so hip. You had style.

It was too much for Frank. Something snapped. He snatched Cheryl and crammed her down his throat whole. The waiter screamed, and he ate him too. He devoured the other patrons before lazily munching on the kitchen staff.

After picking the restaurant clean, he retired to a table, completely gorged. A long belch escaped from his stomach. The sommelier had been particularly heavy going down. Still, what a fine meal.

He poked around the cellar and pulled out a dust covered bottle of Napoleon brandy, just the thing to help him digest.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_mbbzf,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/mbbzf/five_stories_project_snobbery/,

She slowly starts to peak around the edge of the wall when a loud “SHHRRIEK” echoed terribly off the moldy ceramic walls. Quickly she jerks her head back in fear of being spotted.  Cautiously dropping to her knees and now down on all fours she tries to look again.  The long hall is slightly misty because of the broken windows and the adjacent forest next to the abandon hospital. About halfway down the passageway, broken beams of moonlight fall upon the blood soaked floors from the previous victims who were brought here that tried to escape. At the far end it appears very deep and dark… Her hopes are set on the stairwell that is mirrored to the one she just came from; hoping desperately that it is unobstructed.  At least 5 minutes pass without as much as a sound from anywhere.  The silence is very thick and weighs heavily upon her eardrums.  She decides that now is the time... Slowly she starts to stand back up as her knees and ankles crack like twigs.  Waiting again for a few more minutes to make sure she didn’t stir up attention, she begins her trip down the hall, staying close to the walls and underneath the windows of the closed doors in the ward.  Peeking around the corners of the open doors where the moonlight shines in to make sure the coast is clear and continues to press on, she is more than halfway down the hall now and is coming into the darkest part when she hears movement from behind her…she quickly turns her head to see the Zombie flying out of one of the rooms and in full stride, hungry for the scent of fresh blood dripping from her wounds.  She runs as hard and as fast as she can into the pure darkness, hands in front of her reaching out to slam in the handle of the stairwell door when she reaches it.  Wham the door flings open in a whoosh and jerks her in with it, losing her balance but only for a moment. She turns and slams the door back closed, just in time to hear the dreadful Zombie behind her slam head first into the heavy steel door.  “Sigh""  she breathes a full chest of air in relief. “I made it, I made it”…… “SHHRRIEK” she spins around just in time to see the putrid mouth of another Zombie lurching at her thin frail neck as into tears her flesh and veins, her head is severed off and lays into a pool of her own blood as her eyes still process the horrific scene to her brain, watching as the zombie feasts on her fresh corpse.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_ibl2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ibl2c/abandoned/,

It was the year 250,000,000 BC. It was the year 2011 AD. It was the end of the universe. It was every year, all at once.

A man tunnels inside a mountain using his pickaxe as a woman bites in to a freshly baked bagel. The mountain fractures apart in to pieces that are sent to the coal power plant. The bagels finish baking and the warm smell fills the kitchen in the bakery. The miner coughs and feels slightly ill. The electricity from the coal plant is sold at a rate of 10.96¢/kW•h. The woman pays for the bagel. The baker paid the electricity bill and the woman’s hunger feels temporarily satisfied.

It’s there. The path the energy took. The miner, the coal, the electricity, the bagel, the woman's satisfaction…you see it all. It’s at once obvious and yet mysteriously laden with hidden details.

You see beings, human and other, making decisions in their lives based on the way they experience reality. “How imperfect their information. It feels almost shameful, being trapped such a low-dimensional manner like that. Like a prisoner. Or an insect. Or perhaps Pac-Man, controlled by the joystick. How limited.” you think to yourself, as if there were anyone else to think it to.

It’s all twisting and folding, wiggling around and too impressive to take in at any one moment. Its pores breathe with life at the biggest and smallest of scales, each scale cooperating with all the others in surprising ways to produce layers upon layers of interwoven complexity. “Oh… if only the beings trapped in this thing could come outside it for a second and see it from this perspective” you think, soaking in the richness of detail available in this oversized fractal. The biggest and smallest sizes have a difference of several hundred orders of magnitude, yet it seemed most humans only used a few of them. Silly humans.

You fly around and zoom and expand certain portions of time and space, examining some parts of the 4-dimensional block with more scrutiny. You pass through it and around it like a ghost while occasionally grabbing on to edges to pivot around, floating like an astronaut outside the space ship. Except you were outside the universe.

The universe exploded in to existence at the start, you see. And the end showed the last souls blowing out their final breaths, silently giving homage to every being that had ever died before them. Somewhere else, it was a balmy 86 degree day in southern Florida as a few gentlemen went fishing in a boat one of them was still making loan payments on.

“A lot of them seem to take the game quite seriously, this game of being.” You look around some more, pinching and grabbing the multi-textured styrofoam-like contours of this crazy 4D thing, romantically grasping as if your hand holds were jacket lapels on the coat of a lover. There’s so much emotion and hurt and suffering and pain, while also harboring unbelievable joy, compassion, beauty, and peace. All more or less self-contained in this one object, what a marvel! 

You fly to a different place. The United States president gave a long awaited speech to millions of diversely-opinioned citizens while inside their bodies billions of glucose molecules metabolized as they processed the words rolled to them down the social hierarchy from above. The atoms the people were made of seemed to buzz with imprecise possibility, as did their states of minds. The decision was made, and the action was performed by the government. The people had mixed opinions about the results.

Then, out of nowhere, there’s a pulling. Away from this thing in a manner that didn’t seem controllable or comprehendible in that moment, like the rug was jerked out from under your feet or the chair accidentally leaned too far back. You were in freefall, away from what was familiar. It had been happening the whole time, but you had only just realized it was going on. You reach out to this thing in desperation, this giant marvelous complicated life-giving thing, and yet the metaphorical lapels slip from your fingers. It’s so pretty you want to look at it forever.

The pulling persists. It seems as though you have angered a strange form of gravity. There’s a sense of confusion and slight panic.

You cling on to this 4D network of form and ideas and lifestyles and meaning and values. You try so hard to keep it from leaving you. In the last moments you see a human, a specific one. This human was you. Or… you thought it was you. But now you're up here. 

You are dying. Or you died. You remember now. It’s hard to tell which, causality didn’t seem to have the same meaning here. It seemed to just happen moments ago. There was a strange feeling. “Oh well” you laugh to your ever-changing self. What a farce. What a beautiful farce. 

The universe leaves your hands and you plummet away from it.

At that moment of letting go, you briefly forget you were ever alive to begin with. You began to exist in a new way you’d forgotten was possible. You became it, it became you, and all was forgiven. All love and compassion, no divisions or walls. Not just this marvelously complex life-giving 4D thing either, but all the other things too. *All of them*. “Welcome back!” reality said to itself, to you.

You realized you had won the war, whatever that was about. What’s the point in fighting if there is no disagreement? You dissolve in to it like a drop of ink dissolves in to the entire ocean.  

The coal miner exhaled the last puffs of poisonous carbon monoxide as he passed out from asphyxiation inside the mountain. “That bagel was delicious.” said the woman at another time and place. And she was right, it was delicious.

1285565950.0,3,self.shortstories,djcmg,The future,Sarah_Connor,5,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/djcmg/the_future/,"In the year [2010](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8024991/Patients-to-be-frozen-into-state-of-suspended-animation-for-surgery.html), scientists perfected suspended animation through the use of cryogenics for the purpose of surgery. After more than a decade of study and refinement, long term suspended animation became a reality, yet a privilege reserved for only the most wealthy and influential.

The thinking at the time was that only those who showed a global and fundamental contribution to society (while still viewed through the ridiculously tinted lenses of the global elite of the era) were worthy of entering into such state.

The process was both incredibly complex and costly. As each Transport, as they were known, required their own stand alone facility to be built around them. Significant resources were put into the development of each facility as they required complete autonomous support systems to accommodate whatever duration was selected by the Transport.

Standalone, yet fully redundant, power, security and life support systems were essential to the longevity of each facility.

Additionally, it was recognized that monetary resources would be subject to change over time, especially fiat-currency based resources. Thus there was a need to place physical holders of value that would be perceived to not deplete/dilute over time into the facilities for use by the Transport when they resuscitate.

These resources are the most sought after treasure of the new world.

After hundreds of years of human progress, civilization could no longer sustain itself in an organized self-supporting system. Through utter corruption of what some call the human soul, the world has fallen dark. There are very few outposts of safety in the current Trial of Life, as its now known.

Many Transporters have been found, resuscitated and exploited already. There are believed to be many many more, but their locations are both secret and secure. Akin to your life relying on the discovery of an undisturbed Tomb of a Pharaoh - even though every consciousness on the planet is also seeking the same tomb.

They are the last bastion of hope for they alone have the reserves of precious materials needed to sustain life for the current generation.

[Metals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium#Production), technology (however outdated), medicines, seeds, weapons and minerals are all a part of each Transport 'Crop'.

One find can support a group or community for years alone based on the barter and renewable resource potentials in each Crop.

One transport, found in 2465, that of a long dead nanotech pioneer - who was purportedly responsible for much of the cybernetic medical capabilities of the 21st century, which he sought to cure his [genetic predisposition](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/06/ff_sergeys_search/) for a certain disease, was so vast that the still powerful city-state in the western province of North America was able to be founded.

The resources of this individual were extraordinary, but his resuscitation, as they all are, was rather gruesome and cold.

The security systems in each Transport Facility are biometric and very complex. They can only be accessed by a living, calm and (relatively) healthy Transport.

If the system, and its control mechanism AI, detect signs of duress, stress or serious injury to the Transport - they go into fail-safe. Which is to say they self [detonate](http://www.ripten.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/nuke-needs-to-be-bigger.jpg). Taking with them all resources, the Transport and the Seekers as well.

There have been many instances of this, such that the art of successful Resuscitation has become an extremely profitable business.

The most active and successful Resuscitation Team (RT) have been the ironically named, Live Well Group.

The most conniving, well practiced and profitable con in the history of mankind.

LWG alone has been responsible for the resuscitation of more than 370Transports. Their group is currently the most powerful in the world. With their own city-state, established after the Brin case mentioned, they have a cast of thousands of cons all working to ensure the Transport believes they have been Awakened to a new, advanced, safe world and that they would be allowed to stake part in a significant way now that they have been Transported.

They are fooled into releasing their resources, then brutally tortured for information about any other Transports or any other knowledge they may possess, which invariably is less than nothing.

It is a hard world out there now, and the LWGs ruthless strive to locate the thousands of other Transport Facilities is both the worst aspect of our modern struggle - yet ironically will serve to be the basis of the ongoing endeavor of the species.

There is rumor of a vast facility of resources and Transports in an underground 'CITY' of the most elite Transports ever. A facility supposedly comprised of the [13](http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/bloodlines/introduction.htm) most powerful and rich bloodlines of people to have ever existed.

It is not known which continent this facility is on, but I believe it is in Antarctica - fully automated and with the ability to auto-resuscitate at a given time.

This is my mission, this is my life's work. To find and own this facility and crush any and all other groups that oppose me.

1268323649.0,3,self.shortstories,bc488,I'll Be Watching Your Dogs Take a Shit,flampoo,4,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/bc488/ill_be_watching_your_dogs_take_a_shit/,"Jarrod,

While I cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you're personally responsible for the large pile of dog shit found on the driver's seat of my dad's station wagon, my intuition senses your guilt.

1) **Your family has three dogs**: two Sharpei's and a Pit Bull. This means you're the only person in the neighborhood with access to that much dog crap. Sure, Mrs. Kringle has that impish lap dog Tinkle but we all know that its anus was sewn shut from lawn dart incident last summer. No way she squeezed Tinkle's colostomy bag out on a car seat.

You are the prime suspect. 

2) **You knew that my father never locked his car doors.** I'm almost certain that you overheard my mother yell to my father to ""lock the doors"" on several occasions. The first time she yelled because someone took her collection of Wheat Pennies from the coin tray (She had every year sans 1948 and 1949) and the second time because someone turned on all the switches so when Dad got in everything was supposed to go haywire. But all that really happened was that the wipers started going, the hazards started blinking, and NPR was really loud. More like Lakshmi _Scream_.

Although my father's typical response to mom was that no person in their right mind would try to steal a 1984 Colt vista with a wooden bumper, it was mom's instincts that time has proven equitable.

3) **You were mad at my family** because my mother said you couldn't stay for dinner on Tuesday. We were having cornbread with ham &amp; 1000 bean soup, but because there wasn't enough food for you my parents asked you to go home. Who wants that crap anyway? I remember it was funny that I thought that because you stormed out of our house saying, ""Who wants that crap anyway?"" and my mom yelling ""LANGUAGE!"" as the door closed.

4) **The shit had corn bits in it.** Everyone in the neighborhood knows that your family feed pets table scraps, and it's widely known that you're starch junkies. And I know that starch is basically polymerized sugars which explains why all the kids in your family are off-the-wall. I once saw your youngest sister scale a giant oak tree and start chewing acorns. While they were still attached to the tree.

My father's reaction wasn't pleasant and his first order of business was to harangue me and my brother in to confessing who did it, as if one of us were somehow responsible. My father pisses me off sometimes but never to the point that I would build a pyramid of poo on his car seat. But he was convinced that if we didn't do it, we knew who _did_ and we were protecting their identity. I thought he was going to choke us. And to make matters worse, Mom, with a cynical smirk on her otherwise angelic face, shook her head at him and made the motion of a key being inserted in to a lock and turned. It was barbaric!

Because we're too poor to keep a set of latex gloves readily available, my father resorted to turning plastic shopping bags inside-out to expunge the excrement.

Dad is a salesman and because he doesn't have many material things (like latex gloves), he cherishes his business suits. He's the kind of guy who starches his shirts, keeps wooden shoe forms in his dress shoes, and refuses to fold his socks -- rather stacks them supine in the drawer ""so they don't wrinkle.""

He refused to clean shit or drive the car while wearing his business slacks.

This led me to explain to Mrs. Kringle that morning why my father was pantsless on the sidewalk beside a pile of shit. She's a godly old woman and it was hard to explain, so I made up a tale about Satan spiritually attacking our family with dog shit. This seemed like a reasonable explanation to her because she nodded her head almost as if to say, ""Yes, I've seen such evil things."" Dumb old bitch.

Although it's been weeks since the incident, my father still drives while sitting atop phonebooks. The smell is awful, and to make matters worse, my mother rolls up the windows and locks the doors at night for fear of a repeat incident. Dad asked why she can't leave a crack in the windows so the car can aerate. ""Not like they're going to squeeze dog shit through that little crevice!"" he said. 

""LANGUAGE!"" 

Every morning on the way to school the odor reminds me of a kennel and we leave a break of dog-dung aroma in our path. When I'm sitting in the back seat I can see other drivers faces contort and their heads swivel as they search for the culprit of this stench. ""Are we near a treatment plant?"" they must be asking. The smell is often too foul for me to stomach, so I'm forced to stick my head out the window. Like a dog. _Shitty irony_.

I had a notion it was you, but I knew it for sure when you gave me a pine cone air freshener and pursed your lips. I'll be watching you. And I'll be watching your dogs take a shit.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,True,,,True,t3_bc488,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/bc488/ill_be_watching_your_dogs_take_a_shit/,

""It's not a sob story,"" I protest. ""I just want you to understand why I feel the things I feel.""
""Sometimes I think you just need to be checked for some kind of mental disorder."" 
Five minutes passed as I continued to brush her hair. Finally I broke the stillness and whispered to her. 
""Are you still afraid of me?"" I breathed.
A soft nod was all that she managed to show. That was the worst pain of all. I kissed her on the head as I got up to go but I felt her quiver upon the touch of my lips. It was difficult to get up and go to my car with my heart dragging me down the whole way. I still needed to get gas. Coming to see her before I left town again used the last of the gallon that I had. 

Before making it to the gas station I saw a trooper waiting with his lights on pointed towards the speed trap. He would find his man. Tonight it would not be me. My mother gave me her debit card to use for gas. We weren't extensively wealthy but she felt that if she didn't buy me gas I would stay at school across state. She enjoyed spending time with me so she would make sure I had a way to come see her. 

I reminded my mother of my father. Before he became self absorbed, sheltered, and cynical. I loved my relationship with her but I often knew how much of a burden I was being financially. An engineering degree isn't free and every day I felt like I was leeching the life from her. As the debit card failed to make a transaction the realization struck me harder than it had before. I took out the cash I had to pay for the gas instead. Ashamed that I had ever thought about using her card, I quickly shuffled it into my back pocket behind my wallet closest to my body. 

As I pumped gas I thought about the money I had saved. I was trying to buy this girl that I loved an engagement ring but she was incapable of just listening to me. I didn't need responses. All I ever really wanted was someone to just listen and make me feel like I was normal and I had normal problems with normal thoughts. 

Earlier in the night she yelled at me while I was trying to talk to her. 

""OKAY FINE. I UNDERSTAND. IT'S ALL MY FAULT THAT YOUR STUPID TOY WON'T WORK.""

""You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me. It's not your fault that 5 people are on Facebook at the same time. I'm just trying to tell you that I get stressed out that things only work when I'm alone with no one else around.""

""Whatever,"" she mumbled under her breath. 

I looked down and saw my fist clenched as I sat beside her. Why was it in a fist? In that instance I saw the consequences of a clinched fist. I saw her crying with bruises on her face. I saw my head splattered on the floor as her father battered me with his college bat. I saw all the paths that a fist would lead me and rushed back to the noise of the present and watched my hands relax. 

As I drove home I pondered these things in my heart. How could I confidently marry anyone at this point. Especially someone who was afraid of me. Afraid of what I'd do. Couldn't do. Never do. Could never do to her. 

I saw the lights of a truck hurrying up behind me. It was late and must kids had curfews to meet. He sped up and passed. Either he didn't know about the stop sign or he didn't care that it was coming up. The truck continued at the same pace through the intersection. At the same moment a tractor trailer was passing through the intersection.

1376727258.0,2,self.shortstories,1kjhuj,The Gift Bag,khud44,2,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kjhuj/the_gift_bag/,"Jerry Chavez hardly ever said a word. A damn shame because he knew so many good ones. Lascivious, licentious, and lethargic all laid latent. He even invented some new ones that would have been a boon to society:

 

Escube:  to get ready for the day at work or a night out on the town by  shitting, showering, and shaving

(hygienically speaking the best order to perform them in).

Potanic: any item possessing the potency of Titanic proportions.

 

Yet, Jerry's laconic manner cursed the air with the language of a mundane nature: shit, fuck, double-fuck, cock, bitch, hell, that 'c' word, Jesus, and sugar. All paltry words and a pantry one too.

Jerry would spend most of his time creating the most wonderful worlds. Staying alive it might seem only to live in his daydreams. That was until the gift bag came.

Jerry, returning to his cheap motel-style apartment complex from an appointment with a doctor, found a lavishly adorned gift bag on his welcome mat. “Is it my birthday,” he thought. Jerry looked at his watch. “No, much too cold to be my birthday.” Truly placing a temperature gauge on a watch is a brilliant idea, you are able to see how cold it is outside which helps you to realize if you have dressed appropriately. Or in this case it helped Jerry realize that this present was too early or much too late for his July birthday. Without a reason for the gift bag coming to mind Jerry still took it into his somnolently decorated apartment. Jerry was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth, mainly because the giving of horses as presents seemed to have fallen out of fashion. At least that is in the circles Jerry ran in. Although the only circles Jerry ran in was down at the high school. But this was not a horse track. And obviously it's not the right track for getting a horse either. But I digress, actually looking back on how long that tangent was it would be more appropriate to say I trigressed or even quadgressed. 

Jerry in the meantime had grabbed himself a beer and sat down on his couch with the gift bag. He said something to himself which I intend was “Go for it you pussy.” and then he opened the gift bag. The first thing he found was what seemed to be a normal everyday yellow, Ticonderoga, number 2 pencil. Next was a brown leather bound journal, with which one would assume was to be written in with the pencil. The card followed. Jerry opened it with no haste, and read only this:

What you write with this Pencil into this Journal will come

true in that you will be able to fully participate in it so long

as you pop one of those Purple Pills.

Jerry daunted but determined checked the back of the card. Exactly as he thought, it was not a Hallmark. He now turned his attention to the dilemma of the pills. That is, where are they? The card's removal had emptied the gift bag. But as Jerry went to grab the bag again he heard the distinct sound of pills rattling in a bottle. And there they were. The purple pills were in his left hand.

Jerry removed the magic lid from the magic bottle, and took out the magic cotton swab, and grabbed a magic pill. Jerry said something silently to himself which I intend was “Hell, why not.” and then swallowed the pill with the help of a swig from his beer bottle.

Its taste was not bad. Jerry now felt he had done something wrong. Maybe, he was to have written first. But before he was to become too worried a story came to him and he began to write. 

It was a very good story. In the vein of Rip Van Winkle. A young lad, who Jerry would play, fell asleep on top of a hill overlooking a dystopian city. He was very unhappy in this world. He wished he could change it not just for himself, but for all. When the young man awoke he found himself on top of the hill looking down though on an unfamiliar city. He came down from his mount and walked around this new and as he found better city. Being quite confused he rested on a park bench. An old man seeing this unnerved young man sat down beside him hoping he could assuage the youth's pain. Jerry told him about the world he came from and how happy and surprised he was to see this one. Jerry asked how it became such and how it maintained its wonderfulness. The old man, who was quite knowledgeable, told him the story. He told the version that was not too long to allow the listener to become uninterested and not too short as to leave anything of importance out. It was a very good story and at the end of this he asked Jerry a question, “Shouldn't you be on your way?”

“To where?” Jerry replied.

“Home.” said the old man. Jerry paused. He believed senility had finally caught up to the old man. 

“I have no home here.”

This made the old man smile making Jerry now certain of the old man's brain being gone. The old man said, “Then maybe here is not the place you should stay. Your home is there. You might want to go back and share with others the story that you have found here.”

Upon hearing this Jerry knew what he must do. He would return to his dystopian world and share this gift, the one he was given, with others.

As great as this would have been you must already know that this is not what happened. Our world has no magic pencil or magic paper. Neither does it have magic pills. Just regular pills which purpose is to help. The kind you might get after an appointment with a psychiatrist. Pencils and journals with which we can write our feelings and thoughts in and one day share with others.

No, Jerry never came back to our world. Damn shame too for he had so many wonderful stories to tell.

Ask this once and you get a confident answer. Ask again: a confused answer. Ask three times and you'll be doubting their answer.


But just ask again and they start to doubt their own answer.


""Are you sure?""

No. I'm not sure. Not any more.


Ask this every time and they'll doubt all of their answers, doubtful of the very last word you can hear.


So ask for confirmation. Go ahead and ask if they're sure, because it's so important that you know.


That's how you destroy a person's confidence.


A question at a time, you doubt every word they say. And in every opinion, they strip their spoken words down to bare facts.


Because opinions are doubtful. How dare they say something they feel!


No more ""I think""s, because that's nothing to be sure of.


How dare they think.


You think you have paid the bills, but have you?


They can't answer the question with their thoughts, so they check.


But it's not just the words they say that they're unsure of. It's the very act of living they suddenly forgot is theirs.


You took it from them.


Are they sure that they have their wallet?


No. That hefty lead-weight in their back right pocket wasn't confirmation enough.

No. The fat wallet pulling their jeans uncomfortably taut can't possibly confirm it's there.


So no, they're not sure.


It should be there. They're not sure about that, but since you asked, they feel for their wallet. And they felt it. It's been there the whole time.


But now they don't know if they have their car keys, or if their jeans were zipped.


So they look.


They check. Every damned time, they'll check, because you asked.


They're not sure of what they're saying any more. Why are their thoughts no longer theirs?


They're no longer sure if they can live a day without forgetting something.


But they weren't ever inherently forgetful or unsure.


No, you made them that way.


Because you had to know.


So you asked.


And they answered.


No, they're not sure. They'll never be sure again.


On their way out the door, they'll only be sure they left their wallet behind. One time, they actually did.

1376567185.0,1,self.shortstories,1kevor,Shine,blue-leviathan,3,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kevor/shine/,"my life seems to be in a perpetual state of crumbling decay. I sometimes wander to safe, untouched parts of my life. But those places don’t stay pristine for long as slowly, but surely, the same decay that existed in my previous experiences begins to destroy anything that shines in my life. It seems as though everything in my life has a dull, lackluster coating. Even the sun once warming rays seem to just push me away, as if trying to keep me from infecting anyone elses lives with my disease. But I don’t want to die.

I wish I could say I wasn’t always this way. I wish I could point to the time, the event, that brought me to this lonely state... but sadly no matter how far back I look, my life seems to be haunted by this slow decay. My only rest came from escapes to other worlds through various medias. Movies were the first. I could get lost in the action on the screen, the issues the actors had became my issues. But the illusion would always end quickly and abruptly. And soon after the same state of depression would settle in, only to remind me that my life and world will never be like the one I just experienced. About the same time as I was getting into movies, I picked up reading and video games. This also helped to transport me to new and exciting worlds that haven’t been corrupted by my presence. Books in a series became a drug. I would read one book after another, faster and faster, trying to experience so much of this new world that it might hopefully drown the one I currently exist in. Waiting for the next one to be released was hell. I would try to read ones I had already finished, much like a heroine addict using an old needle trying to get any remaining drops into his system. But then it happened. I finished the final chapter of the final book in the series I cared most about. The world was over. Sure I could daydream about what the character were doing, but it would be in a world that I create, and doomed to be destroyed by my infection.

The author had unknowingly and unintentionally sent me to hell. I tried to reconcile by watching new movies, but with each credit roll of every film I watched I sank further into despair. For each film watched was another world lost or doomed to be devoured by my crushing darkness. But there was hope. I still don’t want to die. Video games seemed to sustain my thirst for the longest but weren’t quite as strong as movies and books as the persons populating the world had trouble with believability. But a renaissance of sorts happened in the video game world, where suddenly characters acted like people. One series in particular caught my attention. It’s world was filled with people you cared about. And they followed you through all three games of the series and game you reasons to care about said individuals. It was amazing. And then it ended... In a blaze of glory for the betterment of everyone, I gave all to save all. Sure, it was just my video game avatar that died. But it took what feels like the rest of my soul with it. The end of that series took away good friends. Friends that I could always talk to. A best friend that followed me through thick and thin. A significant other that always wanted me safe. And all of it was wiped away. It took away such a huge part of me that I refused to believe that it actually happened. That there was some, secret ending that revealed another game was coming out.

But it never came. My hero died, *but I didn’t want to die.* That series was the nail on the coffin. Now every medium I used to escape was tainted. I’ve gone from movie, to book, to video game, trying to capture what I know I once felt. But the corrosion always seems to arrive the moment I land on some other world. It’s maddening. I’ve been contemplating of other actions that can numb my mind to what's around me, but I know these methods will only bring me back to the same place I started, or someplace worse. But I still don’t want to die. At least I don’t think so. I have noticed that I made a rather frightening purchase a while ago. I bought a pistol. Impulse. I had no intention of buying it, but for some reason I was drawn to it. Something about how the metal’s hint of shine. A shine that reminded me of a place I had been before. A part of my life that was once filled with such hope. It felt natural in my hands. Not too heavy, but definitely sturdy enough for heavy use.

I bought it and a case of ammo. Like all new things I buy, I tend to open them up in the car on the way home. It’s a sense of excitement that everyone feel when they purchase a new toy of sorts. by the time I arrived home, I had already loaded a full magazine and had placed one round in the other. I left the gun in my car, bringing only one magazine with me into my home. Fast forward a few days. I was having trouble sleeping one night, so I decided to go for a drive. I drove for a few hours out to the middle of nowhere. I had a blanket in the back for emergency purposes, but decided to pull it out, lay on the ground, and watch the stars. And there it was. The cold black metal slightly reflecting the interior car lights. I grabbed the handgun, the reason I told myself that an animal might attack me and I don’t want to die. So I layed there on the blanket, back on the ground, eyes to the sky. And gun still in hand.

I layed there in silence and without a thought for about an hour when I first noticed it. *I don’t want to die*. It was a phrase that I had said all my life. It was just something I would repeat in my head without any real reason for being said. But for the first time, I noticed it wasn’t just a simple statement; It was a reply. I spoke it again, this time outloud. *“I don’t want to die.”*  I could feel my hand tighten around the grip of gun. *“I Don’t Want to Die.”*  I sat up with the gun in my lap, shining with the light of the moon and stars. *“I DON'T WANT TO DIE.”*  The gun sat there. Tempting me with it’s shine, a shine I wanted so dearly in my life. Multiple thoughts were racing through my head at this point. Phrases “Do it! You deserve this rest! End your suffering!” coursed through my mind. Were these thoughts always there? Were they caused by my corrosive curse? Or were they the very thoughts that caused the pain I was in? ***“I DON’T WANT TO DIE!”*** The barrel felt cold, lifeless. And in one fell motion, I threw the gun away from myself. *“I don’t want to die... I don’t want to die...”* Sweating, I repeated the phrase over and over. *“I don’t want to die... I don’t want to die...”*

I drove home with the radio off that morning, gun in the passenger seat. When I got home, I pulled the bullet out of the magazine, placed the gun and magazines in the safe, and lost the key. I don’t know why I didn't just leave the gun. The bullet... well... I've made it safe. Pulled the primer and drained the powder through drilled holes on the side. Engraved my name in the copper, pulled a string through the new holes and made a necklace out of it. I could have died that night. This necklace helps me remember that I was stronger than that. This bullet was meant to end my life, but now I hope it gives me strength to keep it. It’s got a certain shine...  *“and I don’t want to die...”*

Squirrels climbed over the piles of rubble, either completely oblivious or simply unconcerned with what that rubble could have been just a couple years back. Blue birds flew in the same patterns they did before, paying no attention to the fact that their shit was landing on history itself: on cobblestones and marble columns that could have been testaments to the collective knowledge of those who were here just a bit ago, yet so long ago as well.

 
It’s been said that the Earth is resilient and that, when left to run its course, nature fixes all. Perhaps someone would even say that that is exactly what happened, and that although the course can seem amoral and even outright wicked at times, it is nature’s course nonetheless and that it exists in a plane above all questioning. But of course, no one said that. 


No one, especially not the only sign of this past world that remained, the sulking frame of muscle and bones and dried-out hair that was currently bathing at the bottom of a nearby waterfall. No, he, (and he is certainly an accurate term to describe this embodiment of animalistic masculinity) was more concerned with removing the foreign, black, sticky thing that seemed to have a death-grip on his foot. The deer were likely to cross the same path they do at this time every day, and he had to be rid of all distractions, poised and ready to pounce. Sadly for our primal protagonist, he was indeed too late and was forced to come to terms with the reality that he would be entering another growling match with his stomach tonight.


But this realization would go on to be as unfulfilled as the aforementioned one, for this night was not like the other nights. The squirrels still climbed and the birds still shit, but a disturbance had come to enter this formerly peaceful land. He was unable to sleep, and found himself staring at the sky, waiting for his fat, yellow friend to come back and tell him that the world was safe again.



Indeed the sun did return, as it always promised it would, even after the End. He did as he always did too, and followed his instincts to the tallest rocks he could see. There, as he approached the peak of the stony mountain before him, did a figure enter his view. It was like him, with meat and bone and hair, but different too. This figure had strange bulges at the chest and in its eyes was a longing that he would have said felt like coming home, if he could remember how to say that or knew what a home was. 


And then, something magical happened. For the first time in a very long time, his mouth managed to form a very old word. Finally, he forced his throat to let it out.

	“Adam,” he said.

	She smiled coyly. “Eve.”

And so it Began.

After many months of research and exploration, I have found the flower of your request. The purple Xavier is a difficult beast to conquer, and its indigenous name is forbidden to be written on paper. I feel it necessary to respect the tribe that has hosted me these long three months, when we meet again I will delightfully tell you it's beautiful name. The tribe leader Caucunau allowed me to enter their sacred nest of the flower. they had raised the flower for 5 years and the shaman had estimated that its potency was at a near lethal dose. When the flower dies the shaman consumes it and speaks to the elders of times passed. Believe me Julius , if I was the type of man to steal the flower and run off into the night , my journey would have ended soon after my arrival. So I had to spend all these months looking for one in the wild.

This flower is a peculiar one, its stubborn,resourceful and quite random with its grow rates and habitation. My crew and I cut through 6 miles of jungle before we found it in the moon light, it had attached itself to the bottom of a fallen tree, and if it was not for its purple glow we would not have found it in that black void . We could not take its seeds and the shaman cut the flower in such a way that it could possibly survive while leaving me a lot to send to you. The tribe members assisting us confiscated our maps and blindfolded me and my two Mexican assistants and led us back to the village. This flower is so sacred to them that I believe they would burn the forrest down to protect it.

Julius this flower is my hearts gift to you. If I wasn't sure of its qualities I would not have trekked so far for so long. I know losing you brother took a toll on you unbearable to most men. How you are able to function is beyond me. I know the nights haunt you, I believe that things correlate with each other and it is only fitting that in order to cure your terror of the night is to trek far into the blackest depths of the Amazonian night. Your brother felt the same way about things, that's how we connected at first. It was my favorite quality of his, although later in life I came to love him for his sophisticated passion for life and knowledge, as well as his never ending sense of hope and kindness.

I spoke with the shaman many nights, and we discussed your brother and his untimely death that caused your unrelenting depression. He wrote you a guide for when the flower consumes you and become one. It is ensribed in this letter below the indigestion instructions.

The last night I was in the village , I was offered to smoke a small portion of the flower, but I went with my better judgement to avoid its mystic powers. Below is the shamans guide for consumption.

 1 Take the flower and let it soak in cold water for 3 hours, save the water the flower was sitting in

 2  mash and chop the flower into a finely cut mush.

 3 let it sun dry till complete dry

 4 Soak and redry for about 4 times

 5 Once dried , separate into 3 even sections.

 6 On a full stomach consume the water
 
 7 Over the periode of one hour smoke all three piles.

 8 Expect results within the second hour.

The shaman said to expect extreme colors and visions for an indefinite periode of time , he said to expect to see the elders, Gaint beings of light that speak like the rumblings of mountains. He said to expect to be transported into another dimension and to be carried throughout the universe and to be taught great and powerful things. They will teach you how to overcome the loss of your brother and to help others in life. The most important thing he told me was to stay strong, the visions will sense your fears and you could spend a life time in the land of the dead. Then wake up a few hours later.

As you are reading this letter I am already on my way back to the states. I expect to hear all about your cosmic voyage once I return.

They had long escaped the far reaching echos of shouting guards through the streets and outpaced the speeder teams through the derelict and cratered slums at the edges of San Francisco, but they still ran, armour thudding on the cracked and abandoned tarmac with every long stride. It began to rain, mud began to fill the cracks in the road and every step was accompanied by a splash until at long last the pair had reached their destination. It was once a grand hotel, dozens of stories tall, but the war had seen an end to it, with most of the windows blown out and boarded up, the place was abandoned, a dying steel and stone skyscraper. The two entered the wounded behemoth with a careful tread. They clomped up the stairwell, boots grinding against the concrete until they reached a large door labeled, ""Floor Twenty Nine"". The taller of the two raised a gauntleted fist to the door and it clicked open. They stepped through the doorway and the door clicked behind them. The room was black from the overcast sky, and the shadows of the building, and the black marble of the ceiling and the floor. Faint lights flickered from a bank of computers in the corner, and their boots clinked on the ground as they turned to face each other. Their armour was matte black, both illuminated by sets of colored streaks. One red, one blue.


*****


   The armoured figure illuminated in blue dropped to their knee, head bowed before their partner. The taller shadowrunner in red gently grasped the helmet of their partner and disengaged the EV seals with a faint pop-hiss. They tugged the helm off and placed it on the ground, letting their partner breathe unfiltered air once more. She looked up at him, impassive face lit blue in the darkness, eyes smiling up at the faceless visor. She didn't look like an assassin, a mercenary or a wanted criminal, but more like an artist, or a singer. That didn't change the facts. Blonde hair skittering over her armour, she grabbed her partners hand and lifted herself up as the other knelt down. Gauntlets enclosed the helmet and the seals cracked open, and she slid the helmet off carefully. He looked up at her with dark eyes and a look of calm on his face before lifting himself off the ground to meet her. He had the look of a man saddened by tragedy, harrowed and heavy, looking like a surgeon instead of a murderer, a spy and a shadowrunner. He turned around, arms out from his sides and she slipped his and her gauntlets off, revealing the pale skin underneath. She worked on his armour, working past clips and velcro straps, fingers dancing over his muscles through his skinsuit before finally loosening the plating on his arms enough to slide off. She tapped his shoulder and turned around, letting him reciprocate her efforts. He went about the task almost reverently, leaving no room for force or frustration, like it was a practised art.


*****


   As he set the plates on the ground she turned around, beginning to drop to her knees. She unstrapped his boots and pulled them off, turning her attention to the black plates covering his legs. Each lace was tied in a delicate but strong knot, and her hands traced over the familiar ground undoing each string with a rapid precision, tearing off velcro and gingerly setting each piece on the marble floor. She finished her work on the other leg and stood up.


*****


   ""Take off my chestplate."" He said, voice quiet but strong, reverberating through the wide open chamber.
She looked at him, but said nothing as her fingers clicked over the studs securing the armour together. It popped and the rigid plates went slack, slipping off over the shadowrunner's head. His companion looked at him confused for a moment, then realized why he had done it. As he went to work on finishing removing her plating she stood in honour and wonder. He had made himself vulnerable, made himself lesser than another, and willingly. He trusted her with his life.


*****


As the last plate clinked on the ground, he walked off to the computer to finish their work. She stood at the edge of the building, thinking about him and what they had accomplished that day, thinking about the dozens they had killed and the dozens they were to kill.
She looked out at the ocean, towards the storm that was coming in.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1375800618.0,,,True,t3_1jt9y6,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jt9y6/the_run/,

1375585625.0,1,self.shortstories,1jntnr,Reflection,Soulturin,2,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jntnr/reflection/,"Day 1

I wake in the morning, content and comfortable under the warm covers of my bed. I have a whole week away from work, and I honestly cannot remember the last time I felt so relaxed. I have cut myself off from the world, just for a few days, just so I can have some well-deserved time to myself. I think I deserve that much.

I dreamed of Jennifer last night. It was the best dream I have had in a long time, in fact, I think it may be the only dream I've had in a long time; most of my nights are filled with nothing but empty space and darkness. I wonder where she is… travelling, most likely, but who knows where?

After a good few hours lying in bed, I finally manage to pull myself out from under the heaps of quilts and cushions and head to the kitchen. I allow myself to indulge my craving for waffles. I bathe them in syrup and eat them as if they are about to be taken away from me. My mind wanders back to work, but I quickly shut out the thought, I dare not let thoughts of work interrupt my stress-free holiday.

I make my way to the bathroom; I could really use a nice, hot shower. As I flick on the light switch I notice the room is unnaturally cold. All of the heating is on, and had been left on all night… how could it be cold? It doesn't matter. A shower will soon fix the issue. I take a look at myself in the mirror. My reflection stares back at me. There is something indeterminably odd about my appearance; I don’t quite look like myself. I move away from the mirror a few steps. My reflection stays still.

I feel my heart begin to thrum in my chest, like it is trying to break free of my rib-cage. My throat has gone dry, and I struggle to catch my breath. None of that matters though. I stare at my reflection, and my reflection stares back. In horror, I watch as my mouth utters the words ‘you did this, you son of a bitch’ and the words actually come out. My reflection pulls a gun from somewhere out of the frame and aims at the roof of its mouth. I pull the trigger.

I see my brains erupt from my skull, and fall out of frame; then comes the blood. I watch it creep out from under my hairline and trickle down my forehead and into my eyeballs and my mouth. I can almost taste the bitter tang of copper on my tongue.

This isn't real.

It can’t be happening.

I close my eyes, and when I open them, my reflection is just me again. Just me. I stumble into the shower and attempt to wash away the memory of what I saw.

Later that night, when I return to bed, I don’t dream as usual, but the darkness that comes with sleep is illuminated by flames, and the light shines on a mass of faceless corpses.

Day 2

I wake up with a headache. My sleep was uneasy, and I woke up several times during the night. I decide to give the bathroom a wide berth for a while; I have a certain, understandable reluctance to visit that particular room today.

I decide to make waffles for breakfast again, in the hope I can find some solace in repetition and routine, and somehow kid the world into believing I wasn't disturbed by what I witnessed. Maybe I just imagined it, maybe I was still dreaming. Like any of it matters. I choke down some aspirin with breakfast and the pain in my head subsides somewhat, but it still lingers there, hidden away behind my eyes.

I know I’m going to have to go to the bathroom. It has to happen at some point. It might as well be now. I slowly open the door, and it responds with a frustratingly eerie creaking noise. I flick the light switch, expecting the worst, but the room is warm, and just like that my anxiety is gone. Still; I haven’t forgotten the mirror hanging from the wall. I make the conscious decision not to look; I will not feed a delusion, or a hallucination, or whatever the hell it was. I turn on the shower and step in, letting the hot water smother me.

By the time I’m finished, everything seems to be back to normal, my fears have subsided at last. I think about Jennifer again, maybe I should give her a call? It couldn't hurt, it might even help… No, I promised myself just a few days free of stress. Jennifer could wait a few more days.

I step out of the shower and unthinkingly look into the steamed up mirror. The image isn't clear, but somehow, that makes it all the more horrifying. I can see myself swinging. A makeshift noose is tied around my neck and I am drifting lazily, side to side. As the condensation clears, the image becomes more and more visible, and more and more grotesque. My face is puffy and disfigured, and purple, my eyes crusty with dried blood. There is bile dribbling from the corner of my swollen mouth and my lips are cracked and dry, the noose itself is digging into my neck and ripping at the flesh there, I notice that the rope is red, stained with my blood.

This isn't real. It CAN’T be real.

I smash my fist into the glass and hear it shatter before I feel the impact. I pull my fist back and throw it at the mirror again. I repeat the motion, over and over, until I am lying on the bathroom floor among the shards of glass, panting, wheezing; breathless. My knuckles are bleeding, but I don’t feel any pain. I’m too in shock to feel any pain.

I manage to pull myself from the bathroom floor, and when I do, I make the decision to call Jennifer. I need her now more than ever. The phone rings, but no-one answers. I try several more times, but in the end I just leave a message. I hope she calls back. I need her to call back.

Sleep. The nightmares are worse tonight. I can see the faces of the corpses now, but I wish I couldn't  I can hear screaming, loud; as if it someone has their mouth pressed against my ear, and is wailing at full volume. The worst part? I can’t wake up. No matter how bad it gets. I cannot wake up. Please… I’m begging you. Let me wake up.

Day 3

Being able to open my eyes is a relief, but only temporarily. The room is swaying. Everything seems to be out of place. Maybe I am just disorientated, or maybe everything had moved, I honestly cannot tell. I am struggling to tell if this is even reality at all, I am awake, but maybe my mind has lingered in the realm of dreams. More like nightmares.

I stumble to the kitchen, and smash several objects on the way, when I finally sit down, the sensation does not die. The thought of food repulses me. Even waffles makes me feel sick to the stomach, I know that if I even try to eat a bite I will immediately throw it back up. I try calling Jennifer again, but I only reach her answer message, where is she? I run my hands through my hair, I have a headache again, and my throat feels drier than it ever did. I grab myself a glass of water, and do my best to drink it, although finding my mouth seems to be something of a challenge. The water helps moisten my throat, but my headache persists, even after I have swallowed an excess of painkillers.

I don’t want to. But I know I have to… it is the only thing that could hold the answer to whatever is going on here, but oddly, I feel strangely eager to see my reflection again, I know he will be waiting for me, like an old friend…

There is another mirror in the hallway. I will have to do it.

My reflection seems normal for a moment, but it doesn't take long for that to change. I watch as I pull a knife from my pocket and bring it to my throat. I slowly slice at my neck, and the blood pours out, spurting, shooting in every direction. My reflection stays standing still, as if nothing had ever happened. I return its dead stare. Then, I hear myself speak, with a rasping, guttural, gurgling voice- a voice which only a man with a sliced throat could possess.

“You did this to me- to us- to yourself.”

“How have I done this?”

“You cursed us.”

“I don’t understand, what have I done to deserve this?”

“You don’t remember, do you?” I hear myself say, “that must be nice- ignorance truly is bliss- allow me to throw light on our situation- we are living a cursed life, we feared death and so we sold our soul so that we could live, but you do not make a deal with the devil lightly, for he will always have the upper hand.”

“What do you mean?”

“You live a normal life until the moment you are most happy, most content, when you feel as though there is no fault with the world- and that is when it starts- that is when the nightmares begin, that is when we appear, and we will not go away until you end it all. If you do not do so, things only get worse, the visions will grow more lifelike with every passing day, the earth will begin to tremble around you, all of your senses will betray you, the people you love most in this world will die, and they will burn, and they will suffer, until you have nothing left in this world, nothing but the vapid darkness of death. Then, once you have killed yourself, you are reborn, and the cycle begins again, but you won’t remember. You wished for immortality- you have it.”

“I never wanted this!”

I see my dead eyes stare back at me with contempt. I realise that there is only one option. I call Jennifer one last time, and leave her a message.

“I’m sorry.”


I open my medicine cabinet and take all of the pills I have. I fill another glass with water and begin to swallow them, by the handful, until there are none left. I walk slowly to the mirror, and look at my reflection. I am overwhelmed with self-pity, even though I know I don’t deserve any, and I begin to cry. But it doesn't last long. Soon, I can feel the room slipping away. I watch as my reflection begins frothing at the mouth, and I see my eyes roll to the back of my head. As I fall to the floor I embrace the cold arms of death and promise myself that in my next life I will remember, I will prepare myself for the worse, but I know as life slips away from me that I am only kidding myself, and that salvation is nothing but a fantasy.

It was dark and the disfigured shapes of naked trees danced around him. Their branches brought to life by the wind seemed to reach for him with gruesomely long and slender fingers. The rain collecting in puddles and streaming along the fallen branches, rocks and tentacle-like roots made them look like crawling creatures from the underworld that were always hiding under the cover of darkness. There were no stars and the moon was blocked by thick clouds that were pouring over the sky like a river of melting tar. The only light present was the one glistening in his blue eyes. It was truely an unsettling and spooky place to be this time of night, but he couldn’t enjoy anything more than going hunting in a night like this.
   Steam rose from his wet skin as he was standing in the mucky water and listening for a prey. The constant shower of rain filled the air with a damp smell of mud and the sound of whispers from far away. Then he heard it. Something was out there… and it was his to play with. He closed his eyes and inhaled a deep breath opening his claw-like hands eager to drive them through his victim. 
   He crouched and leaned forward targeting the prey. He didn’t have that much problem seeing at night so he knew exactly where to go. He moved swiftly and without a sound like a shadow blending with the darkness. As he was getting closer he jumped over a large tree that had fallen long time ago and landed on his hands making a silent roll in the wet mud. Soon after he rose, the rain had already washed away the dirt and he continued the chase. Finally he was close enough to hear a heartbeat. It was raging fast as the owner of it fled through the woods, jumping over fallen trees, running around bushes and occasionally tripping over various objects including her own feet.
   He paused to take a better look at what he was chasing and as he did his eyes brightened. If anybody had been looking his way, they would have seen a pair of dark blue eyes burning in the night and nothing more. 
   Once he knew what he was up against he chose to sneak past the girl and attack from the front – face on. No grabbing by the leg or any other cowardly moves. It shouldn’t be too difficult, he thought. After all, he was much faster, didn’t make a lot of noise and had a great night vision. The hunt was on.
   He picked up his pace maneuvering through the woods, sometimes jumping so high over things it seemed as gravity had no effect on him. The sound of rainfall overcame the sound of his steps and he started to enclose on the girl. She was now on his left, so close he could smell the adrenaline rushing through her veins and the smell was sweet. He couldn’t help but to look at her as they were running just a few pitch black feet aside from each other. And then she threw a look at him. Two bright blue eyes were glaring at her from the darkness so close she could have touched them. She turned away and lost all sense of reality while screaming until out of breath. 
   He should have closed his eyes before the girl saw them, but he didn’t and it made him regret he had moved so close to her before time. Now she had turned away from him and ran even faster. Still, this was no problem for an experienced hunter like himself. He leaped forward and smashed his claw in a tree to make a quick turn. He jumped up and swung from one tree to another with such power the bark fell to the ground like burned ash. He made his way over the girl and jumped forward extending his arms like a prowling hawk. He landed and rolled in a ball of black mist in front of her. Once he stopped he was facing her and leaped forward before she even came to what was happening. 
   He flew past her so close he wiped off some rain drops from her cheek. As he went by he started to rotate and behind him formed a black cloud that covered his feet. And finally he had the chance to rip his pray to pieces. His claws grew longer right before they slashed the demonic flesh of the slithering beast that had been tormenting the girl and chasing her through the forest. The beast was stunned, wounded and obviously angry. It let out a horrific howl that turned into chilling screams of every soul it had eaten and made a screeching sound by chomping and grinding its sharp teeth together. 
   The girl was frozen with fear but she wanted to run. It was a fearsome feeling but she was amazed by the two creatures. The dark creature with flaming blue eyes floating around followed by a cloud of darkness blocking her from the growling beast whose breath turned into white smoke. 
   The beast roared once more sending chills down her spine and attacked the dark creature trying to pulverize him with its horns. As soon as they got close, the blue-eyed creature span into a spiral around the demon creating a dark blue tornado lifting it up. He drilled his claw right through the demons chest and drove him to the ground. As he did, the dark spiral ended and blue light shone from his eyes and the hand penetrating the demon. Blue-eyed creature lifted his other hand to the sky and it too shone blue. Then suddenly waves of white lights traveled through his hands and went shooting for the sky. When the last soul had left the demons flesh Blue-eyed levitated above him and raised his hands that were radiating with blue light and then slammed them into the demon once more pushing him into the ground and out of this world. Then the light faded.
   Blue-eyed turned to the girl and smiled. That was the creepiest smile she had ever seen for it was given by a skeleton rabbit with long slender ears and burning blue eyes. But she smiled back and the creature disappeared in the dark.

I can hear sirens in the distance and mechanical exhales. Jim Morrison is still singing light my fire  loudly in the background. I hope they don't play it at my funeral, its 6 minutes 58 seconds long and id hate to bore anyone. I can't see but I'm not blind, I've watched too many movies to know that theres just a shit load of blood in my eyes. ""You know that it would be untrue"" My legs are mangled and most of teeth are embedded into the steering wheel. My right hand must gone through the wind screen, it feels like theres less parts than there were before. ""C'mon baby light my fire""; do cars actually explode? Who cares I'm fucking euphoric. 

The sirens get closer but still sound decades away. I cough up around a pint of blood and the remainder of my teeth that didn't end up in the wheel. The next song starts rolling, Bon Iver - Skinny Love.. honestly, who the fuck wants to die to that? With my healthy left hand I manage to find the untouched stereo and skip to the next track,  Anthony Green - Baby Girl. I can't help but grin. I must look like a fucking Jack o lantern. i start tapping away. I'd sing if i could move my jaw. 

So much is out of place ""Baby girl twist awaaaaayyy"" Im in desperate need of a chiropractor. ""When you're talking to me i can't breath"" My phone starts vibrating. My mother calls me every time she hears sirens, i tell her its silly. I wonder how the other poor fucker is. I should feel guilty but I'm just enjoying the song too much ""This common feeling ends when you enter, not many cigarretes left"" 

I can't stomach the smell of the fast food that was on the passenger seat and bring up more blood, a lot this time and i come close to passing out. I beg a fictional god like every dying atheist does for a quick ending and a ticket to heaven but soon pull myself together and realise that I'm being a dick. What happens next? Who gives a fuck? i doubt ill be judged on how lovely I am so i can relax about that. ""Meredith ill miss you when you go anywhere"" This makes me think about her for the remainder of the song. Not Meredith she's mr Greens lady, I'm thinking of my sweetheart. The only thing I've ever loved. She was a fucking psycho of course but nowhere near normal.

*Hit me.*

I raised my hand, and slapped her.

*Harder.*

Fuck. I gave her a kiss, and continued. Her exhortations of pleasure slowed, and ceased. I continued.

I rolled off and lay there, panting. Petting her hair, stroking her arm, sliding closer. She pulled away.

*Why didn’t you hit me?*

Well here’s the thing. I’m not overly familiar with the process OK? I have normal sex. For normal people.

She scoffed, getting out of bed.

Hey, sorry. I’ll try eh? You can teach me. Like a kinky sex teacher. Come here. 

Slowly she climbed back into bed. I held her, and kissed her. 

Fucking hell she was pretty. Dark hair, olive skin, enormous green eyes. Looked oddly like my mother’s. I put on some music and we smoked a cigarette. 

I got up early, thought I’d bring her breakfast in bed, be the sweet guy. Hopefully make up for my poor performance the night before. I beat the eggs, vigorously. Scrambled were her favourite. I finished up in the kitchen, grabbed the accoutrements and proceeded back to the bedroom. She was just stirring. I placed the eggs on the side of the bed and gave her a smile as her eyes opened. She smiled back.

This had never happened to me before. Years of repression, ignoring fantasies. Hey would you like to try…no? No that’s fine, just being with you is enough. They’d gone cold. I’d grown boring.

I remember meeting her at the train station. Her train arrived about a minute after mine. As I was organizing my bags I saw her walk through the station, tall and dark. She saw me looking and smiled. I remember well how she laughed at my vacuous jokes, humoured my vanities, permitted my flatteries. I took her for a beer, and kissed her within an hour of our meeting.

We did the dinners, the shows, the drinks. I courted her, like I’d courted other women. Then it became interesting.

*Tell me what you want.*

What I want? 

*What you want to do to me.*

Huh.

What did I want? I didn’t even know. Sex, I guess. It was good for a while, I made petty, basic requests, all of which she willfully obliged.  Then she started making requests. 

As a rule I don’t strike, hurt, or otherwise maltreat people. Then again no one had ever asked for it. The concept was new to me. I was a painfully slow learner, and a miserable practitioner. 

There was the hair pulling. I gripped it feebly, tugging at it like I was trying to open a stuck door. There was the slapping, which I apparently only ever did with insufficient enthusiasm. 

*Choke me.*

Uh.

*Just do it.*

I placed my hand on her throat, but quickly withdrew it.

*What?*

I can’t.

*Oh.*

We fucked in silence. She left soon after. I lit a cigarette and went for a walk.  Cigarettes do me such good. 

This was so strange, we talked and joked and laughed. She had great tastes in music, food, booze. Christ I actually liked this girl. Why was I so incapable of pleasuring her? I didn’t understand this masochistic bullshit. I lit another cigarette. 

There seems to me something inherently paradoxical about the desire to be so-called ‘submissive’ during coital engagements. She held all the cards. My inability to satisfy her left me a sort of sexual plebeian. A lower caste of lover.  She was my ‘dom’ in every sense.

She went to Toronto for the weekend. Our texts had been vapid and terse for some time. I spent the weekend drinking heavily, going out, flirting grotesquely with every woman who would permit me. I applied all the usual remedies. None of them worked. I texted her every so often, sometimes she even texted back. 

I resolved that, upon her return, I would pull my shit together. I’d do what she wanted. I watched violent porn. I tried to embitter myself to her. Tried to make myself want to hurt her. Add a little flavour to my bland dish. 

*Hey.*

Hey, how’s your weekend?

*Good. Listen, I think it’s only fair to tell you I fucked another guy this weekend.*

Oh? 

*Yeah. It won’t be the last time either.*

Oh.

I turned off my phone and went for a walk. The cigarette tasted like dirt in my mouth. I had never had any pretentions of exclusivity; still, it seemed to me an affirmation of my own sexual ineptitude. Some guy in Toronto satisfying her in a way I simply couldn’t. I walked through the park, past couples holding hands. They’d all likely go home, strip naked and fornicate in a prescribed and formulaic way. I’d go home alone.

They say vanilla is the finest of the flavours. Light, sweet. Boring. Consistently pleasant, readily available, never exciting.

*Fingers*

They sat across from each other in the dimly lit room. With his head down, he took her left hand in his and thoughtfully grazed his thumb over her fingers, brushing the ring on her middle finger.
  
“You don’t have room in your life for me.” 

She looked at him quizzically. He had changed in the short period of time they had come to know each other. When she first met him, she thought him wild and free. He seemed to be a breath of fresh air, come to sweep her away from her steadfast life. But there he sat, hunched over on the leather armchair with his slender arms outstretched towards her and his long fingers wrapped around her hand. 

A smile grew on her face. 

“Let me show you something.” 

She lifted her left hand out of his and slowly worked the ring off her middle finger. He looked at her gentle face with confusion as she slipped the ring onto the middle finger of her other hand.  

“There. Enough room?”

I wasn’t popular in school, I didn’t join in any extracurricular activities, I wasn’t good at anything. My parents were never home, so my youth was filled with tedious amounts of alone time; loneliness overflowed my conscious moments. I was practically dead inside by the age of 8. No one cared about me. Everyone has had those sad, depressing moments where they feel unloved and unwanted in a society. That was my childhood; an ocean of regret. By the age of 10, I was drowning in sorrow and there was no one to dive in and save me from the fog; no noose, knife or pill could ever save me from this abyss that was my life. One day when I was 12 years old, my father brought home a pet mouse. He told me it would keep me company for when I was lonely. After that, I was never truly alone. My mouse was the first thing that I had ever loved, he listened to my troubles, he wanted to get out of that hell-hole with me, he understood me. I loved that pet mouse more than anything, and the feeling was mutual. One afternoon, I noticed that my mouse was struggling to move as he normally would. He had suffered a broken leg while running around his cage. He looked like he was in pain, like he wanted to be free from that pain. I wanted to make him feel better. 


Freedom.


Something I loved died that night.

What is death? An eternal rest? The end of the life of a person or an organism? No. Death is freedom. We live in a treacherous world filled with corrupt men and murderers who wander the streets at will with a blatant disregard for others. People are disgusting creatures. The people I love are carefully selected from this group of traitorous humans, a needle in a haystack, a lotus surrounded by murky water. All I’ve ever wanted is to see the people I love happy. That’s all everyone ever wants to see. When they’re thankful for what you’ve done, that you’ve made their life a happier place. I’m a person who doesn’t love easily, but I think I’ve found it. There’s a feeling inside me that I’ve only felt once before. That feeling of the pet that listened, the mouse who cared. Now, I’m certainly not comparing Marie to a mouse, I’m just saying that they’re the only things that I’ve loved in my 23 years on this planet. Marie is beautiful, caring and thoughtful. She’s also the only person to ever look beyond my chipped crust of insecurities. It seems as though pain or suffering has never graced the presence of my perfect Marie. Which is nice to know that she was cared for. That she had friends. That she had parents who were home. That she was loved. 


Anger.
Pain.
Freedom.


Marie is always happy, I have never seen anything less than a smile on her face. Today was different. She ran into my arms bawling. I stood there astounded, as this is my debut as the role of a comforter. Choking down her tears, she tells me that her father is ill with a rare type of cancer. I stare off into the distance pondering this painful news. She says he’ll fight it the best he humanly can. Why? I think. Sickness is normal, no matter it being mild or severe. Why fight a deadly illness and not be around the ones you love when you can just accept it and live your life to the fullest with the designated amount of time you have left? Everyone has to die anyways. Young, old, male, female. Everyone and everything must die on this earth. So why attempt to prolong it for a few more tedious, painful years? 


Just be free from it. 

	
I invited Marie into my small apartment, tears continue to stream down her face. She sits on my white leather couch in the middle of the living room, head in her hands. She tells me she’s never gone through something like this before, the pain of a family member dying. She wishes her father was better, she wishes she wouldn’t be sad. The pain is too much for her. 


She wants to be free.


I go into my kitchen, and I grab a sharp knife. It feels lighter than normal, as if I could do anything with it. Not just cut fruits or vegetables, but promote freedom, release pain. I walk out of the kitchen and into the living room, where I see my perfect, beautiful, loving Marie sitting with her eyes closed. Trying to shut the pain and fear away. I walk up behind her, my instrument of happiness clenched tight in my hand.


“It’s going to be okay, Marie.” My arm reaches around, she doesn’t notice the knife hovering over her neck.

""Marie, let me help you.""

I slammed on the brakes, and was in turn slammed into my seatbelt as my BMW M3 slowed. my bumper stopped only inches short of the crosswalk, and a group of half-stoned teenagers cursed at me as they jumped back. I waved impatiently and revved my engine. The straight-six roared, like a savage creature under the hood was waiting to be unleashed. As soon as the light switched, I popped the clutch and the roadster shot forward. Five seconds later, I was roaring down the country road at sixty miles an hour. Loud as the engine was, however, it was drowned out by the screaming in my head. Because, truth be told, I was running away. Away from my home and my wife and everything I knew, with nothing in the trunk but a tire iron and a suitcase with clothes for three days. The last words she had spoken to me as I threw jeans and shirts into my bag rang in my head. “Bastard!” She had called me as I ran out the door, a glass of whiskey nearly missing my skull. “Shithead!” “Asshole!”  She said, over and over again in my head. Much as I tried to dredge up a memory, any memory of her that didn’t involve having profanity and heavy things thrown my way, I just couldn’t. So I ran. I ran to the driveway and my M3, throwing my suitcase in the back, banging my head on the opened trunk. I jumped in and turned on the engine and drove away and... Holy shit! 

The deer seemed to take flight, nearly missing the hood of my car as it ran into the woods. I shook my head and tried to concentrate on the road. By now, I realized, I was far into the mountains, farther than I had ever been. I had missed the turnoff which led to the interstate, and was heading deeper into the Arkansas highlands. The road was smoother now, but there was fog creeping onto the sides. I kept my high beams on to watch for deer, and opened my windows. The engine screamed through the straight pipes and, spurred on by the sound, I upshifted into fourth and took off, my tires rumbling and squealing over the asphalt. The road widened to four lanes, and just in time, because just as I came around a blind corner, there appeared an old Ford truck. As I came up behind it, I could hear its old engine straining to get up the hill. I flashed my signal and passed the old wreck and crested the hill. As I did, a set of headlamps flashed in my rearview. I flinched  as the lights disappeared behind me, only to flash again as the car they were attached to crested the hill a few hundred yards behind me. I looked over my shoulder to identify the car, but its lights suddenly turned off. Then I saw the Ford roll over the hill. Or, more accurately, what was left of the Ford. It was skidding on raw rims, its tires shredded and sparks flying in a grotesque fireworks display. The man behind the wheel had been blown away with a 12-gauge, and his blood obscured the windshield. The old truck flipped once as it slid off the road, landing in a thicket and catching fire as its gas tank ruptured. Over the cacophony of the crash, I heard the throaty growl of a big V8 through straight pipes. Even louder, though, was a banshee-like scream. Both were growing louder, and I decided to make my getaway. I planted my foot on the gas, and accelerated away. Even as my M3 put down its 333 horses, I could hear the other car coming on fast. I hit the brakes as I rounded a turn, and the shrieking only grew louder. As I came out of the turn, I got my first look at my pursuer. The car was a jet-black 1967 Camaro SS, its sliver racing stripes shining in the light of the full moon. The headlights abruptly came back on, and I could see skull-shaped cutouts over the lamps, throwing eerie white silhouettes on the road behind me. I cursed and dropped down a gear, my engine screaming as the car jumped forward. The Camaro shrieked as it accelerated. It had a monstrous hood scoop, and a silver glow emanated from inside. The muscle car swerved left, and came alongside me. I gunned my engine again, and pulled ahead. Then, and God help me for doing it, I saw the driver.

His head was smoky grey skeletal, with white fire blazing in his empty eye sockets. He wore a matte black firesuit, a skull-and-crossbones insignia adorning the shoulder. I looked, horrified, into the face of Death, and my vision tunneled. In a split second, I saw my family and friends standing by my graveside, growing older and dying before falling into the open pit. I blinked, but a vision of my wife appeared. She held a flaming stick, and cursed me as she swung it at my head. I screwed my eyes shut once again, and the shrieks of my dead friends were replaced with the banshee-scream of the supercharged car beside me. The death’s-headed driver looked at me and smiled, his moon-bleached teeth as bright as welding torches. He raised a black sawn-off shotgun, and I turned away, shifting into high gear and accelerating away. The Camaro was hot on my heels, but I could hear the wailing of his supercharger recede as I powered down the straightaway. His V8 roar mixed with the hair-raising sound of his supercharger,  but my car was faster through the corners, and I took full advantage. I could see Death, his evil, hollow face twisted into an angry grimace as he slammed on the gas. I hit the next corner hard, drifting around the hairpin as my rear tires spun and cried out in protest. I could hear myself cursing and screaming in abject terror as my tail end almost hit the guardrail, but I managed to recover and my tires miraculously regained traction. My straight-six belted out its gravelly song and, emboldened, I mashed the clutch and upshifted just as Death’s Camaro cleared the turn. He let his V8 do its work, putting down what had to be 500 horsepower, but I had the advantage this time. Looking down the road, I saw another hairpin corner leading into a long, winding descent. I stood on the brake and put the clutch in, sliding smoothly through the turn, and let the clutch out as I opened the throttle. My M3 screamed down the mountainside, leaving Death in the dust. I didn’t slow down for ten minutes, when the lights of my small town appeared around a shallow turn. I looked behind me and saw the black Camaro, stopped about a mile back, smoke coming out of its hood scoop. Death stood regally in the moonlight, his arm up in a terrifying salute. I turned the corner and, when I next looked back, the car and its driver had disappeared. 

I arrived back at my small house, and pulled the M3 into the driveway. I climbed out, a grin on my face. After all, I had just faced down Death and won.

The tiny, flickering light only lit up half of the already dark room. He stumbled around in the dark cursing until he finally found what he was looking for. He grabbed the box which lay hidden under a pile of old documents, its lid was broken and when he delicately opened it music began to play.

Inside was a tiny mirror which was shattered into pieces on the soft red velvet lining other than the shards of glass the music box was empty. He studied it for a second, his brain flickered as if it was struggling to remember something.

He grunted and threw the box to the floor where it was silenced. He carried on his search this time pulling out a drawer, again it was empty save for a few bits of scrap material he seized these like they were gold and stuffed them in his pockets.

There was a gold watch on the bedside cabinet which caught his eye he picked it up and twirled it round in his hand before stuffing it in his pockets. He picked up a photo album and let the pages drop, memories, that same flicker in his brain. He threw it in to the fire and watched the flames dance on its ashes, he sat on the floor, watching the fire, it made him feel satisfied. The room was now completely ransacked, he smiled to himself. The fire was going out and the flickering light had nearly given up on its life; he surveyed the room one last time before limping out of the cabin and into the darkness of the night.

1374676143.0,2,self.shortstories,1iyh1e,My First Short Story: Darkness,takamarou,2,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iyh1e/my_first_short_story_darkness/,"They say that darkness is the absence of light.  They make it sound as if darkness is something waiting to be filled - like an empty mug sitting next to a coffee pot.  They say this with all confidence, as if they've experienced every variation of darkness, and could never be surprised by it.  I would argue, though, that they've never seen darkness like this.


This is darkness so complete that it seems to be both expanding infinitely, and incessantly pressing down into you - consuming every available crevice.  This is darkness so thick that out of desperation you might reach your hand out in hopes of pushing it away to reveal light.  This is not a darkness that simply fills space that is devoid of light - it is a real darkness that both inhabits and controls space.


This, most unfortunately, is the darkness that surrounds James Dophner.  James sits - floats, rather - on a raft in the middle of the ocean.  Now, James' story is not one of heroism or adventure.  He did not survive a plane crash; he did not dive in after his true love; he truly did not venture into the ocean with any sort of courage or valor.  James, the dear boy, simply needed to use the restroom.  


In order to celebrate their recent graduation, James and some fellow classmates took a boat out off the coast of North Carolina.  Hours passed, and having the natural urge to urinate, James grabbed an inner tube and hopped off the boat to do his business.  Perhaps due to the slightly large amount of alcohol, James' peers did not realize his poorly timed bathroom break, and decided it was time to head back to shore.  In retrospect it was certainly a comical scene; James floating there with that post-urination relieved look on his face, suddenly broken as he hears the engine roar behind his back.  What followed was a comical combination of thrashing, screaming, and - not one, but two - flips off the side of the tube.  Alas, among the thundering engine and the senseless joy aboard the boat, James' cries were useless.


As day commonly does, it soon passed into night, which leaves James' in this all-encompassing darkness.  He lays back now, weighed down with the exhaustion from screaming for some sort of rescue.  It was very much a fruitless act, but how can you blame him - what other sane response is there when stranded at sea?  In times of such hopelessness there is little room left in the brain for logical thinking.  Your mind is consumed - and our dear James can clearly attest to this - with one thing: rescue.  Of course, what else is there?  I surely doubt you would suggest for James to swim back to shore, or even less become some sort of floating nomad.  No - rescue is the only positive outcome that James can hope for.  So he screamed.


Now, as he drifts in this darkness, James' mind migrates from a consuming desire to be rescued to a defeated hopelessness.  No one would find him in the night, not in a darkness so thick that he struggled to breathe.  By the morning he could have drifted any number of miles - ideally closer to shore, but seldom do these things turn out so well.  Fully convinced of his depravity, James set his mind on the fact that by next light his rescue would be impossible.  As this final realization sunk in for James, his mind raced again, for the fear of dying was much stronger than any exhaustion.


You'll find that when death becomes inevitable, the fear of actually being dead is relatively minor.  There's only so many possible outcomes - perhaps there is a Heaven that James can look forward to; perhaps everything just goes blank, and his consciousness ceases to exist; or perhaps, even, he would become a ghost and could haunt those damn ""friends"" who left him at sea.  No matter the outcome that is death, it could not be as terrible as the worst parts of life.  I mean, you can't get stranded at sea when you're dead, right?


In fact, the real fear for James is how he and this fateful Grim would be introduced.  On this front, there were nearly infinite options, each more horrifying than the last.  The most obvious in James' situation, of course, being drowning.  How awful that would be - the overwhelming panic as you realize your life depends on another breath; the desperate gasp for air only being met with water; and the final moments when - goodness, that sounds awful.  Certainly there is a better way for James to go.  But what?  Starvation?  Spending long days slowly getting weaker and weaker until the breaks in hallucinations is your only grip on reality?  No, not that.  What about a shark - it would be quick and probably without warning; but no, the pain would be overwhelming - that wouldn't work either.


You see, the fear of dying ceaselessly plagues the mind.  The best of us are offered a peaceful death, surrounded by family in a comfortable bed.  We're offered the chance at some meaningful parting words, and a calm final breath.  Outside of that, there is no enjoyable dying process - every thinkable option is too painful, or gruesome, or gross to even consider.  This, James found, was infinitely more exhausting than anything he had ever done in his life.  Being constantly terrorized by a new opportunity to die, ironically, drained every bit of life that he had left.  


This is where James made his ultimate revelation on dieing.  Dieing, in his case, is difficult no matter which way it comes.  The real terror, though, comes from the lack of control.  Truly, drowning may not be so bad if he could make the decision to make that final fleeting gasp.  Starvation may not even be terrible if he could convince himself that the stomach pains will eventually subside.  The true fear of dying is not knowing - it's not knowing when, or how, or if it's going to happen.  Death is the only thing that no man has control over - we can choose to live closer or farther from death, but ultimately the time and method is not for us to decide.


James final resolution was to not give death this satisfaction.  He would not lie down and let death decide his end.  He would not live these last hours of his life in terror of death's creative process.  He would control this; he would decide his fate.  With that, he decided that on first light he would dive down as deep as he could bear, welcome in that panicked gasp, and accept death as his inevitable end.  Overcome with the peace of knowing that he had control, James' finally drifted off to sleep.


He awoke to a familiar sound.  Yes, there were the now familiar sounds of the rolling ocean, the sound of his body squeaking against the wet inner tube, but it was neither of those.  It was faint, but pierced the calm air well enough that it could not be mistaken.  It was a boat; in fact, as it drew closer James realized that it was the very same boat that his friends had been captaining the previous day; they had come back.  With great relief, James reclaimed his wits and began another bout of screaming and thrashing to get the boat's attention.  Overcome with joy, James saw the boat turn towards him and confirm his rescue. As he was pulled aboard the boat James was quickly covered with towels to wipe away all that had come with his night at sea.  He ran the towel down his arms and legs, and felt with relief that he was wiping away the last remnants of the darkness that had clung to him the previous evening.


We see now that darkness is much more than just a space without light.  It is clearly more; darkness is a consuming force, an infection that spreads and controls everything within it.  The fear of darkness is not an irrational fear of things that might lurk in the shadows.  No, it is certainly much more.  The fear of darkness is the fear of the things it consumes; a fear of the way it surrounds, morphs, and transforms the things we know, turning them into demons that haunt us through the night.  Our only anchor is faith that darkness will pass, and its plague on our perceptions will as well.  We rely on the assurance that when night passes, light will come to reveal that darkness only provided a skewed version of our hopeful reality.

NSFW,orgymagnet,6,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iy34z/my_adventure_into_female_erotica_just_for_fun_nsfw/,"I could hear the gravel crunch under the tires of the no-name jeep as I pulled up to the farmhouse that would be my escape from the world for three days. 
Joseph, a friend from my college days, would play my host for those days at his farm in the mountains of Colorado, amid the beautiful views of rolling forests and rising mountains. It was he that stepped up and opened the door for me as I came to a stop in front of the one-story little house.
“Ma’am, I do believe you must be Miss Mary Freed, am I right?” He said, in a slight country twang.
“Oh Joseph, stop it! You know it’s me,” I said, grateful to see him once again after so many years. “Thank you so much for letting me come here and get a break from all that.” I waved at the horizon.
“No problem, just glad to help! Honestly, with the Misses’ been away for work so much, it’s been getting pretty boring up here. A change in company should do fine for me, and who better then you?”
 I laughed, “So your wife won’t mind me being here? I mean, I don’t want her to worry that we’re up to no good or anything!” 
“Nah,” Joseph said, “She won’t mind. Heck, she probably won’t even know you were ever here! Anyways, you must be mighty hungry, you look much too thin!”
We headed into his house, and into a charming little dining table made of a light wood. It was dark inside, until Joseph turned on the lights, revealing a comfortable-looking cream colored sofa and a fireplace against the wall.
“Oh, were you expecting someone else too?” I asked, noticing the three plates set on the table.
“Yeah, since the Misses’ has been away so much lately, I’ve been letting a friend stay and help out in the fields. He should be here any minute…” As if on cue, the door crashed open and in came stumbling a tall and muscular man of around twenty-nine or so. 
“Hey, Joseph, you about-“ He stopped talking when he saw me, gave me a quick up-and-down glance, and continued: “You about ready to eat? I’m starvin’!”
“In a minute. Sam, this is Miss Mary Freed. Mary, this is my dear friend Samuel Greens.”
“Nice to meet you,” I said, giving him a small courtesy. 
We all sat down to eat a delicious meal of cooked chicken and a salad of lettuce and slices of squash, drizzled with olive oil. 
“So what brings you to Crevenly Falls, Mary?” Sam asked over the food.
“Not much,” I said. “Just need to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, so I gave a call to Joseph and now I’m here!”

“Oh, the city!” Sam replied. “Too much happens out there, I’m more of a country-man myself. Nothing like raising the food you eat yourself, is there, Joseph?”
“Nope, can’t say there is much better than that,” Joseph replied.
“It really is beautiful out here, all the old trees and rivers and it’s so peaceful. There are no cars or subways to watch out for out here. If I could do it again, I would just live out here!” I said.
We finished our meals in silence for the most part, savoring the chicken. After we cleared our plates and Joseph washed them, we all agreed that it was getting late, and that it was best I go to sleep after my long trip. 
My bed was down a short hall right off the dining room. It featured a rather comfy looking bed and an absolutely gorgeous view of the mountains and the sunset. I soon slipped into my bra and panties and into the bed. Before I could get too comfortable though, the door knocked.
“Who is it?” I yelled.
“It’s me,” Said a voice that unmistakably belonged to Sam. A light yet somehow husky voice that was completely unique. 
“The door’s unlocked,” Said I, not wanting to get up and out of the covers. He came in, and seeing me under the covers, backed back out. “It’s ok,” I said, “I’m covered. What’s up?”
“Uh, me and Joseph, we were thinking that… umm, we’re going down to the ahh… the creek,” he finally bursts out, clearly nervous about me being all but nude under the blankets. “And we were wondering if you wanted to come with us tomorrow?”
“Sure,” I said, amused at his embarrassment. 
“Umm, Mary, I also wanted to ask you something else…”
“What do you want, Sam?”
“Uh, I was wondering if you had someone else back home…?”
“If you’re asking me if I have a boyfriend, the answer is no,” I said. “Not that I’m against the idea.” I gave him an overly-suggestive wink, and turned around, making it all too clear that I wanted to be alone now.

I woke to the sun blazing through the windows. Most of the day was spent eating and Joseph giving me a tour of the farm, where they grow the tomatoes and beans, where they field the cattle, etc. cetera. It was beautiful, nestled in a true no-man’s land.
When we finally left for the creek, after most of the day had already passed, I was excited. I hadn’t seen an actual creek since I was a girl, before I left for college and my life in the city. The ride there was short, just a few minutes in Josephs truck and we were plunged into the dark woods, before they opened again to reveal a narrow strip of light illuminating the fast-flowing creek. 
Unlike the creeks that I knew growing up, this one was clear as day and I could see small fish swimming near the banks.
“Oh, it’s lovely!” I exclaimed, dipping a toe in the water and scaring some fish away. “And warm!”
“It comes up from a hot spring,” Joseph said, “doesn’t even freeze over in the winter. Hey, Sam, we’re here.”
Sam took this opportunity the show himself, just getting back from a short hike upstream, it appeared. 
“You guys ready for a swim?,” he asked, sliding out of his shirt and pants before anyone could object, revealing not only a rather tight swimsuit, but also a very muscular body and what could only be the shadow of pubic hairs at the waistline of his suit. But before I could get a proper eye-full, he turned and sprang into the water with the grace of an awkward puppy, splashing water everywhere.
I slipped off my clothes as well, and into the rather tight 2-piece bikini belonging to Joseph’s wife. She definitely had smaller boobs then me.
“Umm, guys,” I called from behind the bushes, “I think this swimsuit is a little… small on me…”
“Don’t worry, we won’t look,” Joseph said, chuckling to himself and Sam. I came out from behind the bushes.
“Oh wow,” Sam said, seeing my not-as-covered breasts as I’d like them to be. “I mean, you look fine.” 
I got in the water, which was almost a hot tub in temperature. “This is really nice,” I said. “Do you guys come here often?”
“Not really,” Joseph replied, “Not as much as I’d like, anyways. The farm keeps me too busy, and it’s just boring coming out here on your own.”
“Don’t you ever take Molly down here?” I asked.
“Nahh,” he said, “I don’t think she even knows this place exists!”
“Oh… I see,” I said, finally getting an insight onto this place… and other things. Actually, it makes a lot of sense now, with Molly being gone so much and Sam practically living with Joseph, there has to be some kind of gay thing happening around here.
But Sam asked if I had a boyfriend, and I doubt he was angling for another guy… so he must be bi. Which is cool, I guess. And he is kind of cute, in that masculine yet boyish way. And he really does have style, the pubes-revealing swimsuit that only a gay man can pull of points to that.
After several hours in the creek, which involved some rather bold moves on my part involving several “accidental” crotch-grabs on Sam, we left back for the farm, skipping dinner and rather went straight to bed. 
That is, Joseph and Sam went to separate beds, I went to my room and waited for a couple minutes, before heading back out towards Sam’s room. After knocking and not hearing a reply, I opened the door.
And caught him masturbating.
Like, with the cliché lotion and tissues kind, hand on dick, gliding from head to base. When he saw me, he threw everything away and quickly shoved his dick back in his pants.
“Oh god,” he exclaimed, “it’s not… it’s not what it looks like!”
“Jesus, you look scared to death,” I said, “You don’t have to be so embarrassed though, everyone jerks it out every now and then.” 
“N-no. I was just… I have dry skin and I need to keep it from cracking…”
“Oh, you must be pretty rigorous in your lotion application then,” I said with a dramatic wink and smirk. “But seriously, you don’t need to do that… I can help you out.”
“I can’t,” he stammered out. “There’s someone else…”
“Joseph, right? Look, I know you’re bi, and I’m cool with that. And Joseph isn’t here anyways…”
“I don’t know, it isn’t right…”
“Oh shut up and take off your pants.”
Instead of him taking them off, I did, revealing black and green briefs foreshadowing quite a large package indeed. But I didn’t have time to observe the outline, for the briefs stayed on for less time than the pants did. It was then that I saw it all. A good 8 inches of flesh, rock hard and ending in a bush of reddish-blonde pubes that curled flowingly crack.
I stroked his cock, still glazed with a thin layer of lotion for a while, pumping him into ecstasy before backing off and playing with his balls for a bit. It wasn’t long before I was sucking him off though, feeling his head and shaft slide down my throat and hearing him moan, the taste of lotion still lingering on his veiny man-root. His moans increased and he started to gyrate at the wastes in a climax before I took my mouth off his dick, teasing him one last time before sucking him off to the finish, his salty-sweet load of semen ejaculated into my mouth.
“Oh god… that was amazing,” he said
“Heh, we’re not done yet,” I said, before taking off my pants and guiding his head down to my shaven pussy. My body tensed up in pleasure when I felt his tongue and fingers pulsating against my clitoris, making me produce more moistness then I care to mention, making a dark patch on his sheets. 
And then he switched it up, pulling out his once-again stiff cock and inserting it into my pussy, gyrating in and out, every movement an overwhelming surge of ecstasy until his thrusts increased in tempo and I came all over the bed and gasped for air. 
“Now that,” I said, “really was amazing.”
“Yeah, it really was.”
And then the door opened, and there stood Joseph, looking less angry and more surprised that I was in bed with his partner.

James nodded his head quietly and examined the contents of the container as they moved through the x-ray machine. “Official business?” “Of course” I replied abruptly, as he handed me back my belongings, as he put it. “Thanks James, stay safe”. “I will, see you around Nathan”.

Working for the central intelligence agency is a lot easier than what most directors and writers would have you believe. Or maybe just my job is. Most of the CIA’s work now, is just intelligence gathering, basically glorified police work, but every now and again a plan has to be drawn up, a trigger has to be pulled, and a person must die. The man who makes this sequence happen, is me.

“Ah Nathan, take a seat please.” “Sir”. “We’ve just been going over the last few details of the plan before we give the go ahead”. I took my seat at the end of the table in full view of the projector, the venetian blinds were drawn which cascaded ugly shadows on the other five members of the team.

Ericsson, the head of the department was tall intelligent man who has the respect of the entire department, he began to speak. “As you know gentlemen, Yokcasvich is already on his way to finalise a deal with the Italian mob”.   Yokcasvich!  I almost bang my fist at the name. Yokcasvich or the General, is a war criminal turned salesman. He used to be a high ranking Russian General until his war crimes were discovered during the Russian Middle Eastern war. Subsequently, he went underground and started his business of selling Russian military grade weapons on the black market to anyone who would buy. The man still commands respect and support from a number of Russian army personnel, which makes it easy for him to obtain his products. “The two men, Yokcasvich and the mob boss Dmitri, will be meeting in the woods roughly 50 miles north of San Francisco. There, they will make the exchange and once we get confirmation that the device is present, we will make our move. “Hmm” kill two fools with one bullet, I thought to myself.

“I still think it’s a stupid and risky idea” said Harry, the pompous git of the group, who pretends to know what he’s talking about. “I think killing foreign nationals on American soil is a terrible idea, I’m willing to bet that it’s going to be another Blackhawk down except in America.” “Do you even know why Blackhawk down happened?” said I.  “Our Government’s obsession over oil, Nathan, clearly” Harry replied. “Really, count for me please, the number of oil rigs in Somalia”. “Zero”. “Exactly, Blackhawk down did not happen because of oil, Blackhawk down happened because some PEOPLE STILL CARE!” “There is no need to shout at me Nathan!” “I agree, a punch to the face would be much more effective”.

“Nathan, restrain yourself!” Shouted Ericsson. “Harry, sit down, Nathan follow me”. I followed Ericsson out of the stuffy room and into the cool hall, not once taking my eyes off Harry. “Remind me again why he’s a part of this operation?” “Aw, he’s good with numbers, anyway that’s not important, have you got your team ready?” “Of course.” “And your equipment?” “Yes everything is set and ready.” “All right then operation Asgard is a go.

“Corporal Johnson reporting Sir” Johnson, a young man, new to the department and eager to impress. “Nathan please, no formalities here”. “It’s an honour to serve with you, sir”. “They all say that. Why?” “What, that it’s an honour to serve with you?” “No, why do they all say sir?” “The team is ready to move out on your orders. You’ll be riding in the rear jeep. All your equipment has already been loaded in”.

“Nathan”. It was Ericsson, suited up for the occasion as usual. “Nathan, you ready to go?”  Time stopped briefly, a smile grew on my face. “More ready than you’ll ever be Eric, let’s move!” There was a sudden flurry of activity as 20 men loaded themselves into 5 jeeps. The satisfying click and bang of car doors opening and closing was becoming cliché. I knew finally, that we had reached the end game, three years and six dead agents later, it was finally time to cleanse the universe of their scum.

An hour’s drive through the Californian countryside later and we had reached our destination, gold rock forest. “All teams call in”. “Red team in position”. Blue team in position”. Black team in position”. We were the sniper team, the team that would finish Yokcasvich and his business. My weapon of choice was the A-10 semi-automatic sniper rifle. Brand new and tailored to my dimension exactly, I liked the way it balanced in my hand, the shoulder stock gently pressed against my shoulder and hand grip moulded to accommodate my hand only. The trees swayed gently in the cool summer breeze, I could hear the distant growl of an expensive car and the dust settled in front of our position. I was in the sniper state of mind, incredibly calm and focused before every shot, and that’s when I felt it, the cold hard steel of a gun barrel pressed against my neck, an unforgettable feeling.

I knew before I even turned around to look at my killer “Harry”. “I’m afraid I can’t let you take that shot Nathan”. I looked over to Johnson, blood streamed down his forehead. “What did you do to Johnson!” “Oh, he had a meeting with a rock”. Dmitri and his men had arrived and were speaking to Yokcasvich, so I knew I had to act fast.

“Yokcasvich, it is so good to finally meet you in person” “Likewise comrade, I trust you brought the… shall we say funds?” Haha, of course, Yokcas and you the device?” “Right here”.

“Nathan, Nathan, the device is present, make the shot.” “Nathan take the shot!” My ear piece screamed at me, but no time to concentrate, Harry was faster and stronger than I had imagined… and… he.

“Wait boss, do you hear that?” “What, no quiet, sorry Yokcas how much?” “500,000 euro, the dollar is not, how you say, as appealing as it used to be”. And you can assure me that it is military grade?” “I stake my reputation on it Dmitri”.

I… Slammed him against the jeep… and… pain… then… hit him across the face with my elbow… wait… how… punched him in the face… pushed me… on the ground… deafening sound… and then, it was all over. It took me a second to realise why he wasn’t shooting me, but then I saw that most of his face was missing, Johnson had come to and shot Harry with the rifle. Harry slumped to the ground lifeless.

A shot rang out “What was that? Is this a set up?!” “I don’t know but I’m not waiting around to find out”. “Wait Yokcas, the device, give me the device!” In the confusion, Dmitri pushed his way through his men as they jostled for a seat in the car. “Yokcas!” Dmitri marched up to Yokcasvich, grabbed his shoulder, turned him around and produced a glock. “Give me the device!” The time for games was over.

“Johnson, thank you”. “Here quickly, they know we are here”. Johnson threw me the rifle and I dived to my shooting position. Dmitri had made his way to the front of the crowd and up to Yokcasvich. Was that a gun he was holding? Doesn’t matter, now was the time, I focused my lens, took a breath and pulled the trigger which ignited the firing cap, accelerating a 44gram copper and lead slug past the sound barrier and over 500 feet of rocky forest terrain and in between the shoulder blades of Dmitri.  The lifeless lump of metal wasn’t finished yet, it carried on into the forehead of Yokcasvich. The two men slumped against the car and slid down until they met the dusty forest floor.

I lowered my rifle and let a tree take my weight, I didn’t do much but I was still visibly exhausted. Everything seemed so calm now as we watched the chaos in the valley below. “Good shot… Nathan”. “Haha, you’re not so bad yourself, John”. I waited there with Johnson as he was treated for his wound. Then, we continued to talk up there on the ridge, about the CIA, about Ireland my home country, until the sun went down, when we finally decided to get some rest so that we could fight another day.

 Once I traveled to the Great Summit in order that I may consult the Wise Man of the Mountain. The journey was long and treacherous, but, I knew His thoughts would be  well worth the hardships. When I arrived, a man of great age stood in front of me, his face pounded with knowledge, for he was truly ancient and wise. We exchanged cordial greetings and for a short time, I sat and only watched him in awe of His vastness. Soon we began to talk and converse, and as we exchanged ideas and thoughts, I learned a great many things; Truths that would boggle even the most vivid imagination, answers to questions that have not yet been asked and answers to ancient unsolved problems. As we continued, I realized that He had wisdom and knowledge that one would expect only a God could have. We sat for days on end. Morning turned to evening, evening to night and night to morning. Six days of learning, sharing and relating ideas with the Wise Man passed by. But on the sixth night our conversation turned to what was to be our final topic; religion and religious beliefs. He continued to bat the wisdom of ages at me, and I continued to learn and analyze what He told me. Morning was quickly upon us, and I knew that my time was done. I must leave now or stay forever for the Man of Wisdom lived by a strict law. I rose and began to bid him farewell when He smiled at me and stated what I knew He had been thinking since I arrived. He looked at me with an air of confidence and a twinkle in his eye as though He knew exactly how I would reply. He shook His head and, ""Yes, you do believe in God."" To this I shook my head and calmly pronounced, ""No, not as has been taught to us over the ages."" This seemed to startle the Wise Man and with a puzzled look he replied, ""You have stated that all men must believe in something to exist at peace with themselves. This is true, and by the manner with which you present yourself to me, I know that you are at peace with yourself. Yet you don't believe in God as he has been taught to you through the ages? Tell me then, young man, what do you believe in?"" To his puzzled response, I simply answered, ""Old Man, you are truly wise, but n all of your wisdom, you have lost the simple meaning of life. I, dear sir, believe in MAN."" The Wise Man was taken back, for he thought He knew all that was knowable, and I have given him a strange answer. His face grimaced with confusion, but, within seconds His years if experience and His knowledge of the past seemed to take over, and once again He began to think, search, reach into Himself for the answer, as He had done in the years gone by. Suddenly, He found what he was looking for. In a deep, dark corner hidden from view He found the answer. His face calmed and a smile came across his lips and He said, ""Young man, you are truly the Wise Man for you are right!"" We gave an exchange of knowing glances and He nodded to me as I left the summit. I heard Him say ever so softly, ""Believe in Man"". I have never seen the Wise Man since then, but I still feel His presence guarding me, and He, mine guarding him.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1iu6jo,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iu6jo/new_post_journey_to_the_summit/,
1374499123.0,2,self.shortstories,1it658,How 'Bout Last Night: A Tale of Drunken Despondency,CandyMan77,2,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1it658/how_bout_last_night_a_tale_of_drunken_despondency/,"I picked out a whiskey I had never seen before from the shelf at the liquor store. It promised a bevy of flavours I didn’t care for, but it was obscure enough to impress and cheap enough to afford. I brought it to the front and cashed out, after being glared at incredulously by the cashier for some time. My license picture was remarkably unfortunate.

I returned with my prize to a friend’s barren apartment. The previous tenants had systematically extirpated the meager quarters, leaving cracked windows, a broken faucet and sagging door frames. No furniture had been moved in, and the electricity had yet to be engaged. 

We began to drink. I wondered politely if there might be a mixer or a chase. He called me a pussy. I cracked the 26 oz bottle and suckled at it, proclaiming to him about the intricacies of this craft whiskey, and how lucky I was to have found it at such a shitty liquor store. It tasted like gasoline.

It was her birthday tonight. I had driven almost two hours to sleep on the floor in a shit hole just to see her and go to her party. I didn’t know anyone there, except my buddy who was also going. We all went to highschool together. It was only 5, but she had texted me asking me to come earlier. I needed a good buzz before that.

I sucked at the bottle, my throat burning. God that’s the good shit I said. My buddy grabbed the bottle and took a swig. He shuddered slightly and told me how good it was. What time did we want to go? Soon I said. Soon? It was only 5. Well she wanted us there early. Yeah but not that early. I called him a fucking retard.

We proceeded out of the dilapidated apartment. My belly was warm and the air was warm, and sweat pooled in my armpits and groin. We called a cab, and waited on the corner of a street for it to come. We got in. It smelled of curry and moist asshole. My buddy sat in the front seat and I leaned in the back fingering my necked whiskey. After a few minutes the cab arrived at her house, and I reached into my back pocket for a damp bill which I passed forward. I exited the fusty vehicle, clutching my 2-6 and rang the doorbell before my buddy had even closed his door.

She answered, surprised. We were there too early. I said we wanted to help set up. She told me we were sweet. It was a worthy prevarication. 

I went in the house and introduced myself to her roommates. They were pretty, talkative, and vapid. She went among them, the alpha. Literally taller. In the better program, from the better family. Beautiful. I took a powerful slug of whiskey, and smiled and laughed. I lifted and organized and joked with my buddy and drank more. As I was lifting the keg into an ice-filled tub, she came up behind me and touched my arm. Thanking me. I told her it was my pleasure and concealed my erection.

More friends of hers showed up. The girls went into a room and changed into shorter skirts. The men shook hands firmly and discussed drinking and other important things. I pulled away at my whiskey, receiving fervent compliments for my fortitude with hard liquor. I went on at length about its quality. The liquid pooled hotly in my gut, like blood.

The girls came out of their room shortly before a horde of guests arrived. The keg was tapped and the party began in earnest. She hurried between guests, a red cup in her hands. She drank and laughed and talked. I looked at her and she smiled at me. I felt hot and flushed. Another swig and I’d go talk to her.

But my buddy summoned me to a cramped room. Large men sweating and shouting. Cups askew on the table top. We played a game. I threw the ball disinterestedly across the table missing often. My buddy screamed obscenities and gesticulated wildly. We both drank frequently and lost the game. 

I had to sit down for a minute. She was smoking pot in the next room. I could hear her laughter. Had to collect my shit.
One of the players from the cramped room came out. He handed me a bottle of whiskey barbeque sauce and suggested I use it to chase. I dissented. My buddy came out. Don’t be a fucking pussy. Alright. I tilted the nearly empty bottle to my mouth and pulled long. I clutched for the sauce and tipped that to my mouth. People laughed. It tasted better with the sauce.

There she was. Coming at me. Man up. Hey how are you feeling. Real good. You’re really fucked eh. Nah I do this all the time. Drink some water. Okay.

I put my face under the kitchen sink faucet and turned it on. Water ran into my mouth, over my face. I walked back to her, water dribbling down my chin, my shirt wet. Maybe you should go sit down. Alright.

The whiskey barely covered the bottle bottom. I went to take off the cap but it was gone. Fuck it. I killed the bottle and dropped it to the floor. Watch it man. Fuck off dude.

I wandered out the front door. My buddy came up. You gonna puke man? Nah. I do this all the time. He went back inside and I puked all over her porch.

Staggering against the side wall I pulled myself towards her small backyard. I lay down, shivering and vomiting. I felt for the phone in my pocket, and brought it to my face, the tinny blue light illuminating the patch of ill-kempt lawn around me. Fumbling with the microscopic buttons I typed out I’m sorry. I puked three more times before I sent it to her.

Eventually my buddy collected me. You need to go to the hospital dude? Yeah. Well I’m just gonna take you home OK? Alright.
He handed me a bag for the cab. No puking in the cab. I pressed my face against the cool glass, and shut my eyes.

When we arrived at his place I couldn’t climb the stairs. He lifted and pushed me most of the way. We got inside and I went to the washroom and I puked on the floor.

He went to his room; I could hear him talking on the phone. Couldn’t hear what it was but it was about me. I lay on the cool floor, trying not to smell my own vomit. I took out my phone and there was a message from her. It’s fine, thanks for coming.

There was a smiley face.

It was a live performance given by a clone who shared his memories, and genuinely believed that he was the man that the roaring audience believed him to be. The tone and intonation, the cadence and every pause were flawlessly like he himself would have given the speech.

The clone had limited autonomous functions, but was usually controlled by a neural interface worn by the “real” President. The same was true for the first lady and their young children. They would exist in a form of stasis, thinking and feeling everything that their avatars felt while controlling their actions. The amount of lag between thought and action was almost infinitesimal. In any event, each consciousness was merged with its counterpart every few nanoseconds. Soon, there would be no real difference between the man on the monitor and the semi-conscious man in the casket. They would even age at the same rate, right down to the graying of their hair.

After two consecutive Presidents had been killed, after wars had brought the human species to the brink of extinction no matter how much outside intervention and advice was given, it was decided that the cloning scheme was the best way to continue the tradition of American democracy. It was much the same in Russia, China and every other country on earth. World leaders interfaced with computers that were exponentially faster than anything the consumer or military sectors had ever seen. Interfaced and negotiated terms at speeds which were exponentially faster than the speed of light. These speeds allowed for fewer misunderstandings. Anxiety and paranoia were lowered considerably. Knowing that aliens were monitoring all communications and could intercede at any moment convinced even the most eccentric of leaders to behave themselves.

“Are you sure this is the only way?” He asked the grey alien as he was laid into a casket like device with an opaque lid that would soon be closed over him. “Yes,” the grey biped replied with only a touch of asperity. The President-elect felt the reply in his mind. The only sound he heard was the throbbing of the alien machinery all all around him. ""This system has saved earth from destruction many times. I admit, that there are certain, sacrifices..."" he said gesturing his arm around the enormous cavern which was filled with similar casket-like devices containing political and religious figures from around the globe. Some had slumbered here half alive and half dead for decades. 

He began to have second thoughts as the lid started to close, sealing him in, but something in one of the tubes now connected to his body was secreting a compound that calmed him and took away his fears. It also gave him a new clarity and perspective; of course this was the only way. He received greetings and congratulations simultaneously from the networked leaders of the world as well as from the leaders of races he had never imagined existed.

The lid was closing now. “ See you in four years, mister President,” the voice of the gray creature said speaking directly into his mind, “Or ,if you are fortunate, eight”

It was the dead of winter on the hollowed grounds of the Turner family’s vacation estate in northern Colorado. All was calm and quiet across the endless array of rolling hills, which so plainly swept through the ancient valley. 
Mr. and Mrs. Turner were in a hurry, as they rushed to slide their coats on. Maurine Daniels, a seventeen-year-old New Yorker, new to Colorado helped them out the door. 
“Alrite Maurine, emergency contacts on the fridge, there’s some games and food in the kitchen, no sweets for either of them, and off to bed at nine thirty, no exceptions.” “You two just have fun, we’ll be fine here.” Mrs. Turner chimed in; honestly Roger, trust the girl”, she said with a chuckle. “Maurine dear, if there’s anything at all you need don’t hesitate to give us a ring. Mr. Turners been a bit grouchy. Tonight the American Psychiatric Association is recognizing him for his contributions to the field.  “I swear, it’s year after year with these people.”  “Oh come on you old grouch. Bye kids!”
 The Turners dashed out the door. The skies opened up as heavy rain began to plummet down. Maurine shut the door as she heard the revving of an engine. The lights flashed on as the car zipped down the driveway. 
	A few hours passed as Cindy and John played board game after board game with their baby sitter who forced a smile and pictured money. The clock struck nine thirty as Maurine lit up with anticipation. “Okay kids. Time for bed.” “Ten more minutes?” “John your father said no exceptions.” The children ran upstairs and hurried off to bed. 
	Maurine dropped to the couch as if she had been shot. She rolled over, got up and turned on the television. “Thank God these kids don’t argue that much”, she thought to herself.  Suddenly the phone rang. 
	Maurine walked over to pick it up. “Hello?” She could hear nothing more than a slight crinkling sound. “Hello?” After hanging up the phone she fell fast asleep. A few minutes later Cindy came downstairs. 
	“What are you doing up?” asked Maurine playfully with a yawn. “I can’t sleep.” “Why, what’s wrong?” “The statue in my room is scary.” “Come on, we’ll take care of it. Let’s go see.” The two walked up the endless staircase to Cindy and John’s room. 
	Maurine paced the vast room. She saw three statues. There was a knight, a clown, and a half-sized sculpture of a horse. She covered all three admittedly frightening figures. “All better. Now off to bed you”, said Maurine with a warm smile. Cindy smiled back and hopped into bed. “Good night.”
	Maurine went back downstairs and the phone rang as soon as she hit the couch. She rushed to the phone this time. “Hello?” “Maurine dear, its Mrs. Turner. I just wanted to check in. How are the kids?” “They’ve been perfect angels. I just put Cindy back to bed.” “Oh is she making a fuss?” “No she couldn’t sleep because of the clown statue in her room.” There was a long pause. 
“Darling, there’s no clown statue.” “The one across from her bed?” Mrs. Turner went hysterical on the other end of the phone. 
“Get the children out of the house! I’ll phone the police!” Mrs. Turner hung up. 
	Maurine was confused. She walked up the stairs and slowly began to realize the horrific reality of her situation. At the same time, it hit her all at once. She panicked and exploded up the stairs, anxiously swung the door open, saw two of three statues, and the kids were gone. “Shit!” 
There was an open window, which so calmly introduced the howling of winds that blew the white curtains of the children’s bedroom. They looked like ghosts dancing, taunting her.
 	She sprinted to the opening and gazed out into the endless flash of white that appeared to be the beginnings of a blizzard. Maurine hopped out the window onto the massive ledge, which canopied over the second floor porch on the massive three-story estate. She looked around, there was nothing in sight, and nowhere they could have gone.
 As she gazed into the far distance, she could make out what seemed to be a colossal barn. “Its too far away”, she thought to herself in a panicky disposition. She noticed a tiny window on the great wooden barn. It illuminated the pitch white of the furious storm. 
Maurine’s eyes entranced, a chill ran down her spine, not from the five-degree monster that gave her frostbite, but from the nightmare that was her reality. 
She rushed across the glowing white desert and bombarded the monstrous wooden door to find both Cindy and John asleep on the ground. Maurine rushed over and picked them up. She cried at the thought of her certainty that there was a clown lurking somewhere in the barn.
 She realized her intuition to be fact when the door slammed shut before she could set foot to freedom. 
The clown “statue” glared at her and slowly paced her way, plank-by-plank, creak-by-creak. 
She could feel herself stepping backward. “Who are you? Why are you doing this?” The clown, who stood in a narrow doorway, began to cackle wildly. He had a crackly thunderous voice. The kind of voice one gets from smoking three packs a day for over thirty years.
 “Why don’t you know my name?” “Oh my God, who are you?” she begged. “Oh I’m just -.” 
Out of nowhere, the clown had a face of shock, he froze as his eyes widened and his expression went stoic. He fell to the ground. Maurine looked at the children and slowly made her way to the clown. There was a huge stab wound in his back. The monster laid face first in a pool of its own blood. 
Maurine ran back to see who had saved her. “Oh thank . . . you.” Maurine stood there disappointed, her rescuer was nowhere in sight. She took the kids back to the house. Twenty minutes passed, and another hour before the Turners arrived. “Mommy, daddy!” yelled the children as they leapt into their parent’s arms. Mrs. Turner was in tears; “I’m just glad you’re all unharmed.” Mr. Turner walked up to a detective. “Who was this man and what did he want with my children?”
 The detective looked around and pulled Mr. Turner aside. He slowly leaned in and whispered; “He wasn’t after you or you’re kids. He knew Maurine would be here tonight. His name’s Douglas Daniels, no relation. He followed her from New York. He’s an old neighbor.” 
“Who killed him?” “We aren’t sure.” Maurine was grateful to be alive. A detective came downstairs. “Ms. Daniels, you said there were three statues.” “There were.” “We only found a small horse statue.” “No there was that, the clown, and a . . . there was a knight.” 
Another detective came down; “we found a sword with blood on the ridge.” Maurine felt that same chill she had when the window lit up, only this time a smile crossed her face.

I see in the vast snowfields ahead of me, a looming presence.
One of a morbid curiosity, one that wishes to ensnare me in the deep valleys and trap me atop the vast mountains.
I can't tell if this presence is sentient, if it is even real. 
I look to the village at my back, a burned shadow. The wood-framed huts are charred, the ashes of civilization set to fertilize the dead souls that they bear.
The North, spoken in the villages adorning the Edge, was originally far away, a mere speck on the maps of the world.
I look down at my fur boots and see the evidence that the rumors are true; the frost slowly grows over a blade of glass until the weight pulls that blade down into submission.
The presence is one of morbid curiosity, for it wishes to cover everything in it's embrace. As I step onto the ice, I know I am next.

--------------------

THE FIREMAN

Officially, the end of the world does not exist. Officially, where I am standing experiences mild winters and brisk summers annually, and is a thriving production center for the logging industry. Officially, I am designated as the chief fireman of this official hamlet.
The men who hired me, many kilometers south of this official place, asked of me to officially guard the surrounding band of land, stretching 100 kilometers across.

That was ten days ago. I arrived yesterday to perform my job, which officially is to patrol and protect this 100 kilometer band of land, interspersed with slight hamlets and towns, from fires.

My real job is to use my talents to burn everything in this frozen hellhole to the ground.
Because, just north of where I am standing, is a huge glacier, stretching thousands of kilometers across, and growing. It's heading south at speeds that would allow it to reach the capital in two years.

They've tried catapults filled with flaming boulders. They've pleaded with the gods. They've even embezzled enough money from the Royal Treasury to send all of them to the gallows,.
The fat king doesn't know, the Archbishop is clueless, and the aristocrats that hired me are too scared to think straight; so they hired me.

They know my price to end this glacier. They know that for every person I burn down, the glacier will be slowed, just slightly.
They think that the people I've been sent to slaughter will slow the beast down enough for them to rest easy.
I look at the remains of the official hamlet surrounding me, the embers floating in the slight wind. I look at my hands made of pure fire, slightly worried at how they shake at the sight of the glacier and it's frozen embrace.

But, I have accepted my fate, and I will enjoy the mad and fiery descent into it.

I don't know why, but I had the urge to write about situations of apocalyptic and encroaching cold. I guess the two stories could fit in a single 'world', what with the narrator in SATNG looking at the ruins of a village burned by the Fireman.

""Mornin, Bev,"" rasped from his throat, all full-flavored reds and bubble gum. ""Lookin' nice today. As usual."" He shrugged off the last bit, sinking into his chair. It was a single booth in the center of the diner. The walls were covered in pictures of regular customers, all the booths and bar stools were chrome and baby blue, and the fans turned in slow creaks. It was an old place where you could feel grease in the air as soon as you walked in. 


The waitress looked over and smiled. In her 2 years working at Mel's, the man in the black suit had been there every Tuesday morning. ""Oh hi ya Charlie!"" she beamed, pouring a cup of coffee. She handed it to him black. ""How's the hand?""


""Steel, baby, steel."" She laughed with her head back, patting him on the shoulder. 


""Well ain't that somethin', haha, we'll be right back with your eggs, Charlie."" She scurried off behind the bar still smiling. Charlie grinned too, taking off his sunglasses. He popped open his newspaper and dove in. 


The bell above the door rang out twice as another black-suited man walked in, hair long and greasy. He sniffled some, looking around. He saw Charlie sitting, looking at the Sports section and walked over, his shoes sticking to the ground as he did so.


""Hiya, Charlie,"" spilled the mess in a suit, gnawing on a toothpick.  


""Hiya, Cheeks,"" he replied. ""What can I do ya for?""


""You know, the funniest thing happened to me today, Charlie. I think you ought to hear about it."" Cheeks talked with his hands. 


""I bet you'll tell me even if I shoot my damn ears off."" He didn't yet take his eyes from his paper. The jukebox played Pinball Wizard faintly. 


""You're god damn right, Charlie, god damn right. So I'm pulled over, bout 5 am. Pulled over, side of the road, I'm cleaning my gun. Yeah, I'm cleaning my gun on the side of the road, 'cause when I do it home the broad starts going off in fits, real woman shit, you know. Anyway so I'm cleaning my gun and I hear this sound, this, this fucking hiss in my ears you know? And so I look around the corner and I see this little kid, this little fucking kid, and he's tagging the wall.""	


At this, Cheeks looked genuinely offended. He raised his hands in as shrug to get a response. Charlie dropped his newspaper. Cheeks always demanded your full attention, and somehow or another he always managed to get it. 
	

""You're a god damn criminal, for Christ's sake. Who the fuck cares if he's tagging a wall?"" 


Cheeks rolled his eyes and reared his head while continuing: ""Yeah, I am, alright? Yeah I am a fucking criminal. And at the time, I care. I walk up to this kid and I'm like 'Hey!' you know, like 'Hey! What the fuck do you think you're doing, huh?' And this kid, he drops his can of paint and he's just looking at me and I see it, you know, I see he's afraid of me. I mean, he's just staring, not moving or nothin'. He's shitting his pants, and at first I think it's the suit that's turning him white, but that ain't it. I realize I still got my gun in my hand. I didn't mean to, I swear I didn't mean to, but I was waving it around in his face like we're at work or some shit. Ain't got no clip in it or nothing, but still, he don't know that. So he's shitting his pants thinking some crazy well-dressed low life is about to blow his fucking brains out for defacing public property, so I just go with it. I pretend I knew the fucking gun was there the whole time and I tell him to get the fuck out of here and to leave the paint.""	
	

Charlie had been looking over his shoulders, making sure none of the other few people in the diner were paying any attention. Despite his excitement, Cheeks managed to keep a low volume. Starting to get annoyed, Charlie asked, ""I don't suppose there's a point here, now is there Cheeks?""
	

Cheeks lightly smacked his chair in annoyance. ""Of course there's a point!"" He said, cocking his head and looking at Charlie as if he were stupid. ""It got me thinking. This kid, you know, of course he turns around and starts booking it. So I pop in the clip, square up and shoot him twice in the back. Didn't even deserve it, didn't even do a fucking thing. But it got me thinking.""
	

""Jesus Christ,"" said Charlie, ""I'd hope it would.""
	

""Yeah well it did. I'm gonna blow my fucking brains out.""	
	

""What in the hell are you talking about?""	
	

""Yeah, yeah no really. I'm gonna blow my fucking brains out. Now don't get sentimental with me, Charlie, I know you never liked me. That's alright, and don't pretend to care and give me some bullshit about not doing it. I got my reasons, alright? And it's gonna happen. I just wanted to fucking tell somebody so that one of you could fill in for me on the bank job.""
	

""Are you fucking kidding me?"" laughed Charlie, clearly in disbelief. ""You're gonna blow your fucking brains out and you're telling me so that I can pick up a shift?"" 
	

""Yeah, you know, I don't wanna fuck anybody else over. So fuck it. Work for me, I'll buy your fucking breakfast."" The waitress came back with Charlie's eggs. She set the plate down in front of him, with two sausages in a little saucer on the side that she snuck to him. 
	

""You're too kind, sweetheart,"" smiled Charlie through his wrinkles. 
	

""Oh, it ain't nothin' Charlie. You need anything, darlin'?"" Cheeks waved his hands and shook his head. ""Well alright, ya'll enjoy, okay?""
	

""Will do, Bev,"" replied Charlie, sticking his napkin down the front of his collar. He picked up fork and took a big bite.
	

""The fuck did you just call her?"" Cheeks sat up, looking alert. Charlie looked up, confused about his offense, and finished chewing.
	

""Bev.""
	

""That's Donna.""  
	

""No, Cheeks, that's Bev. Short for Beverly."" 
	

""I know what Bev is short for, Charlie, and I'm fucking telling you that that ain't her fucking name, okay? It's Donna.""
	

""The hell's it matter what her name is?
	

""Because it fucking matters, alright? It fucking matters that you call somebody by their fucking name. What, are we just gonna start calling Adolf Hitler fucking Susan B. Anthony? No. So it matters, you know, you gotta call somebody by their own name. None of this nickname bullshit.""
	

""Well, then, I think you'd best call the lady Bev, on account of that's her name.""
	
""I'm fucking TELLING you, Charlie, her name is Donna, and don't you call her Bev not one more god damn time, you hear me? I swear to God, Charlie, don't call her Bev again, or I'll put a fucking bullet in you. Alright?""
	

""You won't put shit in shit."" Charlie looked Cheeks dead in the eye, taking his half-joke completely seriously. 
	

""Oh yeah?"" replied Cheeks. There were a few moments where both sat in silence at the table. Eggs mostly untouched, coffee getting cold, jukebox shorting out. They were the quietest few moments since either men walked into the diner. In a flash, both had their handguns drawn from their belts, pointing them at each other under the table. The both sat stiffly upright, eyes fully open, yet somehow appeared calm, experienced. 


""You want to make a bet?"" asked Cheeks, finally. I'm right, I put a bullet in your head. You're right, you put one in mine. How's that sound?"" 


Charlie continued to stare him down. It had been a relaxing morning, and even though he thought trouble was inevitable, it had come a little earlier than expected that day. ""Do I look like a pussy to you?"" he spat. 
	

""What?""
	

""A pussy. Do I. Look like a pussy. To you?"" Cheeks looked confused. They both began to perspire. ""Only a pussy would take that bet, and only a pussy would come up with it, too. I'll give you this: you're right, and you can put a bullet in my belly, then one in my throat. Right here. And if I'm right, I'll do the same."" Cheeks licked his lips and looked around. No one had any idea what was going down. ""Well, what's it gonna be?""
	

""Fuck yeah, you son of a bitch. But I'm telling you her name is Donna.""
	

They flagged down another waitress passing by and asked her to bring over theirs. They requested that she take off her name tag. They were having a little bet, you see, and they didn't want to ruin the surprise. 
	

""Don't cry when she gets here,"" mocked Charlie. ""When Bev gets here.""
	

""Her name is Donna, Charlie.""	
	

""I'm sorry, sir, but no it's not.""
	

""Oh yeah, and what makes you so fucking sure huh? What makes you so fucking positive, so fucking sure?""
	

""A man is sure, Cheeks, a gentleman is certain.""
	

""Fuck you. Fuck you and your bullshit, alright. Her name is fucking Donna. I know this.""
	

""Now listen here,"" said Charlie, finally showing signs of anger. ""I've been coming to this diner every Tuesday morning for four years. For the past two of those four years, Bev has been my waitress. She's five-four, lives over in The Gallery on Gilbeaux, has a kid named Danny and a dog named Pepper. She sneaks me sausages and refills my coffee when it's empty. Bev does all this, all the while me addressing her by her name, to her face. Now just how in the hell do you think I've gotten by all this time if her name was Donna?""
	

Cheeks' face dropped. He seemed uncertain, nervous. If anyone was going to kill him, it had to be himself. Charlie couldn't be right, this was Donna. Her name was Donna. He was certain. 
	

The waitress got to the table still smiling. ""What can I do you for, Charlie?"" Her name tag was gone. 
	

He took a sip of his coffee, hiding his gun hand under the tablecloth still. Setting the mug down, he looked at her with longing for a second, then looked away. ""I'm sorry 'bout this, I really am, but my acquaintance and I are having a little bet.""
	

Cheeks interrupted, ""He says your name is Bev, alright? But I seen you at dollar burgers, Wednesdays at The Dog. And I says your name is Donna.""


The three of them looked back and forth at one another. A two legged Mexican standoff. The waitress didn't know what to say, so Charlie cut in.
	

""Now, this is very important here, Bev, so just tell us one time, in all honest, what your first name is.""
	

She wasn't sure if it was a joke or not, so she giggled uncomfordably for a moment. She realized neither of the two were laughing, but staring with stone faces and their hands in their laps. 
	

""It's Donna.""
	

Charlie looked a little surprised as the bullet tore through his stomach, the sound so loud that a cook nearly pissed himself. Donna bent her knees, screaming with her hands over her ears. The few other customers flew out of the door, and the cooks out the back. Within minutes, the only sounds were Donna's screaming and Charlie's slow groans. 

	
""I fucking TOLD you, Charlie! I told you that was her name! I told you it was Donna!"" Cheeks was hollering now, pacing slightly over the bleeding, suited body of his coworker. ""Hey, shut the fuck up!"" He pointed his gun at Donna, who held her hands over her mouth immediately and got down on the floor. He pointed it back at Charlie, whose breath was quick and light. They locked eyes. ""Well?""
	

""Well..."" choked Charlie, spitting up blood. He was lying on the floor now, barely propping himself up with his elbows. He looked past Cheeks, at nothing at all, lost in the shock. 
	

""Well?""
	

""Well then... who the fuck is Bev?"" Charlie managed a small laugh. Cheeks was taken back, but let out a ha or two himself. 


""Sorry, old man,"" he replied, now cold. ""but I got no clue."" He shot Charlie in the throat. The old man's body jerked and fell completely flat as Donna began to scream again. Cheeks stood her up with force, still staring at Charlie's mostly dead body.
	

""Sorry about that, maam,"" he yelled over her screams. ""Sorry! Here you go!"" He took out his wallet and tossed five one-hundred dollar bills at her. ""For all your fucking trouble!""
	

Cheeks turned away from her and laughed. The last thing he tasted was the barrel of his gun, all irony like blood. The last thing he smelled was Charlie's unpaid-for breakfast. The last things he heard were screams and a gunshot. The bullet ripped through the back of his mouth, through his head, out the top of his skull and got stuck in a ceiling tile. 
	

Donna screamed louder and ran out of the diner. Sirens wouldn't sound for minutes. While Charlie's life approached its final seconds, all that remained of his relaxing morning was the quiet. His final thought was in jest of himself.

Shiloh Conners beat me bad. I was just looking for a book. Yes, I was told that book contained the true history of the world. That book contained a lot more. It contained the true story of the downfall of the greatest leader the world had ever seen. It contained the true story about how trade was established from the fertile farmlands to the barren cities where everyone lived off what they could grow in their backyards and what animals they could cook.

Shiloh Conners didn't want anyone to read that book, and now I know why. Now I know and he has to die. There was a time when he didn't have to die. There was a time Shiloh Conners wasn't guilty. That was a long time ago. When he wasn't who he was now. When he didn't kill my wife. When he didn't beat me and leave me here. That was before I talked to a man who told me about the book.

I need a drink.

**Chapter One**  

Ian Ruhte slept peacefully on a straw mat, his wife pacing the fireplace. She couldn't sleep when he was going to leave just the next day. The next day arrived as she paced, wearing a rut into the floor in front of the embers. Ian turned over and saw his wife holding back tears, exhausted and tense.

""Doesn't make sense to kill yourself so slowly, girly. You need to stop worrying so much.""

""Don't tell me not to worry. One of these days you're not going to come back. It's a dangerous job.""

""Dangerous, yes. And it takes me away from you for long periods of time. But after this quarter I've passed the apprenticeship period and I get fellowship pay. That's the kind of money that can guarantee our lives.""

""Is a guaranteed living better than a probable death?""

""Red don't do this to me. You knew I was in training to be a field rigger. We met at a bar full of them!""

""I just don't think it's worth it when there are so many safer jobs in town.""

""Safer jobs won't make us wealthy.""

""Wealth hasn't anything to do with it when you are laid out and dead.""

""At least then you could collect some good insurance. You'd be set for quite a few years.""

Red glared at him. That was an enraging statement and always cut deep when Ian said things like that.

""That's cruel Ian. You're a cruel man.""

""No crueler than I need to be. Honesty may be cruel but it has come to me quite nicely."" He stepped closer and kissed his wife. Every kiss they shared was electric. That was what brought them together in the first place- that electricity. Ian washed his face and dressed. ""I'll send word if I'm going to be gone for more than a few days,"" he said. 

""I pray you won't be. I need you here more often."" Red sighed and wiped the weariness from her face. 

""I love you Red. Please take care."" Ian kissed her again, then went to the dresser. He grabbed his axe and hooks and strapped them on to his back. Then he grabbed a leather pouch and stuffed it in his pocket. He walked out of the door and Red sat down, breathed deeply, and fell asleep.

**Chapter Two**  

I remember the bar where I first met Red. It was called the Backwoods Game Lounge, and it was always hot. They kept it hot in there year round. The fire was constant and somehow managed to warm the whole place, while the drinks warmed me inside. It was the only place I could manage to go after rigging all day. It was physically exhausting to be an apprentice field rigger, but it made me strong. Not strong enough to kill that bastard, but strong enough to break into the Central House and find the book.

I didn't only meet Red at the bar. I met the man who changed my life. Who opened my eyes to the truth. He called himself.. what did he call himself? The Wizard. Yes, that's right. He told me about the book. The history. Well, he thought it was a history. Or maybe he just told me it was a history. He probably knew what it really was. He knew who I really was, and he knew who that bastard really was and what he'd done. He probably knew what he'd do too. I think the Wizard should have died too. I don't know. Once I find and kill Shiloh, I'll find the Wizard and find out what he really knew. Then I'll kill him. 

That book was no history. I read the chapter that I felt drawn to. It was clear that it may have been historical like a myth or something, but in reality I knew what it was. It was a prophecy. I was one of the subjects of the prophecy. Prophecy cloaked as a history. Clever, whomever wrote that. Whomever? Whoever? Not that it matters here in my mind. 

I wonder if the Wizard wrote this. He seemed like a smart man. Round face. Round glasses. Hair that curled out under his cap. He wasn't round, but every detail was. He cracked his knuckles a lot. He told me about the book and how I needed to read it. He saw me at the bar every day. He knew I liked to read. I'm a good reader. That's how I found the chapter so fast and figured out what it truly meant.

He had to have written it. He practically told me so himself. I wonder how old he really was. He didn't look more than forty. He had to be older. He begged me, pleaded with me to read the book. He knew it wasn't a history. He knew who I really was. He knew what I was going to do. 

He knew what that evil man had done.

**Chapter Three**

Ian woke with a start. His parents were arguing again. Five years young, he had a mane of wavy blonde hair. He didn't know much, but he knew when his parents argued it never ended happy. He hid himself away and listened to their yelling. His dad was always louder.

""I'm telling you Martha, they're driving the trade! He's paying off everyone and getting rid of anyone who won't take his money.""

""Well then maybe your dad should just take his money. It couldn't possibly be worse.""

""It is worse because he gets to dictate who trades what, when, and who they can trade it with. It's servitude. He has no right!""

""He's young. The youngest ruler in the Central House that we've ever seen. He'll change as he grows into it.""

""He lied and cheated his way in. Building his legacy on that foundation I don't think he's going to change. He's going to make the farmers his men with money or with violence. It's just wrong. My father and I are going to stand against him.""

""You'll die.""

""And I'll take out as many as I can with me.""

""How could you be so cruel! Ian is only five. How on earth could I provide for him?""

""You'll get my severance pay. You'll get income from the farm- my mother will see to that even if my father dies with me.""

Martha couldn't keep the tears from streaming down her face. Ian cried too, but no one could see him in his corner. He couldn't figure out what was going on. All he knew is that a few days later his dad was gone and his mom cried a lot. 

""Ian, promise me you'll never leave me"" she begged of him.

""Of course mommy. I won't leave you."" A child's promise. Pure, innocent, and sweet.

Ian took care of his mom for two more years until she died. She cried a lot. She didn't cry when she was dead. Ian thought that was better.

**Chapter Four**

I know why my dad died. I read it in the book. They thought it was a history. ""The Real History of the Central Houses"" it was called. Houses. As in more than one. I only ever knew the one. How can you have more than one center? It was in the book. There used to be two Houses. The City House and the Country House. 

I never knew there was a Country House. When I was a little kid all the country was were farmers and hunters and riggers. I knew I wanted to be a rigger. I didn't know what I'd wind up being. I didn't know I'd have nearly killed the man who lead the city house. I never called it the City House. I just knew it as the Central House. I went there when I was twelve to apply for apprenticeship. I was denied. Even without parents I couldn't apply until I was sixteen. Two years of apprenticeship and then I would become a fellow. Fellows got the good pay. No one likes being a rigger. Most people didn't make it past apprenticeship before they left and went to drive carts or take some city job.

I was good at rigging. Taking down trees, moving them, digging, and building. It took a lot of work, and every day I was sore. That's why I went the the Backwoods Game Lounge. It was a place to relax and drink and just far enough to walk home and sober up some. Red came in one night. She was just a country girl who wanted a taste. Her first taste. I was seventeen. She was seventeen. I sat next to her and we hit it off. We were just sober enough to feel the electricity when we walked home.

I grabbed a drink from a water barrel just a minute ago. Terrible water. City people get the worst of it. No water here. Used to be very little food. That's what the real history told me. The real history told me about how the Houses were united. I'm not sure if United is the right word, when one just destroys the other. The ruler of the City House killed farmers and replaced them with his own men. He was clever about it. He sent his men in two years prior to his taking the seat at the City House. He was raised to be the ruler, and his first act was to take over the Country House. He saved the realm. He saved the cities. He killed men and women and tore down the Country House. That's the truth of it. 

The Wizard knew what I'd read, I know it. He knew I'd see past the history. He knew I'd see this as a prophecy. He knew that the ancient ruler was actually Shiloh Conners and that Shiloh killed my father and grandfather. Then he killed my wife. The ancient ruler was killed when he was 29, by a farmer's son. I am that farmer's son. It wasn't a history. It was a prophecy.

Jonas watched the new bug-zapper intently. He found it rewarding to see the mosquitoes that had plagued him for the past year and half simply fly into their oblivion. No more would he have to apply the stinking insect  repellent that had put a real hole in his wallet. He stood up out of his steel chair and into the warmth of the setting sun, it was around 7pm and he had decided to take the late night shift for some extra cash. He looked up the bleak highway that led to the station, it was empty, as per usual. Jonas was lucky to see 30 cars a day, and only around 10 of those would stop for gas. He spat on the ground indignantly and turned back to his seat, waiting for the darkness to roll in.

Roger tripped and fell into the dust. He grumbled and coughed up blood. He watched silently as it dripped from his lips and stained the earth an ugly crimson. He stretched his neck to look behind him. The searchlight was reversing direction away from him, he sighed in relief and lay flat on his back. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and realised that his lips were dry and cracked. Running from the cops in the desert could do that to a man. He knew he couldn't stay out there much longer, he was parched and it would get awfully cold soon, the Arizona desert did not retain any of the harsh midday heat. He lifted his head towards the small town and pulled himself to his feet. He staggered towards the town until he entered a small dusty parking lot. His feet had began to ache in his moccassins. There was but one car, an old looking Nissan. He brought himself the the passenger's side door and pulled a bobby pin from his leather jacket pocket. He'd stolen enough vehicles to know how to break into this old model.

Kate was glad that she was finally done with her paperwork. Half her department was off sick and she was expected to pick up the slack. She was paid overtime though, so she couldn't complain. She thrust the remainders of her work into her briefcase and closed it with a loud clack that reverberated around her vacant office. She stroked the hard leather casing softly, smiling as she thought of  her boyfriend who had bought it for her for her birthday, he knew she was a workaholic. They had just moved in together and she was excited to be back at home with him for the third night. She left the office with a skip in her step, whistling the tune to 'Friends'. She entered the dirt parking lot and stepped into her car, she went to put the key into the ignition but stopped, her car smelled different somehow. She decided to ignore the odd musty scent and started up the engine. 

**** 

Jonas shouted from his chair to the inside of the station. 
'How much today Rod?'
'Bout 78 bucks' the station shouted back. 
Jonas screwed up his nose in disgust, 78 dollars was poor, even for them. He wondered how the manager even paid them at the end of the week. The money certainly couldn't be coming from their station in the middle of nowhere. His partner, Roderick, stepped outside and looked at the bug-zapper.
'New toy Jonas?'
'Eeyup' Jonas replied 'Got it delivered today after 2 weeks of waitin, it's already paid itself off, them critters ain't bitin us no more'.
'Well shoot Jonas' Roderick laughed and smacked Jonas on the shoulder 'You've gone outdid yerself this time boy'
'Thankin you kindly' Jonas said, rubbing his shoulder, Roderick was stronger than he looked. Jonas looked back towards the road, dust was being kicked up. 'Incoming customer Rod' he said flatly. Roderick walked back into the store and stood behind the register. 

****

Kate sped along the long empty stretch of highway. She glanced at her gas meter, the needle was hovering dangerously close to E. She knew there was an old gas station along the road and resigned herself to visiting it before getting home. She was anxious to get home and so was irritable as she slowed down and entered the station. She rolled down her window slightly and looked out. The attendant was walking slowly towards her car. It was eerily silent, the only sound coming from a distant bug zapper frying mosquitos and the slow shuffle of the attendant's boots on the sand. Kate began to feel uncomfortable. She didn't like being alone with just this man on an empty stretch of desert. She rolled her window up a little more as he approached the window. 
'How much, ma'am?' he said in his annoying redneck accent. 
'Just a refill to the top' she said quickly. Wanting him to hurry up and get to it so she could leave this creepy place. But he didn't. He stayed at the window. She was about to tell him to leave when he moved to the back of her car, his eyes however, remained trained on her. She relaxed slightly as he left, realising she had been tensed up. Her relief didn't last for long as he popped back into view. 
'Ma'am?'
'What! What is it!' she shouted. 
'Uhh, you gotta open the cap'
'Oh,' she felt intensely embarassed having just raised her voice and forgetting to open the oil cap. She flicked a switch and it flipped open. She looked up at him. 
'Is that okay?' she asked impatiently. His eyes didn't leave hers, they were wide, almost frightened. 
'Yes, thank you' he said, voice trembling. Kate was getting more and more worked up, she didn't like this strange man who wouldn't stop staring. She thought of her boyfriend and how nice it would be to just get back to him, back to safety.
'Ma'am? It's done, that'll be 34 dollars and 62 cents, how dya want to pay?'
'Card' she said curtly, passing her card to him through the slit in the window. He took it from her, his gaze still firmly fixed upon her. Kate narrowed her eyes and looked at his dirty face, it seemed like he was looking right through her. Suddenly, he turned on his heel and walked back towards the station. She sighed and felt her chest, her heart was hammering. She wished for him to just hurry up so she could leave this horrible station with it's creepy attendant in the middle of some god-forsaken desert. Then, like her wish had been granted, he was back at her window. 
'Ma'am, there's an issue with your card, could you please' he swallowed oddly 'step out of the vehicle so we can sort it out?'
He had come back too soon, Kate knew that there was no chance of him checking the card and discovering an issue that fast. She began to shake in fear. 'There's no issue! You didn't even ch-ch-check it!' Kate shouted back, aware that she was stuttering again. 
'Ma'am, there's an issue, please step out' he said, his voice weird and shaky. Kate couldn't take much more.
'Cash then!' she shrieked, tossing 50 dollars out of the crack in the window. The attendant held her gaze, ignoring the note.
'Ma'am' he warbled, 'please. Just step out'. She noticed a tear running down his cheek and pleading in his eyes. It was too strange. Kate tore her eyes from him and accelerated, ripping the pump from the cap and leaving the attendant in the dust. Kate had escaped his clutches.

****
Jonas stood in disbelief. He watched as the car sped away from him until it was out of sight entirely. He collapsed to the floor and sobbed violently. Roderick heard him and rushed outside to his broken partner. 
'Jonas!' he shouted as he reached him. He place his big hands on to Jonas' shoulders and looked down at the smaller man. 'What's wrong lad?' 
Jonas raised his head and looked Roderick in the eyes. 'I couldn't save her man, I failed.' he spluttered through sobs. 
'Who? Who couldn't you save? The customer?' Roderick said, his voice shaking, he had never seen Jonas anything but subtly annoyed. 
'The girl' Jonas said after a few minutes stony silence, 'the girl in the car, I tried man, but I couldn't tell her.'
'Tell her what?' Rod said softly, concerned. 
'About him' Jonas said flatly, he was no longer crying.
'Who? About who?'
'He was in the leg room of the passenger seat, man. He was just waiting there.'
'Who Jonas? Who was it?' Roderick shouted, shaking Jonas' small frame.
'The man in the leather jacket and dusty moccassins. He had a knife in his hand and a finger to his lips.'

The young man handed a ten dollar bill across the counter, exchanging it for the freshly wrapped flowers the lady gave him.
A lovely bouquet, she said. He smiled, thanked her, and walked out of the market pavilion, exiting onto the downtown side street. 

The late afternoon was bright and hot and the dewy flowers glistened optimistically. He headed down the street clutching the bouquet, passing market patrons and other sidewalkers, holding the flowers tightly to avoid them being jostled.

He passed through a crowd gathered at a bus stop, avoiding eye contact where possible. Two shirtless, rudely tattooed men sat reclined against a convenience store looking at him. 

Faggot, one muttered, hoping his buddy thought he was overheard, hoping he was not overheard. 

Probably.

The young man proceeded down the busy city thoroughfare, passing restaurant patios where glasses clinked and couples laughed. A group of ladies in large sunglasses and large necklaces drinking cocktails ogled him quietly as we walked by. He heard them titter and coo and knew their looks followed him. He would be the subject of their conversation for a few minutes.

He paused at a corner, putting the flowers into the crook of his arm to light a cigarette. A large, Greek-lettered man asked approaching him from across the street.

Yo man, could I bum a dart off you bro? he asked while groping his pocket for a lighter.

Sure.

Thanks bro. Cool flowers dude.

Thanks.

Take ‘er easy man, and he walked off back across the street, leaving the young man to light his own cigarette.

He took a few drags before starting down the street again. It was very warm, and sweat pooled on his back. He decided to cut down a shaded alley and get off the main street. His shoes sounded on the chipped asphalt as he stepped off the sidewalk over a torn garbage bag and into the cool, fetid air of the alley. Old brick rose on both sides and the flaked paint of some decayed mural remained visible beneath the city grime. 

The alley exited onto a nearly vacant parking lot, and he crossed the hot pavement towards the street. He flipped his half-smoked cigarette back into the alley to join its numerous kin. The moisture had long since evaporated from the flowers he gripped, and their original lustre had faded.

The street was less busy than the one he had just left and he was thankful. The only person visible was a homeless man sitting on a spread of cardboard sipping from a worn paper cup. The young man considered crossing the street to avoid contact but decided it would be too obvious.

Spare some change? 

Sorry, he answered looking away as he walked passed quickly.
I’ll take those flowers instead.

Ha, he stated and didn’t break his pace.

The street exited onto another main road and he took a right onto it, joining the herds of people swarming along the sidewalk and the traffic oozing between intersections. Buskers played on either side, and between the noise of engines and tires and voices, acoustic music was audible there, percussion there, and a wailing street person there. 

His mouth was dry and his feet swam in his shoes. There was a Starbucks just ahead and he decided to stop for an ice water.
The line was long, almost to the door, but it was densely air conditioned inside and it cut through the sweaty grit that covered him. He stood as the line slowly progressed forward, the haggard baristas pouring ices and syrups into taxed blenders. He got to the front of the line and ordered his water. The cashier smiled with relief for the brief respite.

Those are beautiful flowers, who’s the lucky g—person? she asked, but he was already moving to the pickup table and her question was ground out in the sound of masticating ice.

He grabbed his water and moved through the crowded café towards the exit. A girl in a short sundress was coming through and he held the door for her with his elbow, hands clutching flowers and water.

Thanks, she said looking up at him, smiling.

You’re welcome, he said, returning her smile.

They paused for a moment, her looking at the flowers in his hand. Her smile dropped and she stepped passed him without another word. The young man exited out of the cool air into the city street.
The sidewalks were filling with nine to fivers finished the grind, inappropriately dressed for the sunny heat. They shoved passed him on both sides headed towards parking lots and bus stops, desperate to get home. He sipped his water and moved slowly upstream against the city.

Despite his best efforts the flowers were getting jostled. A small yellow carnation was crushed down and in, the cellophane folding over it. He stopped at a garbage and discarded his cup and ice, pausing to readjust the crumpled flower, unfolding the plastic from over it. 

He crossed the street to cut across the park. Large trees shaded couples sprawled on benches, eating, laughing. He watched as they held hands and touched each other. Teenagers sitting too close, kissing too hard, listening to music too loud. They watched videos on their phones and they sat in each other’s laps. He walked across the grass watching them frankly. No one watched him. 

The grass ended and concrete began. His destination was just up the street and he could see the squat grey building sprawled before him. He was a bit later than intended. He wanted another cigarette but didn’t want to smell like smoke. 

He got to the parking lot and stopped. Cars were pulling out and he stopped to let them pass. The drivers looked at him. He climbed the steps to the front of the building and stopped. The large doors and a small garbage can with cigarette butts littered around it stood before him. He stood.

Fuck.

He took the decaying bouquet and shoved it into the ashy garbage. 

Fuck.

Gripping the door handle he pulled hard and entered the building.

Venetian in their namesake, the blinds are the crux of my being. I roll myself off the bed and onto the floor which is thankfully still bathed in shadow. My breathing is quick and shallow from preforming that singular feat, an obvious sign of the cigarettes last night, though I needed no telling as my swollen tongue could taste. I wipe the sweat from my brow as the carpet rubs my nude back, my eyes stay shut as I wonder what happened last night. I creep my hand along the carpet, a hermit crab combing the beach for solace, hearing the circling squawks overhead, feeling the sun beat down on it. My hand finds solace. I twist the cap off and take a sip. 


   It’s making late payments on bills, payments just touching the minimum, drowning in debt as I still place the bottle to my lips for a drink. The jingling quarters in my pocket are the rhythm section behind the automated ding accompanying the liquor store door. The rhythm section marches with me leaving the other pieces behind, this parade route swings by the gin shelves because it’s early in the month and the bills don’t have to be paid yet. The lady at the first cash served me three days ago; I head to the second line. On the way out I hold the door for an entering customer around my age; I can hear his pocket jingling. I don’t make eye contact. 

   Once home I place the new bottle beside the empty one on my desk (kitchen table) and open my word processor (booklet of paper). This, not drinking cheap alcohol or smoking bummed cigarettes, is the true struggle. I don’t drink because life is unfair; I drink because my main character keeps being a fucking dick when he’s supposed to be the “Hero”. How can I not pull a cigarette from the battered pack I stole last night when my female lead sleeps with her best friend’s man behind her husband’s back? What about when my twenty year old protagonist drinks his way out of university? That must deserve a drink. I’ll fight with them, yell at them, tell them about the damage they’re doing, show them their reflections, add soliloquys, but it never does any good. I’ll keep trying to write them in the right way while the sun falls and the bottle empties. I’ll fight until the phone rings, and my friend invites me to the pub. He’ll tell me not to fuck up like I did last night, and I’ll laugh and apologize as I gather my coat promising to be there in 15 minutes. On the way out the door I’ll stop by the kitchen table and look over the unfinished stories and the stubborn characters, they’ll look back at me and without an ounce of guilt ask:

Picture two houses across the street from one another. They looked perfectly normal and sturdy on the outside, but on the inside they were run down and falling apart. Inside of one lived a quiet and peaceful man, and in the other lived a beautiful and cheerful woman. Neither of them, however, liked being outside the confines of their own house.

One day, the peaceful man ventured across the street to the other house and was invited inside. The two strangers visited, shared laughs, told stories, and enjoyed the others company. At the end of the day, the man returned to his house.

The next day he visited again, but instead of talking, he started to slowly repair the inside of the run down house. When one of his repairs would break, he would immediately come over to fix the damage with a smile on his face. The two housekeepers became used to seeing one another each day, and eventually, the woman would come over to the man's house to visit. The woman noticed that his house looked much worse on the inside than hers, and started to sneak inside at night while he was asleep to make repairs. When the man would try to fix something himself, or repair damages to his own house, he would fail, and sometimes even make things worse. But the next morning,  he would notice that things would be fixed. This puzzled the man and he decided to ask the woman about it the next time she came over.

The next evening they spent together, he asked and she informed the man of what she had been doing, and the man asked why. She replied,
""Because people who show a caring and wholesome heart deserve to receive the same treatment they give to others."" The man became confused.
          ""But I am a shut in. Nobody gives to me, and I don't give to them. Why does somebody like me deserve somebody as wonderful as you?""

The woman put her hand on the man's shoulder and looked into his dark brown eyes. She noticed a hurt that had always seemed to hide beneath his smile, a sorrow that hadn't been revealed in a very long time. She said in a soft and gentle voice: ""Somebody that prefers to be alone does not always prefer being lonely. There is always somebody who will care.""

The two embraced, and the man sobbed and became limp in the woman's arms. Once he had calmed down, the woman kissed him on the cheek and returned to her house without saying a word.

The following morning, he noticed another man performing landscaping on her lawn, painting the outside of her house, and cleaning her patio. Each day the house would look more and more beautiful. He became sad that the woman had found somebody else to do her work, and started to loathe the landscaper that would beautify her house all the time.

The woman remained indoors all day, trying to make the interior of her house look as pleasant as the exterior. However, most of her attempts at repairs or renovation were disasters. The person she hired was no help, and was only after her money. She began to miss her neighbors company, along with his sturdy repairs and his gentle smile. As days went by, the man and woman thought about each other more and more, but never saw each other.

One afternoon, the woman heard her doorbell ring. Knowing it wasn't the landscaper she hired, she curiously approached the peephole of the door. Seeing that nobody was outside, she opened the door and looked for pranksters. Looking down, she saw a small, dirty looking tin with a bow neatly placed on top of it.

The interior of the unkempt tin was extravagantly decorated with soft velvet from top to bottom, and in the center laid a simple necklace with a key on it, resting on top of a small note. Putting the necklace on, she unfolded the small note and noticed little droplets of water on the page.

""You are the only one that can make it feel less empty. Please take care of it for me while I'm gone. I must go, but I will return one day.""

After reading it the woman dropped to her knees, and tears started to form in her tightly shut eyes. For what seemed like years, she spent the next few months wishing the man would come back and going into his house to take care of it while he was gone. She noticed that every little thing she had done to the house remained unchanged, as if he never tried to correct the small mistakes she had made.

Eventually, the man returned. The woman was thrilled and filled with happiness, but also saddened by the fact that the man no longer came across the street to visit her. A few days after his return, she noticed he was packing his belongings into boxes. Fearing that he might move away, the woman mustered up the courage to go talk to the man.

""Why are you putting everything into boxes?"" The woman asked.
    ""Because,"" the man replied solemnly, ""I am looking to create new memories and find a fresh start."" The woman said nothing and returned to her house, slamming the door and fighting back tears.

The next morning, the man was loading his belongings into a moving truck when he saw a pile of boxes bigger than his own sitting in the woman's lawn. He walked across the street to the pile, and saw a note taped to one of the boxes.

""I will always love you, and I promise that I will always be next to you. No matter where we go.""

The man's face turned into a broad smile, and he looked up to see the woman on her front patio, looking right back at him, the necklace glistening in the sunlight. She ran into his arms and they kissed for what felt like an eternity. The pair continued to load all of their belongings into the one moving truck, and left that very evening. Holding hands with his true love, the man looked into the rear view mirror to see the sun setting on the old, abandoned houses for the last time, and felt what was truly a pure happiness. An odd and relieving sensation washed over him like a tide, as he realized that he would never have to search for anything in his life, as long as he lived.

The Cycle 
- By Blacktyde 


                                               

- Four hundred....fifty..hmm..everyone remain still! 
- What are you counting?
- ..seven, eight...eighty. 
- Well! About one billion six hundred and fifty give or take a few. 
Not a bad turn out this time around. 
- This time..?
- Alright! Total restart! Time to bring em around again. 
- Restart!? hey!
- Oh quiet.I’ll see you again in a moment or two.
- Relax for what? what’s being restarted? where am I?
- So many questions!
- There would be less if you’d answer them!
- Oh and some attitude too! 
- You have to understand my frustration! 
- I don't have to do anything 
- I'm sorry if I'm being demanding, I’m confused...thats all.
- Thats quite alright, after something like that, who would have a few questions?
- right! and answers would be a wonderful addition to them.
- Well ok then, one at a time. 
-Alright, who are you?
- HAH thats your first question? who else could I be? 
- I guess I should’ve known, you know, because of what happened.
- Yes, theres not many that can cause something like that. 
- I suppose, how about one more? 
- Ask away! 
- what’s being restarted? 
- Humanity of course!.
- Humanity!? how would you restart all of humanity? 
- Its simple really, for me anyway. 
- But it just ended! right?

- Yes it did! And now its going to start! again!
- What? Why restart it? 
- Because you’re not all here.
- Whos not all here?
- Humans, my creations. There seems to be a few billion missing, thats certainly not a small amount to leave behind. 
- Yeah...the ones that don’t deserve to be here are left behind. Thats the point. 
- Who exactly are the ones that don’t deserve to be here?
- the others! The non believers of course! 
- Believe it or not, you were all non believers at one point. 
- But we are not now!
- True. You all have found your way. Thats all it is. The others are just lost. Thats why you need another restart. Do it all over again. Until they find their way.
- But they won’t! They rejected you!
- But you didn't! You all did not!
- Well obviously...I de-...we dedicated our lives to you! 
- Yes I know, but you, along with many other new faces I see, we're not here the previous times. And yes you did finally dedicate your life to me, and you’ll dedicate many, many more. 
- What do you mean many more? Reincarnation? 
- Hmm I suppose, it is a Reincarnation in a way...yes. 
- But you promised us an eternity with you. Here, in heaven. this is heaven isn’t it? I mean, I assume it is. Thats where we go after the rapture.
 - Oh no, that was no rapture. 
- What do you mean? The world ended! All the signs were there. And we all got pulled at once. To..here. Wherever here is. 
- I know, I did it remember? Oh...I suppose you wouldn't would you.. it was only a few moments ago but, not to you.
- You’ve lost me. 
- Humanity is just, well, a cycle. The world restarts, and you believers and nonbelievers are sent back through. Its only a few moments to me but...a lifetime to you.
- Sent back through? Why on earth would you do that?
- As I said before. You’re not all here. This cycle will continue to happen until you’re all here. 
- Well how does that work exactly? 
- Well, have you ever thought that, someones life is planned out, before they even exist?
- Yes, predestination right?
- Precisely! You, along with the rest of the people here now, have earned it.
- Earned it? I always thought of it more as a curse than a reward. you pre setting our choices before we even make them, takes away our free will altogether.
- Not your choices all together, just your choice in belief. 
- I still don't see how thats a reward. 
- Before you earn this reward, you make the choices yourselves! And once you make the right ones, you end up here. 
- But don't you, as,well...you, choose who will be predestined before the beginning of time? 
- Yes, I make it before the beginning of time, every time I restart time. Do you follow?
- You’re confusing but I'm trying. 
- Every time I end the cycle. The people who believed and worshiped and glorified me will, be sent back through with the ones who didn't but since they’re predestined, they will always end up here again, however many more times it takes, you will always end up back here.
- And the people who don’t believe? They always...wont end up back here?
- No! Of course not! They have the freewill to choose or not to choose to follow me. I decide not to know, in advance, their choice. keeping their choices, THEIR choices. 
- And more believers come back each time?
- Thats the idea. 
- I'm beginning to understand the point of this cycle. you let them choose you, then once they do, they are predestined to choose you in future lives, to avoid hell and what not. 
- More on the “what not” side, but basically yes. 
-  But why not predestin all the people to believe? - Why keep this cycle going?
- Why? Thats how it must be! Restarting life until they do it correctly. Until they deserve to move on! To fulfill the purpose of life. 
- Which is?
- More questions hm? Well... you tell me. What do you, as a believer, do throughout your lives? 
- Well..worship, Pray, Try not to sin...You know..
- But why do that stuff? Why live like that?
- To be a good person I suppose..you want your followers to be good people? To stand out?
- Partially... Well how about this, if you have a child, and your child is presented with an opportunity to steal some toy, or candy he really wants. And he doesn't. what does that do for you, the parent?
 - It makes me proud of my child of course 
 - And how does your child’s choices reflect on you, from the view of others? 
- It makes me look like a great parent.
- Yes! One could say, it brings..glory?
- So you’re saying its all for creating an image for yourself?
- Right. Creations glorifying their creator. 
- Seems a bit self centered!
- I made you, I made you all! Is a little appreciation too much to ask? 
- I suppose not, so the point of us, your creations, is to bring you glory? 
- Yes thats the purpose of humanity! To bring glory to your creator. Through your actions and choices. And show the others his greatness. 
- Thats a lot of work just for glory.
-  I created you, I should get what I made you for. I deserve it don't I?
- Yes but I still don’t see why everyone can’t be predestined....the act does not become less good if everyone’s doing it.
- You’re right. But if I am standing next to my child and I make him not steal the toy, its not really his choice. And no glory comes from that. To anyone. 
- Ah I see. the choice must be made by their own free will first. Before they are saved. 
- Exactly! And once they’ve freely made that choice, They are saved for all eternity! as was promised. 
- So we just redo the same earth over and over again?
- Ehhh..not exactly, you are not the same people, or gender. Or even in the same time period. its completely random, wherever your soul ends up. Its a gamble really. 
- Well...who does that leave us as? When we finally return? Do we keep the soul of who we were last?
-  Yes! Along with all the others!
- Others? Our past souls join us also? How would that work?
- Ah always a question. You know you won’t remember any of this in a moment right?
 - I don’t care.
- Well you see. Your all one soul. Split into many.
 -I don’t understand
- When you’re all here. You all have the same soul. You will be in a different body. A body that has nothing to do with human definition. 
- So we are all one person?
- In a way, but separate. 
- You’re not making sense again. I need more of an explanation! 
- You’re getting there! Your mind still can't wrap itself around this yet. 
- Well help me wrap it around! Help me understand.
- Come now. Lets leave something to talk about next time hm?
- I hate the idea of waiting that long...even if I don't know it 
- Oh you'll be back here in no time at all. 
- Yes but I won't remember this conversation
- Its alright. I have the time to explain again. Maybe even further next time. if you’re up to it! 
- How does this restart happen anyway?
- A split second here. And eternity for you between each cycle. It really blows even my mind. You all become smarter and smarter each time around, and the discussion goes further and further. I take great pride in them, They truly do bring me glory... well, lets see now.

“The “you” that I believe is you, is an interpretation of a perceived reality. If there is a “real” you, you must be nothing like what I believe you to be, but something entirely unknowable to me. If there is a “you”, you exist at a point in time and space that I will never reach; nor will I ever be able to objectively observe what exists there. It is impossible for me to prove your existence beyond the framework of my own mind. Therefore it is irrational for me to believe in you” He said, his voice rising. “ I cannot believe in you! I do not believe in you!” 

With that, the philosophers wife disappeared instantly, leaving behind only the faint “pop” of air rushing in to fill the vacuum where she had once been. “Aha!” said the philosopher, so you were an illusion all along! Logic and reason have triumphed over the untrustworthy human senses!” The philosopher turned on his side, and slept comfortably.

The next evening, the philosopher turned to the empty space on the other side of his bed and said “I miss you.”

Now imagine a place. A place of the color white. This place has no dimensions, nothing filling its space. No air, no walls, no heat, no matter. Can you see it? Good. But this place is not bare. In this place there is a box, a box sat on a stool sat on the nothing in this place. This box and its stool are white, and invisible as they blend into this place. You want to know what’s inside the box, I’m sure. I would like to tell you what’s inside the box; that would make certainly be of convenience to the both of us. But I can’t tell you, oh, no. You must find out for yourself. How can you find out what’s in the box? I have pondered this very question for ages. One’s first thought would be to simply open it and look at all the secrets within. But that’s impossible, I’m afraid. Remember, this box on this stool in this place has no matter, no droplets of energy dancing around its surface. It is nothing. It’s not even there. But how can it not be there when I clearly told you of its existence? Look at the place once more. It is a white vacuum; nothing contained within, because there is no within. But you just saw the box, how could this be? Well, my friend, I’m afraid that’s where you went wrong. The box is white, the stool is white, the place is white. These items can not be seen by the human eye. And when seeing is believing, it is safe to assume that what we can’t see is not there. You feel betrayed now. How could I have knowingly given you the false image of a box on a stool in this place? You are confused. Well, it’s all just standard practice, friend. But I’m glad you made it this far into my written words. Most lose patience after the first mention of the box, while they hastily try to figure out a way to unlock its secrets. How foolish they are. They have lost themselves in their own imaginations, in places with stools and boxes that don’t exist. We must remind ourselves of what is and what isn’t, of what can and cannot be.

1372992738.0,1,self.shortstories,1ho53k,Untitled,SethIsInSchool,3,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ho53k/untitled/,"My father (Walter) married Darcy in 1992 after six months of acquaintance, at the terrifying prospect of dying alone. In 2007 Walter O’Driscoll bought a dog and formed a stronger companionship with it than that of the one with his wife. The dog had anxiety problems and would incessantly vomit regardless of location or time. It was this trait coupled with the purchase of a new entryway rug that drove Mrs. O’Driscoll to get rid of the dog, and it was this that drove Walter to burn down the house with her inside. This story is true.
	
Walter was 61 years old come September. He worked at a company that sold cleaning products which, yes, is as boring as it sounds. But Walter didn’t mind boring. You see, a belief he’d held onto since he was a teen was that doing boring things is like meditating. And so he did so for nine hours a day. And then he would continue being bored well after he got home until he went to bed (in a separate room from his wife’s), and he would read a boring book, and then dream boring dreams (sometimes of reading boring books), and then wake up and eat (boring) breakfast.
	
Life was predictable for Walter. One day while reading the paper, he realized he had been living his life in the future; when he was driving to work, he imagined himself already at work, packaging cleaning product, and when he got to work it was exactly what he expected. While he was packaging cleaning product, he was thinking about watching television with his dog. In fact, for an old man with so little future ahead of him, he spent an unusually large amount of time thinking about it.
	
The only time that Walter wasn’t hyper-aware of his boredom and thinking about the future was when he was sitting in his chair watching TV, his dog in his lap. After a couple episodes of whatever was on television, it ran off to some other part of the house. Walter wasn’t alone in his chair for long when Darcy’s shrill, French voice preceded her entry into the living room.

“That damn dog puked on the cahpet!” she said, each angry word bleeding into the next. She said more things but he turned on the subtitles for the TV and feigned deafness until she stomped off ranting about the poor little dog.
	
A week later he arrived home from work to Darcy walking briskly out of the house yelling. Her attempts to make herself heard were futile as Walter had the windows up so that all that penetrated the glass were muffled bass notes. He stepped out of the car.
	
“- Rug again. Get rid of that dog! Get rid of it-” he tuned her out again.
	
That night he sat in his chair with his dog in his lap, watching whatever on TV. Dinner was boring, just as he expected. In bed, he dreamed of working in the factory.
	
The next day, he went to work, just as previously described, and worked all day, just as he’d imagined the night before. When he got home, things began to veer off from their normal path. Darcy didn’t come out to meet him in the driveway to complain today. In fact, the house was eerily quiet, although he couldn’t quite place what it was that was so different. When he got to the door, he realized what it was- the dog wasn’t barking. He stepped inside. Darcy was standing in the kitchen with her hands on her hips.
	
“You were taking too long to get rid of the dog so I did.”
	
He didn’t listen anymore, rather walked to his chair and watched TV.
	
She complained about other things, but the complaints fell on falsely deaf ears.
	
That night, instead of going to bed, he stayed up awhile. The orange glow from the lamps throughout the house reflected off the windows making it impossible to see outside. The TV had been off for some time. When Darcy’s cruel snoring came through the walls, he made his way downstairs and dug through little odds and ends until he found a can of mogas. He took it upstairs with him and poured it all through the house, making extra sure to douse the entryway rug, and the area outside her Darcy’s bedroom door, then lit a match and dropped it on the trail. 
	
As he made his way back to his room he reflected on all of his life spent in boredom. He did not regret it, but he was tired now. He could hear the crackling of the flames growing louder and louder, and eventually, the shrill calls of the woman to whom he was married. He entered his bedroom, which was, again, not shared with his wife. Walter pulled his slippers off his feet and lay down in his small bed. The house was getting hotter, and with every second he lay there he became more tired, then he fell asleep.

There are beings in this forest that do not take kindly to trespassers.” 
Becc ran to catch up with his father, not stopping until he was behind the Conn of his village. His father was chosen as Conn before he was born, it was a title of honor and respect, bestowed unto those whose deeds of valor in battle were legendary. Becc was the exact opposite of his father. He was small and timid and had never even swung a sword in his life. In fact, Becc had never done much to contribute to village life, always being side lined by his father on the simplest of tasks. Once, His father had refused to let him spear fish on the River Fial with the other boys. More water had flown from Becc’s eyes that day than all the rivers on the continent of Dulra. 
“Father,” He pleaded as salty tears stung his cheeks. “My tenth day of birth is long past and you still refuse to let me leave the walls of our village. Why?” The young boy could feel his father’s cold eyes burning into him. This is useless he had thought, before turning his back on the man who had raised him from birth. 
“Becc,” The Conn’s commanding voice had shot through the boy like hot knives, stopping him in his tracks. He did not want to turn around to face him, but was guided by a rough, familiar hand on his shoulder. He gazed at his father, his vision blurred by the mask of tears that clouded his eyes. The man who had served their village as Conn was not cruel, nor would he purposely hurt his own son. Becc knew this, for his father had taught him all about their ancient continent and the dangers that lay outside the safety of their village. He confines me for my own sake; I am too weak for the outside world. What if I ran into a Druid, or even worse… A Sage. Father had always taught him that life was a precious thing and it would be careless to through it away so easily in the wastelands of Dulra. “Remember our lessons Becc, beyond these hallowed walls hides a land that is fraught with despair and darkness. I have seen what is to see, I have heard what is to hear, and I have tasted what is not to be tasted. The stains of blood do not wash off so easily, from our clothing, or from our minds.”
 
Becc was older now, but no more experienced at anything than he was back then. This was only the fourth time he had ventured out into the wilderness, all of them had been trailing in the wake of his father’s shadow. It was clear a boy of fourteen was not to be trusted alone.

Some of them sheared their fluff, donated it to charity, sent it to some remote country in OuagaBongo, or maybe they made cozy bonfires with it, sat around it, playing an acoustic guitar while screaming beautiful songs. That made everything absolutely fine. They were against the system, they had cleansed their soul, and were ready for the prize. The final big prize sitting somewhere above this waiting room, on the higher floors, where the ever-so-close beams of light, blinding pillars descending from the heavens, were nowhere to be found. Oh, on the higher floors, rooms are *not* cramped.
The walls breathe. 
The *rooms* breathe.
They inhale fresh clean air which only gold can buy, holding it in, passionately savoring it, like a sacred elixir that grants eternal life.
Then... they calmly exhale.
Breathing radioactive clouds into the scraper's skeleton, into the core of the steel frame supporting this decaying structure. This decadent world.

Stratospheres below, in the squalid, greasy room, the mass of flesh keeps on moving and morphing. The faces that stood out, they popped out like mushrooms in autumn, devouring the stagnant air, stealing it from other starving mouths. All of them, waiting. (Relatively) eternally waiting. Waiting for what? Waiting for something magical to happen. Waiting for Nora Helmer's ""miracle"" to happen. Waiting for a great plateau. The peak of their meagre existence. Once they reached the summit, their personal Mount Everest, with all the unholy crosses and sacred duties weighted on their shoulders, then they plummeted down the other side. With the blink of an eye, they simply plunged into a black abyss. *The* black abyss. The one and only! The one we *aaaaall* stumble into eventually. Maybe tomorrow, maybe in a month, or maybe in 10 years. In the end, we all turn grey, like old family pictures in an old family book. In the end, we all fade away. But not *them*.

They're here to stay. They're so far away, their fingers can touch the sky; they can grab the stars with their bare hands and extinguish them with their toxic breath.
They don't occupy the rooms, they *are* the rooms.
They're omniscient beings, their eyes open, blood-red cracks in the smoked walls. The devilish eyes pulse in the darkness.
If you listen, you can hear a soft whisper.
Many whispers.
Coming from every side.
Every corner.
Gentle murmurs fill up the room like little bugs, *tick ticking* across the room with their vast assortment of tiny prickly legs.
If you close your eyes, their secret buzzing starts crawling along your spine, lifting every little hair along the way.
If you're lucky, you can feel the whispers writhing under your skin.
Little bumps filled with unutterable secrets appear and disappear on your body.
The bugs cannot be deciphered, their whispers just linger in the room, floating in the damp air. With every pulse, the cracks in the wall seem to charge with energy. With every pulse, low tones make the walls vibrate. Dust particles are shaken off. A thick bass lets blood seep through the cracks in the wall, through the all-seeing eyes of this room. This *entity*. 

The Big Big Brothers and Big Sisters of the monolithic structure. They're always watching. Through kilometers and kilometers of invisible cobwebs, they can see all. They can *feel* all.
They crawl around like sneaky tarantulas or mighty goliath bird-eaters. They find a nice spot, and then they simply wait.
And wait.
Waiting for the best moment to strike. To sink their poison-filled fangs into their prey. To devour. To consume. To feed on the sorrow of the weak, of the lesser beings. Of those who are (relatively) patiently waiting below. Faaaaar far below. In the catacombs of this *depravingly* gigantic structure.

Two of the crews had already turned in their data for the day and I would, again, miss dinner. My weather map wasn’t done and the plotter had seized from the cold. In order to warm it up, I had to turn on the heaters, which blew the fuses in the generator, which had been having problems with generating a consistent amount of voltage, all fire long. It was going to be a long night. 

Of course, I couldn’t let on about any of these problems to incident command. There was Brookstone’s reputation to worry about. I didn’t let on to Brookstone how easy the mapping was, though, either. Overtime paid for my recreation. No one questioned as long as I didn’t miss deadlines.

“Wow. You guys always have the best equipment. Didn’t I see you at the… Dogwood Fire, in Utah?” Marsh is what his name tag read. Covered in grime and ash, Eric handed me his Garmin. 

“Thanks. Always good to hear that. Yeah. Weren’t you at the Calaveras Complex Fire, as well?” It was always good to establish credibility through history. As a contractor, it was often hard to earn respect. Especially, with Smokejumpers and Hotshots.  The data took only a few seconds to download.

“Yeah, that’s right. That was a few years, ago. Were you doing maps, there? You look a little young. No offense.”

“None taken. No. I was running the fuel trucks, there. Glorified gas station attendant, really. Start time and stop time?” He flipped through a notepad, before answering.

“05:12 to 20:06. Fuel trucks, huh? Been moving up in the world?”

“Sideways. I always seem to move sideways. This look like your line?” He studied the screen.

“That was fast. Yeah. That’s it.” I handed back his Garmin.

“How much does this thing cost, for a day?”

“Depends on a number of things. For this fire, it is relatively inexpensive, because we have a lot of other equipment, here.” I always avoided detailing specifics in price. No one ever instructed me to, but it seemed like a good policy.

“Ah, so that is why, when we see you guys, you have set up the whole base camp.”

“Exactly. Everything but the kitchens, usually.”

“So, is Brookstone going to make a million dollars on this fire, or what?”

“Ha. Maybe so. I’d have to sit down with a calculator to figure, exactly.” I had already calculated, in my head, roughly, once camp was setup. Tents, generators, light towers, portable toilets, water tenders, potable water truck, shower unit, GIS module, helo module… we were easily doing fifty grand a day.

“Then you should buy my crew a drink, after we get this one knocked down… if they don’t shuffle us off, right after demob.”

“Deal. I can throw it on the company card. Maybe I’ll finally convince that bartender to finally sell me some of that mammoth ivory.”

And that was the first charge on the company card I got yelled at for. 21 beers… per round. The Salmon River Brewery was a good time. I never did get any of that mammoth ivory, but I did make friends with Eric Marsh and Jesse Steed. Hotshots are always easy for me to get along with. Interagency nomads, we traversed the wilds and trucked into infernos, both figurative and literal. I wouldn’t see Jesse again, but I would never forget the imposing, frowning figure he made, with his arms folded in the command tent, tattoo exposed of a mattock crossed with a shovel, surrounded by flames. I never would have guessed they would have died together, years later.

Mistakes were made. If you are always aware of the “watch out” situations, then you have enough situational awareness to not get killed in a fire. Just like in scuba diving, we stop and try to separate ourselves from the people we knew and concern about what families and friends will think. These discussions need to be had. No one dies if the rules are followed. It is that simple. 3, 5, 6, 7 and 12 are the ones that always make your skin crawl during initial attack.

4. Unfamiliar with weather and local factors influencing fire behavior 
8. Constructing line without safe anchor point. 
15. Wind increases and/or changes direction.
17. Terrain or fuels make escape to safety zones difficult.  

They let four go, at least, to end up in this situation. I can only wonder what the lookout was seeing from his vantage, thinking in his mind, saying on the radio. He was the only one in the Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew to survive. I remember the first firefighter death that happened while I was on an incident. He climbed under a brush truck, deployed his shelter, and laid on his radio button. It took over the channel. We listened to the whole thing in the communications trailer that had just suffered a power loss from one of the generators failing. It would have been better if we had waited to fix it.

The shelters are mylar-like, to reflect the radiant heat. They are somewhat primitive, and, though they may save your life, if you have to deploy, you are still going to get burned really, really bad. Many report considering suicide by smoke inhalation to make the burning stop. The water in your canteen boils out and becomes steam, adding another kind of burn. You are supposed to drink the water from your canteen, but, in practice I learned just how difficult that could be.

And that is the thought I have of my friend and the crew he commanded; huddled together in the largest group of shelters ever deployed by a hotshot crew, breathing in scant air with dust from the little screens at the bottom of the shelter, adjusting and shuffling blindly away from the heat en masse. Crying, screaming, praying. Burning. Wishing they had set up an anchor point.

That is exactly why I stopped doing it. Those are exactly the thoughts I never want to have about people I know and care about.

Let it burn. From New Mexico, where fire season starts, to the coast of California. Learn to swim.

He felt as if it was biting the inside of his septum. Other than the smell he was unable to sense anything. All he could see was darkness. He tried to touch his fingers to his palms but felt nothing. 

For several minutes Ryan pondered his situation. Could he still be dreaming? He didn’t feel as if he was in a dream, rather he felt as if he had been sleeping for days but was finally awake. He had heard of a condition called “sleep paralysis”. Perhaps this was causing his lack of sensation, but why then could he not see the faint glow of his alarm clock or the whizzing of the cars going past his downtown studio apartment. 
	
After what felt like hours, Ryan’s anxiety began to build. “Could I have had a stroke in my sleep? Is that why I can’t feel anything?” Ryan asked himself further elevating his already high blood pressure. Just as Ryan was coming to grips with his own impending demise he started smelling something else, almost like a frying hamburger. 
	
“FUCK!” Ryan cried. All of the sudden he could feel intense pain coursing throughout his entire body. It felt as if all of his muscles had just been pounded by a meat tenderizer. His feeling had certainly returned, however any attempt at moving was met with even sharper pain.

Ryan could sense a fine mist spraying his body. This is when he realized he was naked. His sense of sight and hearing were returning. He could hear a faint hum, like that of a microwave. He saw shadows in front him of what looked like people, stumbling around. The realization that he was not in his apartment, lying in his own bed had sunk in.

The pain began to subside, replaced with a dull numbness that Ryan prefered. He took a step forward, pushing the tinted glass door in front of him. He could now hear screaming.
As he walked out into the large circular chamber he could see fifty or sixty men and women, naked like him, stumbling around, shouting and crying; 

“Help!”


“Where the hell am I?”

“What is this?”

“Let me out of here!”

Ryan tried to form the words “I’m cold” but was unable to get enough breath behind his speech. He saw hundreds of capsules surrounding him. The chamber was lined with them, stacked over several stories. Most had their glass openings ajar, although a few people still seemed to be emerging from the walls. 
On the other side of the chamber was a large arched opening. Ryan could see groups of people heading in that direction, so he followed. As he got closer he noticed he felt warmer and warmer. As he neared his destination he began to feel almost comfortable with the temperature despite not wearing any clothing. He entered the opening and saw people streaming into an even larger chamber from various doors in all directions. At the center of the room were two ramps going to a second and third floor. A older man stood between the ramps. Giving orders.

“Girls head up the left ramp, guys up the right”.

Ryan headed towards the man. Now able to speak he asked him.  

“Who are you? Where am I?” 

“I know less than you do, please just head up the ramp, I’m just trying to create some order.”

Hearing him speak, Ryan realized he knew who this man was. He was his journalism professor, sans his usual twenty-five year old grey suit making him almost unrecognizable.

“Professor Harper?” 

“Hello Mr. Stein. Please go up the ramp”.

Townsend “Boo” Radley IV sat in his small stock broker’s office with one of his bigger whales as they were called in the trade. A fish on the line. A sucker. A patsy.
Marvin Sfortz. Seventy-two years old. Sold a plastics extrusion factory in Belleville, New Jersey for twenty-six million and retired to a southern university town with a major teaching hospital and ACC basketball. Didn’t know what to do with himself now that he wasn’t bossing a pack of Puerto Ricans every day. Liked to imagine he could pick stocks. Had a nose for hidden value. Explosive growth.
“Well, down here with the grits and ya-hoos,” said Boo, “nobody much likes the action.”
“Bunch’a yokels,” Marvin echoed. “How did they fight the Civil War?”
Boo made a forced laugh. “It’s good to see a man who can take the torque of a roller-coaster ride on the market.”
“No guts, no glory,” croaked Marvin.
Sleazy old yuck with his dentures and foul cigar breath. It was just too funny to churn his account, make commissions on pointless trades. The man was in pre-Alzheimers and had no short-term memory retention. Couldn’t figure out he was losing money until tax time. And by then he had forgotten how all the transactions had worked.
The Yankees got drawn south by the low taxes. They all said it was the weather, but in fact their big government obsessions had ruined New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey. You hang on there, you’re just paying lavish retirements for a pack of parasite unionized civil servants.
So they flock south to a university town with “culture” not that you noticed it much. A teaching hospital to keep your sorry carcass upright. Buy up all the nice real estate and drive the penurious faculty out of the town.  Retired, nothing to do but carp with each other about how dumb the hicks are, how things were done so much better back where they came from.
Boo didn’t feel bad about what he was doing. He was young and needed to make his way in the world. Marvin had no use for the money. Just leave it to adult children that he constantly bitched about. Ingrates. Free-loaders. Moochers.
Marvin struggled to his feet, his brain already devoid of the trades the two had just agreed upon. Slapped a broad straw hat on his head like an Impressionist would use painting in the open air. Cataract glasses. He had one of those Medicare metal canes that you can adjust the height on. Couldn’t even carry a stylish cane carved from exotic wood. What good did 26-mil do him? Better it belong to Boo.
Boo had been the bottom of his prep school class and couldn’t get into the Ivies. One admissions director had actually laughed at him. Asked what “diversity” he would bring to the student body. “Old money wastrel? The vanishing New England WASP?” What a shit-head.
So he had come to the university along with the rest of the bottom of his class. Administrative fools actually fawned on them, believed they brought style to the place. Branded the school a “Southern Ivy.” Branding was big at colleges. What a joke.
Boo had been a lacrosse star. Had a mop of blond hair he could flip out of his eyes, wow the coed honeys. They all thought since he was from Greenwich he was rich. 
Problem was, there was no Townsend family money. Or very little of it. During his college years, he liked to swank around in his fraternity and pretend he was a trust-fund boy. But his father could barely pay the bills. And after he blew his brains out in the embezzlement scandal in his investment bank, there were no Wall Street connections either.
So Boo got his broker’s license and stayed on in town. His high-performing pals from his prep school class had all been Dartmouth and Yale; now they were at Goldman Sachs. Always talking big deals. Who the heavy hitters were.  The big swinging dicks.
He’d tell them he liked the low-key atmosphere of the South. Honey-voiced belles. Mint juleps. Said he was thinking of buying a race horse stud. They were working eighty-hour weeks and sounded envious. They had no idea what a ratty state it was. Dead textile mills. Feed-lot hog farms. Hillbillies in the mountains.
Boo played racquetball and squash now, liked to work out over at the medical school health center. Med classes were half women. Keep his eye peeled for hot young honeys in white coats with stethoscopes. He knew the income levels of the various specialties by heart. Interventional radiology was right up there at the top. Cardiology. 
He could picture himself married to one of them. Scale back his business and just manage her personal fortune. Take up fly fishing. They’d travel to New Zealand, Iceland, Chile. Make a regular thing of Christmas each year in Gstaad for the skiing.
A row of three dollar signs began blinking in the upper right of his computer screen.  Got him out of his reverie.
Good Christ, it had come in again. A cool million fucking dollars from a bank in Switzerland transferred once a year to Maeve McAlpin Fitzhugh jointly with her daughter Samantha. The sum was up to ten million now, and they never enquired about it, never withdrew any. They never fucking touched it. 
And it just sat there in an account that paid maybe two-percent. He always got a home office congratulations letter on his mismanagement of that one. The New York office got to play with the money and pay the Fitzhughs peanuts for the use of it.
He had only met them one time when the total was six million. Maeve Fitzhugh had seemed bored by the whole thing. Totally disinterested. Kept checking phone messages.
He pulled up the photos of mother and daughter. The firm always kept pictures in case of identify issues. The mother was what his mother in Greenwich would call a “handsome woman.” Mid-forties. Clean face lines. Hair pulled back. Very outdoorsy. Wind-burned complexion. Did some kind of exploration thing.
The girl was just a junior in high school. But there was something compelling about her. Her eyes just pulled you in.
He’d sit and stare at her for long periods of time.

We headed down through a yellow field of tall grasses.  Its slope converged at the center like a valley, here, high among the San Francisco foothills.  The Western sun shone gently upon our earnest escapades.  I wanted our adventures to embody the spirit of this city, a mystical bastion of all freedoms.

The field's ending was demarcated by a sort of incomplete fence, probably put there decades ago by the Spanish or the young American imperialists.  We stumbled to the gate, which hung open perfectly and allowed the cool ocean breeze to pass through like a gust of its own breath.  Matt was waiting on the other side.  He was a year older and wiser, well acquainted with the ways of the city's center.  He'd told us stories about all of the nooks and strange neighborhoods, the nudists and the secret passageways and the unique chill you could feel when you ate ice cream on the beach near the Golden Gate Bridge.

Matt was just the person I wanted to see.  Though I knew it would disappoint my brother, my goal would be aided by this traveler's expertise with the city's heartbeat.  I bid my time as we made our way through the less fertile crags of the hills, full of rocks, mosses, and bird droppings.

We overcame the precipice, and I could see a large numbers of graves in the direction we were heading in.  As we approached, I heard a slight buzz.  Matt groaned and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket.

“I have to get home for dinner, guys.  Sorry.  Maybe tomorrow.”

*Damn*, I thought.  I consoled myself with the knowledge that I couldn't have asked him now, anyway.  I could still enjoy this exploration- what appeared to be an antique cemetery, alone with my similarly-minded brother.  We stepped up, upon the artificially elevated ground of the yard, and looked around.  The rows went on for what seemed like forever.  I noticed a huge chamber near the center, which had to be a tomb for someone important.  As I went along, I observed the dates on the graves.  I was surprised at the age: they were almost exclusively from the mid-to-late 1700s, and the few exceptions were only slightly newer.  One must have been a young boy: his date of death was just before his eighth birthday.  Some had flowery patterns carved into the sides, and there were the customary cherubic angels tending to the invisible gardens growing atop the headstones.

I reached the massive tomb.  The faded brown doors exuded an antiquated feeling, and I could see that the stony sides were cracking.  Looking around and discovering no unwanted observers, I drew closer.  I saw notes and small trinkets scattered upon the small floor in front of the entrance.  Upon further inspection, the door was missing one of its bolts.  This rendered it almost imperceptibly ajar, but the opening was there.  I cautiously took another step forward and heard a crunch under my foot.  Curious, I leaned down and picked up the note.

The handwriting was scrawled hurriedly, and I could barely make it out on the piece of paper that was shredded at all corners.  After a little scrutiny, I picked out the strange message:

“NOT ME AGAIN”

I dropped it and ran blindly from the tomb.  My eyes scanned the graveyard and I realized that I didn't know where my brother was.  I tripped and fell, and collected myself against General Juan Pablo de la Trinidad's epitaph.  Slowly, I was able to calm myself, and rationalized it by acknowledging the likelihood of bored vandals.

My brother came trudging up from the left.  “A lot of old graves,” he quipped.

I brushed off my jeans, embarrassed at my former fright.   The sun now hung just a nickel's width above the Pacific, and I reminded my brother that we should head back.  I hadn't talked to Matt or seen the cool parts of the city, but I had tomorrow.  I still had to visit Fortunata, and who knew what she might show me?",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1gyetz,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gyetz/the_old_cemetery/,

The word summer doesn't necessarily make me think of the season, but of many fond memories growing up. I've always considered myself a lucky person although some who know me may disagree. The difference between their opinion and mine is that mine counts.

The first memory that grabs me took place in primary school, grade six. I think of that time in my life where the world suddenly got a whole lot bigger and complicated, which is amusing really because looking back on it at twenty-six I was only feeling a fraction of what that even meant.

I was dressed for school and left the house on my bike to stop by at my best friends house who lived around the corner from me. I remember being let in and I sat down in the kitchen, waiting for Jasmine who hadn't even dressed yet. Was I surprised? Not really. She was the kind of girl who was always late.

""Ready?"" I asked her when she came in.

She headed straight for the fridge. ""I haven't eaten.""

That, to me, was obvious. She always got super grumpy when she was hungry. I got up to help her put something together to save some time. We eventually left with five minutes to get to school. To be honest, I started to panic because there was no way we'd make it in time and I didn't want to be told off. The details of who talked who into just skipping school altogether isn't clear in my memory. What I can tell you is we were both capable of fitting that role so what did it matter? The last thing I remember is both of us turning our bikes around on tiptoe and heading for the bike track that ran along the end of the street.

The funny thing about memories are visual details aren't always clear, but I do remember certain feelings, even smells when I think about that day. There was a certain tree that used to grow everywhere with millions of tiny, vibrant yellow cotton balls on them and it gave off a smell of hay. I remember them well because the blossoms would stick to you like glue, in your hair and on your clothes. The trail we took led us to ride under a dozen of them, I even braved riding straight into some of its branches and probably came out wearing more blossoms than clothes.

There was a place we liked to go to at that age (I want to say I was twelve). The bike track is really nice, and still is to this day. The paths are lined with tree's on one side and follows a creek on the other. You always had the wind and sound of water to listen to. There was a certain tree we were drawn to; it took us about thirty minutes on bike. Believe it or not, a bunch of us picked this tree to practice magic. Why? Because it had a groove at it's base where you can light candles in. Which isn't the smartest idea but truthfully the thought of possibly setting the bike track on fire never crossed my mind. All this witchcraft business started from the movie, The Craft. Jasmine and I were past the idea of being witches by that stage but we continued to visit the tree for the nostalgia.

There was a branch on this tree that stood above the creek and was the perfect place to eat lunch. I carefully climbed up the trunk to the branch and began to crawl the rest of the way across like a frog; arms and legs clinging to the width of it and stopped when I was perfectly centre of the water flow below.

I really wish I could remember exactly what happened next, that had me hanging on for dear life. I want to say that I slipped under with enough force that my legs lost grip and just my hands held me above water. In reality, it might've been a three meter drop, but when you're small it feels like the length of a ravine.

Have you ever had a dream where you're falling, and this is it? You reached the glorious age of pick-a-number, next chapter please? I was feeling all those things. Not to sound like a drama-queen, but I believed I was going to die that day. I was crying out to be saved; I wish it was video taped and shown to actors/actress' of how desperation is meant to look. I would've won all the movie awards.

""Sandy, grab my hand,"" Jasmine said, sounding firm and in control. I doubt that's actually how she felt but I don't remember any dramatic facial expressions, she just appeared collected about the situation.

I managed to grab her hand, and then when we got the next opportunity, I held both of her hands. That's when I noticed her struggling to hold my weight, let alone pull me up. And that's when I realised she was going to let go before she even said anything.

""I don't want to die,"" I yelled at her. What now seems like such a corny line in the movies, something you just cringe at and say 'really?'... couldn't think of anything better to say? Honest truth? Nope. I really couldn't think of anything else but that I didn't want to not exist.

At this point, she was tearing up. ""I'm sorry, Sandy."" And let go. I'm not talking about I slipped out of her hands either. She released her grip and I fell.

I was possibly about to overdose on naturally produced adrenaline and endorphins that I did not even feel the impact, even though I landed on my arse.

I was no longer crying. I might have stopped the second my friend let go. I just sat there in the middle of the shallow creek (you heard me, I said shallow), letting the cold water rush over my legs and my submerged hands. Utterly shocked and completely void of thought.

Eventually I had enough sense to pull myself up and slush my way to the bank, where there were some well placed rocks I had to climb over. I looked up at my friend who had already climbed down and was waiting for me. I don't think we said anything to each other, if we did I don't remember what we said. All I knew is I was cold and wet and wanted to go home.

We walked with our bikes instinctively towards home, even though going home wasn't an option. We were meant to be in school, but I was stubborn and crying again. I refused to stay in my wet school uniform.

On the way, Jasmine might've apologised for letting go of my hands but I had mixed feelings about it at the time. Apart of me was angry she let go, but I was also angry at myself for saying 'I don't want to die'. I knew even as a kid, I put a seed of guilt on her. If I had seriously injured myself or died, I would've left her with those words and memory that it was her fault. And that is something valuable I learnt. To this day, I always think about how words can impact other people.

When common sense re-entered my brain (and at this point I'd stopped crying), I noticed some people on the same trail as us walking the opposite way would stare at us strangely. I realised even before my friend spoke that we were in school uniform which wasn't smart.

""Shit,"" Jasmine said.

I looked at her. ""What?""

Jasmine glanced over her shoulder again at the two women who had just past us. ""That was Renee's mum.""

""Really? Oh well.""

""You don't understand, she'll dob on us for sure. She's like that. If my mum finds out I missed school, she'll kill me.""

That surprised me. How'd she know that a friend of hers mum would tell the school we were not at home. I couldn't comprehend such a nosey person.

""She probably won't, you know. Worst comes to worst, she'll tell Renee not to hang around us anymore."" I didn't like Renee anyway. ""Trust me.""


We crossed an old wooden bridge. Right across from it, the bike track connected back to my street.

""Don't,"" Jasmine was saying. ""If you go home, you'll get busted. What am I supposed to do if you get busted?"" She was referring to the spare time we had left until school was over.

""I won't get busted. Trust me. I'm just going to take a quick shower, change clothes and come back. Just wait around here for me.""

""Your brother and sister are home, and that guy, remember?"" she reminded me, doubtful I would make it back.

""I'll be fine.""

Let me just say that all her points were valid and that I wasn't willing to see reason whilst I was still soaking wet. I left my bike with her.


You'll be amazed to know, that I came in through the front door, had a shower, changed, sneaked into the kitchen to grab an apple whilst someone was in the pantry, and left without getting caught. I have no idea how, but I did.

I noticed my sister's rollerblades on the front porch as I left the house and continued down the street where I left my friend. From a distance, she was riding around in circles idly. When she noticed me, she rode to meet me but by then my sudden urge to go back for the roller blades was cemented and I just had to go back for them.

I really annoyed my friend by going back, maybe because she was amazed I actually came back and this time, I definitely would not be.

I felt a surge of invincibility, a real ninja. I was approaching the finish line (the line being my friend) in rollerblades; in style. Which is laughable because I was no good at rollerblading then and I'm not now. I could not glide. It looked like I was taking tiny steps in boots twice the size of my feet. Think of Sideshow Bob from the Simpsons and that might paint a better picture. But I was grinning from ear to ear at my friend, cause I'd come back undetected and feeling smug.

That was when I heard my name. And I knew that voice. And I turned around. And I waved back at my sister like it was nothing... Damn. Let me just say that, even though they were my sister's rollerblades, she never used them! And today, of all days, she suddenly does. Funny how that happens.

My sister met us at the end of the street, amused that she'd caught us... in fact, apparently everyone at the house felt my presence, hadn't exactly seen me but I had left trails. I was relieved to have her laugh about it all instead of yell.

My sister convinced us to go back to the house but Jasmine and I were met with a different reception. My brother was waiting out the front and the first thing he did was yell and say how stupid we were. That's my brother for you... But what I wasn't expecting was how the adult in the house would react. His name was Fred, he was a friend of my parents and was there working on the kitchen renovations. He gave us a huge lecture and sent us back to school.


Strange how we've come full circle. This morning we were worried about being late to school. And now we're worried about being late to school... We were back where we started. Fred was sending us to our graves. But I had an idea.

""It's almost 3,"" I said to my friend. ""What's the point in going back and giving ourselves away? Fred will never know if we went back or not, we just have to pretend we did. Besides, I need to stick around to pick up my brother.""

""Bobby?""

""Yeah."" My younger brother Bobby and I always went home together. There was an alleyway that began at the end of one street and cut across to the highway; directly across from that was the school. ""Let's just wait in the alleyway until the bell rings and wait at the school gates for him."" My friend smiled at me. You don't need to tell me, I know I'm a genius.

We approached the end of the alleyway when we heard the intercom of the school come on and make some announcement. ""Would Sandy Morrison and Jasmine Lee come to the school office, please."" And repeated.

I stared at my friend. ""What the hell? How did they know? Do you think Fred rang them to make sure we actually went in? What a douche bag!""

Jasmine shrugged with a sigh. ""My parents are going to freak.""

We were utterly defeated and had no choice but to give ourselves up. We crossed the road and went to the school office, where to our surprise Renee's mum was standing there expectantly.
I liked Fred a little more that day and Renee's mum a little less. You can guess how the rest of my day ended.

A vast emptiness lay spread out before him. An infinite amount of space to be found and recorded. The cartographer glanced lazily at the ship’s console. The console was a complicated looking collection of screens, dials, buttons, joysticks and lights. To an ordinary person merely looking at the console would be enough to give him a week long headache. To the cartographer the console was simply a part of his life, as was the boundless swirling space through which he traveled. The brilliance of the stars and the awe-inspiring shooting stars did not faze the cartographer. To think that he had once wanted this job! This demanding job which required endless hours to be spent sitting in the cockpit, steering the ship and recording the cultures of each planet day after day, year after year. After the establishment of the Federation, world peace was achieved on Earth. The Federation decided to create a map of the vast and infinite space, to record what was there in the seemingly empty void. At the same time, it was realized that for all the humans on other planets a different culture may have evolved. A culture different from Earth’s, with food which can’t be tasted on earth, languages and traditions completely alien to those seen on earth. To record all this information, cartographers of space were born. Each cartographer would travel around space in a ship which would automatically map the space around itself. The cartographers were equipped which special devices which functioned as cameras, which could also record textures, smells and tastes. They also had a microphone which allowed them to speak and understand what was being said, even in alien languages. This functioned by scanning and comparing speech patterns across all of earth’s languages, which was enabled by connecting to a database using ethereal waves, a very high speed beam of information containing highly energized particles. The cartographer’s ships worked in the same way and allowed the cartographers to sync their maps and information to form one giant map of the universe. Many young people signed up to travel around the universe and enjoy the sights. 
However, this cartographer was tired of it all. He no longer wanted to try new food, or to see new things. He was free to go anywhere in the whole universe, and yet there was nowhere he wanted to go. He couldn’t even resign and go home. After all, how could he return to an ordinary life after has witnessed the extraordinary? To the cartographer space was not a mysterious and inviting world. It wasn’t an exotic ocean with something new to be seen at each and every turn. It was simply a vast collection of repetitive patterns, and infinitely iterated fractal, an art exhibition containing the same painting over and over again, with only a different use of color to differentiate between each painting. Suddenly the sharp voice of the ship’s navigation system cut through the lamenting thoughts of the cartographer.
“Sir, we are approaching a high energy field. The space around it appears warped. What are your instructions?”
The cartographer thought deeply. What would he have to lose? What would he stand to gain? Would the warp field be a harmless fluctuation in space? Or was it something grander? Perhaps it was sign of the end of the world, or maybe even the edge of space and time itself. The cartographer decided that any excitement would be worth it, even if it meant risking his life. After so many days of boredom, the cartographer was looking for any chance to escape his routine life.
“Proceed straight ahead”
Commanded the cartographer. 
The ship headed directly for the center of the fluctuation. The cartographer moved forward in his seat, he had a feeling that things were about to become interesting. 
A bright light exploded out from the center of the warped field. Time and space began to unravel around the cartographer as he watched the dazzling fireworks. The cartographer felt a strange feeling as if he was able to view the universe in its entirety spread out before him. He watched the brilliant stars float beyond him, and a myriad variety of planets whizz past. The cartographer looked down and realized that his ship was no longer around him, his clothes no longer on him and that he was floating through the depths of space unaided. The cartographer suddenly felt a jolt, as if he had been hit by a tremendous force. He was then unconscious.
When he came to, the cartographer lay in an empty white room that contained a humungous sign with a silver lining. In the center of the sign there were brilliant letters shone which read, “WELCOME TO THE OUTSIDE”. As he read and examined the sign, a man wearing a brightly colored robe entered the room. The cartographer looked at the man, aware of his own expression of confusion. He thought he had seen everything in the galaxy, but this was new to him. The man smiled at the cartographer. 
“Welcome to the outside of the universe.”
“The outside?” Asked the cartographer.
“Yes. However you’ll find that there isn’t much difference from the outside and the inside. With one exception.”
The cartographer felt a sudden sting of dismay. He was hoping for something which would defy the confines of the knowledge he owned. He was seeking something beyond the ordinary, something which was unprecedented, something unseen. He hoped that at least the exception mentioned would be of some interest to him.
“An exception?”
“Yes, here on the outside, we have the ability to simulate universes, to create an infinitely vast space and then define the physical rules of the said space. In order to solve problems of overpopulation we have sent the excess of our people to these simulations. This is the outside, all of the simulations are the various insides. Currently we have 1,485,295 simulated worlds active. However, we sent those people to the simulated worlds long ago, and they seemed to have blended in with the indigenous species in each universe. Now, the people of the outside wish to have greater understanding of our own simulations. They wish to obtain knowledge about the various cultures present. It has come to my attention that you were hired to create a map of your world. I request you to aid in creation of map of all the worlds.”
“Are you trying to say, you want me to explore a large number of universes each with an infinite amount and catalogue every of each of these universes in order to create this map? That would take all of eternity.”
“No, no. There are already people who have begun cataloguing some of the other worlds. Besides, you don’t need to travel through the entire universe, after how much variation can any species produce? Anyways, all the data collected by each one of the data collectors is transferred back to us via high energy particle transmissions.”
“Ethereal waves?”
“Yes, I do believe it was called so in your simulation.”
The cartographer was reminded of the day he first became a cartographer brimming with excitement of the prospect of travelling the universe. Now he would get to see an infinite amount of infinite variation. The cartographer let out a satisfied sigh.  There was much to explore, and much to be seen.

And it isn’t you. I’ve been living in a fantasy, that’s the problem, a fantasy of you and me. I keep thinking that one day you’ll wake up and see me waiting here for you and everything will be like it’s supposed to. You’ll say hi and I’ll say hi and you’ll run your hand through your hair and the spikes will flip back up and I’ll laugh cause it’s cute and you’ll tell me I have a nice smile cause you like the way I squint and my freckles squish around my eyes.

I have to shake that out of my head. So it’s me. It’s my problem.


I can’t forget that time we stayed on the phone till two in the morning, just talking, and the way you laughed at my crappy jokes. That was wonderful. I won’t forget that. I was the most in love with you in those moments. Those were the moments you could have asked me to do anything for you and I would have said yes without hesitation. I was too afraid to tell you this before, but you left me breathless. I should have told you sooner. I guess I’m telling you now, though, and that must count for something. But I can’t help but feel like it’s too late. It’s so hard to find that place between too soon and too late. I’m not sure it exists, really, if there’s a right time to say I love you. I haven’t found it anyway. I know this is terrible timing but I have to tell you that I love you.


But I have to stop thinking about it, because it won’t bring you to me. So I’m going to try to forget how it felt when you smiled at me and how it felt when we spoke in unison. I have to move on, even if it’s without you, even if it hurts. I have to move on.


I’m sorry I’m telling you all this, but I feel like I should explain myself. I need to tell you why I can’t see you anymore. We’ll meet again someday, I’m sure, but at least for now I need to let you go. I don’t know if I can forgive myself for letting you go, but I have to try to live my own life. I hope you can forgive me.


I love you, but it’s not enough. Sometimes love doesn’t conquer. Sometimes it dies. And I’m going to let it, because we can’t save it. I can’t save it. So I’m going to let them unplug you now. They said you’ll stop breathing and your heart will stop beating and it will be slow, but you won’t feel a thing. I’m glad. I wonder if you can even feel this right now. If you can feel me leaving you. Well, in case you can, here’s the ring. I can’t keep it. Not if I’m going to keep going. Not if I’m going to live.


I’ve stayed with you through everything—rich and poor, sickness and health—but I can’t watch you die. I’m not going to stay, so this is goodbye. See you later, love.

A witch makes a bet with a young Tiny.

He must go into the cave and retrieve the diamond of youth. If he wins, she will give him eternal youth. However, at some point he will encounter the horrible cave wizard, and he must slay it or it will kill him.

So the Tiny agrees to the bet.

He wonders into the cave, leaving breadcrumbs as his trail. He finds it is a long and windy cave.

When he gets to the end of the cave, his torchlight reveals the diamond of youth... grasped in the arms of a skeleton. He looks high and low for the cave lizard and sees none, so he grabs the diamond from its arms.

The witch says, ""You failed to slay the lizard!""

The days that are not scorched under the burning sun are usually sultry under the oppressive humidity of rain bearing clouds. When it rains, it does not rain in drops – like it should, but in sheets of impenetrable water. In the creeks and waterways lurk predators unchanged for eons. The dry land holds no reprieve as it is replete with venomous critters, unseen and unheard harbingers of death. It’s not surprising then, that it is but a wasteland for the peoples populating the more hospitable lands to the south. Neither is it surprising that this land is devoid of humanity.  It’s not that this land is without a strange, almost ancient, kind of beauty. However, it’s not, obviously, something that beckoned visitors or would-be residents with open arms.



This is why it was so weird that they had left their cozy homes and comfortable jobs in the anonymous suburbia to move here. Mat &amp; Sid’s parents had always romanticized this land. Their youth and naivety had misled them into a notion of freedom in the life off the land under this harsh sun. It would have been ironic, had it not been such a tragedy, that they had far too soon lost their lives to this unforgiving land. The twins were at the tender age of five or thereabouts.


It was a matter of tremendous luck then, that in such a tenuously populated area the twins had found a caretaker. Bigg was a recluse, probably a felon and most definitely a maniac with delusions of grandeur. In his mind, he was the king of this realm. No animal could harm him. The shining bright sun that made tinder out of living trees was powerless to make him sweat and the venomous critters were but vermin to be squashed underneath his bare feet. But that is what made him special and especially suitable to live off this land. He was fearless in the face of danger which lurked paralyzingly close. This, in turn, made him able to fetch food, water and shelter at will.


It didn’t come as surprise to Mat that they had a very unusual childhood. They didn’t learn about the world or math or culture, no, they learnt about the greatness of Bigg. They learnt how he could bend the land to his will. When not learning how else to exalt Bigg, they learnt to kill animals that could kill them and eat the rest. They also learnt to stalk and hunt, to grovel and beg before Bigg for more ideas and when all else failed, to steal – from each other, from other, more formidable, critters. Mat never liked this life and yearned to escape. It’s not that he was ever prevented from escaping, it’s just that he knew, even as a child, separation from Bigg meant death in this unyielding landscape and that tormented him. Sid, on the other hand, while never deriving sadistic pleasure out of any of this, was, for the lack of a better word, content. This annoyed Mat, it did as child and it did now.


Despite all his vagaries, Bigg was a father figure for the twins. He valued the stories of their exploits in the land more than the spoils. He had, for instance, no interest in the meat that took a great deal of effort on the part of twins to hunt, but he had great interest in their story of the hunt, and the fact that they did it. While he enjoyed some of the fruits of his own toils, he never grew attached to them, neither did he place a great deal of value in things the twins had obtained at great effort. He was too attached to himself, perhaps. This was another thing that Mat never understood; to him, something that took effort to procure was valuable, it’d even more valuable if others valued it too, of course, but they didn’t. Mat would often remind himself that Bigg was a maniac, that would explain everything. But what annoyed Mat was the fact that Sid would nonchalantly let their spoils go to waste were Mat not to take notice.


When the twins were not much more than fifteen, they were “discovered” by some hardy travelers passing through. Child protection services had put them up in a care center and eventually a foster home. The date they were brought to the foster home was celebrated as their birthday ever since. Mat loved his brother, and he was sure Sid loved him back, in as much as  he could be said to love anything. But they had increasingly grown distant despite their physical proximity. Mat remembered their first “birthday” in the foster home vividly. They had a hastily baked strawberry shortcake presented to them by their foster family. Sid’s advice was “Mat, enjoy the cake, really taste every bit of it and enjoy it when it’s available. But don’t get addicted to it, don’t remember it and yearn for it. Expectation only brings misery.” This and other such strange things is what made Mat grow tired of his brother.


Initially, they were ill adjusted to the life in the City. They were, after all, feral children – they didn’t belong in civilization. Their history notwithstanding, Mat did remarkably well at school. Sid seem disinterested in what civilization had to teach them. Mat even went to a prestigious college. In college fell in love with a girl and they got married by the time he was in his early twenties. Post education, he took up a job, not much different, perhaps, from his parents’ anonymous vocation. Mat and his wife lived in a suburb, had a pet dog for company and generally led a life that society had taught them would bring happiness, or at least this is how they were to pursue that elusive emotion. In all the years since Mat went off to college, however, he had hardly met Sid. Sid had come to Mat’s wedding, but that was about all they had seen of each other during all these years. Their foster family was not much close to them, for they were rebellious, not to mention feral, teenagers when they were brought there and by the time they could appreciate what that family had done for them it had grown dysfunctional.


Last year, however, Sid had called on Mat to meet him. It startled Mat, for, in all these years he couldn’t remember a single instance where Sid had asked him for anything, not even to meet him! The conversation they had then was exceedingly strange to Mat, even by the standards of his conversations with Sid. Mat recalled the conversation in his mind.


“How have you been, my brother?”
“I’m alright Sid. In fact I don’t think I’ve ever been happier. What are you doing these days?”
“Oh, it’s not much, I just bring people to our land and show them its beauty. Can you believe they pay me to do that? They pay me good money – just to show them something that could harm them!”
“I’m glad to hear that, are you happy?”
“I’m content, brother. I heard you bought a house?”
“Yes, Bigg would’ve been proud!”
“Indeed, say, do you ever wonder… never mind…”
“What is it?”
“It’s just that, do you ever wonder… you were so distraught at our parents’ sudden demise and so suddenly we find Bigg… or that he never provided us with anything, nothing physical, just… comfort… or that the social services never found anyone else where we lived…?”
“Well, it was providential that we found him. I don’t find it hard to believe that no one found him, remember he was a master of disguise and he’d lived off the land for god knows how long.”
“Yes, never mind. The reason I called, my… err… business is doing rather well… too well in fact. But I don’t want it. I want you to have it”
“What? I have my job here, my life here, I don’t want to go back to the land”
“You don’t have to, if you don’t want to. You can sell it. I have other people who guide people in the land as well, you could just manage it”
“Are you serious?!”
“Yes. Here are the papers.”
“And… what.. what will you do?”
“Oh, I’m off to explore places, experiences and the world…”
“You know you are giving up lots of things. You can have a good life here, a family perhaps… You can be happy!”
“Ah, but that’s not what I’m after!”
“What ARE you after?”
“Well… nothing”
“You are crazy”
“So are you, my brother”


It turned out that Sid’s business was worth millions. Mat would’ve been a fool to not keep it. It annoyed him that Sid didn’t want to be happy, it annoyed him that he had to be back in the land he detested. But it meant money. So he was back, he was guiding a few folks in the area, showing them the ropes of surviving the land. He thought to himself “this is a strange land”…

It's comforting to me. It's familiar. But it doesn't help me any. I stop using sandwich baggies and start to use baby food jars instead. For some reason that I can't explain to myself, it's all that I've been eating: baby food. Maybe it's because it's easy on my stomach. Maybe it's because the jars are cute. Maybe it's because cute things remind me of her. Maybe it's because I keep thinking that she'd be the mother of my kids. Maybe it's because I was mourning our non-existent family. I don't really know.

It's been a three weeks since we had broken up and I started eating baby food so now I have several dozens of these jars lying around my apartment. When I had first put my sleep in them, I didn't bother washing them out. I figured that my sleep would benefit from having a little ""mashed-peas"" flavoring to them, or maybe a little hint of ""mashed bananas and strawberries."" Clearly, clarity of thought wasn't my strong suit at this point. Doesn't sleep with a hint of kiwi sound good? Six to Eight hours of restful sleep, now in tropical flavors.

We were supposed to go on a tropical vacation together. If not, maybe just up to Vancouver. I've never been there before, but she told me that it was a real clean city. ""It'll be so much fun!"" she said. I believed her too. Still do. But I can't do that now and I think I hate Vancouver. It doesn't matter anyway. I have my sleep to pack. So much sleep to pack. What's worse is that the dream penguins are starting to become permanent. Well, at least one anyway. I've named him Bear and he's been following me for the last two days. The weird thing is that he listens to me and can actually fetch me things.

""Can you bring me that bag over there, Bear?""I ask.

He looks around and somehow I know that he doesn't see any.

""We've ran out?""

Bear nods.

""Hmm.. "" I say.

But I see Bear shuffle around and walk into my room. I hear some ruckus and then he's back bringing me a baby-food jar.

""For my sleep?""

Bear doesn't even need to nod. Our thoughts, they're one.

I notice that he's cleaned out the jar. I don't know how how's managed to do it, but I take it in my hand and hold it up to the light. It's very clean. I wonder if it smells so I bring it up to my nose and, to my surprise, find that it has a very pleasing scent. A sort of airy, sunny-day type scent.

""How'd you-"" I start, but the look he gives me tells me to stop.

""Ok, that's fine.""

I imagine that I've somehow deluded myself into believing that Bear really exists and that I actually cleaned the jar out by myself, but I'm so tired that I don't give it anymore thought than that and accept Bear is real. Bear is my only friend. 

I have two boxes of sleep saved up. Because the baby food jars are smaller than the sandwich baggies, I only manage to fit in about 4 maybe for hours worth. I haven't really figured out how to measure my sleep yet, so I'm guessing at the amount. I'm assuming that because I'm managing only to fit half as much sleep into the jars that the amount of rest would be half. Half is an approximation as well because  sometimes I have extra left over and sometimes I'm unable to fill two jars with one night of sleep. 

God, I'm tired. 

Bear nudges me. 

Right, Right. 

I have to fill this jar. 
I have to fill this jar.

   Her best friend, Macy, was texting her the usual amusing conversations that arose between them.

   Her younger sister laid in her bed, probably asleep, but Annabelle had no way of knowing for sure.

   Her parents were in their bedroom, watching TV. Annabelle was alone.

   The air conditioning was on; it had been a hot day. Annabelle pulled the comforter up around her and shot her friend a quick text; she hadn't responded in a while. Annabelle was alone emotionally.

   Music drifted through Annabelle's head, a symphany of symphanies. She could almost feel the pull of her alto saxophone strap on her neck and the smooth metal keys under her fingers.

   Annabelle yawned, it had been a dull day. A dull day stacked upon dull days. Summer stretched on forever, with no end in sight.

   Annabelle glanced around her room. Hanging on her white walls were pictures and drawings and letters and posters. Some of it had been given to her by her friends and family, and some she had made herself. Someday she was going to run out of space, but for now the cluttered wall made Annabelle feel at home in her small room.

   Closing her eyes for a second, Annabelle imagined how her life could be different. It could be worse- seperated parents, no house, no food, no money. But it could also be better: more friends. No matter how many or how good, Annabelle never felt like it was enough. She didn't necessarily want to be *popular*, but she wanted people from all different groups to like her for who she was.

   A lot of times Annabelle felt like her intelligence created a barrier between her and other people. People would hear about her grades or her ""good girl"" aura before they actually talked to her. She didn't really have any proof, but it was Annabelle's best guess.

   Annabelle was shy, but only sometimes. As much as Annabelle tried not to fit into a stereotype, she sometimes held herself to it. She would dance in math class with Macy to music inside her head, but when there was an oportunity to dance on camera in band, she was one of only 5 people who refused.

   Annabelle wasn't sure if she was pretty or not. Sometimes, she looked in the mirror and really felt good about herself. But othertimes, sometimes later in the day or in a different light, Annabelle thought she was plain. She was pretty convinced this was the truth, and the way everyone saw her. Annabelle didn't think that anyone was beautiful, because to her that was someone with no flaws. Annabelle knew her definition of beautiful was wrong, but she knew she couldn't change it.

   Annabelle didn't know what it meant to be beautiful on the inside. A beautiful soul must be pink and rosy, but everyone had flaws, little black edges. Annabelle wasn't sure if black could be beautiful, or even if black wanted to be beautiful. Maybe black loved to be the other side of the coin.

   Love wasn't something Annabelle felt sure about, but I guess if we are being truthful, she wasn't sure about anything. She didn't know if love was possible at 13 or 14, or even 20. She didn't know what love was. Anyone can find a list of ""symptoms"" of love on the internet, but Annabelle didn't really believe any of it. Was true love even possible?

   Annabelle stared up at the ceiling fan and watched it spin. It had such a wonderfly boring life. It spun and spun, and when it was cold outside it was stopped. No independent thought or worries or obligations of any kind. It was a ceiling fan and no one expected it to be or do anything extrordinary. What a life.

                                                Truth or Dare Killer


 The jury stood in the trial room shuffling their papers, the judge in his seat and family and friends of the defendant waited in the pew-styled seating behind the chest high mahogany wall. The court scribe sat in the corner, fingers ready to type upon the computer with the artist already painting the image, occasionally wiping the hot summer sweat off his brow. A quick left-right glance, with head nods of approval, the judge called for proceedings.
“We will make this quick as possible, but by no means a fast trial, understand? I want no interruptions from the galley, should there be any, the security will deal with you.” The judge nodded to the jury.

 A posh white man stood up from the front corner of the jury’s seating. “The defendant, Sampson Tyrone Nettle, has been charged by the prosecutor, Jamie Ellete, representing the general public, for roughly eight counts of repeated killings and counting. The deaths of Jay M. Lee, Cynthia Jonnas, Lam Soo Youk, Tyler Goust, Mathew Zachary Kayne, Lee Engal,  Herth Peireson, and Olivia Kimptex, are so far the only victims found, after reports of serial murders across several provinces and states in the U.S. and Canada, all found with identical notes; one of which being ‘I dare you to keep as quiet as possible’ or ‘Tell me everything you know about me’, fastened to the victim’s hands, which are crossed over the face and kept in place by a blindfold. Recorded information from local and national police data state that all victims died with minimal struggling, and suffered death by electrocution via crude head attachments. There is no record for DNA on the victims, along with no criminal record for Sampson Nettle.” 

The jury announced, quietly sitting back down with pre-recorded information now settling in the air around them
“So, Sampson, how do you plead?” the judge asked.

“My client would like to plead not guilty.” Said Sampson’s lawyer, sitting beside him. Dressed in a brown suit with a white dress shirt accented by gold cuffs and black tie, he stood up from his seat. Brushing his neatly combed brown hair, and patting his cheeks, he quickly passed a look of ‘I got this’ towards Sampson, who was arrested, is bound to a dolly. Strapped down and mouth covered with a muzzle, already in an orange jumper from his night’s stay in a maximum security cell. He sweated, eyes moved franticly about, and his brown hair messy and unclean, he shook about. Security didn’t stand too far, or too close to Sampson. 

“My client, Sampson Nettle, is currently employed at Havard-Jason Law Firm. A respectable operation for respectable men and women like yourself, your honor. Now with that in the air, why would a man, who spent money, time and endless effort to get a job in such a field, throw it away for a senseless killing spree? If you roll it in your head, it becomes clear, the two do not connect.” He took a step away from the booth into the middle of the room. “Now, you are charging a man with no criminal record to a crime that he did not commit? Truly my client has either been framed, or is under fraud.” He returned to his seat.

The judge leaned back in his seat. “Mmm, thank you... Mister...”

“Mr. Ruth. Timothy Darnell Ruth.” 

“Righty then. Alright, prosecutor. It is your turn.”

Standing from the opposing table, a pale woman with cuts on her face, blankly staring at the tabletop. She wore a black business suit, and a hair band. A pair of glasses sat on the table in front of her. Her lawyer stood up. 

“To make things clear, I am Gerald Baker; I’ll be representing Jamie, who is a co-worker with Mr. Nettle. According to a paper she was barely able to write, she recordings walking into a room at an office, in which Sampson was engaged in a game of truth or dare with several other party members. The game, as one would assume requires one to chose between a dare, or to answer a question that they are asked. Apparently, she was the last person, along with Sampson to play. She agreed in doing a dare, and Sampson requested she enter a dark storage closet alone. There, she was trapped by a one-way door which the handle, popped off of on the inside. By this time, the party was over and most of the others have left. Sampson then, entered the closet, whispered something to her, and began to bind her to a chair. He then ‘Smashed the light bulb with his fist, and began to unstring the wire’. Fortunately, the Janitor was in the vicinity, and was able to protect Jamie, and detain Sampson in the closet before authorities could arrive on scene. Her story is backed up by several cuts and bruises. No prints were found; we assume Mr. Nettle was wearing gloves during the incident. At the current moment, the evidence is stacked against you. I rest my argument for the time being.”

Gerald sat back down beside Jamie, still shivering and uneasy. She passed a glance to Sampson, before whimpering and turning her head swiftly back towards the ground.

“Excellent,” the judge said with sarcasm. “Will the defendant’s lawyer retake his stand?”

“Yes your honor. I would like to call Jamie to the stand; provided she is able.” Timothy said passing a caring glance at Jamie. She stared, worried at her lawyer. Garald nodded. She got up and slowly made her way to the stand. As she sat, her eyes focused to the back of the room, trying to block out the sight of Sampson, who sat in the stand in front of her.

“Now Jamie,” Timothy said, beginning to pace the room like an actor. “Can you describe your attacker?”

Jamie’s lips trembled. “H-He was... maybe tall—wore a suit, but it was an office party... so 
no question to it... he had hair; it was too dark to see its colour—“ she went silent for a moment.

Suddenly, she stood up, slamming her hands on the table “It was that fucker! I know it! Just throw him in the cell! Just throw him in!” she pointed accusingly towards Sampson.
“Hmmm. Your honor, the witness is in no state to be testifying, I feel that the case should be postponed until she is more stable.”

“Nonsense.” The judge said. “You have evidence pressed by other lawyers and police officials.”

“Your honor, is suggest that we postpo—“

“Mr. Ruth. Sit down.”

“Sir I-“

“Sit.”

Timothy sat back down in the booth.
“Now, as we have heard. Information from the defense is lacking; indefinitely. The prosecutor has more information that is required to put this man to jail or more. The jury, I ask you enter the room to your right, and begin your final verdict. Sampson wailed and struggled violently in his restraints, 
“Wait,” Gerald spoke up. “Let Sampson speak. This man should at least say his words before we sentence him to anything. The judge nodded towards a security officer, who slowly unbuckled Simpson’s muzzle. As soon as it clicked, and clatter, falling off, Sampson screamed “It wasn’t ME! I’m framed! You all are insane!”

“Mr. Nettle. If you believe you are an innocent man, who would have done this to you?” Gerald asked.

“I- Don’t- KNOW! It wasn’t me! I swear!” he shook and moved erratically, eyes dilated. 

“That’s enough, silence him.” The judge said, gesturing towards a nearby officer.  As the officer came to strap the muzzle back on, Sampson wailed again
“No! No! Fuck you people! All of you are pigs- you’re all insane! You’re all going to hell for this! To he—mfmrmm!!”

“Listen to him, that man is crazy as hell!” A man from the galley yelled. “Execute this pig!” another barked.

With a quick bang of the gavel the court was quiet again. The judge looked down towards Sampson in pity. “The jury may continue to the room.”

Time passed slowly. The mid-day light turned to orange sunset, which turned to incandescent streetlights. Then jury returned, silent and solemn. The last member into the booth stood up.

“Have you reached a consensus?” the judge asked, letting out a yawn.

“Yes, your honor. Sampson Nettle has been voted, by all parties, to receive the death penalty.”

Sampson wailed again. The dolly fell over, and he fell and still; quietly whimpering behind his muzzle.

“Alright. Mr.Nettle. your death will be scheduled as soon as possible. May god have mercy on your soul.”

Sampson was escorted out of the hall. Ruth stood close to him, his hand on his shoulder. 
“I’m sorry Sampson. I did what I could with what information I had.” 

All Sampson did was weep quietly behind his muzzle...
*       			*			*			*			*



The next day, Sampson sat in an iron chair in a dingy prison execution room, buckled in. The ventilation was dusty, releasing musky air that only a man of death would care to ignore. Removed of his strappings, he sat quietly. Tears ran down his face, only to be seen by security and the families of the deceased. Timothy stood in the corner of the room, near the security officer near a lever. A priest came to Sampson, blessed him and offered Sampson a last confession. 

“...I didn’t do it...” Is all Sampson said. The priest nodded, marking the sign of the cross on him, and walked back into the galley and out the door. 

“Sampson Nettle. Your earthly judgement has come. Any final words?” the officer near the lever said. Sampson just shook his head.

“Actually, hold on. I have one more thing I’d like to say to my client in privacy.” Timothy said. The security nodded, and stood outside the door. Timothy walked to Sampson’s side.
“Thank you... Timothy, you tried to help me. But I guess this is it, huh?” Sampson mumbled.
“Yes. But I need to ask you something.” Timothy stated.

“Yeah. Shoot, can’t ask me questions when I’m dead.”

“Yeah, yeah... Well Sampson. I want to ask if you want to revisit a childhood of mine.”

“Well, how is that going to be done? I’m strapped to a chair.”

“Just answer a simple question. Truth. Or Dare?”

“...Truth- What the fuck are you going on about?”

“Just answer the question.”

“...Fucking dare; not like I’ll be able to do it.”

“I dare you to keep as quiet as possible.”

Sampson’s eyes widened...

“You mother fucker- you mother FUCKER!!” Sampson raised his body of the seat as far as he could, arms and legs still locked into the seat by iron cuffs.

“Security!”

The guards ran in and detained Sampson, strapping him further into the chair. He violently resisted, violently thrashing and trying to fight his way out of the seat.

“Fuck you! You slimy bastard—It was him! He killed all those people! That shit- Kill him!” Sampson pointed with his loose finger. Timothy looked empathetic, and turned away.

Sampson was strapped to a point where he could not move at all. That’s when security began to hook up the device. An officer walked off to the side where they kept the machine.

“Crap, a part of it is haywire. Does anyone have something metal?” an officer yelled from the storage.

An onlooker took out a bobby pin from her purse. A simple metal attachment.

“How the fuck did you do it—How! You son of a bitch—How! Tell me!!” Sampson yelled.

“That’ll do; we need to fix this stupid thing.” He took it from her and brought it back into the room. Then he wheeled it out. Old and worn, wires held together with duct tape, and the attachments in place with a metal cup, and the other a metal cup and bobby pin; an attachment for an electric chair.

“No- Fuck YOU! FUCK ALL OF YOU- YOU’RE MAKING A MISTAKE!” Sampson wailed as he moved his fingers and feet about, trying to break free.

Timothy left the room.

“Get back here!! Now! You son of a bitch! Back—Ge- Get him!”

“You will be silenced soon, Mr. Nettle. Please be calm, as we will make it as painless as possible.”

The dome of the old and degrading machine was placed over Sampson’s head, the pin and cup attached to his temples. The sound a clutch, and clatter. The room sparked and whizzed with light; the sound of the darkest noises man could create rang through the chamber. The null of summer was broken then silent again.

He laid there.  Time seemed to stop.  He looked into the sky, knowing it would be the last time he would.  He examined the thick, puffy clouds and their beauty.  They looked so soft.  So peaceful.  He saw the birds, flying in their formation.  They had no care in the world.  They were free.  He wished he was.  He wished that the beauty and peace of the clouds and the birds was his world.  Where there was evil and hatred.  He wanted to feel the love of his family one more time.  All he wanted was to be free.  Like the birds.  But he was there.  

    He was there where men killed each other.  Where men fought.  But he did realize that is was not for nothing,  It was for what was right.  Those men were evil, and he was there to stop them.  He did all he could, but then he was put there.

    He was there, on the ground, covered in his own blood and tears, looking at the natural beauty of the heavens while time stopped.  But then he saw his reality.  

    He knew that this was his end.  He knew it was time to go.  He was going to be with the birds and the clouds and his new world would be filled with peace and wonder.

This is my first post, and frankly, my first piece of writing (other than school) that I put a decent amount of time into. I'm just wondering what you guys think! Be honest, I want to improve. And yes, for the record, this is all true. EDIT: Sorry for my title being so similar to another post from a few hours earlier, I didn't even realize until after I posted!


The Midst of the Night 

    
   As one slowly fades to two, my mind runs a marathon. As with a marathon, it is both painful and rewarding; remembering what was, imagining what could have been. A bittersweet river of emotions that I wish would end, but know will run on. Why must you do this to me? 
The end is no fault of yours, really. Just fate. A cruel hand was dealt, and I had already pushed all my chips to the center. Did you? I long to know the answer, but also hope to never know. If you feel like I do, just show me a sign. Anything. But you won’t. Who’s to say you don’t have the same sleepless nights? You might. But my suspicion is you don’t. And knowing that for sure is a thousand times worse than not knowing. 
    
   I try to recreate the past- mostly arguments. Why couldn’t they have ended better? Either way, they mean little that isn’t why it’s over. They are just a painful remainder of a mostly happy time. I was always the bad guy, you never did any wrong, yet I always just agreed. I was blinded by love. Now that the rose colored glasses are gone, I realize that isn’t true. My feelings are equal to those of everyone else. 
    
   I create future conversations knowing all too well that they will never occur. Or if they do, not as well as in my head. I’m not as smooth a talker as I am a thinker, and while I know you well, you responses are unpredictable. 
    
   The rational majority of my mind knows this needs to happen, and better now than later. Yet the small romantic area still aches. Each day I try to convince myself it’s fine. It’s an argument I have trouble winning. Must you convince yourself? Or had you long ago conquered that small voice of anti-reason lurking through your consciousness? That’s another thing it might be better not to know. 

   Do you even care about me? Your words sound so, but your actions reek with apathy. If actions speak louder than words, your sentence of investment has been drowned out by the manifesto of disregard. I’m but an old newspaper: interesting at one time, now tossed in the corner, only to be glanced at occasionally. I pray that it is but a figment of my negative imagination. 
    
   I know in time, all this will fade just as two now fades to three. It will be a black and white scene in a long film of technicolor. I only wish it could fade sooner. But time is a merciless warden, imprisoning you in the present, only allowing you to leave when he sees fit. The mind is a complex thing. It almost enjoys the pain. I am far simpler, and I don’t.

""Okay, okay, I won't go into the rift, I promise Orna. I went to school, I know. Fuck.” 

Orna grunted in his breathing apparatus. 

“Five minutes max. You hear me?

""Capisce Doc!""

Kyle glided down into the kelp forest, just next to the rift, a gateway to the abyss.

*We are in kraken territory, Kyle. I hope you understand that.* 

Orna's flashlight flickered. His spine vibrated. 

The new diving suits issued by the company were tested a few days before this dive, and nothing more. Anything past the deadline meant closure, and they couldn't risk losing this client. *Archetypes are always flawed, bound to Murphy’s law. Focus.* 

""We have to dive today! They expect samples by next week!"" said his boss during this morning's phone call.

Orna tried to convince his boss it was mating season, and although rare in the wild, no dive team ever would compensate for the risks held by encountering one. Not even SEALs. 

""They don't even prey on humans Orna!"" *Money first I guess though.*

Countless dives under the ocean, this place was Orna's second home, a haven to him. He lost sight of Kyle in the kelp bed. The flashlight flickered again. 

*It won't happen to me.*

He recalled those memories. How his former master convulsed in front of him, lapsing into a state of undeniable, pure and utter delirium after her lights relinquished, finalizing her into a state similar to schizophrenia. 

He closed his eyes. He saw the shore, his wife, his daughters. He took a staccato-type-breathe. 

Orna's light finally died isolating him three-thousand fathoms under the ocean in complete darkness. *You got your test. Get us out of here now.*

""Kyle, my light just died. You have to abort. It's too dangerous."" he said over the radio. 

Orna heard a whisper in the distance, a deranged voice. A woman. 

""Kyle do you read me?"" He began to panic. 

Silence.

""Kyle!""

The voice became louder. 

The water displaced around him. Orna Piccardo recalled was this morning's call with his boss. *They don't even prey on humans.*

It was purple sometimes, usually in the mornings, but she didn't know this because she usually woke up around noon, when the flower was yellow. She would lie in bed with the flower hanging limply over her forehead and stare at it's oddly shaped figure. She would wonder if maybe it had come loose during the night, that maybe during her sleep she had some how slept in such a way as to damage it enough so that it would come off, but the flower was always okay, misshapen as it had always been. 

She would then lie in bed for an hour thinking about the same thoughts she usually thought, nothing particularly grand or special. Sometimes thinking that she must change and that today she is going to do something and work on her life. She thought all the thoughts on how to become a better person, how to become more ambitious. She knew exactly what she needed to do, she had thought about it all before, but soon, those thoughts would drift away and she would find her self masturbating for ten minutes before cumming in a mediocre splat of pleasure and continue lying in her bed. When she came, the flower would give off an aroma. It wasn't something offensive, but not pleasing either. It was neither this nor that; a ubiquitous scent that was a cross between warm sand and chives left on a kitchen counter. This is usually when she thought that she should brush her teeth. Another healthy and good thing that she knew that she should do, her hand wiping away her sploosh juice onto her panties, and continue to lie in bed. 

Eventually, she would get up from bed walk to her bathroom to pee with the door open. With her legs resting on the top of her ties, she would stare at the shadow her head flower made on the floor between her feet. When she farted, she could see the flower shiver. This made her smile. It's her fart flower. A flowering fart. Wipe. Flush. 

Looking at herself in the mirror, the flower would limp between the space of her left ear and eye. I have a limp penis on my head. A penis with petals. penis petals.

She had tried to pull the flower out when she noticed it growing. It had frightened her. This was not normal, to have flowers growing out of one's head. When it was very small, just budding, she had tugged at it and felt something pull at the center of her brain. She never knew she could feel her brain and it frightened her. She had tried to cut it, using a pair of kitchen knives, but the stem, as limp as it was, was actually quite strong. She had only managed to scratch it and saw that it created welts that spotted blood. Her blood. Her brain blood. This flower is from my brain.

I was sitting in the living room with my arms crossed when Grandpa gathered the family around the dining room table. Grandpa was a giant of a man, with thighs like redwoods and hands like plains. I was the last to stand up when I began to walk over to the circle that had formed around the table. “I would like to see,” Grandpa began, with big pauses between each phrase, “someone attempt to balance this egg upright, without using any tools to hold it up.”

The whiteness of the egg stood out in Grandpa’s wrinkled and purple spotted hands. It seemed so small. I studied the egg while my family began to buzz. My older cousin smirked and whispered something in my Dad’s ears that made him laugh. Uncle Joe was doing one of his James Cagney impressions to my brother and cousin. Aunt Anna had walked in the room from cooking and chuckled when she saw my grandpa holding the egg. 

I was the only one paying attention, focusing on how you could possibly make a small oval stand. No one else was going to complete this challenge but me. When my Mom put her arms around my chest, and gave me a kiss on the cheek I pushed her away and said, “I can do it!”

My grandpa’s heavy eyes shifted to me and his lips peeled into a grin, revealing yellow stained crooked teeth. His hands, like a giant compared to mine, handed me the egg. I began working right away.

I made quick glances to Grandpa as I tried to balance it, hoping his gray eyes would light up at a correct attempt or that his white eyebrows would raise at a sign of progress, but he remained unemotional and still. I tried to ignore the commentary of my family at first.  Dad said, “oh so close,” several times with a laugh while Uncle David commentated like a sports announcer, “Jake Lacey. Balancing the egg. Can he do it? Ah, keeps missing.”

After several minutes my older cousin said, “Come on, Jake. Give it back to Grandpa.” I ignored him but when my Mom stepped in saying, “Hun, you can try later, it’s fine,” the doubt became harder to ignore. 

“Let me just try!” I said, trying not to sound upset.  

Eventually my Uncle Joe stopped impersonating James Cagney. My father raised his eye brows and stood up from the table and my brother began to attack me. “Jake you can’t do it.”

“Don’t worry, Jakey. It’s impossible,” someone else said.

I wanted to shut my family up and make them see that I could do it. I wanted them to know that just I could complete a task that was impossible for most. And I did. 

I finally stood the egg up right. It wasn’t balancing against anything; it was just standing up on its own. All because of me. I looked up in amazement, hoping to see my family enthusiastic with my accomplishment, but instead, half of them were gone and the other half had already moved on to new conversations. Only my cousin Rachel said, “Wow! Look guys! Jake did it!” 

As Rachel began to get my family’s attention I looked to Grandpa who was not grinning but seemed thrown by the egg standing up. As I waited for a response from Grandpa, the whole family began to circle back around the table.

Before they could all see what I had done, Grandpa snagged the egg off the table, smashed it lightly against a plate, leaving the egg’s bottom flat surfaced with a crack, placed the it on the table, and forced a chuckle as everyone watched the egg stand up on its own. He said, “That is how you make an egg stand.”
	
I quickly looked at my Grandpa, who avoided eye contact with me and laughed deliberately with the older cousins. My head spun to my parents, who had acknowledged Grandpa’s quaint gag but not my success and then it spun back to my Grandpa who was still ignoring me. 

I darted out of living room and up to my room. I dove into my bed, grabbed my Teddy and belted a long hard cry into my pillow. No one came up to check on me until after they had lit the candles.

He approaches the bartender and takes a seat on the stool, “3 tequilas”. Liquid flows from the bottle into the cups, one at a time; *tap, tap, tap*. “Enjoy” she says, he won’t though. They seem as though they are the bottomless abyss, gazing into the drinks he wonders where things went wrong, how everything got so fucked up.

“Happy birthday Johann, are you going to open your present?” excited laughter fills the air as the small boy frantically rips the paper and reveals a toy train set.  “Oh wow, look at that! Do you like it?” the boy laughs and claps his hands as his mother opens the train set for him. “Choo choo, all aboard!” He’s mesmerized by it, grabbing his favourite toy truck he plays with the toy train, chasing it with the truck and crashing them together.

*Gulp, gulp, gulp*. “2 more, please”.

“Come on Johann! We all did it.” Johann pedals on his older brothers bike, it was the older, BMX kind of bike when you would pedal backwards to brake. He pedals like a madman, wind rushing past his face as his peripherals turn to a blur, the view getting steeper and steeper as he goes downhill. As the ground begins to level out he sees the jump ahead, won’t be long now. A dirt mound lies ahead, might as well be a mountain. 


Freedom, sweet release. Soaring through the air the feeling is as close as he can find to freedom. “Come on, stick the landing you got this” he thinks to himself. Hitting the flat ground was always a hard landing but he pulled it off, he knew he could. “Ok guys I have to go home for dinner” said Johann. As he pulls into the driveway and puts his bike in the garage he sees his father looking out the front window as usual; just watching. 

*Gulp.*

Steak and potatoes for dinner, dad cooked the steak and mom made the potatoes. The food was great as always but there was something wrong, the stench of spiced rum was in the air. “You been out with your friends all day? You better grow up to be something, I don’t want some 30 year old loser living here. You’ll be sitting there hanging your head between your legs when your 35 because you never amounted to anything” said his father. Angry, Johann runs upstairs to his room. His safe haven, the only place he can find solace in this house. “Don, why do you drink so much? That was a really mean thing to say he never even said anything.” “Oh shut up, you’re a fucking slug. Lost your job because you’re incompetent and now you collect disability, all I do is work and deal with fucking assholes all day.” 

6 years it’s been like this, he hears the yelling from downstairs and doesn’t know how to make it stop. *Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump* he hears as his father makes his way up the stairs in his drunken state, he knows what’s coming, the inevitable. He’s coming into his room, his safe place, he doesn’t know why, he prays he would go anywhere but here. He wants his father to die. The door swings open and he knows what’s going to happen. First he would start by bashing his mother, then he would go through all the problems life has provided for him, then they would argue into the night and he would be, once again, late for school.

He’s 18 years old now, a legal adult. 

“My dad’s drunk as hell man, can I come over?” he says to his friend. “Sure, I got a bottle here we can have a few drinks before the party.” They drink, rum and coke is their drink of choice. They go to the house party, friends, girls, booze and cocaine; none in short supply. Drink after drink and line after line they party until the sun comes up. Johann, in college now is working towards his diploma. Such is the way things are when you’re that age partying and college seem to go together nicely. 3 years go by and with great satisfaction and pride, at the age of 21 he receives his diploma.

*Gulp*, “Another 2”.

He comes home to see a note on the kitchen table *“Had to take your father to the hospital”*. This is strange, why? He goes to bed and early in the morning his parents finally come back from the hospital. “Your father has pancreatitis” said his mother “From the drinking?” she doesn’t answer, but he knows. His father can’t drink anymore, he’s happy about this. “I’m going to take care of some things in the back yard” said Johann’s father. After an hour or so Johann goes to see if he needs help, but something is different about his dad. He’s drunk *“What an idiot”* he thinks to himself as he’s walking away in disappointment. He leaves soon after to go and party with his friends, alcohol and cocaine once again. For the next 2 weeks his father is in searing pain because of the drinking. This is the way things are for the next year with his father, pain, then recovery then alcohol, then pain. It stops eventually though.
For Johann the partying continues, he works but is late sometimes, hungover other times. Every weekend there is a party, alcohol and cocaine. Sometimes it’s only alcohol or cocaine, sometimes both.

*Gulp.*


Since he was 18 he’s been drinking and staying out on weekends, 21 years old nothing has changed. 23 years old still, alcohol and cocaine on the weekends. Even during the week doesn’t seem to be a problem for him. At 25 it’s mostly just drinking, he doesn’t know anyone to get cocaine from but every weekend the partying continues day drinking is ever more prevalent. 

*26 years old, 27 years old, 28 years old, 29 years old, 30 years…*

*Gulp.* “Thanks, keep the change.”
He walks into his apartment, this is it; 4 more tequilas should do the trick. Head between his legs all he can see in his mind is his father’s face.

Freedom, sweet release. *Click, click, click.*

I saw the whole thing and I’m the only one who knows what happened. I followed those two inside that house, saw the ungodly thing first hand and ran out screaming like a bat outta hell. I haven’t written in here in a while but I need to get this out and write it down before I go crazy. Something like this needs to be communicated whether it be through word of mouth or written in a personal diary like this. I’m afraid that what I saw last week may haunt me for the rest of my life.

I knew Alex and Julius from our ninth grade Algebra class we had together last year. They used to cheat off of each other during the weekly quizzes. They both lived a couple blocks away from me in our neighborhood, Willow Springs. Now and again I would see them riding their bikes down the street as they always did. One time they even invited me to play with them when they needed more people for their impromptu soccer game. It was then that I realized that they were really good friends.

I had just parked my car in front of my house and was getting ready to get out of it and head inside when I saw the two of them biking down the street on Friday night. They were wearing all black outfits. I thought that perhaps they were headed to the park or to the 7-11 to get a snack. But then I saw them stop just feet away from my car and get off their bikes. They then hid their bikes in the bushes in the lawn of the big house across the street from mine. They didn’t realize I was watching them from my car window as they then began to walk up towards the house.

The house that they were walking towards used to belong to a family that was made up of Mr. and Mrs. McKinley and their two children. The McKinley’s had lived there until the mother, who was a beautiful lady, committed suicide inside the home. I had to look at my diary entry from three years ago to remember the details of that day.

I was outside playing basketball in the driveway when Mr. McKinley had just come home from work around 6:00p.m. He tried to open the garage door from the remote in his car as he always did but the garage door was stuck and would not open. He got out of his car and slowly pulled up the handle on the garage door. This grabbed my attention because I remember that as he pulled up the garage door, I heard large clacking noises as if the garage door gears were grinding against something. As I watched Mr McKinley slowly pull up the door, I noticed there were two things dangling from above that were moving towards the back of the garage. Mr. McKinley continued to lift the door and it wasn’t until I saw the waste line of the woman that I realized it was a body hanging from the garage track on the ceiling. I wasn’t sure if her feet were moving because the suicide had just happened and she was still alive or if the opening of the garage was pushing her noose on the track towards the back of the garage. When the Garage was about three quarters of the way up, Mr. McKinley realized there was a hanging body in the garage and ran inside it and started screaming. I ran over to the bottom of their driveway. I saw the face of the lady and realized that it was Mrs. McKinley’s.
&lt;End diary entry&gt;

A couple of weeks after the suicide happened, my neighbor Jim Odessa was walking past my house while I was getting the mail for my mom. Jim was a good friend of Mr and Mrs. McKinley. We began to talk about the suicide and he told me that Mrs. McKinley had gone crazy living in that house. She was a stay at home mom that had a lot of time on her hands as her kids got older. She started to hear voices coming from inside the home. She had gone through therapy but it didn’t seem to help. Jim said that he thought it was the voices that told her to kill herself. A few weeks later, the rest of the McKinley family had packed up and moved a few towns away to get a fresh start. The home had been vacant ever since the suicide and I had only seen one person go inside, a realtor about a year ago. I had been very curious about what it was like inside that home since the suicide had happened.

The first thing that Alex and Julius did was go up to the door leading into the garage. I thought that perhaps they were aware of what Mrs. McKinley did in there and wanted to get in to see where it had happened first hand. It appeared that they were fiddling with the lock and trying to open the door when they heard a bird and jumped behind a couple of bushes. They then wandered back behind the home with the moonlight guiding their way. That’s when I decided to follow them to see what they were doing.

I waited about five minutes in my car and figured that they had made it inside when I didn’t see them come back for their bikes. I got out of my car and ran back behind the big house just as they had moments earlier. I jumped the fence leading to the back yard and landed in some weeds that were about as tall as me. That and the darkness made it nearly impossible to figure out where I was going. I slowly walked along the back of the home looking for a back door entrance. I had arrived at the door. At first I didn’t notice anything weird but after a closer inspection, I realized that the screen door had been cut open and the back door lock must have been picked because the door was ajar.

At that moment I had to stop and think if this was really something that I wanted to go through with. If I turned around right then and there and pretended that nothing had happened, I could just go home, watch TV and enjoy my night. But something inside me told me to continue to go inside that house. I did.

Once I stepped inside the house, it became pitch black with just the light from the door behind me shining in. I took a deep breath and inhaled a smell of must. I took about two steps forward and instantly felt a pain in my right thigh. I put my hand down to feel what I had run into. It was a table with some chairs surrounding it. I realized that I must have been in the kitchen but then I thought that it was strange that there would be furniture in the home. When the McKinley’s had moved, I remembered that they hired a moving company that spent an entire day moving furniture and big boxes into a large truck. Then I heard a noise that sounded like it came from upstairs. It sounded like a leaf blower or some sort of lawn equipment. The noise lasted about twenty seconds and then I heard silence again. I figured it was Alex and Julius and wanted to go investigate further. I pulled out a little flashlight attached to my keychain from my pocket and turned it on. I located a hallway that would perhaps thought lead towards the stairs and proceeded to walk forward.

When I reached the bottom of the stairwell, it felt like I had stepped in something wet and slippery. I shined my flashlight lower, towards the ground, and noticed it was what looked to be a puddle of blood. I screamed so loud that anyone inside of that house would have heard me and if Alex and Julius were just upstairs, they would have heard it for sure. I paused and just stood completely still, listening for movement. It had only been about a minute but it felt like an eternity. Then I heard the blower noise start again coming from upstairs so I started to go up them.

The first few steps didn’t make any noise but around the fifth or sixth step, there was a creaking sound coming from the stairs underneath my feet as I climbed them. I continued up towards what I thought was the top. Stair twelve, stair thirteen, stair fourteen, I counted as I heard every creek, taking into account the first few steps that didn’t make any noise. I made it up to about stair twenty and thought that by then I should have definitely made it to the next floor. I shined my weakly dimmed flashlight up towards the top and saw about five more stairs and then a sea of darkness. Five stairs was about as far as my flashlight would shine. As I continued up about twenty more stairs, there was that odd blower noise again. It was louder this time and felt more like it was coming from around me and not above me. This made me think that the top of the stairs were getting close now. There were about ten more stairs I climbed before I had reached the top. There was a hallway going left and right.

At this point I was very frightened but didn’t want to turn around. I whispered Alex’s and Julius’ name but didn’t hear anything so I turned left towards what looked to be a bedroom. I looked around and saw a bed and dresser. The dresser had a pile of clothes on it as if someone had been living there. I turned back out of the bedroom and walked down the hallway, passing the long staircase on the right. Walking down the hallway I heard what sounded like whispers. I couldn’t make out what they were saying but they were coming from above me. I shined my flashlight up and saw an attic door on the ceiling. I decided to continue forward and the hallway split again and I had the option to go either straight or right.

I went right and heard the blower noise again. This time it was louder than ever. It was coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hallway. I could tell that there was a light on in the room because I saw it coming through the crack below the door. I got close to the door and put my ear up against it. There was really not much to hear until the blower noise started yet again. I slowly put my hand on the cold doorknob and began to turn it. I was doing a great job of not making any noise as I turned the knob. My heart was beating like a drum. As I slowly pushed open the door, the light from inside the room began to light up the entire hallway.

I could tell from the size of the room that this was the master bedroom. The door was now open all the way. I walked in and looked to the left and saw a person wearing what looked to be a wig sitting down at a desk beside the bed. They were wearing an old red night gown and had black gloves on, covering their hands. They were holding a hair dryer in one hand and brushing their wig on their head with the other. I moved a little closer to see who they were. They hadn’t yet heard me because they were still brushing their hair as they looked into a mirror sitting on the desk in front of them. I was nervously shaking and felt a bead sweat drip down my forehead and onto my arm. As I continued to walk towards them, I began to get a glimpse of their wig in the mirror. Then I saw part of their forehead. Only it wasn’t really a forehead at all but what looked to be more like bone. I continued further when then realized that it was a human skull with a wig on it. My eyes made contact with the skulls eye sockets in the mirror. The person with the skull face flung around in the swivel chair and was staring right at me. The person flung up real quick and their nightgown flung open to reveal a complete skeleton. They opened their mouth and made a loud, slow groaning noise.

That was all I needed to hear before I ran out of the door and down the hallway as fast as I could. I turned left and started down the stairs. I remembered how many stairs there were going up but now there seemed like there were even more, maybe 100 or so. I never once turned around but continued down as fast as I could. When I finally made it to the bottom of the stairs, I heard my feet splash in the puddle of blood. Using the dim flashlight, I turned left and went through a room that I hadn’t been in before. I was too discombobulated to remember the way I came into the house at the time and I needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. There was a door straight ahead and I opened it. It had a window in it and it looked like a laundry room. I ran through that and opened the next door that was locked from the inside.

The moonlight was a little bit brighter in this next room. I then realized from the line of horizontal windows that I wasn’t in a room at all, but a garage. Quickly, I felt the wall for the garage door opener, found it, and slapped it as hard as I could. Instantly the garage light came on and that’s when I saw Alex and Julius. They were hanging from the track on the ceiling of the garage in the same spot Mrs. McKinley was two years earlier. They were hanging there lifeless, with nooses around their necks.

I heard that same grinding noise that I had heard when Mr. McKinley had just got home to discover his wife. The garage wouldn’t open. The loud groaning noise could be heard from behind me and I felt warm air run down my back. I ran towards the garage door, pulled it open just enough for me to slide underneath and ran down the driveway as fast as I could. I then ran and into my house and locked the door behind me.

I was contemplating calling the police but thought that if I did, they would think that I was somehow involved with their death. I also knew that no one would believe me if I told them what I had seen. I spent the entire night in my room with the light on thinking about the skeleton and poor Alex and Julius. I peeked out of the window every few minutes at the big house across the street but the lights were all turned off.

The next morning, when dawn broke, I went downstairs and looked across the street. I could see into the garage through the horizontal windows. There were no bodies hanging from the ceiling in the garage and all the house window curtains were pulled shut as they had been for the past couple of years. A day later, on Sunday, Alex and Julius were reported missing. I am going to keep the secret of what I saw inside that home forever. I’m afraid that what I saw last week may haunt me for the rest of my life.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1fskze,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fskze/after_reading_stephen_king_i_was_inspired_to/,

Sounds of gunfire pierced the air of the turbulent world outside. The shots echoed off the towering glass skyscrapers and crouching cement apartment buildings. The sounds of car horns and their obnoxious owners drifted through the city. The factories of industry belched smog into the morning air, giving the morning sun a purplish tint. Gavin was just waking up after another long night of work. He was sprawled out on a stained sofa, surrounded by fast food wrappers. Lifting his pudgy arms, he meticulously rubbed the sleep from his eyes. His rotund form shifted on the sofa as he turned over to look at the time on his digital clock. To him the little clock was a piece of the past, something from before the TV and computer screens. He grabbed the controller wedged between his meaty leg and the arm of the sofa. Suddenly an enormous screen turned on bathing his dark apartment in artificial light. Then another screen turned on, flashing a commercial for a blender, soon nine colossal screens were flickering and chattering away. Gavin flicked through the TV channels until he found the news channel. Scenes of the destruction and carnage of a middle eastern village washed over the apartment. A smile  formed on Gavin's face, as he recognized the inferno as his work. He looked over at his outdated clock. His smile vanished in an instant when he realized he was late for work. Using his black console controller Gavin entered into the United States Air Force flight screen. The screens became one large screen as they flashed the United States seal before melting into a map of the Middle East. The map was riddled with red dots showing where attacks were occurring live and in real time. 
                   Gavin was part of the Civilian Drone Pilot Program, an elite group of 2,000 Americans who piloted drones making offensive attacks on peoples deemed threats to the existence of the United States. Gavin remembered when he had met the fit, polished and sharp Drone officer who had come to visit his high school. Gavin was an overweight senior whose C average grades were not good enough for the high demand of doctors and lawyers. He was unsure of what to do after high school. His only passion were his video games. Gavin enlisted in the program and went through the years of classes and hours flight simulations. He was finally qualified for the 16th Unmanned Airborne Division. Though Gavin did not wear a physical uniform or pin golden medals on his chest, he still had pride in his country and his reputation on the drone chat logs. He was a decorated war hero who had conducted more than 2,397 Drone Strikes and 5,634 Spy Operations. He was at the top of the Drone leader boards and had unlocked all of the medals in the Drone program. Now he was an elite pilot who lead coordinated attacks, straight from the Pentagon. 
                           A notification appeared in the top left corner of the screen. Gavin toggled over to the notification. Immediately a video began to play. The images of a map and flight patterns materialized on the screens. A robotic female voice spoke and began to recite the mission details.
 ""You will be flying an offensive strike over a large urban target. Your first objective is to destroy the power station located in quadrant R3 on your map. Your second and third targets are two large skyscrapers located in quadrant R4. Your initial pay out if all 3 mission objectives are completed is $510,000 dollars, which will be deposited into your government bank account."" The message ended. Gavin was surprised to hear such a short and vague message. All he cared about was the $510,000 dollars he got if he completed the mission. It seemed simple enough. Gavin toggled over to the mission description and glanced over the briefing and memorized the three objectives. Eliminate the two target structures in the center of the city with minimal casualties and disable the cities power grid by eliminating the central power station. Gavin pressed the controller's buttons to accept the mission. His screen froze as the lengthy mission acceptance paperwork was loaded onto his screen. The importance of the 20 page flight contract was lost on Gavin, it was a nuisance. A male voice began to read off the carefully worded flight waiver. As the voice droned on in the background, Gavin leaned over to a table near his sofa and snatched up a half eaten microwave burrito. He gobbled up the remaining half in two quick bites before being interrupted by the robotic voice.
""Do you Gavin Pratt accept the terms stated in the contract that has been read to you?""
A ping sounded to cue him to speak into the blue tooth headset. Gavin spoke spewing ground meat and beans onto his stained shirt. ""I Gavin Pratt accept the terms read to me.""
A loading circle spun on the screen as Gavin finished off another microwave burrito. His screen soon showed a high definition panoramic view of a eerily empty runway. Due to the sensitivity of the mission Gavin was not allowed to speak to air traffic control and he began his pre flight check in silence. Though Gavin had never seen his drone in person he loved his drone as though it was the son he would never have. The sleek white aircraft was one of the most agile of its kind. When he had completed the pre flight diagnostics the drone turned on its engines. This was always a moment of joy for Gavin. He lightly pushed the toggle button on his controller urging the drone to pick up speed. The drone began its race down the runway and he watched as the drone leapt from the Tarmac and into the overcast morning sky. A message flashed on the screen, plus 4000 experience points-perfect take off. Gavin did not pay attention to the text and continued to gain altitude to evade enemy radar. Sometimes the flights would take hours above endless clouds and a deep blue sky. Gavin, against USAF regulation, would put the drone on auto pilot while he fell asleep to the soothing light of the flickering screens. Thankfully the destination was only few minutes away, and already Gavin could see the 3D satellite images of robotics factories and the sprawling slums surrounding the center of the city below. Two of the smaller skyscrapers were outlined in red identifying them as his mission objectives. Beneath Gavin's large soft exterior was the cruel nature of a sadistic boy who kills insects to watch them suffer. Gavin veered his drone towards the center of city where the smoke stacks of the power station that billowed smoke lay outlined in the red lines. It was his first target. He rubbed his thumb over the fire button. The HD video showed the tiny civilians scrambling about the city like aimless insects without a purpose. Gavin pushed lightly on the button and a single bomb dropped from the drone and Gavin watched as it fell. The bomb shrunk as it moved farther and farther away from the drone's camera. Then the screens were illuminated with a flash and the screen went dark. 
                   His apartment shook violently as Gavin was whipped from his sofa landing in a helpless heap on the ground. All nine of Gavin screens fell on the floor and shattered. The apartment windows imploded letting the sour smell of plastic and crumbling concrete fill Gavin's apartment. The windows that had kept Gavin from hearing and seeing the violent cacophony of the outside world were reduced to shards and pulverized dust. Gavin could not pull his immense weight up to see what had happened. Screams and the shrill whine of sirens filled his apartment. He was experiencing the sensory overload that no video game or tv show could offer. Breathing heavily he finally pulled himself up to the window, cutting his pudgy arms on the shards of glass that remained in his window sill. Peering down at the smoking concrete and rebar skeleton of a power station, he could see bodies slowly being dragged off by brave civilians and some bodies did not move. He looked up into the gloomy sky which was now dotted by traces of yellow anti aircraft fire and a single white drone which flew just out of reach. Gavin panted as he realized the drone he had piloted for years was now before his eyes. The pat pat pat of anti aircraft guns was louder than ever as bullets ripped through the wings of the drone. Gavin reached out helplessly to save his beloved drone which now spiraled uncontrollably towards his building. He made no effort to move, as though stuck in a trance as he watched the drone gracefully fall through the air. It plunged into the glass windows of the skyscraper. A brilliant blossom of red and orange consumed the building and Gavin with it. Gavin had almost experienced the most real and thrilling scenario he had ever had, almost like one of his video games.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,False,,,True,t3_1fmfca,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fmfca/looking_for_some_feedback/,

It was not a sudden seize but rather a long, mournful process of going and then not going.  The starter tried and failed in sisyphean fashion.  Once.  Twice.  It turned over a final time contemplatively, hiccuped, and stopped for good, slow contraction of the engine ticking against the quiet, high swelter of the fields around him.  

A transient breeze puffed from the glen off his right shoulder, blowing the heat and not relieving it.  He thought the summer here seemed benign compared to the compressed, saturated Julys of his youth in the East, but the dry, like a good parent or the law, was calmly and firmly inescapable.  He had maybe an afternoon’s worth of water.

It was with a translucent nausea which was the mating of vaporized oil, an excess of coffee, and the tail of a hangover that he had decided to make for Little Hook and the foothills without spending another day in the flat.  He sat at the counter of a diner passing his coffee mug from hand to hand.  Heartburn from the hot sauce on his eggs.  He sweated gently, brow furrowed, staring at the laminated countertop.  There was not much for him here, the marginal gains of this place rapidly diminishing.  There was not nothing, but there were few sounds, and the topographical features were more gestures of the hand than the arm.  The plains were insistent and subtle, the people slow, sure, and intimidating.  As though they either had what they wanted or could not know that they didn’t.  Rooted people.  There were no mechanics.

And he sought to go.  Before this he had been in school.  He had married.  He had worked. Those were all things he did back East, but their rights in him were usufructuary.  He bought a motorcycle and his mother did not talk to him.  His wife disciplined.  His father’s eyes gleamed, cast down at the floor.  So one day he left.

“Hot today.”

“I’m sorry?”

“I said it’s going to be hot today.  You need anything else?” 

A pause.  “No, thank you.  How hot?”

A look to the thermometer tacked on the wall, dusty and dead like a hunting trophy.  “Hot enough.”  The freezer behind the counter clicked on and began filling the room with its grumble.

With an impatient click of the tongue and a fumbling for change, he paid and walked out into the wide, flat, quiet street.  There was no gravity for people like him.  

He would probably make it anyhow.  A slow oil leak was mostly an annoyance to him, even when it dripped onto the exhaust and billowed up his nostrils.  At speed, the oven-hot cross tube would sit smugly collecting and atomizing the weeping, blackened eucharist as it flowed down the crank case.  A narcotic mating of rider and machine.  The leak seemed unfortunate but not fatal.  Not much to differentiate this run and the last, and Little Hook was close at hand.  He had set off and made good progress through most of the morning before the holy ghost in his motorcycle deserted him.

This was July and the day had started early and slow.  Having long since shed its chrysalis, the heat now pressed ruthlessly.  His heart beat faster.

The road was cracked, tarred, cracked again, crumbling at its edges as the earth regained its grip under the asphalt.  The pavement sloped upwards, straight and rolling gently like a long, cartoon tongue.  The tar snakes had melted and clung to the bottoms of his boots.  He lifted his feet with labor, dismounted, and got on one knee to peer at the salt-caked workings of the motorcycle.  Low fuel?  Seized?  Seals?  He couldn’t know, but it was nothing he could see.  A wipe of the brow.  A sip of water.  He looked once at the sky without a breath, sat, and began to study.",,False,,t5_2qhmi,1370143530.0,,,True,t3_1fi18j,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fi18j/perpetual_motion_or_the_day_before_the_charge/,

We were going around three times a week, and we were all getting quite good, but Mike was undoubtedly the best. This time would be different though, as Steve invited a few girls we knew from the ""sister school"" and they were coming along too. Everyone was dressed a little nicer and saw an incoming fart as a dangerous prospect rather than a hilarious potential missile.

We showed up and went downstairs to our two usual tables. The girls arrived a few minutes later and it was fun for a while. It was clear that the guys were a little more focused on their ""game"" rather than on running the table. However, Robinson's does seem to attract at weird bunch of people, almost unanimously at least a few years older than us, and this night soon became a prime example of that. In came a large, boisterous, extremely round man with one of those beards that look like he tried to replicate his buzz-cut on the lower side of his head as well. He was with an equally shady looking guy of average height, muscular build, and a clear Italian background. Of course, they came downstairs and set up at one of the two remaining tables in the room right next to us. I thought I was being paranoid but I could tell that they would be trouble. They'd only been here for two minutes and already discussed ""Rachel"" and her apparent slutiness loudly enough for the entire pool hall to hear, along with a number of similarly interesting topics. I could also tell they were already quite drunk, and by the beer pitcher brought with them from the adjacent bar, I could tell that they would soon be a little ""more"" drunk.

I tried to ignore them until I had a reason not to, and I felt it wouldn't be long. They were already cracking jokes among themselves about all kinds of people in the pool hall: the dedicated throng of Asian players, the oddly matched couple, the old man practicing alone, and of course, us. They weren't there to play pool, for all we knew they were only here because they got kicked out of some other place. I appeared to be the only one who really took much notice; everyone else was having a good time playing still. I beat Dan twice and I was feeling pretty good about myself until I realized that appearing good at pool isn't really much more attractive to girls than being average at pool.

It only took a few games before it started. Sure enough, the ""round guy"" looks right at Sarah with this stupid grin, ""How about a number, hunny?"" and looking to his buddy, ""I'd like to tap that."" Thunderous laughter among the two of them for round guy's bout of comedy genius. Sarah becomes very clearly embarrassed and angry, but we all try to ignore it and hope that's the last of it. Dan lines up for a shot and round guy pulls his cue just as he goes to hit the ball and of course this is followed by more laughter. More comments come our way, particularly towards Dan's ""greaseball"" hair, my apparently ""stuck up rich-kid"" look, Sarah's ass, and the ugliness of her friends. Steve, the more ""macho"", confident one of us, had had enough. I thought ""of course, another opportunity for him to make Sarah fall for him even more."" I didn't like Steve that much, he was kind of a jerk, but I guess it's times like these where it's good to have him around, or so I thought. ""Do you guys honestly think you're funny here? We're just here to play, who are you to say this shit?"" It didn't come out like usual. He was nearly trembling, clearly intimidated by the two thugs. They could barely contain their laughter enough to manage a response. It was hopeless. Steve began to gather our things, ""Fine, lets move. If they want this whole room to themselves then we'll just let them have it. We'll never win at this."" It seemed like the best option, so we agreed. I knew what would happen next. Round man and his apprentice would soon realize their next hilarious act and follow us to our new table. They did, and it all started again.

Mike, unusually late, pulled up right then. We first heard him, as he was driving an old Camaro and pulled up right next to the big window by the entrance. It was an unusual car for him, Mike was known for being really shy and avoided conflict always, so this screaming muscle-car was a bit out of character. He'd made money on the internet somehow and fixed this up last year, Junior year. Of course, he went right up to Sarah as he arrived. Everyone knew he was crazy about Sarah, but she was a bit out of his league. They were friends and he took her to prom, but he seemed unable to accept that she wasn't interested in him like that. ""What's wrong? You don't look okay,"" I heard him ask her quietly, and she just looked at him. Dan pulled him aside and told him what was happening I'm not sure what for. Honestly, was *Mike Harris* going to be the one who would tell these guys off and solve this? I'd only ever seen Mike even remotely mad once before, and that was when Ben made fun of the autistic kid to his face at lunch. Otherwise, he was one of the most mellow, peaceful guys I'd ever met, and it certainly wouldn't be out of place to call him a little unconfident. Mike looked at Sarah again, but this time he was angry, perhaps for the second time in his life. He just stared off into space for a while, clearly thinking. Again, this is Mike Harris, not exactly the guy we needed right now. Mike stopped staring off and walked over to Steve who was finishing a game and began to tell him something. I couldn't make out all that was said, but I did hear him tell Steve, ""don't ask me why I'm playing bad, don't even mention it."" They racked the balls up for a new game. Mike, usually ridiculously good, played worse than I'd ever seen him, bad enough to attract the attention, and laughter, of our new friends. He chipped balls right off the table, scratched nearly every shot, missed everything, and all with this very serious, frustrated look on his face. 

The insults were all directed right at Mike now. Maybe this was his plan, sacrifice his dignity to help Sarah. Not exactly a great plan to increase his chances with her, but I guess he was doing a good enough job of this plan. ""Hey kid, you drive that piece of shit this smooth?"" and Mike turned around. ""Look, that's enough. Clearly we all can't be here at the same time. Let's play for it, $20 and the loser leaves."" This was all directed right at round guy, who fell right for it. Barely able to contain himself, thinking he's frustrated this kid into giving up easy money, he agrees. ""Sure kid, let's see you try to impress your little girlfriends over there."" Mike looked over at the pool hall attendant that night, ""You hear that Aaron, we're playing for rights to stay here and play tonight."" Aaron was massive too, undoubtedly even bugger than the round guy, and he was talking with another employee from the bar who seemed equally interested. Aaron just nodded, he knew Mike. Aaron was almost a professional player, but Mike still tried to beat him every time he came in, and you could tell he liked Mike. 

So they played. ""I'll give us a good break, how about that, little guy?"" ""Go right ahead."" I'd never seen Mike like this, he already knew it was all going to work. The game was over even sooner than it had began. In  a stark contrast to his previous game, Mike pocked four balls in his first turn after round guy's fruitless break. After one more turn each, round guy had five balls remaining and Mike was ready to pocket his final solid ball. ""The little shit hustled me."" ""Ya think?"" Mike fired off as he looked directly at the drunken pair and not at the shot he sunk. In perfect position for the 8-ball, Mike smiled over at us and finished the game.

""Funny thing is, kid thinks I'm going to pay."" ""Don't care, just fuckin' leave."" This clearly enrages the two, but Aaron's approach and support from his buddy was enough to usher the pair out the door, of course while chucking an empty soda bottle at us and ignoring their playing fees. Everyone was ecstatic, a few of the girls hugged Mike and there were all kinds of high-fives, thanks, and general excitement among the group. Mike could do nothing but smile and take it like he always took any kind of compliment, humbly. I could tell he was only thinking about one thing. Sarah looked at Mike like she never had before, and she wasn't trying to hide it. I always thought he'd be the one to finally get her (we all tried) if he wasn't so goddamn shy and awkward all the time. They talked for the rest of the night while we played. He drove her home. She always avoided being alone with him because she knew he liked her so much, so I knew something was different. They're dating now, at least before they go off to different colleges in the summer. This changed something in Mike, I could tell it was a big deal to him. There was a sudden rush of confidence about him. He spoke with more conviction, louder even. And of course, he finally got the impossible girl he was always haplessly enamored with.

This wasn’t completely out of the norm for me, given my losing consciousness after rather “exciting” moments. Regardless, I must figure out my surroundings. I opened my eyes, and sat up. There was an abundance of fog, and it was very dark. There were roughly 13 houses, at least what I could make out in the fog. The fog itself had characteristics, as if it were a living, breathing thing. Many houses were in disrepair, and some were in flames. The road was truly in disrepair, with grass and trees (How long has this street been like this?) growing out of broken asphalt. Each door had a pristine white note on it, untouched from the devastated road. “Maybe I will be able to find out what happened if I read the notes?” I thought aloud. Like a game of detective, which was a favorite of mine in my youth.

My name is Siegfried Möller. My home from which I am thoroughly misplaced from is Langenburg, Germany. I walked down the foggy road, made sure to walk around the growing fire, and set out for the first house. 6503 was imprinted on the door, the 3 hanging off it’s hinge. I read the note, “Remember to thaw out the chicken! Love, Mom”

That is rather ordinary, compared to what I assumed would be on the note. I thought “I’m gonna kill all a ya’ll” or something dark like that, assuming the sorry state of the street. I continue down the road, with lack of any alternative. The next note said “Log 5/30/27: The tests have been going at an adequate pace. The virus is manifesting from the subject from across the road. It won’t be very long. R. Burke- out.” This may be a clue as to what happened here. I continued down the road, the notes getting further along time, and darker as I progressed. From the simple note from a mother, to the doctor’s logs, to people in panic, to finally dwindling survivor groups at the end of the road. There was one final, pristine house, with a black note firmly placed on the door, with letters at a fine font. It read “Get busy running, or get busy dying.” What on Earth could that mean? I looked behind my self. Eyes. White eyes piercing the fog in which I had recently traversed. White eyes... looking at me. They were coming closer... I have to run. Fast. I ran, yet not faster than they were coming. One look behind me told  me that they weren’t human, although they may have been at one point. I ran through the forest, thinking that I left behind them. I rested at the base of a large oak. I closed my eyes for a couple of seconds. When I opened them, they were all right there. I then closed my eyes, but not on my own accord.

I awoke. I felt a great chill in the air, as if there was no warmth left in the entire world. I felt very tense, as if I were on a plane. I looked down, through the wood planks I was sitting on. The ground is so far away. That is when I realized. This is the city of Rothenburg, recently industrialized. And I am 300 feet from the ground. My fear of heights got the best of me, I could not move. I was on the outskirts of town, with a chain link fence behind me. I started to walk along the planks. This is the place I used to be with my friends in, used to have fun in. As I walked around a corner, I heard something behind me. The distinctive noise I heard, was one I had heard before, but could not place now. Then as it got colder, and the noise got louder, it hit me like a ton of bricks. Them. I ran along the rickety boards unlike I had ever ran before, and before I turned the corner I saw them. There were dozens of them, going straight through buildings as if they weren’t there. I increased my pace. I jumped on the smaller rooftops, yet they still persisted. There was a hatch, open, on one of the rooftops. It became my goal. I glanced behind, they couldn’t have been ten feet away from me. I vaulted off of the current rooftop, landed on the other, and rolled into the hatch. It closed behind me, mysteriously. It was a normal studio apartment, spanning two floors. I didn’t exactly question its existence, nor did I wonder why the hatch was left open, ready for anyone to fall into. I scanned the room. Lights were on and  it seems that it was a completely average place to live. That was remarkable to me given what I had witnessed before it. I looked out the window. They were gone, and for that I was happy. I went to the bottom floor to a mostly empty room, with not much more than a telecommunication device mounted on the wall, complete with a video camera. As I advanced into its field of view, a woman began speaking, her voice heard through the device. “Hello? Is someone there?” I was unsteady, and taken aback by the sudden sound. I spoke back, “Who are you?” She responded,” My name is Charlotte. What are you doing in there?” “I guess you can say I dropped in.” “That isn’t important. What is important is if you know what is happening.” “I honestly have no idea. It seems to be a virus of sorts. Do you know any way to stop them?” After a moment’s hesitation, she said,” We think a weapon may, but those of us that got close to them are no longer who they once were.” “So there are more of you?” “Yes” “Where are you, exactly?” “We are just about a kilometer north of you, but you’d never make it. Take the Walkie-talkie off of the hook next to this, so we can keep in touch.” “Where should I go, then?” “If it is a virus, like you said it was, you should go to the old laboratory, which is 2 kilometers to the west. There is a gun in the cupboard.” “Alright. So I have to figure out what happened.” “Exactly” I left the building, and set out west.

I had always been opposed to violent weapons, but desperate times call for desperate measures, right? The road I set out on was in apparently better condition as I progressed. This was the old commercial area, where many bought groceries and the like. It was now deserted, and mysteriously so. I hadn’t eaten or drank anything for a very long time, and I was already mentally unstable before this. I was hearing things... or was I? Maybe the things I heard or the things I saw were, in fact, of my own imagination. What if this was a dream? I thought better of it, although the thought lingered in the back of my mind for quite some time. I checked my pockets, and felt my wallet and not much more. That was rather distressing, that I had lost all other items that typically were in my pockets, such as my phone and keys. After all, this was a long walk, and the simple pleasures of messing around with your phone are long forgotten at this point. I thought on that Charlotte character. What if she didn’t exist? I mean, I have thought up crazier things, but this one is rather unlikely. The pristine lab was ahead. I pressed the green button on the walkie, and said “I am near the facility, and I have a bad feeling about this.” about 15 seconds later, Charlotte responded, “You have to go in and find out what happened.” Huh. She had a much darker tone of voice that time. I disregarded it. I was at the front steps, and the whiteness of the building was only affected by the dark, characteristic fog around it, which seemed to emanate from the open windows and doors of the place. I walked into the open door, and stepped inside.The door slammed behind me, sending me into a panic. I pressed the button on the Walkie, “Charlotte?” She responded, nearly in tears, “I am so sorry.” “What?” The walkie went silent. Just then, the absence of warmth was felt, and as I looked through the windows into other rooms, and outside, I saw dozens upon hundreds of Them. Their gleaming white eyes disproportionate to their heads, they were staring at me. Once again, I was alone. But not completely. I ran to the wooden door down the hall, the faces moving as I ran. I hit the door with all my strength, yet to no avail. It didn’t move a centimeter. As I looked behind my self, I saw They were looking at me, but not moving. Sure, the ones behind those in the front row were moving, as if to get a closer look, but they didn’t get closer to me. All of their eyes shifted to the door from whence I came. It slammed open, much as it had slammed shut earlier. There was one of Them in the doorway, much larger and darker than the others. He appeared to be wearing prison stripes, with  a block lettered BURKE on the front. Where have I heard that before? He shifted over to me, shifting being the correct word, as he wasn’t walking on land or flying in air. I pulled out the handgun I had gotten from the apartment earlier. “This has to be worth a shot.” I said, under my breath. When he got to 10 meters away from me, I discharged the weapon once. He recoiled, obviously shaken from the blow, then regained his balance. What are they? What is he? I proclaimed, my thoughts heard out loud, “WHAT ARE YOU?!?” I discharged what was left of the weapon, and threw it down the hall. He fell down, and was motionless. I couldn’t believe it, I had killed it. Maybe this was over. He rotated upwards, as if on an axis. He then ran to me, in a very human- like way. The name of Burke finally hit me. The scientist. He seemed to grow in size and wrapped around me in a way that a constricting snake would to its prey. I was enveloped in darkness, for now and eternity.

Or so I thought.

1369392179.0,2,self.shortstories,1eypl7,Luciana of Sivlaatar,thirdrealm,4,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1eypl7/luciana_of_sivlaatar/,"Luciana of Sivlaatar, a cursed being, as the locals called her, had now only her next task on her mind. She knew the cost, she knew the prize and yet getting fucked by this ugly old man made her feel a bit disgusted. At least I still feel something. She slowly caressed his back and then reached his back pocket on his half-undressed coat, reached for the key and then sharply tightened her legs to finish the job. The man fell breathless on the ground with his eyes almost squeezed out of his eye sockets. To die fucking with me is an honour, bastard. 


She now slipped her clothes back on and all the while molested the key in her hand with surprising lack of feelings. Why is it this easy with all the men?  She combed her hair, no rush, took one more look around the richly decorated bedroom of the city major, who as it happens was the sole owner of the most valuable safety box in the safe. Of course, she could pick the lock of the safe and then do the same with the safe box, it would take time and effort though, while picking up the mayor and consequently taking his key took her less than twenty minutes. These men, all the centuries ran past and they are still the same.

She hid the corpse under the bed, unlocked the safe and there it was. The thrill of the hunt, the feeling she did all this for. After all, it was one of the few feelings that she still could recognize, feel and respond to, a being alive more than two thousand years has not much left to enjoy during her life, but this, this she could still enjoy as much as always. She collected artefacts from the Age of One, from her youth; she collected them as memories, for her own faded away long ago, and hoped to find answers to her life.

Her hearth rate slowly rose with anticipation, she took out the box, carefully, as if to prevent its breaking, yet the box was a full metal sturdy safe with good ten centimetres thick sides. Now, yes, now I can feel it. She inserted the key in the keyhole and turned it so slow that she could hear even the slightest sounds of the lock being opened. It was a moment when something you could almost call a smile emerged on her otherwise indifferent looking face. She took of the lid and turned the box upside down to quicken the emptying process. A bunch of documents that meant immense wealth and a few pieces of diamond jewellery fell out. Is this just to make me angry old man? Why do you give me this junk? She briefly looked at the legs under the bed and then back at the box. She noticed right away and started to remove the fake bottom of the safe with newly found enthusiasm. As she uncovered the slim wooden desk that separated the secret space from the outside world she felt her heart rate rise again and savoured the feeling of being alive, she did not feel this good in a long time.

But then, all the anticipation converted into pure anger. She flung the box furiously across the room where it struck the wall and stayed struck in it. She stood there legs wide apart for stability, she stood breathing quickly in a more or less fighting position and was looking for something else she could throw or kick. She pulled the corpse of the major from under the bed. She clenched the note that was under the second bottom, she clenched it in her fist as hard as she could and then stuffed it into the majors’ mouth. Then she kicked him in his head with a fury of a dragon. She was kicking him while the words in the note were keep popping up in her head. “I ride the dark, I eat my shadow,” her pointy shoe broke into the major’s skull and she charged another mighty kick, “for I have come from words down, below,” now she could see his eyes leaping out as she kicked them from inside out, a strange feeling of satisfaction was immediately supressed as another word reminded itself of its presence, “My touch sinister, my goal but one,” she accumulated all the strength she could muster in her last kick, “Find me young child, for I’ve just begun.” with a loud splash the remains of majors’ head detached themselves from the rest of the body and flew out of the window.

She jumped out after the head, mounted her black horse and sped away into the night. Her long black hair, now released from their chains, were flowing freely in the wind as she rode her horse back home, her almost perfectly white skin contrasting with the hair. The skin gleamed as the moonlight reflected itself in her face, thinking that it is honoured to fall upon such beauty. Her pale green eyes were now looking straight towards the forest. She needed to calm down somewhere and think and there was no better place than home to do so. Her black dress with red embroidery and white lace was almost like a princesses’, she did not really need it but if felt good to be admired, and she could almost hear the trees sigh in awe.

The hut, the place she called home, was placed in the middle of a forest called Sivlaatar, a forest no one dared to venture in, for forces of magic and unknown were manifesting their power between the dark trees, bending the reality at their will. In a carefully picked location, at the intersection of energy currents which ran through the earth the hut collected that energy and supplied its mistress with it. The spot had one more advantage, it was remote from everybody and everything and thus was very hard to find. From the outside, the hut looked more like a shack about to fall. But behind the door there was an interior of a completely different kind, more like a castle. The door was an entrance to a long tall hallway lined with statues of various looks, ages and materials which they were made from. The arched ceiling gave off the feeling of majesty; at the end of the hallway was a single room, her bedroom.

A fairly large room stuffed with items of various quality and value, the treasures beyond imagination were just carelessly lying around empowering the feeling of a castle. Some of the items were a significantly more interesting than the others. There was a goblet full of water that was slowly flowing over the edge and down into a sink that was placed under it, a golden bird in the corner of the room did look almost on fire as his feathers were slowly turning to dust. Above her bed a hilt of a sword was levitating but no blade could be seen, only a small crack in the wall directly in the direction the hilt was facing hinted that the blade is present none the less.

Luciana opened the door to her bedroom and marvelled at her treasures, she touched each and every one of the items of extraordinary quality and type and slowly a faint smile started to emerge again. Then she gently placed her finger on a spot next to the bed and sled the finger in an upward direction on the wall. A silent click could be heard as a secret passage opened with the slightest of breezes flowing out of the dark corridor. She then entered the darkness and emerged in a small room with just one piece of furnishing in it, a circular table in the centre. The room was lit by an item on the table. It looked like a small, detailed, painting folded in the shape of an orb, but the painting was torn to pieces, which were still floating around the edge of the orb. It was a map of the known plains; an item of tremendous power for it stored a portion of the Earth’s magic in its elaborate design.

Millennia ago, the world’s magic could no longer be contained within itself and so the planet exploded, tearing itself apart with tremendous energy but as whole continents elevated they spread apart making holes where the magic was pouring out freely into the oblivion and so the balance was partially restored. The “planes” as people started to call the other continents, islands, rocks, that were floating around their own rock were kept in their paths circling around the planet’s core. People from the times when the world was one were soon forgotten and so was the fact that on many of the other planes, other creatures live as well. Whole nations became self-contained on their own piece of rock and with no means to explore the other planes they simply lived their lives with what they had. Of course, from time to time an adventurous soul emerged from the crown and tried to leap across the magic eruptions which separated the planes. It looked like lava searing out of a volcano. But nothing could hold these explorers back. So they took a magic embroidered rope and hurled it to the other side. Then, trying the firmness of the anchorage on the other side they leapt, never to return. This, of course, discouraged the other citizens and so in the last few centuries barely anybody tried to cross to the other plane.

The small room was lit by the light exploding from the sphere, Luciana moved closer to the orb and placed her hands around the spinning globe, as she always did, and then the light disappeared, the pieces of paper flew away and scattered on the ground leaving the room helplessly dark and empty. She conjured a light in her palm and looked at the table, where the orb was calmly spinning just a few seconds ago. A note reading

I ride the dark, I eat my shadow,

for I have come from words down, below,

my touch sinister, my goal but one,

find me young child, for I’ve just begun.

As soon as she finished reading the note, it burst into flames, lit the room with bright light and then she could feel a force pushing her chest, she felt as if she’s being pressed by between two walls, just before she fainted she used her last breath to shout out loud.

“Luciana of the One will destroy you!”

I posted this to /r/writing awhile back, but didn't get any comments on it, so I'm posting it here in the hopes of getting feedback. I'm a novice writer who's never been published, and I can take criticism so please be honest. Thanks* 

All day the sun burned furiously hot, causing sweat, stench, and thirst to all those unlucky enough to be under its power. There would be no darkness tonight; the sun was not going to let a little thing like the post meridian tell it to stop shining, burning, and suffocating the denizens of Little Rock. 

Before the Age turned, there had been a nightly darkness, or so people were told, but now, in the Dusk Age, day and night were separated by days and sometimes a full week. 

Cammy often wondered what it must have been like to live in the Noon Age, when men had been able to predict not only when the sun would rise and fall, but the changing of the weather as well. The first people of the Dusk Age had arbitrarily carried over the static 60/60/24/365.25 time keeping system, longing for a return to the days of the Noon Age. The changes had been so subtle at first that the educated people of the Noon days chalked it up to a random aberration. When the changes became more pronounced, they investigated for any breaches or alterations in their systems. Then one day, the Age turned, everything broke, and nothing was ever the same. 

“Don’t start crying again.” Jason, Cammy’s brother told her.

“Excuse me?” she answered. She hadn’t heard him come into the kitchen where she sat at their copper-top table, staring aimlessly out the one window the room was afforded. 

“For a second there, you had that look on your face that you get before you cry. You know, that sour lemon/I’m about to fart-face?”

Granted, she had been about to cry over a loss she never experienced, but could still feel, and worse, she did know what face he meant—an oft discussed family trait—but she could not let him know that; she was supposed to be the strong one, and he wasn’t supposed to be so damn observant.

“Halve off!” she told him, raising her heart finger in a curse-implied salute.

“If I cut myself like the Dusky Downers do, who would be here to make sure you don’t drown mom in your tears?”

“Just leave me alone, Jason. Go back to your star maps and your penny women, and let me think.”

Knifing me in the back might be kinder than your constant disproval of the way I make money for us all; the money that buys your clothes, food, and the clean water you waste on tears.”


“Leave… me…”

“Maybe,” Jason started, pulling Cammy back into the chair she had begun to rise from “you can stop thinking of me as your baby brother for a second and let me tell you something?”

Nodding was the only response he got, but it was enough.

“Older men, men who have been studying the stars since before mom was in high school, are starting to formulate what comes next. There was the Dawn Age when men saw little more than spirits and gods in the workings of life and only just started to understand nature and their own natures. The only science they had beyond trial and error was star mapping, and they guided themselves through life with wonder, fantasies, and false emotions.”

“Perhaps,” Cammy interrupted, exasperated “you can stop being so full of yourself and remember that I went to school too and don’t need a history lesson: After the Dawn Age, there was the Noon Age,” she continued for him “when everyday dawned and dusked brightly, and by understanding and utilizing the sciences of Earth, men were able to reach beyond it, to not only map the stars, but to see them, visit them, collect them from, and understand the star’s individual sciences. Their potential was limitless, and they went forward at such a blinding pace that going backwards seemed so impossible, it was never given thought. Now,” she concluded “we are in the Dusk Age, scrabbling at the ground trying to pick up the pieces of the ages before so that we can survive in a world that is foreign, hostile, untamed, and has changed all the rules of its sciences. What little fragments we have left of the Noon age are mostly useless to us, and we have had to relearn many of the ways of the people of the Dawn Age to survive. Is that about right, Monsieur Genius?”

Quietly, and completely out of character, Jason nodded and shed a single tear.

“Really?” Cammy asked, flabbergasted and slamming her hands down on the table. All the times he had mocked her for crying about the death of the Noon age, something no one alive and not even their great-grandparents had been around for and yet, here he was crying, as if… “If this is just you playing some stupid game with me!” she erupted suddenly.

“Sit down,” Jason asked meekly “and let me tell you what’s next.”

The fear in his voice was more than enough to make her obey, but her nature was one of skepticism, so her mind was ready with a few pinches of salt for whatever he was about to say.

“Under all the talk of relearned sciences, new discoveries of edibles, and propulsion systems, there is a deep fear of the next Age. Think about it, Cammy, what comes after dusk? Night” he answered himself. “Our nights may either be full of sun or wholly absent of it, but in the Night Age, will there be any day? How will humanity survive without sunlight? We have already seen how the flora and fauna adapted to the changing of the Age, but humans, relying solely on their temporary sciences, were left blind-sided, and next time, forgive the pun, we’ll be left in the dark. We’ll be cold, blind, and helpless; so low down the food chain, worms may not wait until we’re corpses to start their feastings.”

“Very good, fear monger,” Cammy replied, keeping her skepticism forefront “but there was night in the Dawn Age, so why not dawn in the Night Age? And each age lasted for few millennia, while this one is only a few hundred years old, what’s the worry? Why did you cry?” The last was her real question, the only reason she was still having this discussion and had not just walked away from another of his wild—possibly just to mess with her—stories. 

“What came before the Dawn Age?” he asked her in the stoic, marmoreal voice that was a much better display of his inner character. He provided his own answer in that same voice; “A Night Age” he told her. “One so deep and dark, that it was only vaguely remembered in the Noon Age. They had a different name for it, but it still confers the meaning; The Dark Ages. They also called that Noon Age the Golden Age, and thought nothing of the previous Dawn. More importantly, there was nothing of the Dusk. It is impossible to know if any of their sciences changed as they had only just begun to scratch the surface of science, and the stars stay constant, so their mapping is the same as ours, but changes occurred, Cam. From Dawn to Noon they gained knowledge, wealth, and dominance over the Earth, just like our more recently passed forefathers, and also just like them, Night fell and wiped it all away, but how? For us, we know that violent solar flares and the subsequent fission reactions in the atmosphere destroyed all the Noon Age’s technology, disrupted the laws of physics, and the biology of all living organisms on Earth—besides humanity—changed to adapt to the new environment, but what about in the Ages past? Did the Dusk before the Dark Ages pass so quickly that it did not bear mentioning? Did they not recognize its appearance? Is there even a Dusk Age or are we already experiencing the Night’s terrors? We don’t even know if we can really rely on any information that came before the Noon Age. It’s just all so, so…”

“X” Cammy told him when he started to cry again, pulling him into a hug. It was the way she told him that she understood and agreed; that she was his big sister and there was no shame in being worried. “X”. It was their slang for all will be well, because I love you and understand you: you are not alone. 

“Zora” they said together as they heard the front door open and close. Their mother, the reason they had their own slang, was home, and they had to release their embrace and dry their tears before she got upset, and became useless for days. 

“Anyone home?” she called out from the foyer. “I have dinner for my two happy children!”

I am a soon-to-be junior studying video production at UT Dallas. I have been browsing this subbreddit looking for inspiration and story ideas for my next short films.


Needless to say, there are many talented people here who have all written pretty amazing short stories.


When I get back to campus in June, I will have three months to make as many short films as I can. I already have three films planned, which should take about a week to complete.


If you have a short story that you think would make a good short film adaptation, I would love to hear from you!

I woke up and decided to write it down as true as I could to my dream. What do people think? I'm no writer, but any comments would be appreciated*

“I’m no hero” he said as he remembered picking Cpl. Glasser’s brains out of his hair. As he remembered the thunder of the pistol as it scattered blood and bone and skin and hair all over the boiler room. As he remembered the thump of the lifeless body hitting the metal floor. Blood squirting from the crater on the cpl’s head as the heart clamored for life. 

“I’m no hero”, tears began to streak down his face, he contorted as he sobbed uncontrollably. He remembered scurrying into the corner behind the engine as he saw shadows slide by and the metallic beat of footsteps. Flashlights glazing over the boringly painted room. Voices of some strange dialect.

“I’m no hero”, he was still in the corner. Crashing inside his chest, looking down he was struck by the way he could visibly see his heart beating. The engine of the ship had long been turned off, but his own engine had been awakened by primordial fear. Fear of the shadows. Fear of the footsteps. Fear of the gunshots he could hear coming from distant corners of the battleship. 

He remembered blackness. Then other voices. Lights swam in his eyes as frantic, not confident footsteps, began to surround him. Shouts. Hope. Cheering. The rhythmic swatting of helicopter blades against the virgin ocean air. Then blackness again.

Three years passed. Over his heart which once nearly tore itself out, over the tailored military dress suit now were adorned medals for bravery. Citations and medals of honor. Everywhere he went he was celebrated. On sticky summer days on the boardwalk his face obligated children to salute and their parents to nod.

He was content to mask his internal trauma with a smile and waving. Feigning interest in what other people had to say about his ordeal.  The air conditioned auditorium that smelt of learning and childhood brought some serenity. He pointed at hands in the sea of bright faces, and whoever he pointed nearest to would stand up and belt a question at him. This was fine. Was fine.

“Mister, are you a hero?”

The psilocybin had finally run its course through my brain. The shadows had finally stopped crawling along the walls. The sliding glass, where there had once been a garage door, showed dim images of ourselves huddled over a chess board. I was now sure that it was not an alternate reality, but merely a reflection. Everything was returning to normal and Bob Marley was guiding us back.

“Your move.” 

I think Patrick had more going on in his mind than me. For his 21st birthday, he had planned to ask whatshername to marry him in Vegas. She never showed up. She never called. She changed her number. He finally caught up with her by making a phone call to her mother’s house when he knew she was going to be there… something like a year later after said incident. She wouldn’t even give him a chance to speak.

“Please don’t ever contact me again. I hope we’ll see each other in heaven.”

I was heartbroken for him. Not as heartbroken as he was, though, I’m sure. His wounds distracted me from the scars on my own heart, for a while.

“Sorry… hmmm…”

Patrick was always one of my favorite people, at the same time so full of life and so deeply flawed. I felt his struggles and I think no one else did. His soul was a great dichotomy, a far-flung spectrum of sadness and joy that the people around him were always trying to squish back into the range of NORMAL. Fucking assholes… seriously.

Ed possibly knew all about it, too. I never considered him my intellectual equal, but he wasn’t a fool. He just had no respect for women and it is hard to look at a guy the same after you have seen him maniacally torture and kill an animal or two. His arrival distracted me from the game.

I am pretty sure Ed always looked down on me, too. It made me that much more resentful when he started dating Katie. If I could have gotten my shit together in time, I would have pursued her to the ends of the earth. I just wasn’t that confident in myself, yet. 

I had this feeling that I could take the world and everything in it for myself, but society and everyone around me wanted me to be normal. I was being as pigeon-holed as Patrick. 

I was being led to believe that my instincts were all wrong and that I should buckle down and actually attend the classes I signed up for, land a good career, enslave myself to a 30 year mortgage, and pretend for 5 minutes that any relationship I was in was not actually doomed. Fucking assholes… seriously.

I had spent the last year wandering up and down the coast of California. Splitting my time between Berkeley and San Diego could be grueling, but it was a small price to pay for the freedom I needed so bad. My heart was spread thin… San Diego, Newport Beach, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Berkeley. So was my mind. Absorbing neuroscience, philosophy and physics was exhausting, but I was determined. If there is any truth to be had in this life, it would be in understanding consciousness. I couldn’t just take anyone’s word for it, either. I had to know for myself. I had to peel back the layers in every possible way to see what was inside.

I was at a stage in my life where I was slowly phasing out my sinister ways. No more counter-intelligence operations and misinformation campaigns. The chains of the Mormon Church were broken. The parents no longer kept a watchful eye. There were just the women that I loved. I could never say “no” to them, but I knew they had secrets of their own. I will credit them with much better intentions than my own, but my feelings were still sincere and I will give them the benefit of the doubt that theirs were, too.

The game of chess had ended, but I didn’t know it, yet. Al had arrived. I don’t know his reasons, but Al hated Ed, too. Patrick sensed there was going to be a problem. I sensed his masked concern. Like always, he was going to try and keep it light. I would play along.

“WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?”

Clearly, Al was drunk.

“Hey, Al. Long time no see. You want next game? I’ve just about got this one won. Grab a seat. What’s been going on?” 

I never let my nervousness show, but I would not be able to focus on the game, at all, now.

11... cxb5?

“What are YOU motherfuckers doing here?” 

The last time I had seen Al was over a year before. I had Vicki on the phone and was trying to get him to listen on the other line. I was convinced that the truth mattered to him. It wasn’t obvious until that moment in a dirty, dimly lit garage that the light bulb went on. He hated me. This wasn’t about what he thought I lied about. This wasn’t about the fact that I had slept with Vicki or Tiffany and Alexis. It had been him who framed me all along for moving those pot plants! It was a series of thunderbolt revelations. I had been too self-absorbed to see it; too concerned with my women. This was Brian Clark all over again, except Al Kwon might be able to kick my ass. I would probably have felt better knowing that this was just a prelude to Josh Chastain. Too bad we can’t see the future.

“Just taking it easy, Al. Same as always. How you been?”

“Are you drunk, Al?”

I don’t know if Ed knew what had transpired with Al that last summer, but he didn’t seem too concerned, yet. After all, we had all been practically best friends for years.

He slammed the sliding door shut. We didn’t know it, at this point, but he slammed it so hard that the latch broke; leaving us all locked inside with his drunk and angry self.

12. h4!

I knew Patrick shouldn’t have kept playing; denial was about to take him completely. He was a pacifist, and had backed off to let me fight alone before. I knew he would be no help. I doubt Ed had ever been in a fight, either. I was sure it was going to be just Al and me. I have talked my way out of people determined to fight before, and, usually, it was relatively easy to do. Some people, though, are especially determined to find conflict.

“What am I going to do with you?” 

Clearly, Al was referring to me and this was about the time he produced the sword. He flourished it. Protecting the knee. A basic form; defensive, and poorly executed. The blade was turned wrong 90 degrees. If I had a sword, I wouldn’t have any concerns. Unfortunately, all I had was a pipe and a lighter.

“Al, you are fucking drunk.”

If Ed hadn’t understood a moment ago, he understood now. I was immediately thinking I was going to have to find a way to separate Al from that sword, but it would be risky. We had to keep him talking. Ed got on board with the idea, immediately. Patrick started to lose his mind.

Adrenaline seared it into my memory. Al, holding the sword to my throat; crying, telling me about all the evil things I had done, but remaining surprisingly non-specific. Ed tried to work some magic, too, and we talked about growing up and being friends and how Al always felt like an outsider. I commiserated, but every wrong answer resulted in a knick. The blood was starting to drip from my neck.

Patrick began giggling. Maybe he was feeling the mushrooms. Maybe the whole situation was too much. Maybe he was just plain fucking crazy. When he got too loud, Al yelled.

“SHUT THE FUCK UP, PADDY! WHY DO YOU ALWAYS FUCKING LAUGH AT EVERYTHING! SHUT THE FUCK UP!” 

Maybe Patrick was actually able to find the humor in the situation. It was surely beyond absurd; especially when you know everyone’s stories.

“I was always a friend to you, Al. I lent you money and never asked for you to pay me back. I stood up for you. I told you secrets that I never told anyone and you betrayed me and told them to everyone. I never retaliated. I know what you’ve been through. You always saw yourself on the outside. That is why we were friends. I was the black sheep of every group I’ve ever been in.”

He wanted to hear my pain. I obliged. I made stuff up. Oddly, it was hard to get too personal in front of Ed or Patrick, and I avoided the real pain. Superficial pain seemed good enough for Al, though. His cheek was against mine and he was practically drooling when he wanted to hear about the time David Flaherty tried to beat me up.

 October 12, 1989:

	She wore a red dress of exquisite formidability. The fabric, elegant in its simplicity, tightly enveloped her body in a manor that distinguished the alluring curves of her veneer. The top was cut just above the breasts, exposing her shoulders; from the waist down, the dress loosened and draped to where it was cut just below the knee: revealing a red ribbon, equal in shade to that of the dress, tied securely around her right ankle. The dress acted as a bright contrast to the seemingly monochrome topography of the Lexington Avenue subway station on 59th Street. The white-tiled walls were now withered and coated in miscellaneous filth and graffiti art. The station's accepted commoners and vagrants, alike, all flooded it's floors and weaved through parallel columns spanning the length of the platform. Public benches were offered for the weary; mutters of impatience among the waiting could be heard under the flicker of fluorescent light. This was indeed, she thought, a beautifully tragic representation of social conformity. 
	She was 36 years of age as of June, though she appeared to be in her mid 20's. Her hight was average: slender body. Her skin was smooth and pallid, almost white in color, with light blush accents. She had always possessed a pale complexion ever since she could remember. As a result, she had often been mistakenly labeled with ailments and profiled by her former peers. Her skin also offered an ideal canvas for the red of her dress and the dark indentations of the bruises she bore.Though most were concealed, one could barley be seen emerging from the seam of her dress on her upper back; she was used to bruises. Her lips were red: again, similar to the red of the dress. Her eyes were bright blue, emphasized by a minimal application of eye liner. Very little cosmetics were used. She possessed a naturally youthful face: one which did not accurately reflect her age. Cosmetics were rarely applicable. Her long, dark hair was pinned in an upsweeping French twist with the graceful decent of frayed strands that intertwined on each side. This was a suitable frame for her aesthetic facial features and a fitting style for the formality of her appearance.
	She descended the stairs of the subway station and stepped onto the lowest level of the underground platform. The station was moderately populated: comprised of a cluster of age groups ranging from elders in suits to small children, who's restless stirrings pronounced the stationary positions of their guardians. With each step she took, the click of her high heels resonated up the length of her legs to the seductive sway of her hips. Immediately, the diverted attention of those around her brought about sporadic glances: not only of her beauty. She carried in her right arm, with her, an infant child wrapped in a blanket and suspended in a woven cradle. The child was abnormally silent, given its age and the current setting. The child was dormant and not a sound was uttered. 
	She walked, with a confident poise, to a wooden bench near the center and sat down to the left of a man with a leather suitcase resting at his feet. The man appeared to be in his late 20's. He was relatively tall, medium built, with a freshly shaven face and black hair that was gelled back like some bad 50's nock-off. He wore a tattered, leather jacket over a black crew neck shirt, blue jeans, and some worn sneakers. He was well groomed and sanitary, though his attire reflected some financial difficulty. Upon the bench, she placed the cradle with the child on her lap and folded her hands against her lower abdomen. Her legs were stationed tightly together, and her posture was straight and unrelenting. She remained motionless, faced forward, for a moment staring at the train tracks. She was lost in abysmal thought in an almost transcending foreshadowing of her future actions. This was not so much out of hesitation or doubt but of reflection and confirmation. She knew what she had to do and how it had to be done; there was no avoiding it. This in no way, though, diminished the difficulty of its nature. Without parting her lips, she inhaled deeply and turned to face the man sitting aside of her. Her gaze was unyielding and expressed a measure of both innocence and confidence. She bore a slight smile as though she was content with the man and her circumstances. It almost seemed fake, like a sarcastic mask to comfort any onlookers. For her, this was often the case; however, this was the first time she had smiled in years. It took the man a considerable time before he became aware of her, for she spoke not a word. He turned to his left only to be entranced by her profound beauty. He could not remember a time when such a tantalizing sight had graced his eyes. Though he silently inquired as to the cause of this wanton attention, it was of no great concern at the time. For a moment that depicted an eternity, they remained suspended in an uncomfortable silence before a sound was uttered.
	""What is your name?"" she asked. Her voice was seamless and youthful. The man hesitated for a brief moment before clearing his throat.
	""Jake Crow,"" he replied. 
	""And what is your profession?"" she asked. Her diction was formal with no noticeable accents  and a relatively fast rate of speech. Jake once again hesitated. He found it queer to be abruptly confronted with a series of disjointed personal inquiries. He felt as though he was being interviewed for a job or something. She had a detached, clinical way about her, the way she conducted herself, that gave him a sense of uneasiness: never breaking composure.  
	""I'm in the service,"" he retorted. 
	""Are you married?"" 
	""I'm sorry... who are you?"" he finally asked. Her smile widened, as if he had met her expectations, as she closed her eyes and faced forward. She paused for a moment. 
	""I was a dancer once,"" she said with nostalgia. ""I studied dance at Juilliard and performed for the American Ballet Theatre in New York... I was exceptional.... and that was a long time ago."" She paused again and turned back to face him. ""Do you know why men find the color red alluring Mr. Crow?"" she asked as she subtly directed his attention to the fabric of her dress. He shook his head. ""Though some argue it's purely the cause of societal conditioning or popular culture, there's reason to believe that men's attraction to the color red is a result of primal, biological effects, their nature, for this anomaly often occurs naturally. Valentines day hearts, carnations, the red illumination of a brothel, red sports cars and the ties that drive them, the attire of nobility and the red cross of authority... Red not only symbolizes passion and romance but power and anger... hate....death."" Her voice was now sullen and repressive. ""Sometimes, Mr Crow, we have to bleed red to prevent those who draw it."" The man was struck speechless. He was almost overwhelmed by this peculiar meeting and what she had said and was unsure on how to retort. He could see pain in her eyes, though she was attempting to hide it; these words had meaning. He decided to change the subject. 
	""The child is beautiful,"" the man said nervously. ""Is it yours?"" Her face brightened in a bestowal of mirth at his question as her smile returned.
	""Yes,"" she replied as she gazed down upon her. ""Her name is Alice."" She stated her name as though there was nothing else. 
	""I'm actually engaged,"" he said. ""We've been trying to conceive, but with no luck.""
	""Everything I am....everything I do is for her,"" she said. ""Remember that."" The distant sound of an approaching train resonated throughout the station. She seemed flustered at the noise. She leaned down and untied the red ribbon from her ankle, folding it and gently placing in the cradle beside her infant daughter. She stood up and placed the cradle on the bench where she previously sat. She bent over and kissed the child affectionately before handing the man a small leather-bound diary. ""Please give this to her when she becomes of age....Please take care of her."" 
	""What?...I....I don't understand,"" he stuttered with confusion. She smiled once again at him and her daughter before turning to face the tracks. Her pace was constant as the locomotive neared. She crossed the thresh hold marked with caution and balanced upon the ledge before closing her eyes and falling forward. Her morbid greeting with death, elegant in its simplicity, was as a lily on a grave painted in red.

You know when you find out that you lost the item that you simply cannot lose? That’s me today. I lost a watch that was passed down from my grandfather, and he told me never to lose it because it was part of the family, kind of like a family heirloom or something. It didn’t matter that much to me, but I couldn’t help but feel a little bit of remorse. 


The watch had seen things, things that you wouldn’t even believe. For one the watch had been with my grandfather in World War II. It almost was lost in the war but my grandfather literally risked his life to make sure that it would continue to be in the family. He was captured in the war and some fool wanted to take it for himself, my grandfather simply said “no” and the person beat him nearly to death. I guess that after that the person got bored and went off to try and steal something else. Yeah, that watch has seen things you would never believe.


My grandfather told me about his own father and his experiences with the watch. He said that his father was wearing the watch during the Great Depression, said that he was going to keep the watch even if it meant starving to death. The dust storms made the watch sort of rusty and decrepit looking but he fixed it up real good. My great grandfather’s wife kept on bugging him to sell the thing for a dollar but my great grandfather would not have it. That watch was here to stay; it has seen some things you wouldn’t believe.


My own father passed the watch down to me a few years back. He told me that he was wearing the watch when he met my mother. They both happened to be driving along and their cars just happened to break down in the same spot. He said it was like one of those things you see on TV where people just fall in love instantly like they were pieces of a puzzle. After they got both of their cars fixed he gave her his number and that was that. 
You know I still haven’t told my story about what the watch has seen. I was wearing the watch when I saw a horrible car crash right in front of me, one of those crashes where the car flips over. I stepped out to see if I could help. There was a man in the car and he was cut up pretty bad, he was on death’s door it seemed like. He grabbed my hand with the watch on it and didn’t say nothing, just held on. The watch was there, it saw the man die right in front of it. After that the watch felt like it wasn’t even there, like something was gone from it. I don’t know, that watch has seen some things you wouldn’t even believe.


  When I finally found the watch sitting inside the couch I thought that it was time to give it to my son. He took it and kind of just threw it on his desk. I tried to explain to him that it was a family treasure and that it was important to keep because it had seen some things he wouldn’t even believe. After that my son asked what it had seen. I told him about the time I was climbing a very tall tower in some big city and that it had seen all the people beneath it, saw them walking about and it saw that those people all had different destinations. It saw that all of those people would just kind of ignore each other for the most part. It saw the birds in the sky and the clouds and the big buildings all combining to make something quite beautiful. It saw everything at that moment, and I mean everything. My son put on the watch and told me that it would see more than everything, that it would see impossible things that you would never even believe. And you know what? I believed him.

Looking outside the window, a picture lay of a snowy winters day. A small accumulation of snow lays on the ground, surround by apartment buildings on all sides. I looked down at my pocket watch, the seconds ticking away creating the only sound in this room, noticing I have quite a while until the target shows up. I take another puff on my cigarette, smoke diffuses through the room, and dissipates as a ghost would. Only leaving behind ashes on floor. It's like a human life. The body is the ash and the smoke is the soul. When life is up, the smoke dissipates, leaving behind the ash. Up here I feel divine. My bullets are like rays of sheer power that make smoke dissipate. I remember in math class learning about the difference between a ray and a line, a ray continues in one direction forever, where as a line continues in both directions forever. A few trash cans started to rustle outside, knocking me out of my daze. I grabbed my rifle and peered through the scope to see what it was. Damn cat, I thought. To prevent myself from getting into another daze, I looked around the room. It was empty, all possessions were gone. Probably taken after the owner was moved to a concentration camp. All that remained was a lone picture of their family on the wall, now knowing it's been torn apart. I used to have a family once, but that too was torn apart. My dad left us right before I was born and when I 13 and my brother 15 our mother overdosed and died. It was just me and my brother. When we were twenty or so, we both got drafted into world war one. That was when the last string of our family fell apart, and my brother defected to the united states. That was the last I ever heard from him. Every night I miss him, knowing I will never see him again. A car finally puled up so I got my sniper ready, this was going to be a huge exchange of intelligence, and I'm supposed to stop it. His face ends up right in my scope, the face of my brother, now a United States spy. I have loyalty to my country though.

When infected, effects occur within the hour, reaching its peak at the first hour, and slowly decreasing in effect until the seventh to ninth hour. As expected, colours began changing rapidly en noises started fading and/or increasing in volume. Never was I afraid, for I had a strange feeling of tranquillity. I was genuinely surprised by how good this stuff made me feel. I did not feel infected at all. I loved this new phenomena, for I had discovered a world completely new to me. Yet I did not know the name of this world, though I would discover soon enough. My name is not important, nor is my age, my country or the century I live in. You may now wonder why I chose not to tell you. Do not worry, these things will become clear to you as time progresses. For now, back to the basics. My room started to appear larger then it is in reality, and the sound of my own voice had a strange echo to it. The most amazing part, however, was the colours! Instead of the dull, mind numbing colours I was so used to see, I experienced an explosion of vivid colours, each forming a stunning fractal. It may also have been an implosion, since most of this has to do with my brain. Being intoxicated for the first time was indeed a strange and surreal feeling. The hunger that had drove me to eat this particular mushroom had disappeared, to be replaced by a rapidly beating heart and a slight nausea. I left my small room to begin a journey that has altered my view of the world forever. Within five minutes, I reached a portal in the shape of a laurel wreath. Tempted by this sight, I walked toward it so I could better distinguish it. For some odd reason, it appeared as a testimony to some creature, some life form I was not familiar with. I decided to wait no longer, and to continue further in my journey to witness all new sights. However, as I stepped into the wreath, I was transported into the world that was so far more interesting than my own.

The two Sophomores led the way, finally stopping at a chain linked fence.
	“Alright,” the taller one said. “Its just through here.” He pointed to a gap in the fence were the wire was torn away. It was a pretty sizable hole to fit through, which reinforced the idea that I shouldn’t be doing this.
	“Before we go, can you first tell us what you want to show us” stated my friend, who was beginning to sound agitated. 
	“I already told you guys that we literally cannot tell you. We can’t. Why don’t you have a little patience?”
	“Well, being completely honest, this sounds extremely suspicious and we really don’t know you guys that well.”
	The second sophomore sighed. “It’s broad day light and were in the middle of the fucking city, what are we gonna do?” He did have a point. 
	There was silence for a moment, then my friend said “Fine, but this better be worth it” and climbed through. I followed, going head first and scratching my leg on one of the loose wires. I stood up and was now in the middle of an empty construction site. I looked back to find the two sophomores climbing through the whole. They proceeded to stand up, dust off their pants, and start jogging towards a pile of bricks and dirt nearby. They reached it in seconds, looked down behind it, then called back to us. “Its still here, come on”. We walked over to finally see this ‘thing’ we had walked all this way for, and well... 
	Now, I can’t really describe it, except for the fact that it was...well not really glowing but more of emitting light. Oh, and it was pretty small two. It was just...kinda there in the middle of the dirt behind the pile of rubble. I stared at it for a while, but my brain was coming up short. The image wasn’t really going through, but I wasn’t getting a head ache or anything. It felt like free fall in my thoughts, or more of just empty space in my mind. Finally, I turned to the Sophomore and asked the most basic question. 
	“Well, what is it”. 
	“Can you tell me what it is?”
	“Not really”
	“And I can’t tell you”
	So we sat there and stared at it. I was mesmerized by it, and my brain had given up trying to make any sense of what it was seeing. After a couple minutes of staring, I asked if anyone else knew about this. “Yeah” he said. “Why do you think no one else is here. They shut it down when they found out about it.” 
	“And no ones doing anything about it?”
	“I bet their sending someone out soon to check it out.”

We spoke with him a little bit earlier today, and got a little bit of insight on what this guy is really like. Amidst the dry humor and short fuse, is an intelligence that can not be taught in public school. An intelligence that comes from what he believes to be a dying trait, common sense. Today is a day not like most, you wont always get to talk to Riley more than once a day, so enjoy every time you are included, enjoy it, take it in, learn something, I know I do. Now here is this afternoons conversation:

Me: Good afternoon Riley, are you doing better this afternoon? You left here pretty bewildered.

Riley: Yes.

Me: Yes, what?

Riley: Yes, I am doing better, and Yes i was bewildered. You are quite observant. 

Me: I'll accept the compliment, and ignore the context.

Riley: That's like banging your sister but ignoring the fact that she is your sister, it may feel good, but in no way, shape or form is it right. 

Me: That is quite the analogy, but I can see where you are coming from. 

Riley: Yadda yadda four eyes joke. You are too easy.

Me: So i have been told. 

Riley: Been told what?

Me: That I'm easy

Riley: Slut

Me: Got me again.

Riley: Ok, Im done, moving on, now. 

Me: Right, so whats something you wanna talk about? I always ask the questions, so you go on about whatever it is that you wanna go on about.

Riley: Hmmm? You know i dont like talking when told to talk.

Me: Yes, i know, no pressure, if you talk, then great, if not, thats ok too.

In this period of time, I looked at Riley, and he looked at me. He looked around the room as if he were looking in the deepest parts of his brain for something to talk about. While he thought, his lips would move, so little that it was barely noticeable, no sound would come out, just little whisps of air. He was talking, but he wasnt saying anything. 

Me: Put sound to the words your lips are forming, Riley.

Riley: It has nothing to do with anything...

Me: So, take the mute off. 

Riley: Well I was walking through a field on my lunch break, and played baseball since i was in tee ball, and I hate when people talk over me. When I get angry what i wouldn't give to hurt someone, and to just get the love that i feel i have been robbed of, but i didn't deserve Christmas presents anyway. Its dark, and it hurts when your back side is slapped with a belt, but i love my sisters despite what anyone thinks and why is there war overseas?

Me: ....

Riley:.....

Me: Wow....

Riley: Thats why I dont take mute off.

_______________________________

Time: The all too near future
Place: A courtroom
Setting: Final sentencing for the last remaining capital offense on the books of an apparently kinder, gentler more just world where equality is no longer a mere aspiration.
_____________________________

Justice

The prisoner stared impassively into the camera. The bright lights causing beads of sweat to form above his eyes and forcing him to squint, his perspiration-soaked thinning hair flattened unflatteringly against his forehead. No sound could be heard other than the faint hum of the air conditioning whose airflow was directed from the high ceiling above the high seats of the three judge panel, towards the three judged, keeping their immediate area comfortably cool. The camera trained on them remained a respectful distance away, and no harsh lights illuminated their somber countenances.

All three judges stared at the camera showing no emotion, their hands folded in front of them on the surface of their capacious bench on top of three equal, neat stacks of paper piled before each judge. Everywhere on earth citizens watched the unfolding drama over the neural net that provided a fully immersive experience indistinguishable from reality, effectively placing every citizen of earth in the courtroom as the Chief Judge began to speak in a deep, resonant, clear voice.

“The evidence against you has been examined. This tribunal finds you guilty of the charges against you by a unanimous vote. Have you anything you would like to add before we pass sentence?”

The camera changed back to the prisoner. The lights brightens around him and the heat rises perceptibly, adding fresh fuel to the trickle of sweat flowing down his flushed face, causing a bead of sweat to form at the end of his nose that he cannot swat away because his wrists are restrained by metal bands at the armrests of his chair, outside the viewing range of the camera which has a tight zoom on his face. “I am guilty of no crime,” the prisoner spoke in a low voice full of palpable weariness and resignation.

“You are guilty of the most heinous of crimes,” the Chief Judge contradicted. ""That is not open to debate. This is your final chance to make what amends you may to those whom you have harmed through your selfish, deviant act. It will have no effect on the sentencing by this Court.”

“But I have done nothing wrong,” the man emphatically repeated, the perspiration rolling down his neck deepening the growing ring of sweat absorbed by his bright orange jumper, staining a dark collar of moisture around his neck.

“Silence!” the Chief Judge hissed. “The record will show that the prisoner is unrepentant. This Court finds that the prisoner willfully, maliciously and without justification removed his neural connector with the purpose and effect of disconnecting himself from the Net. We further find that the motivating factor for this egregious, willful and repugnant crime was the attempt to abandon the Common Consciousness and establish his individuality separate and apart from the Communal Mind. We further find that the subject is in full possession of his legal faculties and capable of understanding the criminal nature of his acts, and, perhaps most tragically, that he fails to see the enormity of his crime.” The Chief Justice faltered slightly, delivering the final words of the Courts sentence with a slight tremor in his voice. After stopping a moment to compose himself as his learned colleagues looked on impassively, he continued. “It is, therefore, the judgment of this Court that you will forever remain disconnected from the nets from this day forward.”

Upon hearing the Judge’s words the prisoner’s eyes opened wider, attempting to digest their import. Could it be? Could he finally be allowed the freedom to regain his humanity? The unalienable right to be an individual for the first time in his life? The opportunity to live in a world in which he could have original thoughts, genuine emotions, and the opportunity to be different from everyone else? The joy in these words nearly made him faint with relief and unbridled joy, allowing him for the first time in his life the possibility of hope as tears welled in his eyes. He found he could not speak, could not express even the simple words “thank you” to the Court. It was as though he were emerging from a life-long nightmare, as if . . .

“The prisoner’s IP address, 999.999.999.999, shall be erased from the Nets,” the Judge continued as the prisoner’s tears flowed freely. His existence shall be forever stricken from the Collective Consciousness lest it germinate there and once again grow sedition in our midst.” The prisoner wept openly now while smiling broadly. “The death sentence for this most heinous of crimes is hereby commuted so that the prisoner may be allowed the individuality he craved for the rest of his natural life, devoid of the comfort of humanity or the distracting influences of life.”

The Chief Judge then paused and took a deep breath. “It is further ordered by this Court that the prisoner shall have his eyes, eardrums, tongue and olfactory organs surgically removed that he may not see, hear, taste, or speak with any other human being for the rest of his natural life. thereafter, he is to be remanded to a hospital where he shall be restrained to a bed and tended to by robotic life support aids. The sentence of this Court shall be carried out immediately and shall be witnessed by all Citizens of Earth as partial reparation for this most heinous of crimes against humanity.”

The prisoner’s screams lasted only a few moments as an anesthetic was administered and the cameras were re-arranged in preparation for justice to be carried out.

Jobs disappeared and investments vanished. Max was hit hard, but he was better off than most. It could have been a lot easier if it wasn’t for the divorce though. 6 months before the economy fell apart, Max’s marriage did. He was the first to admit it was his fault. They use to be in love and inseparable as college sweethearts. He built his wealth with her, and he always said she deserved the money she got after the separation. The darker his life got the brighter those memories became. It’s funny how the mind tends to forget the bad and only remember the good. His wife was gorgeous in college and beautiful in her later years. Max loved his money and his wife. It made him feel good that his friends envied his lifestyle. His old secretary moved to Florida so he needed to find a new one. He chose a young girl fresh out of college. It was pretty obvious why he hired her; she was young, beautiful, and full of love. It wasn’t long before they started to go on vacations together. They skied down the icy slopes of aspen and swam in the blue oceans of the Bahamas. She loved it and he loved her. His wife wasn’t stupid; she found out pretty quickly. Max handled it the best he could. He thought maybe all of the money she got would make her feel better. But, it’s hard to feel better when you’re being replaced with a newer version. Then, the recession came. Everything changed when the money went.  Max wasn’t too upset when his mistress left, but it made him regret how his marriage ended more.
3 years later, Max was living in a small 1 bedroom apartment in the outskirts of Chicago. His hair was long and stringy and his beard was thick. His ex-wife married some mechanic in Florida and now was supposedly pregnant. Max never wanted kids, his ex-wife would mention it sometimes, but he always said he was too busy. The thought of having a child now wasn’t so farfetched though. He would raise him right. Teach him how to act in public and talk to girls. They would start their own father-son business. Max would teach him everything he knew about the business world and they would be happy. But, women like wealthy men. He knew it wouldn’t happen. Who would want to have a baby with a 40-year old living in a 1 bedroom apartment?


Max spent most of his time at the casino. Gambling is illegal in Illinois, but since 10% of it went to charity it was allowed. Max never knew what charity it was for. The casino was the only place Max could really feel happy.  He loved all the sounds that came with it, the loud laughter, the ringing bells, the dull murmur of small talk, the clanking of chips, it all distracted him of what was going on inside his head. The waitresses knew him by name and the regulars were the closest things he had to friends. He really liked playing poker, not so much the game, but the banter. Shooting shit with the other players, flirting with the waitresses, winning hands it was all fun. Max always played Texas Hold’em and on this specific night he was on a hot streak.


Steve played with Max a lot, and could tell when he was feeling good.


“Damn Max, look at you go, your building cell towers over there.”
“Yah, you know me though, lady luck will turn on me soon enough. She’s a real bitch.” Max started to stack his chips from the last hand he won. Steve was right though, he had almost quadrupled his money since he got there and was feeling great.


“Can I get you boys a drink?” A tall blond waitress snuck up behind Max put her hand on his shoulder and smiled.


“You sure can Shirley, the usual please!” Max tossed her a 5 dollar chip and winked. Max liked all the waitresses at the casino, but Shirley was definitely his favorite. She was young and beautiful. Max always tipped her big and she always flirted back.
“You’re too good to me honey!” Shirley eyed his tall stacks of chips. “Doing well, huh?”


Max blushed, then smiled.


“Just wait, once I win it big I’ll take you to the finest restaurant in Chicago. Make an honest woman out of you.” He played with his beard. It was a nervous habit.


“Looking forward to it darling!” She put her hand on Steve’s shoulder. “What about you, thirsty?”


“Another beer!” slurred Steve, obviously intoxicated at this point.
“Coming right up! Good luck, boys.” Shirley walked away swinging her hips. She never looked back, but was aware of their eyes on her butt.


Max had folded the past few hands, he wasn’t getting much. The dealer tossed him two cards. He was the big blind, an automatic call. He slowly bended the corner of the cards back until he saw two Q’s looking back at him. They were both black and Max couldn’t help but see two big tits. He was excited pocket ladies were a great way to start. He knew these guys would kill for this hand. But he couldn’t waste these beauties. If he was too aggressive he’d scare all of the players off and get nothing.
Max knocked on the table, “I check.” The dealer flipped over 3 cards. The queen of hearts, 7 of diamonds, and the 9 of hearts came up. Max was ecstatic, a three pair already and none of the cards on the board could challenge his hand.


There were four people playing, a man with glasses bet one hundred dollars. Steve called and so did the man next to him. Max raised 50; he was trying to get more in the pot without forcing them out of the hand. It worked. They all called. The dealer flipped over a 2 of spades.  Not a threat. The man in the glasses bet 100 again and they all called. Max was going to wait to the next card to up the ante.


The dealer put down the king of hearts right in front of Max. Max brushed his long bangs out of his eyes to get a better look. The king’s hair touched his shoulders and connected to a thick curly beard. He was holding a knife that seemed to disappear behind his head.


“I’m all in!” Steve screamed so loud that the whole casino seemed to stop. Max turned to look at Steve, his face was bright red. Everyone else folded. Max laughed to himself. He almost felt bad taking his money. Steve was a good guy.


“I call, three ladies.” Max said while flipping over his cards. It was the first time he saw the queen’s faces. He wondered why they made them so unattractive. Max reached out for the chips.


“Flush!” Steve turned over a 2 and 3 of hearts. The hearts on the cards were as red as his face. Max had lost and had no money left. He looked down then got up from the table and started to walk away.

“Hey Max! Lady luck sure is a bitch, huh? Steve reached into his pocket and gave him some quarters. “Play the slots on me, bud.” Max smiled and walked away.


He sat down at the closest slot and put a quarter in, as he pulled the lever a girl in a short red skirt walked by. Max turned his head to follow her butt down the aisle, but he jerked back around when there was a loud ringing in his ear. Three jackpots were looking back at him. He had won the 100,000 dollar jack pot.


“I won! Oh my god I won! Holy shit, I can’t fucking believe this!” Max was yelling at the top of his lungs. The pit boss walked over followed closely by Steve.


“Congratulations, sir” The pit boss reached out his hand, but it was knocked away by Steve’s drunken hug.
“You lucky son of a gun! Maybe, that bitch does like huh?” Steve was squeezing him tight, but Max was looking right at Shirley. She walked up and kissed him on the cheek.


“How about tomorrow night I buy you drink?”  Max asked with a grin.


“Oh sorry, I work tomorrow. You should come by though. I’ll get you a drink on me.” She smiled and walked away never turning around.


Steve put Max in a headlock. “Yeah right, Max ain’t coming back here, he’s a millionaire! Why would he come back to a sorry place like this?” 

Steve let go of Max’s head. “Ain’t that right Max?”


Max put his arm around Steve’s shoulder. “Damn straight bud, never coming back here again that’s for sure.”

My cat walked up to the bottom of my chair purring for food. I stepped up, it was around 4:30 A.M I got the milk from the fridge and heated it. I slowly trudged back to my chair to drink the rest of my coffee, and get ready for work. I dressed in my work clothes to prepare for the long office life that seemed parallel to mine in every way. Boring, tiring, depressing all adjectives of the 7 hours of my day. I pull the scarlet tie around my neck, and tie it tight. I think of it as a noose, and  I'm selling myself to a world of corporate foolhardy. I rather enjoy the rash decisions of my superiors, and how they'll do anything scrap together any more pennies to lire line their pockets. I soon smiled in the mirror seeing as how I am now 27 and look as old as a 35 year old. ""Tis' what happens when you sell yourself to work for the devil."" I said with a smile. I left my house with keys in hand smiling, I walked down the street to the large black building, windows lining the sides of the enormous beast of the city. I walked into the building and walked to the line in front of the check in desk, these days we need to sign in to work to protect from terrorism. As the drones in front of me sign in I finally reach the front of the line to sign in the lady mutters my name, and I walk to my office. It's on the 78th floor, 2nd to last, no windows which made me sad. When I was hired this made me terribly sad since I love the sun.

TALL BLACK LEGS
(( ↮ ))

An indirectly lit, long, underground structure with a low-hanging ceiling is disturbed with the unsettling sound of heavy noises. The stinky, dark place looks morose and murky, with its concrete supporting beams and bleak corners. A constant and distant echoing of water is only present, more like a soothing white noise. The floor is covered in dirty, muddy water. In the middle of the room it flows with a seemingly determined speed and course towards the invisible longer end, into the black. It might be some kind of an old sewage system. The walls are covered with grey slime and dirt. Irregularly placed pipes gaping on the sides. Like the broken rib-cage of a slaughtered animal.

The light comes from a somewhat circular shaped opening on the ragged ceiling – the work of a grenade – beams of a reflector come closer, bathing the filthy and foul smelling place in an unwelcome, neutrally tinted glow. With moderate noise something big and heavy is hoisted down. A tall, black oddity with legs and arms. From the middle of it comes the bright light, instantly seeking left and right, sweeping across the area even before it reaches the ground. It’s big, tall and black, heavy looking but non-metallic. It extends it legs, so it reaches ground sooner, it levels itself, the cables pop off with a tinny sound. The reflector stops sweeping, the thing adjusts itself and straightens up its back. The dark structure stands in silence. Like if waiting for something or someone, almost casually. Nonthreatening.

A couple of hundred meters to the end, where the sound of splashing water is more prominent and the darkness even darker, a very frightened, very little girl, in very dirty nondescript clothes hides behind a concrete beam. Crouching close to the black water – more like mud – trying to remain calm, breathing through her nose. Eyes and mouth shut tight. Concentrating on the white noise of the sewage waters. Breathing regularly, she doesn't seem to be concerned by anything. Her face is peaceful and calm. The opposite of someone who is being hunted.

A very long 137 seconds pass when the dark, big figure bends down silently and starts crawling forward in moderate speed. The little girls eyes pop open, her face still calm but her eyes increasingly reflect fear and despair. The big thing starts to sweep around with the reflector again with more intense light. And starts to call out in a very calm, very soothing gentle female voice towards the darkness. Without a rush, audibly.

**“Don’t be afraid. I’m here to help you...  Hadiya Nozwe...”**

**“Don’t be afraid, you are safe now... Hadiya. Come, we will go home. You are safe now.”** It calls out into the black, like a mother.
**“I worry about you... Hadiya, are you here? Are you here?”
“Where are you, sweet child? Where are you... Hadiya... I miss you very much.”**
**“Everything will be alright, come out, no one will hurt you anymore.”**
The gentle, pleading and comforting words echo through everything.
**“I came here just for you my love, I missed you so much. Where are you... Hadiya?”** It scans around hastily, moving the light left to right.
**“Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid... Hadiya.”** The little girl with panic in her eyes starts to slowly crawl in the stinky water, that had been recirculated a million and a billion times, starting toward the nearest wall on the left.
**“I’m here to help, I love you, please come back to me.”** Echoes the friendly plead from wall to wall. She ignores it and crawls steadily with lips squeezed together.
**“Don’t be afraid, you are safe now... Hadiya. Come, we will go home.”** The sound came from closer now. Heavy steps rumble in the water.
**“Where are you, sweetheart?”** Faster movement generates bigger waves.
**“Are you there?”** Sounds much closer.

Some strange noises are coming from the wall she is headed for, a slow movement, and three short, adult men dressed in dirty brown robes and faces covered with masks climb from a small opening. The first sees the little girl and waves to her, she starts to crawl faster. The two other men stand in nervous stance clenching metal tubes with triggers on their end, while the first also starts to crawl in the water towards the little girl. The big dark figure stops, erects to two legs with a grotesquely curved back. From the arms silently rotating barrels slide out. It’s listening. Seconds pass in silence. Then it bolts forward fast, the water loudly splashing around its feet, thumping heavily. It turns left where the frightened little girl starts to run towards a man standing up from the water who is blinded by the light, but runs towards the little girl. The big dark machine shoots a blast between the two armed men while they are raising their weapons. The explosion blows one to pieces, the second ones right limbs and face rips off, his torso half open. He is tossed against the wall by the explosion and bounces off into the water, like a piece of rag. The man and the little girl are trying to run to the nearest supporting beam. He tries to grab the little girl, to hold her in cover, but the big dark figure fires a rapid round of bullets ripping his legs and torso apart. His flesh and blood tainting the little girl’s already soiled clothes. With its right arm extending, the big figure grabs her tightly, she screams in pain and fear. While with its left arm it shoot another round of bullets in the lying man’s head, rendering it to a soft splashed pulp of no particular shape.
Then it breaks her legs with one swift motion, she loudly screams in pain, and cries.
**“Don’t be afraid... Hadiya. You are safe now. We are going home.”** Said it with gentle words and a calming voice. Starting with big leaps backwards to the opening in the ceiling.
Only the white noise of the flushing waters remain, the mess gets washed away in the dark.
