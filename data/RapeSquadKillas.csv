I'd like to apologize to the hosts (especially Lefty) and the viewers. I can't even remember the last time I got that drunk and to be honest I didn't even remember much of the podcast the next day. This in no way excuses my actions. I clearly ruined the show for many viewers.

I'm especially disappointed in myself since I'd long been recognized as a fairly popular guest and it seems I've heavily sullied my pka reputation. 

Regardless, I thought I'd take this opportunity to say that I apologize and, if the hosts ever choose to have to come back, this type of thing will never happen again. Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1htvwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1htvwp/apology_for_pka140/,

Fill it out [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11J3WgoncV0-_iv57Lt3xIwcVowFVEeOC-2BsbJ35fSc/viewform).

It wasn't possible at the time because of arranged guests but now seems like a good time to get this in place, given PKA is 4 days away and IIRC he mentioned this briefly in 138 so the idea is possible.

***The Rules -***

**Woody -** When he comes up with a new topic or mentions his tech equipment. And when he mentions his Netflix sponsorship and/or any other advertising on PKA. Oh, and when his Microsoft fanboy-ism shows (He'll not like that haha).

**Kyle -** His showing of wealth and interest in younger girls and guns. Oh and when he mentions Wet Platinum or opposes competitor brands like KY or (Woody's Favorite) AstroGlide. 

**Jordie -** Jordie's love of Hitler (popular in old episodes) and lets throw in trucks too as well as when he says some absurd sexual term or reference. Add to that when he claims to be knowledgeable on a subject and tries to show facts.


**Lefty -** When he uses sophisticated vocabulary or goes on a small rant about politics or something of that nature, as well as the obvious racist banter.

**Woody &amp; Kyle -** When those two mention Reddit one drink, double the serving if they mention this Sub in particular or Woody asks a question from /r/AskReddit.

We can add to this list over time of course, just suggest below and I'll edit them in. Just gotta make sure Woody has the full list ready before the show starts.

***Drink Requirements -***

**Jordie** *must* drink the same beverage as before, the straight hard liquor (Dr. McGilicutties Intense Vanilla Peach Snaps IIRC) that fucked him up hard the last time and led to a great show. 

**Woody** can get off easy with his bitch drinks (I love ya, Woody but Mike's Hard Lemonade and Strawberry Daiquiris, really?). 

**Kyle and Lefty** are free to pick whatever they want, although I think Kyle is a softy too. Oh but let's see if we could get Lefty to drink some potentially racist named Brand of alcohol, if that's possible like White Russian ;)

Let's get this thing kicking, we haven't had a drinking Episode in over 115 shows and I could see this going well.

Huh, two successful posts here in one day. I feel right at home here, y'know I love you guys &lt;3 haha.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,1372109526.0,,,True,t3_1gzs4r,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1gzs4r/lets_make_episode_139140_a_drinking_special/,

I also think we all know how much time, money, and effort woody puts into the show. 

Everyone blames him when something with the show goes wrong, but don't mention how many times the show has happened thanks to woody. He even did two shows on vacation. In my opinion, they turned out great.

He mentioned that Kyle, Lefty, and Wings get a ton of love in the subreddit, which is true. Although lefty might not enjoy the love he gets. 

I think the reason why woody doesn't get as much love is the fact that he doesn't have moments in pka that compare to ""Im down cow"" or ""death to America."" Wings is outspoken and has a unique viewpoint on life. Kyle is very quick witted and has a great sense of humor. Lefty is similar in this manner, but Lefty can really jump into a serious discussion about issues and e makes a lot of sense. 

But let's not forget what woody brings to the table, he is very funny, and really helps the flow o the show. He has some awesome stories as well. Woody is consistantly funny and entertaining, which few people can claim to be.

I think the reason he doesn't get as much love in the subreddit is actually quite simple. Wings has a plethora of quotes to make easy references to, and Lefty posts pictures of his klan outings all the time on the klan's social media site, and many people enjoy reporting them here. Woody is the one that people blame when the show has any problems, and the people that like him don't speak up, while the haters always do.

Anyway, I just wanted to point out the integral role that woody plays in the show. Every ""great"" pka episode has woody in it. Famous moments from the show are often started by woody. Think about it. Woody talked about the show selling out, the. Kyle made a joke about al quaeda, then Lefty dropped the infamous quote; ""death to America.""  Woody started the topic in which wings chose to have sex with a cow, within seconds of woody asking the question. Woody is the reason that pka is great.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1j8j78,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1j8j78/woody_is_under_appreciated/,

I thought I would try this out and see if people liked it or not. It required ~15 hours of work over the past 3 days. If liked enough I'll work through the night next time, I also will be more thorough and have a couple ideas to improve this. Also, suggestions on how to improve this and things I missed are appreciated.

*The facts are true but take some of he reporting with a pinch of salt, it's clearly a pro Amanda website but it was one of the best summaries of the case I could find.


Here I'll give more in depth analysis of certain things that I deem worthy, upon request I can do the same on other topics.

**Jodi Arias**

Facts Listed Off:

* Mistrial: True
* Guilty: True
* Stabbed: 27 (or 29) not 19
* Shot: True
* Choked: Indeterminate, different news sources report differently
* California: Born and Raised. Murder was in Mesa Arizona
* Arias more overall coverage than Boston Bombings: [True](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=Boston+Bombings#q=Jodi%20Arias%2C%20Boston%20Bombing&amp;cmpt=q)

According to [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/us/mistrial-declared-in-penalty-phase-of-jodi-ariass-murder-trial.html) The facts are as follows:

* Jurors took 15 hours to find Arias **guilty**
* Jurors took 3 hours to deem her eligible for the death penalty
* Jurors could not decide the punishment 
* Judge had no option but to call **mistrial** in penalty phase of trial
* The guilty verdict will remain.

According to [The Associated Press](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/steps-jodi-arias-case-19245931) the way forward involves:

* Finding new jurors.
* Taking death of the table and giving her life.

Prosecution isn't ready to take death off the table just yet.

""Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery issued a statement Thursday saying: 'As of this point in time ... we will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase.'""

Side note: [Amanda - Retried in Italy: Scared to go to Italy](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/06/justice/amanda-knox-interview) 

**Boston Bombings**

* Boston Bombing had higher high than Arias Trial: [False](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=Boston+Bombings#q=Jodi%20Arias%2C%20Boston%20Bombing&amp;cmpt=q)
* Info Everyone Wants to know: [Debatable](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/22/man-fatally-shot-by-fbi-agent-in-florida/)
* Attacked agents with knife: [Maybe \(Leaning False, two agents reneged on their statement about him attacking the agent with the knife.\)](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/22/man-fatally-shot-by-fbi-agent-in-florida/)

**Shady Game Dealings**

Firstly: 1 USD = 1.02 AUD

Not really shady but with regards to price points:

60 2006 USD = 69.2 2013 USD

[Recently it was predicted that there would be a base  price increase for Next Gen](http://metro.co.uk/2013/04/03/publishers-back-price-increase-for-next-gen-games-says-gamestop-3580829/)

I have over 30 episodes with almost 4 hours of content for you to feast your eyes on.

Here is the most recent episode (uploaded today): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIj3vyfn80M

Here is the playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCD508B735D9243B7

I had recently taken a break from animating for focus on University work, but now I'm back for the summer so you can look forward to more animations. So be sure to subscribe to my channel if you enjoy the animations.

If you have any recommendations, I'd really appreciate it, especially if you have an episode number and time.

It's a relevant, helpful and professional piece of work. He concisely conveys his points to us in a logical and (have to use this word again) professional manner.

Contrast this with Wings latest commentary (not the sob-story one). The ""Bullshit news"" is a rambling, non-nonsensical collation of ideas, seemingly having no logical progression of thought. It's unprofessional and downright amateurish.  

That's the key to Woodys success: professionalism and hardwork, traits that appear to be lacking across the board on Wing's channel.

This guy is rich as fuck,

known as FPS McDuck.

His face is not known

What would we do if shown?

Destroys public restrooms,

Left behind are just toxic fumes.

Fucks bitches left and right,

Shootin every enemy in sight.



(Refrain)

RapeSquasKillas!

We get into your house,

we mug you and your spouse.

RapeSquadKillas!

we are ones to be feared,

so rise up and get geared.



(Verse 2)

Watch out it's WingsOfRedemption,

doesn't even need a mention.

though he lost a 1v1

Don't try talking 'bout it son

Stay away from his truck,

Else he'll leave you in muck.

He'll throw dirt in your eyes,

Shotgun shell to your thighs



(Refrain)



(Verse 3)

Newly acquired title of Grand Dragon,

Stacked corpses in the KKK wagon.

This is the Head Nazi,

It can only be Lefty.

His bottom half is a secret

But you know he ain't midget

Long words to which he is accustom,

black men can begin to trust him.



(Refrain)



(Verse 4)

The one dealing the cards,

the king of the fucknards.

For him ladies will whine,

and that magnificent hairline.

When you look into his eye

You just know: ""Blame this guy!""

2 Minutes late how could he,

let's just all unsub Woody...

Written by NithingBlade &amp; and I thank MyNameIsSteal because he improved the song in some parts to make it flow better.

The reason why it's called RapeSquadKillas theme song is 
because the song is about them(the hosts), not the subreddit itself.

Everyone is free to use it as long as my name is mentioned somewhere. 

My own take at it:

**WE HAVE MOVED TO /r/PKA**
**WE HAVE MOVED TO /r/PKA**

As you can see from the title, we are officially migrating to /r/PKA. We posted a poll to see what subreddit you guys wanted to move to. As of 08/04 10:34 EST, the results are [here](http://imgur.com/trGWLBi) and /r/PKA won by a good majority. Many of you guys contributed powerful reasons to move and we agree. We believe that moving to /r/PKA will expand our fan base, easier to find, and be more socially acceptable. After all, most of your parents probably think your going to turn into a serial killer when they see you browsing on Rape Squad Killas. 

This will hopefully ensure good timing so posts about PKA Episode 144 will stay on /r/RapeSquadKillas. Also it will give time to make adjustment to the new subreddit. 

Now, what will happen to /r/RapeSquadKillas? Well, we are going to make this subreddit ""restricted"". Meaning, no one will be able to post links/text. The reason for this is so that us mods won't have to moderate two subreddits that focus on PKA. Don't worry, you will still be able to browse this subreddit like an archive. All the previous posts will stay so that we can look back 100 years from now and see the hilarious photoshops and memes you guys have created. My personal favorite, [here](http://i.imgur.com/bKngirb.png). 

Lastly, I suggest everyone go on /r/PKA and read the [""Welcoming Thread""](http://www.reddit.com/r/PKA/comments/1jli92/welcome_to_the_new_official_painkiller_already/) because there are new changes to the rules and etc. I hope everybody is content and understanding of our big decision. 

May RSK rest forever in our hearts.

1. **Favela sign:**
when taking a dump your not in a state to worship god. the example of this is when the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was in the bathroom and a friend of his said asallamalaikum (muslim greeting meaning may peace be upon you). He did not reply and afterwords told the person that the reason for this was that he was not in a state in which he could mention god. 
So the whole dealio with that is that your in a unclean state (when excreting) in the bathroom, so having gods name in there is slightly disrespectful. 

2. **the left hand to greet:**
this is disrespectful for the reasons wings stated, but no one will want to kill you for it. they'll politely tell you why not to use that hand (unless they're an asshole). Wings' brothers situation for this is different as he's a soldier, so is most likely hated by the locals already (no offence, sorry). 

3. **the Taxi's:**  
*No Alcohol*-muslims dont drink so this is self explainatory, but seems a bit extreme not to allow guys in your cab for it, imo. (it not like you're drinking it or anything)  
*No Seeing eye animals* - its just dogs. Back in the day dogs where considered dirty in islam (and still kinda are) since they carried a lot of disease (still do in some middle eastern places and maybe other 3rd world countries). So they where almost like giant rats. 
but this isn't really an issue with domestic dogs and it seems the cabbies are just taking themselves too serious and being dickish imo. 


So yeah. Hope that cleared it up a little, we're not bad guys. We just have a few crazies in our group. Just like every other group of people. Fell free to ask questions. i'll answer to the best of my ability.

***Fuck Kyle.***

He called it off last week for coinciding with the 4th of July, and this week because he was feeling a bit down (and no, it's not related at all with MurkaDurkah, they've already dealt with that a LONG-ASS time ago).
I, and many people, told him not to do it this week because, in my opinion, not putting up a show at all is way better than putting up a bad show or a show none of the hosts would be comfortable with.
Right now, I'm watching PKA episode 85 in which a little over an hour in, they decide to call in the FNG podcast (never heard of it before, not even sure if it's still on) with ITryHard, WhiteBoy7thst, KPopp and DrChiz (who, coincidentally, is also a co-host of Lefty's show) and merged it into one big mega-podcast.
So i thought maybe we can cheer up Lefty by merging the two shows for this week!
Woody can invite DrChiz and Kaity (the show's producer), who are both on Google+ since Lefty's show also uses Hangouts like PKA does and just hangout together for this week's show.
If you're with it, please support this, if not, no problem, it's just another post/idea passing by.

Edit: I KNOW the tweets he said mentioned that he was just sick. I get that.
I thought maybe, just maybe, he might be a bit upset that he didn't deliver the show for two straight weeks, So ""IF"" he is, we'll cheer him up.

Plus the issue on the ""pity likes/support"": Yeah, it can have the opposite effect, and it does depend on the person who gets it.

1369961577.0,94,self.RapeSquadKillas,1fdhxi,Help wings; a marketers perspective,stuartiscool,142,48,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1fdhxi/help_wings_a_marketers_perspective/,"So I've been subscribed to Wings for a little over two years now and I feel that I may be in a position to offer advice. I’m 22 and doing my masters degree in marketing management at a top UK university. I know I’m young but I have worked in a number of high profile organisations ranging from private healthcare to household brands. I specialize in strategic marketing decisions and look to be a consultant in this area upon graduation.  I want to make it clear that I’m not hating on wings here.  This is criticism intended to help him.

I dont know if he reads this subreddit but if it gets his attention somehow it would be great.

Here are some fundamental principles that he needs to apply to his videos.

RULE 1; KEEP IT POSITIVE. He complains too much. We all know this and we say it in the comments. Wings knows this too, but he still does it. When people go to youtube they want entertainment. Listening to someone else's worries doesn’t fulfil this need.  Imagine you tuned into the new episode of Southpark and instead of the regular show, Matt and Trey decided to sit there and bitch about how they weren’t paid enough or the animation software was bullshit.  Its not entertaining and isn’t going to make anyone come back let alone subscribe to him. No matter what, do not complain.

RULE 2; DO NOT UPLOAD TWO VIDEOS PER DAY. I know why he is doing this, its because one video per day isnt generating enough income so he had to extend to two. However, this has meant that instead of one quality video, he offers two less than average videos. He needs to focus on quality over quantity. The results will not be immediate growth, but views will steadily grow over time as people recognise the enhanced quality.

RULE 3: WRITE OUT COMMENTARIES AND EDIT. A big factor that I notice about Wings is that he rambles. Topics begin with discussion of cops and end with discussions about what he's eating for lunch that week. He needs to write down what he intends to say and stick to it. He doesnt have to read it as a script but make sure there's a clear structure in place.  Topics are central to a good commentary and therefore cannot be second rate. 

RULE 4: GET BETTER AT EDITING. You know the biggest difference between the content on youtube 4 years ago and the content we see today? Its the video quality. Today’s videos are smooth and video quality is high. Wings' video quality is very high but how many times have you seen the video cut out mid sentence or start without a proper intro? His league play video today didn’t even show the ending. This is quality below some people that have less than 1,000 subs.  Wings needs to up his game.

RULE 5; PROVIDE LINKS TO OTHER VIDEOS AT THE END. This is something practically all other commentators are doing. People dont just watch one video, they binge on a few before getting bored and moving on to videos about cats and monkeys riding bicycles. He has to direct them to more of his videos else the customer will just find someone else to watch.

RULE 6; CONSISTENCY keep the content consistent. You want to do a series on guns, do it every week on the same day.  I can’t count the number of times wings has started a series and ended it without any explanation two weeks later. Consistency gives the viewers something to tune in for as well as provides a framework for what to talk about that day.   

FOR COD GAMEPLAYS
RULE 7; DON'T PLAY IN TEAMS.  I dont care about your KD, watching a game where the other team leaves is boring beyond words.  If you want to play in a team, let them get almost to the point of winning then go hardcore, but please no more playing with a team and sitting at the back of the map. I dont care about your KD i care about being entertained.

These are the basic rules for improving his videos. Now for what direction the channel should go in.

My opinion is that he should get a new audience. The views for gaming have plummeted and are not going to recover with the current audience. The gaming community has come and gone and unfortunately written him off from poor content, lack of engagement or his often controversial opinions.  All that is left are hardcore fans that tell him not to change and that they love his unfiltered opinions.  This actually isn’t helpful to him as these are the opinions of a very niche audience and doesn’t provide any opportunity for growth. What he needs now is to either wait for the next gen consoles and see what that brings, or pick an entirely new focus for the channel. My advice is the latter as the gaming audience isn’t working.

Change the focus onto truck talk. Create a new channel that is focused on cars and really go for it. This will put him in a new category on youtube with a new audience, potentially much bigger. Many current subs have showed interest in this and so he would be taking them and expanding into greener pastures. 

Ditch 'wingsofredemption' and stick with Jordie. Re-brand yourself.

You know how he was saying about how he couldnt get a truck to review on a regular basis? Do a few good and thorough reviews that show the positives of some trucks from a local dealer and i bet people will be lining round the block for you to show off their cars and promote their local dealerships. I seem to remember FPS Russia overloading a guys website in return for access to guns. It works, so get out there and ask some dealers.

In fact many young kids are buying their first cars at 16, why not test a bunch of cheaper cars and tell them which ones to look out for?

Furthermore, the truck audience arent 14 year old kids who care about drama, they are mature adults and wont be engaging in the bullshit that the cod community loves. This will be less stressful for him.

The most important thing now is to make change happen. If you dont do anything different, then how can you expect change to happen? Without making a change he will be forever clinging onto a channel with depleting views and an audience that has run out of enthusiasm. Change does not happen with wishful thinking, it only happens with action.  

EDIT: Wow thanks to whoever bought me reddit gold! I think its great that so many people in the comments are such loyal supporters of wings.  The overwhelming messages from you all is very clear that we all want the best for him.

I have some other ideas such as Bath Salts, Shrooms, Wipits, or even Synthetic Heroine.

I wanted the fumes to reach the hot water heater in a fiery explosion but the group overrode me and said it should be simply breathing the fumes.

At about 32 minutes into the show Wings arrives with no idea that we've been pretending he's dead while he slept.  Kyle was brilliant with, ""OMG, how long have you been unconscious?""

Without even knowing Wings was playing along when he replied, ""Umm, about 12 hours.""

After the show ended Wings tweeted that he was going out to work on the desk.  I think my favorite part was that Keemstar ran with it as a drama alert and tried to make me look bad.  We have Burnsy on for one night and he falls for our troll.  #KeemIsASucker",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1e532h,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1e532h/rip_wings/,

All joking aside, he has the necessary vocabulary, charisma, and intelligence to really make an A grade channel. I feel if he were to not do the goofy kind of voice thing that seems forced, even if its not, on game videos, it would be taken ALOT more seriously. I mean I love him in PKA, he's a great source of knowledge at some issues, and when he does not know something or doesn't have an opinion on it, he says so! That quality in modern day is rare. Plus his voice is that of a professional announcer. When I hear him spouting knowledge at the boys, I just think about how much better his channel could become if he did those animation videos kind of thing where it discusses a certain thing happening in modern day. Similar to Philip Defranco except more focused on one topic. 

I mean can you imagine if he got the same amount of help everyone has been offering wings? Lefty is too humble to accept this kind of credit, but credit should be given where credit is earned. He seems like a great guy, smart, intelligent, isn't arrogant, and has an amazing radio voice.

Everyone here knows he is depressed and I can't help but feel all the hate comments he gets on his channel is part of the reason, so I came up with an idea to brighten his comments section up. What if everyone who reads this goes to his channel just three times a day and leaves a nice comment on whatever his most recent video is, and also marks the nasty comments as spam.

If everyone who read this did it three times a day that could be 300 more nice comments on his videos per day, and if we are all marking the nasty comments as spam, hopefully wings won't see most of them.

If someone walks in your room now and sees that you are on a page called ""Rape Squad Killas"" what are they going to think?

Us mods have been discussing and thinking and we have come to the conclusion of migrating to /r/painkilleralready

We wanted to ask the community here what their opionion is. The Rape Squad Killas was a one off joke and /r/painkilleralready would be better since it is a lot more relevant to the show and more socially acceptable.

[I'm also linking to a poll that I would like you guys to fill out. Just a simple yes or no on moving subs.](http://poll.pollcode.com/px87p)

The look and feel of the sub would be even better since /u/FrictionPistol has been added as a mod to the new sub and has been busting his ass on making the sub look great.

The only negatives to this decision is that we have just earned 5k subs here and we would have to start again, but this can be countered by things like shoutouts or mentions from the show.

This has left us stumped, none of us have any knowledge of this show and no one has found it. A thread last night (now removed) tried to find it to no avail. 

We found Woody's Twitch and low-and-behold [Episode 20](http://www.twitch.tv/woodysgamertag/b/269393978) was 8 hours long. I took the liberty of listening to it to find out if it was true however 2 hours in they all go off to play MW2 and the next 6 hours is just nothing, no video/audio. Go and listen to it too if you want but you'll only leave disappointed.

Woody has told us multiple times that [Episode 100](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=painkiller+already+100&amp;oq=painkiller+already+100&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..35i39j0.862112.866558.0.866778.11.11.0.0.0.0.150.911.10j1.11.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.jkQ74THZ1_w) was an 8-hour show in total but on his Channel it's only [1:37:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxMhGwvT-3E) and [4:24:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3OvGEYQGyE) on Jordie's. What's odd is that at the end of Jordie's show, he says ""Okay guys that's the Stream, over and out."" and that's it so it makes me think they were in the Skype Call for 8 hours but only recorded half. I'll link the time frame [here, 4:24:00](http://youtu.be/c3OvGEYQGyE?t=4h24m) for verification.

I went and scanned through the entire [PKA Playlist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCGzsMd4ChI) and the longest Episodes available to us are Episodes [85](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ecmvhpgpZE), [43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNZRwsUya60), as recently as [131](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCGzsMd4ChI) and [71](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-JRaCFe1Ho), all spanning over 5 hours long. I'm not exactly sure why Woody thinks he's done an 8 hour Show but aside from 100, which went to shit and is only half that we've not even been close to 8 hours in one week.

**TL;DR -** 

* **Episode 20 is not 8 hours long, only 2 with 6 hours of silence.**

* **Episode 100 might have been over 8 hours but Jordie ends his Show at 4 so we've no idea.**

* **The longest Episodes available to us currently are (in order) 85, 43 ,131 &amp; 71 but none even close to 8 hours yet.**

Hopefully Woody sees this and sorts something out. Some of these have been used on the show before and some are my ideas. 

Feel Free to add your own too.

Additionally Lefty also raises some possible solutions such as mandatory sterilization of certain ""weaker"" populations.
* World War 2 Wednesday - Lefty embarks on a trip down memory lane and shares his favorite moments from World War 2. Even experienced PKA listeners may be surprised (maybe not **that** surprised) to hear that Lefty's grandfather actually fought on the nazi side during 1941-43. Lefty comes to the conclusion that the blood flowing through his vains is 25% nazi, but that his mind is 110% nazi (Lefty claims that correct math is a ""n*gger activity"")
* Segregation Saturday - Lefty tries to justify the need for segregation in modern societies. He dreams about an America like it was 100 years ago.
* Slave Sunday - Lefty utilizes his nazi propaganda in the style of his own idol, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, to justify the need for free labor in todays America. He specifically points out a certain race as the perfect match.

There! Please, come up with your own ideas that would perfectly fit Lefty's repulsive nazi agenda!",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1hkd4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1hkd4k/segregation_saturday_master_race_monday_slave/,

~~Lefty asked (I hope it was the real him!) if I could post a full AMA in the original post (http://en.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1htx25/ama_request_rockon1m1/). So here it is!~~

**I had not idea that Lefty had not reddit, I saw the author as a moderator and assumed it was him. My bad! #Trolled. But now that its up, feel free to ask anything**  
  
For those of you curious of how the audio of PKA 140 was synced I have posted a ""speed editing"" video as a tribute to PKA (http://goo.gl/9Hiif). It was pretty weird watching their mouths move for 6+ hours ROFL.  
  
1m1 !  
  
    
---------------------------------------------------  
    
  
  
As background, I have put below the original question &amp; answers below:
  
**Original Questions by  /u/kingjames101**
  
*1 How much has PKA benefited you?*  
*2 Do you think it was worth the cost of advertising?*  
*3 How do you like being a meme within the PKA community?*  
  
**My Original Response**
  
First of all, thank you so much to all of you that have supported me. It is overwhelming. 
  
**1.**  
*A.* A lot. 

*B.* I went from being unknown to being slightly more recognized. Even in random videos (like Amazingfilms247). As a result, the RockOn1m1 Squad/Gang/Band has swelled in number and is continuing to thrive.  
  
*C.* I use YouTube as a scapegoat. I love making entertaining content and my happiness is directly correlated to the comments and reactions you guys give me. **When I am having a tough day in the office and I see that blue light shine on my Samsung Galaxy (indicating there is inbox), it makes me happy to think that it could be a new subscriber/comment/etc. I receive all comments on my mobile. That is what makes YouTube amazing. You guys.**  
  
*D.* Not only this but the influx of positive support and kind comments just motivates me to keep improving my videos. Seriously, some of the comments are amazing. You guys are amazing.  
  

**2.**
This is a very subjective question. It was to me. I worked/saved up the money and rationalized the cons/pros. I'm almost 26, economically independent and am fully conscious that I will never reach the higher echelon of YouTube or even scratch the middle/lower end. I do YouTube for reason 1. C. and if I ever do get successful then all the better. I have tried to grow organically since the end of 2011 without spamming or other weird stuff and it has not worked. This way I managed to place my channel to a c. 200k-300k audience that I would have never reached without. Not only that but I sponsored a kick ass show which has always entertained me. 
  

**3.**
I love it almost as much as I love the way my channel smells! I honestly love it, I have even seen random memes/comments on other peoples videos (which have nothing to do with PKA crew xD)! I respond to all of them that I can. It makes laugh and smile how funny you guys can be.  
  
**I have even started a ""challenge"" in Twitter #RockOn1m1Giveaway for the best meme!** Feel free to submit yours! So if you think you are up to the challenge, submit your meme so we can all have a great time! For the avoidance of doubt, the meme challenge is not part of the giveaway. It is just for fun. The giveaway is an appreciation to subs and the winner will be selected end of July.  
  
**Here are some of your contenders should you think in participating:**

1375397189.0,58,self.RapeSquadKillas,1jiz7v,The possibility of Wings no longer being able to be on PKA?,BausMan408,99,41,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1jiz7v/the_possibility_of_wings_no_longer_being_able_to/,"So everybody who watches PKA knows about Wings' financial status, seeing as he has done little to nothing except complain about how he's running out of money for the last 10-15 PKA episodes. He's reaching into his savings every month to cover bills, and by his own estimates, he'll ""be flat broke by September"". So as the episodes go on, and as he continues to shoot down video ideas that two 1,000,000+ subscriber channels literally throw at his feet, it seems that PKA is rapidly reaching a stage where Wings could be forced off of the show. Not by the other co-hosts, but by his ISP. Come September/October-ish, Wings may not be able to afford the internet. No internet = no Wings on PKA. 

Now I’m sure that Wings stretches the truth with money, just like he does with everything else (“I made two girls nut by kissing them…”), and I’m sure that if it ever came to that point, the Internet would be the last thing to go, because YouTube his only form of income, but like I previously said, there is a chance where Wings may no longer be able to be a part of the podcast.  IMHO Wings used to be a big part of the show, but lately he’s been a drain on it. It’s no longer as fun to watch because Wings will complain about YouTube/Money/Cops/His weight at the drop of a hat, and sometimes interrupts a topic to do so. So his departure from the show wouldn't affect me too much, TBH, I wouldn't mind a new host at all. 

Opinions? Sorry for the wall of text.

He is also saying he wants to use that as an excuse to file for disability(I disagree with that). As someone who has had serious nerve damage to my lower back from a football injury...I know his injury is not as irreparable as he makes it out to be. There are many different procedures that can be done based on the extent of damage that can drastically improve his quality of life. A couple of examples of things he can look into are surgeries that can remove pressure from the nerve and they can even graft a nerve in place of the damaged one(s). There are many other options. The two I listed are the ones I have had done personally. Just because nerves cannot be regenerated doesn't mean there aren't any ""workarounds"". It took me several different doctors to find one willing to help...He may need to shop around outside of SC. 

Wings has the typically mindset of many morbidly obese people...they latch on to something they see as a crippling disability that will stop them from ever loosing any weight. They feel as if their situation is unique and no one else can understand. 

He needs to realize that he has a whole lot more resources at his disposal than the average person. He is actually ahead of the game in that respect. He just has to make the decision to do whatever it takes. Heck, I bet if he wanted to, he could even drum up enough support to get on one of those ""extreme weightloss"" tv shows.

However, assuming he did want to be, here are some reasons why he should not be a regular host.

* He talked a **lot**. This isn't a problem when you are a guest, in fact the biggest problem is when a guest just listens along with the rest of us. The problem is when that person that talks a lot becomes reoccurring. I think Boogie actually talked for more than anyone that PKA and by the end I was starting to find it a little annoying. Woody had to say ""Let me say this"" a few times.

* He did not stay on topic. It felt like he wanted to talk to Wings about weight and nothing else and changed back to that topic multiple times. I would say at least half of the show seemed to be Boogie talking to Wings. I did enjoy this PKA and even enjoyed the Boogie/Wings conversation but I don't want to hear it every week. 

* It seemed like anything that was a bit on the edge that anyone said (usually Wings), he took an issue to. Now I'm assuming that cause he was a guest, he wasn't making a huge deal about it and was just making comment but if he became a host, I feel like he would try to censor some of it. 

* This is similar to the above point but I just can't imagine Boogie responding to some of the PKA questions very well. I can't see him explaining how he would go about murdering someone and getting away with it or what crime he would commit if he could get away with anything. He would always take the easy way out of answering.

* Too many hosts. My favourite PKAs tend to be Woody, Wings and Kyle. I don't especially like Lefty but he hasn't changed too much about the show, he just adds in his own opinions on stuff. The reason I like it is they all seem to have equal input. We barely heard from Kyle. If that hadn't been so noticeable though, I bet people would've been saying we hardly heard from Lefty either, Boogie just took over and made it the Wings and Boogie show.

This is my idea though, the Wings and Boogie show should be a thing. I don't think it should be podcast as it tended to get quite repetitive towards the end but they should do a video together once a week or something on either of their youtube channels. I see no reason why Boogie would do PKA over this as he didn't really have much chemistry between him and Kyle, Woody or Lefty and often shut them out of the conversation. If he is talking about his weight problems but saying ""Skinny people always comment but they don't understand"" or something like that, there is no way for the other 3 to have any input.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1ggcd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1ggcd4/why_boogie_should_not_become_a_regular_host_or/,

And all the comments are ""Yeah! I'd totally watch that!"" But nothing ever happens. We have 4 great, hilarious, incredible hosts (except Woody. Just kidding). And they would be hilarious together. ANY game they play I would love to watch. Here's some ideas.

Borderlands 2- Woody loves this game. The game is meant to be played with 4 people all using a different type of character. I would watch this the whole way through.

Payday 2- This game is just funny to watch people play. I can imagine it would result in constant chanting of ""RAPE SQUAD KILLAS!"" As Kyle robs a bank. There was a post earlier explaining this.

Those are just two games I know would do great.

Now how can this happen? I think Kyle would want his gaming channel ready before any of this is considered. But I could see them just playing together and uploading each part to their individual channels. But maybe if these get really popular then there could be a whole channel dedicated to PKA lets plays?  This is looking ahead of course.

The point of this post is to get Woody to finally act on this. People have wanted PKA Let's Plays for awhile and I want to see it happen. There would be so many great and memorable moments that happen along the way.

Similar to most of you, I've watched all the PKA's and laughed out loud at the comedic geniuses of Woody, Kyle, Wings, and the infamous racist Lefty.

The mods and I will be working hard to change up the subreddit to make it more enjoyable and organized for you all. As you can see above, Woody added a classy, new banner to the subreddit. Along with that, SpongederpSquarefap and I will try to create image flairs for the subreddit. Regarding rules and such, they are under construction. Until then, I ask redditors to please refrain from making guest threads. For example, ""I want Phillip DeFranco as a guest"" Don't worry, I'm sure the PKA gang has seen your requests.

Lastly, I will post an official weekly ""PKA Episode _ Thread"" on Saturday mornings. Inside, I'll link the episode and give info on who the guests is and etc. This thread will be the central place where you can link each other to parts that you thought were hilarious during the episode. Also, redditors can link each other to videos that the Woody and the gang watched in the episode. For example, the crazy World Star Hip Hop Vids. 

Not only will this thread organize the subreddit but it'll be a central interactive thread where we can laugh together.

Until then, Sayonara and #RIPWings - Yellohh

1375302392.0,43,self.RapeSquadKillas,1jg1db,My appreciation for Woody. (i know not technically PKA but still his stuff in PKA helped me to :D ),ImbaNub,60,17,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1jg1db/my_appreciation_for_woody_i_know_not_technically/,"I first started watching woody in late MW2 stage, which was pretty early but still a long time ago didnt really watch much of his but i was subbed. I had troubles as usual around that time to do with school and all stuff around leading up to my GSCE's (English exams you do and if you fail you fuck up life).  

To make my stress worse i had tourettes which made me constantly Grunt and roll my eyes so i was looking as far up as possible and only a small part of my pupil could be seen, which then transferred later into me quickly jolting my head forward, it was horrible, i knew everyone was watching and judging and i was always very awkward. also another side of my tourettes was that i got extremely ""Obsessed"" with many things i did, such as certain games and shows for example to the point at which it would get withdrawal symptoms if i did not do the activity. 

And i did get bullied and taunted for it, alot.

No one wanted to be associated with me.

it was horrible.

fast forward a few years and have done my GCSE's and i felt i did terribly. After doing them i felt horrible as if my life was over. As we finished early in June that year due to the exams ending around that time, English students have around 2 months extra holiday that year, however it was to be the worst few months of my life.

This was the year 2011, it was the sunny summer holidays, and i was miserable, i hated everything, i lost contact with my friends due to mostly me never leaving my room, my dog and bet friend had died in May earlier that year so i was already down due to that. my parents grew ever more worried about me and took me to the doctors where i was diagnosed with depression.

For those who have never had depression or any form of deep ""Sadness"" it is horrific, but to summarize i can feel i can put it into one sentence; Imagine waking up every single morning and finding no reason to get out of bed, just lye there and think about how shit everything is, with no hope or future.

Suicide went through my head, but i felt it would make my family even more ashamed of me.
 
Then Woody uploaded this video;

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMgDSboZ6Ww&amp;list=FLHM16vGJ6Yt6R78-8R0TbQw

Woody and Tourettes syndrome.

I found out he had it similar to me, but he was at this demi-god state of achievement, he had an amazing family, awsome kids and wife. but how i thought to myself, he had this shameful neurological disease.

i began watching more and more of his videos, and thought this guy was awesome, i started to watch his Mail Monday videos and soon learned of this podcast he had going on called ""Painkiller Already"", PKA, i watched every single episode, these 3 (Soon to be 4) hilarious guys and a brilliant guest every week talking about games and funny news stories made my week exiting, they made me feel as if i had something to look forward to every week. it was amazing.
 
Although it sounded pathetic, theses guys made me feel as if i had friends in my life. they made me happy.

After a few weeks of watching PKA my parents noticed a change in me. i was still miserable but i now had more vigor in my speech.

The day my results came in i was relieved, i had passed them all and got into the collage i wanted, but still had not spoken to anyone except my family for several months.

But it was better, i got into collage, had my family and best of all, i had Woody and the PKA crew.

My depression situation got gradually better over the next few months and i made sure to watch every video Woody posted, as well as PKA. :)

Woody made me happy, he was more than an idol to me, he was a role model. he could do nothing wrong his advise was wise and his humor was great, and he had a good life. :)

The only thing i find sad is that i think he will never hear my story, not as so he will recognise me but so he new that he helped someone in need and made them truly happy.

So Woody, Matt, if you read this.
know you are a good man.


Joe.

We all know Wings and Kyle love movies so there'd probably be no problem there. I don't know about Woody though.

So if I was high king of Painkiller Alreadard this is how it would be:
At the end of the show they tell us what movie they'll be talking about next week, so we get a week to acquire and watch the movie. At the next show they go ""around the table"" and all give their opinion of the movie. I doubt they would spend too much time on this.

The problem with this is that the guest might not have anything to add to the conversation, unless he actually by some lucky coincidence had already seen the movie. This could be countered by picking guest a week in advance and preparing them for the show but I doubt that is an  option.

TL;DR : My suggestion is that they talk more about movies.

1368738755.0,40,self.RapeSquadKillas,1eh4te,The truth about FPSKyle. Well. Just something that would make a cool story IMO,HaydenSI,45,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1eh4te/the_truth_about_fpskyle_well_just_something_that/,"What if and just use your imagination here. We all have it wrong. What is FPSKyle  isn't FPSrussia.  What if FPSrussia is FPSKyle.  

Russia (Dmetri) was born in Russia in a small town that became war ridden after WWII. His father was a industrial worker for most of his life until he was forced to fight in the war. He fought for 5 long years and worked his way up the ranks.   He was known for his brutal assassinations of his enemies that made regular men shudder in fear. By this time Russia was only 12 and the military was loosing the war. So the military decided to start making kids fight.  Russia's dad heard of this and refused to make his son fight in this brutal war. No 12 year old should see the things he saw. Surely that would ruin a child. He went to his commanding officer and begged but to no avail.  So with no other choice they fled to America. 

Russia's dad contacted the us military and offered to exchange secrets for protection. The us agreed and gave them all fake identities as farmers in Georgia. They made them learn to speak with a perfect English accent and eventually down the road they realized how valuable of an asset Russia's father would be and welcomed him and the CIA's newest agent further protecting their identities.   

Long since has the war passed so Russia decided to come out of hiding. With his CIA connections he got access to all sorts of weapons and artillery. Plus what's cooler? Seeing a bad ass American blow shit up or a crazy Russian blow shit up?   It was a smart business move.  

But out of fear Russia still hides his identity as Kyle the best he can in case the Russian military ever decide to come after him he can change his appearance and pretend to be the American born and raised farm boy from Georgia. 


This all sounds crazy but when you think about it, it's highly plausible. Or just a cool story to tell.

But he is much more then that. He baits the police, flipping them the bird and riding wheelies in front of them to get them to chase him. 


EDIT: The youtube PKA 28 is wrong, this is the ""original"" one with just Woody\Wings\Kyle - Estimated time is between 42-43 minutes in. Since this isn't a youtube link (no monitary value given to Woody\Wings's channels) I'm sorry if it breaks the rules, but I think it puts the story into context for the readers: http://ia700405.us.archive.org/18/items/PainkillerAlready/pka-028.mp3


A ""Best Of"" Ghost Rider video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc-J53XKF_k
Trollin' the police: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv31MKnK6ts

The logic behind my thinking of Woody being the Ghost rider: In many of PKA's Woody talks about how he has never gotten a moving violation (speeding ticket) in his life. He also talks about the motorcycles he has had in the past. Now around the time that Woody stopped riding motorcycles, this ""Ghost Rider"" person appears in Europe. Although the fact that one is in Europe and one is on the eastern seaboard of the US is in question, one tantalizing thing still remains to be said. The way Woody says to the ground in PKA 28 ""Hey Wings do you know about Ghost Rider? Kyle knows who I'm talking about."" And the way Kyle laugh CLEARLY gives it away as an inside joke between Woody and himself. Being Kyle knows things about Woody that most people don't. Wouldn't Kyle be one of the few people Woody would tell about his time as said ""Ghost Rider""?

While I expect this from ""TDTMNBN"", it really disappointed me to see Blade join in with the name calling. It seems over the past few months with the growing influence of ""TDTMNBN"" on Blade that he had already been growing apart from the PKA crew, so this may have simply been the straw that broke the camels back. So do you guys think they will ever make up, or will we no longer have the squirrelist back on the show?

It got mixed reviews, some people thought I was begging for attention, others applauded me for making a great video. 

I notice at one point a ""Woodysgamertag"" left a comment on my video. I wasn't expecting this at the slightest. I wanted to make an impact, and take that chance in a clever and creative way. When I saw that he commented, yeah of course I was excited. My reaction wasn't at all fanboyish. My reaction was ""I set a goal, I took a long shot, and I achieved it. I just proved to myself, if I put my mind to it, and I at least try. I can achieve incredible things."" Honestly that was the first thought that came into my mind. I felt because I got such an unexpected positive response, I could achieve anything if I work for it. (HERE IS HIS COMMENT)
http://gyazo.com/1476693572538a2a6f3bdf459db5c9fb

FAST FORWARD&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I tweet Woody my skype. about 15 minutes later, I get a skype request from his personal skype account. I send him a message of appreciation for his interest in me. No reply. The next day I told him that I'll get back on him with the exact details of the commentary, but I needed a bit of time to organize notes, and make sure I could put on the best performance I could. No reply. I figured he was at Joe's house. I didn't want to interrupt his training, so if he didn't reply, I was fine. I'm no crazy fanboy, I like to carry myself in the most professional way possible on my channel. 

A week goes by and still no response. He's back home by now. I sent him one more message, and a tweet saying to check his messages. So here's where I'm at:

I have this horrible feeling in my stomach I'm being played by some internet troll lol. I believe if Woody was busy, He'd have replied to me by now, and I'm honestly a bit embarrassed if I did get played. I'll link the video right here, you guys can look at all that HTML stuff and see if it was the real woody, or some guy linking to his channel somehow with a fake account. I'm a bit upset that this could really be a possibility...

Foreword- Used with a male masturbator (Pocket *****), I wanted it to be as controlled as possible. I tried to make it as objective as I could. Don't expect a college-level lab report, haters. 
Independent Variable- Wet Platinum vs. KY Liquid.
Dependent Variables- Claims made by FPS Kyle- See Below
Control- See Foreword


**The Big Question**

*Does it really stay wet longer?*
Yes. After sufficient lubrication was applied, I did not have to reapply during the approximate 30 minute time. With KY, I would have to reapply about every 15 minutes.

*Does it get sticky when rubbed between fingers?*
No. I believe this is attributed to the silicone base, compared to the water base of KY Liquid.

*Is the cleanup easy?*
Yes, I used toilet paper to remove excess from my man part, and a sock to remove excess from my inner thigh.

*Is it slippery on hardwood?*
I do not know, and likely will not test. Why? I don't have exposed hardwood in my house, and at $9.15 a bottle (amazon.com) I'm not about to try.

*Is it good for anal?*
I do not know. I don't have a girl handy to readily try and I'm not about to peg myself in the interest of science.

Afterword:
If I missed a claim, inform me and I'll test it... for science

**TL;DR** Yes, it stays wet longer",,True,nsfw,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1fzj8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1fzj8z/nsfwa_redditors_reviewcomparison_of_wet_platinum/,

But Wings has shown in the past that he doesn't exactly show respect to guests when he was talking about how much he hated cops with Jimmy Quinlan in PKA 129.  And Wings has made it perfectly clear that he doesn't like Game of Thrones whatsoever.  I'm actually really worried of him saying something not-so-polite to Mr. Nairn.  

I actually think that this will be Wings' big test for me.  If Mr. Nairn does indeed grace the PKA crew with his presence, then I'm counting on Wings to stay professional and polite.  Should he do something that is characteristic to Wings' not giving a fuck demeanor, then I'm gonna switch over to the replace Wings with Murka camp.  

I love Wings, I really do, and I want to see him succeed.  But, this would be my final straw.  Let's all hope.  I don't think any of us generally are hoping that Wings continues to crash and burn, but if he does continue to do so, there's nothing that we can do.  Again, let's just hope.

1368752150.0,26,self.RapeSquadKillas,1ehljr,My opinion and to why wings's channel is struggling.,HaydenSI,34,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1ehljr/my_opinion_and_to_why_wingss_channel_is_struggling/,"Let me start off by saying that I in no way shape or form hate wings.  I do not agree with how he handles him self when he is upset, but I have no hate for the guy. 

So.  Here is my detailed theory.  It may seem long but I think it's well worth the read. 

Wings has been on YouTube for close to what 5 years?  In that 5 years he has opened himself up to his viewers and let you know who he is.  They have seen his ups and downs most of his personality traits (especially if you follow him on twitter) and really gotten to know who the guy ,for the most part, is as a person. 


Now lets say you had a friend that you had known for 5 years.  When they are depressed (even though they may not say it aloud) you would know wouldn't you?   You would.  Or at least I do with my friends.  As someone who goes to YouTube for a laugh or some motivation or a pick me up I do not personally enjoy listening to someone talk when I can tell they are upset and do not want to be doing what they are doing.  You can just hear it In his voice and its kind of contagious.  

An example is music.  We all have those songs that for some reason just pick us up and some that just make us want to sit and dwell on our lives.  

It's the same with someone you watch on YouTube that you have any kind of admiration for.  Wings may think the majority if his viewers are children but there are a lot of people on YouTube that are adults.  Such as myself.  I'm 23 working full time and going to college. I don't have a mommy or daddy to help me nor do I have grants or scholarships. So I know how wings feel when he says he is hurting for money.  Trust me wings a lot of people go there.   But when I go to YouTube It's my escape. The same as it is for a lot of people and we don't want to listen to someone who is constantly depressed no matter how well you try to mask it we can just tell.  It at least some of us.   

We get it. You're over call of duty and YouTube.  You don't know what to do.   Hmmm maybe listen to your subs??  We may not be your ""customers"" but we are the reason you do or don't make money so why not give us what we want to an extent?   You don't like doing vlogs, even though that's what your fan base asks for.   Think of it like this.  What's worse. Busting your ass at a factory 8-10 hours a day or making less gameplay videos and more vlogs?  

You complaining as much as you do about your channel dying isn't helping you.  You can only get pity pussy for so long before you have to man up and do something about it to get that pussy. 

You don't need to release 3-5 videos a day for views.  What you need to do is pull yourself out of this hole you're in stop worrying so much about money (it's hard I know) and make 1-2 good videos a day.  

You wonder why you're doing worse now than before?  It's because people can tell you are depressed just by the way you speak and YouTube like I said is an escape for most people. Not a place to go and feel worse. 

Anyways I know he won't ever read this but I just wanted to share my thoughts.

The one thing that I'm surprised PKA has not added is an intro.

First off, by 21 regions they actually mean countries. Whoever said that they mean states is wrong.

So, the Xbox One will only work in 21 countries at launch. This is factual information from xbox.com: 

http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/pre-order-xbox-one/disclaimer

As you can see in the link I just posted, only half of Europe, Asia, South America etc. will be able to play Xbox One. Here is a tweet that confirms this fact:

https://twitter.com/XboxSupport1/statuses/344879674335305728

Also, some people may say that Xbox Live for Xbox One will soon be implemented in other countries and these are only temporary. Indeed, you may be right, but the 360 had a very similar history. The console was launched in 2005 and to this day it only has a handful of countries on its official list. I live in Romania (Eastern Europe) and to play on Xbox Live I had to make a UK account because my country wasn't on that list. But this trick will probably not work on Xbox One (check the tweet above).

So, Woody, I think people have a pretty valid reason to be pissed off and it's not just a matter of fanboyism. Again, I hope you don't take this as hate, because this was really not my intention.

Also, here's a related article about the developers of Witcher 3 (a game featured in the Xbox One conference) who can't play their own game on xbox in their own country:

**What is this/what is its application?**

A while a go I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1ffo9h/episode_search_idea_for_this_subreddit/), presenting my rough idea of a 'quick-search' for PKA episodes. I have made the basic table so that it can be filled by other users on this sub-reddit. A 'Guest' column has been added so that users can search for episodes by event and/ guest. I plan to continue updating the chart each week a new episode comes out.



**Below is a brief explanation of some decisions I made while making the table:**

* I chose not to include Lefty in the guests column as he is now considered a host. I did however, include Redneck, as he is no longer a host.
* I used a '-' to indicate that there were no significant guests featured in the episode.
* The grayed out part of the table at the bottom are episodes that have not yet happened. I simply put them there so that they can be easily filled in the following weeks.
* Commas have been used to separate guests and key events.



**A few notes if you would like to help complete this search:**

* Anybody with the link may edit the doc. Please be responsible and only add necessary information.
* Proof read the cells that have been filled and correct any mistakes. I filled a large amount of the guest column by listening to people's voices in the show, some may be wrong.
* When adding guests that have appeared in multiple episodes, please write their name exactly the same in all instances so that they will all show up when using Ctrl+F.
* Fill in gaps. i.e if you think there is a notable event missing, add it in. 
* Please remember that this is meant to be a simple search. Only add notable events, not every discussion topic of every episode.


Thankyou for any help in advance.

He could buy a lot of copies, but this brings up the issue if why would people buy the game from him.  Of course, there is the ""shady business"" idea, but I think he could make people have an incentive to buy his copies: he could sign them.  They'd be the special ""Woody 300"" copies or something, just give it a cheesy brand name + commercial.  This idea might have some flaws, but I'm curious wether the flaws would outlay the benefits.   Another option would be to have FPS mcduck could destroy them in a video.  Might cost a lot of money, but then again, it's FPS Mcduck.

This week wings was extremely proud of the fact that he figured out the ending of the show in season two when at that point in the shows creation the writers had no idea how it would end. Wings may have super human powers of prediction but not in this case sorry wings.

and repeated it in episode 144 like he just figured it out but I'm sure he forgot he was told**

Thank you.

But I'm here to say thank you for a different reason and that is because of the wonders PKA has done to me irl. Through countless quotes of inspiration and wisdom of Wings, the ""go get it"" attitude of Woody, the ""don't take shit from nobody"" teachings of Kyle and the thought provoking and forever racist words of Lefty.
These guys have helped change me as a person for the greater good and I hope the advice will serve me well.

I was a un popular guy.. Never having much friends or a social life XD but I found out that the ""popular"" (Not the most popular jerk like people but the sporty, straight A students) guys all LOVED PKA. So through all the inside jokes and countless break times of trying to get to know these guys I broke the social barrier and became best friends with them.
Since then I have joined the rugby team, got fit, been social, getting A's and a beautiful girlfriend who I love.

Thanks guys ;) Love ya (No homo)

It is very possible for over 5000 of us to collectively listen to all PKA's, take the time stamps of all of the correct times, and put them all in one thread and, when we think we have them all, eventually make the actual montage. Please discuss this topic as i think it is a great project for us all to do while we watch PKA.

We all know Kyles big secret, and that's why he's hesitant to appear on camera. But I feel Like PKA IRL could be a good ""coming out"" event for him'.
Picture this- Woody sets up a wide desk like the ones on Late night talk shows, use a green screen and display like some sort of landscape art from the most recent cod. Woody has enough audio equipment to make a Hollywood set look like an indy film, and he's a tech Guru.
This could be a pricy event, i understand that, so start a Chip in! I'd chip in a few bucks for this to happen.
And just do a normal show with high production value.
More ideas:
-Lineup Sub calls in advance. Guys who can talk and have decent audio equipment.
-hope comes on briefly (mayb.) No pervy motivations! just from the vids woody puts up and the praise he gives she seems like a very vibrant person who might have some witty insight to add to the conversation.
-Jackie as a guest.
-Get kyles Dad on. This would be awesome!
-Tmarts Mom on PKA.
-Some type of drinking competition at the end.
-And whatever else comes up!
I know i threw out a lot of ideas there, in hopes that at least a couple would work out!
I really hope this happens.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1dhnu4,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1dhnu4/real_life_pka_episode/,

""Your girlfriend's/wife's brain is switched with your mom's. You have to have sex with one of them to switch their brains/bodies back. Who do you have sex with?""

I think this question is awesome already, and I really hope that they use it next week, but I think that everyone will easily choose to have sex with their girlfriend in their mom's body, so I have a suggestion to make it a little more interesting. I think that it should be that you can sleep with your mom in your girlfriend's body or sleep with your girlfriend in your mom's body, but your dad, who is unaware of the body swap, walks in on you having sex with your mom's body.

I just thought I would throw this out there in case one of the hosts sees it, but either way, I hope they use some variation of the question, because the original question is hilarious as well.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1i49f8,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1i49f8/a_suggestion_for_the_sex_with_wifegirlfriend_and/,

Anyways, I was just playing, when all of a sudden, my trailer started getting shot up. Must have been another one of gangster grandma's rival gangs. I got caught in the crossfire, was shot, and killed. Gangster Grandma also died valiantly that day. They must have had FMJ or something of that nature. 

Shortly after that, I saw a light. I went towards it, and all of a sudden I started seeing family members and friends. 'Yo pimps!' I said to them. Even Gangster Grandma was there! 'How in da fuck you get here granny?' Before I got an answer, I all of a sudden woke up. I was alive! It couldn't have been a dream, as my smashed controller was still there from earlier raging and bullet holes covered my wall. 

This has completely changed my philosophy on religion. I mean damn pimp, that had to be an act of god! And a merciful god at that, since even gangster grandma was there! Now I know I've hated on god and Christians before, but I'm done with that bullshit. I'm a Christ follower now, playa!""

Woody said that he would take care of it for future episodes, but to have an increased volume for all of the recent episodes, try this.

If you have VLC Media Player, open it. If you do not have it, I recommend downloading it [here](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) as it is probably the best media player available. Once opened, click Media at the top, and then Open Network Streak. Alternatively, press Control + N when in VLC. Then, go to Youtube and copy the URL of the PKA you want to download, and then paste it where it says ""Please enter a network URL."" It may take a little bit to load. Once you can view it, you can turn up the volume to 200% in the bottom right corner which allows you to be able to hear everyone.

[Here is a video guide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQe3JxJHpxQ#at=58) showing you how to do it if that makes it easier.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,t3_1jrotr,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1jrotr/if_youre_having_trouble_with_low_volume_on_recent/,
