1372053304.0,183,self.breastfeeding,1gybxp,I just had an unusual breastfeeding experience... I nursed my cousin's baby. Anybody else ever nursed a baby that wasn't yours?,BanditTheFox,218,35,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1gybxp/i_just_had_an_unusual_breastfeeding_experience_i/,"So, I got a call from my cousin saying my other cousin (who gave birth five days ago) was horribly engorged, no milk was coming out, the baby wouldn't take the breast, they'd given him formula, and they were debating going to the hospital. I saw red flags all over this, and I'm really hoping she can stick with nursing, so I drove over to see what I could do to help. 

As soon as I got there, I prodded my cousin in the boob and it was literally rock hard-- I don't think I've personally ever been THAT engorged. I was handed the sleeping baby, and his mom left to grab some diapers. Well, the baby woke up, and started rooting and fussing, and squirming and whining, and she had been gone for five minutes. I knew he was about to get PISSED and then it'd be even harder to calm him down enough to nurse, especially under the circumstances. I joked to my aunt that if my cousin didn't get back soon, I was going to stick a boob in his mouth, and she said, ""if you still had milk, I'd say go for it."" (I guess she didn't know I was still nursing my almost 1 year old). 

So, after a few more minutes of fussing, I took him in the bedroom, pulled up my tshirt, and stuck a boob in his mouth. He latched perfect, and just gulped and gulped. Now, IN this room were: my sister, her five year old daughter, my one year old daughter, the cousin who had called me, her two teenage girls, and my engorged cousin's toddlers....and I'm just sitting there nursing this baby that isn't mine. The cousin who called me looked at me like I was out of my mind, haha, but when the baby's mom walked in, she was totally cool with it. 

My reasoning was that if we curbed his appetite a little bit, he might latch on to her. And sure enough, he did!! After he finished tanking up with her, we handed him off to be burped and I started helping my cousin figure out if any milk was coming out or not--- they'd been trying all day and hadn't seen any. Now, me and my cousin have NEVER had this kind of relationship, we see each other maybe five times a year at the kid's birthdays, or Thanksgiving. We occasionally text, but we aren't super close. And here I am, standing behind her, holding her big ol rock boobies, showing her how to milk herself, haha. I showed her how to manually express (she had been squeezing the nipple too far down), and then we set her up pumping, and she pumped almost three ounces right off the bat! 

Before I left, her boobs were SO much squishier, and I had her show me that she could hand express, just in case they got bad again. 

It was a surreal experience, but it felt very.... natural? Very primitive or something. Like we were a tribe, all of us girls sitting in a room figuring out how to feed a baby. 


I was a really odd, beautiful night, and I feel proud for being able to help her. You guys are pretty much the only people I could talk to about this without feeling like a weirdo, haha. Anybody else have any ""wet nurse/ teaching someone else to breastfeed"" stories?

***EDIT: I went to see her again today, to bring her my electric breastpump (so she could take a break from handpumping), and she was doing great! She still looked pretty full, but the baby was eating like a champ! She told me she really wants to do this, and she's not going to let anything get in her way. It totally warms my heart thinking about what an awesome bond she is building, one feeding at a time! :)",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,1372133975.0,,,True,t3_1gybxp,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1gybxp/i_just_had_an_unusual_breastfeeding_experience_i/,

But the other day we were out for hours, he was exhausted and desperate to nurse. So I found a semi-secluded bench in the mall and nursed him. 

Not two minutes later, two older women (60s) came over and sat down because they needed a break from walking. I was really nervous. 

One of the women noticed and immediately apologized for interrupting. I said, ""Oh no it's fine. He's just snacking.""

She replied, ""It is SO GREAT that you are breastfeeding. Evie, isn't that great? It is. In my day   women didn't do it as much, but now we know how important it is.

1367250036.0,118,self.breastfeeding,1dccp4,"Breastfeeding, why I quit, and the aftermath.",FlameEverlasting,133,15,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1dccp4/breastfeeding_why_i_quit_and_the_aftermath/,"Here is my story about breastfeeding.  It may be different from most people's experiences, and that's why I think it ought to be out there.

Had a baby.  Woo!  Breastfeeding?  Of course!  Why, this is easy!  Why do people bother buying formula?  Cue self righteousness.  

Four days after I had a baby,- four days of breastfeeding,- and I woke up in the middle of the night knowing that I had mastitis.  There was no “what is this strange feeling?” or “maybe I do”, it was immediately obvious.  Maybe it's because I'm an educated mother of today, or maybe it's because I got The Mastitis of Doom.  Either way, ten minutes after waking up and knowing I had a boob infection, I started to get the shakes.  Severe, can't-hold-a-phone-to-my-ear, shakes.  No temperature yet.  But that changed fast.  I went from 98.1F to 104.7F in 45 minutes.

I called the hospital's off-hour nurse line, decided I really didn't want to go into the emergency room and scheduled an appointment with a practitioner first thing in the morning so I could get some antibiotics. I already had an appointment in the morning with the hospital's breastfeeding education nurses, to make sure we were doing everything right. The shaking had mostly stopped, and switched to merely shivering.

When we left home, my temp was 105.1F, and steadily dropped, so that when the breastfeeding nurses took it I was at 101, and when I finally got into the nurse practitioner, it was only 99.  At this, she mentioned that maybe I could just “tough it out” without antibiotics, and seemed to disbelieve that my temp had been so high only a few hours ago.  Until she saw my breast.
  
“Oh my god.”

Those were her words.  There was no more talk of toughing it out.  She prescribed particularly vigorous antibiotics and had the lab do a white blood cell count to make sure I didn't need to be hospitalized.  And after one more look at my breast,- mouth open and head shaking in disbelief as she did,- she decided I needed to have a blood test done every day until the infection cleared.

My husband had to work, so I drove down myself the next day.  Not the smartest thing I've ever did, knowing now that mastitis can make you pass out without warning.  My fever was hovering around 102, and I was determined to nurse through it.  My mother had been chatting with her friends, and had all sorts of “I had mastitis, it was horrible, but I persevered.” stories to relate to me.  On the way back I had to pull over and rest twice; bright spots started to flash in front of me.  I made it to my parents' to pick up the baby and didn't get any farther.  I was just going to take a short nap, just until I stopped being so dizzy.  I don't remember much after that.  

My mom said I kept telling her my head hurt, and that I wouldn't open my eyes.  I wouldn't quit mumbling, but she couldn't understand what I was saying.  When my dad came home he understood that I was asking to be taken to the hospital.  I couldn't walk, he carried me out to the car and they drove me down.  When we got there, the EMT's took one look at me and chastised my parents for not calling the ambulance; I was in shock.

I started to remember things after I was in the emergency room.  I told the doctor I had mastitis.  He asked if I had an epidural, and if my head hurt.  Oh god yes.  
“Worst headache of your life?”
Yes.  Easily.
There's no way that this is just mastitis, he told me.  You've probably got meningitis.

It wasn't meningitis.  It was just mastitis.  Just mastitis.  I was in the hospital for four days.  I didn't see my newborn daughter for four days.  I couldn't sit up in bed without vomiting.  I couldn't get up to go to the bathroom without passing out.  But I pumped.  It was miserable and incredibly painful, but goddammit, I was going to feed my baby.  

After I got home, I couldn't do much more than lay in bed for two weeks.  And pump.  Every two hours, 24 hours a day.  I tried to breastfeed her after the hospital, or rather my husband would hold her and I would lie there sobbing.  But, at eight days old, she had been fed with a bottle for the latter half of her waking life.  After two sucks she would just scream.  Every day, twice a day, for four weeks we tried to get her to nurse.  We went to lactation consultants and maternity nurses who would do exactly what I had been doing, and would fail to get her to nurse, just as I had.

And they would tsk tsk me and say “Babies drain the breast better than the pump.”  Like that would somehow convince my daughter to suck.  Like it was my fault.  After a month of failure, I gave up.

But I pumped.  And damn, was I good at it.  3 to 5 ounces out of each breast, every two hours, every day.  That's over half a gallon a day.  When my lactation consultant heard my schedule, she told me to dial it back a bit.  The doctors and nurses at the hospital were very adamant about me pumping every two hours at a minimum; they never told me to cut back after the infection cleared.

Dial it back I did, but I was still freezing more milk than she was drinking.  I was looking into donating to a milk bank when I got mastitis again.

Like the first time, I just knew.  Halfway through changing a diaper I realized that I needed to call the hospital.  I wasn't done being on hold when I got the shakes; way way worse than the first time.  I had to put the phone on speaker and set it on the floor.  My teeth were chattering so violently that the nurse couldn't understand me.  The shakes turned into full on convulsions, and I fell off the couch onto the floor, vomited, and pissed myself.  Cue memory loss.

This time I wound up in the ICU.  Otherwise it was all pretty much the same.  Exactly the same, actually.  The mastitis was in the exact same place.  The consensus among doctors is that I have a bum duct.  And for some reason the infection immediately goes to my blood.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with sepsis; you die.  By the grace of incredibly powerful antibiotics, I am alive to tell you this.

Quick recap: bum milk duct = mastitis = sepsis = death.

Now comes the moral of the story.  What did I learn?

The most interesting, and kind of unexpected reaction from people, was one of dismissal.  Not of breastfeeding, more the challenges that come with it.  This, surprisingly, was perpetuated most strongly by the medical staff.  An ICU nurse asked me what I was in for as she was taking my vitals.  When I said mastitis, she perked up.  “Oh!  I had that.  It's absolutely awful.  Of course, back when I had it they wouldn't let you in the hospital for it, you just had to nurse through it.”  *In the ICU.*  She had just told me that my blood pressure was 80/44, and with the same breath, implied that my reason for being there wasn't legitimate.  I experienced that same reaction (though none nearly as overt) from one of every two nurses.  Gosh it sure is horrible that you have mastitis, but lucky you it's nothing serious.  I sensed that some of that came from a place of encouragement; don't worry I've been there, it's not so bad, don't give up breastfeeding, etc.  But the execution was really horrible.  It mostly came across as trivializing a very serious situation.  

It wasn't until my doctor explained exactly how deathly ill I had been that I began to realize I had felt like a faker.  Like I wasn't really sick enough to be in the hospital, like they were just humoring me until someone who was actually sick came along.  Looking back at most of the reactions I got from people, especially after the first time I ended up in the hospital, I can understand why.  Maybe this is a common phenomenon with most illnesses; I wouldn't know, I've never been hospitalized before, but I can't help feeling like it's got a lot to do with how our society deals with breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding in our culture is at a weird and kind of awful place.  It's ruthlessly promoted as being the only option for a decent mother.  And I don't mean ruthlessly promoted by the medical sector.  Ninety percent of the medical employees who worked with me were understanding and respectful of my choices.  

The ruthless promoters are the bystanders.  People in the grocery store will see me with my baby and ask if I'm breastfeeding.  When I answer in the negative, they launch into a mini-sermon.  Some of these people were strangers.  I've officially been asked if I've found breastfeeding more often than if I've found Jesus.  

On the flip side, it's still a quasi-shameful thing to do.  You cannot find a place to pump in the U.S.  I found one nursing room, and there was no outlet.  Most public bathrooms don't have outlets.  The hospital had no place to pump.  *The hospital, which employs several people whose sole job is to help women breastfeed, had no place to pump.*  Mixed messages, is what I'm getting.  And I never had the opportunity to get dirty looks by breastfeeding in public.

Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, I was able to back away from the pressure applied to mothers to breastfeed and realize that they really are powerful.  After this whole ordeal I made a comment about not looking forward to doing this again with our next kid, and my husband looked at me like I was crazy.
“What are you talking about?  You're not going to breastfeed again.”
“Why wouldn't I?”
“You almost died.  Twice.” 
“But... Babies: smarter.  Healthier.”
“...You almost died.  Twice.”

I almost died.  Twice.  And yet I didn't even entertain the thought of not breastfeeding until he brought it up.  That's not getting back on the horse, that's stupid.  You can't be a responsible parent if you're dead.  My first thought after that wasn't “Maybe I shouldn't breastfeed again,” it was “I guess I'm not having another kid.”

The family went one way to do some rides, I went another to a terrace with lots of shade and picnic tables. The tables were round and had four benches around them. I walked into the area and right in the middle of all the action was three other moms nursing their little ones. I felt brave (probably from all these parenting subreddits) and walked over to them. I ended up joining the nursing circle and we talked babies for about thirty minutes. It was so amazing! The best part for me, though, would have to have been that NONE of us used a cover (since it was hot in that particular area). 

I've never experienced anything quiet so...moving. My family didn't understand why I was so excited! no one in the area eating with their families and kids batted an eye at us! One older gentleman actually shooed a male peacock away from getting under our table.

As she was driving away she yelled out her window, ""You go girl! I breastfed all my kids. He'll hardly be sick."" I told her thank you and she went on to tell me she doesn't see that very often and to not let anyone tell me anything about breastfeeding in public.

He was sedated and intubated for most of that time, meaning he couldn't nurse.  I pumped exclusively for that month, and then for three more at home when he still couldn't eat orally and had to be fed through a g-tube.  After what felt like a failure in not being able to get him to nurse, pumping gave me a sense of control and we were still able to feed him the milk through a tube.

Now, six months later, he's been nursing for two months and it finally occurred to me that the massive amount of milk in my freezer would never be used.  I donated it through Human Milk 4 Human Babies, and it's the best feeling in the world. Our extra milk is going to a family with an adopted baby girl, whose mama knows how wonderful breastmilk is for her little one.  I plan to continue to pump and donate my extra milk, and I would encourage mamas who can to donate - there's a huge need out there for milk and it's hard to get in some areas.  Does anyone else have a story about donating?  What was your experience like?

You peacefully wake up while your two little ones have their morning milk and slowly wake up.

YOU KEEP YOUR EFFING MOUTH CLOSED.


I know we all have to deal with stupid comments from a lot of people, but lately I've been hearing so much negativity from close friends of mine. I can handle the moronic comments from strangers, acquaintances, even family members who think they're being helpful. But I have smart, sensitive, and kind friends who are saying the assiest things to me lately! Like, ""Well, as long as you're not still breastfeeding her when she's 2!"" or ""It's really time to stop breastfeeding when the kid can talk."" WTF?


Unfortunately, I always come up with the best responses long after the conversation ends. (I'm just *waiting* to use the response, ""Oh, is that what the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends? No? Is that what the World Health Organization recommends? No? Well, that's interesting, then. Where are you getting these recommendations?""...)

You all really encouraged me to keep on and improve my calorie intake and it has probably saved my sons life. 
Last Friday he came down with a monster cold and cough. He stopped eating all solids on Friday. On Monday morning he started vomiting every 15 minutes and had bad diarrhea and was diagnosed with norovirus. He has been on Zofran since Tuesday which has helped the vomiting, but he won't take anything by mouth, not pedialyte popsicles, nothing. He is SO SICK. It is heartbreaking. He's already lost 5 lbs.

Of course I have been on constant contact with his pediatrician and she told me last night he would have been hospitalized for sure if he wasn't still breastfeeding.  

I had forgotten that this was one of the reasons to keep breastfeeding. I read an article or blog once when I was pregnant about a mom who was able to breastfeed her daughter through her daughters chemo treatments when she was three and I filed it away under really important reasons to do extended breastfeeding and then somehow forgot when everyone was pressuring me to quit over the last 18 months. 

I have made it a point when talking to everyone now to say that the doctor said it is very good he's getting breastmilk. FEELS GOOD!

I was walking through an isle after she fell asleep in her sling, and this pregnant mama that had 2 other girls with her stopped me and said ""thank you for nursing in public.

A few days ago, my husband and I had tickets to see Zelda in symphony. The show started at 7:30... and come 5:00, the babysitter cancels. We said, fuck it, this is Zelda, babysitter or not, we are going. 

So we get to the symphony late. We enter and the room is already dark, with the performance about to begin. Everyone starts clapping. My daughter freaks out and starts screaming like someone is trying to kill her.

So yeah.. we were *those* parents. The ones that brought a baby to a symphony.

So we rushed outside of the concert hall.. and as soon as we step into the well lit room, BAM, quiet smiling baby. So we wait outside with her for about 15 minutes, and step back into the room. She was prepared this time for the dark and the noise, so she didn't cry out instantly. But she was still making little unhappy noises and it would have eventually lead to a meltdown. I try to give her a bottle. She practically slaps it out of my hand and proceeds towards meltdown mode. So I whip out a boob. She takes it. Noise: irrelevant. Darkness: irrelevant. Not being able to crawl around: irrelevant. 

The rest of the night was pleasant. I breastfed through most of the rest of the performance. During the last song, my daughter stopped breastfeeding to dance on my lap to the beat of the music.

I just wanted to share this awesome breastfeeding experience and to thank everyone here for their continued support. I would never have had the courage to breastfeed in public if it wasn't for you guys here... actually I probably wouldn't even be breastfeeding anymore.

To my point: the ER Dr. was super sweet and caring, worked quickly to get her pain under control, and when we were talking I had mentioned that ""she would only calm down when nursing, but I'm tapped now"" (I went back to work full time and my supply tanked. I'm actually quitting so I can be with my daughter all the time and hopefully continue nursing) she said ""come on mama, you can do it! She's only 6 months old! Don't give up!"" 

You almost had to pick my jaw up off the floor. Thank you, ER doctor.

Nobody has been discouraging, but having that boost made me feel amazing. 

I swear, if that visit hadn't cost me $150.00 (on top of the already ~100 we spent at other doctors this week, plus our ~$400 monthly cost for insurance) I would take her back to see that doctor all the time.

In the hospital he had tons of trouble with breast feeding and was losing a lot of weight. We tried everything. Shield, SNS, breast shells to see if we could get my nipples poking out more... and a home care visit when we got home. Once home we were doing breast, supplement w/ bottle, then pump. It would take him at least 30 minutes to latch because he'd get so angry and then within 5 minutes he'd be off the breast fussing or sound asleep. 

After a day or two of this I LOST IT. We breed gerbils for snake food (sorry gerbil lovers) and I was watching a gerbil feed her litter and got jealous. I BAWLED my eyes out. At that point I kind of gave up on breast feeding and went to just pumping and supplementing with formula when I didn't produce milk. I know I should have called a LC, but I was so tired and disappointed I did what worked best at the time. 

I did however keep occasionally trying, but not pushing it as I heard stories from people that after a month or so their child just suddenly figured the whole boob thing out. So maybe once a day I'd try to get him to latch. The last week he started suckling a little. A few days ago he latched and ate a little for a couple of minutes. Tonight he latched and ate for a good 10 minutes until he was full and fell asleep!

We had tried everything, skin to skin, football hold,cross hold, swaddling (which neither of us liked doing) cup feeding and id called help lines but we were doing everything that could be done.

So the angel that is my MW suggested bath feeding, we just tried it, it was wonderful, so relaxing and peaceful, plus my SO got involved by pouring water over us to keep warm.

When it was done with, I was shaking. It wasn't a great experience. And it wasn't my first experience- this is my third baby, and I nursed my previous two for over 2 years, each. I've had nasty snide comments before, but never *yelling*. This woman was so angry. So, so angry. I couldn't get mad at her. I just pitied her. What had to happen to make her so upset at even the sight of another woman nursing her baby? 

I was upset, but I realized I'd rather be the one yelled at than someone who may be learning how to nurse, or who might be doing it for the first time. But the ease with which she did that made me wonder how many women  to whom she'd done that before me. 

She told me I was ""fucking disgusting,"" that there were children that might see that (apparently she's worried about what they see but not what they hear?) and that I had no self-respect because I didn't ""cover it up."" 

""Covering up"" doesn't work for every mom &amp; baby. And honestly, I had forgotten he was nursing (he was in the sling).

[Update],bouncyyetfirm,70,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/10ksvd/skinny_baby_woes_update/,"About a month ago, I posted [concerns about my son's weight gain](http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/z58mc/skinny_baby_woes/) and you guys gave me all sorts of advice. I brought up the issue at the four month check-up last week and the new doctor agreed with me that weight gain has certainly become a problem. The baby only gained 12 oz last month and has now fallen to the 5th percentile for his age. The doctor was wonderful, though; never once mentioned formula or accusing me of having an inadequate supply. She asked knowledgeable questions and encouraged me to make an appointment with out lactation consulatant post haste. 

Verdict: Tongue-tie. A really, really good case of tongue-tie. I had my suspicions about this since he was born, since his tongue is so cleft and he's never been able to stick it out of his mouth. I brought it up to his original pediatrician more than once and he brushed it off each time (one of many reasons we stopped going to him). The LC was super apologetic because, when we saw her a week post-partum, she diagnosed M as tongue-tied but was sure he'd ""grow out of it"". She was wrong and totally apologized for it. The issue now is that because he has such a poor suck, is such a curious, hyper, impatient baby, he nurses long enough to curb his hunger and then pops off to go play. We found out he only gets about 1.5 oz in a feeding. If this keeps up, my supply will dwindle and he'll self-wean before he's a year old. So, now, my supply is pretty low and I'm on a crazy regimen to increase it while we fix the tongue-tie; 3 Fenugreek capsules 3 times a day, 5 cups Mother's Milk tea daily, offering the breast every two hours when baby is awake and pumping three times a day for twenty minutes while M sleeps. Whew! 

In the meantime, the tongue-tie can't be corrected with a simple office visit; the baby is too old for that and needs to go under anesthesia for the procedure. The hospital closest to us has one of the lowest ratings in my state for childrens' care, so we're making the drive next Wednesday to get M evaluated at the Childrens' National Medical Center in Washington DC. It's been a crazy three days trying to find a Dr. who takes our insurance and will see M within the next two weeks. I've been on the phone non-stop since Tuesday. But, now we're making some progress and I'm happy to finally know why my boy is so skinny and to know this will be easy to fix! I'm so glad it's not a medical issue, just a very common nursing problem. 

So, yeah, the moral of the story is: Go with your instincts, advocate for your baby and your brestfeeding relationship, and get in touch with a good LC! ",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_10ksvd,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/10ksvd/skinny_baby_woes_update/,

My mother, the SO, my son and I went to a restaurant to relax for a little while. My son got fussy, and wanted to feed. 

I'd never fed in public before, and was a little apprehensive, thankfully my mom and SO were super supportive of me feeding him at the table rather than relocating to the bathroom.

Other than the staff, there was only one other person in the restaurant, an older woman. I was in the middle of feeding my son (slightly blanket covered because my mom was convinced the waiter was trying to scope my boobs), and the woman walks up to our table. 

""Are you breastfeeding?""

I was a bit nervous that I was about to get a piece of her mind. But of course I say that I am.

She smiled wide and said ""Good for you! I'm proud of you.""

It is all but resolved and with what I gave her has helped and given them a small stash to fall back on.

In the meantime I still had about 500oz in my freezer and am pumping on average about 24 oz for the freezer every day.  It just seemed wasteful to dump any of it due to lack of freezer space.  I ran across a mention of a Facebook group in this subreddit and looked into it.  This morning I met up with a momma of a preemie who was unable to breastfeed whose wee one has a metabolic disorder and gave her the lot of it.  I received a text 3 hours after she picked it up telling me how much her little guy loved it and now we have a plan set up for me to continue to pump for her as well.  It just feels good to be able to help people with something so simple just because I can, especially knowing that there are mommas out there who struggle so much and want to breastfeed but have problems when I am on the other side of it breastfeeding but having oversupply.

Just had a warm fuzzy feeling when I received her message and had to share :)

Addition:  Thank you everyone for your kind words.  This subreddit has been a wonderful place of support for a while while I was still lurking and going through the paces myself of the first few weeks and more than once I wanted to give up on BF altogether, but we soldiered through the pain and felt confident enough to help others who weren't in the same place me and my LO were.

The TL;DR of the message below is that I went to use their private advertised ""Nursing Room"" only to find that it is a large bathroom with a rocking chair that a custodian was using to take a shit.

I'm asking them to remedy their situation, preferably by creating a real nursing room but at minimum by removing the text on their website that advertises private nursing spaces. 

Blows my mind that a Science Center can think this is acceptable. 

Oh also using a throwaway since my real name is on the Facebook post.

*****
We are recent transplants to New Jersey, and one of the first things I did when we moved here was to buy a membership to the Liberty Science Center. We had been long time members of the Maryland Science center back home and I knew this would be a great place to spend rainy summer days with my kids. Everything looked promising and your site promised me that “Special nursing rooms are also available.”

Yesterday was the second time we used our membership. I brought my four year old, two year old and six month old for the 9:30 am story time and 10:10 explorer session in the iExplore area and they had a blast. Towards the end of our time there, I asked an associate to let me into one of these locked nursing rooms and was horrified at what happened next.

When the associate unlocked the door to the “nursing room,” we were greeted by a custodial worker (and I’ll use the correct scientific terms here since after all this is the Science Center) who was using this space to defecate. As if that wasn’t horrifying enough, I was disgusted to learn that this “nursing room” was no more than a large bathroom with a rocking chair in it. I politely told the associate who had let me in that I was not going to use a space that smelled like human feces to nurse my child and she was very apologetic about the situation. 
You advertise on your site that “on each of LSC’s four floors, guests will find private family restrooms equipped with changing tables. Special nursing rooms are also available.” This sentence would lead me to believe that these are two distinct rooms, which based on my experience they are clearly not.

What exactly was I supposed to do with my other two children while I nursed my infant? Let them do water play in the toilet? Let them do science experiments about bacteria as they touched every germy surface in the bathroom?

I am asking that you do one of two things: Either remedy this situation and provide a proper nursing room (that is not in a bathroom) for your patrons, or immediately remove the text from your website that you offer “special nursing rooms.”

Additionally, you should have a talk with your custodial staff and strongly discourage them from using these private family facilities for their own defecation.

His family thinks breastfeeding is gross and even sexual if you do it past 6 months. They think formula is just as good even when we point out on the can it says it's not. They formula fed. They sneer at women who BF in public with a cover on. The talk about how long it takes him to eat and how quickly he gets hungry so my milk must be bad because he should go three hours between feeds and eat 20 minutes max. They talk about how I am selfish because my husband doesn't give him a bottle every day (I CANNOT pump enough for a full feed unless I am hooked up all day). They don't believe that I don't respond well to the pump. They don't listen to reason. I'm always on edge. He was in the NICU the first week of life and when we brought him home I broke down once and gave him formula. I had a bad lactation consultant who said I would have to formula supplement because of my breast size and shape and that I should pump 200ml after a feeding or I don't have enough milk.   I looked at his logs today (wanted to see how long ago I changed his diaper since he leaked- apparently I have a heavy wetter since it was 20 min ago). I am so proud of myself. I still think about quitting every day honestly and I am so happy I am pushing myself to do it even with no support or worse claiming I'm doing it for sexual purposes.

My daughter's birthday is Friday, and I am taking the day off of work so she only needs milk for tomorrow.  We plan to keep BFing until we are ready to stop, and I will just wean off the pump at work.  

Pumping has been incredibly challenging for me.  I have never gotten more than 5 oz a session, and average 3 oz.  At 5 months old she was eating 15 oz a day.  I would pump 3 times at work and then every hour I'd have to pump at home, eeking out an ounce per session until around midnight I'd finally get those last few drops to get us through the next day.  My lactation consultant gave me ideas and encouragement, but while I had plenty of milk I just don't respond well to pumps.  I ended up springing the money for a Symphony, downing Fenugreek until I smelled like a waffle, drank water like a camel, everything we could think of.  Though all of this I never had more than 20 oz in the freezer, and the last four months I have had nothing in the freezer at all.

Now, here we are a full year after her birth, and i can proudly say she has never had formula!  I am so glad I did it - breastfeeding is so much more than food.

(And Candy Crush takes up SO much of my phone time **shameshame**) I just spent an hour looking at everyone's pictures and reading all your stories of trouble and triumph... I wanted to say that no matter where you are on the awesome journey of breastfeeding, YOU ARE AWESOME. Your baby is SO lucky to have you as a mama. 

For those of you just starting, it gets better. Let me repeat IT GETS BETTER. My baby Alice is 8 months old now, and nursing is no problem. In the beginning EVERY FEEDING was a nightmare. I thought it would never be easy. I thought I would never make enough for her. I thought that working full time would be the death of our nursing relationship. And none of that came true. It may not always be your favorite thing, you may not always want to BF, sometimes you may want some space. But the journey you are starting with your baby is BEAUTIFUL, and no matter how long you choose to continue breastfeeding, you are making a choice to do something wonderful. 

Those of you with many months and years experience on me, THANK YOU. Every question you answer, every mama you reassure, every baby who is BF a little longer because you gave an encouraging word is another star on your AWESOMENESS chart in my mind. When my baby wasnt gaining and I was staring formula supplementing right in the face I was SO scared. And tired. And sad. But you ladies helped me, and you help every woman who comes here with a bad latch, or a wish for sleep, or a thought that they wont be enough for their baby. This community gives me hope for the mamas of the future, that we can make breastfeeding normal, and expected, and supported. One baby at a time. 

Thank you, r/breastfeeding, for all that you are, for being here for me when I needed you, and for being here now for all the mamas that need you now. I &lt;3 this community SO MUCH.

Can't really expect the level of intelligence to be that high but I thought people were more informed than they are. This question was posed to me by a girl who has a 8 year old daughter. When I told her that I had pumped before my daughter woke up, nursed her before taking her to daycare, and pumped again before work opened, she seemd shocked. 

Yesterday when I told my manager I needed to pump he told me I couldn't do it in the office (the only clean private place in the restaurant, other possible places would be the bathroom, which I am NOT going to do), I told him they had been all week and if he needed to call the gm he could. Then today he told me I needed to sanitize everything before leaving the office (I do anyway, I don't need to be told to keep my stuff clean), this was in front of about 5 other servers, when all I had said was ""I need to use the office"", so I thought that was pretty rude of him.  

I am just shocked at the immaturity and ignorance people have with breastfeeding. It's not like I'm walking around with my boobs hanging out, I am trying to keep my supply up while working, so that I don't have to stop breastfeeding any time soon. I make it super easy on my managers by pumping before the store opens and then again after our lunch rush which is about 4 hours later. I don't shove it in peoples faces and I give my managers a 30 minute notice on when I need to go pump. 

I'm just ranting, and I figured you ladies would understand, breastfeeding is a great thing, I know it is, my baby girl is content, and she does great at daycare, and she does great at home, she doesn't fuss, she sleeps almost all the way through the night except for a couple feedings.

I have serval friends who are breast feeding, I read some books... And the one thing I noticed is people sugar coat it. Are they afraid women will choose not to BF because its so dang hard? I was greatly unprepared and now I'm kinda ticked off and I REFUSE to sugar coat my experience.

* It hurts at first. SOOO BAD. I cried and screamed and wanted to throw formula down his throat cause latching hurt THAT bad. Now I hardly feel it.

* It never ends! He nurses vigorously for 5-7 minutes and then more or less pacifies for the next 30-60 minutes. The minute I take my nipple out he screams and we repeat. Now, if I wait until he releases my nipple back to me we are good and he'll continue to sleep.

* Not everyone has engorgement when their milk comes in. I freaked out thinking I was gonna have issues cause my boobs never felt different. He's still alive so I'm gonna assume my milk came in ;)

* Not everyone LIKES to breast feed. I thought it was going to be this whimsical, magical, rainbows and cupcakes kinda event - I hate it. I continue to do it because its best for him, and that's what I want more than I want my boobs back.

1355154831.0,54,self.breastfeeding,14lwat,"Breastfeeding on ""The Simpsons"": An Odd Surprise",HappyGiraffe,60,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/14lwat/breastfeeding_on_the_simpsons_an_odd_surprise/,"Last night, I watched an episode of The Simpsons with my husband. 

The premise was that ""really cool"" new neighbors move in next to the Simpsons, and Homer is desperate to be as ""cool"". The neighbors are from Portland, and are very stereotypically hipster cool: they compost, go on midnight bike rides and their son's birthday party is at an old slaughterhouse. On of the things that makes them ""cool"" is that the mother breastfeeds. 

Marge bottle feeds Maggie and feels incredibly pressured by this new woman. During a ""breastfeeding circle"", Marge tries to pretend to breastfeed Maggie but is revealed when a bottle falls on the ground. The other women in the group immediately attack her, even going so far as to say, 'If YOU won't breastfeed your baby, WE WILL.' Later in the episode, Marge's stockpile of formula saves the town by putting out a fire. 

I was so saddened by this view of breastfeeding: mothers pressuring/guilting other mothers, Marge feeling like a bad mother for not doing it, and then formula ""saving the day"".

BUT, at the very end of the episode, Marge says, ""You know, I do feel kind of guilty for not breastfeeding the kids. Except Lisa. I breastfed Lisa for 9 months."" Then the scene shows Bart watching TV, Lisa reading a book, and Maggie looking through the window at Lisa longingly with a sad look on her face. 

And that was it. There was no joke about it. Just this oddly quiet moment when the Simpsons seemed to say, ""Lisa was breastfed and it made a huge difference, and Maggie is worried that she got left out.""

It was a strange, sad moment (for Maggie, at least), but I was relieved to see that they didn't end the episode on this whole Breastfeeding Women are Obsessive Sanctimommies and Formula Feeding Moms are Relatable, Down To Earth Women. Really interesting episode. ",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_14lwat,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/14lwat/breastfeeding_on_the_simpsons_an_odd_surprise/,

It was much appreciated. 

However, yesterday was the day that decided it for me. I am moving my son to formula, and I am going to stop bfing. 

The reason I made this decision is very simple: I am diagnosed bipolar. I made the educated decision to stop my meds when I found out I was pregnant and for the most part it worked ok with careful mood monitoring. I had planned to continue on this path once DS was here since the medications that work to treat my disorder are most definitely not safe for breastfed babies. 

I underestimated how much your hormones change once baby is here, and it threw me for a loop. The past couple of days I've spent more time in bed than awake, and the time awake was mostly spent crying. I know, it's probably baby blues. But the problem with me is that something that small can trigger a big downward spiral. My husband and I talked about it at length, and we've decided we're not willing to take the chance of it going much further. It takes too long to titrate up and balance out, and my husband goes back to work full time on Monday. 

So moving forward my baby, my precious baby boy who I love more than life itself, will be formula fed. And yes, I do feel guilt at having to do this. But I want to be the best mommy I can be, the mommy he deserves, and that's not the mommy I've become, and if I continue down this path, I am headed for some serious issues that could potentially harm my baby. It's not worth it in my mind. 



I don't know why I wrote this, other than to get it off my chest, I suppose. And to definitely thank everyone for their support and understanding. You are all amazing, and I am so envious of the bonds you are able to have with your children through bfing. Keep it up ladies, you are all unbelievable. Thank you.

I did what the pediatrician said for one night, I didn't offer her the boob, only bottles [this kind](http://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-mOmma-Feeding-Bottle-Ounce/dp/B006YPTWHC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357345024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=momma+bottle). She took it like a pro and ate 2 separate bottles for 10oz total. At that point I decided she was ok and started offering her the breast again.

Had to take yesterday off because I got pink eye somehow (Bella doesn't have it so I am curious as to where I got it!), so she got the breast all day. She slept for most of the day and was up a lot last night (easy for me, we bedshare so I just pop a boob in and sleep). She had a big feeding at 5am and then another sortof big feeding at 7am. 

I had decided to take her into daycare early so that I could feed her and maybe see if she didn't want to eat there. So we arrived at daycare around 9:30 and they started warming up a bag of milk. I bounced her and played with her a little while it was heating up. We did warm it up a little warmer than they normally do (they said a lot of the babies like it a little warmer than normal). And I sat down with her the same way I had at home, I hold her like shes about to breastfeed, and then I introduce the bottle which she took just fine. She drank the whole thing in just a few minutes. The caregivers were shocked. So I burped her and set her on the boppy and told them to call me if they needed anything. 

I figured she would be fine for the duration of my work because she had eaten, and also when she was done eating I did top her off with some boob, she has no nipple confusion at all. So I went to work. Well they called me at 2 to say she took another bottle just fine (so at this point she had drank 8oz while I was gone). When I picked her up close to 6pm she had drank a total of 12oz which is awesome! I am so happy! They said she took the bottle the way I showed them to hold her, and then she took another bottle laying on her boppy. So I am pretty sure it was a trust issue and since I had fed her there she decided it was okay to eat there. Who knows what the deal was, point is she is taking a bottle just fine at daycare and I don't have to worry about it anymore! 

She is also starting to sit up by herself. And she scoots when she is on her back, she figured out how to lift her butt up and push herself with her legs to the sides or backward. We are working on rolling but I am happy with where she is at. 

I am so thankful for a community where I can come and ask a question and not get put down or made to feel like I am doing something wrong. I really appreciate you ladies suggesting different things. 

When I picked her up she was smiling and cooing, totally different child. I am so glad she is doing better!

1) About a week ago I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/146ml9/anyone_have_great_success_with_domperidone/) about a supply problem and whether domperidone is effective as a last resort. Absolute success! Baby is down to one top up bottle at bed time and I haven't had to express. She is full after every feed and I experience one let down every single feed. It makes me feel like crap, dry mouth and headache and stuff, but it was worth it. Five more weeks to go!

2) *I BREASTFED IN PUBLIC FOR THE FIRST TIME!* Woohoo!

I just haven't had the courage yet. I'm only nineteen and people can be very judgemental and I'm rather shy. But yesterday afternoon I was going for a walk along the esplanade with my fiancé and baby, and she got hungry. I hadn't packed a bottle so I sat down on a lovely bench seat facing the ocean in a high-traffic area (people, not cars) and relaxed and fed baby while enjoying the late afternoon sea breeze and watching seagulls and plovers squabble. It was so wonderful and I didn't feel self conscious, I felt *so damn good* about myself, I was so relaxed. And baby loved the atmosphere. If anybody gave me dirty looks I neither noticed nor did I care.

This mama will definitely be seen breastfeeding in public without a cover again!

**The story**

My Dad came to see me and the baby yesterday, I mentioned to him that we'd both had a cold and my milk supply appeared to have plummited. My parents had five children and my Mum EBF'd us all.

He said that she found it different with each one of us, she could barely keep up with one of my brothers but with me she had a plentiful supply. 
In fact, so much so that she had my Dad go down to the local hospital each day with a small bottle of milk to donate (I never knew this before!).

So my Dad would take this milk down each day and he said that it was starting to become a bit of a bind (a pain). One day he got there and said to the nurse on duty ""come on, be honest- is this (indicating small bottle of milk) doing anyone any good?"", the nurse looked at him and said ""come with me"". 

My Dad followed her onto a ward for premature babies, he said what struck him as he looked around at these tiny babies was how immature some of them looked, he thought possibly born at only 6/7 months gestation. 

The nurse then took a small syringe and took what seemed to him a tiny amount of milk, she held it up for him to see and said ""this is a full meal for one of these babies. My Dad looked around him again, ""enough said"".

My Dad obviously kept taking the milk. I never knew before now that my Mum donated, it's lovely to think that next year someone will be celebrating their 30th birthday not knowing that she helped to give them the best possible start to life. They may, like me even have their own babies now!

**My small victory**

As mentioned above, my supply seemed to take a real knock after having a cold last week; my breasts felt much softer than usual and the baby just wasn't getting full - I was getting worried. Anyhow, we spent the best part of the last 2-3 days in bed constantly nursing/snoozing trying to get baby full and stimulate my supply. This morning my supply seems much improved, one very relieved Mum here!

I got a dinky manual pump and a couple bottles but I didn't think I would need them.

Then I had my baby at 37 weeks and he wasn't able to latch because of my flat nipples, and then he developed nipple confusion because he was jaundiced and we had to give him bottles before he could learn to breast feed.

The lactation consultants at the hospital were rude and unhelpful, so for the first week at home I had to pump and bottle feed, which was exhausting. After a couple weeks I had success with the nipple shield, so that's how I'd been feeding him.

Attempts to wean from the shield were unsuccessful and would end in tears all around. Using a shield for me meant I could only feed him sitting up, and he had long feeds so I was so incredibly sleep deprived. Also there's lots of leakage during feeds, so lots of his blankets and clothes developed a stink. And I never fed him outside of the house, so I had to prepare formula or pump every time we went out, and then the next day work on bouncing back my supply.

**I set a goal for myself to make it to 3 months and then I would switch to formula.** Well, he's 3 1/2 months now and he's weaned from the shield! I noticed about a week ago that if I was holding him while he was hungry he would start sucking on my cheek, so I just started trying him on my bare boob, and he picked it up so well! Yesterday was my first full day feeding him without the shield.

It's amazing. I can feed him lying on my back or side, and now if he de-latches he can find his way back, I don't need to reposition the shield! His feeds are shorter, I don't end up with milk all over me, and he seems to sleep better at night though that could be coincidence.

I was never attached to breastfeeding and was at peace with my decision to formula feed, but now I'm so glad I stuck it out. No more washing bottles!!!

**I know this is long but I just want to celebrate...I never thought I'd enjoy breastfeeding! My life is so much easier now! I started off in tears a lot of the time, never sleeping, apologizing to my baby, resenting my sister for how easy she made it look, and feeling jealous of all the pics in this sub.

I've recently undergone a move from NYC to Kansas City and will soon be moving on to my final destination in Gold Canyon, AZ.  When I was in NYC I breastfed my baby (2 months old and under) everywhere I went. Examples: The met, brunch, lunch, dinner, the park, while walking, while shopping etc. and I only had 1 negative encounter in which an elderly lady came up to me in Anthropologie and said I was certainly of ""modern times"" lol while breastfeeding with a cover.

Anyway, since I've moved to Kansas I've had far more negative reactions from family, friends, and strangers. On my way here a Delta flight attendent asked me to cover up (I didn't, was already nursing her in an Ergo carrier) and when I told my husband about this he said to complain to the airline. I've been thinking about it, but haven't done it yet. 

However, since I've been here something dawned on me. Instead of complaining each time someone says something negative about breastfeeding in public, why not thank the individuals/businesses that do nothing and let me breastfeed in public with professionalism and courtesy? 

While it's a legal right to breastfeed in Kansas anywhere a mother is legally allowed to be, I've found my thank you phone calls to be really well received by the restaurant and store managers I've spoken to. I keep the calls simple, stating when I was in the establishment, that I breastfed, and that the staff was kind in leaving me to do this with no fuss.

This was just a thought I figured I'd share since Breastfeeding awareness week/month is soon upon us and this may be one little thing everyone could do.

Last week my daughter (15 months old) got very sick.  She had a very high fever that caused a febrile seizure, and we spent almost an entire day between her doctor's office and the emergency room.  It was terrifying and exhausting, but it could have been much worse.  I could nurse her.  After we determined she wasn't in immediate danger, she was still confused, scared, examined by strangers, and hadn't eaten in hours.  I nursed her.  Her heart rate needed to come down before we could transport her, so I nursed her.  The doctors were worried about dehydration from her fever, so I kept on nursing her.

I cannot imagine going through that day trying to find food and water (and coax her scared, groggy self into eating or drinking) on top of everything.  I couldn't leave her or explain to her what was going on.  I certainly didn't pack snacks when we raced out the door.  She came through everything just fine, without the dehydration the doctors feared, and I think breastmilk played a big role in making everything run smoother for all of us.

The school cites concerns that the electric pump is noisy, that pumping takes too long, that they cannot be sure that she is actually pumping when she says she is, that she would need supervision, that her peers may tease her, and that the nurse's refrigerator is for medicines only. 

It seems to me that if a teacher needed to pump milk, they would need to find a way to accommodate that - why can't they do the same for a student?

I sent them a respectful email encouraging them to rethink their position and to create a policy that fully supports any student or employee in their school who wishes to breastfeed.

And yet, there is the milk he needs when he needs it, and when he doesn't I don't feel uncomfortable. Now I will go to work for five or six hours, not even feel a slight need to pump, come home and there's plenty of milk. Some days, when I am gone for 12 hours and only managed to pump 2-3 oz. total, I think, ""Yeah, this might mean bad news."" And then the next day, he nurses just fine. No problems at all. We just keep adjusting without realizing it. 

This, to me, is the easiest part of nursing. I am not worried; he gets what he needs, and that's it. It's easy. And yet NOW is when people ask when I will wean.

We've had issues, sure, like not taking a bottle until 8 months, only nursing lying down until 9 months, or needing to nurse for/during every nap until 11 months, but these have always seemed like ""first world problems"" compared to what so many of you are going through.

My idea during pregnancy was to make two years. After struggling through the pain of engorged breasts, bleeding nipples, constant pumping and trying over and over to get the perfect latch going, my new goal became six months. I surpassed six months (with pain, because for some reason she always bit my left nipple) and after six months my new goal became a year. By the time my daughter was eleven months old I was only giving breast at bedtime, and naptime. By her birthday it had been reduced to just bedtime. By now, the thought of going two years seems absurd to me. I am so happy I breastfed, and made my goals, it's such a gift because I know there are women who never get that opportunity. I loved the bonding, I loved not having to sterilize bottles, I loved knowing what good I was doing for her immune system (which is superb!) But, let's be honest ladies, how good does it feel to wear a normal bra?

We had an exciting day of cake, presents, and friends. After everyone left, and it was just me and my little bug, he reminded me that while he is officially a year old, he still needs me. Today was so emotional for me. It sank in just how much he has grown, how he will never stop growing and becoming more and more independent. I cried so many times today. At the end of the day, all he wanted was to snuggle his ol' momma and have some milk. I needed that. He knew. I needed a reminder that he is still my baby, and that he still needs me. I love this baby boy so much, and seeing that even though he is growing up, he is still my baby for now. I guess I was worried that now that he is officially 1 he would all of a sudden be a big boy. I'm rambling. Breastfeeding him tonight was the best part of his whole birthday, for me. Happy birthday, Jude bug. You're my world, baby.

I was surprised by this pregnancy and definitely came out of the bathroom, positive test in hand, sobbing to my husband. I was getting over that and starting to feel excited when I lost it. So there is that mixture of relief and sadness happening. My 18 month old must have sensed my detachment yesterday and just wanted to be on top of me, nursing. Of course my abdomen was twisting and cramping and it hurt to have her on me, but I realized that the nursing was helping to move the miscarriage along by inducing more cramps. It felt a lot like nursing in those first hours after she was born and my uterus was contracting back down. What a strange, sad, de ja vu type of experience.

1363806430.0,39,self.breastfeeding,1aoi77,"UPDATE: I need help, about to give up on breastfeeding",themillionizer,40,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1aoi77/update_i_need_help_about_to_give_up_on/,"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/19qhhj/i_need_help_about_to_give_up_on_breastfeeding/) two weeks ago. I was in a terrible situation with a baby who had a serious fear of the breast, overactive letdown, a baby getting over a tongue tie and struggling to  use a nipple shield. 

Since that post we had his tongue tie re-evaluated and re-clipped on a Friday. The ped said we should see ""drastic improvement"" by Monday. By Sunday night I was starting to see his tongue more than I had ever seen it. It was like he was playing with it and figuring out what the heck it was for. The biggest improvement we noticed was that he latched sans nipple shield for about 30 seconds during the 3am feeding on Monday. 


That same Monday, I met with the holy grail lactation consultant in town. After meeting with her I was still using the nipple shield (to my chagrin) BUT she helped me find various positions where he would latch AND I could be comfortable, which was already a huge improvement. She also gave me strategies to encourage him to use his tongue and latch when he was ready. She assured me that the fact that he had latched without the nipple shield at all was a big deal and that her assessment showed his tongue was ""perfect"" he just needed time. Good enough for me. 

She also suggested that he see a craniosacral therapist who specializes in infants to ""loosen up"" his facial musculature and help him use his tongue better. After researching craniosacral therapy, it honestly seemed kinda crackpot but I was determined to try everything before giving up. So I made an appointment for the next day. 

He had his appointment with the craniosacral therapist, who surprised me with her knowledge of anatomical structures and how they affect the body (I'm an ICU nurse). It was basically an $80 baby massage focused on his head and spine. She showed me where his tightness was  and how it affected his tongue (it was veering to one side). She told me that I should see maximum effect in about two days. 

Almost exactly 2 days later, during the 3am feeding on Thursday, my baby was flailing and screaming, knocking off the nipple shield - basically no improvement from where I started, aside from the fact that I was in a more comfortable position. Fed up, I decided to try taking off the nipple shield again. 

I don't know what was different from when I tried without the nipple shield at the beginning of the feeding or what was different from the previous feeding. But my little nursling LATCHED. He just latched. No crying or screaming, he just latched, ate a full meal, and passed out. 

Since then (last Thursday, so almost a full week) every feeding has gone this way. I don't stress out about feeding him. He latches with a little encouragement and it all goes well from there. I am so grateful!

I cannot begin to describe the sense of relief and joy I feel about this. I want to thank you all for your encouragement. I had gotten so tired of people saying over and over ""It will get better"" and I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am so glad we've been successfully BF for so long, now I can see us going to a year or more. You ladies have given me so much hope, thank you!!

My new BF goal is to figure out how to NIP. If you have any tips on that, please let me know. I can't wait to be able to leave the house without a bottle. 

TL:DR I posted two weeks ago that I was about to give up on BF. You all encouraged me and shared your BF tales of woe. After my sons tongue tie was reclipped, we met with our 5th LC, and he had a craniosacral therapy session he finally latched calmly, and without a nipple shield and he's been going strong for almost a week. I can just whip a boob out and we're good to go. I am so happy!!

EDIT: I forgot to add that I no longer pump before each feeding. Which is a huge relief and timesaver!! The nursling seems to be able to handle the overactive letdown now that he latches better and milk isn't pooling in the nipple shield. This is another huge improvement!

I adore you. Truly, you've been such a light to our family. A joy. A miracle. And I find our nursing relationship-while a bit of a challenge-beautiful and fulfilling. That being said, I have just a few ideas to make things run a little smoother:

1. All that is required is your mouth and my breasts. You'll notice that when you're STARVING, I never hold my hands over my breasts. If you could take my lead perhaps, and stop putting both fists in your mouth when trying to eat, this may make you less inclined to scream and shriek...

2. I find it to be one of the most adorable things in the world that you feed with a death grip on my shirt/hair/breast. Even when it hurts from your steal tipped, sharpened, shank-like fingernails. Super cute. But, perhaps when those heavy eyelids close over your big beautiful eyes that look right into my soul and seem to threaten my very existence if I so much as clear my throat, scratch an itch, or god forbid surf the web, maybe you could release the death grip. I know you don't understand that we are separate people, or that I am even a person, but I am. I'm a person that hasn't showered, a person that hasn't gotten to cuddle your older brother. Please let go.

3. The car relaxes me too. I hate driving because I love to be a passenger. When *I* am riding shotgun I like to zone out, sneak peaks into people's homes, imagine all the lives that I am cruising by, it's refreshing. I've noticed that when *you* are bundled in to your carseat, you enjoy other things. Mainly pooping. I've also noticed that if we don't leave for a day, you don't poop for a day. And you certainly don't poop all the way up to your hair. Now when your brother was younger, and my disposable income was greater, those poop outfits got thrown away. We are not doing that anymore. And your grandmothers yell when you have stained clothes. Let's all do our part to keep the grandmothers from yelling shall we?

With so much love,

Um.. hello? Anyone ever think that many moms don't do this not because they don't KNOW about the benefits but because workplaces don't allow moms enough paid time off (ok, legally NONE, actually) and no time to pump or work from home if needed? I know I don't even have kids yet but this is a serious women's issue in this country and it makes me furious! For goodness sake how are moms supposed to manage 12 months when they only get 6 weeks off UNPAID??? Most families today depend on two incomes. (Also, I know that some women simply can't breastfeed, and I understand that. But it shouldn't be a situation they are forced into because they don't have enough time off or understanding enough employers).

The managers were all on the same page with my pumping, we were in a routine, they know when I need to pump. I got to lock my milk up in the cooler so people can't get to it or mess with it in any way. 

But that all changed today. 

I pumped like normal, at my normal time, I locked my milk up like normal, in the normal spot it is supposed to be locked up at.

Then I went to go get my milk after my shift was over, and it was gone. G.O.N.E. 

Cue panic. Why would someone move my milk? Where in the hell did they put it? 1000 things rushed through my mind. I went to ask the bartender if he moved it (bartenders are the only other people besides managers who have access to that part of the fridge with a lock and key). He said he did move it to a different shelf. I went back to the walk in, and looked all over for it. It was not there, gone completely. 

Then one of the cooks pointed to a shelf *outside* of the locked part, where my milk was laying, on a tray, on its side, in a pool of water. Cue fury. No cue pure unadulterated wrath. Why the fuck, what the fuck, where in the fuck did that become a good idea? 3 people saw it in the walk-in where it was, so I do have witnesses. I told the manger I was pissed off about it, and I wanted to write a statement. That is NOT okay. Not one bit. The manager blew me off, wouldn't let me write a statement. He went and asked the bartender about it, the bartender said ""it was in the way"" (it was a 5ounce bag of milk in a walk in cooler where we keep kegs of beer and all the wine, there was plenty of room in there for it). Then the manager asked if he had it standing up or on its side, the bartender said that he put it there standing up. THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE. The issue is that the fucking bag of milk is supposed to stay locked up so it cant end up in a fucking pool of god knows where the water had been, on its side. Now I don't even know if I can give my daughter that bag of milk because 1. I don't know if it was opened and 2. it was in a pool of fucking water, and I am super ocd about bacteria and everything and even though I work in an extremely clean restaurant it is the fucking principal of the matter - that is not where it was supposed to be. The managers pretty much blew me off when I asked to be able to complain about it. They defended the bartender. So when I got home I wrote 1 letter to my lawyer, and another letter to my boss. I am not letting this go. I have fought tooth and nail for my right to pump at work, I have fought for my right to keep my personal belongings safe and have done EVERYTHING the fucking managers have asked me to do. I am at the end of my fucking rope. I have been keeping my milk locked up there for over a month now (at the managers request, they wanted me to keep it locked up), and this is the first time any bartender has ever made a big deal about it. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. I shouldn't have to have this kind of stress on top of just living day to day as a breastfeeding mother who works full time and cant even afford to pay all her bills. I am so fucking furious. If my boss doesn't take this seriously I am going to escalate it to his boss and further until they realize that the shit I have been through since I went back to work is NOT OKAY. It has been one battle after another. Literally having to battle for something I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO BY LAW. 

But I'm going to keep on keeping on, because at least I know that the next mother who wants to pump at work wont have to go through this stuff (hopefully) because they will have seen what I have been through. I am fucking militant, I will make it to a year, and beyond. I don't fucking care if I have to pump out in the fucking dining room with everyone watching, I will not stop breastfeeding my child for some petty shitheads that I have to work with.

He's my first and only nursling (and only child).  He'd been down to nursing 2 or 3 times a week for maybe the past year.  Then he went 2 weeks without nursing last month, and I didn't even notice until after the fact.  Then he nursed 3 days in a row, each very brief, and never again.

So we made it 4.5 years (and maybe a week or two after, he actually just turned 4 1/2 mid-January).  He was able to end nursing on his own timeline, which is what I was hoping.  I would have liked more notice, but aside from that I don't really have complaints. :)  I suspected he was getting close to weaning in that the last time he was sick, he didn't ramp up nursing like he'd always done before.  

It's funny, my original nursing goal was to make it 6 months.  When I was pregnant, I never dreamed of nursing past 12 months and thought that was odd.  My perspective has really changed.

In early January, one of his older friends lost a baby tooth.  So I was talking to him about how baby teeth fall out and are replaced with big teeth that you'll have as a grown up.  I explained to him that baby teeth are also called ""milk teeth"" because they're the teeth you grow while you still nurse.  He told me, emphatically, ""Well, I'm still going to drink mama milk even after I have all my adult teeth!""

The last time I offered to nurse my boy, he smiled and said, ""Not anymore.  Your baby grew into a boy.""

I also until recently was able to easily express a drop of milk whenever I wanted to.  I tried a few days ago and it took a lot of effort to get a teeny tiny drop.  I was hoping I'd be one of those women who could express a drop whenever for years after weaning, but I guess not if it's already that difficult now.  

I was hit with weaning hormones for a couple days.  I wasn't expecting it to be so bad with how gradually he weaned, but it definitely hit me.  Mood swings, irritability, crying.  It passed in a few days and I hope those hormone fluctuations are gone for good.",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_185btj,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/185btj/well_my_son_45_has_weaned/,

Last few days, I had night shifts, and this morning, I was really engorged, so I decided put my pump in my purse and bring it. I don't usually bring my purse... I just keep my wallet in my jacket and call it a day.

A $200 pump! I feel like such an idiot. It doesn't help that I'm painfully engorged.

I tried manual expressing, which helped... also made a bit of a mess in the bathroom sink, which I tried to clean up... but I'm feeling depressed about it. I can't believe I lost my purse...

HB 741 will give working moms reasonable accommodations to pump breastmilk for their babies. It will also extend current pump-at-work laws to all public employees, including TEACHERS. 

HB 1706 will inform business owners of a mother's civil right to breastfeed anywhere she is otherwise authorized to be, and provide an enforcement so that right is not ignored. This is *vital* to improving bf rates, as 40% of mothers are afraid to nurse in public for fear of confrontation.

I've been on an antibiotic for a few days now for an infection. Fighting this infection has made me exhausted! Like putting a can of cat food in the washing machine exhausted.

So, last night I put my toddler down in the crib for bed like usual ( we're slowly getting him used to sleeping in his own bed). He went down quite and was right to sleep. After cleaning up down stairs I went to bed pretty zonked.

Apparently my husband came home late last night and stayed up playing computer games because he couldn't sleep. I was passed out cold so I don't remember any of this and thought he got into bed at some point.

Around 2:45 am my son woke up wanting to nurse. Since his crib is right next to the bed, I pulled him out like a zombie on autopilot into the big bed and latched him on. Then fell back to sleep for a moment. Suddenly, I wake confused. I look at the crib and see a dark mass in it that I think is my son. Then I look down and see what looks like my husband head bobbing up and down on my boob. I sit up quickly saying ""Honey what the fuck are do!?"" But when I look down I don't see my husband. I see my very confused, very sleepy son rooting for more boob. Look back over at the crib and what I thought was him was the cat! I started laughing hysterically at myself because clearly the infection has gone to my brain or something. Still laughing to myself I scoop up my toddler and snuggle back in the bed. 

I feel even sillier now than I did last night. O well, guess I'm losing it. This has also made me realize how much my son starting look like daddy.

TL;DR: woke thinking my husband was nursing on my boobs and my cat was a baby. May have brain eating infection.

So tomorrow my little girl will be 4 weeks old and she has been exclusively breastfeeding this whole time. Before she was born, I researched everything possible about breastfeeding. I've read through almost every article on [kellymom](http://www.kellymom.com) and was following /r/breastfeeding on a daily basis. 

To tell you the truth, I was pretty intimidated. It just seemed so hard.. and so many things could go wrong. I went into my breastfeeding relationship with my daughter with the mindset that if it would start causing me too much distress, that I would breastfeed and formula feed. I fell into a slight depression in the first half of my pregnancy with her, and I really didn't want to make myself more at risk for PPD. 

She was born by c-section (she was breeched) on Oct. 2, and we were doing skin to skin within an hour of her birth. She latched on immediately. She lost 10oz during our hospital stay, but my milk came in on the day of our discharge. She gained back those 10oz within 3 days! 

That first week was the hardest. But the lactation consultant in the hospital was so helpful. My nipples were so tender (just from not being used to being sucked on every 1-2 hours). And she gave me these [medela cooling pads](http://www.amazon.com/Medela-Tender-Care-Hydrogel-Pads/dp/B0011ECPA2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351538884&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=medela+cooling+pad) that helped so much. I highly suggest that all pregnant women preparing to breastfeed have these on hand for those first couple days. I was also putting on [lanolin](http://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-Breast-Cream-1-41-Ounce/dp/B001EPQ1US/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351538949&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lanolin+lanisoh) after every feeding. I broke down to tears maybe once or twice, but overall it wasn't so bad that I couldn't feed her. And I have a very low pain tolerance.

But after the first week, there was no pain at all. My milk came in with surplus! I just have a [medela hand pump](http://www.amazon.com/Medela-Harmony-Manual-Feeding-Mothers/dp/B004D7S8BY/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351539099&amp;sr=1-2-catcorr&amp;keywords=medela+hand+pump) and I could pump out 2-4 oz within 5 minutes after each feeding with her. I had a bit of engorgement at first, but it was nothing that frozen packs couldn't relieve. At 2 weeks postpartum, there wasn't any engorgement or pain whatsoever.

I feel so lucky that I haven't had to experience so many of the problems that many breastfeeding mothers have to go through. I honestly don't mind getting up with her through the night to feed. I love watching her suckle and fall asleep in my arms. I love seeing her milkdrunk face when she's finished. I love the bond I have with her. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I am so happy that I gave breastfeeding a good shot, and didn't give up when it hurt a bit.

I excpected it to be like my previous times, but it isn't meant to be.  

I successfully and joyfully bfed all three of my older children through at least their first birthdays, but not much longer. After they turned one their love of solid foods and cups lead them each to self ween themselves gradually and naturally till the last few bittersweet feedings.

But, this baby, this baby was a nursing champ.  She had very little interest in solid foods until almost ten months.  She didn't accept a bottle, and turned up her little button nose at anything that wasn't toasty-crunchy until she was good and ready. And that was fine with me.  It was a relief though, when she finally embraced solid foods (except applesauce for some reason.) Not to be intensively feeding a quickly growing baby 'round the clock was a nice break. Except that I hurt all the time.

A couple of months after she was born my feet started to hurt.  I just thought ""got to get back into shape and lose some of this baby weight I put on."" But it got worse.  It spread to my hips, back, elbow and hands.  Moving up though my body, always symmetrically and it even invaded my jaw joint.  It took months for me to not reason it away,  as just needing more rest, more exercise, more sleep.  It took being shocked by loss of my ability to show my son how old he was.  I couldn't hold up the middle three fingers of my right hand.  I was left looking at the claw shape I was making instead and thinking, ""Oh, shit."" 

So, doctor visits and blood tests leave me here.  Recently diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis.  I didn't even know what that was, but now i have it.  In order to save my joints from debilitating pain and permanent damage I need to start some serious drugs.  Drugs that have no business being introduced into the bodies of little snuggle bunnies who love nursing with mommy.  I thought I was going to nurse her for months yet. I thought I still had all this time with her. The best part of my day was having to sit down to spend precious minutes snuggling with the baby. I probably loved that time even more because moving, just going about my day, *hurts* so much.  And there's the rub. My best chances of avoiding permanent damage is starting aggressive treatment as soon as possible, including a lower dose regimen of a chemotherapy drug.  

So I'm weening her.  She is cooperating beautifully with taking bottles. I'm down to crying once a day.  It doesn't help that googling ""weening"" leads to lots of articles about ""baby led weening"" and the joys of extended breast feeding. Damn it Google. I wouldn't look it up if I didn't have to! Stop lecturing me! There are no good resources since the recommendations I eventually found for medically nessecitated weening boiled down to, ""stop feeding baby and don't give yourself mastitis."" Thanks.

I feel like I'm cutting off my own foot by doing this.  But, my baby is perfectly fine.  I'm the one who is a mess. But sentimentality is not my friend.  My baby will probably agree in the future that missing a few months of nursing is worth being able to use my hands when I'm fifty. But it still really sucks.  I just needed to lay it out for other people who will understand.

*Tldr:   Rheumatoid Arthritis can suck it.*

There were so many times I wanted to give up...

* When she gave me painful milk blisters the first few times we tried nursing
* When the milk blisters became full on bloody cracks
* When I got ridiculously sick and didn't know if I could still nurse her

But probably the most times I wanted to give up were almost every other day for the past 4 months because after she started drooling, her excess saliva basically made my eczema flare up on my nipples to the point where it became weeping eczema (basically I had persistent open, oozing wounds on my nipples and areola).  Peeling my nursing pads off my skin was always extremely painful.  

They're finally starting to heal over because pumping at work gives me a break from her mouth, but there were a lot of times when I didn't think I could go on.  Now I'm totally positive about going on another 6 months, at least.  Yay!!  I love nursing my baby and I am so happy that I stuck to it.

I'm super happy &amp; proud that we've made it to 4 months with only breast milk! 

I had to return to a demanding job with travel at 8 weeks, and through trial and much error Clara has only had my breastmilk. Despite pump issues, spills, crazy stress, and no formal support via my employer my supply has remained strong (thank you, Fenugreek!). Every once in a while someone will look at me like I'm insane when I regale them with stories of pumping on planes, in public bathrooms, backseats of taxis, and obsessively storing and cooling each precious ounce to take back to her, but I don't care! 
""Wow, I don't know how you do it, I would just quit and give her formula"". Yes, it's tons of planning and hours per day during my work week. Yes, it's ""inconvenient"". But it's so worth it to me. And I love that the bottles she gets when I'm away are just eating to her, but when we're together, she LOVES breastfeeding and taking her time to snuggle, coo, and just be happy she's with Mama. It's so wonderful after a crazy day of meetings. 

And ya know what? The courage to try this and make it work came from YOU, ladies. I can't remember who it was that gave me this bit of advice, but it really struck home: ""If you want to make it work, you'll be committed and it will work out"". It was SO empowering to me to focus on the positive and have faith in my body and my determination to keep Clara on my milk. 

My next goal is 6 months~ and after that, 1 year! I'll keep you updated!

THANKS AGAIN FOR A WONDERFUL, SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY OF MILK MAMAS!

",RandomGirl93,44,11,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/11sf8j/im_sick_and_tired_of_certain_people_trying_to/,"I am completely decided on breastfeeding my son, I've made it clear to anyone who's asked or commented on the subject. What drives me crazy is when mothers, who have tried and failed (or given up), try to tell me that I might not be able to do it or ""some babies don't even like breast milk"" or ""when he hits 12 months, you have to switch to cows milk"". I was given breast milk till I was around two years old and am not ashamed of it. 

Just because you ""couldn't"" breastfeed does not mean I wont be able to, just because you tried for a couple weeks and gave up does not mean I will. I'm sorry if I want what's best for my child- even if it means putting my energy and time and commitment into it. I know it'll be uncomfortable and maybe painful at first, I know it's not going to be easy, I know it'll take some more patience and practice than mixing water and powder. I don't need you making it sound like the worst thing in the world to make yourself feel better about giving up. 

I know there are women who honestly tried as hard as they could until they had no choice but to resort to formula, I don't mean to offend anyone. For the most part I just needed to vent and seek some advice. 

I'm due on November 13th and am fully ready to take on the challenge of breastfeeding because I know how beneficial it is. What I don't know is how successful I can be without the support of family and friends. I'm a young mother-to-be so both my family (who fully support and encourage my decision) and my husbands family will play a big role in our lives whether we like it or not. My mother in law, along with other young mothers I know, seem to want to discourage me from breastfeeding or keep telling me about how hard it's going to be (as if being a new mom isn't hard) and how most women can't even do it so I most likely wont be able to. I don't know to politely tell them to shut up and that I've made my decision. I want to be able to give them facts on why I'm so committed to breastfeeding and why I want to do it for longer than 12 months if I can. If not to inform them, then at least just shut them up. 

What I'm asking for is advice on how to handle the next situation that comes up where I feel like I am being bullied into giving up before I've even tried. Also, I've read some articles online about the benefits of breastfeeding but if you know of some that are factual that I can use as ""ammo"" in the next conversation that I have, I'd really appreciate it. 


**TL:DR I'm tired of women trying to justify how they gave up by telling me how hard and improbable it is that I will be able to successfully breastfeed my son. How can I tell them that I'm committed and what are some *facts* I can use that will help them accept if not support my decision?**

I always wear him in a Moby wrap - so I adjusted my clothes and let him eat! I'd say a pretty small portion of my breast was showing, as I make an effort to cover up, but shopping and wrangling a 3 month old can turn into a rodeo. Some perv followed me through the store, but I didn't notice. My husband became visibly upset - but instead of approaching and/or saying anything to pervy-perv he just told me that my breast was exposed, in a very irritated voice. I've been struggling to breastfeed in public at all, as I have very large breasts and it's very awkward for me, so it was a big blow to my confidence. I asked him later why he didn't just tell me what was going on, rather than making me feel ashamed. He said it never dawned on him!

I told him the problem was not that I was breastfeeding my child in the most discreet manner possible, but that pervy-perv felt that it was okay to follow me through the store staring at my chest, and if anyone should have been made to feel self-conscious, it should have been him. Our plan of action next time is for him to simply say loudly, so that the offending party can overhear, ""Someone is staring at your chest while you are feeding our child.""

Long story short, my husband was raised by a La Leche League member, she's now a breastfeeding consultant for WIC, he's the most awesome feminist dude I know, and yet.. when confronted with a situation like this, he still reverted back to what our culture tells us to do - shame the breastfeeder, and not the pervert taking advantage of the situation. That's how deep the breastfeeding shame goes. Sad. :(

1338606359.0,32,self.breastfeeding,ugnxx,UPDATE: Starting to breastfeed a 6 month old who has never breastfed,RedheadedMama,37,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/ugnxx/update_starting_to_breastfeed_a_6_month_old_who/,"SO! I talked to an LC yesterday (finally), and she is supposed to get the higher up IBCLC to call me next week. The one I talked to suggested THROWING AWAY his bottles, and the nipple shield, altogether, and giving him no choice but to feed right from the breast. She said to pump a little before so I would already be ""let down"" and he wouldn't have to work as hard at first.

Well, I didn't follow her advice EXACTLY, but I started using the nipple shield with the lact-aid today and refused to give in with a bottle after lunch time today. (There is NO WAY he would take my breast right away without the shield since my nipples are so flat. He doesn't remember how to latch onto a bottle nipple properly, he just sucks on the tip, so how could he figure out my nipples?!) The first feeding with the nipple shield was HORRIBLE!!! He SCREAMED and screamed and just was NOT happy about it, at all. Then I realized that the lact-aid was braking the suction under the nipple shield, so he couldn't get anything out! No wonder he was so mad at me... I took the lact-aid out of the picture (waste of $60, ugh), fought with him for another 15 minutes or so, and he FINALLY took it and calmed down. He finished one whole breast and I tried to switch him to the other but he only got 3 or 4 sucks in before the fussing started again, so I ended that feed.

Then, just about an hour ago, I went to feed him for bedtime, and I was prepared to fight with him like that again, but to my amazement, he saw the shield and did a face-plant right into my breast, latched on PERFECTLY and closed his eyes. He finished that breast and went to sleep! Not ONE SINGLE fuss out of him! I'm ECSTATIC!!!!!

I sooo hope he continues to do this well with the shield from now on. It's going to be hard this weekend and next week since we are going on vacation 8 hours away, but I am going to try my best to use the shield for every feed at stops along the way and once we get there. I hate to give him a bottle again at this point, knowing how much progress we have made in just 2 days, and how hard it was to get to this point.

Should I use a sippy cup or something else to give him my pumped milk on the way down there, assuming I have trouble using the shield in the car or once we get there? Will that make him less likely to refuse the shield again?",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_ugnxx,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/ugnxx/update_starting_to_breastfeed_a_6_month_old_who/,

I have been able to get her down for naps before, but never for bed. I am trying to not read too much into it but I can't help it, I'm just so excited. 

I am not ready to ""stop"" breastfeeding, but I will admit that it has worried me to have her be so reliant on it for sleeping. Mostly because it means I'm up a lot at night. So it would make me really happy if she could sleep without the boob! And I figured you guys are the only ones who would get why this is so exciting to me, so I had to share. 

Edit: A few of you have asked how I did it - I wish I had some magic answer for you, but sadly it's not been that simple for me. Here are a few factors: 

- I've been working for months to get her down for naps without nursing. I'm more willing to work longer and harder at this at naptime because I have more energy and flexibility than I do at bedtime. So that was the first step for me - just getting her down **at all** without nursing. 

- We developed a system where I would nurse, then hand her off to my husband, so that he was the one actually putting her down in the crib. This got her used to at least being physically put down by someone else. 

- From there, we just kept trying. We have a very loose bedtime routine that involved changing into jammies and looking at books, and when it hits ""bedtime,"" or sooner if we start seeing lots of sleep cues, we scoop her up, give her her sleep toy and pacifier, put out the light and talk or sing softly to her. We have just been trying this every single night to see if we can just get her to go to sleep that way without the boob. And it finally worked! Since then we've had mixed results but we are just going to keep at it. 

- A lot of it was really up to her. We seem to be very gradually starting down the road to weaning. She's dropped her naptime bottle at day care, stopped demanding to nurse in the morning, and is nursing less frequently at night. So I feel like this is part of a larger picture of her easing off of nursing in general. 

- As with most things I have found you just have to be brave and determined. Brave enough to try doing something that might make your baby cry; determined enough to try it over and over and over and over again even when you are thinking to yourself, ""This is ridiculous and it's never going to work."" I went through the same thing trying to transition her from bedsharing to sleeping by herself in the crib. Bravery and determination. And a supportive partner! I couldn't have done this without my husband at my side. Even when she won't let him hold her at all (which happens sometimes), he is there to pick up the stuff she drops, to grab a blanket for her if it's cold, to put out the light and turn on the humidifier, etc. It's a two-man job for sure. 

I hope something in here helps! Thanks as always for the support, you guys are awesome. ",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,1365084196.0,,,True,t3_1b9v76,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1b9v76/i_did_it/,

About two weeks ago, my boyfriend and his mother got into a huge fight and it came out that she's against our decision to breastfeed. This came as a shock to us because we thought she was supportive of it and my boyfriend wasn't even aware that he was formula fed until recently.

She told my boyfriend that she thinks we should be formula feeding her granddaughter because ""that's what's best"" and she was only saying it because she was concerned. My boyfriend told her that we've done our research and from what we've learned we made the decision to breastfeed. She goes on about how breastfeeding was the best thing *before* the invention of formula, but now that we have formula it is obviously more nutritionally sound. She says that all seven of her kids turned out perfectly healthy and they very rarely even get colds. My boyfriend is pretty angry at this point and blurts out, ""Yeah, I turned out fine, I have diabetes! Which, by the way, is something that breastfeeding prevents."" Mind you, he has type 1 diabetes, so it wasn't caused by any life choices he made. Whether or not it is related to the fact that he was formula fed, I don't know. He also threw in her face that she selfishly chose not to breastfeed because she wanted to smoke. The argument ended shortly after he said that and he ended up storming out.

They made up later that day and my boyfriend made it clear that the choices we've made on how we are going to raise our daughter are not going to change. She cried about how she only wanted what was best for her granddaughter and that she only meant well.

I thought this was all over once the argument was settled, but now she seems to be taking every opporunity to take a jab at our decision to breastfeed. She will bring up an article she read about how chemicals (such as cleaners, pollution from the air, etc.) that we breathe in can end up in breastmilk. My boyfriend will retort with an article he read about chemicals that are used to make rocket fuel were found in formula. She will just dismiss any evidence he brings up as just being ""not true"".

She goes on about our daughter's ""gas"" problem and how colicky she is. Yeah, our baby cries a lot because she wants to be constantly held and entertained. Amazing how she stops crying when you give her the attention she wants. But apparently it's due to breastfeeding and if we switched to formula ""I bet it would get better.""

I was at her place the other night while my boyfriend was at work and the baby was pretty fussy. I know it's because she's 17 weeks old and is going through a Wonder Week, but she starts going on about gas again. She asks me (for about the 5th or 6th time since the appointment) about what the doctor said about her fussiness. I told her that the doctor said that young babies are still working out the kinks in their digestive systems and it can cause them some discomfort/gas. I told her what the doctor said I can try eliminating from my diet to see if there's any improvement. I told her about cutting out dairy for a few weeks and saw no change. I said that when I cut out caffeine that I did see a difference. She replies with, ""See, that's not fair to you, you should be able to have a cup of coffee."" And then implies that I should switch to formula.

In the same visit, she asked how the baby was sleeping. I said that her sleep habits are still the same (usually a 4-6 hour stretch at first and then up every hour or two until 8am) and she says that she should be sleeping through the night by now. She says that breastmilk is preventing her from doing so because it's not as nutritionally beneficial as formula. Formula would fill her up better and she would sleep longer.

It seems now that every time we talk to her, she will either imply or just flat out say that we shouldn't be breastfeeding. My boyfriend has told her we aren't budging on this and that it's what we think is best for our baby. I feel even more uncomfortable when I'm alone with her because I'm not a confrontational person. It hurts my feelings when she says these things, but I don't know what to say to her. Any advice on how to handle these situations? She clearly isn't listening to my boyfriend and I have no idea what to say.",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_16vmze,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/16vmze/needing_some_advice_for_handling_my_mil/,

And I'm washing bottles. It shouldn't be like this"" I thought for probably the millionth time. It wasn't so much the bottles that bothered me, it was what they signified. Failure. I had failed. I had one job, and I couldn't even do that. 

After the horrible C- Section and even worse recovery, I had tried everything to breastfeed. I fought with the hospital to be able to breastfeed. I had CPS called on me because I chose to breastfeed my daughter, she wasn't a patient at the hospital, was under 18 and that meant she was a visitor and had to follow the visitor policy (no one after 8pm, they had told me). 

I don't know if anyone has ever told you, but breastfeeding in general is hard work. You're exhausted, you have sore nipples, your boobs explode with milk and invariably you either have a flow that is too slow, a flow that is too fast, a baby that is too fast or a baby that is too slow. It's never as magical as people would make it seem. You see a woman breastfeeding in a restaurant and all you see is beauty, what you don't see is when she was crying at 5am because the baby bit her, AGAIN.

You always hear that breast is best, and as a mother we all want to do our best. So I wasn't going to budge. But after the 5th surgery in less than 6 months, my daughter decided she was done. And I was devastated. She was only 5 months old. We tried an SNS, I pumped, I put her on the boob for everything. And it didn't work. 
I sighed as I placed the bottle on the counter. ""Why couldn't I do it? What's wrong with me?"". In all the despair and pain, there was one saving grace. I spent my free time looking for breast milk. You read that right, I spent most of my time getting in touch with organizations full of women that donated breast milk. Yes, there are milk banks. It takes a prescription and then costs about $600 a month. They actually make a profit off of women who are pumping and spending their time in order to help a baby. Why not just cut out the middle man and help each other? I email and post and beg and plead for milk. So many times I hear how I should give up and offer formula, that formula isn't poison. And it's not. But it also doesn't help soothe the wounds of breastfeeding failure. 

Once the milk is heated through, I head upstairs. She's getting bigger, and is just so smart. She's standing in her crib, screaming for food. I pick her up and she grabs the bottle greedily. I cuddle her, knowing it's not the same, but get comfort in the fact that she is getting what's best. Even if I didn't make it myself.

We started BLW at 5.5 months and I went through 5 rounds of blocked ducts/mastasis from January - April (I now know my body so I don't do that anymore!). I have a wonder freezer store that I am thrilled about since I have seen a significant drop in supply since January, I also stopped pumping daily June 4th (I am a teacher so that was the end of the school year).  I am not done nursing by any means but when school starts in August I will not be pumping anymore. I have HUGE respect for exclusive pumpers, I just know it is something I cannot continue with. I know my little boy will have breastmilk for quite some time to come. I never thought to give up nursing-no to say there were not hard times (mastasis and a few blisters HURT while nursing) but I knew I would never give up. I have changed my diet and I am actually smaller than when I got pregnant and feeling really good. I look back at the last year and I am amazed at the speed of time and changes. Tonight we even walked!  To all you mammas out there wondering if you can do it, you can. It is not about you, it is for that little tiny human being looking up at you (or as they get bigger putting their feet in your face or dancing and trying to take the boob with them). Every bit of latch frustration in the beginning, pain in the middle , and dancing baby has been worth it. I would do it again in a second :). This subreddit has been wonderful even though I rarely past-thank you!

You and your little one can do it!,OcelotCircus,31,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/17cung/struggling_to_breast_feed_dont_give_up_you_and/,"We had a rough start, and before two weeks she was fighting me at the breast. I was in tears whenever she woke to eat. It hurt, she wouldn't latch, I needed her to eat and I was pumping to fight off a case of mastitis. Stress was so high that I gave her a bottle of expressed milk because she wasn't letting me bring her close enough to nurse anymore. The bottle went down quicker and easier than anything. I cried. A lot. I felt completely rejected, like a horrible mother, etc.

I continued to offer the breast before every feeding, but she wanted nothing to do with it. If she played with the idea, it was only one side. She absolutely refused the other side, resulting in horribly plugged ducts (talking about clearing new plugged ducts after every pumping session, and enough plugged ducts to harden 3/4 my breast) and recurring cases of mastitis. I still had to pump every session in addition to trying to feed her. She ate every two hours, it took about 45 minutes per feeding to accomplish what I needed to. Leaving the house was a nightmare. I wasn't getting sleep. 

The night before her 4 week mark I tried to put her to the breast and, as usual, she wanted nothing to do with it. Defeated, I turned to my husband and told him I was exclusively pumping for the next year or two. He nodded in support. She got bottles throughout the night. 

The next morning, after he left for work, it was just her and I. I prepped a bottle and sat with an obviously hungry munchkin on the couch. I was about to give her the bottle when suddenly something came over me. It felt wrong. I decided to put her to the breast one more time. She fought me as usual. I gave her a couple sucks out of the bottle to curb her appetite and then put her directly on the breast. A latch!

She fed from that side beautifully. She was really hungry and using my breast for its intended purpose and not a pacifier for what seemed like the first time. She hasn't latched onto the other side in weeks. Not even an attempt was made on her part no matter what position I held her. I decided I would try anyway. It took some time, but once I got the nipple positioned toward the roof of her mouth she latched like never before and eagerly emptied that side too!

Right after this feeding she promptly fell asleep. This is the first time she felt satisfied from the breast. At this point i couldnt believe what had happened. Did she really just do what I thought she did?!  She fed all day, and later that night I fed her in bed with my husband next to me with instant latching on both sides. He watched and said ""She's really figured it out!"" and high fived me. A great weight was lifted from my shoulders.

 We have exclusively nursed for 3 weeks now. I couldn't be happier. :) After weeks of instant gratification from a bottle i thought for sure our nursing relationship was completely hopeless. Turns out its never too late as long as you've got the pumps going! I hope my story can be a little source of inspiration to someone out there. Don't give up!!!

The first 2 months I started to get the hang of it, and my boobs stopped hurting. At the 6 month mark, I could not be happier. I still am able to pump about 8oz when I wake up in the morning. 

I am not one of those moms who lost weight due to breastfeeding, in fact I only weigh 10 lbs less than I did when I gave birth to her. But I don't really care, she is healthy and happy and smart and that is all I could ask for. 

I am so impressed with the amount of mothers on here who are trying to breastfeed. If you go [here](http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm) you will see that while initial rates are high, at 6 months it drops a lot, and by a year it is less than 30% of moms still breastfeeding. I just want to encourage you all to keep doing it, and I know it isn't easy, we all come from different walks in life. And by no means should anyone continue breastfeeding if it is hampering their mental state. Happy mom, happy baby, that is the rule I go by. I question myself every day if I am still okay with what I am doing, if it is impacting me personally negatively. Obviously right now I am totally happy to continue doing it, but that may change tomorrow.

Baby just isn't adjusting well or is going through separation anxiety. He's 11 months now. Won't let me put him down(he's 32 lbs!) waking every 30 minutes... I'm using every ounce of creativity to deal with it all.

So anyway, I was **so painfully engorged** all day today and baby kept biting and head butting my breast in frustration. I thought it was a plugged duct so I kept pumping and taking warm showers and putting a warmed up diaper compress on it. It was some of the worst pain I've ever experienced and I got a 4th degree tear during my pitocin induced labor.  Not a stranger to pain... 

I had 101.3 fever and was vomiting so I went to the ER. It was PACKED. 

I waited 2 hours throwing up in the lobby. I frantically searched /r/breastfeeding for advice on my phone and came across a comment about milk blisters and a light bulb went off. I had noticed whenever my son would delatch there would be this tiny white glob on the tip of my nipple. I thought it must be the clog trying to work its way out and assumed it was why he was fussing so much. The commenter (I can't for the life of me find the comment now) said she took a needle and pierced the blister and milk came out like rain. At that moment my husband texted that he just couldn't soothe the baby, he has never taken a bottle or pacifier either, so those options were out. So I told the wonderful, sympathetic triage nurse that I had to go feed the baby, but I'd be back. 

I got home, took a sterilized needle to my beloved bosom and the milk flowed like a river!! I could have fed Mongolian triplets.

Baby is sound asleep next to me now, which is very very rare, he always wants to be in my arms. I'll call my doctor in the am and get some antibiotics for the infection, but most importantly I'm not in excruciating pain and I don't have to go back to the freak show that is the emergency room!

So in conclusion, **if you are having problems check for a tiny pin sized milk blister before you have to go to the ER a vomiting mess!**

I didn't even know there were different sizes of flange (horn), and I had been pumping along okay, but the local lactation center offers flange fittings, and I thought, hey, for $20, I'll make sure I'm doing it right. They laid out all the sizes and I pumped with each for a few minutes, from largest to smallest. When I found a size that seemed most comfortable, I pumped for ten minutes to make sure it still fit. 

I ended up being two sizes larger than the 24mm that comes with the Medela pump. I'm not large-chested, nor do I have large nipples, so I was surprised I had to go up instead of down. Apparently it has much more to do with the elasticity of your tissue than your starting size. But the biggest surprise was that I expressed much more milk with the right size. In ten minutes, and after having just nursed, I got more than I usually get an hour after nursing with 20 minutes of pumping, and I wasn't sore at all. 

I wish everyone had access to services like our lactation center. [This site from the r/breastfeeding FAQ](http://www.nursingangel.com.au/pages/Choosing-the-Correct-Breastshield-Size.html) is helpful, but trying them out in person (without having to buy different sizes) was really great. If you're pumping and having trouble getting enough milk, or if pumping is even just a bit uncomfortable, it's definitely worth trying a different size. I didn't know, so I thought I would share!

My son is 14 months old.  Exclusively breastfed.  It's been really wonderful.  I've never really had a problem.  He latched right away, gained a ton of weight.  No mastitis.  Everything's been perfect, until now that is.

I'll start out by saying that my son has NEVER, not once, slept through the night.  He bf's when he get's put down, he bf's at the very least 3 times a night, and then again when he wakes up.  

In a typical night, he would wake up, eat for 5-10 minutes, then roll over and go to sleep.  (I should mention that we co-sleep).  For the past month or so he has been wanting to stay on the boob, ALL NIGHT LONG.  It starts at about 2 am, when all his deep sleeping is done.  He'll want the boob, but then doesn't drop it.  If I try to take it out of his mouth he SCREAMS.  It doesn't matter how long I wait, he is never in a deep enough sleep for me to do anything.  I can't move, I can't roll over, my tit is constantly in his mouth.  My nipples are sore and raw.  I'm so sleep deprived and exhausted.  This morning, after over an hour of him on my boob, he FINALLY rolls over and falls asleep.  After a couple of minutes I feel confident enough to put my boob away.  WRONG!  How he knew my boob went back into my shirt, I'll never know, but he did and he was pissed.

I AM SOOOO F-ING READY TO QUIT!  I can't do this any more.  I can't take this.  My goal was to bf at the very least until he was two, and then let him self wean.  It is very important to me to have this bond, and provide all the additional health benefits.  But this is not what I expected at all.  He is actually on the boob more now at night than when he was born.

I want to continue breastfeeding, more than anything right now.  I just can't take much more of this.  My plan is to continue to bf when he initially goes down for naps and bed.  If he wakes up and wants boob, I'm going to deny him.  Get up, walk him around, go back to bed.  But no more boob in the middle of the night.  I know it is going to be a rough couple of days, but I have to get the message across to him that I am not a night time pacifier.  

Sorry in advance for any errors, gtg for the morning walk.  Thanks for letting me rant, and wish me luck!

I was very fortunate to have a baby that latched like a pro first time, and my mom around to keep my fears of ""not enough milk?"" at bay. 

It was really hard to pump at work / whilst traveling for work to ensure I could leave her 10-12 oz every day. But I kept at it, despite being mocked by colleagues and getting the advice from everyone including my midwife to switch to formula to make life easier for myself. In reality, I felt it was the one thing I could do ""right"" for her since I was gone all the time and had put us through a horrible birth. 

Then, at 5 months, I was fired from my hectic job. Pretty shitty, but the silver lining: my milk supply rebounded, I threw that damn pump in the drawer, and staying home with Clara has been more rewarding than any bonus I ever received. She's getting old enough to paw at my shirt collar when she's hungry, and we spend hours per day hanging out and nursing &amp; snuggling. She's a comfort nurser (never took a pacifier) and I'm glad I can be there for her. 

I want to thank all of you ladies for your ongoing support, kindness, and humor in this sub!!! You've given me so much inspiration.

Just want to give you a follow up to my previous [post on cross-nursing](http://redd.it/ydpua). It went well. I only needed to nurse the 3 month old boy once, since my friend (his mom) fed him right before she left, and then right after she came back 3 hours later. He was an easy going baby, so he fed from me with no problem. (""Oh, a nipple? I know what to do with that."") 

The one having an issue was actually my 4 month old girl. But she's always very clingy, that's just her personality. So she couldn't understand why she was on the bouncer and not on me. They started napping, then woke up around the same time, and they both have the habit of nursing once they're up. So if I could do anything differently with these two, I'd have them take their naps at different times. That way I  could nurse one without the other fussing from hunger/wanting to be with mommy.

But as I said, it went well all things considered. Everything that I was worried about ended up being a non-issue. My friend's baby took me, it felt natural even though he wasn't mine, and there was no problem with my milk supply. (I was gonna drink the milk tea someone here had recommended, but I didn't have the time to look for it.)

Anyway, I just want to say thank you for the encouragements and the stories. I very much enjoy reading about other women helping out each other with their milk, whether it was directly or pumped. Seriously, it does take a village. So kudos to you, ladies! You rock!

My son is four months old. For the past week he has been refusing to nurse during the day. He will only nurse for his one or two overnight feedings. So I have been pumping for him during the day. I hate it so much and I'm going insane. 

Everytime I try to get him to latch during the day he turns his head, cries, arches his back, pushes away.. I have no idea why! I don't know what I did amd it makes me so sad. I loved breastfeeding. Last night was the first time he nursed while sleepy before bed and I was so so happy. Tonight I thought I'd try again and he wouldn't nurse. Refused. Kept crying until I gave in and gave him a bottle (of breast milk.)

I am pumping enough for him but it sucks. I had a break down tonight when I couldn't let down for that stupid freaking pump. I just couldn't. Pumping takes thirty minutes and I pump every three hours. I have to drag it around everywhere and pump in bathrooms or the car and then feed my son a bottle. 

I wanted to breastfeed him for a year and it was going so well. He was gaining weight perfectly, has never had a bad latch, I've never had pain and I thought everything was awesome. Then out of nowhere he refuses the breast and I am just so sad. I don't understand why this is happening. I thought maybe it would last for a few days but a week?! 

No one understands my disappointment either. My MIL and mother can't get why I just won't put him on formula. But at this rate, I can't exclusively pump. It is taking a toll on my life and sanity. I just want to breastfeed my baby.

My manager came up to me right after I got to work this morning. He said he got my email and they handled the situation. The person who moved my milk was talked to and management did take my side on the matter. The milk should not have been moved outside of the locked part, there was no excuse for that. Apparently the person who moved it argued with the management saying that they didn't understand why the milk had to be there and that it was in the way. The manager made it clear to me that the person now understands why management decided to have me lock up the milk. I didn't ask any questions or push the issue any further. The person who moved my milk did not say one word to me today, usually they lightly harass me (this guy used to have a crush on me and follow me around work until I did not pay any attention to him, he still tries to touch me or bump into me on purpose but I avoid him as much as is possible), and I am glad he didn't say anything to me because I have a whole momma bear arsenal that I could unleash on him. I am not going to push the issue any further at work until another problem arises. If said problem arises and management fails to correct the situation I will be putting in a complaint.

Due to the frequency we started seeing mucus and blood, so we took him to the ER yesterday (we are on vacation and it was a holiday).  The ER doc said that it was probably just traveling stress and that he would be fine, but told me to stop bfing for the night and give him pedialyte instead.  I couldn't get ahold of his regular pedi who is super pro bfing but talked to my lactation consultant and decided I would continue bfing and only give him the pedialyte if his diapers got worse.  Lo and behold yesterday afternoon they slowed and today are mostly back to normal.  I did offer him the breast more than usual and was hyper aware of any dehydration signs.  He was eating well and still having a large number of wet diapers.  I talked to his pedi today and she was very happy I bfed instead of supplementing, so I feel great.

Here was my first post (under an old username) from about a year ago: http://redd.it/nizjt  

I was at a low and really run down and discouraged. This community and my IBCLC helped me hang in there. I'm happy to report that my son and I are coming up on 13 months and still going strong with no plans for weaning until he's ready.

For any new mom's out there struggling with breastfeeding issues, please know that it does get better. Keep fighting for info and support, there are many people out there willing to help even if your immediate circle of friends &amp; family are not supportive. Keep posting to this subreddit, contact Dr. Jack Newman by email (he does answer), seek out an IBCLC - if you're in a remote area some will Skype. Just keep going!

I went through the ringer with breastfeeding - low milk supply and was eventually ""diagnosed"" with hypoplastic breasts, my son rejected my breast for weeks at a time due to this low supply.

Two things I wish someone had told me before I started on this journey:

Breastfeeding is more than just breastmilk. If you absolutely cannot get up to a full supply, do NOT quit. Its not an all or nothing thing. Keep feeding from the breast as much as you can then follow up with a supplement using either an SNS or a bottle. Dont beat yourself up for not having a full supply. Some is better than none.

Use a slow flow nipple. I have tried nearly all the bottles on the market (I just couldnt get an SNS to work for me and I was fried at that point). I had good luck with the Como Tomo bottle with a newborn nipple. I have seen so many mothers discontinue their breastfeeding relationship early because they are using too fast of a flow nipple. Babies are smart, they want the easiest source of food and if the bottle is faster than your breast they're gonna go for the bottle.

First off I wanted to explain that I did not want to breastfeed at all mainly because to start with I am a very private person and the whole idea of it makes me uncomfortable (notice the present tense) Well my husband convinced me because the milk is good for my Lilly and I needed to get over myself anyway.

That being said she doesn't nurse very often. Maybe once a week if that and she only gets breastmilk,  no formula so I've been blessed there.

I have a double Avent hospital grade pump. I pump every 2-2.5 hours unless my boobs start itching then I pump on the spot. On average I get about 7.5-10 oz per pumping session. Lilly eats every 3-4 hours on average (on demand feeding) and each time she eats she does about 4oz (Unless she's fussy then om nom 6oz)

I supply about 42 EXTRA oz a day. By extra I mean I keep 6, 9oz bottles in the minifridge for Lilly at all times so anything outside of those bottles gets stored.

Due to all of the extra milk I am a long term donor to a woman who cannot breastfeed. I do not wish to correct this oversupply it really isn't a problem to me at all.

Overall the fact that I can solely pump makes me much more comfortable with breastfeeding because it does still bother me. :) Honestly judge me as you please but just know not only do I have a happy healthy breastmilk child of my own, but the lady I supply for no longer has to use formula on her preemie child.

1365917386.0,27,self.breastfeeding,1cb9mq,My first visit to a public breastfeeding room. (Crazy times),Previsible,31,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1cb9mq/my_first_visit_to_a_public_breastfeeding_room/,"So I managed to get all of my girlfriends from elementary school together for a baby and toddler day at a local childrens play place.


This place appealed to me because they have a BF room and I've never actually been to one. 


So before my LO started requesting to be fed we stayed mostly in the play places, then when she was ready to feed we made our way to the BF room. Well, firstly, the women there were not using it as it was meant to be used. We wandered in and the automatic lights came on and there was a lone baby sitting in a car seat. No mommy in sight. Well... she wants the boob so I'm not going to let a little audience stop me. We all sat down and I popped out the goods and we started feeding. It was about 10 minutes before the mother peeked into the room for her child. (And to mention, someone left a poop filled diaper in the room on the bench even though there are signs all over the room asking people to not leave diapers in the room and to not dispose of diapers in the trash there)


She looked at us, seemed hesitant and didn't want to come fully into the room because she saw my breast and turned around and walked away. My friends thought it was funny because she was sitting across, pretty far away from the room and just left her baby with a bunch of strangers. Shortly thereafter one of the people in her group came and grabbed the baby. 


My LO feeds for 20 mins per breast, sometimes longer so we decided to stay in the BF room seeing as no one at all was using it and it was just convenient as there were toys for the kids and a lot of privacy. While I was on boob number 2 they walked in with the same car seat but a different child was in it, one that obviously did not fit in it (feet hanging over the edge) he was crying and making a fuss which I don't mind because I would prefer my LO to be exposed to other children and noises frequently when she's not overstimulated. The woman then proceeded to leave that child in there alone as well. 


My friends being the troopers they are calmed the child down by making faces and playing peek-a-boo. We were in that room for about an hour and a half, almost 2 hours. Most of the time that we were there we were alone with someone elses child, and no other women came in to breast feed.


I was so surprised that with the amount of babies there, no mothers were breast feeding. I was shocked that the mothers would leave their children alone with strangers as well. Also, the disrespect of using the room as a garbage for poopy diapers. (I did pick up the poopy diaper and bag it for disposing BTW)


I wish more businesses would have BF rooms, but it's become obvious to me why it's not popular here yet.",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_1cb9mq,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1cb9mq/my_first_visit_to_a_public_breastfeeding_room/,

Y'all provided great support and I want to say thank you!

I finally found a new pediatrician. While we still have to use the old cantankerous doctor for wellness/vaccination visits (something to do with social insurance-these visits are free and keep healthy kids away from the sick ones, etc.) we were able to find a great pediatrician whom is a young, breastfeeding mother herself. 
She checked my daughter out today and affirmed what some of you had said about my daughter's weight being normal and as well as keeping up the feeding. She did not discourage, rather encouraged on demand feedings. We even talked about what the next 6 months would look like for nursing and weight gain. I feel more empowered and encouraged to keep up nursing for at least another 6 months, until baby is 18 months, and am actually looking forward to not having to think about weening anytime soon. 

So happy to have found support in pediatrics and in the /r/breastfeeding community. 

Thank you!

My LO is 10 months old, has been BF like a champ since day one. He came down with a fever and vomiting for a day and a half, and in the evening of the second day I decided to take him to a walk in clinic as our DR's office was closed. The Dr took his temperature (yup, as high as I'd said it was, as I was checking it too), took a split second look into his mouth to say he had a sore throat, and then questioned what he was eating.

 He eats lots of fruits / veggies / meats / etc, but the first thing out of my mouth was ""breast milk"" and before I could continue he crinkled his nose and said ""Breast milk? He's still on the breast?!? Well you will have to stop that right away"".  He then proceeded to ""inform"" me that breast milk will make a baby's stomach upset and be the cause of his vomiting, and that I should ""pump to relieve the pressure, but that the breastfeeding should be stopped right away, or at least as soon as possible"".  

So, this goes against everything I've ever read, plus I have always been in exceptional health and watch my diet strictly to ensure I give him the best milk I can make.  I got a second opinion from my own (younger, wiser) family Dr the next day.

Update:  I stuck with nearly 2 days of pumping every 2 hours and not breastfeeding.  It has been so very hard to deny my baby the breast :(  I called my insurance's help line and saw another lactation consultant today on a home visit and this one was wonderful.  She checked my baby for tongue tie and found nothing but found that my baby had a shallow latch.  She looked at the nipple shield the hospital gave me and found it to be much to small so she gave me a new shield of an appropriate size!  She said my technique was correct but the shallow latch was the problem.  I put on the new shield, latched my babe, and there was no pain! 

My baby hasn't been gaining weight at an appropriate rate.  She was 8 lbs at birth, down to 7 lbs. 5 oz. on day 3 and today on day 7 she was only 7 lbs. 5.5 oz.  This was very hard news to hear after all the pumping :(  My body couldn't meet my baby's needs and I feel awful, like I've been starving her.  Anyway, the new plan is breastfeeding on demand with the nipple shield as long as the pain is okay, pump after some feedings (only 3-4 times/day) and offer all extra breast milk.  If she takes all the extra breast milk, offer 1 oz of formula at a time and up to 4 oz a day if she wants it each time.  The nurse also gave me prescriptions for ointments to keep infection at bay.  We'll re-weigh the baby at her doctor's appointment next week.  

I'm so relieved to have a plan but I feel awful that my baby's been hungry and I haven't fed her adequately but I can try to get over that by hoping this new plan works.  My baby already seems much more satisfied and has pretty much been in a milk coma all day :P  I can't express how relieved I am to have my baby back on the breast!

Also loved the support aspect, I read on her earlier this week that if more boys grew up in a culture that emphasized the importance and really supported nursing mom's , there would not be the taboo on feeding your baby in public.  Good read of an article!

She and her husband love him and I was in need of a check up.  The pretty much first thing he did was see that I was taking prenatal vitamins and asked why.  I said, ""I am still breastfeeding.""  He said ""STILL?!?!  How long do you plan to continue?"" I had told him my daughter turned one last week.  I then said I'd like to continue until at least two years since that is the recommendation by the WHO.  He asked me what the WHO was and then said that wasn't their recommendation.  He said ""There is no nutritional value after one year.""  I said, ""That's like saying vegetables are only good for you until you're 5.  It doesn't make sense.""  He said, ""The nutrients go down the longer you do it.""  I said, ""My research says different.""  At this point I am flushed, shaky and on the verge of tears.  The exchange went on a little longer with him basically telling me it was only a psychological thing at this point to which I didn't disagree but said it's not just the connection that makes me want to continue.  My daughter is not ready and her pediatrician is fully supportive of us continuing as long as both baby and mom are willing. 

I wasn't prepared for such opposition.  In the past year I haven't had any one IRL challenge my decision other than my mother who I calmly and thoroughly explained my position.  I may have to see this doctor again following some tests and would like to be able to provide him some information in regards to breastfeeding since he is so quick to toss around incorrect information.

BUT I have amazing news. I think we have finally turned the corner. 

After losing too much weight and not pooping enough week 1, we started supplementing with formula on Lactation Nurse #1's orders. She wasn't very nice or helpful, so we ditched her and got Lactation Nurse #2 who was awesome. She helped us work on latching with my big, flat nipples and counseled that it would just take some time. My supply was awful because of the inadequate stimulation despite pumping 8x a day. None of the herbs work, but domperidone definitely does.

I'm now happy to report that we have been formula free for 3 weeks. We have been without supplemental bottles for a week. The only bottles he gets are while I'm at work. At home I'm nursing every 2-3 hours, except overnight. He's mostly sleeping through the night. I have a stash of frozen milk in the fridge. I pump in the morning after feeding, when I'm at work, and then before bed. Not pumping a bizillion times during the day on the weekend makes me so much happier and calm. 

I'm SO proud of myself for sticking it out. It was the hardest and most disheartening thing I ever had to deal with. I wish I were exaggerating but I'm not. I've never not been able to do something if I put my mind to it... and this FINALLY worked, 12 weeks later. So if you're ready to quit, keep your chin up, it does get easier. I didn't believe it either when I read posts saying it would, but it does. 

If you're in the trenches now, here's what I did to stay sane
* drink a ton of water and Gatorade. Whatever is in Gatorade seemed to boost my supply. 
* Remember to eat. Protein bars are quick and easy. 
* Toss the damn boppy or wait and use it for tummy time. Get a My Brest Friend. 
* Inhousepharmacy.biz is quick, easy, and doesn't require an Rx for domperidone. I could have gotten my Rx filled at a compounding pharmacy but it would have been 3x more expensive. 
* Don't quit today. Give yourself permission to quit tomorrow. It'll give you time to think and calm down. If setting goals 3-6 months out seems too much (it did for me), make your goal to get to the end of the day. 
* Pump parts will survive being thrown. Pumpin Pals flanges are way more comfortable and don't suck your nipple all the way down the tube. 
* Any breastmilk is better than none, but formula is better than a stressed-out, anxiety ridden mom. If you can only feed once a day for 10 minutes right now, so be it. Just keep practicing the latch when you and baby are calm and able and then do what you need to do to feed the baby without feeling guilty.

Dr. Phil seemed to side with the audience members saying that attachment parenting is smothering and abusive. He did say that a child's immune system isn't fully developed until they are six years old and that is why some experts recommend extended breast feeding. Dr. Sears jumped on it saying that that is exactly right but the woman opposing him (I forget her name, sorry!) said that children build immunity by playing in the dirt, not breast feeding. A woman in the audience said that it was disgusting and several people said that attachment parenting is abusive and leads to adults who don't know the word no and who have separation anxiety and other issues. A woman who was raised in an attachment parenting home said that she didn't recommend it because she didn't know the word no at 37 years old. I'm not doing a great job recapping it, I was busy chasing my son around. :) 

I will say that I practice attachment parenting and I love it. I cosleep and baby wear and I plan to breast feed for as long as he needs to. It's sad that people are so ignorant about it. I'm not abusing my child I am giving him what he needs when he needs it. The whole point of it is to raise independent stable children who become self sufficient adults. And breast feeding is so good for babies and children, why should we stop giving it to them? At that age they do it maybe once or twice a week.

Seriously, I was up all night worrying about a plugged duct.  Last time it happened to me several of my ducts shut down and my milk production dropped badly in that boob (less than a quarter oz at each pumping.).  I worked so hard over the past month to get it back up and finally got it to almost a full oz per feeding.  I was crushed, thinking I was going to have to start all over again.  I was seriously considering giving up on my right boob altogether and just letting the left one take care of business (I've also had problems with blebs my right boob... so trying to build my supply with a recurring bleb was a painful process.)

When she woke up this morning I just broke down and cried.  I figured I'd offer her the ""bad"" boob first, and maybe for the last time, because I was just so sick of it.  She usually fusses horribly at that boob too.  She's always hated it.  But this morning, she laid there on her boppy pillow waiting patiently me to unlatch my bra, and instead of fussing, she went straight to work.  She latched on super hard, and started kneading my boob like dough.  After a few min of this weird behavior, I felt whatever it was let go and my boob drained!

My husband is a pretty intimidating looking guy, especially in comparison to the scrawny manager so when the manager walked over to say something my husband looked at him and asked if there was a problem and he walked away.

I will set about making a freezer stash with dedication now, I promise.) and I was close to seeing if he would take a little hypoallergenic formula.

But brain wave! I remembered people saying that fenugreek makes milk smell powerfully of maple syrup - so I ran out to buy it hoping it would disguise the taste. And it worked! I'm not off the amoxicillin until Sunday, but overnight he's practically up to drinking a normal amount again.

My little man still has not completly mastered ""boobie drinking"", but we're still on it. He does have a problem with a tongue or lip tie. When i asked my midwife about it, she told me she already checked him out - she knew it could be a problem but it is none in our case. 
I also received helpful tipps and tricks from a wonderful lactation consultant.

Right now i'm almost exclusively pumping, but i managed to increase my output to &gt;800ml (27oz) each day. Some days it's enough, some days he still gets a small amount (30-120ml / 1-4oz) of formula. I can live with that. At least he gets what he needs and most of it is boobie milk. And i know that if i should get him to latch correctly someday, he'll get as much milk as he needs from my breast.

My lactation consultant advised us to switch to the Medela Calma when we feed breastmilk - that way he learns to suck in order to get the breastmilk. I can see he's having trouble getting the milk but eventually making it. He loses the nipple very often or accidently pushes it out of his mouth, only to grab it back again. Ugh, i'm quite happy that he can learn with the calma and doesn't abuse my nipple right now. Gives them some time to heal...

Anyways. We've found a way to feed him as much breastmilk as possible and when we both are relaxed &amp; happy, we train drinking from a real boobie.

http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/17dfl4/serious_latch_issues_help/

So my nipples are both cracked and bloody, and I've been going crazy. Last night my 10 day old decided to start eating every hour and a half, and by 4 am I had a meltdown... Bawling because the pain was so bad every time he nursed. 

Today we made it a priority to go to the Breastfeeding Clinic at our hospital. They were so amazing! I wish that I had gone there before we were discharged. 

They showed me how to latch him differently - basically hold his neck with one hand and bring his chin into your boob so his face is at a 45 degree angle. The nipple should be at nose level. With the other hand sandwich your boob an inch or two above the aereola. Wait for a wide mouth and try to tuck your boob in so that your nipple hits the roof of the babies mouth. 

Then! Take your hand off your boob and put it behind baby's back so you're cuddling him. Pull him in tight and close to you, tummy against your tummy. Let his head rest on your arm but let him move his head if he wants. He can readjust to get a better latch. Trust him to know what works.

Leaning back really helps to get comfortable and will help the baby fix the latch if it's not quite right. 

This is a lot of instruction that was opposite what the midwives told me. They said that 60 seconds or so of stabbing pain was normal when he first latched. Now there is NO PAIN. I was crying from happiness. 

I hope that helps some of you. Pm me if you don't quite understand (it's hard to write it out to make sense).

We get sent home, where I begin having a lot of trouble getting boy to latch. Lots of screaming and crying happens, from both me and boy. We go in for our first post partum check up, and I'm practically shouted at about boy's weight loss. He's down a pound and a half from his birth weight. Instead of talking to me about my breastfeeding, I get formula bullied to me, and I, an emotional wreck and feeling guilty, give it to boy, along with any milk I've desperately tried to pump.

Not wanting to give up, I schedule another appointment with a different LC. She recognizes right away that boy is tongue tied. Why the other ones didn't check for this, I'll never know. LC sends us to an EN&amp;amp;T doctor, who basically talks us out of it, saying it's an unnecessary procedure. I should have demanded it anyway, but I didn't. I was crazy with sleep deprivation and an emotional wreck, and I caved to this doctor's ignorance.

Back at home, husband, who has been a pillar of support through all of this, says fuck it and goes outside our insurance network, since we're not getting the help we need from our doctors. He finds a doctor who specializes in tongue tie, we go, she snips. Easy peasy.

Or so I thought. Still having problems with latching. Husband again steps up and finds an LC that does house calls. This woman shows up like the freakin Breastfeeding Fairy and after an hour I am breastfeeding my son. I bawled as he gulped down milk. We got it.

It wasn't all smooth sailing, but we're still going strong with no plans to stop anytime soon. Breastfeeding has been one of the most amazing things I've ever done, aside from creating with my husband the little guy currently nodding off in my arms after eating.

If I learned anything from this, it's that I need to stand up for myself and my (our) needs. Thankfully my husband got excellent new insurance, so we're free of that lousy network. We're very happy with our new pediatrician. Boy is happy and healthy. That's why we do this, yeah?

tl;dr: after a rocky start, I have breastfed my boy for six months, with no plans to stop any time soon!

I have an 8 month old daughter.  Normally I work from home and take care of her at the same time, but this week I have a conference to attend.  The only space for me to pump was in an empty conference room so I went in there and shut both doors.  Unfortunately, while they were locked to the outside technically, hotel personnel could still get in with a key.

One man didn't know I was in there so he unlocked the door and let himself in... Poor unexpecting guy didn't know what hit him as I sat there pumping away.  He was mortified, he simply said, ""oh my goodness (*looks away*) I'm so sorry. (*awkward pause, then slowly backs out of the room*)"".  He couldn't make eye contact with me for a few hours after that one. :/

I just laughed and laughed.  It was incredibly awkward, but it was also pretty funny.  I figure that's the best reaction to have - to see the comical side of the situation.  :)

Give me hope?,boobiethrowaway12,21,0,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1e1rus/can_you_gals_assuage_my_fears_give_me_hope/,"Hi mommas! Using a throwaway because I am super embarrassed by my feelings and to be honest, I'm not sure what I'm expecting out of this. I'm going to try to start from the beginning, giving details so I can get your full perspective, so that might make this long. I'll try to add TL;DR at bottom.

Here's my problem: Breastfeeding was the pits for me. I had a traumatic delivery with my first baby which landed him in the NICU for over a week. When he was born, he was whisked away not breathing well. I had no skin to skin bonding and I only caught a couple of glimpses of him before they took him out of the room. I didn't see him again for two hours and then it was for five minutes before he was transferred to the neighboring hospital. I didn't even get to hold him until the next day. The first day, he was on IV fluids so I started with pumping, the next two days, I was allowed to breastfeed him, but since I wasn't producing milk yet, I used an SNS with donated milk so that he was getting the amount they required him to get and to stimulate my milk production. In the mean times I was pumping my poor nipples off and getting oh so little colostrum ([like, a drop out of each nipple after 15-20 minutes on the pump](http://imgur.com/Dsx2TvG).) The day it started making the switch to becoming milk, they inserted an NG tube (and I still don't really know why, they never said and he didn't have any trouble latching or eating on his own) and while I was definitely still pumping, I was getting all of 3-5mL if I was lucky. And that was out of both breasts. So we went another six days not being able to breastfeed because they were feeding through NG then bottles just to get him out of the hospital and home. All the while I was still pumping every 1.5-2 hours and the amount was still not increasing at all.

When we finally got him home, we tried nursing again and he would just scream and cry instead of even trying to suckle. I tried every hold, hand expressing into his mouth and he would suckle twice then go back to screaming, everything. I was so defeated and I still couldn't pump more than 7mL even after deciding to pump more. I'd pump for 15-30 minutes every hour to hour and a half maybe 3-4 times in a row, then I'd lay off for 3-4 hours and pump again. Nothing helped. I made lactation cookies, I took Fenugreek, I drank Mother's Milk Tea (shit's gross just FYI), and I took [Lactation Support](http://www.amazon.com/Gaia-Herbs-Lactation-Support-Phyto-Capsules/dp/B005ACNNKC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368155873&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lactation+supplement) all to no avail.

I felt so defeated and although my husband was supportive, his mother made a lot of crappy comments that were disheartening, to say the very least. After about 10 weeks of crying all the time, being depressed, not sleeping, and pumping with no results, I gave up. He was already on formula so what was the point in pumping so little if all of his sustenance was coming from that anyway?

He's older now, but still many times when I make a bottle, I just want to throw it at the wall. I feel so guilty for quitting. I feel betrayed by my body. It has never worked right. We struggled for years through infertility to get little man and I thought I might be able to catch one fucking break and just be able to give him the best.

Now I'm pregnant with number two and **I was wondering if there is anything I can do to... ""help"" my boobs, I guess?** I don't want to go through the disappointment or guilt or frustration again. I just want my breasts to work. Tell me straight, ladies, **is there any hope for me? Is there anything I can do?** I have a (shitty) single electric pump, **can I start trying to pump a couple of weeks before I am due to get colostrum flowing?** I have a few tricks up my sleeve this time around since I already have some experience and the #1 is: If guests in my home have nothing supportive to say, they will be removed until they can get their shit together (looking at you, MIL). Also, I have already made some lactation cookie dough and frozen it so all we'll have to do is thaw and bake. 

**Do you have any tips/tricks/success stories where #1 was horrible but #2 was easier?**

I knew you ladies would understand and share in how proud of myself I am that we haven't given up.

It started with no latch and having to go to a nipple shield within hours of him being born. I think that because of that, my milk never really came in. I've had to supplement, first with donated milk for the first week and then with formula. Every bottle of formula felt like a personal failure. After months of frustrated trying on my own, we finally got off the nipple shield with the help of a great LC at a little over 3 months.

I thought I'd give you all an update on the crazy nursing issues Miguel and I have experienced in the last 6 months. I wrote about them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/10ksvd/skinny_baby_woes_update/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/z58mc/skinny_baby_woes/) and recently noticed some people posting about tongue-tie issues, so maybe this will all help someone out. For those of you uninterested in reading the above links, a brief version of our story is as follows:

* When a newborn, baby had difficulty latching. We used a nipple shield for about three weeks. He nursed constantly, but still not effectively. 
* Baby dropped to 5th percentile by 5 months (from 50th) and stopped sleeping. Dr began to worry and sent me to the LC. 
* LC was all like, ""Holy Crap, this baby has really terrible tongue-tie!"" and advised us to see a pediatric ear, nose throat dr. 
* Our insurance was like, ""nope! you don't need an ENT!"" I was on the phone for days, and we eventually made an evaluation appointment at a children's hospital two hours away. 

Miguel is 6 months now and had his tongue-tie fixed a little after he turned 5 months. Because he was an older baby, they had to sedate him and perform the minor surgery at the hospital. They gave him some gas, clipped the tongue and cauterized it. He was under anesthesia for about 20 min total and woke up happy and ready to eat. It was a simple and relatively painless procedure. 

However, he refused the breast for about two days after that. I suppose it hurt him too much to nurse. That, and I had been giving him pumped milk in bottles so he was sort of spoiled to them. About two weeks before the surgery, I broke down and bought a Medela Pump In Style and pumped 4-6 times a day in an effort to save my supply. I honestly believe that, if it wasn't for that awesome pump, I would have dried up. I pumped maybe 2- 2.5 oz from both breasts each time. Nowhere near enough. 

About two weeks ago, my supply suddenly dropped to 1.5 oz. Maybe it was the stress of M's surgery and the hurricane. My plan was to do a nurse-at-thon all weekend with M's fixed tongue in hopes of increasing my supply but it did the opposite. I was toying with the idea of supplementing him with formula since he was sleeping badly again. I contacted the LC and she said it might be a good idea. Even though we had some formula on hand, I held out, thinking I was doing something awful if I gave it to him. I really, really, really wanted to make it to 6 months EBF. But then one night I actually heard his belly growl and that sealed the deal. I would have to supplement. It broke my heart. I cried while giving him the bottle, feeling like shit because I couldn't reach my goal. But his belly was finally full and he slept like a champ. 

At this time, the pediatrician and the LC (who are both VERY much for baby-led weaning) encouraged me to start giving Miguel high-fat baby purees  to help him gain. Again, it broke my heart to not ebf, but I needed to fatten up this kid. He LOVED the foods, though. 

Nowadays, I've been working with my LC to help deal with YET ANOTHER TOOTH (oh, the biting!), keeping baby from being too distracted to nurse (we basically have to nurse in one spot in the bedroom in silence), and getting him to prefer the breast over the bottle again (AKA, getting milk to let-down quicker). UGGGGGHHHHHH...

Right now, I'm on day 10 of domperidone, a drug used to combat nausea but also causes you to lactate. My insurance didn't cover it, and it's not approved by the FDA, but it's doing the trick. Today I pumped 4 oz from one breast! Two days ago, Miguel got milk drunk for the first time since he was a newborn. Also, today was the first time Miguel was on the breast for more than two minutes and actually came away satisfied. Next week is his weight check and we'll see where he is. I can tell he's gaining weight because his head isn't as knobbly, his wrists and thighs have creases, and his clothes are tighter. 

This ended up longer than I expected, but essentially what I'm trying to say is sometimes breastfeeding is a pain in the ass. I've been so close to quitting but only stubbornness keeps me going. I don't think I could bear the ""I told you so""s from my mom, or the disdain from my moms' groups if I switched to formula. I tried so hard to EBF for six months, but it just didn't work out. Maybe one day I'll get over having to use formula, but for right now my goal is to stop supplementing by the end of next week. Is breastfeeding worth it? I can honestly say I have no idea. I really have no idea, since he seemed equally as happy and attached while eating formula. But dammit, I'm going to keep going and hopefully make it to a year. We're slowly, but surely, getting back on track.

Fantastic news! As everyone assured me would happen, once I was hydrated again my body bounced back with a vengeance! It's as if it never dropped. Even better, my baby is so much happier at the breast that he's partially rejecting bottles when offered and more or less waits it out until I'm able to nurse him if he's hungry and there's not much there. What shocked me even more is I ran out of the domperidone this week and haven't seen a drop in supply from their absence (though I had been weaning from them as I anticipated not having more.)

My husband and I went to a breastfeeding class last night and I asked the instructor, but she made it sound like you still have to pump every time baby feeds. Edit for Clarification: If baby is taking a bottle of expressed - I still have to pump at the time baby is feeding.  So lets assume we are in the best-case scenario and already passed establishing milk supply and good latch so no nipple confusion. When do I pump, and when do I use that expressed milk? I would love for daddy to be able to take over feedings now and again – 1 a day? I want to be able to leave baby with granny for an afternoon.  My instructor said that I need to pump every time baby feeds. I’m SO confused! So even if my hubby takes a midnight feeding session, I have to get up and pump too? If I leave for an afternoon, I have to pump to maintain supply not just maybe to relieve some engorgement? My instructor last night discouraged pumping on the alternate breast for the purpose of storing milk. She said it would make your body think it has to produce enough milk for two babies and then you will become very engorged when you want to go out. Ok- so how the HECK do I ever leave baby or get expressed milk stored? She also said if Daddy takes over a feeding at night then even if I pump during the day I will endanger my milk supply and likely decrease production. What about when baby is sleeping through the night? Wouldn't that endanger my milk production if I didn't get up to pump? Sigh... I really don’t understand? How can I have heard of so many moms allowing daddy to feed too without problems? Is she just erring on the side of caution?? What about those times when granny babysits? I understand I might be uncomfortable from engorgement but does not pumping while I'm gone endanger my milk supply? Honestly - she just made me nervous that if I don't pump when baby eats, I won’t produce enough milk to reach our goal of 1 year. Help moms - can you shed some light on this for me? Thank you! 

Edit: To clarify, I will be working from home and while I hope to breastfeed most of the time anyways - there still will be times that I need to be able to have Daddy take over baby duties in the evening after he gets home so that I can finish up my work projects, and I'm sure there will be some nights it would be a wonderful treat to be able to sleep while Daddy takes over a nighttime session. Or lastly, when Granny comes to babysit for an afternoon or evening. Or Heck - What happens if I head out grocery shopping and leave little one at home with daddy. WHAT ON EARTH DO I DO?

Or drinking cow's milk.

Or drinking from a cup.

Solid foods! When she's eating all her meals with a fork and knife, surely she'll wean . . . right?

Okay, maybe when she starts socializing with other kids and sees that they don't nurse, THEN she'll give it up.

Nope. I am still nursing my almost-three-year-old. She loves it, I don't mind it at all, but people are always shocked if they find out. (We only nurse at home - in the mornings and in the evening.) ""When are you going to wean that kid? Isn't she a little old for this?""

I don't know what to do. We've tried extolling the virtues of being a ""Big Girl"" (NOT shaming), offering plenty of alternatives, a simple reward system . . . the list is growing. The thing is, I don't mind. I don't mind a bit. She doesn't seem to care. Are we weaning for the right reason? The only reason I'm trying to move in that direction is that I'm scared it might hinder her emotional growth when she starts going off to pre-school and kindergarten - I don't want her to think she's ""different"".

We've tried talking about it - ""You're a big girl now, and that's so cool! Big girls get to do all sorts of fun stuff! But, usually, babies drink from boobies; not big girls."" She just told me that she is a big girl, but she likes boobie milk. She's also really polite about it. She asks to nurse with a ""please"" and finishes with a ""thank you"". Sometimes she even pats them and kisses the good-bye before I stuff them back in my bra! She's a cool kid. I just don't want her to have any difficulties because I should have been more assertive about weaning.

People have suggested things like putting lemon juice or hot sauce on my nipples, drawing a scary face, or even spanking her when she tries to latch on. I'm not cool with those things. I think it would be pretty upsetting to have this comforting, relaxing, quiet, nourishing time with mommy suddenly become a Bad Thing.

We're back!!!,glittr_grl,27,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1965um/update_to_1_year_old_on_nursing_strike_were_back/,"Update to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/18tjez/let_my_1_year_old_spend_the_night_at_grannys_and/). Long but I'm so relieved! Thought it could maybe help encourage someone else. 

It took 5 days to come back from the strike, which is better than the two weeks when my oldest went on one. But it was rough even so. 

Monday night he first refused, and I though he was full from dinner and overtired and still adjusting to being back from his trip to Granny's. No big deal. Tuesday morning worried me, and Tuesday night is when I realized he was well and truly striking and I feared for being able to continue breastfeeding. Earlier that evening he had *almost* been willing to latch on but then he spit it out and turned away. When I got him home he was fast asleep and didn't protest but was too far gone to nurse, either.  I ended up sobbing on the stairs just outside his room after he squirmed and fussed when I tried to put him back down when he woke later in the night, obviously missing his routine of nursing to sleep but refusing to do so, leaving me at an impasse. I finally rocked and sang until he went down, and then went and cried.

Wednesday morning he still vehemently refused to even be put in cradle hold and cried the whole time it took to get a bottle warm. That evening I put the big kids to bed and tried taking a bath with him. He loved the bath but it didn't seem to do any good nursing-wise. We hung out with him in a diaper and me topless for a while and he played (and pinched!) my boobs but still wasn't interested. We had a good snuggle before bed though and minimal crying and I thought I might be able to deal with him not nursing if I couldn't work it out, as long as he was snuggly at bedtime.

Thursday in the night he still just wanted to snuggle but fussed and squirmed until he put himself in cradle hold, at which point he went right to sleep, which got my hopes up. I decided to only give him cold (pumped) milk in a cup if he wouldn't nurse, and he took it ok. That night he let me cradle him again, but turned away when I offered the breast. 

Friday for some reason I got really depressed again. I didn't even try to nurse that morning, just brought him his cup with the milk from pumping the day before. Our non-nursing routine was getting easier, but my supply was dropping and my nipples hurt from tripling my pumping sessions, and the whole day while I was apart from him I was just down and apathetic about everything. I got home earlier than usual and spent the whole evening with him, which helped my mood a little, and once again didn't even try to offer the breast at bedtime, which made him less fussy. Then I went and pumped and just sobbed because I only got 2 oz where Monday night I got 7. I cried to my husband about wanting to give up. For the first time in over a year, I didn't even bother to sleep in a bra because I felt so empty.

Then Saturday! He woke around 5 am and I'd just been singing him back to sleep at that waking time so I tried, but he was hungry-fussing and turning toward me. He didn't like our normal singing/cuddle positions and turned toward cradle. Not expecting much and bracing myself to go downstairs for the precious few ounces I had in the fridge, I lifted my shirt and offered AND HE TOOK IT! Like that's what he'd waiting for all along, the little stinker. I was afraid I was so empty he'd get impatient and mad, but he worked until he got letdown, and kept nursing long after until we finally switched sides. I probably nursed him for a solid hour, twice on each side, before he let go and fell asleep. It was an answer to prayer, and I told myself if he never nursed again at least I had that sweet memory to hold onto. 

But he nursed again later that morning, and that evening, and at bedtime. And again this morning, and at nap time. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we made it through, even tho I had to be away from him tonight. So happy that we'll be able to continue, but treating every day like it could be the last, just in case. 

**TL;DR** My 12 month old went on 5 day nursing strike, and I was getting depressed and worried that he might have weaned. My supply was dropping. Things improved when I stopped trying to nurse for a couple days and switched to cold pumped milk in a cup when he normally would have nursed. He started back like nothing had happened.

Also my husband was awesome and SO supportive through the whole ordeal. So mad props to him. &lt;3",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_1965um,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1965um/update_to_1_year_old_on_nursing_strike_were_back/,

She was at a loss and said that I would need to take action now and start pumping and taking herbs.  She also was really nice and decided not to charge me for her services because at the end of the hour interview and consultation she wasn't able to help LO latch on and we determined that I wasn't making more than about 2 oz every few hours maybe.  I went home very depressed and down.  I called another lactation consultant and she suggested that I start now and do everything I can to get it back.  I took a boob-cation (as my husband called it) with LO and spent all day in bed with her letting her breastfeed whenever she wanted and however long she wanted.  I took baths with her in dim light.  I am taking herbs (Fenugreek and Blessed Thistle).  I power pumped after every feeding for an hour for two days.  And now, today I am very lucky to say that it's coming back!  LO has been eating well, :).  I almost switched to formula twice because LO would scream and cry every time I fed her and we both were miserable.  Having a positive attitude also helped me out a lot.  It's funny but I would imagine flowing rivers of milk while I fed her and that not only relaxed me but I think it's helped me visualize it coming back. 

Thank you all for your advice.  For those with a low milk supply I suggest to keep feeding your LO whenever they want and however long they want.

It's super embarrassing, messy, and since I always have my baby, I never carry an extra shirt. 

The in laws had the baby overnight, for the first time, and I just didn't have pumping down as well as I thought I had. All day today I fought to try to empty my breasts, but I don't know if it was stress or what, but I just kept lactating through shirt after shirt, even just shortly after pumping. 

I went to go pick up my son and wore bra pads, my pumping bra (all my other ones were dirty), and a shirt and I swear it looked like my son had peed two long streaks down the front of my shirt in less than 10 minutes of holding him. 

My MIL was horrified, which just added to the stress and embarrassment. She let me borrow a shirt, but told me to keep it... like my milk is toxic or something... just wanted to crawl into a hole and not come out. 

Edit: Thanks ladies! I'm sure my MIL didn't mean to come off as disgusted as she did. She's a nice lady, and I think she just didn't know how to react. The whole breastfeeding thing has kind of been a struggle with us. Not so much physically, but just getting support rather than hassle from people. I really have had too much on my plate and just needed to get this off my chest &lt;3 Y'all are wonderful &lt;#

I'm also 11 weeks pregnant. She's still been nursing on demand and averages 5-10 times a day. Always to go to sleep for nap and bed. Two days ago she nursed around 7 times and the next morning when she went to nurse she had a bad latch and only made loud noises. It made her sad that it was not working right. That whole day every time she tried she just bit me and moved her tongue around then got off and said all done. She seems really confused as to why it's not going as it has. She went all day today without it and without a nap. She tried this evening for bed and again just bit down, moved her tongue, and got off and cried. What could be causing this and is there anything I can do to help? Can a toddler go from nursing a lot to literally losing her latch over night? I was not ready for this and I'm not sure she was either.",,False,self,t5_2rdj4,False,,,True,t3_1kmxbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1kmxbz/toddler_lost_her_latch_over_night/,
