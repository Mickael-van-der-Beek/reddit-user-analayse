[X-post from r/hydro],byronnn,26,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/1jh2wg/diy_led_lights_test_results_xpost_from_rhydro/,"So I've been working on a system for growing kale indoors and as part of that I've put together and bought some LED lights.  
SuperAngryGuy was a big help through PM and [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/1gfyvs/are_these_led_lights_any_good/).  
  
I started off looking on eBay for cheap LED grow lights and ended up buying [this 18W light](http://www.ebay.com/itm/TOPGROW-6X3W-Series-LED-Grow-Light-Lamp-for-flower-plant-herbs-vegetables-/111094734982?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEWNX%3AIT&amp;nma=true&amp;si=bKz8%252BpGf1R4XbeKLRa2igeD82vE%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc) and [this 27W light](http://www.ebay.com/itm/BestGrow-6RED-3BLUE-9X3W-High-Power-LED-Grow-Light-Lamp-For-Flowering-Plants-/111096658016?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEWNX%3AIT&amp;nma=true&amp;si=bKz8%252BpGf1R4XbeKLRa2igeD82vE%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;rt=nc). The problem with these is that they do not actually consume the amount of power listed. I contacted the seller for the emitter information and by my best guess they use about 35% of the listed power, which makes them quite efficient but also very expensive to grow anything significant.  
  
The lights I ended up building are made from cheap eBay [emitters](http://www.ebay.com/itm/380471971154?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) and [drivers](http://www.ebay.com/itm/111083822403?var=410179871603&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) attached with [thermal adhesive](http://www.ncix.com/products/?sku=23642&amp;promoid=1062) so a CPU cooler. I used CPU coolers that were on sale ($12/each) and powered the fan with a [DC adapter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/200798800333?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649). I used a 40W driver on a 50W emitter and a 50W driver on a 60W to increase the working life of the emitters. [Album is here.](http://imgur.com/a/G3Hc2)
  
This summer I'm working at an agricultural research station and have access to a PAR light meter so I tested my lights. I pointed the lights directly at the sensor from 18 and 9 inches. [Here are the results.](http://i.imgur.com/OFemJEZ.png) I was told that this sensor is not particularly accurate below 500 which might explain some of the unexpected results.
  
The eBay lights look to be more efficient than the lights I built which is likely due to them being so significantly under driven. The 40W light did better than the 50W light which may be due to bad luck with cheap LEDs or me reading the meter inaccurately.  
  
As per [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17ny46/plant_lighting_intensity/) I'm aiming for 500+ uMol/meter^2 /sec on 4 square feet so these lights should do well if kept less than 9 inches above the canopy.

This year, I decided to start 9 varieties of peppers (hot and sweet), as well as get an early start on herbs and lettuce with some indoor pots under lights. Last year I bought a HydroFarm grow light, 2 seedling heat mats, and ParkSeed.com seed starting cells/trays/domes. This year, I expanded my set up with a cheap shelving unit and some shop lights with daylight compact fluorescent bulbs. I started lettuce seeds in old plastic lettuce containers with holes punched in the bottom and used the lids as water trays. If the lettuce does well under the lights, I plan to grow it indoors year-round--outside, I get so many bugs and slugs, it's almost not worth the effort. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to seeing how all my little seedlings fare this season!

I've had it for about 2 years and the person I bought it from had had it for quite a long time as well. I suspect it's 4-5 years old.

I noticed about a week ago that some freshly formed flower buds, less than a millimeter in size, turn black and fall off the pepper plants. Today I noticed a couple of slightly bigger ones had fell off too, without first turning black.

At first I thought it was because the pots were too small, so I gave them some much bigger ones a few days ago but they keep doing this. Larger buds seem to be doing fine but I don't want them all to fall off, I gave them a bit of fertilizer mixed in the water once a week before I moved them into bigger pots with fresh soil so could it be because I gave them too much/too little of it?

I have made a few attempts in the past to start an indoor herb garden. I lived in an apt building that only had a northern exposure and didn't get much light, and what few successes I had (cilantro, basil) were eaten by my puppy so I gave up. 

My current place has a western exposure. I seeded some thyme, rosemary and basil two weeks ago, and so far only the thyme has sprouted. It initially seemed to be doing pretty well, but then after watering (I hadn't watered in 5 days and the soil was quite dry), half of them kind of fell over and shriveled up. The rest seem to just be kind of hanging on, growing at a snail's pace if they are growing at all. 

Rosemary I have now learned is hard to grow from seed, so I am writing that off. But Basil seems like it shouldn't be so hard to grow, yet not a seed has germinated. After two weeks with nary a sprout, I sowed the other half of the seed packet this weekend, a bit shallower, and want to try keeping the soil more moist until they germinate. Will this do the trick? 

But over all, it seems like I am missing some knowledge on how to grow things, and searching online yields only very shallow information. Are there any books/resources I should know about for a beginning gardener?

My family has a large aloe plant that has been very happy for a long time. It has grown to over 18'' (maybe even two feet) tall in a relatively short time. It lives inside in a solarium with some healthy hibiscus, Xmas cacti, jade plants. It has had a good life, but recently we have seen it start to droop. First, the large base limbs folded near the main shoot. Now the entire plant is tipping over to one side. 

The only thing that I can say may be causing it is there is a little bit of white-ish fuzzy material on the top of the soil. Maybe mold? I don't know how to get rid of it, but suspect it is too late. Maybe not though.

I just got my first apartment and have been growing as much stuff as I can and know nearly nothing about what I'm doing. If anyone could answer a few questions that may or may not be silly:



~~Am I hurting my peace lillies by waiting until they droop to water them? If I keep their soil as moist as they like I end up with tiny flies who like to hang out near the roots.~~

~~Will something like ivy dig holes into my walls if I put hanging near them? (since it's a climber)~~

~~I've heard you can regrow green onions from a few inches of their base with just water in a jar, and keep using the shoots that grow. Wouldn't they become less and less tasty if the only nutrients they've got is water?~~

Kay, thanks guys!

Edit: If I cover the dirt in perlite to keep out fungus gnats, will my peace lily still be able to grow outwards and form new crowns? I'd rather a few little buggers than keep my plants small.

Feel free to redirect me if it's not.

I have been trying to grow several plants in pots in my apartment, and most of them do pretty well. I have an enormous basil plant, and some chives that seem fine. 

The problem first started when I brought home some loose-leaf lettuce to plant. It grew well at first, but then suddenly the tops just pulled out of the ground; the roots had been eaten away. I started noticing these tiny flying insects around my pots. The basil doesn't seem disturbed, nor do my decorative plants, but then I tried to plant some green onion roots from the green onions I had purchased at my local market. Again, they grew well for a week or two and then died because the roots had been eaten out.

About a month or two ago, I bought some seeds for loose-leaf lettuce and jalapeno plants. The lettuce shoots came up just fine, they seemed to be doing well, until I watered them one day and they easily toppled over. Now I worry for the jalapeno shoots. 

I can't describe the bugs or get a picture, so I hoped that describing what they are doing would be more helpful than nothing. I don't really know what to do about the problem. I tried to search through a few stores for a pesticide that wouldn't be harmful for me if I put it on my edible plants, but I don't really know where to look.

To take advantage of this, capillary matting was invented as a material that never rots and can pull up water from a reservoir and allow constant moisture to be available to any plant that touches it.

I bought a few of [this finished product](http://www.amazon.com/Tierra-Derco-GP70-Large-Self-Watering/dp/B001D1ITRG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358394792&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tierra+derco+self+watering) from amazon and love them, but you can buy the matting super cheap and build your own self watering system for next to nothing, if you prefer. Some designs have multi gallon reservoirs that can go months without being refilled.

Great thing about this is that it encourages good downward root growth and the pots only get what they need,so they are not overwatered. My plants growth have been many times faster than when they were watered from the top.

(cross-post from /r/gardening),small-medium-atlarge,9,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/1ad8qb/advice_on_growing_beansseeds_indoors_for/,"I'm taking a grad class on science education and, naturally, one component of this course is how to conduct an experiment with plants. I have to submit my finished project on April 7, so I hope this is enough time to see some decent seedling growth before then. At the gardening store, a woman working there recommended green beans as a quick-growing plant. I also decided to go back and get a ""back-up plant"" in case something goes wrong with the beans. The guy who I spoke to when I went there the second time recommended corn as a back-up.

To be clear, I only need to see some observable growth so I can take comparison photos of my variable and control groups and I am not necessarily going to be transplanting these plants (if they do well, I'll see if my mother would like them for her garden). I am just concerned about screwing this up since there is a time constraint and it's for a grade; I have never planted anything beyond helping my mother with her garden occasionally. Searching the internet yields so many different responses to a few questions, so I thought I'd try to get a consensus here.

Basic info:

* My main plant is ""Earliserve Bush Bean"" with maturity at 45 days and my back-up plant (in case something goes wrong with beans) is ""Early Sunglow Corn"" with maturity at 65 days.

* The variable for this experiment is soil type. I will plant 4 beans in containers with potting soil and 4 beans in containers with regular dirt I dug up from the yard. (Repeating this also for the back-up plant, corn.)

* I live in the Hudson Valley in NY and unfortunately it's not been incredibly sunny lately. Still pretty cold too-- mostly highs in 40's and lows in the 30's. The weather this past week was mostly cloudy, partly-sunny on some days. These plants will be in the window of sunniest room in the house, but I'm concerned about heat (even though I keep it 65-67 degrees) and light because of recent weather.

That said, what can I do to ensure the best results (not necessarily for eventual consumption) and simply be able to see some measurable growth I can record and describe?

1) Do I sprout the beans in a damp paper towel in a ziplock bag? Corn too? Or soak them? For how long before planting? I have no idea and have read conflicting things about this, re: mold and degradation of seed.

2) Do I find a supplementary heat source for growing indoors? Use some sort of enclosed planter to create a ""greenhouse"" environment?

3) I have to measure and record everything-- including amount of water and how frequently. One person recommended misting with a spray bottle to not disturb the seeds early on. Another person said simple watering from a measuring cup is fine. Again, mixed responses.

Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated-- I am working in a group with 2 other grad students (one is doing the Powerpoint and the other is researching plant growth) and I am nervous about messing this up since I am responsible for the actual plants. Help! :-)

There is one window (33inches, 2.75 ft) in the front of the room that faces due south. On the window I plan to put up three rows of plants:  a mixture of chives, basil, rosemary, thyme, and cilantro.  Can these plants survive on natural light?  There is one tree about 50ft away and the room is well lit most of the day. 

The plants at the window will grow in boxes, likely plastic or wooden

I have an empty wall, the 8.3ft one, that I'd like to grow yellow squash, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, peppers, spinach and, romaine lettuce. I was thinking of doing this over three tiers, about 5ft each, with the tomatoes and peppers on the bottom; squash and zucchini in the middle, and spinach and romain on top. All three tiers would have lights installed. 

Do these different vegetables need different types of light for optimum production? Also, how many lights are needed to support each tier? From my research it seems the T5 lights would be best; I would buy the 4ft ones. 

Would it be better to have two tiers? More room for the tomatoes/peppers/squash to grow?

The 'grow wall' containers will be split:  tomatoes and peppers will grow in their own 5 gallon  containers the squash and zucchini will share a box, as will the spinach and romaine. How many squash/zucchini plants can I fit in a 1.5x5ft box?  Likewise, how many spinach and romain plants can fit in the same size box?

This isn't a picture of my plant (thanks, Google) but it perfectly illustrates the problem I'm having with my basil right now. I have seen a few little light-colored bugs hanging out in the soil before, and this morning I noticed two on one of the leaves. These bugs are SO SMALL that I cannot possibly see them if they are not moving. The new leaves look great for the first day or so maybe, and then they are all covered in this mottled brown junk (and I think they're becoming a bit more translucent as well?).

I had a bird's nest fern and an autumn fern that were also infested with these ridiculously tiny bug/mite creatures. I gave up on the bird's nest fern after almost a year of no growth, and my autumn fern is down to one last small, underdeveloped frond. I separated it from the dead stuff and thoroughly washed the leaves and roots off, but the bugs are back! (albeit in smaller numbers) I've also tried misting my plants with diluted Dawn, but the damage hasn't stopped progressing on my basil and my fern isn't making any new fronds.

What in the world are these bugs, and how can I stop them from destroying all of my plants?

Thanks!

I noticed that there are some [holes](http://i.imgur.com/a6Q4R3s.jpg) in it probably from bugs, but I haven't seen any specifically. 

If this plant is infested or diseased, will it spread to my other plants?

I don't need extra room for cooling or circulation, just a cheap mechanical timer will handle the puny electrical load without risk of fire, and when the plant sprouts up to the light, it doesn't immediately burn from the heat.  I kept the plant a good 2 inches from the light the entire way through its life for maximum exposure, which tropical plants love. 

I harvested right before Christmas break since I don't have any kind of automated watering system ([Arduino anyone?](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/arduino-powered-plant-can-water-itself/)). You can see from the reviews that plants love this thing but it has some QA issues.  I did have a loose wire plug, but that was easy to fix with a Phillips-head screwdriver and just plugging in an internal jumper plug. 

Tropical plants prefer sandy, slightly acidic soil so make sure you get it right when you start and all you should need is water after that. I used pete, sand and horticultural charcoal mix. I grew them in the winter in my bedroom which worked out great because I had an electric radiator going 24/7 for my bedroom specifically, keeping me and the plant at the preferred toasty temperature. Some wire shelving in my apartment closet made it a cinch to setup the light and adjust it as needed.

The two ferns have by far the highest number of mites, and they haven't been growing much at all in the past year.

* Horizontal or vertical garden?
* For herbs do you need hydroponics?
* Best herbs to start? Basil is not so easy to find here.
* Any love for spring onions?
* Which vegetables and herbs are easily replicable (onions, garlic)? I mean taking a part of it and make it grow again.
* What are the recommended plants to have?
* What space should I have to get something usable. Meaning enough to make some sauce or use in my cooking.
* How long should I look for before it starts getting somewhere? 2 months?
* What is the best resource(s) for Indoor growing?

In my current apartment I have about 5 plants all doing pretty so-so. All of them are placed in two large east-facing windows. My problem is that none of them seem to be thirsty; they drink water insanely slowly or not at all. I've even left one plant unwatered for a month, and when I touched the soil, it was still wet.

- Yes I'm using pots with drains
- Yes I'm watering ""through"" the soil and letting it run out the bottom (meaning, not topping off with a cup of water every day)
- None of the plants has root rot nor fungus 

Is it lack of light? Wrong soil? Wintertime stubbornness? 

Regardless of the cause, how do you deal with it? Do you seriously just let the plants go without it for weeks on end, if they're not drinking what they're given?

I live in the Portland Oregon area and I am just now getting into indoor gardening. I have a detached garage I plan I growing a few plants in. My plan was to create a “grow closet” within the garage using panda film and some wood. My question is, since it is pretty cold outside, would this be worth setting up or would it get too cold in the garage to grow anything? I was thinking that the combination of the closet and the grow lights should keep the confined space warm enough to grow some herbs, pepper plants, onions, lettuce etc etc… 

Any thoughts or suggestions? 

Thanks!

Probably not good, right?

I know the pot size I need but I can't figure out what brands to buy for soil and I thought the directions I was given would be helpful to me.

They aren't.

So in the pamphlet I got, it says to start with just a generic commercially available potting mix without fertilizer or wetting agents and to mix with redwood shavings, cedar wood shavings, or perlite.
I was thinking Miracle Gro but those all have wetting agents or fertilizer as far as I can tell. Espoma Organic potting mix also seems like it might not work.

I'm confused, please recommend some good brands. I live in San Francisco and have a nice south facing window for good sun exposure, I mist the leaves twice, daily, and water the trees in their current state when the shavings it's sitting in are dry. /ihavenoideawhatimdoing
