I'm guessing it's MCK/SCK/GND/DATA - so... from the white papers the chips can only handle 16bit 44.1k signals, and I2S left justified.. and I found this [yummy little board](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271129714452) that has 4 SPDIF inputs and outputs I2S in 16 bit left justified. 

Looks like I just stumbled onto a really nice fully balanced digital preamp project. I ordered the board this morning - I'll let yall know how it turns out in a few weeks.

I Used the Sure tk2050 2x100W board (AA-AB32186) which has 2x tp2050 and a tc2000 to achieve 2x100 wat @ 4 ohms
It actually turned out pretty nice and it works well, but since this is my first build and  being new to diyaudio I figured I probably did some things horribly wrong.

For a case I used a small old dell pc.

Powered by 2 dell psu's in series which have 11A rating on their 12V lines, should give the board 24V 11A

Static noise is absent, which is good. The thing that bothers me is that it starts clipping faster than I'd like it to and I have no idea where this problem originates and I was hoping you guys could give me some pointers on where to look. The clipping occurs when the bass is cranked up loud, the clipping led starts following the drum and I can also hear it clipping.

- Could it be that the vcc and ground lines are too thin?, I tried measuring the voltage across the board, it never drops below 22V but it's hard to tell with a digital Multimeter, I don't have an analogue one.
- Are the computer psu's even coping?, I know they should be able to provide 11A, but they weren't made for stuff like this so should I add a huge capacitor of some sort?
- Could the speakers be the source of the problem? one I use is 6 ohms, the other doesn't even have a rating, tomorrow I might be able to try 2 B&amp;W dm310's which should be good.

Tl:dr; Should I be ashamed of my first amp, improvements?

Edit: Thanks for all of the info and pointers you guys gave me. for now I ordered an analogue multimeter to find out how much the voltage drops at Vcc and to help make an educated guess on capacitor choice for the supply rails. For caps I am aiming for the sweet spot where there is little voltage drop on the rails and no need for a soft-start circuit. 
Right now I'm thinking of adding another PSU  to supply the board with 36V because T-amps like volts. 36V is above the sure rating, so I'm checking the schematics and the board itself for components that fail at this Vcc, so far so good. When I add the third PSU I'll also rewire the rest of the supply unit with heavier gauge wire.

I wanted a nice pair of loudspeakers for my desktop rig that I could run off a low-powered amp so I decided on the Overnight Sensation Kit from PartsExpress. These things have got some stellar reviews and they seemed to be priced low enough that I wouldn’t be screwed if I messed up during the building process.

[Here's the album](http://imgur.com/a/yqeOv#MqiB5)

The kit came with just about everything I needed. I also got a 2-pair set of binding posts, a cheap board for Radioshack, and some dampening material. These knock-down cabinets have already been pre-cut and pre-sanded which made my life a lot easier as I didn’t have to work out the baffle. Keep in mind I used a lot of (my dad’s) tools during the process so if you’re a first time builder with no tools you’re going to have to get some. Specifically a soldering iron, solder, electric drill, varnish, wood glue, a roll of 22awg, and a handful of screws.

First were the crossovers. In the instructional video, the guy made floating connections and then just glued down all the components to a wooden slab. I recommend using a board as it’s easier to make connections for when there’s multiple leads at a single junction. I drilled some holes in the board so I could screw it down to the bottom of the cabinet later. I used ties to hold down the inductors and used the wire to make the connections to the binding post terminals and the speaker terminals. I used spade crimps for the binding posts and I used a sort of “slide-in” crimp for the speaker terminals. This was a lot easier than having to solder directly to the speaker terminals. Make sure to test your crossover with the drivers before you assemble the cabinet. I found that I had switched the two resistors on one of the boards and had to desolder to correct my mistake.

Now the cabinets. As I said they were already precut perfectly so no need to do much work. I did some light sanding with 200 grit paper. Then I applied some very light varnish to darken the wood a bit. Most other versions of these speakers that I’ve seen used a much darker finish but I wasn’t a big fan and a lighter color matched my desk better. After drying in the sun, I moved to assemble the cabinets. I mounted the midwoofer to the baffle with four screws, but the tweeter I was able to simply push right in. A bit of wood glue on the edges and some clamps and these things were ready to go. 

I hooked these up and have been running some test tracks and they sound great! These Hi-Vi drivers really pack a punch and the whole frequency range is well represented. Granted, these speakers roll off well before 20Hz but that’s to be expected from drivers and cabinets of this size. I haven’t actually glued in the top slab so I can open up the cabinet and make adjustments as needed. I’m still not exactly sure at what length the port tube is designed to be or how the dampening material is affecting my sound. I plan on tweeking a bit more to see how I like it.

I’d highly recommend this build, especially to fellow beginners who don’t want to do too much woodworking. At $125-150 I think this kit has a TON of value and I really love the sound. The DIY bug is already biting again and I plan on building a 2-channel amp for these babies soon. If anyone has any good builds or designs to look into, please let me know.

With a few, the signal sounds strong when holding more than one note at a time, but falls back to the unstable ""crackle"" once the signal returns to monophony. On some patches, the signal is completely inaudible. And for some reason, on a specific bass patch, the signal is perfect all the way through.

Also, the distortion pot appears to be doing nothing, even though it's wired correctly.

I've checked virtually everything, I've made sure the pots are wired with a strong connection, same with the jacks, switches, everything really.

I was wondering if it's possible to repurpose components from their crossovers to make a passive line level crossover.  

The speakers are currently bi-wired. Since the terminology is often misused, I'll be more specific. The rear surround channels from my receiver have been reassigned so that they duplicate the front left and right channels.  Each of these channels is being sent to a separate channel of the amplifier (an emotiva UPA-700).  The amplified signal is then filtered by passive crossovers (one channel feeding the mids and tweeters, and the other low passed for the woofers).  

What I'd like to do is use the components from my current crossovers and high/low pass the line level signal before it reaches the amplifier. 

However, since impedance affects the crossover frequency, would the same caps and coils work, or would it end up crossing at a different frequency?  Is the impedance level seen by the crossover different now that there's an amplifier between it and the speakers? 

I realize that the acoustic advantages of going this route are probably rather inconsequential, but reusing components I already own will be cheaper than purchasing an active crossover.

* 14.4V power supply by either Lipo's, Lions, NiMH, or SLA's (leaning towards 12x1.2V NiMH D cells
* I'm going to bi-amp each channel and have a woofer and tweeter for each channel
* Use [this](http://sound.westhost.com/project09.htm) for a line level xover
* Use a TDA7388A for an amp (4x42W @ 4ohm)
* Use car speakers

Now my questions are as follows:

1. The amp: It's expecting the input to be like ~-310 to 310mV (620 peak to peak), right? Not something weird like 0 to 620mv?

2. For the active xover, what am I looking for in an op amp. The guide I linked to doesn't say which to use. Will any work? Are there any great advantages to using one over the other?

3. Where do I find decent speakers for this relatively cheap? (I don't want to bust the bank on this)

4. 4x42W = 168W. How loud is this thing gunna get?

5. The sound.westhost.com site mentions using low tolerance (1%) resistors and caps (don't remember the tolerance for the caps). Is this really necessary?

6. Will a passive xover for the high channel of the biamping part for a mid/tweeter improve quality much? Would 
I run into phase issues?

6. Anything else I should be aware of?

I've taken everything out of it's case and re-mounted it in my a custom wooden case, with a brushed aluminum faceplate.  I'm running RCA cables &amp; speaker wire between all the audio components inside, aside from the splicing required to hook up to the rotary input/output switches.

It's all working really nicely together, except for some kind of grounding buzz, or otherwise interference, when the volume is up more than a few notches.  I know it's impossible for you guys to help me troubleshoot that without more info/specs/pics, but I do have just a couple of general questions regarding grounding &amp; audio components:

**01)**  Can/should all audio input/output lines share a grounding source, or is there interference when two audio signals cross grounds?  In this context i'm referring to a ""signal"" as a 3-wire audio line consisting of L, R, and GND.

**02)** Can/should all of the components in my case be grounded to a single point?  Since I took all components out of their original metal cases, and many of the components were using a chassis ground, what's the proper way to re-ground them now that their previous chassis no longer exists?

**03)** The buzz seems to be significantly reduced when I touch one of the speaker wire positives to the aluminum face-plate.  This makes me fear there's some kind of signal contamination happening on the face-plate. Or is that just effectively acting as a ground?  Would any extra load be generated from that? I don't want to over-power my amp.

I know this is pretty vague.  I'm kind of just in trial and error mode so thought i'd run the gist of it by you guys.    Thanks.

I'm 14 and I want to embark on my first real electronics project- common around these parts, but I want to build a boombox. However, I want to actually put time, money, and thought into this one. I've built suitcase boomboxes that were utter shit, and I want to avoid the scavenged from goodwill approach here. This will also be constructed out of a possibly veneered 3/4"" MDF enclosure. I'll probably throw a nice leather strap on the top too, making a perfect portable Hi-Fi setup... Ahhhh. Anyway, I'm planning on using the drivers, crossover, port, and terminals from the AV123 Xls-Encore, available for $149 a pair [here](http://www.audiocircle.com/index.php?topic=90911.0). I'll also probably use a 7Ah or so 12V SLA battery for power. On to my questions..
1. **What's the easiest way to charge the battery without cracking open my enclosure?** I want to keep the project as clean and polished as possible, so using a normal 12v charger to manually clamp onto the terminals simply isn't an option. Also, is there a way to manually transform a normal 12V power supply into something that could charge a battery without having to manually monitor the voltage of the battery so I don't fry it? I'd love to be able to plug a charger into a barrel connector on the enclosure and walk away without the threat of a house fire.

**2. What's the easiest (cheapest) way to add multiple (four) 1A 5V usb chargers on to my circuit (and maybe one 2.1A) without cracking open lighter socket chargers?** I'm sure I could just buy a couple, but that would strip the fun out of it. One 5V output would be possibly occupied by a bluetooth audio trinket- also curious, how would I automatically switch from the bluetooth adapter's audio output to the amp board to the input from another source, like a 1/8"" socket mounted on the front of the enclosure? 

**3. Are there any pre-built 2x25W Class-D or Tripath amps that would run well of of a 12v SLA battery?** I don't have the capacity to either design or build one, so that's out of the question unless my electrical engineering chops change dramatically, very soon.. And all I've seen are 2x15W TA2024 boards. Ones rated higher generally recommend a higher voltage to take advantage of the higher output. My contraption will be heave enough already, with an SLA batter and 3/4"" MDF construction. As you can probably tell , this build sacrifices several things in the name of fidelity. I still want to maintain some sense of portability, though, so I'm not stuffing four car batteries wired in series for 48V.

**4. I don't know how to pick out my potentiometer.**I know that carbon-ceramic pots are best for HiFi audio, but I have no clue what resistance to look for. For input I'll be using a Lumia 900 and [this guy](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?partnumber=320-353). Then I might splurge bit on my knob, and get something heavy buy sexy, as I feel that details like knobs add a lot to the overall perception of quality in a piece. I might me looking at selling this construct once I build it at a profit to fund the building of more (this sort of thing is immense fun to me!) and maybe a pair of headphones.. (last two got stolen, bad high school). So usability for someone other than myself is also a concern. Also part of the reason I'm thinking about something like (this)[http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12v-LED-battery-status-monitor-level-meter-indicator-A-/200547996513?pt=UK_Sound_Vision_Other&amp;hash=item2eb1979361] as opposed to (this)[http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/LED-Digital-Gauge-Auto-Car-Truck-Volt-Voltage-Meter-Voltmeter-Panel-DC-4-5-30V-/350642457275?_trksid=p2047675.m1850&amp;_trkparms=aid%3D222002%26algo%3DSIC.FIT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D11%26meid%3D6829650063121035434%26pid%3D100011%26prg%3D1005%26rk%3D3%26sd%3D400411882739%26]. The voltage might mean something to me as far as battery status goes, but it really wouldn't for someone else. The only concern that I have is that it both expensive and it seems difficult to attractively mount in a wooden enclosure. For that reason I'm still unsure of which to choose... though the cheap one also uses up to 60mA of power... decisions, decisions.

That's all I can think of for now. I feel like I'm missing something, though, so I apologize in advance for torturing your collective brilliance with something like ""**URGENT EDIT 37!!!**

Heres what I had in mind.  I would like to build a single audio component for my bed room.  I am wanting to put it on my night table and am thinking of something about 5-6"" tall, 8ish"" deep and 12-16' long. The Samsung DA-E750 is aesthetically similar to what I am aiming for. My budget would like to be around $250 - $300 for the audio stuffs.

I have spent the last four hours going through posts and what not and reading about the aviatrix kits and all of the other popular kits.  But I haven't seen anything other than bookshelf and tower kits.  I don't need audiophile quality but I do need moderate quality.  By this I mean that I am not interested in learning all about crossover construction and ohms and hertz and cubic feet of air space just yet but want something better than average store bought shight.  I have above average fab skills and a full shop at my disposal ( I am a custom furniture and cabinet maker working in the marine industry ) as well as access to a large array of materials.  I can learn basic soldering but want to keep it pretty simple.  More plug and play components than anything. 

Here's where you come in. This is not for super loud playback.  I listen to all kinds of music. So any recommendations on speakers, pre wired cross overs and an amp with a 3.5 mm jack and or RCA outputs so I can plug in my Iphone.  It doesn't need to charge my phone but if it did without getting too complicated then sweet.  I suppose I could purchase a simple charging station and incorporate it into the build.

When no source is connected to the amplifiers, there is no discernible noise through the speakers (maybe a tiny bit on the tweeters, if your ear is just about touching them, but not enough for concern). However, when connected (by RCA interconnects) to the B&amp;K, there is a low-frequency hum that is audible from a few feet away. For this reason, I suspect it is a ground loop issue that I didn't address while building them rather than some kind of interference generated within the chassis.

Furthermore, when sourced by my laptop fed through a USB-powered DAC (i.e. no secondary grounding aside from the amplifier's own), there is no perceptible hum - there is just a bit of high-frequency ""hiss"" that could probably be attributed to the quality of the NuForce uDAC feeding into a high-gain amplifier directly. 

What I'm asking is, is there any simple way to eliminate or reduce this humming? I can't even really think of where to start, aside from putting a resistor in series with the ground path inside the amplifier to cut down on the ground loop current. I just bought a Yaqin CD3 tube buffer today which has an output impedance lower than that of the B&amp;K, so maybe that will help as well.

If anybody could help, it'd be much appreciated. I very much enjoy the amps, I'd just like to eliminate the hum.

Over Christmas, my dad and I cracked open my Pioneer SX-838 to try to repair a vexing problem.  Here are the symptoms:

On the phono channels ONLY there is a persistent low 'roaring' noise accompanied by intermittent clicks / pops.  These can either be frequent or rare enough that I could get through an entire side of an LP without hearing one.  [Here's a recording](https://soundcloud.com/peter-tiso/sx-838-roaring-popping) - note that the actual sound is much lower than this suggests, but hopefully this'll help you get the idea.

The volume of this noise increases and decreases with the volume control, and the profile of it changes as you adjust bass/treble.  It is entirely absent even at max volume on aux/mic/radio modes.  

Since it was exclusive to the phono channels, my hypothesis was the preamplifier circuit.  However, all of the capacitors on both the preamp and power protection circuits tested fine in and out of circuit; the one that was testing about 25% off I replaced, no change to the noise.  I also checked the smaller transistors, but haven't gotten into the amplification transistors (possibly using wrong term here; the heat-sinked ones) so that might be a next step.

My question is this: where do we look next?  Should I consider doing a top-to-bottom recapping? This is my first time really ripping into a device like this so any advice is appreciated.

**Update 1-6-2013**

I've managed to completely resolve the issue and, as I type, Wild Nothing is playing clearly through the PL-15D-II that was purchased originally with the receiver around 1975. Here's what I did:

-Tested through the power amp board, preamp control board, and protection circuits without finding any major issues.  Replaced one smaller cap that was a bit out of tolerance.  Cleaned boards and checked connections in general; re-soldered one varistor with a broken lead (that I think I caused in my original tinkering) on the heat sink.  

-Took enough stuff apart to really get at the switches and volume controls from the back.  Very thorough application of contact cleaner.  This resolved the roaring and popping!  

-Grounding hum wasn't my complaint when I first started out, but this being my first phono setup I didn't realize how important it was either.  When I reconnected everything, I made sure to have a well-connected ground hooked up into the wall.  Definite improvement with that corrected.  

**Extra note:** I downloaded the SX-838 service manual off PDFs and noted a few very fundamental labeling errors on the PDF (such as the arrows labeling different component boards pointing to the wrong boards.)

  This is a crosspost from /r/AskElectronics.  I'm hoping that there might be some people here who can give me some insight into speaker enclosure design. 

  I would like to build a little powered speaker for utility purposes -- listening to signals on the bench for example.  I [came across something like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/13bbl8/my_first_project_for_school_speaker_using_the/) on reddit last month and decided that I'd like to have one too.

  I've got a computer speaker from an old Mac G5 Cheese Grater.  Just for fun, I'd like to design the best enclosure that I can for it... As an exercise... I understand that it will never sound ""good"".  

  I know nothing about the speaker, but I was able to take a few measurements with an LCR meter:

    Inductance at 1KHz:   185 µH
    Phase Angle at 1KHz:  8.5 degrees
    Impendance at 1KHz:    7.5 Ohms
    DC Resistance:         7.3 Ohms
  
    Labeled: SK
             YDT47K-1B-3
             4AT
  
  blurry pictures here (sorry, my phone camera sucks):

  [mac_speaker_1.jpg](http://electrocoder.com/small_speaker/mac_speaker_1.jpg)

  [mac_speaker_2.jpg](http://electrocoder.com/small_speaker/mac_speaker_2.jpg)
  
  It came out of a sealed enclosure, 70mm x 40mm x 35mm, nominally 98,000 mm^2, but only 96,674 mm^2 once you account for the internal mounting posts.  My gut feeling says that the dimensions were chosen for convenience, not performance.  The enclosure was also not very well ""sealed"".

  Can you guys give me any suggestions about what sort of enclosure to build? Sealed vs. ported? Packed full of fiberglass insulation or not?

  If you can suggest a specific, substantially better, small speaker that I can buy, then I am all ears...

Considering that more internal volume results in better response, can anyone offer some solutions to maintain the bass response? Maybe even reducing that tinny section?

The most appealing material to me is metal. I have extensive experience working with steel and have access to a MIG welder. I have no doubt that I could build a very solid stand very cheaply. The weight of a steel construction also seems like it would be a good thing; however, it would not be what I would characterize as low resonance.

I have also considered carbon fiber/fiberglass. I have done some work with composites in the past and believe I could build a solid stand in this manner as well. It would be far more time consuming and difficult though.

Wood is always an option too, but I really dislike working with it as a material.

* A portable speaker/subwoofer system with the following priorities in order from highest to lowest: Size/Weight &gt; Price &gt; Bass Extention &gt; Fidelity (still important!).
* Size: Exterior should be 2'4x11""x12"" +/- 2"" with all components included.
* Price: Flexible ballpark of $200
* Bass: enough to get a good sized living room bumping
* Fidelity: Going for the audio quality of the stock stereo in my 2011 Mazda 3.  In other words fun, non-fatiguing, sound for non-critical purposes like parties.



Components so far:

* L/R: [Polk Audio DB651 6.5-Inch Coaxial Speakers](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-6-5-Inch-Coaxial-Speakers/dp/B000P0PF9G)
* Sub: [Dayton Audio SD215A-88 8"" DVC Subwoofer](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/pshowdetl.cfm?&amp;Partnumber=295-484&amp;scqty=1)
* Amp: [4x100W @ 4 Ohm TK2050 Class-T](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/pshowdetl.cfm?&amp;Partnumber=320-335&amp;scqty=1)

I'm new to this and would really appreciate any advice.  Can anyone point me towards a guide for constructing your own housing for speakers?  Ideally I'm looking to buy or build something clean, simple and reliable without breaking the bank.  Should I still use the crossovers too?  The treble could get pretty harsh and the crossovers let you adjust them by 0db, -2db, or -4db.

The question I have relates to powering on the amplifier. It has push buttons that connect/disconnect the two speaker outputs individually. If I turn the amplifier on while the speakers are 'connected', they make a fairly loud popping sound, and the drivers are visibly pulled in. Over the period of a couple seconds, the drivers return to the resting position. A similar sort of thing happens if I power down the amplifier while the speakers are connected.

I have been worried that this could damage the speakers if done repeatedly, so I normally just push the speaker button to disconnect them when turning the amp on and off.

The only thing I can think of is that this is the result of charging the main capacitors. Whether this is the case or not, is there a way of reducing/curing this symptom?

I'm trying to build a simple LPF pedal, with just cutoff and resonance and an on/off switch. It's going to be used to filter quite a bit of noise, so the only constraint is that I need it to be able to withstand decent volume levels without degrading. 

After a lot of research, I'm a little bit stuck at what circuit to use.

The best thing I could find was this circuit by Ray/MFOS but I'm not sure that it is a low-pass filter:
http://fluxmonkey.com/electronoize/opampFilter.htm

A lot of people recommend [Eric Archer's LPF](http://ericarcher.net/devices/diy-lpf/) but right before I was about to purchase all the parts, I noticed the following:
&gt;""It distorts easily because there is approximately 1/3 the headroom with 9V single supply.  This circuit handles up to 5V peak-peak analog input.  That should be sufficient headroom to process audio from other devices running on 9V power, such as any of the Andromeda Space Rockers instruments.""

So I'm stuck, can anyone recommend what circuit to use? 
Thanks!

Long story short, I've rebuilt two 1980s era Pioneer home theater speaker tower units. I use them for my internet radio studio in my basement. I replaced all the speakers as the rubber surrounds were rotting away entirely. I've replaced the tweeters with 2 way pioneer 8 ohm 3.5 inch units. I've replaced the midrange with 3 way midrange 6 inch units. And I've replaced the 12 inch woofers with 600 watt max punch 2 subs.

The speakers had a main crossover. The keyword is had. Now the fun part, should I replace the main crossover to properly split the frequencies? Or should I just add a couple of bass blockers to the tweeters/midrange and rig up a low pass filter for the sub? I'm not quite sure how a back-to-back crossover will work, if it will work properly.
I'm also going to rebuild the cabinets entirely with probably 3/8ths or 1/2 inch MDF, so I'm considering builting 'mini cabs' inside the main for each of the tweeters/mids to prevent excessive excursion of the high/mid from the sub rumble.

I have photos of the cabinets if you want them, but they're ugly, and have been through a few too many car rides doing duty as 'OH SHIT TOO MANY MOBILE DJ GIGS AT ONCE'.

1369094610.0,5,self.diyaudio,1eqacy,Hi! Looking to decide on my first project.,kcolrehs,5,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/1eqacy/hi_looking_to_decide_on_my_first_project/,"I'm looking to build my first pair of speakers, and I have a budget of ~$200. From the last few days of research, the two top speaker choices which seem to stick out the most are the Tritrix and OverNight Sensation speaker kits. I have a few questions which I haven't been able to find solid answers too. Any help would be appreciated.

Just some background first:

I have all the required skills (wood working, soldering, etc.) required to put together a speaker cabinet from scratch. I also have all the supplies minus a circle cutting jig (A friend might have one, but atm its a considered expense). Because of cost, I will have to build the Tritrix cabinet from scratch. But I would rather put together a CNC cut-out because I know the end quality will be better.

In terms of usage, the speakers will be mainly used in a 14x16 room. I already have a subwoofer which I plan to use with the kit, a Sony SA-WMSP68. Technically, I don't have an amplifier, but I may be given an old Onkyo A-8190. Otherwise, I'll be looking to spend $50-75 on one, on top of the $200.

Questions:

1. A pair of OS MTM's  will cost $64 more than its non-MTM counterpart. Is this additional cost justified?

2. If I go with OS MTM or standard, what kind of dampening material should I use? Will Acousta-stuf polyfill be okay? If so, would a 1 lb bag be adequate for either design?

3. How does the sound quality of the Tritrix compare with the two different OS designs? If the Tritrix is significantly better, is it worth the risk of building the cabinet from scratch?

4. Are there other DIY kits which I have missed and should consider?

5. Any recommendations for an amplifier in $50-75 price range?


I apologize if I forgot to include any necessary information, or if I'm not asking the right questions. I'm new to dealing with speakers in general let alone building one.

From what I can tell there are definitely some crossover problems, but I can solder and probably figure that issue out. My main issue involves the tweeters, mid-range drivers, and woofers. 

Here's a list of issues:

* One tweeter is crushed, so I'm assuming it's blown and the other may be too.

* The drivers look okay, but one of the dust caps have definitely been replaced and the dust cap is inverted.

* One woofer needs to be refoamed (reconed).
* The woofer cones don't match. One has a curve while the other is more conical.

If I were to replace all of the parts with actual vintage 4411 parts from ebay, I'm looking at about $650 dollars worth of parts outside of my crossover work. 

I'd really like to get these back to sounding as good or better than they did in when they were released. I'd also like to use them as a studio monitor in the future. 

I'd appreciate input on replacement components or if this is even a worthwhile project to dive into. Thank you so much!

They seem to be speakers from a large boombox-type system.  I just got a little into car audio so I'm not too well versed and these speakers are confusing the heck out of me.


I took a couple of pictures [Here](http://imgur.com/a/tcWW0#0)


They an RCA plug for the 3 ""surround"" speakers.  That circuit is rated at:

-20W - Music Power

-16 ohm - Impedance 


The ""Main speaker"" has bare wires and is rated at:

-200W - Music Power

-6 ohm - Impedance



Looking up car audio, I'm used to 2, 4, and 8 ohms.  I also understand basic electricity and audio circuits enough to kinda get that fewer ohms in the circuit = more watts coming out of the speaker.  Although the amp will have a limit/range for acceptable ohms.  Also by doing series wiring or parallel wiring, you can play with the total Impedance some.


I am not sure what to look for in an amp.  I also see that the Watts are rated at ""Music Power"" and that I can estimate the RMS to be somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of that figure.

Anyways, please help me find an amp to use these speakers!  Thanks!





**UPDATE**
The speakers have four drivers each.  Two small ""Surrounds"", one tweeter, and one larger woofer.  I assume, there is a crossover between the ""surrounds"" and tweeter.  My question is if all the speakers are on one circuit or they are split as illustrated by my [awesome paint skills.](http://imgur.com/a/tcWW0#4)

I feel like the inputs could easily be just two different inputs for the same circuit of all the speakers with different connections for convenience.

However, the two separate circuit labels on the back side lead me to think they are separate (like at the blue line).

If they are split, I would like to make a simple crossover to get lows to the ""Main"" and mids and highs to the ""Surrounds.""  Sure they are crappy speakers but that seems perfect for doing some beginning tinkering.

In any case, I think the first question is what is going on for wiring and circuitry inside the box?  I'm not sure how to get in there and I think it will probably destroy it if I do so...

Because of the prospective cost of the project, I figured I would ask some more experienced audio DIYers about their opinions for what I've planned...

Ive picked the [10'' SEAS L26ROY](http://www.solen.ca/pdf/seas/l26roy.pdf) as my driver and the [Dayton SA-240-B](www.solen.ca/pub/cms_nf_catalogue_fiche.php?id=2475&amp;recherche=&amp;numRows=&amp;manufacturiers=&amp;niveau1=1&amp;niveau2=2&amp;niveau3=41) as the amplifier. The SEAS driver is rated for 300W with a 4 ohm impedance ( other specs in link ) and the Dayton amp is 240W when matched to 4 ohms. I've done some maths to and have chosen to use a 36.5 L box size with two 2"" ports each 36 cm long. According to the maths, this should yield a maximum port velocity of mach 0.08 for the driver/amp combination. The box has an expected tuning of 28.8 Hz.

Does anyone have any experience with this driver or amp? Should this amp be powerful enough to run the driver? I'm also curious as to if that port velocity could cause any whistling?

My main concern is that I feel like I've come up with reasonable calculations for box construction but I have no experience yet with actual design of subwoofer boxes.  Any opinions / criticisms are welcome!

I have a few questions that I need help with, and would be very thankful for the community's help :          

1) Am I going to blow everything up ? :/ I don't think so but I am still afraid of hurting one end or the other in the circuit.                  
2) I had in mind using a regular jack (as in the back of the speaker), cutting off the other end and using the 2 wires to connect to the receiver, but didn't think about the ground, which has nowhere to go if I do this.          
3) I'm using stereo jacks, and since each speaker only receives one signal, I think I need to connect both cables on the same pin, to ""transform"" it into a mono jack. would that do the trick ? if so, which one, right or left ?)            
4) I don't know much about the speakers themselves, I knew they were really old when I saw the jack connection, and by a quick search I see they're from the 60 or 70, and that had me wondering, will that cause any problem connecting it to a relatively recent amp ? (different technology of speakers, connection is not actually a jack ? ..)          
5) (bonus question) Has anyone got an idea of how they sound ? I can't wait to connect them to hear them, they feel like great quality speakers, but was what was done in the 60'/70' crappy in terms of quality ? or just a different tone ?

I recently installed a JVC KD-HDR60 and 4x Pioneer TS-A6874R in my 2002 Ford Windstar using Metra 70-1771 and 4x Metra 72-5600. This was my first car audio project so I made sure to check everything multiple times.

Three hours later I turn on the car and everything works. . . or so I believe. I quickly notice that the volume seems a bit low. I then move the fader to the rear speakers only and realize there is an extremely low level of volume coming from the speakers that I can only hear if I crank the head unit volume to max. Through further troubleshooting, I also find out that if I get even the faintest of sound from my rear speakers and I open the drivers side door, the sound to the rears (not fronts) cuts out.

I've done the following to try to troubleshoot:

1 - Move fader to rear speakers only. Volume is insanely low unless I crank the headunit to the max, then the volume does come through but at a really low level. Again rear speakers cut out if I open the door.

2 - Put in the old factory speakers in the rear. Issues above persist.

3 - Swap the front and rear speaker connectors on my head unit. Again front speakers play just fine, but not the rears.

4 - Ripped the door panels apart to ensure the speakers are connected properly and I haven't mixed the neg/pos lines.

5 - Checked the wiring harness multiple times. All connections are proper. 

At this point I'm lost as to what I need to do and need any help I can get. The almighty Google has thus far failed me as it did state this was common for people with a factory amp, however I do not have one on an 02 windstar as far as I'm aware. Any help would be much appreciated.

EDIT: So I fixed the issue. A bit of a long story but here it goes.

First off the speakers cutting out when I open the sliding doors was related to the way the speaker system is designed. I found out by opening the panels that the wiring from the speakers/locks go to a four metal pins (two for the speaker and two for the lock) and those pins make contact with a metal plate on the inside of the vehicle that then connect to a series of wires that leads back to the stereo. Awesome huh?

So as for the speaker cutting out. Well I basically just took my multimeter to the back of the stereo and registered 8 ohms evenly on every speaker except the back left which gave a strange reading. I knew that was where the short was, but I kinda put it on the back burner. 

I then had to replace my window regulator/motor because apparently the previous owner decided that instead of paying for a motorcraft motor, they would just pay for a cheapo dorman motor/regulator assembly. As I'm doing that I have to uninstall one of the regulator brackets and I unintentionally place it back on over the wires leading to the locks and door ajar sensor. This caused the wires to the lock and sensor to pancake causing very sporadic lock behavior and the door ajar sensor to stay on permanently. Anyway, I undid my mistake once I realized what I had done and just cut/stripped/crimped new wire in place of the flattened wire when I noticed a black/white wire (the color of the speaker wire) that connected to the metal plate to the passenger side, separated for all but two strands of copper. I realized this was my short and cut/stripped/crimped some new wire and bam! Not only did I fix my newb mistake of pancaking the sensor/lock wires but I also fixed the speaker short and it has yet to fade for several days!!!",,False,,t5_2tizz,1338018422.0,,,True,t3_tav8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/tav8e/what_did_i_do_wrong_with_my_car_stereo/,

I pretty much followed [This](http://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy-tutorial) word for word, with one extra tweak (Diode OR Bridge with 24v Transformer, only one battery for space reasons and a prettier LED)

It seems to be working almost perfectly (First attempt, I'm stunned at myself) although I'm not sure if i'm having a noise problem or not.

Let me elaborate - there is a small amount of noise on relatively low impedance headphones when the source is silent and the volume is cranked up max. I used the default gain of 11 when building it, so it's amping considerably for 36ohm phones. With the source up max, it obviously takes very little rotation of the knob to get it to a comfortable listening volume. However, I don't have a large to small Headphone adapter to test my big cans with yet. 

I'm assuming though that even though I will be amping further on 300ohm cans, the hiss will be objectively quieter and still the same relative to the volume of the music. On 36ohm cans, at say 100% source and 10% cmoy volume, there is no hiss, and the music is at comfortable listening volumes. Am I right in assuming that on 300ohm cans at 100% source and say 60% cmoy volume that the hiss will be just as quiet relative to the music?

What really surprises me however is that it is absolutely silent if there has been no music playing since turning the amp on. If I pause music and remove the source jack, the hiss stays, so I'm assuming it has something to do with the OpAmp not initialising until it detects an input. Am I right with that? (Just an aside question, since I'm curious)

**TL;DR - Is a breathing level hiss in 36ohm phones with a gain of 11 and the volume maxed out normal for a CMoy?**

After some googling this appears to be the manifestation of a very common problem with this series of NAD amplifier; the contacts on the speaker relays are dirty or corroded. Because the relays are sealed I can't get any deoxit in there to clean the contacts properly so I'm left with replacing them completely.

From forums I have pretty much narrowed down which relay I need to use as a replacement but **here is my problem**: 

 The replacement relays will have a different coil resistance than the stock relays. There is a resistor in the relay circuit that I can change to account for the change in relay resistance but I'm not sure how to calculate the value of the new resistor. I know it should just come down to some Ohm's law stuff but I'm a civil engineer, not an electrical engineer, and it's been a long time since freshman physics. 

[Here is close up of the relay circuit](http://i.imgur.com/l7ZkL.jpg)

Relays RL401 &amp; RL402 are the ones being replaced. They are Taiko PX-2405. Coil Resistance of 500 ohms. [Here is the datasheet](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/96208.pdf)

[Here is the planned replacement.](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Omron-Electronics/G2R-2A-DC24/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtSzCF3XBhmWz1dWWR22LTv3UP9bVW%252b41U%3d) This has a coil resistance of 1100 ohms.

R413 is the resistor in question. It has a resistance of 470 ohms.

C417 is a .01 micro farad cap and D401 is a diode. I don't know much about these except that changing them was never discussed in any of the forums I've read. 

I hope someone out there can help me solve this problem and thank you to anyone who takes a second to think about it. 

Let me know if you need anymore info. I have the service manual for the amp, I just don't know the best way to upload the whole pdf.

Basically as it stands I don't use my car stereo all that much. I typically plug my phone into my car's aux jack and just listen to my music library or pull up youtube videos.

Now for the plans. I have a couple goals that I intend to tackle one by one.

1. Figure out a way to, non-invasively, integrate my tablet into my car's media system. This tablet is a powerhouse and has everything that I would be looking for in a replacement head unit for my car. The problem is that my car does not have room for a double din touch screen, nor do I want to spend $500 if its not necessary and have my car be a target for burglary.

2. Modify the car's stock dash to allow me to put the Nexus 7 inside the fascia while still giving a ""semi-stock"" feel to it.

3. Network connection will be a big thing as the Nexus does not support 3g or 4g connections. I'm torn between upgrading my iPhone's data plan to allow tethering or dropping the data plan and getting a Clear 3g hotspot with unlimited data for the same cost.

4. Hands free calling is something I would like to have in this car. Though I currently just use speakerphone and thats fine if it can be integrated I would like to do so.

So my questions are. 

What is the easiest way to replace the stock head unit to allow usage of my Nexus' headphone jack to be the audio source? I assume there is something I can use that would allow me to utilize the stock speakers etc without having to purchase an expensive amp setup.

How can I integrate hands free calling into this? perhaps routing the calls through google talk or another app that would let me use my tablet as a ""headset"".

I'm not afraid of a little custom hack n' slash modding of stock products to accomplish this either. Any help is greatly appreciated. This will be my first project dealing with car audio.

Edit: My car is a 2008 Hyundai elantra with an OEM stero system that does not have bluetooth stock. I provided a picture of what the radio area looks like for reference below.

Hello, I just recently got into high quality audio equipment. I got 2 receivers as hand-me-downs from my parents and both of them seem to be having some problems.

I have linked picture albums with the guts of the two receivers as suggested in the original post.

The first is a [Mitsubishi DA R11.](http://imgur.com/a/WacTC)I've had this one for a little longer but just recently noticed it is having problems. When I use this the right channel will either not play everything it could be (I can fix this temporarrily by either tapping my speaker's woofer or getting the volume loud enough), or it is not playing at all. So far that's everything wrong with this one.

The next is a [Sony STR 7055](http://imgur.com/a/7UBMh). I just got this one today. After wiring my speakers to it (which took forever because its the first time I had seen screw-speaker wire inputs) I noticed that my right channel was going in and out randomly with different volumes and everything. When I adjust the volume, either nothing will happen or it will jump WAY too far randomly. Besides all of this, the sound coming out of this is sounding horrible (heavy distortion).

Here is a link to the service/owners manuals.[Sony STR-7055](http://www.hifiengine.com/library/sony/str-7055.shtml), [Mitsubishi DA-R11](http://www.hifiengine.com/library/mitsubishi/da-r11.shtml)

* Can I replace the dome tweeter with a similar ohmage horn tweeter of higher power rating so that the speaker can handle distorted sound without blowing?

While the woofers are reproducing normal sounding music, the tweeters are just very high frequency ""stuff."" Not musical at all and to my mind, not as loud as the woofers either.

I have two basic questions: 

1. Will installing a higher sensitivity driver help to increase the tweeter output and therefore treble? I am nervous that this may muddle the sound though too in the lower tweeter Fqs.

2. What wattage should be fine for the driver? I have yet to test the original drivers impedance with a multi-meter but this is just a general question. Most of the drivers on Parts-express are only good to ~35watts RMS. Is this normal for tweeters? My speaker is rated to 150 Watts RMS if memory serves (but its been a while).

I have some Advent loudspeakers (I don't have the individual model # handy) that I'm considering fixing up a bit. I'm wondering if it's worthwhile, and what might be entailed. 

I refoamed the woofers maybe 7-8 years ago, so I think I should be OK on that front. What about the crossovers? Should I consider replacing/overhauling them? Any resources for this? 

I know that speaker design is an integral process and the drivers are designed to work with a given cabinet. Would it be possible or even worthwhile to upgrade the drivers/crossovers while using the existing cabinet? I'm half expecting the response to this to be just build DIY speakers, which I'd love to do someday. If that's the case, I'd rather just make these Advent speakers serviceable for the time being. 

edit: I'm doing this primarily for improved bass extension...been buying lots of James Blake, Burial, and Mt Kimbie vinyl recently. The Speakerlabs with their 5-6"" drivers don't quite get the job done.

I am pretty ignorant to the science behind the sound in a sub, but from what I have read it does not matter what the shape of the box is as long as it has the right volume. With that being said I was wondering if someone could look over the design we are thinking of and tell me if it is possible or if you have a few tweeks for the volume or design, especially with port size. It should be similar to a ported bass wedge.  The plan is to have the jl 10w3v3-4 centered with to recessions, one on each side, that will hold two amps, a mono and a 2 ch for the door speakers.  I have been told to build the box to a larger volume than jls recommended size.

 I will post the rough design(i made it in ms paint so bear with it) for the box below and here is the link for the specs on the jl sub that I am using: [sub](http://www.jlaudio.com/10w3v3-4-car-audio-w3v3-subwoofer-drivers-92151) [BoxDesign](http://i.imgur.com/1jco0.png)

The calculations that I had were:
* width:28
* height 1:14
* height 2: 8
* depth: 14
so using 3/4 inch mdf it would give a volume of 1.89395 cu ft. The two angles on the wedge would be 67.52 and 112.48 degrees.  The two recessions to hold the amps would be a total of .29505 cu ft.  The speaker displaces .049 cu ft.  The port that I think is the right size would be 1X12 and 22.3"" in length so would displace .27505 cu ft.
So 1.89395-.29505-.049-.27505= about 1.275 cu ft.  
Any feedback to whether this is possible and would give good SQ and power would be great along with tweaks to the design. Thanks a bunch.",,False,,t5_2tizz,False,,,True,t3_vmblf,http://www.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/vmblf/building_a_sub_box_for_my_car/,

I used to own these Sony SS-U231 and the Sony HST-231, and I need more bass.

And for mids, 4 of these in each box.

I need to replace them somehow. Its an old system and I have the manual, but it seems that regular old run of the mill speaker stuff wont work too well because of the way this was built.

The current design has the crossover board. The speaker post is just a phillips head screw that goes through the board and to the outside of the speaker. Everything is COVERED in some kind of weird brown glue. The binding post itself screws on to the screw that is now sticking out of the terminal plate. So if you can imagine it, its a Post | Plate | Crossover/board | screw head. The screw head goes through all of that and into the post.

The screw is 3mm thick including the thread. The thread is VERY thin, and adds only maybe 0.5-1mm tops. I cant really measure it. The closest thing I could find at home depot was a #4 screw, but the thread didnt fit at all.

The screw doesnt actually screw into anythign except the post itself, it just slides through everything and sandwiches the terminal plate and crossover board together between the screw head and the post.

The screw is about 16mm long, but only 2mm or so sticks out. This is the reason the post broke off in the first place, hardly anything to screw on to.

I figured if I can get a 3mm wide screw (including thread) and some washers for it, I could use one washer to do the sandwiching duty and the second washer to sandwich the speaker wire I have.

Home Depot only has zinc, brass, and stainless steel screws. Radioshack only has zinc. I didnt want to use zinc and have corrosion problems. I wasnt sure if brass would make a difference or not.

I would really prefer not to solder the cross over because of this brown glue crap everywhere.

Alternatively, I do have the wiring schematic for the crossover and its not like I couldnt build the whole crossover and salvage parts from the old, I would rather just keep everything how it is and get through this with minimal cost/effort.",,False,,t5_2tizz,False,,,True,t3_uvali,http://www.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/uvali/speaker_postscrewwasher_selection_help/,

After some quick google-fu I found out they were M-audio AV40s, going anywhere from about $100-175.  After some preliminary testing I realized there are some definite issues with the speakers (which I will detail soon), but since I have a decent amount of spare time I would like to try and fix them before I toss them out as a lost cause.

So, my problem is a loss of sound in the pair of speakers.  I'm quite sure it is not the inputs as testing several cables and inputs (the L/R TRS inputs, the aux-in input, and the L/R line-in input) yielded the same result: Speakers randomly cutting in and out with sound. Changing the volume and jiggling the wires also did not help much.  There also is static as the signal goes in and out.

The problem is that I'm not sure exactly what is the problem then, and I need help narrowing down the problem.  So far I can think of these things:

* replacing the fuse
* potentiometer or volume control malfunctioning.  I don't think it's this because sometimes I'll have some extended usage where changing the volume doesn't cause problems.
* contact cleaner/lubrication.  If I choose this option, is there a particular brand I could find for &lt;$20?
* Overheating.  I don't think this is the problem but I honestly don't know
* problems with the electrolytic capacitors
* something with amps.  I don't know anything about this option.

I have two questions:
1) Would all these problems cause signal loss between the input device and the speakers? If not, which ones would not cause these problems?
2) What order should I tackle the problem?

I'm not sure if this would be the proper subreddit but I am still wondering if you guys would have the knowledge here... are the microphones on iphones, and androids capable of picking up a signal at a lower frequency then what is being played on a broadcast?

In the broadcasting industry there is a signal encoded into all broadcasts using psychoacoustics, so it's usually masked by whatever audio the programming is playing. However there exist devices that pick up these signals for audience measurement, im curious as to whether smart phones today have microphones capable of picking up this signal?
