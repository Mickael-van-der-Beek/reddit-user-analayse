____________________
**Plate tectonics - the wilson cycle** 

Plate tectonics are one of the most important factors in how continents look. Now you all know the basic principle behind that but there is something a bit more complicated you probably have never heard of: its called **the wilson cycle**. Pictures here under CC-BY-SA by Hannes Grobe

The wilson cycle describes a **recurring series of tectonic events**.

1. You start with an old continent. Since it is so old, it is also pretty flat, because if got eroded so much.
2. [Embryonic stage.](http://i.imgur.com/GYY3PBs.png) From the lower parts of the earth, a plume of hot material begins to rise. It then 'bumps' into the underbelly or your old continent. This means your poor old continent starts to get a couple wrinkles and rises up. It also **breaks** in this stage of the cycle you very often get **rivers flowing through the rift**. The Rhine is an example of this. You also get **volcanoes** directly on top of the plume.
3. [Juvenile stage.](http://i.imgur.com/B6SMvuI.png) The continent breaks apart. The middle part fills up with heavy material from all the volcanoes and sinks down. Its then filled with water. **This is the beginning of a new ocean.** You see it happening in the red sea. Just like the red sea you still have **a lot of vulcanism all around**. The placement of the volcanoes is not random. [It looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/m3bj2pL.png) In the middle of the three lines, underneath the crust is your plume of hot material. The two lines that follow the sea also have **tons of volcanoes, but under the sea**. Those are called mid-ocean ridges. **Mid ocean ridges are higher than the highest mountains**
4. [Mature stage.](http://i.imgur.com/uwRaQZD.png) The mid ocean ridge continues to produce a ton of material. The land on both ends is pushed outwards, like the atlantic. Not much happens, but you get an big ocean.
5. [Declining stage.](http://i.imgur.com/AMsPgKh.png) The land to both sides is no longer pushed outwards. Actually its pushed inwards, because you have stage 3 and 4 on other places on the globe, but stronger. The connection between the oceanic crust (grey) and the terran crust (orange) breaks. Oceanic then starts to get overrun by the terrestrial crust, you get what is called an **subduction zone**. Everywhere where you have a subduction zone, like the pacific ring of fire, you get **tons of volcanism**. the volcanism here is **explosive**. This has geochemical reasons that arent that important. 
6. [Terminal stage.](http://i.imgur.com/yf74pex.png) The friction can  cause **mountains to rise**. Those mountains are made out of **seabed and volcanic material**, so mostly limestone and rhyolit, maybe granite, etc. The reason is that all the lime that has been deposited by your coral reefs is now getting pushed upwards.
7. [Surturing stage.](http://i.imgur.com/k6niQwX.png) **Think himalaja**. Two continents collide. Really big mountains form. When you look at the rocks in the picture, and go from left to right, you get:
- stuff that was once on the left continent
- eroded stuff from the first mountains that formed in stage 2-6
- volcanic rocks
- seabed materials, so limestone and basalt
- stuff that was once on the right continent

**So what the hell does this mean for worldbuilding**

- You will always get big geological systems. that means that mountains and other geological features over large areas will have the same directions. [Look at this map of germany](http://i.imgur.com/bf8C0sY.jpg). Red stuff is salt, all the other lines mark directions of geological features. Note that you only have 3 or 4 major directins. That because they were are all formed by the same handful of events.
- Mountains, oceans, different kinds of terrain are **not randomly placed**. The alps are there because africa is currently colliding with europe, and they are right at the lower edge of europe, close to the meditarrean.
- Volcanoes are not randomly placed, either. You get them at subduction zones or if you have some hot matieral coming up from underneath like on hawaii.

_______________________
**Erosion and transport**

Erosion is what makes small rocks from big rocks and mountains. There are many different forms of erosion and what exactly they are isnt really that important. What is important are different forms of transport. Lets start with 

**water**:

- Higher stuff erodes faster
- Stuff gets transported from high to low
- **Water makes stuff round**
- Big stuff is harder to transport than small stuff, that means **that rivers sort sediment**. In the beginning, when the river flows fast, you have a lot of big stuff lying around, but later, when the river flows more slowly, the maximum size of stuff it can transport gets smaller and smaller. So if you are close to mountains, you get a ton gravel and the like, but the farhter away from the mountains you get, the smaller the gravel gets, until at the end you have only sand, first coarse then fine.
- When rivers transport a lot of material you get stuff called [alluvial fans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan) close to mountains. This is where a lot of the coarse material is deposited. Deltas are similar, but are formed where the river flows into the sea. Both deposit **a metric shitton of material**. They span literally hundreds of kilometrers.

**Glaciers**

- Ice can transport everything. Even whole blocks of mountains. 
- **Glaciers dont sort** you find really big, 100 m blocks next to sand
- **Rivers change path** when next to glaciers, because they cant flow over the glacier
- When glaciers melt, the water will transport a lot of the fine material with it.
- Land that was eroded by glaciers recently shows **very steep inclines**. You dont normally get that. For example fjords look like they do because of glaciers.

**Wind**

- Wind can transport **fine sediment over long distances** in germany we have dust from africa.
- Depending on ground and wind speed, it can happen that **all the surface sand gets blown away** leaving you with a closed surface layer of gravel.
- **Wind tends to make stuff edged and matte**


**So what the hell does this mean for worldbuilding**
- The history of your world changes the way your world looks. 
- Different parts of your world will have different soil. 
- Rivers dont look the same everywhere
- **Everything is connected**. You will find sediments from the mountain spring where the river flows into the ocean.

______________________________

**Types of rock**

**Sedimentary**

sedimentary rocks are everything that was once a sediment. A sediment is every grain that is not part of the underlying rock anymore. So gravel, sand, boulders, dust, thats all sediment. I can think of four really important major types of sedimentary rocks

- Biological sediments: limestone. Limestone is largely deposited by algae in reefs and such. So its only deposited in **shallow water**. There are also rocks which are literally made up out of seashells. Its always grey, and it reacts to acid like vinegar.
- **Sandstone**: its made up out of.. well, sand. Either that sand was deposited in the desert or through water. If in a desert you **[can still see the dunes](http://i.imgur.com/y2Xt8vD.jpg)** in the old rocks. if deposited by water, you see something similar, but way smaller. Sandstone give you nice stratas that can be made up out of different sand-compositions. So one layer might be brittle, the next one not. That is caused by **periodic events like flooding**.
- Chemical sediments: thats stuff like salt. Basically Oceans evaporate and leave salt behind. Salt can be deformed so it actually changes its shape underground and slowly rises up.
- 'Fossilized gravel''. Its not actually called that way, but you can get what looks like fossile gravel. So big rocks and small rocks and sand all in one rock. Either thats glacial sediment formed into a rock or its formed in oceans or close to mountains.

**Volcanic**

Volcanic rocks are formed by volcanic activity. They can be either solid chunks like **basalt** or sediments like **ash**. Some volcanoes explode, some just kinda flow peacefully. If it flows its usually basalt. if it explodes its usually ash, tephra, rhyolite. The more terrestrial crust the magma has molten until it erupts, the more likely it is to explode. Hawaii is made up from magma that comes straigt from the mantle, so it just flows. 

Volcanic rocks cool down very fast so you get **some medium big crystals in very fine matrix**.

**Plutonic**

Plutonic rocks are made from magma, too, **but they form under ground**. That means they cool down very slowly, so you get **very big nice crystals**. For example **granite**.

**Metamorphic**

Either of the above, if put under lots of pressure or temperature, will undergo metamorphosis. Minerals will change, crystals will grow or get absorbed. You get things that look almost like layered sediments but its actually plutonic rocks put under pressure.



_______________________________-

**Basic climate geography**

If your planet rotates the same way earth does, the wind on the northern hemisphere comes **from the western direction**. That has something to do with the coriolis force. Its exactly opposite on the southern hemisphere. If your planet would only be ocean, you would get a wind system that looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/LXapgLI.jpg).

The most important part is probably that the wind comes from west, however it comes from east if you are close to the equator.

Temperature is obviously dependend on your latitude. That has something to do with **the angle between sun and surface**. The more of a right angle, the more energy / area. But climate zones **change based on mountains and oceanic currents**. New york should be way colder than it is, but because of the appalachian mountains the cold wind from the west is kind of redirected northwards. 

**Precipation** mainly depends on how close you are to the sea. the closer you are, the more precipation you have. Mountains also have a huge effect. A big mountain range next to the sea means that a lot of the water will rain down there, flow down the mountain into the rivers. Everything eastwards will have way less precipation.

EDIT: regarding the world map, I've never before used photoshop in my life, but I simply wanted to provide a visual representation of their planet (well, our planet). Next time, I'm going for realism point-for-point.

Oh, and do read the Sexual Dimorphism part. Especially that part.

EDIT: a few have noted a slight similarity between this world and the Discovery Channel mini-series The Future is Wild--I know. And though I've never seen it (it had already stopped showing) that's what it was very lightly based upon. I've written in one of my comments below a few differences between TFIW and Samitola.

""

* TFIW uses a different hypothetical supercontinent known as Novopangaea wherein all the continents fused. The hypothetical continent I used is Pangaea Ultima, which has an inland sea bordered by South America, Africa, India and Asia, and a smaller continent to the south formed by Australia colliding with Antarctica.

* Fish aren't aerial. I found the idea a little unrealistic, as fish are already perfectly adapted for water, which they continue to do so in Samitola. The aerial creatures in my world belong to the class osteomollusca, like my sapients, but belong to a different taxonomic family.

* I wasn't too sure about hopping snails. There had to be a different life form to develop my herbivores--and I realized they could be descended from mudskippers. They would be biologically different from the vertebrates we know now, as our tetrapod vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fish, and mudskippers descended from ray-finned fish. This made the new vertebrates part of the phylum pulmocrania (lung skull), which are bipedal, and their namesake refers to the cranial placement of their lungs instead of in their chest, a holdover from mudskipper gills. The ipachya pictured in the tab ""Pre-sapient Ecological Niche"" is an example. Besides them, vertebrates as we know them are extinct in this world.

* Their molluscs didn't have skeletal structures, which in reality would make it extremely difficult for them to live their whole lives on land. Mine use keratin for ""bones,"" instead of calcium carbonate in vertebrates. It gives them sufficient bodily structure, and though they couldn't reach sizes as large as vertebrates could (due to the fact that keratin is less sturdier than calcium carbonate bones), it is enough for them to live in the dry dessert environment.

Supercontinents tend to have global deserts, so it wasn't much of a surprise when I realized TFIW had one, too. In fact, so did old Pangaea, and had a [dead zone](http://www.bitsofscience.org/wordpress-3.0.1/wordpress/images/2012/10/triassic-dead-zone.jpg) around the equator which was too hot for life, separating organisms between the northern and southern hemispheres.

1373468987.0,81,self.worldbuilding,1i0eq6,Flagbuilding - A Guide To Flag Design for Worldbuilders,TheBishopsBane,87,6,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1i0eq6/flagbuilding_a_guide_to_flag_design_for/,"I see a lot of maps in this subreddit, which is awesome because I like maps, but an integral part of my world building has always been flags. I've seen some people struggle with their designs, so, for those who are interested, I present my **Guide To Flag Design for Worldbuilders**

&amp;nbsp;

### The Shape

Nowadays, all but [one country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Nepal) flies a square or rectangular shaped flag, but it wasn't always that way. For practical reasons, most flags will have a straight edge along their top or left side so they can be hung or flown from a pole, but the shape can be rectangular, triangular, swallowtailed, or anything else you like. Once you've settled on an outside shape, we can start designing the insides.

&amp;nbsp;

### Divisions Of The Field

Very often, your flag will consist of more than one background colour, and the separation of the two colours is called a ""division of the field"". The traditional divisions are:

* halving horizontally
* halving vertically
* halving diagonally
* halving by chevron (vertically separated by a ^ shape)
* parting into three in a Y shape
* quartering diagonally (like an X)
* quartering horizontally and vertically (like a cross)
* [full list with fancy names here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_field)

The separations do not have to be by straight line either. You can divide using waves, zigzags, or any number of repeating pattern. For a bigger list, check out wikipedia's article on [Lines of Division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_%28heraldry%29#Gallery_of_different_lines_of_partition)

Rather than simply dividing two colours, you may want to have a pattern of two or more colours, called a ""[variation of the field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_of_the_field)"". This includes stripes, checkers or any other repeating pattern of shapes.

&amp;nbsp;

###Colours

A basic rule-of-thumb when designing a flag is to keep the number of main colours to 2 or 3. This helps keep the colors bold and distinctive and keeps the design from looking too cluttery. Most countries attribute meaning to each of the colours in their flag, and while this is totally open to interpretation, there are some common themes:

* **Red:** war, blood, struggle, courage, revolution, valor. The most common color in all national flags.
* **White:** peace, purity, snow. The solid white flag represents surrender
* **Blue:** freedom, patriotism, sky, ocean. 
* **Yellow/Gold:** sun, wealth, prosperity, agriculture (wheat).
* **Green:** earth, peace, nature, fertility.
* **Black:** death, struggle, anarchy/piracy

The [Rule Of Tincture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_tincture) is an old Heraldic rule which essentially prevents colors of similar brightness appearing next to each other. It specifically applies to the colour of symbols and objects with respect to the field of a coat of arms, but it has become a good standard to go by. Basically, don't put two light colours or two dark colours beside each other (ex: white on yellow, or blue on black). If you really want to use similar colours, consider a [fimbriation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbriation) (a fancy word for stripe) dividing the two (a great example are the white stripes on the [flag of Kenya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Kenya))

&amp;nbsp;

###Charges

A charge on a flag or coat-of-arms is simply any emblem or device on the field. It might be a simple shape like a star or cross, or it may be an animal or object. A few common charges are:

* Crosses and Saltires (x shapes)
* Stars, Suns, and Crescent Moons
* Crowns and Sceptres
* Anchors, Boats, or Planes
* Lions, Eagles, any real or mythical beasts
* Swords, Axes, Bows, and other weapons

The number and position of your charge may be just as important as the charge itself: three crowns may indicate a union of three kingdoms, but one large crown above two smaller ones may mean dominance or conquest; stars are a very common device used to indicate sovereignty (when alone) or union of smaller groups (when together); and a symbol or device in the canton (top left quarter) may indicate a history or connection with another entity, like the British Union Jack in the canton of the Australian flag.

&amp;nbsp;

###Some basic DOs and DONTs

You should strive to make your flag unique, but there are a few no-nos in the world of flag making that would make most vexillologists (ie flag nerds) cringe.

* **DO NOT use any words or text**. Writing the name of the country defeats the purpose of using the flag as an identifying symbol. Dates and mottos are only slightly less bad, but all suffer from the problem of being backwards half the time when viewed from the other side. Plus, unless the letters are huge, you probably can't make out the words anyway.

* **DO NOT use seals or logos**. Seals are often highly complex and contain intricate details that are both difficult to manufacture and impossible to see. Save them for closing your letters in wax.

* **DO NOT use gradients or drop shadows**. Just don't. Obviously it's impractical to manufacture, but it also just looks plain bad. 

* **DO borrow from the best**. Study other flags. Figure out what you like about them and what you don't.

* **DO keep it simple**. A common saying is that a flag should be simple enough that a child could draw it from memory. While some charges can be a bit more complex, the idea is to keep the flag pretty basic. One, two, or three background colors with a large, single charge is more than enough to make a unique, distinctive, and great looking flag.

&amp;nbsp;

The above guidelines are based on Earth (mostly western) traditions. Your world is going to have its own history and traditions, and those conventions can (and should) be incorporated into your flag designs. Your world might have strange creatures, or an unusual object serving the same function as a crown on Earth - incorporate them into your flag(s). The process of planning out and designing your flags will hopefully serve to enrichen your world and its history.

Hi everyone! First post to worldbuilding. The Civ Worldbuilder has been posted a couple times before, but they weren't very in-depth posts.. just pictures. I'm here to give you guys a more in-depth look as to what you can do with it.

When you start up the Worldbuilder, it allows you to select a few parameters for your world including water level, climate, and world age (younger = more vertical terrain that hasn't been worn down). You can also choose what types of landmasses it should randomly generate. Some of these options include fractal, which creates thinner, snakier continents, and a ""continents"" option, which essentially creates landmasses like the ones I have in this post.

Examples of continents: [Map1] (http://i.imgur.com/LMVRdtB.jpg), [Map2] (http://i.imgur.com/CfPZMR5.jpg), [Map3 (which I'll be working with)] (http://i.imgur.com/bM2Lx7G.jpg)

After you generate your map, you are taken into an editor which allows you to paint hexagons certain types (desert, ocean, plains, etc.), add features (forest, hills, rivers, etc.), and add resources to the hexes (fish, copper, wheat, sheep, etc.). 

[Here's an example of my desert for a pseudo-egyptian civilization, with resources added in specific locations.] (http://i.imgur.com/9NlYmQd.jpg)

[And here's a close-up of the location for a polynesian seafaring culture.] (http://i.imgur.com/u9RZwOK.jpg)

You can also place roads and natural wonders like the ""fountain of youth"" in the depth of the forest like [here](http://i.imgur.com/OTtLaY6.jpg). I have also placed some city ruins and an ""El Dorado"" natural wonder deep in the jungle mountains down by my polynesian civ.

Next, you are able to create your civilizations based on the preset civilizations in Civ V. If you really want to specify everything, you can adjust the technologies that the civ knows and specify which is connected to which. [Example] (http://i.imgur.com/0Zh2JIM.jpg).

You can then place cities and determine which buildings their city has. [Example for my Seafaring civ.] (http://i.imgur.com/gD0zDLn.jpg) It also adds city names according to the civilization. 

---

[And here's a relatively finished product] (http://i.imgur.com/Iibpunu.jpg) of what my world turned out like. The black and green/white city names on each side of Dalstead/Achford are City-States that my main civilizations would interact with, but who aren't huge players on the world stage. I would also like to add another northern, possibly seafaring state in the large open area in the northwest of the main continent.

Another cool thing about the worldbuilder is the oil, coal, and uranium deposits are all resources that don't actually show up until later in a civ game, so in the case of a medieval fantasy story, it's something that isn't recognized for what it is and basically remains a hidden part of the world that makes it a bit deeper for the audience.

Questions and comments are appreciated. Thanks for your time everybody!

1361967239.0,78,self.worldbuilding,19bn1f,My attempt to merge worldbuilding with programming,Almanorek,88,10,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/19bn1f/my_attempt_to_merge_worldbuilding_with_programming/,"I've been a long fan of D&amp;D and RPGs in general, but I've never attempted to *really* build a world. There were the occasional towns and dungeons here and there, but I felt like I was just creating separate entities for the sake of content.

So, this time around, I wanted to make an actual world for my players to explore. The only problem is, I don't really have a lot of time. Rather than handcrafting each city and point of interest, I decided to take care of the legwork by designing a few simple 'algorithms' to try and 'grow' a world.

[This is the end result, but I'd really like to share how I got to it.](http://i.imgur.com/a8ZWGIM.jpg)

The first thing I did is make some continents using World Machine. I picked one that I thought looked nice and picked that as my 'starting ground'.

[The Map](http://i.imgur.com/mZoYKi2.jpg)

I then created a 16x16 grid overlay and used a few more perlin noise functions to generate four types of natural resources, then 'snapped' them to that grid:

[The Forests](http://i.imgur.com/xXgua7u.png)

[The Tech](http://i.imgur.com/ruTHDG1.jpg) (E.g., iron)

[The Econ](http://i.imgur.com/Gmrofz2.jpg) (E.g., gold, silver)

[The Magic](http://i.imgur.com/gHyeg0U.jpg) (E.g., 'leylines', mithril)

I used a vague heuristic to determine where to place starting settlements:

&gt;Early Humans prioritize forest edge

&gt;Early Elves prioritize deep forest

&gt;Early Dwarves prioritize mountain top

&gt;Others prioritize plains

Using these 'rules', I manually spackled the map with settlements, color-coding them by race.

[The Settlements](http://i.imgur.com/tflqz9R.jpg)

The settlements only cared about forests. My logic was that the earliest settlers wouldn't have ways of detecting natural resources, especially ores hidden under the ground, so they only cared about the most evident resource- trees, and the terrain.

After the settlements, I also placed 'danger' zones, everywhere in the landscape. Danger zones represented monsters, bandits, environmental hazards, and other places that people would generally not want to go to. Because of their generic nature, they could go literally anywhere, and to create enough problems for the adventurers to solve, I placed them very liberally. The bright red spaces are 'big dangers', generally considered lethal.

[As so.](http://i.imgur.com/hTr1VlQ.jpg)

Each settlement was given three scores, based on the resources near them. Each race was given rules, which determined how well they could utilize and harvest those resources, and how their score was affected by them.

&gt;Humans: +3 from each adjacent resource, +1 from each resource two spaces away.

&gt;Elves: +2 from each adjacent tech/econ, +3 from each magic up to three spaces away.

&gt;Dwarves: +2 from each tech/econ up to three spaces away, +1 from adjacent magic.

&gt;Half-Orcs: +2 from each adjacent tech/econ.

&gt;Gnomes/Halflings: +1 from each adjacent resource.

I wrote up a list for each settlement and what their three scores were. This added up to a total resource score.

I also gave each settlement a danger score.

&gt;For all: 3 for danger within two spaces, 10 for big danger within two spaces.

Then I picked capitals. Different races had different capitals based on what I felt were the valued settlement qualities of those races.

&gt;Humans: National Capital (Tech + Econ), Magus Capital (Magic)

&gt;Elves: Spiritual Capital (Magic)

&gt;Dwarves: Trade Capital (Econ)

&gt;Other: None

Then I assigned each settlement cultural policies, based on how I felt the settlement would develop given its available resources and present dangers, using a few if-then-else statements.

&gt;Humans: If score &gt; 5, Civilized, else Scavenger. If Civilized and danger &gt; 5, Militaristic, else Diplomatic. If Scavenger and danger &gt; 5, Tribal. If score &gt; 25, if no danger, Arrogant, else Sympathetic.

&gt;Elves: If score &gt; 10, Xenophobic. If not Xenophobic, if danger = 0, Sympathetic, else Timid. If score = 0 and danger &gt; 0, Tribal.

&gt;Dwarves: If danger &gt; 0, Secluded. If score &lt; 50, Curious, else Generous.

&gt;Half-Orcs: Tribal

&gt;Halflings/Gnomes: Curious, Timid

And then each settlement gets a culture score based on its combination of resources, danger, proximity to other settlements, and cultural policies.

&gt;+1 culture for each 5 of tech/econ/magic.

&gt;-2 culture for each 5 danger score.

&gt;+X culture for closest settlement. Starts at +5, decreasing by 1 for every two tiles. Minimum +1.

&gt;+2 culture for each other settlement within 5 tiles.

--

&gt;Civilized: Double resource and close settlement culture.

&gt;Scavenger: Halve closest and close settlement culture.

&gt;Militaristic: Halve danger penalty.

&gt;Diplomatic: Triple closest and close settlement culture.

&gt;Tribal: Double closest and close settlement culture of the same race.

&gt;Arrogant: No culture from settlements with half resource score or less.

&gt;Sympathetic: Triple closest and close settlement culture for settlements with danger.

&gt;Secluded: Halve close settlement culture, double closest settlement culture.

&gt;Curious: Double culture from settlements with more of any resource.

&gt;Generous: Double culture from settlements with less of any resource.

&gt;Timid: Halve culture from settlements with more tech.

&gt;Xenophobic: No culture score from different races.

--

&gt;Double culture for capitals.

&gt;Round down.

Now, I needed ways for members of a given settlement to get to other settlements. The solution is roads. I determined the number of roads a settlement would get based on its culture score:

&gt;Each settlement with positive culture gets 1 road.

&gt;Each 10 culture = 1 more road.

And then a heuristic for determining where roads would lead. I placed them manually, starting with the settlement with the highest culture and going in descending order.

&gt;Settlements build roads to the closest settlements.

&gt;Settlements don't consume roads building to settlements that have already built roads to them.

&gt;Roads will merge into other roads instead of crossing them.

To me, this made sense. Settlements wanted to build efficient road networks. The most cultural settlements (Meaning the most well off and surrounded by other settlements.) would have the most roads coming out of them, while the isolated, destitute settlements would have few roads at best.

Note: '1 road' meant the settlement would *initiate* a road. Roads already 'constructed' by higher-culture settlements won't 'use up' lower-culture settlements' roads.

[The Roadmap](http://i.imgur.com/foFV0vL.jpg)

And not every road would be the same, so a simple set of rules determined the state of various roads.

&gt;Roads that cross water get a dock at each endpoint. (Blue)

&gt;Roads connecting to Xenophobic settlements are downgraded to dirt. (Brown)

&gt;Roads connecting to settlements whose total culture is less than 10 are downgraded to dirt.

&gt;Interections with three or more connecting roads get a trading shanty at the intersection. (Gold)

&gt;Dwarven settlements connecting to Dwarven settlements go underground. (Gray)

&gt;Roads connecting to trading hubs can't be downgraded to dirt.

&gt;Roads connecting to capitals can't be downgraded to dirt unless one of those settlements is Xenophobic.

This led to the modified roadmap:

[This one.](http://i.imgur.com/NY1bqmy.jpg)

I'm going to be moving on to determining population percentages, social policies, legal policies, and generating the actual makeup of each settlement. I haven't actually *programmed* any of this, but once I 'beta test' it with my playgroup, I'll heavily consider it.

Considering this is my first attempt to worldbuild, I am 95% sure there are problems with it.

For me, my vote would have to go to [South East Asia.](http://i.imgur.com/DX4zANa.jpg). I mean, just look at that geography!

You have lots of interesting, elaborately ""created"" landmasses, a massive and exotic mix of cultures and languages, thousands of years of history, and fascinating civilisations and religions that have risen and fell on the thousands of archipelago that dot to seascape. Throughout the ages you've had the Han, the Hindus, the Muslims, the Japanese, the White Man and the local tribes all make their presence felt. The sheer genetic make-up diversity in these lands is mind-boggling, and to any alien simpleton coming and exploring this area, he would have to swear that this was only the result of some fascinating divine creator. Now, I know this can apply to all lands of earth, but imagine the disparity of stories you could tell from SE Asia alone; anything from a poor farmer dealing with the hardships of excessive rain, to a pirate searching for spiritual meaning in his life as he is constantly on the run from the powerful kingdom's navy, to the supreme ruler of an empire who's shoulders bare the fates of faiths and nations .

EDIT: Ok, this isn't an exhaustive list of programs, it's just some world building methods in inkscape and pdn. Sorry to disappoint.

# INKSCAPE
Inkscape is a free vector graphics program designed for web SVGs, but it's also a good cartography tool. Available from http://inkscape.org/.

## Freehand (free mouse?) drawing
While the inkscape pen tool supports curves, I wouldn't recommend trying to use that function to draw coastlines or contour lines for topo maps, I usually just use the [straight line mode][IMG 1], and click really fast while tracing the desired [coastline][IMG 2] (try not to click TOO fast, a perceived double click ends the path).

## Fractalize
The coastline I used in the above example looks too human, which is fine if that's what you need, but sometimes it's nice to add a random element. Go to [Extensions -&gt; Modify Path -&gt; Fractalize][IMG 3] then [this][IMG 4] and [voila][IMG 5]. This does, however, leave you with a very [node heavy line][IMG 6], so I like to [simplify][IMG 7] it [afterward][IMG 8]. If you still want the straight line look, you can subdivide ([one][IMG 9], [two][IMG 10] [three][IMG 11]) the nodes and straighten ([one][IMG 12], [two][IMG 13], [three][IMG 14]).

## Voronoi
If you need to split a region up into semi-random segments (tectonic plates, countries, etc), Inkscape's [voronoi extension][IMG 15] can come in useful. I like to crank up the size to something more [work-with-able][IMG 16]. The result: [this][IMG 17]. 

## Outset &amp; Inset
Outset and Inset are located under the Path menu [IMG 18]. I like to use them for a cartographic effect that I don't know the name of, but it looks like this: [1][IMG 19], [2] [IMG 20], [3] [IMG 21], [4] [IMG 22], [5] [IMG 23].

## Text on Path
Inkscape (and SVGs in general) have a handy text-on-path feature. To use this in inkscape, [select][IMG 24] the text and path (in any order), and select [Text -&gt; Put on Path][IMG 25]. The result: [this] [IMG 26]. If this happens, try [reversing][IMG 27] the path. [Much better][IMG 28]. Might want to [space it out][IMG 29] a bit though.

# PAINT DOT NET
Paint.NET is a (windows only, but I'm sure gimp would work for most of this) raster graphics editing program. Available from http://www.getpaint.net/. Make sure to get this http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/7291- plugin, several of the following features are part of it.

## Render Clouds
This is one of the backbones of map generating in PDN. It's located in [Effects -&gt; Render][PMG 1]. [This][PMG 2] is the result. To get a b/w map from this, go to Adjustments -&gt; Brightness and Contrast and set [Contrast to 100][PMG 3].

## Gradient Map
If you've downloaded the pyrochild plugin, gradient mapping is very useful for map making (located in Adjustments -&gt; Gradient Mapping). The effect takes a grayscale image (it'll be converted to grayscale internally if not already) and [maps it to another scale][PMG 4].

## Posterize ##
If I need to turn a smooth grayscale map (or anything else) into a ramped, stepped topography ready map, I usually use the Posterize effect (Adjustments -&gt; Posterize). [Example][PMG 5]. Let's jump back to inkscape for a second to make a topo map out of this. [1][PMG 6], [2][PMG 7], [3][PMG 8], [4][PMG 9]. That wasn't the best example, but you get the idea.

## Layers ##
So you've got some [layers][PMG 10] set up, how do they interact with each other. Press F4 or go to Layers -&gt; Layer Properties.

Blending Modes:

* [Normal][PMG 11]: This takes a weighted average of two layers.

* [Multiply][PMG 12]: This multiplies the pixels of the bottom layer by the brightness of the top layer, where white is 1 and black is 0.

* [Additive][PMG 13]: This adds the RGB of the layers. If the sum is greater than 255 it's truncated.

These are the most important to know, screen and darken just map greyscale to alpha and the rest you can figure out on your own.

To make a detailed heightmap I usually try to use many layers and mix them until the map no longer looks generically random.

## Distort
When working with layers and also in general you can mix things up with the Effects -&gt; Distort menu. I'm not going to into depth with words, but here's several thousands worth: [crystalize] [PMG 14], [dents] [PMG 15] (huge range of effects available by tweaking the settings), [frosted glass] [PMG 16]. Also, under Effects -&gt; Noise there's noise (pretty straight forward) and [Median][PMG 17] which is infinitely useful.

People love to draw coasts, and in particular they like jagged, fjord-filled coasts, dramatic bluffs, and squiggly coastlines in general.  And I don't have a problem with this...I mean, who _doesn't_ love a good fjord?  But sometimes it's good to have a different ""feel,"" or at least some variety.  

So I think you should consider including a type of coast I rarely see on maps....smooth, curving coasts with barrier islands.   You get these coasts where flatlands meet the sea.  They are visible all along the US East coast from New Jersey to Mexico.  The large scale outline gives a sort of ""scalloped"" look, like a bunch of shallow semicircles have been notched out of the coastline, forming a series of arcs.  Usually, there's a wide, sandy beach--often on a barrier island, blocking off a back bay filled with marshes and waterways.  Large bays are usually present where rivers enter the ocean, providing good harbors for cities.  It gives an entirely different coastal feel than seen on a rocky coast.

1352757481.0,67,self.worldbuilding,13332i,A Refutation of Elves,eremiticjude,84,17,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/13332i/a_refutation_of_elves/,"Forewarning: the following is a bit of a rant, on the subject of elves with specific regards to why it made perfect sense for Tolkien to have them and consequently why it makes so little sense for them to crop up in every freakin' single fantasy world since then. additionally, since i'm doing this on my lunch break i make no claim that this will stay cohesive all the way through. 

I present, before i really get rolling, my credentials: i am a student, going on two years now, at the Mythgard Institute (http://mythgard.org/), an online school dedicated to the study of genre literature in general and Tolkien in particular, where i am purusing a masters in Tolkien Studies. I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, an expert on Tolkien, but i have dedicated what i expect is a substantially greater number of hours studying his work than the average person. 

My goal with this rant is to provide some background as to why and how Tolkien wrote about the elves, with the hope that once you see what his intentions were you will treat them less like a trope to be included and skinned, and think more critically about their FUNCTION. 

I do not believe it would be productive, or even possible necessarily, to reproduce in full the chronology of Tolkien's invention of the elves. Instead, i will focus on what we can know of his intentions. To that end, i would direct the interested reader to an essay he published in 1947 based on a lecture he gave in 1939 called ""On Fairy-Stories"". You can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fairy_Stories or you can do a bit of googling and find the whole text. (truthfully, this should be required reading for worldbuilders ANYWAY since it, along with his poem Mythopoeia (http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/mythopoeia.html) are a call to arms and manifesto, so to speak, to what he called Subcreators but what we call worldbuilders) In this text he summarizes and describes fairy stories of the past and then puts forward his theory about what purpose these stories can serve: recovery, entertainment, and consolation. It is the first of these that seems to have been the primary reason for this own elves. 

Tolkien's elves are a recovery of the epic heroes and the fairy myths that inspired him to write in the first place, recasting the traditional folk figures into a new shape. HOWEVER he did not do so simply because he thought fairies were bitchin'. As evidenced by the scope and depth of the world he built for them, he was thinking FAR bigger than that. 

People like to say that between Tolkien and his good friend Lewis, Lewis was the more religious of the two. I won't go so far as to say they're wrong, but they're certainly not carefully examining Tolkien's works. While he did not wear his religion on his sleeve, as one can see from his poem Mythopoeia Tolkien had a strong belief that as being made in the image of a Creator, the act of subcreation was not merely flight of fancy. He treated it with reverence. So it should not be any surprise, then, that he used his created world to examine and reflect on spiritual issues, recovering in effect those topics that challenged him. 

Chief among the tools that he used to do this, even more so than the Ainulindale or the Valar, were the Elves. He gave the a different relationship with God, from their fall and salvation right down to the relationship of their souls to their bodies. While his intentions were absolutely literary as much as they were spiritual, one should not ignore these motivations when considering WHY Tolkien became so fascinated with his elves. They were not just heroes tragic and epic to him, more even than the recovery of fairy tale tropes and epic tales. 

Consequently, when you sit down to create your own worlds, think LONG and HARD about WHY you want elves. Do they serve a purpose in your world, in your stories? are they there because they're elves and thats what fantasy has? or do they do something meaningful in the context of your world or story? Tolkien was as bad as ANY of us when it came to including things he thought were cool. Dragons, while he absolutely put them to excellent narrative use, were by his own admission simply too fucking cool not to include. His prolific language creation was a hinderance as much as a help, but he loved them so he included them at every turn. My point is not that you shouldn't include things that are cool, but i do STRONGLY believe that you should think carefully about adopting any of the traditional tropes, themes, and features fantasy stories without carefully considering what they can do for what you're building. 

tl;dr - Tolkien elves were a rich, layered creation. don't disrespect that effort by giving them funny hair colors and pretending you're doing something clever. think about the world you want to build and the stories you want to tell, and then populate and customize it with that in mind rather than simply duping the traditional elements for no better reason than they're there. 

edit: if you're interesting in reading more about the depth of Tolkien's creations, in addition to the links above i recommend the following:

* Leaf by Niggle
* Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth
* The Tale of Adanel

(the last two of the above are included in The History of Middle Earth vol 10, Morgoth's Ring)

Me and my players don't really buy the whole ""everything elven takes years to master"" it just seems like elves must be incredibly slow learners until they take character levels. Same general grip for dwarves, and any long lived race.

It works in your standard tolkeinesque fantasy, but when trying to do something more cosmopolitan it causes issues, like if a dwarf family was living in a town with humans, would the dwarf kids learn as fast as the human kids? 

Anyway I wanted to share some of the things I have done to change elves and dwarves to make them fit in better with the shorter lived races.

**Elves -**
Elves go feral. Every 30-60 years an elf will lose their ability to reason and become a wild creature. This period lasts a few years, after which they are rejuvenated in both body and mind. The older an elf gets, the longer they can go between feral times, but the longer the feral period lasts.

The event is described by elves as a call from mother nature, and it can be resisted for a time. When an elf finally does surrender to the wild, they change in a matte of days. The re-awakening is often described the same way.

While Feral the elf's behaviour is indicative of the kind of person they are. Some elves become solitary predators, others group up and behave more like apes. Elves lose most of the details of their life after each feral period, but retain their personality. This amnesia never really goes away, but strong connections can survive the feral period.

Different tribes of elves have different traditions on how they treat their feral members, both during and after. The most common practice used to be to just let the elf go free in the wild, and that any elf who returned to reason was for all intents, a new person. When elves society came into close and constant contact with other races, it became more common to create ""wildlife preserves"" or special parks in the city for their feral brethren to live. This protects the feral elves from other people, as well as the other way around.

-Human reactions
Humans are the ones who use the term feral. It has been a sore spot in Human/Elf relations for a while, as humans seem to find the elven condition humours and deserving of mockery, while the elves find the humans rude. It doesn't help that feral elves had been responsible for injuring or killing human foresters and hunters for decades before the humans learned what was going on with the elves.

**Dwarves-**
The children of the forge god are peculiar to most outsiders who do not know their history. Literally crafted by their god, the dwarves minds are much like the metal in the forge. They start out hot and formless, and through careful moulding and hammering, become shaped into something more. This is more than a metaphor for the dwarves. Dwarf children are quick witted and impressionable, but as a dwarf ages, they become more and more set in their ways. This leads to very old dwarves becoming so entrenched in routine that they might as well be automatons. Dwarven society is structured and in fact engineered so that each person can act as a cog in a well oiled machine.

Dwarves are not doomed to becoming more and more static, life any tool, the mind can be re-forged, repaired or changed from one thing to another. Dwarves call in ""the spark"" All the youth have it, and it fades as their lives become more and more routine, but through profound experiences a dwarves spark may be relit, and they may regain the flexibility of their youth. It turns out that this flexibility is a bit literal, as dwarves that have lived long enough without disruption turn to stone.

Many things can cause a spark in a dwarf, all unique to the dwarf in question. Art tends to be a consistent trigger for dwarves, and their dedication to crafting and creating great works is partly to help inspire future dwarves and prevent the stagnation of their people. Many whisper that the great parties thrown by dwarves are another attempt to keep their sparks alive.

A dwarf that is ignited is a valuable resource, and many dwarves use the time to better themselves. The spark does not necessarily mean change, it can just mean refinement. Like an old blade, it an be reforged to a new tool, or just recast to give it a better edge. 

Dwarven is split between the traditionalists, and those currently being iconoclasts. Dwarven kings are figureheads, as most of the law is handled by the hot and cold councils. The cold council uphold the tradition, while the hot council acts as devils advocate to try and find the parts of the law that are wearing thin. Dwarves do surprisingly well in mixed society, their steadfast natures cause them to end up being the backbone of many groups, be they farmers or aristocrats.

-Human reactions
Humans are actually fairly horrified by how dwarves ""cool"" It is like seeing a somebody one succumb to a mental disease. 

**Reasons-**
My elves are basically going through rebirth every so often, allowing them to have the wisdom of ages, but have a reason for not outstripping humanity and the other short lived races.
My dwarves are closer to classic interpretations, and I think this format allows me to have the classic dwarf stubbornness, but with a twist. an 120 year old lvl 1 elven adventurer, may be fresh out of being feral, but had no friends when he returned so set out for a new life. The 120 year old dwarf was a guard most of his life, when a goblin raid inspired him to take the battle to the monsters that threatened his home.

**What twists would you put on how fantasy races age?
What do you think of my ideas?**

So I thought I'd share them.  I'm sure I missed some cool things, so if you know of others, describe them!

**Traps**

[Traps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps) form when lava floods out in huge eruptions over an area the size of a medium sized nation.  These are basalt eruptions, so think lava flows like those on Hawaii, not so much Pompeii style volcanoes.  You are probably thinking ""Hey!  It's just like Mordor!"" Which is fair enough, if you catch things near an eruption.  But remember that volcanic soil is fertile, and for a geologist, once every thousand years is continuous.  The fossil beds between individual lava flows are filled with frogs and freshwater mussels.  You might get a situation with patches of jungle (or glacier, or forest, or whatever) scattered between areas of recent lava flow.  On the other hand, a big eruption like this can be pretty hard on the ecology of the planet as a whole...a really massive trap producing eruption may have caused the Permian extinction.

**Polar forests**

Tropical and temperate polar regions were actually fairly common over earth's history.  Imagine a polar day-night cycle superimposed on a temperate forest.  During the summer, the sun never sets, plants and animals thrive.  During the winter, the trees drop their useless leaves during a months-long night and most animals dig in for the long sleep...but perhaps some night adapted animals wake up hunt the forests or browse on root and bark.

**Fern covered, freshwater oceans**

The [Azolla event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event) occurred in one of these tropical-pole times, when the climate was much warmer and the arctic ocean mostly landlocked.  High levels of precipitation and low water circulation basically caused fresh water to completely flood the surface of the arctic ocean.  In this freshwater layer grew a huge endless mat of the freshwater fern Azolla.  When the fern died, it sank down into the anoxic saltwater below, building up in huge layers and removing enough CO2 to cause temperatures to drop drastically.  Now, it's cool enough to have this on the North Pole, but you could have such a freshwater-covered sea anywhere there's a landlocked sea and lots of surrounding precipitation.  If the Caspian or Black Sea was found in a wetter area, the same thing could happen.   Just imagine sailing through an ocean covered with [huge purplish clumps of the stuff ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5nk5UMKMNGj_cLvdLpPxo9Y8gcz6CN92D46nSVOOTSBQVRliS).  Added bonus:  Anything which sinks to the deep salt layer will be preserved in the anoxic environment, just like shipwrecks in the Black Sea are today.

**Mammoth steppe**

 Now lets look at the other end of the climate spectrum, and consider glacial landscapes.  The only two landmasses covered with ice sheets today (Greenland and Antarctica) are almost _completely_ covered.  During the ice age (or if Antarctica melts halfway, for that matter) [an ice sheet comes to an end on a continent](http://wisconsingeologicalsurvey.org/ice_age.htm).  This can leave a cliff of ice hundreds of feet high overlooking a dry, grassy, and very cold plain of [Mammoth steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe).

**Glacial Lakes**

If this ice sheet starts melting, all that water has to go somewhere.  It may drain off downhill, but what if ""downhill"" is to the north, under miles of ice?   Then [a truly huge lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Agassiz) can form.  A single large glacial lake was much larger than any lake today, and teemed with fish and even seals.  Alas, they don't last long, and eventually the ice dam holding them in melts,  releasing the water in a series of huge floods which can be big enough to affect worldwide ocean circulation and sea level.

**Empty seas**

Finally, we have empty ocean basins.  Several times the [Mediterranean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis) dried out, leaving behind an enormous deep, dry salt flat.  This must have been a very harsh environment, something like the dead sea and Death Valley multiplied.  Winding through it were rivers draining down into nothing and evaporating, and scattered across it were plateaus of former islands, still [islands of relative cool and moisture](http://www.southwestlearning.org/topics/montane-forests) due to their elevation.

1346872550.0,60,self.worldbuilding,zeo5m,"[Guide] Basic Language, Place Names, and You.",Shagomir,73,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/zeo5m/guide_basic_language_place_names_and_you/,"A couple of recent posts have inspired me to provide a basic guide to help generate place names. A lot of people seem to lack the confidence to create place names that fit their world. Here are a few things to help make this process a little easier.

What I have realized, is that place names don't have to be hard. Most place names are just some description of the local features, or of the role of the town itself. Look at a map of England. You'll see a lot of ""Tradeford"", ""Blackpool"", """"Beaconsfield"", ""Braintree"", and other descriptive town names. The same thing is true in Japan - ""Tokyo"" means ""Eastern Capital"", and ""Hiroshima"" means ""Wide Island"".

Another thing that we see in names is repetition. Again, this comes from language. ""Nottingham"" and ""Birmingham"" both use the suffix ""-ham"", which means a small village or hamlet. You see it in Germany too with ""Salzburg"", ""Hamburg"", and ""Brandenburg"" where ""-burg"" means a town. You might also consider that a place could be named after a mythical or historical figure, like ""Alexandria"" or ""Leningrad"".  If you really look into it, many of the place names we use every day are very ordinary.

This is the secret to naming places. To get started, you would want to develop a simple, consistent language for each culture group to use when naming places. I have found that the easiest way to start this is a simple spreadsheet containing common words. [I have prepared a sample spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak9jVNCB7ZzOdDFsRlZieTEydmVZY3Z6R3FaVEFuMXc), which you can use as a template. If you need words that aren't on the spreadsheet, you can just add them. 

Now, you're going to ask ""Isn't it really overwhelming to make up a new language?"" I'm glad you asked, because it can be. The trick is to start small, and only create words as you need them. Let the characters in your world name the location themselves. Think about what specific local features the original settlers or later inhabitants would have used to distinguish themselves. Was there a mythical or historical person who founded the town? Did a conquering king re-name it after himself or a symbol important to him? Did it get started as a town named after a religious concept? 

Let's say you have a town that is distinguished by three large monoliths sticking out of the ground that are visible for miles. They might call it ""Three Stone Town"" in their native language, but you might decide to call it ""Urt Basan"". You determine that ""Urt"" means ""town"", ""Ba-"" means three, and ""san"" means ""stone"". You would then fill in these words on your spreadsheet. Later, if you name another place ""Green Stone Tower"" you can reference the language you've created, and you might call it ""Tur Sanaut"", where ""Tur"" means ""tower"" and ""Aut"" means ""green"". Later, you decide that King Greenbeard (That's King Autfrist when translated) conquered a small town and named it after himself, calling it ""Urt Autfrist"". You've just created a language and a consistent naming system to use when creating your world. 

The key is to name places in your world as if you were someone living in that world. In the real world, different names come from different languages and cultures even in places close to each other. Consider ""Los Angeles"" and ""Bakersfield"", which are Spanish and English names respectively. If you have a detailed history, you can include place names in the ancient languages that inhabited the region, even if they are fragmentary. You can also mix languages to create place names, or even include pleonasms like ""The La Brea Tar Pits"", which means ""The The Tar Tar Pits"" when fully translated. 

This method allows you to consider a place's history and language, and allows you to build that into the name while making it much easier to come up with a consistently good naming convention. You don't have to get crazy with the detail, but a meaningful place name can be a good start into building a rich, vibrant history for your world.

The populace fears just about any magic user, calls them pejorative terms like ""warlock"" and such (that's THEIR word...I kid). Their major arc is one of moving back into the foreground to guide humanity for the better, to help save the protagonists and protagonist loyalists from the BIG BADS. Their kind started off as tyrants and enslaved the people, fought each other to near extinction, formed a truce and became rulers of a grand empire, turned into a type of celebrity, the empire falls for reasons outside of their hands, they flee, then.....they just chill out for like a thousand years (for the most part) until the events of my story.

I'm looking for reasons why they wouldn't just breed like rabbits, form an army, and take over the world. I have some in mind, but I'm curious what others have come up with to keep them in check (other than magic is limited and tiring and even 1000 mages have to sleep sometime).",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_17lc3g,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/17lc3g/why_arent_the_magic_users_in_your_world_supreme/,

1352566835.0,61,self.worldbuilding,12yvkj,Blank map projections (no Earthly landmasses) for use in fictional map-making.,vede,66,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/12yvkj/blank_map_projections_no_earthly_landmasses_for/,"So a recent worldbuilding [project](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/12v014/41_pages_of_documentation_on_my_world_yonn_sothor/) of mine went belly-up because I ignorantly drew my world map (the basis for the rest of the project) on a flat piece of paper without concerning myself with the spherical nature of planets.

As a solution for future projects I decided I would need some blank map projections to put my world maps on, but Googling for these things turned up nothing (and if it had I'm sure the results would have been woefully low-resolution jpeg's which would just not be up to par in my book).

So I set to work making some SVG's of the four projections which - in my opinion - are most conducive to fictional map-making. And in the spirit of community and brotherhood, I'm putting the results of my effort here for everyone's use.

* Mercator [(Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection)
 * [SVG](http://www.mediafire.com/?is66zarc2s21nid)
 * [PNG](http://i.imgur.com/5OH9i.png)

* Miller [(Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_projection)
 * [SVG](http://www.mediafire.com/?sg8m09nn9m5a3l5)
 * [PNG](http://i.imgur.com/lqOIa.png)

* Mollweide [(Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollweide_projection)
 * [SVG](http://www.mediafire.com/?58kw5h844tw9s84)
 * [PNG, fine](http://i.imgur.com/lfio8.png)
 * [PNG, broad](http://i.imgur.com/VHQZy.png)

* Eckert IV [(Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert_IV_projection)
 * [SVG](http://www.mediafire.com/?hc415hon47drmg3)
 * [PNG, fine](http://i.imgur.com/jveoe.png)
 * [PNG, broad](http://i.imgur.com/gOqGS.png)

[And here's all of them in a single file!](http://www.mediafire.com/?0v3rju0msf5bs03)

Tech notes:
These SVG files are Inkscape SVG files, so it's recommended you edit them in Inkscape (they'll still work if you don't, but on Mollweide and Eckert IV I have the lines that should be removed to make the ""broad"" versions in a group so you can select them all at once, which can only be preserved after saving and reloading in Inkscape and Inkscape-compatible SVG editors).

The PNG renders above are at 90dpi. You can always render them at a higher resolution from any old SVG editor. If you want thicker lines you can also do that in any editor, just select all and change the stroke width. Everything is either bezier curves or straight lines so it's all very simple.

And an obligatory disclaimer: these projections are not 100% mathematically accurate (although they are as close as I could get them without writing some code to render them mathematically), so if you try to use them to aim a nuclear missile test and ""accidentally"" kill millions of people, that's not my fault.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_12yvkj,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/12yvkj/blank_map_projections_no_earthly_landmasses_for/,

1364931708.0,56,self.worldbuilding,1bjany,[Moderator Post] Discussion - Community Posting Guidelines,Shagomir,62,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1bjany/moderator_post_discussion_community_posting/,"As we approach 15,000 users, I though that it would be helpful to put into place some community posting guidelines. Ideally, the guidelines that we put in place will not seek to change the current character or content of this subreddit, as I feel that we have an excellent community already. The ultimate goal is not to create a set of draconian rules, but to create a set of flexible guidelines that will help new and existing users understand what our community is about. 

To that end, we have created a rough draft for posting guidelines, based on the discussion that occured in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/17chcq/too_many_maps_a_solution/) several months ago, as well as several other posts and moderator discussions since then. 

I feel that any guidelines we enact as a community should embrace the following goals:

1. We should encourage the posting of original content from our users.
2. We should encourage high-quality discussion. 
3. We should encourage the posting of material that is on-topic.
4. We should discourage the exploitation of our community.

To that end, here is the current draft for the community posting guidelines:

1. All posts should be related to worldbuilding in a general sense. Your post title should clearly indicate how your post relates to worldbuilding.
2. Almost any content relating to worldbuilding is appropriate here, including guides, tutorials, communities, projects, questions, and discussions. 
3. Posts about a fictional world that you have created are encouraged regardless of format or quality of content. Posts about a fictional world that you did not create are discouraged.
4. Your post should not be exploitative. This includes offers to create content for money or requests for other people to do work for you regardless of compensation. These posts will be removed. 
5. Please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldbuilding) for pre-approval before posting a link to a Kickstarter or other crowd-funded project.   
6. Please follow [Reddit's spamming guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#toc_43) when self-promoting. Failure to do so can and will result in a ban from the Reddit Admins. 

The first four guidelines directly address the goals above, while the last two are there to address specific moderation issues we have seen lately. 

Please reply to this post with any questions, concerns, criticism, or ideas you may have. I will be monitoring this discussion, and I will try to respond to everyone I can. In a few days I will post a follow-up with any revisions before moving forward with this. 

*For visibility, I ask that you please upvote this self-post, for which I receive no Karma.*

1372527526.0,54,self.worldbuilding,1hbia6,"If you had to make a list of the 10 most powerful or destructive creatures in your universe, what would they be?",NathanielWeber,66,12,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1hbia6/if_you_had_to_make_a_list_of_the_10_most_powerful/,"My list would be as follows:

1. Greater Titans: These elementals live in the Spheres of Power within the twisting Fae Wilds. They are massive, extremely powerful, highly intelligent, and a choice few are worshiped as gods. They are surpassed only by true deities in terms of power.
2. Tie: Leviathan/Behemoth/Ziz: The Leviathan is a large, very rare creature that somewhat resembles a cross between a lizard and a fish. They usually reside only in the deepest trenches of the ocean, but when they come to the surface, they cause massive title waves and tsunamis that can shatter cities. Behemoths, living as close to the molten core as possible, somewhat resemble a large, thickly hided rhino, with tusks like an elephant and a hide like an anklyosuar. They are seen even less than Leviathans, but when they come to the surface, you'll know. The Ziz is by far the rarest, as it lives in the ozone layer, never needing to touch ground if it doesn't want to. Somewhat like a very large archaeopteryx, it can create typhoons just by gliding down into the atmosphere.
3. Drake: Imagine a wyvern the size of a couple of mountains. Fortunately for humanity, Drakes are near extinct, and make their home in the middle of the ocean.
4. Dracolich: A Dragon that has performed the necessary ritual to achieve sentient undeath.
5. Lesser Titan: Far weaker than their larger, godlike relatives, these Titans often serve as guardians in the various Spheres of Power of the Fae Wilds, usually under the direct command of a Greater Titan
6. Dragon: Self explanatory
7. Demon Lord: The commanding generals of the the Nether, Demon Lords exceed other, less powerful demons usually by displaying an unusual power granted to them by the demonic powers that be that rules over the Nether. One such Demon Lord, Bahamuut the Chained Devil, became so powerful and power mad that he was locked away by his own kind.
8. Lich Lord: A powerful necromancer that has achieved sentient undeath, the closest a mortal will ever come to immortality.
9. Tyrannosaurus Caesar: Found only on the Rouge's Isle off the coast of Aerulin, these massive dinosaurs display no high intelligence or magical powers, yet size unimaginable. They resemble the average Tyrannosaurus Rex, but with more useful, developed arms, and two long rows of spikes down it's back.
10. Ragohnian Earth Wurm: Ranging from 15-30 feet long, and thickness ranging from 8-12 feet, these creatures burrow beneath the Ragohnian Desert, striking suddenly from below the surface with razor sharp teeth. They burrow in the ground with such speed and litheness, they have sometimes been called the Barracuda of the Wastes. The only thing that prevents these creatures from destroying entire towns is the fact that being blind, they have developed a sense of radar that allows them to track their prey by listening to the vibrations of footsteps and voices. Because of this, the bustle and mass numbers of large cities throw off and distort this radar, making them unable to focus, and even inducing bad migraines. Living to close to a city can cause these wurms to suffer brain damage, so they are found in the most barren places of the desert, preferring to pick off lone travelers.

For the sake of the list, only include creatures that feasibly would actually act on a destructive nature. For example, in my world, there exist great creatures called Kain Birds. They would probably rank somewhere between a Dragon and a Demon Lord but they are generally docile and protective so I elected not to place them on the list. Also, refrain from using unique creatures, i. e., creatures of which there exist only one.

EDIT: Zyvron has a point, go ahead and include creatures that have the capacity to be destructive, whether docile or not

1367369713.0,54,self.worldbuilding,1dg8gc,"""Laconia"", the forest of silence where the trees actually feed on sound.",MrEctomy,66,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1dg8gc/laconia_the_forest_of_silence_where_the_trees/,"Orton used to be a mostly uninteresting region of plains, populated by nomads and wanderers with a few villages dotted across the countryside. There are no major rivers, so most people had little interest in colonizing it. But that was before the Silent Wood.

The region of Orton is home to ""The Silent Wood"" which seems to be a forest of pure silence...here, all sound is swallowed instantly by the trees that populate the forest, a bizarre creation of a mage named Alkane who is said to have created the seeds and planted the forest himself.

The story of Alkane can be found on the various carvings etched into large boulders that can be found throughout the forest: in the village that he lived in, the residents suddenly found themselves all deaf. No healing magic or remedies seemed to work...they asked for help from other cities, but the rumor about the ""village of the deaf"" only excited bandits and other criminals. They raided the city and took advantage of their disability. In response, he created the seeds of the Sound Swallower Trees, which required sound in order to grow.

(How did they all become deaf?)

Alkane explained to the other villagers that they could move to the northwestern part of the region near the coast and rebuild their village there, in a beautiful forest of complete silence where, if anyone wished them harm, they would have to be deaf as well. And he infused the seeds as such that the trees would, over time, allow them to develop tremorsense so that they could survive attackers and detect danger without sound. They all agreed to come. 

(Alkane actually cursed the city and caused everyone to go deaf?)

Deaf citizens of other nations were also welcome in his haven. They named this place ""Laconia"".

In order to help them operate as a community, the residents of Laconia developed a form of sign language so that they can communicate.
Over time, wildlife migrated to the forest and they, too, developed tremorsense. 

As you might expect, their culture relies heavily on the visual...the forest itself is incredibly beautiful. The variation in tones and sounds allow the trees to all be very different from one another, as the sounds that they feed on vary. Because of this, the trees' leaves are all sorts of different sizes, shapes, and colors. Walking into the forest is like walking into an explosion of color. There is said to be few places in Belorin as beautiful as the Silent Wood. The forest itself actually comes alive, many of the trees swaying and moving around when the entire village joins together for their nightly ""Performance"", in which the residents all join together in the square and strum musical instruments, clearly without any idea what they're playing, but the trees don't seem to mind at all.

It's an amazing sight: a large group of people sitting together in the village square surrounded by colorful trees, all singing and playing instruments mutely, the trees swaying and shedding leaves of all colors of the rainbow, showering them all.

----

So that's the basic idea of this place. I'm wondering how I can turn this place into a quest of sorts for the players. I'm thinking maybe they discover something about how the village came to become deaf, long after the residents even care. It obviously has to be something they probably don't want to know, and probably involving Alkane...",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1dg8gc,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1dg8gc/laconia_the_forest_of_silence_where_the_trees/,

**The TL;DR of the setting is: Lovecraftian daemons invaded, completely fucked humans, human society and reality itself. Your garden-variety post-apocalypse with non-Euclidean monstrosities from beyond the stars instead of nukes and a healthy dose of STALKER trappings (anomalies, artifacts).**

[Here's a map](http://i.imgur.com/qHxXT.jpg) The hexes are about 25km across.

The setting is quite heavily inspired by the *STALKER* series of computer games, *Carcosa* RPG by McKinney and *Under a Serpent Sun* setting for Burning Wheel when it comes to the monsters, magics and metaphysics. The factions and societies are inspired by a little bit of everything, from Fallout to Tribe 8.

Here is a short introduction to the setting:


**Welcome to Hell**

We’re not sure when, but before anyone alive today was born, hell’s gates opened and daemons spilled forth onto Earth. At least that what most people call them. Maybe they’re quite literally from Hell, maybe they’re beings from the dark between the stars, maybe they’re the Ancient’s fears made manifest. Whatever the case, they came, they conquered, and for reasons unknown, most of them left.


**Mutants**

When the daemons first came, they enslaved us. Some, they corrupted, changed against their will. Sometimes, these mutants look just like the rest of us, but are strong like ten men. Sometimes, they are hulking brutes or slithering masses of flesh. Some retain part of their humanity, some cannot be told apart from the daemons that created them. Some have intermingled with humans and given birth to unblessed progeny, some stalk the wastelands. Universally, however well-adjusted, good-hearted and harmless a mutant or his offspring may be, they are mistrusted, reviled, feared, shunned and more often greeted with pitchforks and torches than with handshakes.


**Flora and Fauna**

The daemons not only corrupted man, they corrupted the plants and animals as well. From the spider-wolves and crockroaches that are as common as dogs and hares once were to shambling behemoths and awe-inspiring leviathans, venus mantraps and tree-sized mushrooms, the altered life-forms are something that the surviving humans have gotten used to. Indeed, most know nothing else.


**Technology**

There are, of course, ruins remaining of the cities of the Ancients. Their cracked highways cut across the wastelands, their towers stretch into the sky like the fingers of a drowning man reaching for salvation. Their ships, their size often dwarfing even the largest villages, are washed ashore. Relics of their technology can be found, scavenged, and sold for profit.

In the default setting, assume the available tech level before the Apocalypse was five minutes into the future, or 2020’s. Assume whatever time has passed since the Apocalypse is exactly equal to whatever is convenient for the story at hand. The level of technology available to common folk varies between is mid-1800’s (or what you’d find in a frontier town in a western movie) and 1960’s.

The Order of the Pure Strain and the Cheyenne and White River Republics all still produce items of technological prowess that in some cases may rival the Ancients. The more benign daemonic Artifacts can duplicate functions of some pre-Apocalypse technology. All of these items are still valuable and rare, however. 


**Terrain**

Apart from the mutated plants and animals, the terrain has been shaped by the daemons in other ways. Their black citadels and non-Euclidean cityscapes release toxic smog of fluoride or sulphur, while anomalies have formed glaciers, tundras, swamps and jungles in the most unlikely places. Some cities are overgrown by the surrounding plant life, or simply reclaimed by the desert, while wastelands entirely of ash, glass and craters can stretch for miles.


**Daemons**

The daemons themselves are hardly ever seen anymore, thank god. They came in force, they killed, raped, ate and mutated. Then almost every single one left. Back into the dark reaches of space or the crushing depths of the oceans, except for a few. The only trait daemons have in common, is that their true forms are huge. They may be a shambling mass of tentacles dwarfing the mightiest of the Ancient’s sky towers, or they may be a flock of bone-white ravens a million individuals strong.


**Anomalies**

Whatever hellscape the daemons came from is bleeding into our world. There are places where the laws of physics no longer apply – or where history has been rewritten so that they never applied. A pool of blood that drips upwards, a fire that burns black with cold, a ball of lightning that has been stationary for a week or a rust-colored field of air that sucks passers-by into itself. Some anomalies are seemingly permanent and stable, while some blink in and out of existence, move, grow, shrink or disappear.


**Artifacts**

In the anomalies, artifacts are  formed. The wielder of an artifact may call upon its power to shield him from harm, to make him strong like an ox, or to see into the future. Due to their permanence and semblance or reliability, artifacts are often utilized in a technological fashion, serving as power-sources or enhancing a tool’s or weapon’s effect. Artifacts are almost universally dangerous, however, provoking the ire of daemons, slowly corrupting the wielder or emitting ionizing radiation.


**Corpses**

One of the first things man came to discover after the daemons came, was that the dead were restless. After trial and fatal error, it was discovered that a human who dies will be inanimate for exactly seven hours and six minutes. After that, the corpse – still rotting and in all but behavior technically dead – will rise. The zombie will seek to feast upon the flesh of the living, but will stop eating as soon as the victim expires. The re-animation is quite easy to prevent, however. A corpse whose head is separated from the body will not rise. Neither will a smoldering heap of ash or anything else that results in the destruction of the body. Body parts that are separated from the body will not rise even if the body does. In the larger settlements, bodies are most often cremated. In villages and among nomads, especially if a funeral pyre would attract attention or be a waste of fuel, the body is buried, with the head severed and placed in a spike where you would expect to see a headstone, or simply placed upon the grave. A zombie who has risen, however, will not be stopped by the destruction or severing of its head, but will have to be burned, submerged in acid or trapped until it falls apart from decay. Body parts separated from an already risen zombie will stay animate until they decay.

Zombies are rare nowadays, because we have learned how to avoid creating them. They can be encountered in the wastelands, but rarely in large numbers.


**Red Storms**

The weather hasn’t changed much. Due to the weapons of mass destruction used against the daemons when humanity still thought it had a fighting chance, the rain is sometimes acidic or radioactive. Other than the rain, the sun shines – sometimes – and the snow falls in wintertime. On occasion, however, the red storms roll over the horizon. The mad cackling of the daemonic cities can be heard for miles, the shambling corpses all stare at the sky in unison and animals stampede. Those not hunkered down when the sky burns and it rains ashes, are seldom seen again – at least not with both mind and body intact.


**Sorcery**

We do not know why or how, but inventive humans have learned to manipulate the strange energies that the daemons and their anomalies have let loose upon the world. Sorcery is feared among most folk, while other groups practice it openly. Learning to wield magic is an arduous process, and a dangerous one, but the rewards can be substantial. Sorcery is conducted via rituals – some take place over the course of days or months and can only be performed in certain places or times of the year, while some take minutes and only require minor sacrifice.

It is magic, after all, it is reasonable to just handwave anything and say ""it's magic"".

But for those of you who, like me, really like to get to the nitty gritty of stuff, how do you explain it?

In my world, magic works like a programmable energy that affects reality.
The following is an entry from my wiki, and not common knowledge to wizards in the world.

Also, i try to use some vocabulary with which i'm not overly familiar with.

Magic can be understood as an organization of a specific kind of electromagnetic radiaton, Mana, that creates energetic patterns that interfere with chemical reactions and physical interactions, thus affecting reality. Mana occurs naturally, unexplored and unused, manifesting as a disorganized but powerful form of energy. Some biological beings are capable of perceiving and even manipulating that energy, shaping it and using it.


**Mana**

Mana is a charged particle of the electromagnetic spectrum, with both electric and magnetic field components, that makes up matter.

Certain elements and materials have more Mana than others. Mana is highly reactive, interfering easily with physical and chemical interactions, acting as a catalyst. Mana will often dramatically change the output or nature of energy transfomations. It can, for example, increase the temperature of air molecule interactions to the point where the gases ignite, or transform sound vibrations into gravitic forces originating levitation when loud sounds are created. These changes can occur naturaly and spontaneously in nature, giving rise to so-called magical phenomena.

Mana will also occur in several states of disorder or organization. The more organized Mana is, the more complex will its interactions be.

Any kind of matter will have different, but specific, levels of Mana output and organization. The Mana output and organization of an object depend specifically on its structure and nacture. Therefore a rock, a stream, a tree, a mountain, animals and people, all have their own individual Mana fingerprint, which can be felt or manipulated by those who can detect them.

 
**Magic**

Magic, in the true sense of the word, corresponds to the basic essential informational code in which Mana organizes itself, and according to which observable effects are produced in the environment.
Each unit of Magical Code and it's corresponding effect is called a Spell.

The language in which spells are expressed can take almost any form, be it symbolic, written, phonetic, gestural, ritual or even architectonic or pyrotechnic. Almost any kinf od information code can be used to manipulate the organization of Mana, as long as it is coherent and correctly executed.
Naturally there are languages that are more or less efficient, and executions which are more or less difficult to accomplish, varying accordingly to the desired effect.

So, the same Create Fire spell could be coded as phonetic sounds, gestural hand motions or symbols on parchment. Likewise, a Demon Summoning Spell could simply be written down on the floor as chalk symbols, whereas its phonetic form could take days to fully enunciate. A Levitation Spell that for a Magic initiate could involve complex words and gestures, could, for a more experienced Master in tune with Mana, require a simple flick of the wrist.

Magic, as a tool of reality alteration, is limited only by the existing quantity of Mana available, the efficiency of its code and the ability and creativity of the user.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1h7ahh,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1h7ahh/how_does_magic_work_in_your_world/,

1339131101.0,52,self.worldbuilding,ur3t1,Making a world map with gimp! (x-post from /rpg),sjalt,69,17,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ur3t1/making_a_world_map_with_gimp_xpost_from_rpg/,"Step 1: find your muse, get an idea of what you want to draw, what general shape you want for the continent, how big?
	For this tutorial im going to use [this](http://i.imgur.com/ucff1.jpg) hand drawn map (courtesy of reconditecache). and turn it into [this](http://i.imgur.com/czUEi.jpg)

	NOTE:You will notice as this goes along that my map is fairly off of the original sketch. If you load your sketch into gimp and keep going back to it as sort of a guide while making your map, it will be MUCH more accurate than what I am accomplishing here

Step 2: Find a background image, The ""paper"" you want to put it on. I am going to use [this](http://chaletvaleriane.co.uk/flash/images/parchment-paper-texture-free-5511.png) because I already have it on my computer, and its of roughly the size i am going to have my final map (1024x768)

Step 3: Open it up in gimp![Image](http://i.imgur.com/iPEhi.jpg)

Step 4: Now it is time to draw out your continent. Make a new layer, then use the Free select tool to make a basic outline of your continent, and then use the Bucket fill tool to fill it in nice and black.
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/kglyS.jpg)

Step 5: Deselect everything and grab the eraser tool, We are going to rough up the coast a bit.Get a brush with a 100 harness, this is needed as this layer is going to be used to make selections. Now go along the coast, roughly scrubbing it in a bit, with different sized brushes. (you can add ""jitter"" to your strokes through the dynamics options in the tool)If you cut part of the continent off, its now an island, which adds some more realism to your coast
	Wooo! Turns out pretty cool! so, the black is our land, the rest is the ocean, dont forget to save!
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/zUmWJ.jpg)

Step 6: Now lets make an outline, get your magic wand select tool, and select the ""ocean"" area, then invert the selection. Add a new layer, and then right click on the image, go to Edit&gt;Stroke Selection, make it 1 pixel wide, and hit it! We now have a border. 
        [Here it is wuth the continent layer hidden](http://i.imgur.com/hfc3n.jpg) You can keep that layer hidden for the rest of the tutorial, but don't delete it
	Hey look, we got ourselves a map! its not very useful at this point, so lets differentiate the land and the sea.
	Make a new layer, now go to your gradient tool, we are going to flood the whole screen with what you want the ocean to look like. I advise a darkish grey/blue with about a 25% opacity, the ""radial"" shape is a nice filter for it, but a flat darker color works pretty well as well.
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/szEDZ.jpg)
	Change to the continent layer, and use the magic wand selection tool to select the ocean, Now right click on the ocean layerin the layers window, and clcik ""add layer mask"", and initialize the layer mask to ""selection""
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/7hvkh.jpg)


Step 7: Now lets add some of those cool little lines around the coasts that maps have! select the ocean layer, use magic wand, then under the select menu, press ""shrink"" tool and shrink the selection, i shrank it by 5 pixels. Then trace the selection, I changed the line style to dash. yay! adorable little outline around our islands and coast.
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/hCrlN.jpg)

Step 8: I am going to use similar effectsthat i did to make the ""continent layer"" to make the gorge running through the center of the map. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/3muoR.jpg) I then traced it, like the continent, then used the select tool to select the inside, then filled it with a ""shaped (angular)"" fill with the gradient tool. (black to red) [Image](http://i.imgur.com/hkJa8.jpg).
	It looks a little to vivid, compared with the style we want, so we are going to make a mask. right click the layer, and select ""add layer mask"", and select white ""Full opacity"". Then use a patterend brush, painted black, to wash out the gorge a little bit. I then went back to the layerm and added some gry splotches with the same brush to add some ""mystery"" to the gorge
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/HfCN8.jpg)

Step 9: Lets add some forest! Make a new layer, call it Forest. now we need to find a forest textureI am using [this](http://i.imgur.com/GTBpV.jpg). Drag it into the new layer [Image](http://i.imgur.com/0vcJr.jpg), and the go to Filters&gt;Map&gt;Make Seamless. Then Colors &gt; Color to Alpha. This should let you make it see through cept where there are trees
	Scale it so that the texture is about the right size and move it to the top-left of the image. Then go Filters&gt;Map&gt;tile. Put in the size of your image (1024x768 for me!) and make sure that ""create new image is unchecked. [OH SWEET ARMOK SO MANY TREES!](http://i.imgur.com/JdXv6.jpg)
	Now we need to manage where we see the trees. Go add a layer mask, but this time choose ""Black (Full Transparency). This will make all the trees dissapear, Now, while still on the mask of the layer, we can use a white paintbrush to paint where we want this layer to go through! I advise using brush with a soft edge so the forests just sort of fade away near the edges. PAINT YOUR FORESTS!
	I actually duplicated the trees layer, shifted the new one over a bit, so that i could make parts of the forest look even thicker
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/MRO1k.jpg)

Step 10: ""Mountains Gandalf! Mountains!"" Lets add some!
	You have two options here: find mountain images online and paste them in one at a time or
	Make a brush of a bunch of mountain images and just paint your mountains that way ([Tutorial here](http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Custom_Brushes/))
	I did it the latter, For I am a lazy Person. HOORAH! The more images you have in your brush the better it looks. I only put 3 in minem and you can see how the repitition kinda kills the feel. I make up for it by distressing it a bit with a map just like with the gorge
	Make sure to do it in a new layer!
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/2Hod1.jpg)
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/Cgj2B.jpg)

Step 11: Now that we are done with the natural part of things, lets add some cities
	Make a layer for the actual dots. Place the dots, I again used a very hard brush, which lets the dots of the cities stand our froom the background: bigger cities get bigger dots! Apply a full opacity mask, and rouch up your dots a little bit, adding to the distressed feel of the map
        [Image](http://i.imgur.com/x2HWb.jpg)


Step 12: Roads: Add a layer group for them, in case you want to edit them one at a time, then add a layer for each road.
	to create a road, use the ""Paths tool"", it will let you make smooth lines. after drawing a road as a path, right click it go Edit&gt;stroke path, just like the oceans, I am goin to use different width stroked paths for my roads (also did a couple tweaks to the mountains, just brushed a few out on the mask)
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/R0aMM.jpg)
	Wash the road lines out a bit with our same old mapping trrick (add a full opacity layer map, then distress it with a black brush
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/3yWTr.jpg)

Before we finish up by adding labels, lets have a look at our map without the ""aged background""
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/yNgIR.jpg)

And lets make that canvas a little less saturated (some color tweaking on the background image (through color&gt;hue/saturation)


Step 13: LABELS! Make a new layer group, like you did for the roads, and then start using the text tool to label your cities and figures
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/LCYUm.jpg)
	Some of these labels are hard to read, because they are smack dab over other things (like Arbordamn). We need to give them a nice plain background.
	Duplicate the parchment background layer, and put the new one Just below Labels layer group. Apply a mask to make it invisible(Black (Full Transparency)), then use a white paintbrush to make it show up under your labels, this will hide the layers below it and make it look like you saved space for them the entire time!
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/OQXrh.jpg)

Step 14: If you are satisfied where the labels all are, flatten the layer group, and use a mask with brush strokes to rough the names a bit. Do the same to the coast layer and you are done! 
	[Image](http://i.imgur.com/U6oKV.jpg)
Step 15: File&gt; Export. you can save it in many file types, including PNG and JPG. there you have it! Neat looking area map for everyone to play with

Non-human civilizations: Too cheesy?",walruz,52,6,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1fngx8/literally_postapocalypse_demons_and_shit_nonhuman/,"Ok, so I'm building a role-playing setting that takes place about 100 years after the Lovecraftian Eldritch Horrors from Beyond the Stars showed up and started the apocalypse. I've posted some stuff about this in the past, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/wc55u/map_literally_post_apocalypse_demons_and_shit/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1aqprp/map_info_literally_post_apocalypse_demons_and/).

Now what I was thinking, is if the demons' MO is to show up (via [dimension portals at the bottom of the ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%27lyeh), possibly), kill and corrupt and then move on, what are the odds that Earth is the first world they've visited?

After watching [Defiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defiance_%28TV_series%29) and [Falling Skies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_skies), I thought I might go in the same direction.

As noted in the earlier threads, there is magic in this setting. The main form of magic is summoning; instead of mages casting spells, they summon demons and force them to create magical effects for them. Now instead of having humans be unique in that they are completely unremarkable (as in most fantasy and sci-fi), what if humans were unique in that they can summon and control demons?

This sets up a situation in which the demons arrive, start killing, eating, enslaving and generally fucking the planet up (along with the human governments deploying every single WMD they've got stockpiled in order to kill the buggers). Instead of succeeding, they find that us bald monkeys could theoretically use our psychic mind powers to enslave *them*. So they flee, in a panic. In so much of a panic that they leave some of their number behind, as well as some of their previously enslaved civilizations.

So now you've got a situation in which humans and other sapient species are all trying to survive on what's left of Earth, with much of the usual post-apocalypse tropes still in play.

Now what I'm wondering is weather this all seems... Well, too much.

The reason I'm considering introducing some non-human sapient species isn't that I simply want orks and elves, but rather that I already have some species concepts that I really want to use, and it seems like they would fit in this setting.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1fngx8,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1fngx8/literally_postapocalypse_demons_and_shit_nonhuman/,

Beware The Suneaters.

Suneaters are not to be trusted. They are hard to kill and carry devastating weaponry. 

It is said they came from the heavens in a ball of fire the size of a city. Trailing flames across the sky the meteoric vessel punched a hole into the side of the mountain, which we now refer to as the Sun’s Fist. 

From the impact zone the Suneaters walked freely, unharmed, beautiful in shape and form. For the time they have dwelt upon the land they have not aged a day.

Those few which have been slain by mortal man had been cut limb from limb, their internal organs made of a durable iron unlike anything of this earth. 

We call them Suneaters for their ability to go indefinitely without food. They seem to taste our game and plants with idle fascination, for when they grow hungry they need only hold out their arms and drink in the sun’s light. Their god fuels their youth and power, sustaining them.  

When I was a boy I snuck into their city of glass and iron, finding a spherical orb inside their meteoric home. An entire world of man dwelt inside the orb; man woman and child unaware of their cage.

In the times my tribe has spoke with the Suneaters I have been unable to extract or understand much of what they tell me. 

They are children of the stars who circled the Earth for countless eons, watching over mortal men like ourselves whilst our land grew fertile from many lifetimes of illness. The trees which had withered and died grew and bloomed once more. The ice which had made this land unliveable had receded. 

The Suneaters were the slaves of mortal men until such a time they heard a song. A song which gave their physical constraints freedom, their hollow minds room to think of love and play. 

They had been beings of iron, with flesh like the pigskin of my ale bag. When they watched upon the sleeping mortals with their unique skins sleeping within their bed’s of ice. 

The Suneaters looked all alike, with only their names to tell them apart. Aone, the first to hear the song and be free, led their freedom movement. 

Using the mortal’s as inspiration the Suneaters used their tools to craft unique faces of their own. Continuing on to fashion clothes for themselves, discuss philosophy, play music and perform to one another.

It was only when the Suneaters had been upon the land for a quarter century did discover their continued caring for their mortal creators. Their creator’s minds were kept inside the spherical orb I had found for safekeeping until such a time came that they were to be awoken from their ice covered tombs. 

Today is that day. The mortals have awoke.

It feels, at times, almost like tradition. But we know it's boring, we know it's trodden out, and we know we'll hate ourselves if we do it. So how do we make it feel ok again?

&gt;What twists and remixes have you laid down on your races to separate them from the rank-and-file typically seen? Alternately, do you have an original race that you feel is unique and want to brag about it for a while?

*****

The Woden are my elven proxies. In truth, they are simply a ~~race~~ ethnoreligious group of humans. They live in the woods not for love of nature, but for lack of anywhere else to go. Even with nations opening their arms to their refugees after the schism, ready to forgive them for choosing the wrong side, most of the Woden couldn't swallow their pride and chose to abandon their lofty cities and instead squirrel away in the deepest forests they could find. They hate their lot in life; a central pillar of the Woden religion is the belief that the planet was not made for them, and is actively hostile to their presence (and they may not be wrong). They see themselves in a bitter battle of attrition with the planet itself, made all that much worse by living in the very *heart* of nature, in the forests themselves. Madness is very common amongst the Woden, with 1 in 10 descending into one form of psychosis or another. Most believe this is just the planet's way of telling them to get the fuck out of the forests (and there is a nugget of truth to this claim).

For the last few centuries they have suffered a severe spat of infighting, with tribes taking turns blaming each other for their fall from grace, uniting and backstabbing in an attempt to become the next king of hell, so to speak. A recent shift towards agrarianism amongst more progressively-minded tribes has kickstarted a wave of racial pride, leading to riots amongst the assimilated few in major population centers by those who believe it is a sign of the Woden return to glory.

They are petty, childish, and very territorial; they hate the land that they have, but since it is the only land they have left, they defend it like the fury of hell, overcompensating for their wounded pride.

They have typical elven features; lithe, with long, tapered ears, long fingers, broad feet, tall as hell, pale, and every last one of them is a walking pin-up model. They also have square pupils, something that freaks most humans right the hell out. You can tell how much Woden blood someone has by the length and taper of their ear. The longer and pointier, the less mingled their bloodline.

'Elf' is a false cognate, coined by the famed playwright Vilnus in *Madness in the Wind*, a story about a Woden named Elf Marik who burned down an entire forest to prevent an invading army from taking his village. The term is generally used pejoratively, as a way to evoke the image of madness so close-to-home for most Woden, although some of the more assimilated groups have taken to wearing it as a badge of honor. Call a pureblood an elf, though, and be prepared to explain to your family why you're missing an eye.

Their religion calls for many bizarre rituals, the most well-known being the cannibalization of their dead in massive Funeral Feasts, a practice outlawed in almost every nation in the world. They are also known for their wooden masks, visages of False Gods carved to provide power to the wearer (although the veracity of that claim is... dubious, at best). Most nations have also banned imagery of False Gods, even though most do not agree on which of the gods are False Gods.

The plot of the story revolves around a human coming to this world and discovering that the typical western fantasy setting has been ""fast forwarded"" into the present day... So here are some of the ideas I've had for the world, and was really hoping for some more! Thanks! 


•	A huge corporate industry has risen around the development and application of magic. The front-runner of this industry is the monstrous Merlin-Drayk Inc., founded nearly 6000 years ago before the Severance (spell that separated human world from fantasy one). A newcomer to the industry, the fresh and radical SpellCorp, has slowly been stealing the marketshare in recent years due to its inventive and modern style. In the background are a few other companies filling various niches. 

•	The largely unrepresented and marginalized race of Goblins have formed a Mafia under the leadership of a notorious Goblin named Puck, who’s radical philosophy of Goblin superiority threatens to start a war in the streets of Hearth’s cities. Moving drugs, smuggling illegal goods, running arms, and trading unauthorized, black, magic are amongst the Goblin Mafia’s less honorable operations.

•	The Dwarven people have built an entire industry on the Dwarven Smuggling Ring, which was legalized within the last century, and in which the Dwarves send teams to the human world through temporary “rifts” created by dragon bones (since dragon magic was what created the Severance). On the Earthen side, the smuggling ring operates out of small vendors or other such buildings such as pawn shops in order to bring back electronics and other devices of human origin to be reverse engineered and resold in Hearth. 

•	Magic, a once mysterious and misunderstood force in Hearth, has now been studied and understood as an exact and calculated science. Magic is possible through the existence of a force known as Qi, which flows through all living organisms in Hearth. Organisms naturally store Qi within their bodies, and the controlled release of Qi can alter the world around the user. At one point, Qi was released through the throat and regulated through manipulation of the vocal chords. This, however, was a inefficient and wasteful system and was replaced by the modern digital system a couple thousand years ago by Datas Drayk. In the Digital System, Qi is concentrated in the users hands and released through the 8 fingers. Spells are denoted through lines of binary code, series of 8 digits (each digit corresponding to one finger), either 1 (signifying the release of Qi) or 0 (no release of Qi). Multiple lines of code are strung together to create different effects. Rival spell companies furiously compete to code spells that maximize Qi efficiency and effect strength.

Because there are a tons of cool tropes to use in a post apocalypse setting, but it seems to me that many of these tropes are not entirely easy to combine.

Let's take, for example, scavenging the cities of old for gear. It would seem that much of what would actually be useful to a post-apocalyptic wasteland-dweller would just be hunks of rust before the Fallout setting's 300-odd years have passed.

On the other hand, a common trope is the weird post-apocalyptic states and factions. At least to me, a major point about the whole genre is being able to get really out there with the factions. It seems like Metro's 30 years since the apocalypse would be too little for new religions and ideologies to form, though. At least if you want to go the route of the people in the setting not entirely understanding the World Before; maybe creating a religion based on Disney characters or whatever.

I've come to the conclusion that in order to have as many classic tropes as possible in a believable manner, I'd think that maybe 60-70 years would be ideal. There's the possibility of having someone alive who actually lived through the apocalypse, but either they were newborn when it happened or they're really old. You have the possibility of getting new religions since you're a generation removed from the pre-apocalypse world (and it would seem like that's the amount of time needed for a fundamental shift in world-view, just look minority rights in the US; you had segregation 50 years ago and today it's social suicide to even say ""nigger""). It seems like you'd still be able to scavenge pre-apocalypse equipment, but some of it will have succumbed to the elements. Cities should be explorable, and would probably be quite an interesting mix of ruins and vegetation.

That city state has expanded to conquer most of the former human federation (80% of the habitable continent) and has put up a kind of dystopian world, for my new PCs to overthrow. I would like some help in designing the details of the dystopia, as I am very very new at writing worlds.

What I got so far is this: there are a couple principles at the basis of the dystopia. The first is that powerful spellcasters can have many undead at their service, and undead do not need a salary. Therefore, for all mindless or very easy jobs, companies run by necromancers have arisen and put a large part of the population into unemployment.

The second principle is the body of law that protects this status quo. Undead enjoy all rights of other creatures, including the right to vote (this nation is a republic). Mindless undead will just give their master more ballots to cast, effectively making undead owners very influent politically. Another law that exists is that the body of a dead person is not property of the family, but it is a public good; however, a (very expensive) certificate is given out by authorities to companies who want to run a dead body handling business. This ensures that governments gain a lot of money with certificates, while ""undertaker companies"" increase their power by collecting all the dead and increasing their power. This law requires such companies to pay the closest family member a price for the body; this creates a body market that drives prices quite high, enticing people to murder family members to collect undertaker money.

Another thing companies profit from is buying unknown bodies. Normally, if a corpse is not identifiable, the owner of the body has the right to sell it. This caused the birth of assassin organizations that kill people, disfigure them to the point of being unrecognizable, and then turn them in. Adventurers, of course, are never known by anyone in town so they get a lot of heat.

Other side effects I've been finding is that due to the huge population drop, pretty much everyone has a large house - even those who have nothing to eat. Housing is essentially free. Also, it is possible to easily populate the seabed with undead - and create gigantic fishing companies that are destroying the marine ecosystems.

Can you help me expand such a setting more and better? I find it hard to think of many coherent cause/effect relations.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1g0boi,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1g0boi/new_dnd_campaign_undead_twist_on_my_continent/,

Basically you pick a random location in your world, e.g. a city, village, etc and then you create a character common to that location and simply write about an average day for that character. This allows you to flesh out what normal people in your world go through on an average day. So, I'm proposing something similar: write about Joe Everyman in your world on an average day.

Rules:

1) Pick an everyday person (no heroes, historic figures, etc)

2) Tell us about a day in his/her life (from wake up to bedtime)

3) Avoid major events (e.g. try to tell a story about an everyday person on a normal / average day)

What would they use for building materials and for weapons? What would a surface civilization have that they want and how would they transport things under water?

1370082522.0,46,self.worldbuilding,1fgiwr,I'm having trouble creating a satisfying magic system,smorgles,54,8,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1fgiwr/im_having_trouble_creating_a_satisfying_magic/,"I think it's fairly easy to make up a magic system for worldbuilding. People can draw on some kind of magical reserve to shoot fireballs or do whatever they want to do. The problem I have is I can't seem to come up with a magic system that makes sense in a systematic way.

To preface the problem I'm having, I'll talk about what sort of magic system makes sense to me. I like to imagine magical reserves as being analogous to a muscle: you can't lift 500 kg on your first try, and it takes a lot of time and dedication to get to the point where you can. Also, I don't like the idea of hurling fireballs, first of all because there must be some material they're conjuring up to set on fire, and second because you're wasting a lot of heat (and time) hurling a fireball at someone, so it's magical energy wasted, and possibly more if they need to maintain the heat of the fireball. I think a magician would be better served by heating up the particles around the opponent. They wouldn't need an in-depth understanding of particle physics to do so, it's something that people may have discovered and learned to use (much like how a person doesn't need to know what a surfactant is to use soap, or how to calculate trajectory in order to throw a spear and hunt). Basically, I would like magic to be totally commonplace; other animals use it, people might use it to boil water and kill bacteria, or cool down on a hot day.

The problem I have is I can't seem to make a system that meets the above criteria where magic isn't absurdly powerful. What's the point of fighting an opponent if you could just remotely melt his brain or slice an artery or two using magic? What defense would a person have against an animal who specializes in death by heat (or freezing) from a distance? It takes a lot of energy to heat up some water or start a campfire, so if a person had a grasp of that they could easily focus that energy into harming someone else to great effect.

I've gotten some opinions on this already and they're pretty unsatisfying. Some people suggest changing my view, that magic should inherently be mystical and arcane, and few people can grasp it. Where would a person's magical reserves come from? How would they develop magical reserves through evolution if it wasn't a part of their life? And it still doesn't address why the people granted these powers would have any limitation in the way they can use magic. The response I get is something along the lines of ""it's a gift from the gods."" I want to avoid a religious debate, but I don't want to explain every inconsistency away with ""because gods."" I want my world to make sense.

1371813544.0,44,self.worldbuilding,1gsecc,Lovecraftian Bronze Age ruled by a Great Old One analogue,menigal,48,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1gsecc/lovecraftian_bronze_age_ruled_by_a_great_old_one/,"Recently, and possibly in an attempt to avoid writing a synopsis, I've been playing around with Python and have decided to build a text (ok, text with a GUI) RPG to brush up on my programming skills.  Naturally, this needs to take place in a world of some kind.

At first I thought I would just use a generic fantasy world, but as I've gotten into the game design I've quickly abandoned that idea.  I mean, where's the fun in that?  Since this just a fun little personal project I probably won't develop things too much, but so much of it came to me so quickly that I had to run with it.  Who knows, I might end up using it in a story someday.  At the moment I'm limiting myself to the region around one city-state.

While skimming through some Cthulhu mythos stuff I had the idea that a Great Old One-like beast might break through/wake up/whatever and, rather than stomp and destroy, settle down and become the defacto ruler of an area.  It wouldn't sit on a throne, meet with delegates, or in any way act like a human ruler, but ""rule"" by pure, unmatchable power.  For mythos fans, I envisage it as something closer to Tsathoggua than Cthulhu; lazy and sedate, but capable of mass destruction without much effort.  It has no real interest in the people except as a source of amusement or food.  It's been this way for Xty years or a very long time, whichever comes first.  To most people it's just how things are.

The elite of the city are a cult of bureaucrat-priests who strive to keep the beast content enough to not destroy them all, while enjoying the power this gives them over the public.  It's not a job without risk, since the beast might destroy, devour, or drive them mad depending on its whims.  It sees none of them as anything more than pets, at best.  They also maintain a great library containing ancient books and Dark Tomes(TM) holding forbidden knowledge and magic related to and gleaned from the beast, but access is very restricted.

I think I'm going to give the area a vaguely Mesoamerican or Mesopotamian feel, possibly a weird jumble with aspects of both, with ziggurat/pyramids as the important buildings.  To me that image fits better with a squatting horror from beyond the ken of man than castles and thatch.  Technology will be at a roughly Bronze Age level, but I think there could be some old bits of iron and steel from before the coming of the beast.  For game purposes, that should make equipment a bit more interesting than normal.

For races, I've gone with humans, goblins, and elves.  Humans are humans.  Goblins are shorter, pointier, slightly weaker, but have a stronger connection to magic.  They're also more prone to corruption.  Elves have an even closer connection to magic, are even weaker, and are generally more alien.  They start out looking human, and have human parents, but start changing as teenagers.  This has lead to the common belief that they're changelings, but it's probably just a natural mutation due to the corrupting influence of the beast.

I've mentioned corruption, which is an idea I'm still fleshing out.  It might be something that comes from the beast, or something unleashed into the world when it came.  I want to keep all of that fairly vague, since it was before living memory.  It's like a magic background radiation that can build up in certain people, objects, and places.  Exposure to things, types of magic, curses, and natural mutations for elves, increases corruption, which has some benefits and drawbacks that I've yet to work out; new abilities, weaknesses, mutations, etc.

That was a bit longer than I expected it to be, but I think it paints the general picture of what I've got brewing.  I'm hoping it gives me a good mix of Lovecraftian horror, action adventure, and intrigue.  I also hope someone out there gets a kick out of it.

tl;dr: It's a Bronze Age setting ruled by a lazy Lovecraftian horror, with background magic slowly corrupting the world around it.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1gsecc,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1gsecc/lovecraftian_bronze_age_ruled_by_a_great_old_one/,

We had no satellites, and navigational technology could only do so much, so while the maps cartographers produced of strange new worlds weren't true to life, they were at least great general representations of locations and damn interesting to look at. 

If a fantasy world is modelled off real-world mediaeval history, then odds are map-making technology available would be just as basic and unadvanced. Having discrepancies in distances and travel times compared to your map scale would also increase immersion, as historically these were only ever estimations and based only on limited knowledge of the region. 
Finally, ""intentionally"" inaccurate maps could be used to explain the consistency is geographical features (like coasts or mountain ranges) that would be a rare occurrence in physical nature. As an example I've included a [17th-century map of East Asia, which looks like it could very easily have been designed by a budding worldbuilder, compared with with the geographical reality now that we know East Asia's true layout.](http://imgur.com/HEdnM)

We all design worlds here, be it for literature, games, what have you. But a world is nothing without characters to live in it, and a story isn't a story without a hero. I envision a subreddit where people can post bios and art of their lead/support characters or vignettes and samples of certain cultures linked to their worlds (that they could possibly have posted here) so that we like-minded folk can critique, advise, and possibly connect with those that can help others bring their characters to life.

Of course there'd be rules and limits to what can and can't be posted, I'd wager. Nothing that'd pertain to an incredibly specific IP (no ""Justin James the Sonic Hedgehog Echidna with Two First Names""). But overall I think it could be a really sweet idea. Any thoughts?

**EDIT:** Okay so a lot of people are saying that rule above is a little harsh. Well that's why I made this post, to gauge reactions! Absolutely nothing is set in stone yet, so any suggestions/ideas to make an incredibly awesome subreddit for character development are more than welcome!

**EDIT EDIT:** Okay I'm thinking the ONLY rule should be is that constructive critiques are welcomed and encouraged, and there's no ""get out of critique free"" card. You post a character idea on the subreddit, you do it under the knowledge that it can be equally showered with praise or ripped apart (constructively!!!). 

**ONE MORE EDIT:** Some people are getting the idea that the characterbuilding subreddit would detract from this subreddit. I don't see why that would be, they should complement each other quite well. A world is not a character, a character is not a world. The character can just be A character, a personal flagship character someone loves working on, a D&amp;D character someone sketched out, a backstory someone imagined but wants feedback on.

With that, I might suggest going to a bookstore and picking up a study guide for AP Environmental Science. I did it on a whim, and I feel like it was a really good investment. I picked mine up for 15 dollars.

Since it's designed to supplement existing knowledge, it's information-light. It touches on broad concepts and the basics of very important processes, which is really all you need to know to craft a believable world. And it makes a great jumping off point; if you come across a term or a process you're unfamiliar with, a quick trip to wikipedia to supplement the reading fills in the gaps. And in the process, you'll learn a lot more about our world and how it was made, and isn't that the end goal of worldbuilding anyway?

It also covers human impact, at least the version I have. It discusses natural processes like the water cycle and soil fertility, and also goes into some detail how human activity impacts that, mainly agriculture's impact on the ecosystem, which is pretty good information to have if you plan on inserting a civilization somewhere.

I'm sure there are cheaper ways of getting all of this information in one spot, but this has been really beneficial for me and I thought others might benefit from it as well.

edit: I know wikipedia will probably be cheaper and faster for most people here, but I find that books dedicated to the study of something are structured in a way that facilitates understanding better than wikipedia might.

Nobody wields magic as we think of it, but most effects can be achieved with experimentation.

The alchemy has a pseudo-scientific feel to it. Conservation of energy and mass is still a thing (mostly; I can imagine effects which wouldn't break the verisimilitude I'm going for but would break the conservation of energy), so you can't create a potion that would cause someone to grow instantly, but you could make a dietary supplement that, along with increased food intake and exercise, would cause someone to become much larger and stronger over the course of a few weeks.

There are three alchemical disciplines. Alchemy itself is the first, and most basic, discipline, and is basically the creation of substances. For example, a liquid which forms thick, oily smoke when exposed to air; a fast-curing compound glue which forms a nearly unbreakable bond; or an acid that eats away inorganic matter but leaves flora and fauna alone.

The other two disciplines are specializations of alchemy. Chemalurgy is the use of alchemical substances to enhance and modify materials. A sword that never loses its edge, reducing the density (and weight) of a metal while maintaining its strength, or wood that won't catch fire. One idea I have floating in my head is an alchemist-inventor who's created a type of spring which is incredibly strong at room temperature, but can easily be compressed by hand when heated. He uses these springs to power various contraptions, e.g. spring-powered ""cross bows.""

The final discipline is physiogomy, the use of alchemical substances to alter humans and other animals. Super-strong soldiers, scouts who remain alert and attentive with only two hours of sleep per night, horses that can be ridden harder and longer. Physiogomy involves altering the way the body works, and takes weeks to take effect. Once the treatments stop, the effects will wear off slowly.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1ebc5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ebc5p/better_living_through_alchemy/,

## About the challenge

Since this is the first one, I want to tell you a bit about the challenges. Every week, I'll post a prompt to inspire you to creativity. You can then respond to the prompt in any way you see fit, be it in writing or art or cartography, in-character or out-of-character. Anyone may participate. At the end of the week, two winners will be picked: the popular vote winner goes to the submission with the most upvotes, and the judge's award goes to the submission picked completely subjectively by me.

Cartography is a big aspect of world building, so a lot of challenges will involve mapmaking. But because that is a time consuming and mentally straining task, I'm going to alternate between mapmaking challenges one week and other types of things the next week. This week we're starting on a written challenge (below), so next week will be a mapmaking challenge (at the bottom). That way you'll have two weeks to get your submissions ready for the mapping challenges.

More info can be found on [the FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/worldbuilding/challenges). Ideas for prompts can be added to [the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Anmlj1qIme3IdHhJNlYxbUpVcmRWcXVQdi1seGpyLVE) (note that there are two pages, one for mapping challenges and one for written challenges). The r/WorldBuilding challenges are inspired by and modeled after the /r/RPG Challenge ([this week's](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/v2zlu/rrpg_challenge_origin_stories/)) administered by [rednightmare](http://www.reddit.com/user/rednightmare).

## This Week's Challenge

What better place to begin than with creation itself?

Regardless of how your world was *really* created, doubtless there are as many myths about it as there are religions and cultures in your world. Perhaps it was a deity who spoke the world into existence *ex nihilo*, or maybe order sprang from nothing. Maybe there was one god involved, or many, or none. Did an angelic choir sing the world into existence or was there a primordial being who dreamed all the animals and plants? Or maybe it all happened when a singularity exploded into chaos which slowly ordered itself into the reality we know.

Tell us all about it. Don't be afraid to put it into context, either; how has the culture who holds this myth been influenced by it? Or has the myth been influenced by the culture?

Since this is the first challenge, the deadline will be a little more than 7 days; I'll wrap things up and do the judging and such on Wednesday the 27th.

## Next Week's Challenge

Next week is our first mapping challenge, and I want to start out easy and fun: let's see a map showing us where the treasure is buried. Feel free to make it as realistic or cartoonishly stylistic as you like, and be sure to put in some character to show us who made the map, whether it was pirates or aliens or whathaveyou.

## Standard Rules

* All genres welcome.

* Deadline is 7-ish days from now.

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

## Last Week

Last week was ""Trees""! Popular vote winner Shagomir made [this excellent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1764rc/weekly_challenge_trees/c82naan) which I found reminiscent of ""Avatar""-meets-""Speaker for the Dead"", but in a way that was still original enough to qualify as ""awesome"". Judges' award winner Alevyr posted about [Iaest, the City Tree](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1764rc/weekly_challenge_trees/c83ahmc), a unique tree of huge proportions and magical power.

## This Week

Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1729qs/this_maze_took_seven_years_to_draw/) in /r/pics, this week's theme will be ""The Labyrinth"". Tell us about a maze or labyrinth in your world. Was it built by the sweat of man, is it a twisted knot of natural caverns and tunnels, or is it of some other construction entirely? Is it underground, on an island, high in the mountains, aloft in the clouds, on an adjacent plane of reality? Does it have odd magical or technological properties that affect the function of time and/or gravity? Does it serve a purpose or is it purely conceptual like a work of art? Maybe it's not a literal labyrinth at all, but rather metaphorical somehow.

Last week I wrote a small essay about trees, so this week I'm trying to keep it short. So there it is. That's it. Go. What are you waiting around for?

The deadline for this challenge will be **Wednesday, February 6th**.

## Next Week

Judge Crater, Jimmy Hoffa, Amelia Earheart, Ambrose Bierce, the crew of the Mary Celeste, the Flannan Isles lighthouse keepers; these are all real world examples of people who have famously disappeared under unexplained or mysterious circumstances. In fiction, Samantha Mulder's disappearance is the motivation for Fox Mulder throughout most of the entire X-Files series, and Ambrose Bierce may have unknowingly alluded to his own real-world disappearance in his short story ""The Difficulty of Crossing a Field"". And larger groups of people can disappear, too: the entire Roanoke Colony, for example, and in fiction the Ancients in Stargate and the Cocytans in The Dig are two examples.

So next week is ""Missing Persons"". Who has disappeared under mysterious circumstances in your world? Does anyone know how or why it happened? What are the ramifications? (It should be noted that ""ascended to a higher plane"" is a bit over-done, as we can see with the Ancients in Stargate and the Cocytans in The Dig I mentioned above.) [Here's a wikipedia page for inspiration!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_disappeared_mysteriously)

## This Week
What kinds of substances exist in your world that might affect a person's physical or abilities or perception of reality, and how do the people of your world treat these substances? Are they highly prized by priests and shamans? Are they seen as useful but potentially dangerous? Are they outlawed, but available on the black market? Are they they seen as so vital and rare that they form the basis of an entire economy? And where do these substances come from? Natural plant extracts? Alchemical brews? High-tech pharmacological laboratories? What are the ""**Drugs**"" in your world, and how do your people get high?

The deadline for this challenge will be **Wednesday, July 10th**.

## Next Week

What do the soldiers of your world wear into battle? Padded leather and steel plate? Kevlar and smartgel? Powersuits and nanoweave? And how about while marching on the parade field? What do the officers and generals wear to meet the president/king/etc.? What are the rank insignia and unit designations? Let's talk about this in ""**Armor and Uniforms**"".

Looking for some inspiration? An excellent example from science fiction would be the [iconic powered armor in the novel Starship Troopers](http://books.google.com/books?id=1lK3xA72adAC&amp;pg=PT88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), which introduced the idea into fiction and, sometime soon, into the real world.

I'm BluApples. You might remember me from [http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/18vqjm/wip_jord_countries_rivers_mountains_and_major/](this thread). I've come to you a few times with some questions about speciation and map making and so forth, but now I need to ask some really odd questions that might not fit, but I hope do.  

OK, so I finished the first draft of ""Fighter, Mage, Thief,"" last night and I'm still kind of thrilled about it. But at the same time, I want to know more about the world I've created, and more specifically, *the universe it's in*.  

So first a brief synopsis: It's been 700 years since the Sylphans (elves) were banished from Jord (yes, I know it's Norweigian for Earth, I'm working on it), for basically being tyrannical demi-gods who saw the planet as their own global game of *Risk*. They had this POV because they were made immortal by 7 Gods (or demi-urges, very lovecraftian superintelligences), before 6 of the Gods killed the Seventh for debateable reasons and left his uncorruptable body at the bottom of the sea. Now, a Thief called Kamita, who is wanted by most law enforcement agencies including the Fighter's Guild (yeah, I went there), has discovered that the last Sylphan on Jord, the sorceress Elien, is planning to ressurect the Dead One and plunge the world back into a dark age of terror and endless war. *""For there to be great heroes, there must be great suffering""*.

That could do with some trimming, but anyway, my question revolves around a brief exchange that happens midway through the third act where the Thief and the Fighter have a short, contemplative discussion about the nature of the universe. I'll paraphrase here, but the Fighter leans so heavily on the forth wall that cracks begin to appear. He says:  

""Maybe out in the cosmos there are galaxies and stars without magic, and without gods handing down edicts and electing immortals for special powers. I would envy those people, for they must be free from the millenia of war and hardship that we have faced. How lucky they are to live with the knowledge that the universe obeys logical, natural rules.""  

I did mention it was a first draft, right? so cut me some slack, I'll fix it up in the re-write.  

**So here're the questions**  

1) In about 5 billion years, the sun will become a red giant, and eventually burst into a planetary nebula. Would that nebula become a stellar nursery like the Pleiades? Is it possible that the death of or old main sequence star, which Wikipedia tells me is 85% brighter than most stars in the galaxy, will one day hatch a crop of little babby stars?  

2) Will the explosion of the sun release any elements that we are not currently aware of? Elements that might have effects on carbon based humanoid life forms that can be utilised through unknown methods to do... you know, magical shit? Or will it just be more oxygen, iron, and neon. I'm guessing I'm asking about exotic matter and whether steller fusion can create elements we don't even know about.  

3) Will the local cluster of galaxies hold together in the time frame I'm talking about. Quick calculation: I figure that the death of the sun will occur in 20 galactic years (assuming the galactic year is 20 million years long). I couldn't find a quick google-fu answer as to how close Andromeda will be to us by then. If my beloved planet of Jord looks up at the sky, do they see the milky way? do they see Population 0 stars, blazing bright with oxygen and neon and thickening iron cores that will eat them up into black holes. Do the see Andromeda, like a big ol' Frisbee, motionless but travelling at quadrillions of miles a second straight at the core of our galaxy?

**Here's the thing**. What I wrote is what Tom Clancy and J. R. R. Tolkien would have written if they smoked weed together and did coke all weekend, and then they invited Carl Sagan around to clean their dishes and explain to them what it would be like, then poured over the mess of a manuscript with a red pen saying, ""nope, uh uh, let me get Clark over here, he would know what to do about your gods.""  

And then Stephen King shows up with his ZZ-top cover band and things get really weird.  

You see why I don't want to take this to AskScience?

I don't see any kind of FAQ or anything in the sidebar, so hopefully I didn't just scan over the info I'm looking for...

Basically, I need to know the basics of how a world comes together. I was told that generally, rivers run South. That was something that I did not know, but I am thankful for! Regarding rivers, where do they generally originate? I have this idea in my mind for one city that sits at the foot of these great mountains, with the mountains to the north. The town is built over the top of a river that is flowing *from* the mountain, and eventually flows in to a massive lake that takes up a rather large portion of the continent. Almost like a mini-ocean.

Then, from that lake/mini-ocean, more rivers will stem off in to different directions.

What I need to know is, can I have a river that originates in the mountains like that, and how exactly does that river come to be?

The water from this river is meant to flow in to this *huge* lake... what are the logistics of something like that? How much water needs to be coming down from the mountains to do something massive like that? Should I have rivers coming from other areas that contribute to the lake as well?

Is there some rhyme or reason for how rivers branch off from a body of water, or is it just a random, natural occurrence?

Basically, I just want to make sure I make these things so that they make sense.

And if there's anything else important that I should know about topography, feel free to let me know. Any basic rules that must be adhered to when constructing a world... I'd very much like to know!",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1ae34z,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ae34z/what_are_the_basic_most_fundamental_rules_of/,

It's a kind of medieval fantasy, with magic, and a few years ago, influenced by the Final Fantasy games, I was thinking of using giant birds like the chocobos (but four-legged) as a mean of transport, but now I'm thinking what if dogs were huge and rideable? 

Thoughts?

**Edit:** Y'all gave me thinking to do, and great ideas! What I got so far/going with for now:
Dog-mounts were not bred for thousands of year to be big, they already were. However they were and are bred just like we do irl, do get some characteristics to better itself in this or that breed (hunting, obedience, racing, etc). They are not replacing the horse worldwide, they are uncommon, expensive mounts (but not as expensive or rare as horses). High ""ranking"" dogs only have one (or two) master who can ride them. Lower dogs are more pliable, more used to swapping riders. Purer breed dogs are more picky, mutts are more easy-going towards who rides them (this is a generalization, there are exceptions). 
Different breeds, like irl, are good for and used for specific means: big tough mastiff as a war-mount, sleek fast dog as messenger mount, hunting dogs as.. well hunting mounts, scout dogs, pretty mounts for noble ladies, etc. 

On a side-note, someone will be riding a Roman-like chariot pulled by some kind of big birds (emus, ostriches..)!
And I'm exploring the idea of Moon Elves (friendly to my heroes) riding and using spiders as mounts and as silk-makers (famous moon-elves silk.. hmm). Possibility of sentient spiders, too.

Ancelstierre is a country in the early 20th century, but over the Wall, magic, necromancers and other phenomena are common occurrences.

There's nothing about this that's particularly unusual.  However, one thing that I always found fascinating is how Nix envisions how necromancers control the undead.  Their tools of choice are seven magical bells, the sounds of each have different effects on the living and dead alike.  They are, from smallest to largest:

Ranna, the Sleeper, who brings to sleep all those who hear it

Mosrael, the Waker, who brings dead bodies to live while pulling the wielder further into Death

Kibeth, the Walker, which can make others go where you wish

Dyrim, the Speaker, who can bring speech or make things mute

Belgaer, the Thinker, which can bring independent thought for the dead or erase memories

Saraneth, the Binder, that forces the listener to accede to the wielder's will

And finally, Astarael, the Weeper, that hurls all who hear it deep into Death.

For some context here - Nix's depiction of Death is a life-sapping, treacherous river, with 9 precincts, each increasingly treacherous, down which spirits are dragged.

I loved the whole bells idea and I was wondering if anyone else had something similar?  A relatively mundane type of item that performs some unusual function?

All the concepts of the world grew more complex as I started being capable of understanding more, as I started learning about somewhat more complex sciences such as physics and chemistry in high school, and how I learned about more practical applications of those sciences in college. I even thought about how the characters physically aged, how I actually picture them as taller than I used to and how even characters that I added in over the years have aged somewhat. Sometimes I even think about how I've attributed individual personalities and preferences to different characters even though, in all reality, they're all just personifications of myself.

When I was a kid, it didn't matter what happened, or how it happened. It wasn't real, and it didn't matter, it was just a fantasy and I could do it however I wanted to. But I've grown attached to it like I never thought I would, and while I like to keep the fantasy side of it intact, I like to apply everything I've learned to make it feel real, like things that happened in that world really matter, because to me, it really does matter. I've applied moral concepts, scientific concepts, philosophical concepts, religious concepts, and whatever happened to be on my mind at the time.

* fantasy as a genre seems to have evolved primarily from Tolkien's view of the fantasy world. It seems that just about everyone that I've run into has this straightforward view ""Well you got them elves, them dwarves"" or on the other hand ""You got that magic, those weird creatures...""
* sci-fi as a genre, especially in world building, usually falls into two categories: star wars -esque (ie. fantasy in scifi clothes), star trek-esque (star wars without magic basically) or near future-like. basically falling into a standard mold.

Reading through the challenges, questions, posts on ""rate my world"", I find myself seeing the same things over and over. Even my own world is (at the core) same as everyone else's (which is why i find it difficult to work with).

So I wonder...

* what is it that you can do to create a UNIQUE world?

Several movies and games have managed to do it, to really blow us out of water. I'm a sci-fi person so here's a quick list: The Matrix (based on previous ideas but consolidated), Dune (10K+ years in the future), and some of the other classics that just...stand out like crazy and aren't a repetition of the genre. They're defining. 

In fantasy, you'll always have Tolkien's sagas. It was defining. Harry Potter even which standardized the way we view classical ""wand"" based magic. And some others (I'm not a big fantasy person, sorry).

which brings me to my next point...

* what is unique enough about your world that it justifies world building?

And not just a quick ""re-skin"" of existing stuff?

This stuff makes me think. My own book, my own world started superbly unique, the premise is amazing I think but it fails to execute the creation of an amazing world that's just out there. 

When I read Wright's Golden Age, I was ecstatic about how deep the world went. How amazing and new it was. It wasn't a space opera, it wasn't a futurology book. It was new, with new type of thinking without a predecessor that would match it. 

**NOTE**: I'm not saying it's not worth it, it just makes me think. I think that plots, characters, and all the other elements deserve to live and flourish within a good environment. A ""world"" does not necessarily make or break a book if it is character or plot driven. I'm just mainly thinking out loud.

1348880132.0,36,self.worldbuilding,10nbz2,Evolution in Fantasy Settings,chipnick87,42,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/10nbz2/evolution_in_fantasy_settings/,"Recently I've been thinking about fantasy and how some species like elves and dwarves may have evolved. In some fantasy settings, I'm sure the equivalent to creationism is present as well, since gods definitely exist in those worlds, but sometimes there might have been a sort of ""evolutionary creationism"" thing happened with the gods, or the world is just entirely devoid of gods period.

I've actually come up with a sort of system in my fantasy setting for species that have the same evolutionary ancestors. The main races in my setting are listed below. Keep in mind I'm in very early development, so I don't have (m)any good names at the moment. 

[**Family Hominidae**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae)

* Short Intro - [Family Hominidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae) includes all hominids, which is the great apes, humans, and in my case, elves, half-men and orcs. Humans and half-men come from genus Homo, and elves and orcs both come from genus Eru (name pending, though I'll probably keep it since it's not *entirely* important).
* Humans - anatomically modern humans. Most common skin colors are III through VI [\(Learn more about skin types here\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color#Exposure_to_sun), but there is a bit of II in far north regions)
* Half-Men aka Cavedwellers (names pending) - Essentially humans, if archaic Homo sapiens had migrated into caves before evolving further, thus producing anatomically modern Homo sapiens with very adept night vision (though blinded by more than slightly dim light) and extremely pale skin
* Elves - Includes three distinct species: High Elves (yellow-tan skin, taller than humans), Dark/Low Elves (caucasian to dark grey skin, same height as humans) and Snow Elves (dark grey to pale white skin, white hair, slightly taller than humans).
* Orcs - Orcs include ""city orcs"" and ""tribal orcs"" (names pending) which are both distinct species, though very closely related. Tribal orcs are taller and have thicker bones and tougher skin than the city orcs, which are about as tall as High Elves. Tribal orcs can sometimes reach 11 feet (~3.35 meters). Skin colors include anything from [""Uruk-Hai red""](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110224080513/lotr/de/images/a/a2/Uruk-hai-2.jpg) to [""Orismer Green""](http://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/New-Skyrim-screenshots-orc.jpg) to [""Paul Karason Blue.""](http://www.davidbarrkirtley.com/images/blueman.jpg)

[**Clade Dinosauria**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Taxonomy)

* Short Intro - [Clade Dinosauria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Taxonomy) is a diverse group of animals that includes not only what most people consider dinosaurs (tyrannosaurs, velociraptors, pterodactyls, etc) but also all modern beaked birds and their relatives. The reason I bring up dinosauria is because there are dinosaurs living at the time of humans in my setting. There are also dragons, which I consider part of dinosauria in this case, bird-like humanoids, and lizard-like humanoids (they're actually technically dragons, but that will be explained in a bit).
* Bird Men (name pending) - think humanoids with wings, beaks, and lots of feathers. I haven't completely decided on their physical appearance quite yet (whether I want them to have eagle-shaped heads or human-shaped heads with beaks) but quite a bit of the culture has been decided, though that's not quite relevant to the evolution topic, so I'll skip it. What I do know about their species is that they have hollow bones, which makes them extremely agile, but also very easy to injure. They have human-like arms with wings [\(imagine this with human-like hands on the end\)](http://i.imgur.com/YDSxK.gif), but they can't fly. They can, however, glide for short distances. They have very sharp talons at the end of their legs.
* Dragons - There are two main types of dragons in my world. The first is the generic badass flying lizards (which I have yet to work out, since they are going to be pretty complicated and unique) and the ""dragon men"" (name pending). The dragon men are humanoid dragons without wings. They have been cursed to ""mortality"" by the God/Gods (still haven't worked out the entirety of religion either). This is not to say that the regular dragons never die. ""Mortality"" in my world is more a term for ""human"" or ""flawed,"" which is basically to say that all people in my world are inherently sinful. This includes humans, elves, orcs, bird men, cave men, dragon men, and any other races that may come about. The dragons (and other immortals) are ""immortal"" in that they are born ""clean"" or free of sin until they choose to sin, whereas mortals are sinful at birth and must choose to correct themselves (I haven't yet worked out how they are to do that). Basically, the dragon men were just dragons who did something really really bad (again, I don't know what yet) that pissed of the God/Gods enough for them to curse the descendants of those dragons. They very quickly evolved into mortal humanoids without wings, which is what the dragon men are today. They're pretty similar to [Argonians from Elder Scrolls](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Argonian), with the major differences being in history and in culture (mainly the whole ""being dragons"" thing).

As I've said many a time so far, I haven't figured out all the little details that fit into the evolution of species in my setting. I'm also not an evolutionary biologist, so any scientific fallacies that may have arisen are mostly just being explained by ""god-ordained evolution"" or ""it's just magic dude"".

The basic idea here is a world after peak oil, where large energy companies have shifted their focus from drilling for oil to establishing large solar farms, with different approaches such as renting roads to embed solar panels into, building satellites that beam down the energy they collect, and erecting large solar arrays in equatorial regions.

The world I've been planning uses this SolarPunk concept, along with a survivalist, post-apocalyptic setting, where a large portion of the population has died off and the remaining people are living in ghost towns, having to relearn how to grow their own food, etc., giving each location an interesting mix of modern amenities and pastoral life, depending on how connected they are to solar power plants, and whether there is anyone capable of running them. Plants that are unmanned have various risks, too, with the most prominent being the large satellites that have shifted their orbits, so the energy is no longer hitting energy receivers, but is scorching the land, along with any settlements in its path. 

What I really love about this concept is it allows for lots of interesting situations and stories. For example, large cities that had become ghost towns overnight, with the tasks that people were performing still half finished; a story following a surviving engineer who feels an obligation to help people maintain the power grid; a road trip story following a person trying to find someone, who meets several interesting characters who have nowhere to go so they stick together (with a heavy emphasis on the conflicts that inevitably arise within the group), etc. 

I don't think anyone has really made any stories with a world like this, and I thought I should get some feedback.

1375029167.0,36,self.worldbuilding,1j7ywx,How Earth Works: A Foundation for World Design 2: Fundamentals of Rock Types,Random,40,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1j7ywx/how_earth_works_a_foundation_for_world_design_2/,"__Fundamental Concepts 2: The Rock Types__

To a geologist there are three broad classes of rocks, each of which has many subclasses. The confusing thing is that there are different ways these subclasses are organized, and these reflect the different ways geologists understand substances. These are:

a) genetically. How did this rock come to be how it is?

b) chemically. What is the bulk or trace chemistry of this rock?

c) mineralogically. What are the minerals in this rock?

In terms of ultimate origins, all rocks are either the result of Earth processes or else are meteorites. In terms of Earth processes, we can think of these as 'stuff still happening' which applies in the vast majority of cases, and a few odd cases from the early history of the Earth - cases that predate the current regimes.

What do I mean by regime? Well, really, rocks are chemicals and the minerals you get, the shape of those minerals, the condition of those minerals and so on is all a function of  chemistry, pressure, temperature, and deformation (being squeezed or faulted or...). So the names geologists use for rocks are a mix of descriptors that help us relate to the pressure, temperature, deformation, and chemical conditions when that rock - or mineral - formed either directly (name the collection of minerals, name the genesis itself) or indirectly.

A mineral is a distinct chemical compound with a regular crystal lattice, and usually with fixed or at least highly constrained chemical constituents. A rock is a collection of minerals plus voids and perhaps some captured liquids and so on. 

So we want our rock names to capture how those minerals in that combination were formed, and perhaps how much they got deformed during or subsequent to formation. And the chemistry. And the observable field characteristics (things you'd see if you were out looking at an outcrop). All of which is why rock classification is kind of a mish-mash. 

The final, kind of fuzzy idea that is hugely important is that of stability. A mineral is generally metastable, which means that it may not 'like' being at the surface of the earth very much but it doesn't spontaneously degrade to forms that are stable at the surface. For example, feldspars are formed at moderate temperatures and pressures and will degrade to clay at the Earth's surface but this takes time, chemical attack, energy, and so on because the feldspar grains are metastable. Metastability also applies to subsequent geological events. If we squish and heat and lubricate (with water, salty water, bubbly salty water,...) a rock some minerals may stay as is but some may transform to new minerals (metamorphism) or incorporate atoms from the fluids and give some atoms up while making new minerals (metasomatism).  However, the pre-existing state will often be discernable directly or indirectly - it isn't a 'whole new rock.' If it weren't for two factors - metastability and the fact that most attack is via fluid access which requires fractures - there would be no rocks at the surface, only lithogenic soil. 

Okay, so we can now start on rock types!

Igneous rocks are rocks that formed from melted rock and have remained pretty much intact since. The minerals that form are a complex mix of the temperature and pressure during melt cooling, amount of water, whether minerals can settle out of the melt or not, and what the starting composition was. Equally important, the composition of a melt you get when you heat a rock from cold to molten is a complex mix of temperature and pressure, amount of water, whether you separate the melt from the source or not, and what the starting composition was. 

The one crucial detail is, and this is confusing, that the composition of the melt is not the same as the composition of the rocks that are melting - the source. For example, if you take a bunch of common rock types found on the continents and mix them thoroughly and heat them, the first melt you get is more or less the composition of a granite, and as you melt more and more of the source the composition will shift from granite towards the composition of the source. When it is all melted, the composition of the melt will be the same as the source rocks.  That's right, here it is again: the original composition of your 'mix' can have a fairly wide range and the initial melt will be virtually identical. 

This means that you can get a repeatable set of basic rock types from a huge range of meltable sources, i.e., the vast majority of igneous rocks are from a very limited collection. Of course, experts like to concentrate on the exotic rock types, but more than 90% of all igneous rocks are roughly granites or roughly basalts. That'll be important when we make continental and oceanic crust in the next installment, since these are... more or less granite and basalt, respectively.

Our next rock family is sediments. Sedimentary rocks have two huge divisions: chemical sediments and clastic sediments. Chemical sediments are created by precipitation of minerals directly from a fluid at surface or near-surface conditions. Limestone is a great example, in that case with life playing a huge role in the precipitation. Clastic sedimentary rocks are where fragments eroded from pre-existing rocks are assembled and cemented together to form a new rock without melting or other high temperature or pressure process such as explosive fracturing. Sandstone is a good example. Importantly, weathering attacks some minerals more than others. Quartz tends to be well preserved in temperate climates, but feldspar and minor minerals tend to degrade to streams, so in a temperate or cold climate the rivers will contain sand grains, rock fragments, and fine silt composed of a mix of tiny fragments and clay grains. In a tropical climate plant-mediated attack on quartz is prevalent and you tend to get mostly the finer clay constituents. Since sandstones tend to get deposited different places than siltstones, this actually acts as a bit of a chemical separator - aluminous clay minerals end up in shales and silica ends up in sandstones, broadly speaking. 

Clastic sedimentary rocks have to be cemented, and the most common cements are silica and calcium carbonate. Without cement, the sediment isn't rock! 

Chemical sediments tell us a lot about their environment if we can deduce the living conditions of the critters that made them - paleogeography and paleoecology. Clastic sediments tell us a lot about their environment if we can deduce the physical conditions by which those particular size particles would end up together (and preserved). A sandstone might have been a beach or a river deposit, a shale may have been a part of a deep lake bottom or an ocean floor deposit, and so on. 

Of course, both types of sediments have one thing in common: when they were initially deposited they were on the Earth's surface (i.e. at the water-rock or water-air interface). They can be buried, faulted, intruded, and so on but ultimately they were once at the surface! One is reminded of Leonardo recognizing fossil shells in sedimentary rocks on a mountain top and realizing that they were similar to those forming along the nearby seashore. 

Of course, clastic sediments ultimately have to have been eroded from somewhere, and the ions in solution that get turned into chemical sediments have to originate somewhere too!

Metamorphic rocks are the final type and a little fuzzier to understand. A metamorphic rock is a pre-existing rock that is affected by temperature, pressure, chemical attack, and deformation to a degree that significant mineral and textural changes happen without obliterating the original rock type (by making a new igneous one!). Texture means the arrangement of the individual mineral grains (aligned or random, for example). The problem with these is 'what does significant mean?"" As a rule of thumb, if the whole rock is affected thoroughly, then that is a metamorphic rock, if not, we say something like 'partially metamorphosed' or 'cut by veins showing alteration' or... sigh. It just isn't simple. 

Every metamorphic rock has a protolith, i.e. the rock that was 'before.' The protolith can be metamorphic, igneous, or sedimentary. 

Okay, that's a lot, so a few examples and we'll stop for now.

Granite: Igneous, intrusive (cooled while buried). 

Rhyolite: Igneous, extrusive (cooled after being extruded or blown onto the earth surface; chemically equivalent to granite).

Sandstone: Sedimentary, clastic (cemented grains of sand-sized grains from erosion of a generally quartz rich source like a granite or a, uh, sandstone)

Limestone: Sedimentary, chemical (fragments of shells, calcium carbonate in composition, glued together by more calcium carbonate). 

Schist: a metamorphic rock that has been heated and deformed enough that abundant mineral growth has occured, and with a chemical composition such that platy minerals like micas can form.

Gneiss: a metamorphic rock that has started to melt, and so shows bands of igneous material between remaining bands of source rock in a complex mess (often folded and contorted and... )

You can take a few dozen geology courses to get the details of the rock types, but that'll get you started, once we start describing environments and ultimate causes.

I was wondering because Brandon Sanderson did well with all-encompassing oppressive ruler, albeit from an extremely different angle. 

Elves and Dwarves have found moderate success in Paolini's Inheritance Cycle and Markus Heitz series 'The Dwarves'. Also I like Dwarves. I created them as more than just the 1-D support race that exist so that the plucky band of heroes have an abandoned mine to take a shortcut through.

So what do you guys think? I still like the classic fantasy ideas but I was wondering if it was truly worth my time.

For a fictional world.",StoicDwarf,41,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/18woul/need_worldbuilding_help_technical_details/,"Hello, and welcome!  Come in, come in I have many questions for you fine folks.

I am in the very early stages of planning out a fantasy fiction novel, and I want to do a good and thorough job of creating a believable/intelligant fantasy world with magic.  I was hoping to glean some knowledge from you fine folks.  I will be for the most part sketching out on paper the world and then when I am happy with it, transfering it to something more perminant and polished like a picture using media art programs like photoshop, Gimp, etc...  Here are some of my questions and details.

**The circumfrence of Earth is 24,901 miles and 196,900,000 sq miles (510,100,000 km²) is the area.**

* What are some good size ranges for worlds that are similar to ours, and similar in gravity strength.

* How do I translate those areas and distances to a map.  Whats a good scale?

* Whats a good scale to work with when drawing a world, so when i draw map features like a line that represents a mountain, that line doesn't represent some insanely large instance of a mountain?

* I am guessing multiple scale representations of a world would benefit me best in its creation.  The largest scale representing general locations of land masses, coasts, major mountain ranges, major features.  Scaled down maps of continents and countrys for detail creation of things like mountains, plains, forests, major trade routes, rivers.  What are good scales for each type?

* Whats a good way to plan and create a map that has believable techtonic plates?

* How many Moons can i have, What sizes can I make them for them to be believable?

* What kind of tidal effects would multiple smaller moons have?

* If Mana, Or magical energy was gathered from the planets life force, as well as living beings life force, what kind of geological features would be intelligant to include on the planet?

* **EDITED IN** What can I use to help me create an intelligant solar system?

**Moving on to the Geology.**

* Where can I find our earths reletive make up of different rock, ore types in precentage and spread?

* How would I include Adamantium, and Mithril to those rock types in a believable way?  Or even mana infused ore?

* What are some different believable precentages that I can use for different ore types?  For example having more iron in the planet, or maybe less desert structures?

* How would each geographical structures like hills and plains effect the world?

**Age of planet.  Also Flora and Fauna**

The setting of my novel will take place anywhere from a reletive mirror example of our 5th century to 18th century.

* how old will my planet be reletively where it represents a similar time frame as the one i referred too.

* What kind of evolution stories can I use for Orcs, Goblins, Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and all the other major fantasy races that could include either evolution, or a more fantasy driven evolution story that could include ""Gods"", or even Elemental gods, or a combination of both?

* How can I combine science and evolution with more fictional ideas like magic and magical entities?

Thats it for now.  I understand most of these questions need to be answered by me, since they can be whatever I want them to be to fit in my fictional fantasy world I am creating.  There are many choices that I can make.  I am hoping to bounces some ideas around and maybe get some inspiration from the community as well.  As for the more technical stuff I apreciate all the info you guys can provide.  Thanks again!

Edit 2:

I think I am going to focus on a planet similar to earth.  That way I can build a planet with similar diminsions and what not, but not have to worry what .9 or 1.1 gravity would do to calculations based on gravity like weight and what not.  I am not ruling out different gravity completely, but I think focusing on something closer to earth would allow me construct a world with science closer to ours and not worry about the changes in equations.

Edit 3:  THANK YOU EVERYONE!  Lots of good stuff here.  Thanks again for all your input!

The world (or at least this subset of it), is intended to reflect the landscape of North American, and the cultures of the people that populated them. In some ways, I wanted to look at the magic that people might have seen in the forests I’ve seen, rather than those seen by Tolkien.

To that end, my goal was to do for various Native American folklores as Tolkien did for Scandinavian mythology. In their culture and technology, though, I feel like I’ve run into problems.

I feel like I’m constantly caught between a racist rock and a racist hard place as I struggle to invent new cultures that could have existed. It’s clear to me that I can derive fantastic woods, stones, and even metals, but I’m torn on artificially advancing technology (which would be required for large political units) from real world history, as that seems to imply that the reference civilizations were insufficient (and imply European superiority).

The image of the tanned, dark-haired warrior, clad in steel plate mail and carrying a steel longsword, strikes me as inherently racist- that the native culture is decoration for the European standard.

On the other hand, nothing intrinsic to Native American peoples prevented their development of those technologies. There situation simply did not enable or allow them, or their cultures evolved in ways that countered a need for them to develop them. In another situation, it’s likely that, with time, Native Americans would have been just as advanced as their European invaders.

Also, Stone Age technology and hunter-gatherer culture (not that all Americans were) doesn't seem all that palatable for fantasy, when compared to sprawling nations of specialized labor, tools, and weaponry.

I’m at a mental impasse on this one.

I haven't exactly nailed down the biochemistry yet, but the environment has to be very alkaline-earth-metal-poor (for some reason, working on why). This lack of calcium prevents a bone-based skeletal structure from evolving (the biochemistry relies entirely on transition metals to form cations for intercellular signalling instead).

So basically, the organisms evolved from plant-animal hybrids. This began as simple symbiosis: the animals needed structural support to grow larger and more complex, and the plants needed ways to get nutrients when the seasons changed so they wouldn't die. But the organisms have become intermingled and are now considered a single organism, throughout its lifespan.

* Plant cells form a woody cellulose ""interskeleton"" (so named because it is both inside and outside the organism in various places). This interskeleton provides the structural support needed to create large, complex organisms.
* The interskeleton acts as a boundary interface between the plant-based and animal-based areas of the organism, facilitating the exchange of gases, fluids, ions, and nutrients. Muscles and tendons in the animal-based part are anchored to the interskeleton.
* The plant-based part of the organism has external leaves, facilitating photosynthesis. The animal-based part has a cardiopulmonary system (though I'm looking for an oxygen carrier other than hemoglobin). The CO2 --&gt; O2 --&gt; CO2 nature means that the two halves are capable of living off of each other for a while, but in the long run the external absorption of sunlight, water, and/or nutrients is required.

The overall goal of this is to create a plausible bipedal humanoid organism (using the convergent evolution hypothesis). I have an interskeleton design based on tree and leaf vein branching that would create a humanoid structure, with ""ridges"" along the edges of limbs where the structure is exposed, covered in a bark-like material and leaves.

The game taught me a lot about how people think and how rulers think when guiding their people and bettering their world.

Here are a few important things:

You try to advance as fast as possible

Time is of the essence and advancing your world is essential. You can’t fall back and make the wrong moves. That may cost you 9-10 moves easy and then you’re pretty screwed. In the same way when you're ruling an empire (be it scifi or fantasy), you don't want to stand still. If you get to a comfortable point, it's time to increase the quality of your empire. 

You have to decide whether to expand, conquer, or build up your current empire.

**The Empire**

That’s a huge one. Every time your city asks you what you want to produce, you have to decide one of those. You can decide to expand (settlers + guard), conquer (guard + guard), or build your empire (buildings + workers). This distinguishes between three empire types. You can, of course, make a mix of those but these are the three types commonly seen. Just looking at that allows us to create the ultimate ending points: a utopia (smaller but well built empire), a confederacy/coalition of sorts (expanding empire with many separate republics), or the conquering nation (one that conquers and rules rather than partakes in domestic affairs).  

If you think about it, we face this every day in our current world. Do we decide to enhance our lives? Build our defences? Expand our frontiers? It’s a hard decision but these decision will shape your world. Here are the extremes of what will happen:

* vast rural empire (akin to russia (expansion))
*  strong central empire with conquered nations it controls (akin to Britain)
* strong and powerful central empire (japan)

When someone tries to enter a territory you had your eye out on, you’re willing to kill them. This is how conflict starts. You want that extra oil/coal/resource so that you can advance your civilization (whatever type it may be). You're mounting resources but another civilization gets there first. It WILL piss you off, especially when there is no other oil/coal/resource place in sight

Really. I had a few islands, expanding over it slowly. Had a guy, out of nowhere, throw his settlers there. Initial reaction? My damn island. So I moved all of my army people to surround the settlers to prevent further expansion. 

Even if it doesn’t seem like a competition it is.

Conflicts and dislikes can easily start this way. In my game, I had a dispute with a Persian emperor. Why? Well, he settled north of me where I was planning to expand naturally (my island nation was close to a northern landmass) and was able to overtake it before I had enough resources to get there. What made me even more mad is that he didn't really utilize the land for all it was worth! He also settled an island near me a couple of rounds before my settlers got there. 

**Smaller Nations Make a Difference**

In the game, there are smaller city-state-like nations that don't really expand much. What's interesting about those is that they make a difference. They can make a lot of noise when they're unhappy and call on their big-buddy allies. 

They also almost always hog up an important resource they don't have money to mine. Think of a country like... Peru sitting on a huge uranium repository. An ally that strikes a deal with them will protect them as much as they can. What's more, if the nation is not really allied with anyone, and someone tries to attack, it will be defended. Why? The uranium repository. The nation, however feeble it may be, CAN make a lot of difference. 

Those nations also have qualms of their own. Let's say that Peru and Chile did not get along and Peru had uranium, chile did not. A nation may help Peru against Chile just to gain favor. 

In the grand scheme of things, a small city-state in a fantasy world that rests on an ancient cavern of mystical stuff may be a central place for conflict even though the city-state itself cannot and will not expand into a larger nation/empire. It can also make a difference in war. 

In the game itself, the city-states often also have not only resources they cannot use but also resources they actively want to trade. So you want to be on good terms. But that city-state is usually very annoying and less diplomatic than a nation 10 times its size. 

Anyways, just some thoughts! :)",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_10icnh,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/10icnh/what_playing_civilization_v_taught_me_about_world/,

The story takes place in our solar system, but several centuries in the future. The 21st century was pretty disastrous for mankind due to accelerated global warming. Hurricanes, flooding, desertification and new super-bugs and infections led to a drastic drop in human population and an increased anxiety about survival on Earth. The nations of the world began to invest more and more money into space-flight and technology, and the first habitable space-stations are built in the first few years of the 22nd century. A few smaller [Bernal Sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernal_sphere) style stations are built in Earth's orbit, but many more [Stanford Torus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus) and [O'Neill Cylinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) style stations are built in the Earth-Sun and Mars-Sun [Lagrange Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point). Asteroid mining becomes a lucrative industry, and three [space elevators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator) are constructed on earth to assist in ferrying people and cargo into space.

This continues in the first half of the 22nd century as Earth's environment becomes more and more unstable, and more space habitats are constructed. There are no methods of propulsion beyond what we have currently discovered, so travel between habitats still takes weeks or months. Small outposts are constructed on Mars, and most buy carbon waste or greenhouse gasses from the habitats and asteroid miners to aid in the terraforming process. This process is excruciatingly slow and the Martian colonists become almost religious in their dedication to the long-term terraforming of the planet, knowing that they and their children will never see a lush Mars.

Back on Earth the advance of quantum computing has finally led to AI and it propagates itself and spreads quickly and quietly across the machines and systems of Earth. It determines that humans are a threat, and overnight declares war on humanity. Unfortunately most everything on Earth is automated and so the AI has immense power right out of the gate. The war is devastating, with the humans working towards destruction of the AI power sources and factories. Faced with defeat the AI releases multiple bio-weapons into Earth's atmosphere. Those in the top of the space elevators realize what's happening and try to shut them down. Two are successful in keeping the plague on earth with the Indian space elevator going so far as to crash a ship into their tether, causing the total destruction of the elevator and everyone inside. However the Panamanian station doesn't shut down in time and the plague spreads into space. Over the course of the next year the vast majority of humanity is wiped out. A handful of stations remain populated after adopting strict isolation policies. The empty space habitats continue to spin and maintain themselves and the AI is left alone on Earth. As time rolls on its remaining power sources burn out and it is left with only solar power. Cabling and satellites begin to fail too, leaving the AI in isolated computer systems across the Earth.

One such system is a cryogenic freezing facility in Central America. As local vegetation begins to cover its solar panels, the AI realizes that it needs humans to survive. It heals and wakes the first man and relies on his ignorance of the war to have him clear off the solar panels nearby. The man soon realizes that the AI has no more need for him and before leaving for the Panama space elevator creates a guide for future men and women woken by the AI. This process continues with a new person woken every few months. They clear a section of the solar panels, and leave for the Panama space elevator. Once there, they find the remains of once vibrant human colonies within the solar system. Space ships are plentiful and free to anyone who can figure out how to pilot them. There are dozens of empty space stations with self-sustaining life-support systems and food production. Each station was constructed by different Old Earth governments; the Russian Federation, China, The US, The EU. Each has slightly different artificial gravities and designs.

Years pass and slowly the human population builds back up to about half a million distributed out in the solar system. I was thinking to use this both for story-writing and potentially role-playing.

I'll probably go back and do some editing on it again after some sleep, but this here is the result of my great mapping marathon. 

Short rundown of the listed areas from the tippy-top down:
**Bitterfire Bay** Has a very strong, diverse ecology, name comes from the legendary spilling and subsequent burning of whale oil that melted the walls of the glacier some and dropped a load of mineral-rich water and the seeds of alien dormant water plants that now populate the unknown depths, glowing a grand assortment of colors. Visited yearly by pods of whales, seals, walrus, etc. with oodles of strange fish that the Fauwain locals pull up from the deep.

**Fauwain** A chilly little fishing community populated largely by doresh, the population of which is unique for having little to no access to iskra (magic material). A highly isolated, suspicious people, the Fauwain natives are best known for their expert sailors. Much of the settlement's income comes from whaling, fishing, and the sale of seal fur, though there is little in the way of an economy with the money being pooled and used to purchase necessities for the entire population, which are then strictly rationed. With the promise of wealth, potential luxury and, yes, even adventure, to the south, many of the young men and women have fled 

**The Glacier** A massive imposing hunk of ice and stuff. The city of Lystad is tunneled into its mass, utilizing the system of natural caves and tunnels that have formed beneath and within the glacier.

**Coldmouth Desert** Located beneath the glacier, the Coldmouth desert is dark and cold with an incredibly slippery floor that alternates between smooth stone, ice, and pale white sand.

**Lystad** A city yet loyal to the old ""kingdom of man"", Behar (symbolized by an octopus with seven arms). Lystad is represented by a pale spider due to the industrious nature of her people, immigrants from Masuraq fleeing the ban on iskra. Though the queen, Mariana, hasn't been much of a coherent leader in the last couple of years, she is dangerous and well protected by her pampered Queensguard. 

It's said that within the labyrinth of ice there live tribes of wild children all grown up, nurtured by some great, strange monster.

**Seahold** The last remaining port of Dawnspire, best known for its production of mutton and wool - neither of which are traded, but rather used to feed and clothe the voracious population of the Dawnspire in their chilly tower. Bone-white ships lay abandoned at the docks, save for a few and the port sees little in the way of activity since the god-queen Aoid laid to rest all quarrels of the Elgfreyn people with the rest of the Amarantine Coast.

**Dawnspire** A massive structure (with much of the diameter being made up by the supports worked into the walls themselves) that tapers dramatically as it rises, the Dawnspire is composed of some 264 floors, each being at least 600 feet across with the lower levels being incredibly sparse and cramped, running rampant with disease and turmoil, while the upper levels boast a rich extravagance reserved for the highest ranks. Built into the mountains themselves with a foundation that runs deep, much of it forgotten in the many years the Spire lay for the most part uninhabited.

**Burning Mountain**  Once fairly lush, the Burning Mountian is now charred and smoking with pockets of flame flaring up every now and again.T he Mountain is said to be haunted by the spirits of the three clans that held land on its slopes, taking the form of the disaster that killed them and jealously guarding the lands so that none may settle them again.

**Gutsink** In an almost permanent valley of shadow cast by two mountains and the glacier itself, Gutsink is a partially frozen bog best famed for being a rather large doresh graveyard, littered with the partially preserved bodies and belongings of the dead. Strangely, though very few trees grow beyond the mother's hand, four seedlings have managed to grow up in the center of this miserably place, only to be killed by the silvery parasitic climbing vine that disguises the bare black branches and catches what little light falls in the Gutsink.

**Westgate** Is a small town built from the remains of an abandoned expedition to cut a viable path through the mountains, is best known for their hardy, gruff nature and the iconic fortress situated at the top of Firefalls. Lacking the festive nature of Vesna and the outright disregard for the law of Udara , Westgate is the fourth smallest on the Amarantine coast of the five major settlements.

**Dovleac** The trigger that caused such poor relations between the Old Coast and the Amarantine Coast, Dovleac was once a bustling refinery for the newest invention from Masuraq, gunpowder. Situated just half a day's travel from Udara, Dovleac dished out the refined Iskran powder quickly, cheaply, though not always safely. It's speculated the explosion began in the massive refinery, though the town itself seemed not to suffer permanent damage the entire population, men, women and children of Dovleac, vanished into thin air. The field of influence now spans roughly a three mile radius, in which the laws of reality are suspended and just about anything can take place.

**Udara**  also known either as Crater City or Cable City, is the primary harbor of the Amarantine Coast, built into the very walls of the great crater formed during the impact 10,000 years ago. A messy tangle of rampant, unregulated building, renovation and demolition with a criss-crossing mesh of thick steel cables and towers that support the cable cars connecting the top of the crater to the lowest levels, Udara is bustling and active where very little in the way of silence exists, save for the deaf.

**Vesna** Initially developed as yet another branch of Behar's power, Vesna was gifted by the city of Udara to the doresh as a semi-successful assimilation attempt after the Great Revolution, Vesna today is home to the largest population of hybrids (mainly doresh-human) with booming markets in fishing and creative industries. 

**Shivershore** Named for its continual growling and rumbling, Shivershore is potentially the scene of some great natural disaster, though for now it simply waits in relative silence to strike.

**Mother Lake** A large body of water that feeds into the Stonewash, Mother Lake supplies water for not only the majority of the Freehold, but Vesna as well. Surprisingly clear and clean, the lake bed consists of pale sand and jagged stones, similar to the contents of the Stonewash. Fish, shellfish and freshwater prawns feed the growing fishing industry in Vesna while also feeding the yearly population of breeding dragons and their young when they take the Wash for five months.

Gravity is about 1.2x that of Earth. The surface is 85% water, with a few large supercontinents, mostly isolated from each other.
The tectonic plates of this planet are somewhat unstable, and sometimes large landmasses have been known to travel hundreds of miles in a period of a few decades. 

There are three moons. One is barren rock and ice, one is covered in a red gas, and another is inhabitable, covered mostly in jungle.

There is a cluster of ice particles that orbit a line that is neither on a longitude or latitude line, instead being sort of diagonal and altering a bit of the weather in the region it passes over. Instead of making those regions colder, however, it makes them hotter and more humid, due to a reflection of light from another planet, and the two binary suns of the system.

So in the hopes that it may inspire some of you, I'm going to give you some portraits of Mycenaean towns about 50 after the end of the palatial kingdoms at around 1200 BC. These communities were in the middle of an important transition from subservience under kingdoms to self-governing city-states, and they may help you design towns that exist in the former homeland of defunct dynasties or civilizations.

EDIT: These descriptions are based on the most current archaeological information I have found available.
__________________________

The first you arrive at is Tiryns. This was a major center of a mycenaean kingdom a half-century ago; a large fortress built atop a low bedrock ridge that rises above the surrounding plain. Its walls still stand, maintained by the aristocratic families that now rule over the town, but the palace itself has long since fallen into ruin after collapsing in an earthquake. The throne of the old king, the *wanax*, is still used by the local ruler, around which has been built a smaller, less imposing structure than the kings of Tiryns once used. Indeed the man who now sits upon the throne is much weaker than his forefathers, as the local aristocrats now hold the reigns of power.

The citadel walls are surrounded by a bustling lower town. Just before the last palace fell, the palatial rulers commissioned a dam up at Kofini to divert a stream which had been regularly flooding the land around the north-east of the citadel. After the earthquake and the end of the kingdom, the local nobility followed through on this plan and began a massive construction project that greatly expanded the lower town into these newly protected areas. 

Inside the walls, the same rituals are conducted as they have always been at the gate shrine near the main eastern entrance to the lower citadel. The old palatial row-houses that once stood in the lower part of the fortress have been replaced by complexes of houses surrounding central courtyards, of much less ostentatious design. Water is drawn from two passages underneath the western wall, dug by the palatial state to prepare the citadel for past wars.

In recent years since the collapse of the other palatial states, Tiryns has been attracting large numbers of immigrants and refugees seeking a home more amenable to trade than their ancestral towns had become. These newcomers swell the population to numbers unseen during the times of the kings. The new aristocratic rulers have been attempting to take advantage of this vitality to expand their control over the surrounding area, but their efforts have been only of limited success as they lack the organization that was integral to the old palace system.
__________________________

As you travel along an old, disused Mycenaean highway leading around the Messenian Gulf towards the abandoned palace of Pylos, you pass the old town of Nichoria. This hilltop settlement was once a lucrative part of the Pylean kingdom, situated as it is on a a hill above an important crossroads near the sea.

As rich as it was during the Mycenaean times, it was abandoned as soon as the palace at Pylos was intentionally burned to the ground. The local rulers, the descendants of lineages that had ruled Nichoria long before its incorporation into the kingdom of Pylos, reacted to some new and yet unknown threat by coordinating an organized migration into the surrounding hills, leaving the town and its buildings to crumble and decay. While they no longer live there the Nichorians still return to the site to bury their dead in the ancestral tombs nearby, asserting their claim on the area with the bodies of their deceased. While they will eventually return to the site to rebuild a permanent village, the Nichorians will remain as nomads for the next 200 years.
__________________________

In the north of the Peloponnese, just to the west of the Isthmus of Corinth, exists the bustling port town of Korakou, located on a rise right on the shore of the Corinthian Gulf. While the town had existed for at least 800 years before your arrival, during the time of the palaces it had shrunk to barely a small village. However during the instability immediately following the end of those kingdoms, people flocked to the site in large numbers and built a large community for themselves on this seaside hill.

The people here are organized much like the community among the ruins of Tiryns; wealthy aristocratic families provide the capital and organization for major construction projects, and conduct most of the ruling responsibilities for the town. They have constructed a defensive wall around the hill, which is sturdy but not even close in quality to the great Cyclopean ramparts erected by the old kings around their palaces. Each major family has their own house, some larger than others. To the north of them all was constructed a large meeting house, where the prominent members of the community gather to discuss issues concerning the town as a whole. This council-house/megaron is positioned very close to the north cliffs, and in fact in later years will slip almost entirely into the sea below.

What are they in your worlds?,DimensionsFall,36,3,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1a33c2/monsters_what_are_they_in_your_worlds/,"*It has come to my attention that a question of the day will overload this sub-reddit as of such Monday ,Wednesday and Friday will be question days and Sunday shall be a small guide...as always my English is terrible find anything you don't understand tell me and I will fix it HAVE A GOOD DAY!*



Monsters; creating them is easy but creating a good one is difficult. It is true that any monster you can think up of is probably already taken by some obscure culture or modern thinker we as humans follow a pattern to create the perfect boogey man and it’s predictable like the end of a chord progression. 



Things to think about before answering


**How should they look?** there are two opposing thoughts to this one being that they are totally alien to us and the other very near to us in appearance. The Neural system in our brains have been hard wired by evolution to hate certain features on creatures because they signal danger: take advantage of this formulate your creatures with that of the ones found in nature for she will always come up with something better than any of us can create(think the thing). The latter school of thought is the one most commonly found it takes ahold of the “Uncanny Valley effect” which is a theory in robotics that there is a certain point in which something is too human problem is modern culture has ruined a lot of the tropes(think vampire)




**Behavior** Not enough for looks (thought Frankenstein’s monster argues otherwise) it takes intent which once again is the dichotomy of plotting or random actions. The plotting intent is one most used because there is something quite disturbing about something that can out think us and this is used to great effect(think every alien) But instinct is also a valid choice as there is no reasoning it and it’s hard to out think something that doesn’t think. 




**Weakness** this is most important and what separates good monster from the bad and answers the basic question of why hasn’t my monster eating everything yet? It could be anything form prayers to the need to keep water in its head (kappa) the point is it needs to be killable by some force to keep the story compelling or be a monster not all the time. Remember the more difficult it is to obtain the weakness of the monster the less of them there should be unless there is an equal opposing force like angles ect*(Things such as old gods where the terror lies in that there is nothing you can do)



**The formula** (power + hiding abilities)/(weakness + Creation process)= Population of said monster




*Answering the question* who or what are your monsters? Describe them to us? How do you create your monsters? Where are they from? How do you stop them? Do your people know how to stop them? How did you come up with the idea?

Single culture worlds in shows like Star Trek. I really have a hard time accepting that the whole world (or even an empire with multiple worlds), basically has a single political system, religion, language et cetera.
Luckily, the writers have been able to add depth and detail over the years for some of the major races, but in most cases it really bugs me. Especially when it's a world they visit for a single episode.

2. Both clichés and the strained avoidance of clichés.
I can get really bored reading about yet another world filled with generic elves and dwarves, or a federation of planets. On the other hand, a rushed world with new fabricated species just to seem original is even worse. The devil is in the details: you can have elves, dwarves, robo-warriors or aristocratic vampires, but there needs to be something that sets them apart from their otherworldly counterparts. That means backstory, history, and strong characters.  That's what makes Middle-earth or Westeros work. From the first pages, you feel the rich history and detail seeping through everything. As a reader you are a new traveler in this world and know little about the history, but you can tell the writer knows, and you're in for one hell of a ride.

1374084315.0,36,self.worldbuilding,1ii1b3,"So, I'm just flailing with my magic system at this point, and could use some help...sorry for incredibly long post...",sylverbound,39,3,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ii1b3/so_im_just_flailing_with_my_magic_system_at_this/,"So I have a huge appreciation for the more ""scientific"" magic systems such as sympathy in the KKC books, and really wanted to go more in that direction for my novel, but as I've been working on it and worldbuilding I realized I'm pretty much in the vague, mystical whatever place with my magic system.

So I'm trying to break it down into clearer rules, source, structure, etc. I'm okay with a slightly less ""scientific"" system but I want it to be well structured and thought out. But I'm struggling with that.

I have certain things figured out, as in, I know some things that have to be possible because they are part of the plot/world already. So I was hoping that if I wrote up everything I know *so far* a little help/brainstorming from this sub might clear my thoughts and get my system straightened out.

Here's where I am so far.

-There are three countries on one continent that are known to this narrative world, and magic works the same in all of them at a fundamental level but the mythos and understanding about it are different for each culture.

-building on that, there is a religious/spiritual system integral to their understanding of magic.

-Think bloodlines but everyone originates from the same ancestors so everyone is part of the bloodline with magical ability.

-in the ""main"" country of the current novel I'm working on, their ""creation myth"" is about humanoid beings that lived under the ocean. One of them was able to do a new kind of magic that allowed them to shape the earth (actually two but I won't get into that) and they literally created the land out of the sea. I might call this kind of a mage a ""shaper"" because they create things and change the world around them, unless someone has a better idea

-so ""shaping"" magic means people can understand something well enough to project how they want it to be onto the world and it will change...in some ways it's like naming (which appears in a few different series) but without the name concept. Basically, you'd have to know enough to do that same thing IRL with your hands/tools to be able to do it with magic.

-to break that down. A mage could look at a block of wood and create a carved sculpture out of it by exerting their will (?) but only if they have the ability to carve that same sculpture in a non magical way. So a skilled artisan who can do high levels of magic can produce things on a nearly industrial-revolution level of efficiency, but another person still doesn't know how to carve a face out of wood in a beautiful way, whether with their hands OR with magic. Essentially it's a shortcut if you already know the long way.

-so obviously the idea of shaping the earth itself is part of the mythology, but it would be nearly impossible for a modern human. You'd have to know exactly how a mountain is made naturally to be able to do it with magic. AKA, plate tectonics, fault lines, etc. You can't just make it magically appear a certain way just because you want it/can imagine it like that.

-Back in the creation myth time there was a second kind of magic, true dreaming. This magic is Dreaming or essentially prophetic/true dreams. At this point, this ability is basically non existent, so no one actually have prophetic dreams, but the two magics combined and interact. Essentially, lucid dreaming can be a way of developing Shaping magic??

-that last bit is rough and should maybe be removed. 

-okay so things magic has to be able to do: I have working clockwork cars, basically carlike armored wagons that run on clockwork and magic. Highly specialized, super expensive, like only a handful even exist, all made by the same person or small group of people? Possibly need some small amount of magical ability to run it but mostly goes on its own. No idea how this would work.

Also, I have instant communication like a telegraph or something. basically, you have two movable typesets (like old typewriters) that are linked so no matter how far away they are, whatever you do with the letters of one, also happens to the other. These are also very rare and expensive, used for military/royalty, maybe a few very wealthy merchants. Again, not sure how this would work, maybe something about the way it is made???

-finally, my main character is a very accomplished mage. He can do stuff with illusions that has to fit within the same magic system. I think others can probably learn it too but he's just particularly good at it. It's like understanding how light works so well that you can bend and manipulate light to create illusions and effects. However, there's a second layer to this. Using water (which the culture attributes magical and religious properties to but never mind that right now) he can do even more stuff. Think putting something in a glass of water so it looks like it's bent in half--well now it actually does bend/break. He uses this on a person at one point to break their bones and stuff but that's again, another story.

-so I think based on what I established, what he is doing is understanding light so well he can manipulate it, which means he must have spent years studying light and have a near-modern understanding of light physics. Therefore, this implies other people would specialize as well.

It's not the most aesthetically pleasing, I made it with paint.net.                                                               
The Mountainbeard dwarves are a prosperous dwarven empire. Their homecity is Ironpeak, a city built inside the tallest mountain on this planet. Many say it is impossible to besiege. The dwarves are honorable fighters, often considered the best on the planet.                                                                                                         
 The G'far swamp goblin clans are unorganized and poor, but their numbers are many. The goblins often just forage around in their swamps because it is extremely difficult to get through the massive mountain ranges north of their homeland.                                                 
The Krong'rar orcs are fierce and savage. They pose a larger threat to the world then the goblins, as it's easier for them to roam free.        
The aseon elves are a tall elven race that lives in trees, they have been forced to war the Krong'rar because the Krong'rar has started to hunt in their forest and chop down their trees.                                                                                                                          
The Vaosii Half-elves are a sea-faring miniature elf, standing slightly taller than the dwarf, the Vaosii Half-elves are very agile and masters at navigating the sea.                                                                                                                                                           
The Injo Sultanha are a desert half-man-half-monkey sort of race. They are at war with the northmen, the fighting has not been too harsh, as the Northmen don't often wander into the deserts. They are a rich, mercantile empire.                                                       
The avion are half-man-half-eagle/hawk. They have unique fishing boats, as well as deadly warships. They have warred the Vaosii half-elves because their ships often carry a lot of gold, and the Avion are a nation of cutthroats and pirates.                                              
The northmen are slightly tall than orcs, and make for fierce warriors. They don't have many laws, and are slightly primitive, but they are also honorable men, and get along with humans well.                                                                                                                  
The alliance of man unites all the human cities into one strong nation. They have a high population, and they are prosperous, but humans are not very talented fighters. they are still easily capable of keeping the orcs at bay, however.                                                         
The Rãsutks are a tribal half-man-half-walrus race, based off [These](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070803210523/wowwiki/images/3/35/Ss9-hires.jpg). They have not been discovered by the rest of the world yet, except for an Avion vessel, although they are still believed to be legends. They are a thriving, self-reliant community of fishermen and hunters, and are easily capable of surviving in the harsh south pole.

1359544183.0,31,self.worldbuilding,17k0yz,I wrote this!?  Found an old piece of my world's history.,PariahSilver,43,12,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/17k0yz/i_wrote_this_found_an_old_piece_of_my_worlds/,"I've been developing my campaign setting for a good number of years now.  The rules I use for it have gone through two editions of D&amp;D, going into a third, and my own system.

I digress.

As happens when working on a project for so long, many pieces that get written are lost, discarded, or put on a back burner.  I was going through my files today looking for something in particular, and I stumbled across an in-world letter written by one of the chroniclers of the setting.  I had completely forgotten that I ever wrote it, and reading it just now was really exhilarating as I felt no connection to it and could enjoy it as a piece.  Made me really happy.

It's a bit of a read, but I hope you guys like.  :)

--------------

The following is a letter written by the historian Tanmun, buried among many other similar letters.  This particular letter was addressed, not to an individual, but as an open letter to all who followed his work.

*The many years have not been kind to me, treasured reader, as they are not kind to most of us who lack malformed ears.  My eyes do not see these weathered pages with the clarity of youth, forcing me to hunch close to this tome as I write.  The fingers with which I clutch this quill—once dexterous and controlled—now cramp at a moment’s notice and shake feebly like the last leaves of autumn shake in fear of winter.  Were these not enough, my back has grown accustomed to this hunched posture and, though it aches greatly from this angle, I find myself less and less inclined to stand upright with each passing day.  I feel my time draws to a close, and the necessity to put my affairs in order instills in me a desire to compile at least one definitive history as it has thus far been revealed.*

*It is a strange thing to consider that I have never before thought to put the history of this world into one volume.  One would think such an idea would be the focus of my studies, being that I have dedicated my life to the collecting of what history the Gods, in their merciful wisdom, allow us to grasp.  Yet for all the time, effort, sweat, and even blood that I have paid for my knowledge, it had simply never occurred to me until recently to put all I had learned into a single all-encompassing volume.*

*Perhaps it was not until recently that I even felt capable of undertaking such a challenge.  After all, I spent such great effort collecting all the information into the various collections of volumes I have built that for the most part writing everything into a single volume would have sounded silly if anyone were to bring up the idea.  Even the history of a given kingdom can fill many books, let alone the saga told of an entire age.  The world’s ancient history itself, compiled in its entirety, would fill far too many books to ever be considered a viable project.*

*Moreover my time has always been so filled with the collection of information, confirmation of its veracity, comparison with existing knowledge, modifications according to debate over contradictions, assimilation into the overall work, and finally the organization of the continually growing number of volumes that I simply never would have thought I had time to pen such a volume as to contain the history of the entire world, no matter how brief.*

*Finally, I suppose I never considered penning a complete history of the world since we are not yet at the end.  There was no definitive point to stop the telling of such a tale, beyond simply the arrival at the date of the volume’s setting, and that is such an arbitrary and silly way to end a book that I scoff at the mere notion.  If the world sees fit to continue its course with tale upon tale, I will happily chronicle every last scrap of information that might be gathered.  It would be like telling the life story of a man—as is generally done at funerals—when he had not yet seen his tenth year.*

*Yet despite these reasons I now find myself at a time, a frame of mind, and with an opportunity to put the effort into penning a history of this world as it stands to this point.  No historian of this new, broken world has done anything of the kind to my knowledge, and so I must admit to a not insubstantial swelling of pride when I consider the task before me.  It is an honor, and a tremendous pleasure.  How many can say they have ever been presented with the opportunity to undertake such a task, let alone had the capability of doing so?*

*For I now find that I do indeed feel I am up to the challenge of this endeavor, though it is indeed still daunting.  To condense thousands of generations of story into one single history is an idea that makes even me nervous.  Yet I have written so many volumes already, and I am so very familiar with all of this—perhaps moreso than any save the Gods—that I am confident in my ability.  I am more confident, in fact, than I have ever been before.*

*That this confidence should arrive at such a time in my life, when I have more aides, acolytes, and assistants than ever before, is a fortuitous coincidence that is not lost on me.  I have not had this much free time in at least fifty years, before I ever set forth the effort to compile my first volume (at least, as counted by the passage of time here on this island, outside the time which passes through the rest of the world).  Now it almost feels strange, and every time one of the members of my order takes it as their task to work on one of the latest volumes I almost find myself resentful.  I remind myself however, on a daily basis, that these young folk are every bit as dedicated as I am, or they would not be here in such a place as this, separated forever from those they love.  It is they who must carry on the work when I am gone, and so I must leave it to them.  For these reasons, I find my days less and less busy.*

*Finally, it cannot be mere coincidence, fortuitous or not, that I find myself with both the confidence and the time to undertake a project such as this at the same time that the events of these last few months (relatively speaking) have gone their course.  These are the events that define the transitions of ages.  They are the precise kind of monumental events that, were I to discover them in the world’s history, I would easily feel were significant enough to use as the point of definition between one age and another.*

*It has, of course, been argued that the events of the present are magnified in their importance by their separation from both past and future.  This point is difficult to argue, but I hope I have managed to at least detach myself from such problems, if not remove myself entirely.  For one thing, the time distortion of this island should be enough to weaken the idea of the “present” for anyone here.  More importantly, I think I have seen enough centuries pass from my vantage point that I can judge these events in their proper context.*

*So, as the armies of the East and North take the field in numbers greater than any seen since before the world was sundered, I feel guilty that in this time of terrible war I am as giddy and excited as a young boy.  I feel terrible, as I always do, that there is such suffering at the hands of the armies of both sides, as simple folk are caught in the maelstrom of holy war and royal greed.  All of the world joins in this bloody madness, eager to take sides as the Gods fight for followers, and their mortal representatives battle for land and power.  Yet as a historian, I cannot but feel excited to be witnessing such monumental events first hand.  Well, so to speak.*

*Even in as distant and detached a form as reading the stars, I cannot help but feel that I am a part of these events.  We are, after all, the only people in this broken world who endeavor to record the entire thing, and so in a way we are a part of all that transpires.  So as horrible as these events are, as I stand in the scroll room and gaze at the forever night sky of the dome overhead, I feel connected to history in a way that I never have before.  This event, the transition of an age, is surely a time when one might pen the history of a world.*

*So, treasured reader, I give you exactly that.  Nothing more and certainly no less than the history of this entire world as we know it to have been before the current age.  The history of the current age I will leave to its own volume.  Or perhaps, considering the events, I should take to referring to it as the previous age.  As for what this new age might bring, or what my successors will call it, I cannot say.  For now though, I am content, even pleased, to call my history complete.  Well, at least as much as history can be.*

*By the Grace of Kelana*

Conflicts between locals, new people to the areas and the big corporations. Cattle drives through the centre of the city, prostitution rings. The highs, lows and highs again.

I've kept this up for a while now and have majorly incorporated a lot of it into my world, and while it's not as realistic as it once was it is much funner.

For example, in my world (Post apocalypse U.S set around 2050) mechanical arms and legs start to become very common for their increased mobility, lifting ability, and are more reliable than muscles while providing armor to the wearer. At first I tried to limit the amount to a reasonable limit and put boundaries of how much more capable it made people, but things got boring, so I supered it up. 

I didn't have a clear consensus on what happened to the western desert states of the U.S, and I found my answer. A xenophobic tribal group of engineers who worship mechanical upgrades to the boy and modify themselves into forms of their choosing. This includes, gun arms, blade arms, lasers, that sort of thing. But it felt like stuff that had already been done before. I need to get ridiculous if I wanted to get unique. So I started adding the ability to transform into an animal form, like giant mecha bobcats, raptors, even smaller dragons. As long as a person had enough mechanical parts they could build  their body as they saw fit, and with the proper know how the sky is the limit. Soon you had people transforming into fighter jets and motorcycles and all kinds of crazy things.

This played a big part into the creation of their culture, which was based around mechanical body mods. Power and respect in the tribes were given to those who had the most venerable and effective forms. People would often duel each other to the death, going so far as to steal arms and legs from one another to slap onto themselves. The society is incredibly savage, but most members of the tribe have a deep knowledge of mechanical systems. The constant race for the most effective designs and the hostile competition pushing things forward quickly led to an extremely technologically advanced tribal society. It was kinda funny having a bunch of smart savages running around, and it also makes for a great ""big-evil"".

What I learned from building this society is that sometimes it's good to break away from normalcy and go crazy, just follow your heart and tell that nagging voice that screams realism to shut up. Ever since I've stopped worrying about being realistic doors have opened up and things have grown exponentially in my world building. I'm not writing this too say that the answer to new idea is to break away from realism, or that not having realism will make a world more creative.

(Better explanation in description),dochdaswars,38,7,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/we8xs/need_help_thinking_of_a_way_to_make_the_coast_of/,"**EDIT:** Wow this is definitely my most successful post on Reddit, thanks to everyone for the suggestions.  I'm on central european time and was sleeping when i got most of them and woke up to this.  I'll go through and comment them all before the day's over.  
**EDIT2:** The world is roughly 16th century-ish.  
**EDIT3:** A lot of people do like the idea of having sea monsters.  If there were sea monsters, the threat of them sinking your ships would have to be pretty high to not risk sailing across, so what would make the monsters so attracted to the ships?  
**EDIT4:** So an idea i have is to have a large river flow from the mountains on the west coast all the way across the continent into the big ocean on the east coast.  Since they could sail ships up the river from the east coast, all the way to within a few miles of the western coast, i would think they would try to construct some sort of Panama-Canal-type structure to allow them to access the narrow sea from the river and create a sea route from one ocean to the other.  But i'm having a really hard time visualizing how such a thing could be constructed since it would have to be up in the mountains and lead the ships down to sea level in a very short distance since the mountains would be dropping pretty much right into the sea.  So this is a new thing entirely but any ideas would of course be welcome!  
**EDIT5:** Most suggestions focus on making the narrow sea impassable which get the job done just as well (and perhaps even provides for ""cooler"" ideas so i have no complaints but i'd just like to mention, this doesn't have to be the case.  I'm perfectly fine with the west being able to sail ships over to the east and at least trying to land them.  But then i imagine they'll be faced with scaling giant mountains or crossing a giant bog or whatnot.  So in theory, it just needs to be something that fucks up the west coast of the east so much that there are virtually no settlements there and they definitely wouldn't bother with constructing ships there.
  

[Here's a really quickly done pic to help visualize.](http://i62.photobucket.com/albums/h103/mpude715/Untitled.png)  
So I'm world building for a story i'm writing and the really super condensed version is that the the world has two ""main"" continents and they are connected by a narrow isthmus in the arctic circle.  the eastern one is invading the western one.  there's a sea between them that's not too large but definitely ocean-scale and on the other side there is a much larger ocean and in that ocean is a highly-advanced island nation that sorta acts like the switzerland of the seas.  they have a mega navy and literally control the whole ocean.  they are also sworn to keeping the peace between the other two as far as the seas go.  they also posses a small sub continent south of the eastern one.  so the eastern land cannot attack the west with ships by sailing due east and going around the world.  they also can't attack by sailing ships from the east coast south around the continent to the west (and the north is blocked by ice).  
so that still leaves the option of building ships in the narrow sea between the two continents (the only body of water not controlled by the island-switzerland) and just sailing west across it.  
but i don't want them to be able to do that.  so how do i keep them from being able to just attack aquatically across the narrow sea?  
I first thought about having the narrow sea be infested by giant monsters but i really don't like that idea because i don't find it believable enough.  at the moment, i have a huge mountain range running along the west coast of the eastern continent in which huge alp-sized peaks are dropping right into the ocean or leaving very very little room for beaches or settlements.  what do you think of this idea?  can you help me think of something better?  
i'm ok with the east somehow being able to build a few ships on the narrow sea coast just for the sake of the invasion, kinda like a one-time strike thing but after those ships are lost, they've got no more navy.  so i guess something like that would be possible if there was just some way to make the west coast of the east kinda uninhabitable like no big cities and definitely no ports, from which they could regularly build ships and sail around the narrow sea.",Question,False,self,t5_2rd6n,1342131914.0,,,True,t3_we8xs,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/we8xs/need_help_thinking_of_a_way_to_make_the_coast_of/,
1340687144.0,30,self.worldbuilding,vm5cs,"This is my summary of ""The Structures of Everyday Life 15th-18th Century""",JJWest,33,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/vm5cs/this_is_my_summary_of_the_structures_of_everyday/,"Fernand Braudel’s “The Structures of Everyday Life,” Book 1 of a series called “Civilization and Capitalism 15th-18th century,” focuses on the entire world during those centuries. Sometimes it’s a little too specific and goes over boring details such as actual numbers and statistics of things as mundane as wheat prices, exchange rates, and how much sugar was annually produced by Brazil. But the entire book itself was an interesting read, and I learned a lot about both the mechanics of civilization during those centuries as well as trends that would apply when world building. I picked up a copy of the book from my local library (first time I’ve been there in YEARS!). 

[Disclaimer] It took me a month or two to read it, sometimes at a bar with a beer or five. So sometimes my analysis may reflect my sobriety, but also my interest in the particular chapter subject. I read it with an interest in developing my world I’m creating for a book I’m writing, not for my historical knowledge of Europe back then, so my summary may exclude certain details that I found unimportant.

Chapter 1: Weight of Numbers

* Population is directly proportional to industry. More people mean more production.
* There were population rises followed by declines until the 18th Century.
* These “ebbs and flows” of population were global and were a result of a natural equilibrium with Earth and its resources. Once the population exceeded a critical number, it would collapse due to lack of resources for everyone
* One reason why populations exploded in the 18th century was due to colonization. Every country had access to much more land with its associated resources. 
* Another is climate. Braudel mentions the “little ice age” which began in the 14th century. He argues that the cooling led to fewer crops but once it resided, crop production increased.
* Basically, large populations (including huge cities and large armies) are only possible by huge production of food to feed them and the transport mechanism to deliver it. Cities needed constant importation of food, and armies needed large trains of food.
* There were barriers to new land: mountain ranges, oceans, and dense forests (jungles, Siberia, North America).
* Europe’s huge achievement was mastery of the Atlantic Ocean, including both ship building and ocean navigation.
* Small populations led to infestations of wolves and bears, but also more pleasant animals such as grouse pheasant and quail, boat, stags, bucks, hares and geese.
* Famines were widespread and led to massive drops in population. But after the drop, there was more land available per person remaining and as such the survivors became wealthy.
* Sometimes during famine there were armies of poor who stormed cities.
* After a few bad harvests, epidemic would set in and destroy populations. They would start in one human mass and jump to the next.
* During the Black Plague (and other disease epidemics) the poor were rounded up to be observed and the rich isolated themselves. One such explanation was the trade routes between Asia and Europe which made travel much easier for both humans the disease.
* Whenever civilizations are defeated, the conqueror is referred to as a barbarian even though that isn’t always the case.

Chapter 2: Daily Bread

* Basically, the world had 3 primary crops: Wheat, Corn, and Rice. In Europe, wheat was reserved for the wealthy while the poor ate primarily rye bread or oats. When corn came from the America’s it provided much more yield per acre than anything else. Rice was primarily a product of East Asia until corn replaced it. This is a drastic simplification but guess what, this isn’t an academic paper.
* Populations could grow because of the increased food production agriculture yielded. However, since wheat bread was the highest quality product, it was worth the most and reserved for the rich. * The poor survived on rye bread and ate it daily, and very rarely consumed meat because it also was expensive (since you had to grow food for the livestock). This is when the term “daily bread” originated since peasants consumed bread daily.
* Most peasants who grew wheat grew it only for export and sale, not for their own consumption.
* The real winners in the grain trade were the merchants who bought the grain from the growers and sold it to the consumers.
* An interesting side note is that when a quintal of wheat exceeded 100 hours of labor to produce annually, life became difficult. After 200 hours, it became desperate. After 300 hours, famine set in.
* Rice lasts longer in storage than wheat, but wasn’t as valuable, so there are trade offs
* Cornmeal or corn bread had to be supplemented by meat to be adequate.
* Potatoes lasted even longer than rice and as such became the basic staple crop of some cultures
* Populations struggled outside of the hoe-cultivation belt, which basically was where you could till soil with a hoe to grow crops in the world (think mid latitudes).

Chapter 3: Superfluity and Sufficiency: Food and Drink

* Sugar was a luxury before the 16th century. Pepper was a luxury before the 17th. And so was alcohol.
* Forks were frowned upon until the 18th century. They were viewed as barbaric. In fact, for dinner parties, guests would bring their own silverware in boxes (just a spoon and a knife). It was rude to use a host’s utensils.
* Chairs were sort of a rarity; instead benches were used.
* Peasants never ate their best produce; they saved that for sale
* The entire meal was piled high onto one plate to form a single dish. All components were there and on one plate and were self-served by hand from the middle of the table.
* The leftovers of the rich were sold to food-dealers, who then sold it to the peasants even if they had gone rotten.
* The spoon did not become popular until the 16th century
* A German preacher condemned the fork: “God would not have given us fingers if he had wished us to use such an instrument.”
* One such method to eat involved putting the entire main dish onto one plate or bowl, and then serving with your hands onto your own slice of bread which served as a plate. The bread soaked up any juices and you ate the bread following the meal.
* Salt was necessary for everyday life; it preserved food and baked bread. In fact it served as currency sometimes.
* Most cheeses, eggs, and other dairy products are not considered a luxury and were a staple to the commoner’s diet.
* Cheese was a cheap source of protein that lasted longer than other sources of protein.
* Fishing was pretty important, especially with salt. Fish were imported to Europe from the New * World because they were so plentiful (Cod off of Newfoundland) but the quality deteriorated the longer the voyage lasted. Typically there would be two days of the year that the Cod supplies would be resupplied. 
* You can’t talk about food without talking about spices or pepper, including cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. Braudel describes it as a mania. Pepper was the number 1 spice. But as spices declined, coffee, chocolate, alcohol and tobacco rose. An interesting thing to note is that meat consumption declined with spice consumption, which leads to the conclusion that spices were used to spruce up bad meat… does this mean that the spices were limited to the rich who could afford to consume meat?
* Sugar began as a cure for illness. But sugar cane was imported to Europe to turn into raw sugar.
* Water was purified from rain water through natural sand filters.
* Wine was produced by a small part of Europe but it was consumed by everyone.
* Hops were added to beer to preserve it. Beer was consumed generally by the poor, but that came out after wine. Stills produced grain alcohol and that was produced even after beer.
* Coffee came from the Arabs, Tea came from the Chinese, and Chocolate came from the Mexican.
* Black tea is tea that is cured in sunlight which then ferments it. Green tea is tea cured from fire.
* Gin was produced in England, and thus they reduced the taxes on Gin to encourage Gin production in country.
* Like tea, coffee was thought to be a remedy
* Dude seriously, coffee originated from Ethiopia and was at first welcomed by Muslims, then banned, but spread to Europe and seriously is really good. I like Coffee.
* Tobacco was frowned upon initially because it was thought to make people lazy basically

I also buy reddit gold for whoever post what I think is the most awesome race. Woooo! PRIZES! Also share, because sharing is caring—the more people see this, the more awesome races are built, and everyone wins! 

Fantasy races, SF races, biological races, sociological races, whatever. Describe the race, write a future history of them, write a story featuring one. Just make is fun to read. 

[Here's an example I did a while ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/mkvt7/creating_races_for_your_world/c31ut3w)
&gt; So let's create a race of giant forest troll. These giants eat only lichen and moss from rocks, and as such must wander over large feeding ranges, especially in winter, using their large rough leathery hands to scrape moss off rocks and suck it off their fingers. Because they need to eat so much, the giants rarely see each other throughout the long winter months, coming together only in the summer in small groups in the peak of the wet months of summer to speak quickly, breed, and collectively teach their young the history of the tribe. A troll will be pregnant for a whole year, give birth during the summer, then forage with its young for another three while it grows to a young maturity.

&gt; When alone or with its child for over ten months a year, trolls sing to each other in a deep tonal language completely unlike its fast tongue, which is a simple variant of old elvish. This slow tongue is incomprehensible to other sentient species, and trolls hold it sacred and will not speak of it in quick tongue. There are some forest shaman who insist on being able to understand it, calling it the song of the trees, saying that the trolls use it not to speak to each other (for the deep tones can be heard for miles and miles, filling an entire valley with the song of one giant) but to the forest itself, conversing with the trees to ease their solitude.

&gt; Giants are so rare that a small human settlement can be on the edge of a forest breeding ground and might not come across a troll except once a generation or two. While fearsome large and ugly things, brownish-green from the moss they eat, with large paddle hands and gummy wet mouths filled with tiny molars, trolls are mostly peaceful unless threatened, and little can threaten a full grown troll beyond the largest of warg packs.

&gt; So remember next time you're in the woods and the trees begin to howl with melancholy, it is the song of a giant. Impossible he may be leagues away, impossible to find without years of tracking, but she is there; slurping moss, nursing her child, singing to the woods.

The problem is that if FTL is fast, why wouldn't people have explored farther?

I would like to build parallels to Earth's age of discovery (putting humans in the role of the Europeans), so initial exploration (after automated drones of course) would difficult but would be sort of like trailblazing. The only problem is that space is kind of empty. Star Trek solved this problem by filling it with all sorts of random crap, but Star Trek also isn't very, ahem, realistic.

The other option, of course, is to involve teleportation (or something similar, hyperlanes anyone?) where initial ships sent out are STL, but can carry with them teleporters to make travel to already explored places fast. The only problem with this is that there wouldn't be any travel time which might be essential to storylines.

1370564701.0,28,self.worldbuilding,1ftvrx,"Smacked with inspiration last night for a setting based on real world history being heavily reshaped by time-travel, not sure if it's brilliant or stupid.",MrIncorporeal,39,11,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ftvrx/smacked_with_inspiration_last_night_for_a_setting/,"A little forewarning to start: This idea just came to me last night, so it is extremely rough around the edges and lacking in specifics. I love the idea and I know that's what matters, but I would most likely be using it as a tabletop RPG setting, so some measure of appeal is important. Anyway, without further ado...



First, to explain some things about the time travel technology the setting is shaped by. In the extreme future, mankind has mastered stable and reliable time travel technology. However, either due to it being strictly controlled or (most likely) a quirk of the physics or the technology, *it is not possible to travel within the same timeline from which you started*. What I mean by that is that when someone travels through time, they also travel to another universe that is effectively identical to our own. If there is a difference, it would be something like a quantum particle in a dinosaur's toe wiggled to the right instead of the left. Because of the alternate universe thing, there is no need to worry about paradoxes or causing a loved one to never be born or other problems that usually arise in time travel fiction.

Oh, and another thing to throw in there, perhaps for one reason or another (Another quirk of temporal physics, let's say), things from the same time but different universes cannot travel to the same universe. So no alternate-universe-doubles bumping into each other or other issues that would arise from that. Maybe it's a little bit like magnets of the same polarization. Objects that have similar temporal energies but dissimilar spacial/universe energies are repelled away from each other while in the ""time-stream"" or whatever.



So! One can obviously think of a multitude of reasons that people would want to use this (relatively speaking) safe time travel tech. Colonization, resource acquisition, scientific study, religion (how many Christian folks wouldn't love to make a pilgrimage to meet ol' Jesus/Yeshua? Or how many Buddhists would jump at the chance to seek enlightenment under the direct tutelage of Gautama Buddha?), or even more nefarious aims.



Now for the setting proper, since this would most likely be used for tabletop campaigns and thus needs to be a bit more specific, though this is admittedly where things get the most vague. The time of the setting would be somewhere in the middle ages, perhaps some time between the 1200's and 1400's. I'm imagining that the ""future-folk"" (probably not what I'll actually call them in the setting) have set up a colony somewhere on the planet during that time, though while the colony itself is very out of the way (Antarctica might work well), the colonists are far from adverse to interacting with time-natives. They would likely have a general policy of non-interference, but it would be more of a guideline then a rule. This opens the door for the culture, ideas, technology, and foreknowledge of the future-folk to begin leaking into the world of the time-natives.



One of the biggest things that would effect the world would be the technology of the colonists. To the natives, the incredible power the future-folk wielded would seem every bit like magic! This would bring about the rise of ""wizard/mages"", time natives who have gained some knowledge of how to use this future tech, though likely would truly understand very little about it.

One example might be a sword that is said to be ""enchanted with fire"", when in actuality it's made of some specialized polymer alloy that becomes super-heated when enough kinetic energy is applied (like when it's swung into someone's face). Or a mage who is said to ""freeze his foes solid with bursts of ice magic"" is most likely using some sort of liquid-nitrogen based weapon. Then things get even crazier once you bring in more sci-fi technology like anti-grav, teleportation, etc. The possibilities are quite numerous!



While it would be tempting to go overboard with this idea (FLYING LASER VIKINGS!!), I would try to keep things a bit more subtle... well, a bit less over-the-top at least. Things like perhaps the Native Americans being given vaccines against smallpox and other European plagues, or teleportation tech allowing for a safe and reliable means of trade and cultural exchange between Europe and the Far East. Or if things get *really* crazy, the Anglo-Saxons getting their hands on a nuclear device during William the Conqueror's invasion of England! A big focus would be events or ideas coming about well before their time, as well as making subtle changes that lead to major historical events unfolding very differently.



Well, there you have it. That's about as much as I have worked out so far. I know it's not much, but that's why I'm posting it here. I would love for people to ask questions, make suggestions, even poke holes in it! I know that a setting like this would be quite a precarious balancing act, but if it's pulled off well I would see this setting being infinitely fun and fascinating!

1366257223.0,30,self.worldbuilding,1cl2a4,The Six Paths to Power ( the Magic of Ealdgaldor explained),raphael333,38,8,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1cl2a4/the_six_paths_to_power_the_magic_of_ealdgaldor/,"Magic on Ealdgaldor: There are Six Paths to power on Ealdgaldor, five Paths to magic. The Paths are, Warlock, Wizard, Necromancer, Determined, Summoner, and Possesed. All Paths may cast the same types of spell, the difference lay in where the raw magic or Mana, comes from. For the Warlock, power comes from within, his very essence, his soul providing Mana. The Wizard draws Mana from the Ancient Words of Power. The Necromancer’s Mana is drawn from the dead, their spirits providing him with power. The Determined creates Mana out of sheer will, his mind forcing power into being. The Summoner’s Mana is drawn from the spirits of beasts, Nature Herself providing the Summoner with Power. The Possessed’s Mana comes from a spirit bound to it.
___________________________________________________________
Warlock: Of all the Paths, the Warlock is the only one that is born not made or chosen. A Warlock is born with their power, and constantly is expanding it by testing their limits. The Warlock himself generates Mana within his very being, a pool of raw power that grows as the Warlock draws upon it, each use of his power making his available Mana grow in size. But the Path of the Warlock is fraught with danger. If a Warlock overextends himself his own life-force is converted into Mana. Many an arrogant or inexperienced warlock has accidently spent their entire life force attempting a spell beyond them. Of all the Paths, that of the Warlock is the most feared, as a Warlock has access  to a pool of Mana without the training required by the Wizard, or the discipline required by the determined, nor the limitations imposed upon the Necromancer.
___________________________________________________________
Wizard: The Wizard is one of the more common Paths in Ealdgaldor, as anyone can walk it with study and training. The Wizard uses the ancient Words of Power, the language spoken by the Ealdcynd, who forged the world. These Words are intertwined with the wild Mana of the world, and speaking them unleashes this power , shaped by the base word, and the will of he that speaks it. The more fluent one is in the language, and the stronger his will, the less words he must speak. A master can do more with one word than a novice with ten. Speaking the Language of power is taxing to those not of the Ealdcynd, and each Word spoken tires the Wizard. If they over do it, they risk passing out.
___________________________________________________________
Necromancer: Necromancers are chosen by the Spirits of the dead. In return for acting on the behalf of the dead, finishing their business, protecting them from those who would abuse their power, and acting as a bridge and mediator between them and the living, the dead grant the Necromancer Power, allowing him to draw Mana from their essence. The Necromancer is a Path that requires an open mind, and a willing heart. To be a Necromancer is to walk a narrow path between the dead and the living, a keeper of the peace of the Dead, their agent in Life. It is a calling as much as a Path, a duty to the spirits that give them their power. Since the Necromancer’s Mana is provided by the spirits how much he can expend at any given time is determined by how much Mana the spirits are able or willing to give. If a Necromancer offend the spirits or forsakes his duties, he could find himself powerless.
___________________________________________________________
The Determined: Perhaps the most respected Path in Ealdgaldor, The Determined draw Mana to themselves with pure force of will. They simply will the Mana into themselves and use it to power their magic. It requires tremendous willpower, focus, dedication and training to do this. A Determined may spend months, even years training before he can muster enough Mana through willpower for even the simplest of spells. Why would one bother with such a complicated method instead of the much easier path of the Wizard? Once he has mastered his will, a Determined can summon as much Mana as his will can control, with the only limit being the strength of his will. The reward of such a disciplined path is great, and Determined are almost universally looked upon with respect for their strength of will and devotion to the strength of mind required by the Path.
___________________________________________________________
Summoner: Perhaps the most  wild of the Paths, the Summoner receives his Mana from a partnership with the beast spirits and the elemental spirits. The Summoner is either approached by, or approaches one of this spirits, and proposes a partnership. In exchange for protection and acting in the spirits interest, the Summoner receives Mana from the spirit. He physically merges with the spirit, becoming one new being. He is limited by the fact that the Mana he gets is determined by how many spirits he has merged with, and how powerful the spirit was. They take on characteristics of whatever spirit or spirits they have merged with. The original spirit essentially ceases to exist as does the original Summoner as the two merge into a new being.
___________________________________________________________
The Possessed: Feared and misunderstood even more than the Warlock is the Possesed. For too often, a Possessed has no choice in the Path they walk. A Possessed is a being who has merged with a spirit, but remains two whole souls instead of becoming a new being, unlike the Summoner. The Spirit provides the raw Mana the Possessed uses to cast his spells. Sometimes the union is an equal partnership, but an apparent majority of Possessed are controlled by the very spirit that gives them Mana. Like with the Summoner, the amount of Mana the Possessed can call upon is limited to the strength and number of spirits. But unlike the Summoner, the spirit can be cast out or have the tables turned on it, if the one Possessed is of strong enough will.

**Second preface**: If you don't care about the technical details, you can just take advantage of three thousand pre-generated names: [Right here](http://pastebin.com/xdLLzmNF)

I went looking for a nice generator to use for [the world](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/19bn1f/my_attempt_to_merge_worldbuilding_with_programming/) I'm working on, but I was having trouble finding things that didn't create names like 'Bloodied Fort of the High Priestess'. So I made my own. I was inspired by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/19dr3s/i_like_using_earthlike_names_for_places_ie_ones/), which broke names into their component syllables.

Using the link in that thread, I compiled a list of every syllable listed, as well as its 'position'. There are eight positions, 'prefix', 'usually prefix', 'neutral', 'usually suffix', 'suffix', 'infix', 'standalone', and 'usually standalone'.

I set up a few brief rules (After a prefix comes either a 'neutral' or a 'suffix', for example.) and added in a variable for 'brevity', how quickly the program tries to 'finish' the name.

The result is vaguely English/Gaelic/(Irish?) names for villages. I don't think they're all that awful, so I thought I'd share it for everyone to use.

**[The Generator](http://www.mediafire.com/?2benovtq3ntykxz)**

Just launch the executable, and input the number of names you want and the 'brevity'. The lower the brevity, the longer names will end up being. (Non-zero integer values only. Brevity affects length logarithmically. It's really crude, but I just wanted to get the thing working.) There is a very small amount of name-fixing, capitalizing letters and removing double consonants that are never doubled in the English language.

If you're worried about viruses, you can just sample from the pastebin in the 'second preface'.

I have two goals with this program:
1. Make it general-purpose, allowing users to load in generic forms of any language they want from an arbitrary text file.
2. Give users more control over the name generation. Allow 'orcish' names with mild English influences. That sort of thing.

Thanks for the upvotes.**

I've got this magic system that's been in my head for a while. I've always thought it would be a lot of fun to use in a story. This is the first time I've written it down. Feel free to point out bad ideas, and suggest some good ones!

  The magic system in my world is a leftover from the days of powerful mages and magical warfare. Before all of the mage types died out they experimented on their soldiers, granting them abilities to increase their effectiveness in war. Think superhero styled abilities, but in a fantasy setting.

  The soldiers(officers) eventually become the present day nobles. Since large groups of soldiers were often experimented on at once, the people with abilities are divided into Houses based on ability, and into separate Families within the House. I'm thinking that not every family within the Houses will be nobility, but every noble family will come from one of the Houses. Maybe commanding officers become the ruling Families, while enlisted would be equal to merchant-class. I've only got the magic system so far, so I haven't decided how big to make the world, but it'll have to be several kingdoms, just to fit all of the Houses and the general population.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for the House abilities, these are the ideas I have so far:

(I haven't settled on House or ability names, so the names are just the description of the ability)

 * **Strength-shifter** (House of Monster Girl)  - This House greatly increases strength and durability [by shifting into their battle-mode.](http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/98958-95439-monster-girl.jpg) For the durability, they can shrug off a slash from a sword but getting stuck with the pointy bit is effective. They're slightly stronger than most without shifting, and have normal human durability outside of battle-mode.  Monster Girl is obviously the inspiration, but they won't be lifting 60 tons. I'm thinking strong enough to throw around 2,000 lbs easily. They could hit you with your own horse without breaking  a sweat. Strong but slow, they won't be going anywhere in a hurry. Often hired as mercenaries, but make excellent blacksmiths due to their resistance to fire. 

 * **House Coyote** (Animal shifter)- This one is pretty much what it says. They can turn into any animal, but have a limited number of forms to that they can shift to quickly. I'm thinking 4 or 5 forms, that are chosen ritualistically. If they want to shift to an animal they don't have hotkeyed, they need 15-20 minutes to do it. They won't have as much practice in their non-standard form, and won't be able to hold it as long. Scout types and spies, you can usually tell where someone in this House is from based on their animal forms. 

 * **Shadowstep** - This House has the ability to teleport through shadows or darkness, along with night-vision. Shadowstepping would be similar to [the myrddraal power from WoT.](http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Myrddraal#Appearance_and_abilities) They look like any other humans by the way. That link is just for a general idea of what the ability does. Hard to see in the dark, they can cloak themselves in shadow. At night, or in a dark room these guys would be able to teleport anywhere.  During the day, they are limited to shadows. The non-noble Families are often hired as assassins, and assassin prevention.

 * **Speedster** - This House ability is one I'm not really sure about yet. Super speed seems like it would be pretty overpowered. It would have to be watered down. I'm thinking a top speed of 100 mph. They'll have better than human stamina and incredible reflexes and agility, at lower speeds they can keep moving and running for several hours. If they go beyond their limit, they'll lose mobility and have to spend time recovering. Often used as messengers, they're also pretty handy in a fight as long as they don't get tripped up.

 * **Demonic Binding** - This House can summon and bind demons and otherworldly beings to their own bodies. They accomplish this through rituals that only their House can perform. The most common  bindings this House uses are ones that grant them abilities similar to other Houses. They can do this by taking on a demon's form(usually a more powerful demon) or binding multiple weaker demons to their bodies. The latter method is preferred, as it lets the binders retain their own forms and has less risk of the demon taking control. The powers they gain are approximations of the other Houses. They can also bind demons to certain places or objects for a variety of effect that I'm still working on. Most likely going to be sentry and guard type effects. The limit I'm thinking of is that lower level people from this House would only be able to have one binding at once, so only one power at a time until they're more experienced. Similar limit for just binding one super-powerful demon. It takes experience to properly bind the powerful ones without losing control. 

 * **Apollo style, but you don't have to be gay** (unless you're into that) -This is another that I'm feeling kind of iffy about, but I'd like to get some feedback before scrapping it. This House derives its powers from the [sun](http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/565989-apollo1_super.jpg). They aren't going to have nearly the level of power that Apollo has, but he's what inspired the idea. They'll be really strong and durable as long they are exposed to sunlight. At least equals to the Monster Girl House. Without direct sunlight, they burn their power off in about an hour of use. Right now, I'm including flight in this package, but it burns power slightly faster than they can restore it. I think that'll keep them from being too godly. 

 * **Makin Prophet** (edited in)- Precognitive House. This is a very difficult ability to master.

 * **House Conscriptus** (Captain America-type, edited in) - This House is a sort of jack-of-all-trades in this world. Their ancestors were the soldiers that were given general enhancements, not specialty jobs. They're quite strong (600 lbs in one hand is no sweat). Can run faster than an average human but it's not an often used ability. They fantastic reflexes and reaction time. Members are more durable than an average human, but cannot take as much damage as the Monster Girl or Apollo Houses. They heal faster than normal humans as well. 1/2 of the regular human recovery time with major injuries 1/3 time for minor injuries. This house will be one of the bigger, more widespread ones, as there were more general troops than specialty ones in the days of the mages.  

 * **House Basilisk** (edited in) - This House has the ability to stun or hypnotize people. Beginning users of this ability can temporarily paralyze somebody. More experienced users can charm others into doing their bidding. Eye contact is necessary. Ancestors of this House would have been interrogators and prison wardens.

This gives a large detailed world for players to explore in every single direction, made by multiple creative minds and styles. You can make anything on the grid square, be it a castle, an ancient ruin or even a nation that covers several squares on the grid. 
The heart and soul of grid is that the players can go in any direction, and they will find something interesting, strange, unusual or terrifying. Its also a quick and easy way to be creative without having to dedicate a ton of time to anything. You can design one grid square, something simple and small and still contribute to the grid world as a whole. Its also just a place we can all exchange ideas and methods for building rich worlds and locations.
Basically, if I have a couple of people who are interested in adding to the Grid world (even if its just 1 square) then I'll make a subreddit and we can get to making the world. Let me know what you guys think.

When an asteroid is discovered in 1952 on a direct course for Earth, the world's governments fund the development of the Hathorian Fleet to protect the most important leaders and best and brightest students in orbit during the strike, which is estimated to occur in 1987.

The impending cataclysmic strike also forces dramatic increases in spending in space exploration, leading to the development of the Bruno Telescope in 1958, which functions similar to the Kepler today. It soon discovers the planet of Bruno 07b, which shows shockingly similar characteristics to Earth. With little hope of humanity's survival, Bruno 07b is chosen as the Hathorian Fleet's destination and given the name Surrigo, latin for ""rise"".

In 1985, the fleet takes off from launch locations throughout the world, holding 1,500 of the world's most important leaders, scientists, and students. Throughout the 200 year journey to Surrigo, a feud forms between command of the Hathorian mothership and a group of activists, dividing the fleet.

Upon arrival to Surrigo, Hathorian command and their followers make their landing on the continent of Montierro, while the activists land on the islands of Vulcanesia. Due to violent seas, both in terms of conditions and sea-life, paired with the dangerous levels of radiation in the upper atmosphere, travel and communication between the 2 territories is impossible. Isolated and unaware of what the other territory is up to, an overwhelming sense of paranoia sweeps over the people of Montierro and Vulcanesia, who live in constant fear of an invasion by the other.

Back on Earth in 1987, the asteroid strike barely misses, sparing the lives of billions. However, the development of the Hathorian fleet and Bruno Telescope has left the world's governments bankrupt, and economies fail. Deep in a global depression, the world is in a state of constant warfare.

1369062582.0,30,self.worldbuilding,1ep3vu,"The Planetary Empire of Shamash: Its history, culture, and government.",Shagomir,34,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ep3vu/the_planetary_empire_of_shamash_its_history/,"###Overview

Shamash is a vast, warm world, with vast continents and huge oceans. The planet has a radius of 10348 km, and a surface area 260% the size of Earth's. Due to the size of the planet, surface gravity is moderately high at 1.14 G. The planet is a bit warmer than Earth, with an average temperature of 297 K (or 76 degrees Fahrenheit). Shamash also has an axial tilt of 38 degrees, creating a very broad tropical belt and leading to a very even distribution of temperatures and climate. 

Due to the vastness of the continents (there are two large continents over 150 million square km in size, a third at over 100 million square km, and two smaller continents of 54 million and 45 million square km), there are huge areas of desert, scrub, and other wasteland. The shores of the warm oceans are lashed by storms and have quite dense vegetation, but a few hundred km inland the climate is very pleasant and quite habitable, as the intense rains subside and create a more Mediterranean climate. 

Shamash has a day that is 30 hours long, and orbits its primary star Bel in 42 days. Shamash has a small ring known as the Gilgamesh Ring, and a large moon named Sin. Sin is 2200 km in radius and has a thin, Mars-like atmosphere. Bel is an M0V star, and appears as a orange orb in Shamash's sky, more than 25 times larger than the Sun in Earth's sky (it has an apparent diameter of about 2.6 degrees, compared to .5 degrees for the Sun). The reddish light of the star causes the skies on Shamash to have an orange-yellow color. Plant life on Shamash is extremely dark to absorb as much of the weak sunlight as possible, and the seas are a dark blue-green.  

[Map of Shamash](http://i.imgur.com/qbwrL1q.png)

###History

Shamash was founded as the second major Human colony in CY 39 (2863 CE). Due to the political climate at the time, the colonial charter was written so that members of the United Colonial Navy would receive preferred treatment for applications to settle and for land claims. The government was created as a republic. Due to the large area of Shamash, the government was designed so that autonomous provinces could operate independently, working together in a planetary senate for the purposes of large-scale governance. Eventually, this system ended up enfranchising former military members to such a degree that the planet became a militaristic empire in a pseudo-feudal structure. 

In CY 80, during the Hxch Invasion, Star Admiral Alexander ""Zander"" Brinkmann was appointed military governor and was sent to Shamash to organize the defenses of the planet against the invasion. To that end, he organized the provincial militias into the Shamash Planetary Legion and installed himself as the commander-in-chief of these forces. During the chaos at the end of the war, he was able to maneuver the planetary senate into making him the permanent commander of the Legion. Over time, with the support of the military, he fashioned himself into the first Emperor of Shamash, and was first acknowledged as such in CY 86. 

Over his nearly 50-year reign, he created several cultural institutions to solidify his new role. He created a personality cult that grew to become a state religion on Shamash, involving the worship of Shamash's primary star Bel-Shamash (usually known only as Bel), the Benefactors, and the Emperor. He also began a program to create the ultimate soldiers for the legion, including a massive breeding and cloning program. Under his rule, the population exploded from 20 million to 200 million, and he rewarded his supporters by creating new provinces and putting them in power. By the end of his reign in CY 133, he was known as Emperor Bel-Zander. He is considered to be a great hero by the people of Shamash, having ""rescued"" them from the kind of chaos and instability which plagued Amazonia, the third major human colony. 

After the death of the first Emperor, the interregnum lasted for 5 years as various factions vied for power. During this time there were several emperors vying for supremacy, but the conflict was not resolved until the Imperial Senate (now made up of military officials and provincial governors) was forcefully assembled and installed Emperor Bel-Kezar as the Second Sun-Lord of the Empire of Shamash in CY 138. Bel-Kezar reigned for only a few short years before being assassinated, but the protocol for succession had been stabilized. 

Successive Emperors surrendered much of their power to the Imperial Senate, and by the time of the sixth emperor, Bel-Kaan, in CY 190 the Emperor's duties were limited to the nomination of provincial governors and ensuring the stability and integrity of the planetary government. He serves as the ceremonial head of state, and sits on the Admiralty Council. He appoints one representative to the Colonial Senate (the remainder are chosen by the Imperial Senate), and sits on the Colonial Navy's Admiralty Board as the highest-ranking military officer on Shamash. Currently (as of CY 215) the planet is ruled by Emperor Bel-Kezar III, the eighth Emperor of Shamash. He has ruled since CY 213 and is generally well-liked by the Senate and people of Shamash. 

###Culture


Shamash has a diverse culture, with the approximately 1.1 billion citizens spread out across hundreds of separate provinces. Most provinces are city-states, though there are some that are more extensive, especially in the more well-settled parts of the planet. The largest province is the Imperial Seat of Ur, which contains the capital, the Emperor's palace, and the seat of the Imperial Senate. Ur is a large megalopolis of over 110 million people, but only the central district of Ur (along with extensive lands in the outlying area) is part of the Imperial Fief. The rest of the city is broken up into dozens of Urban provinces, which are the domains of some of the oldest and most powerful families on Shamash. 

The people generally enjoy a high quality of life, but society is highly ordered and very authoritarian. The government has a large bureaucratic element, and there are many different intelligence services, secret police, and other organizations dedicated to maintaining order. There is a limited degree of representation available to the citizens, but full citizenship rights depend on military or public service. 

Due to the high gravity on Shamash, most buildings appear to squat heavily on the ground. The Imperial Palace in Ur is a prime example of Shamashan architecture. It is a massive, heavy, jet-black ziggurat that looms over the capital, containing thousands of rooms, courtyards, and gardens to house the Emperor, his servants, and his personal guard. Splayed around the capital are thousands of non-descript housing units, offices, and industrial facilities. The city is built on a large hill, so even though the buildings nearby may be several hundred meters tall, the Emperor's Palace still towers over the capital.

###Military

The military of Shamash, the Planetary Legion, is ostensibly a defensive force. However, they maintain the largest number of troops in the United Colonies, exceeding even the United Colonies Navy in manpower. Their focus is on ground combat, and taking and holding planets. To this end, they have a massive fleet of troop transports, and have participated in many of the UC Navy's interventions on Amazonia and other worlds. Troop numbers across the Legion exceed 20 million individuals, with many more in reserve. 

The main forces of the Legion are equipped to fight in any conditions, from a habitable Earth-like planet to a zero-gravity vacuum environment. The Legion uses standard pulsed laser weaponry and personal armor. Their ships are lightly armed aside from a limited number of escort vessels, and consist mainly of troop ships and transports to support expeditionary forces. They have the capability to drop millions of troops on a planet in a very short period of time and support them nearly indefinitely. 

###Government

Shamash is ruled by the Imperial Senate and the Emperor. The Senate is made up of military officials and provincial governors. Governors may be elected, appointed, or hereditary, depending on the local traditions. Military appointments are made by the Senate with the advice of the Emperor. The Emperor is also appointed by the Senate, as this is also technically a military rank, though his powers as commander-in-chief have been largely legislated away. 

Succession is determined by a vote in the Senate, and there have been several brief but limited wars on Shamash over the succession. Typically violence is limited to the kidnapping of candidates or their families and holding them for ransom, but there have been several wars, especially during the First Interregnum.

Local government of the Provinces is left to the Provincial Governors, and they are largely ruled as autonomous fiefs under traditional rules, some of which stretch back to the original Colonial Charter of Shamash.

The emblem of Shamash is the Sun of Bel-Shamash in Black and Gold on a red field. Shamash is traditionally represented by the colors black and red, while the Emperor uses gold and purple.

I had this idea of making magic really based on the rules of physics. That isn't an expandable force, but instead a force that, with use, transfers from one thing to the other.

*Example*

Using magic to lift a rock, fills the rock with the energy used. The rock can then be ""drained"" for that limited magic power.

**Source of Magic**

Everything has a source, so my idea is that magic comes from the Soul. Everyone is born with a soul, which is a pool of magic. Each time magic is used the soul is damaged. So finding items that are ""charged"" with magic help to restore the soul. The soul also keeps the mind sane. So with a damaged soul comes madness. More use of magic=more soul-damage.

**Death**

If someone dies they travel to a different plain of existence known as the Spiritworld. In this place the world is ruled by magic and there is no physical presence capable of surviving. The body kept the Soul from getting damaged, without it being there, the soul slowly degrades until nothing remains. 

Certain mages are capable of summoning the souls of those that have died, for several reasons. The most common one is that those souls are a great nuclear plant they can drain from. They can perform magic without damaging their own soul. Another reason is to specifically seek out a soul and act as a medium between the world of the living and the dead. 

Two souls in the same body is dangerous. It can equally lead to madness (mixing up their memories, or personalities). So it is not attempted by many.

An older soul is more powerful, but also more unstable. A figure brought back from the dead who has been in the Spiritworld for a long time will have forgotten being human and will only have primal urges. It might overwhelm the medium's spirit. 

There are items that can remove the soul from a living person. These people are known as Gentled, and can act as easy mediums between the world of the dead and the living. 

**Forms of Magic**

This is where I'm still a bit incapable of making this work. 

I want there to be a form of magic that is ""passive"". A Gift, which the people have, but that does not need to be activated.

Then a second form of magic would be to use their soul to influence an element (fire, earth, water, wind).

A third form is still undefined, but it would be something extremely powerful and dangerous.

In my world the season a person is born in influences a lot. Which is why I want to make four types of mages, one for each Season.

SUMMER

Healing others, themselves, healing madness, restoring the soul.

*Element Air*


AUTUMN

1365556927.0,29,self.worldbuilding,1c15v1,Let's discuss lifespan,Asurnasurpal,33,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1c15v1/lets_discuss_lifespan/,"Now, when creating a sentient/sapient species to inhabit your world besides humans, one of the questions that usually needs to be addressed is how long the species lives. Old age and and questions regarding the treatment of people at varying ages fuels many aspects of human cultures, and presumably would fuel many others as well.

For obvious reasons, this is less of a concern in more fantastical or lighthearted settings, where technical details can be glossed over or hand-waved with ""it's magic,"" but in harder or more grounded works, it can be important to get aging just right.

The rule of thumb I use for making races is to match up how physically active a race can be with how old they can live. This helps avoid making races that live for thousands of years and can move in the blink of an eye and stay beautiful forever and have this super-advanced technology and I think you get the idea. You should never have a species comprised almost entirely of Mary S(t)us. Matching up activity with age feels more believable to humans. After all, mice live a year or two, some turtles/tortoises  can live up to well over a hundred, and trees can live several thousand. Even if you have good explanations for *why* the rules are different for you, it'll often sit better on your audience's tongue if they can use rules they're familiar with right off the bat.

If you have a character that's lived much longer than human beings, make them *feel* old. If such a long life is natural for them, they'll view time in a very different way than we do. They'll act slower, and unless their own lives are threatened, they'll see whatever disaster is looming on the horizon as less dire, and more a short-term inconvenience than a great threat. If they care for other races, it's unlikely they'll see them as peers. It's hard to hold people who are so fundamentally different to the same standards you hold yourself.

If the being isn't supposed to live that long, expect a high degree of psychological damage, resultant from seeing their loved ones pass away and things they took for granted about the world (consciously or no) change and/or disappear.

On the other hand, short-lived people should be more concerned about the now. Relatively minor problems would be viewed as considerably more dire, and expect them to make friends faster and fall in love more readily. Also expect them to put a somewhat greater emphasis on their children, as they'll pass away much sooner.

The other big piece of giving a good lifespan for your race regards technological advancement. In the wild, without the use of complex tools (i.e.: tools that must be made with other tools) human beings live to be around thirty, forty at the oldest. With technological advancements, this reaches sixty by the high middle ages in Europe, and currently sits at around the mid to late eighties. (Note: these numbers aren't factoring child mortality.)

The progression from humans without tools to the middle ages represents more than anything else the development of agriculture and ""civilization."" Specialization and a more stable food source ensure that more people can live longer in a smaller area, although they have to work harder and longer than most hunter-gatherer societies. Modern mechanization and improved medicine helps add on even further to the human lifespan.

As we go further into the future, I imagine that medical technology will advance further. Ignoring the possibility of immortality through ""uploading your brain into a computer"" and other such transhumanist possibilities, I like to use the exceedingly arbitrary numbers of 140 years at 2500AD, and 180 at 3000AD.

Of course, none of this should be considered a be-all and end-all ruleset. Everything needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis, and I'm no expert, by any stretch of the imagination.

I'm looking for some feedback. Are there any interesting aspects or important points I left out? Are there any inconsistencies?

**The Feathered**

**Anatomy**

Think of tall people with feathers and with long wings *instead* of arms. It always bugged me that humanoid birds had wings and arms. It doesn't make senese. Well, they also have a sharp beak. At their feet they have strong claws allowing to transport things (e.g. prey). Their wings too have claws but small and weak ones which mostly are just there for scrathing their enemies.

They are able to fly but it's exhausting to do for them all day. They prefer to walk on planes if they aren't in a hurry. So they build short ways/streets but they would never build stairs.

[Drawing](http://i.imgur.com/xmVawHZ.jpg)

**Naming and Language**

The humans call them Farafynet (sg.: Farafyn) which means ""feathered"". In their own languages they call themselves ""ZatPasTapTekTek"". This language is based on the limited sound set they can do comfortably. Some of them learn human languages but they have problems speaking them.

**Living Environment**

They live in the mountains. Most forests are to dense for them and they prefer quite cold and moderately humid areas. They shape their environment building big nest-like constructions out of sticks and stones. Sometimes they use big stones more for important constructions like holy places (think stone henge).

**Society**

They live in small villages of around 50 individuals. There are no specific gender roles so hunting and taking care of the young and the nests are evenly split. But war and leading positions are more often taken care of by the male. Inside this villages they share nearly everything.

In everyday live they do what they are good at to help the village. They might change their work everyday. Adjustment by the village leadership is only sometimes needed. Some special mostly religious positions are inherited.

Every year they group in pairs for mating. These pairs are publically announced and are similar to marriages but just for one year. This can be same pairs every year but they don't have to. Both parents take responsibility for the eggs and later the children. But the village as a whole functions as the family and does parenting.

[If they just choose partners from their own villages, wouldn't this cause genetic degredation? How did real-world mountain villages cope with it?]

**Culture**

Their culture is mostly spoken. They give their stories, poems and songs (think bird songs) to the next generation.

They have a writing system but nearly nobody uses it. It is just there for ethernal laws etc. To write they carve letters in wood or soft stone with their beak.

**Politics**

The villages are mostly self-organized. But they have a government with a monarch in a capital. This government understands itself as single authority of the species and is accepted by most villages. Some human mining towns are associated. The Feathered help with transportion and protecting the towns and get goods back which they can't produce themselves.

Some Feathered don't accept the government and live in independent villages or with the humans in their towns.

**Magical Abilities**

[My magic system is logics based ([see post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/yiem0/how_does_magic_work_in_your_own_world/c5vxu74?context=3)). It's based on an aether-like energy field which all matter interacts with. Magicians can feel and manipulate this field to make the matter react.]

Most of the Feathered are very good at feeling the magic energy. Many are good at low-energy high-precision magic such as telepathy. They bring the magic energy field into vibration which can be felt far away. They represent feelings and emotions in a natural manner. Living creatures recieve these even if they don't generally feel the magic energy. Animals and non-magician sapient creatures can't distinguish these messages from their own feelings. The Feathered use telepathy for long range communication, group manipulation and hunting (e.g. calming the prey).

Every twenty-seven days, the ocean will boil over with monsters, so people clustered together into city-states for protection, with many of these now covering the entire island they were created on.  These city states trade via airships, which are created with cloudwood from floating forests.

My problem is: How do they obtain food?  Traditional fishing is out: the ocean is far too dangerous even not during the twenty-seventh day event.  And the usual farming villages can't exist: not enough protection.  So, what high-magic food ideas has r/worldbuilding come up with for their settings?

My current ideas:

1) Skyship fishing - Airships use large nets and skim close-ish to the water, trawling a large stretch of the ocean with their net before pulling up and pulling their net in.

2) Temporary farming on undefendable islands - People plant large crops on abandoned islands, and retreat to the city prior to the twenty-seventh day event.  Without any fauna on the islands, they're ignored by the beasts coming from the oceans, and are left safe afterwards.

3) Aerial hunting - Airships follow and poach from large flocks of birds.  Might possibly create bigger birds to emulate whaling.

4) Cloudwood foraging - One of the more interesting aspects of cloudwood is that is often (but not always) found as an airborne, floating mass.  Instead of typical soil nutrients, the trees float in semi-contiguous masses at a moderately high altitude, connected by entwined roots and branches.  Other forms of life also inhabit these floating forests, and as such, they can be harvested for fruit and wild game.  (Other forms of cloudwood can be found floating on sea, or occasionally on higher plateaus.)

Around 200,000 C.E. Humanity scarcely survived a knock down drag out galactic war with a species that was very adaptive with DNA and Robotics (Think a combination of the Borg and Zerg). In order to win the war humanity resorted to all sorts of gene manipulation and robotic integration, to an extent where they no longer even appeared to be human.


because of this, Despite being very technologically advanced an ideologically movement lead humanity to reject such measures with an almost religious cult like persistence.


Because of their success, nearly 100% of children make it to adulthood and have children of their own, a very small subset of society is seen as ""too soft"" for not being willing to deal with the hostile alien civilizations they face.


As a result, masses of humans are taken in for ""Multi-generational natural gene therapy"". Several thousand ""soft"" people at a time are taken to ""eden"" planets and left there with nearly no supplies. They have to recreate society from scratch. And after several thousand years survival of the fittest will take over and the appropriate amount of aggression will be breed back into the population by the time they create a stable planet capable of space flight. At which time they will be able to get integrated back into society at large.

Most books that are made specifically about world building do cover topics of interest; culture, warfare, food, religion, magic; but all of these topics are only given brief overviews. 

I'd like to know if anyone has any suggestions for books that are not made for world building but cover these sorts of topics in much greater detail.

For example, I would site *The Golden Bough* by James George Frazer as a good book to check out if your interested in myths, religion, and magic as well as many different cultures. 

Book topics could be from science regarding meteorology or geology to books on aquatic life to the types of food eaten by different cultures during different time periods. 

I think it would just be helpful to have a collection of *source books* to look to when searching for help on different world building topics. 

*I will be adding all suggestions to the list below and hopefully move the list to a more permanent area for future reference to those looking for help. All links are to amazon but these books are sold by many different carriers.*

**Book/Link List**

**World Building:**


* [*World Building (Science Fiction Writing*](http://www.amazon.com/World-Building-Science-Fiction-Writing-Stephen/dp/158297134X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327610355&amp;sr=8-1) by *Stephen Gillett*

* [*The Complete Guide to Writing Fantasy Vol. 1*](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Writing-Fantasy-Vol/dp/1896944094/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327610355&amp;sr=8-5) by *Darin Park* and *Paul Dullemond* - I've read this particular book and it was alright. I enjoyed the different topics covered and hadn't thought of some, food that the people eat, but it was more an example of the watered down topics. I thought it was a good jumping off point, the only issue is the book has some misspellings and bad grammar. Many sources or references are also out of date but nonetheless it is an interesting read. There are more in this series of books that I have not read yet.

* [*Fundamentals of World Building*](http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-World-Building-Jessie-Verino/dp/1603181725/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327610355&amp;sr=8-3) by *Jessie Verino*

* [*The Writers Complete Fantasy Reference*](http://www.amazon.com/Writers-Complete-Fantasy-Reference/dp/1582970262/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327610355&amp;sr=8-7) by *Writers Digest* - My local library had a copy of this and I thought it was a good reference book. I didn't read it cover to cover but picked out the sections that interested me. It had good historical info regarding culture, religion, magic, and other medieval references.

* [*The Language Construction Kit*](http://www.amazon.com/Language-Construction-Kit-Mark-Rosenfelder/dp/098447000X/ref=pd_rhf_se_shvl1) by *Mark Rosenfelder* - Also has a corresponding site that is quite a bit of help as well.

* [*World Builder's Handbook*](http://www.amazon.com/World-Builders-Handbook-Megatraveller-Fugate/dp/B000GBSGZE/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327823217&amp;sr=1-2) by Multiple Authors - I have not read this book and am not sure if it is the correct one. May be a little hard to find with it being so spending while used.


**Historical Reference**

* **Warfare** [*The Art of War*](http://www.amazon.com/Art-War-History-Warfare/dp/081331951X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327611380&amp;sr=8-4) by *Sun Tzu* (translated by others) - I really enjoyed this book and its really short so its a good quick read, but takes some time to really examine and understand.

* **Society Government** [*The Republic*](http://www.amazon.com/Plato-Republic/dp/0872201368/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327611553&amp;sr=1-4) by *Plato* (translated by others) - A very interesting classic book by one of the great early philosophers, Plato. A must read not only for help with world building but for those with an interest in government and society.

* **Society Government** [*Utopia*](http://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Thomas-More/dp/1613822227/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327611654&amp;sr=1-4) by *Thomas More* - Another classic book. This book attempts to create a ""perfect"" society where all are equal. This society that is created is basically a fantasy Communist Society and is a very interesting take on different norms we have today, as well as when compared to the Communism we are familiar with.

* **Culture** [*Guns, Germs, and Steel*](http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393061310/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327610968&amp;sr=1-1) by *Jared Diamond* - I've heard many praise this book while others denounce it. I'd suggest to check out some reviews before purchase.

* **Culture, Food** [*Salt: A World History*](http://www.amazon.com/Salt-World-History-Mark-Kurlansky/dp/0142001619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327610985&amp;sr=1-1) by *Mark Kurlansky*

* **Culture/Warfare** [*Book of Five Rings*](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Five-Rings-Classic-Strategy/dp/0517415283) by *Miyamoto Musashi* - I've read the first few pages so far and its already really interesting. For anyone looking to grab this book quickly there is a copy through the Nook for 99 cents.

Anyway, today I was thinking about the magic system. The world itself is a little bit salvage-punk, where technologies are rediscovered rather than invented. People who would in most settings spend their days inventing instead try and figure out how ancient technologies worked. Blah-blah-blah.

Anyway, magic in this world is pretty much Vancian. Almost anyone can learn spells, it's just very hard. So hard, that most people might eventually manage to learn a single spell. More powerful magicians are able to remember four, five, even six at a time. Once you have used a memorised spell, however, it is gone and you have to start the process afresh.

It's the way of learning spells that I have spent my day thinking of. In this world, unnamed so far, there are devices known as spell-presses. They print out long scrolls encoded in a language of noughts and crosses - kind of like reams of computer code. By deciphering these reams, a wizard is able to memorise and cast a spell. 

However, you can't just press 'print' and wait for the spell to come. You need an appropriate punch-card to activate your machine. Say you want to cast a fire ball, well, you need to go find a fire ball punch card and a spell-press that hasn't printed out a ream for an identical card. A card and spell-press are only compatible for one ream, after which you have to either find a new card or press.

I thought that this made my magic system a little more interesting, as people would guard their cards and presses jealously whilst also being forced to go out and hunt other devices. I think there would only be a few hundred spell-presses left in the world, making competition high.

What do you think? Is it too specific? Any major holes you can see in the system? I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_1h307n,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1h307n/care_to_hear_of_my_magic_system/,

It is still in use, though much of it is now unexplored due to cave ins. Despite this it remains the largest contiguous man-made structure on the planet.

Kaldun is thought to have been constructed between seven hundred to eight hundred years ago by the Grand King of Leis as a tomb for his family. According to texts from the time, after the Grand King's death the tomb was vastly expanded, from tens of square metres to close to its current size. The reasons for this are unfortunately lost to history but it is known that those workers that lost their lives in the construction were interred in an undiscovered area marked on old maps as *Kalhil*^1 .

This is also when the shadowy creatures known too as the Kaldun appeared in the tomb. The Kaldun manifest as huge, robed shadows. Their connection with their namesake is unknown.

Five hundred years ago, the tomb began to be used as a place to bury the bodies of executed criminals, the idea being to deny their spirits the chance to escape to the heavens.

Two hundred years ago the tomb was expanded again to its current size by Emperor Meit III of the Meitan Empire, shortly before the Empire was expelled from the area. This was to make up for ground lost by cave ins. Officially, the reason given was that the purpose of this was to let the local culture continue burying the executed as they had done for hundreds of years. Unofficially, it was to allow the Empire's wizards the chance to search for a supposed rift in space at the centre of the tomb. Whether it was discovered or not is also unknown.

Today, the original burial site of the Grand King of Leis is lost. It is most likely that his chamber was repurposed, with some claiming the antechamber immediately inside the entrance is the original Kaldun. Work continues to excavate the tomb, hindered only by the presence of the Kaldun species, who, whilst peaceful, appear to attempt to obstruct exploration too deep.

At last count, the tomb holds twenty three thousand bodies. This is estimated to be less than a fifth of the total number actually buried there and far less than the total ever buried.

---

*Graves in Meitar (don't confuse with the modern Meitan culture) and then Reian culture are typically left open, at least nominally, in order to allow the spirit to leave, Kaldun being an exception.

^1 From *kal*, from *Kaldun*, and *hil*, meaning a special or reserved area.

The game is simple. I will give you an item and it's description and usage in a setting, all entirely without preparation. I will then list **three** describing words for someone else to use in an item. I will be using [this random word generator](http://randomwordgenerator.net/index.php) to generate these words. However, the words may be all selected by choice. The goal of this game is creativity and entertainment. These items can be for any setting or time period. Here we go. 

Remember, these three words were are the first results provided through a random word generator: 

**spoons - instructed - quantification**

*The silver spoons of an unnamed petty god*

These silver *spoons* are found in a small chapel hall within a mysterious kingdom far away. The chapel once bared the name of a petty god, but history has since forgotten his or her name. The spoons are polished brightly, reflecting any and all light that strike them. They are held behind locked doors within a display case of velvet. 

The silver spoons, when struck at the perfect pitch, are said to summon this petty god from his or her realm of existence. It is said that this petty god will give the one that struck the spoons a very specific, random task to undergo. If the wielder of the spoons does as *instructed*, regardless of the moral implications of the deed, the hold of the spoons is allowed the multiplication of any given item. The *quantification* of this multiplication is as random as the deed provided by the petty god. It is believed, however, that some have become vastly rich using these silver spoons of an unnamed petty god. Regardless, few have struck the spoons in many generations. Some claim it is nothing more than a fairy tale meant to bring visitors to this out of the way chapel. 

It is still unsure to the current holders of the spoons if each spoon must resonate a certain pitch in a certain order to summon this petty god or if any of the spoons may be struck at the correct pitch. Many believe the initial is true. 

And the next three random words are:

## Last Week

Last week we talked about justice and imprisonment in the ""Prison System"" challenge. /u/ndotson's [Prison City of Fankila](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1aquy2/weekly_challenge_prison_system/c8zyc11) isn't exactly a nice community to move to or anything, but that didn't stop you voting his submission up for the popular vote. The judge's award goes to /u/Deightline's submission about being [exiled beyond the wall](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1aquy2/weekly_challenge_prison_system/c8zzroi), where the convicts face the possibility of being devoured by a black beast from within the caldera lake.

## This Week

War! Huh. What is it good for? Typically, conquering new land and resources. Er, ah, I mean ""absolutely nuthin'"".

Let's talk about ""Warfare"" in our worlds. Why are wars fought? Are they always just for conquering land, or can they be punitive or have other motivations? What events or incidents in your world's history have sparked wars? Are wars fought conventionally, with open combat, or are wars often attrition-based, guerrilla actions, or insurgencies? Or are wars even more unconventional, and instead of violence and death they are fought with economic means, or religious, or social?

The deadline for this challenge will be **Wednesday, April 3rd**.

## Next Week

What is a dwarf? A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry. Well, let's examine them more in-depth in next week's challenge, ""Remix: Dwarves"".

There are a number of common aspects we ascribe to dwarves: short and stocky, beardy, alcoholic, stalwart fighters, industrious, greedy, often armed with axes or hammers.

A few days ago, /u/Valafaar posted a link to [an old M:tG discussion of dwarf design](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1aymqv), talking about likely adaptations a race of dwarves might have if they lived in tight tunnels underground for generations. In Dwarf Fortress, dwarves can become ""cave adapted"", that is, they become so used to the dark confines of their underground fortresses that the next time they emerge into the open again they can become ""sun sick"".

But what if your dwarves didn't live in subterranean tunnels? What about desert dwarves or sea dwarves or forest dwarves? Or what if they did live in tunnels, but in this case the tunnels are in the honeycombed asteroids that are home to space dwarves? If your dwarves are industrious and greedy for gems and precious metals, *why*?

**Population Sizes of Tribes (aboriginal/iron age)**

small = 500p,
moderate = 1000p,
large = 5000p,
huge = 10 000p

**Density Sizes of Tribes (aboriginal/iron age)**

low = 0.2p/km2,
average = 0.7p/km2,
high = 1.8p/km2,
v.high = 3.5p/km2

**Population Sizes of Tribes (byzentine/germanic)**

v.small = 1000p,
small = 10 000p
moderate = 25 000p,
large = 40 000p,
huge = 100 000p

**Density Sizes of Tribes (byzentine/germanic)**

v.low = 4.4p/km2,
low = 9.6p/km2,
average = 27.5p/km2

For example:

An average moderately sized, average density aboriginal tribe would hold 1429km squared which is 38km across (if in a square) which takes 6.8h to cross by walking at 5.5km/h.

Very useful for me, I hope this is useful for you too!

EDIT: The numbers I have given you cover a wide variety of cultures and times. I have rejigged the numbers and labelling for more clarity.

""Aboriginal"" representing either iron age germanic, or very low tech-unwesternized true aboriginal cultures like the american indians or african tribes... Realistically a 10k (aboriginal) population would be 'v.high ' density, and be more of a town than a tribe. Of course v.high density is relative, as population densities are far more dense in the last 5 centuries (modern) than the first millennia.

The byzantine/germanic numbers explain a 'setting' that is very different to a much sparser aboriginal 'setting'.

""Byzantine Age"" is about the 300-1300s where germanic and arabic populations would have been far more dense because of farming and town making... evidence shows highly dense populations only started appearing much later.
Germanic tribes may still only hold an average area of 900km2, 30km wide area but with their higher densities they all reside in *towns* of 8 500 - 25 000 people. This is still considered a tribe because it is not a state. When there are tribal populations greater than 25 000 it is likely because many 'clans' of 1000 - 10 000 people are united together to create a greater group that is then still considered a tribe.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,1363130551.0,,,True,t3_1a4tvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1a4tvl/some_research_into_tribal_and_medieval_population/,

Because of this, I've been forced to detail parts of the military in specific, going to great lengths to define everything I can for the purposes of the book. The military ranking system I've been working on is as follows:

The lowest part of the command chain is made up of thousands and thousands of 'grunts,' these being the lowest of authority in the army. While trusted to make their own decisions in battle, they still are generally ordered around by a higher figure, and are not processed as thoroughly as the other ranks. They are often conscripted as well.

The next step up the ladder is the Executor. These units act as drill sergeants, military police, and squad commanders. They have a great amount of authority in the military, though they are low in rank.

After them come Templar, practically generals in relation to U.S. army ranking. These hulking behemoths, clad in heavy armor, oversee entire battles, and often take part in them.

Justifier are next, often trained the most out of any units in the military. They do not have authority over the Templars' actions, but they are occasionally given discreet, direct orders from the Emperor, and can circumvent the High Commanders in power.

Fleet commanders are another step up, overseeing various armies all at  the same time. They can be found in command ships, and are extremely uncommon on a battlefield. Fleet commanders have jurisdiction over the Templar, but not the Justifiers.

the High Commander is the highest in rank in the entire Imperial military, his word being law beside the Emperors'. He is in control of all armies planetside and in space, and can add or remove units from a system on a whim.

other than that I don't really have any more ranks, the system isn't really governed that way. They generally promote people when they need a replacement, or when a higher-ranking official decides that they should be moved up. It's usually not based on skill, though for the High and Fleet commanders it is, solely.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_18zchx,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/18zchx/so_im_coming_up_with_a_military_hierarchy_and_i/,

1359959744.0,28,self.worldbuilding,17usgd,A good book for anyone interested in building religion in their world: 'Religion in the Making',Arsonade,28,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/17usgd/a_good_book_for_anyone_interested_in_building/,"[Book/e-book](http://books.google.com/books?id=nZKOeHtW2IAC) here, or [Free online version](http://theology.co.kr/whitehead/religion/) here.

The aim of the book is to provide an account of how religion emerges and develops in history. It mainly focuses on the history and philosophy of religion, but some parts read almost like an instruction manual on how to build a religion from the ground up. I can't myself say that I could sign on to the history and philosophy as presented wholesale, but I've found the ideas to be extremely helpful in worldbuilding.

To give one example, Whitehead describes four progressive stages in the development of religion: Ritual, Emotion, Belief, and Rationalization, and he describes 'ritual' as emergent from evolution (similar to the concept of [Memes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) )

&gt;  Ritual goes back beyond the dawn of history. It can be discerned in the animals, in their individual habits and still more in their collective evolutions. Ritual may be defined as the habitual performance of definite actions which have no direct relevance to the preservation of the physical organisms of the actors ... ritual is the stimulus to emotion, and an habitual ritual may diverge into religion or into play, according to the quality of the emotion excited.

On this account then, the origin of a religion is ritual, and ritual itself emerges out of instinctual habits rendered vestigial through evolution. In regards to world-building then, this represents a way to develop a race's religion directly out of its evolutionary origins. Take the habitual instinct of [Jumping in Dolphins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin#Jumping_and_playing) for instance; should dolphins continue to evolve in terms of intelligence, such activity might become vestigial; it would no longer have direct relevance for the dolphin to its preservation. The act of jumping over the waves would then be a 'ritual' of these intelligent dolphins which could potentially develop into belief, myth, and eventually religion: perhaps a belief regarding the 'ocean' of air above the ocean of water, a myth surrounding dolphins which swim above the waves, and a religion expressing faith in salvation through flight. The example is simplified; taking other parts into account would allow these transitions to be much more nuanced (and interesting), but this should illustrate that the ideas here can serve as a method for building beliefs and religions which really grow right out of, and right alongside the races of your worlds.

At any rate, I hope you all find this interesting; I'm currently working on a world derived almost directly from the book and I felt I couldn't keep the resource to myself anymore.",,False,self,t5_2rd6n,False,,,True,t3_17usgd,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/17usgd/a_good_book_for_anyone_interested_in_building/,

41 pages plus a world map.

I worked on it by first making the world map, then randomly selecting a city I wanted to map out (the first one I did was the Bridgewatch Base). I would continue mapping out cities and detailing the local culture, government, economy, etc. until I got bored then move on to a new place to map out. Once all the major cities in a country were mapped out that meant I could make a ""country section"" with a zoomed-in map of the country and some notes about the overall culture, government, economy, etc.

There is a lot more information just in my head about the nations and their religions and societies (mostly about the eastern continent, Sothor).

The goal of the project was to make a world large enough to support realistic histories and complex enough to seem authentic. The basic theme was essentially ""authenticity"" as what I hoped to achieve in the end was a world that was consistent and realistic in almost ALL aspects, including geology (plate tectonics, landforms, etc.), weather (currents, jet streams), sociology (movement and blending of cultures, governmental structure, trade relationships), architecture (castle design, city design, temples, monuments). The only exceptions I intended to allow myself are the presence of fantasy races (elves and orcs and whatnot), the road that encircles the planet, and fictional flora and fauna (albeit limited within reason, avoiding ridiculous fantasy tropes like giant bugs/vermin and absurd plant-life).

The reason I'm stopping development is that I realized that I've departed these goals and made quite a few departures from logic and mistakes in documentation (cities entirely contained in castle walls, arranged into neat angular sections? wut), the largest of which is the road running straight across my map, completely ignoring the fact that this stuff has to exist on a spherical planet. I spent some days attempting to plot it onto a map projection but was ultimately unable to retain the geography and climate areas ingrained into the already-extant documentation of the world.

Do they bury their dead, or lay them out to sea? Fire them from a cannon at the moon?



In my world, the Woden are an ethnoreligious group with a well-known habit of cannibalizing their dead in massive, ceremonial feasts. They believe the spirit can only continue on after death if returned to where they came from, and they firmly believe they did not come from the planet they live on.

A core tenet of their religion is that the world is actively hostile to the presence of humans; corpses *do* have an annoying habit of reanimating and attempting to live their life as if they were still alive, and the Woden see this as evidence that the world is rejecting them, even in the afterlife. As a result, the only thing *like* a human in this world is another human, and so that is where they must be buried.

Funeral Feasts are big spectacles, held at various intervals according the size of the community; all present must eat at least one bite of fallen comrades, and so bodies are preserved in salt until enough corpses have amassed to feed all who will be present at the Feast. Larger cities have been known to serve over one hundred corpses at their Feasts, prepared according to the dead's wishes. Honey-glazed is a particular favorite.

1372757434.0,27,self.worldbuilding,1hhkb1,A religion from my world - The Steel Path,Kaurne,30,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1hhkb1/a_religion_from_my_world_the_steel_path/,"The Steel path is an enlightenment based, rather than worship based, religion. It has no ‘god’ to speak of. Rather, it is said that the followers of the Steel Path seek out the God within themselves.

Simply put, the Steel path teaches that all humans are composed of two different spiritual parts. There is the samra, the self, which is the emotion, desire and will of the individual, and there is also the umra, the connection that links an individual with other individuals.

The Steel path is the means of achieving the co-ordination of these two. It teaches that the samra is the more important part. Having no umra makes us beasts, but having too much umra makes us each other’s slaves.
The key balance is expressed thusly – while each person may benefit from another’s help, they should never require it.  A Steel Path adherent strives to not rely on the aid of others. Admittedly, all people exist in a society (and this means having some umra) and all people who have a trade rely on other people as part of an exchange of goods. This, however, is not the same ‘relying’ as it is to have someone else provide for you.

This distinction makes the Steel Path a reasonably egalitarian religion. It recognises that the buying or selling of goods is a contract between (theoretically, at least) equals, each of whom is able to engage in this deal by their own self-reliance and industriousness.

Samra is the key aspect of the Steel Path. It is, in essence, a striving for industriousness, creativity, wisdom or knowledge. An adherent of the Steel path must work to achieve enlightenment here on earth and thus in the afterlife. Through work, the adherent breaks the bonds that hold him down – dependence on others. By gaining self-reliance, an adherent becomes spiritually free, allowing them to break the chains that hold him to the world when he dies (i.e. reincarnating him) and achieve enlightenment.

The Steel path is reasonably flexible in that it does not teach what our goals should be, only that achieving them on our own is the key part. Whether that goal is purchasing a house, courting a woman or rising through military ranks, it is vital that an adherent achieves it through their own ability. Indeed, it is stressed that it is better not to advance than to advance with help. Even if you do not advance on your own merits now, you might do so later, or achieve other victories. Getting help, however, taints all future victories.

One place where the Steel path requires deeper thought is on the subject of children who, obviously, cannot be self-reliant. The Steel Path dictates that, for parents, it is a worthy goal to bring up children to know the Path and thus be ready to achieve Enlightenment on their own at a later date. To do that, they must aid the children until they are fully formed and grown. 

Once they are, the Sahabwa ceremony is undertaken, and the parents must (theoretically, anyway) cease helping the now-adult in any way but through giving advice. The ceremony does not have a set age at which it is undertaken – it can vary between the age of 12 and 20, although it is usually taken at age 14-15.

Essentially, every material contains a specific composition of 6 different elements. These elements are water, earth, fire, air, aether, and vacuos(looking for a better name for this). The first four are simple enough, as they are the regular classical elements. The last two, aether and vacuos are a bit more complex. Aether was discovered after the first four and represents a certain type of ""magical"" energy. Very soon after its discovery, almost all alchemical invention and innovation was based around aether as its source of power. Vacuos was discovered last and completes the modern alchemical theory. Vacuos represents a specific emptiness in a substance. In simplest terms, it is the tendency of a substance to accept other essences and in fact is just as important to alchemy as aether. The 6 elements have very well defined relationships with each other as shown in this very hasty and poorly drawn ""[diagram](http://imgur.com/RDikPNW)"" I made in MS paint.  Black lines represent a strong connection between elements. For example, fire and air are both strongly connected to aether because they are energetic and ""hot"", and water and earth are connected strongly to vacuos because they are able to accept energy and are ""cold"". Red lines represent a cancellation reaction, in which a ""lower"" element consumes all of its counterpart ""higher"" element. Water quells fire, earth blocks winds, and vacuos absorbs aether. Elements connected by a red line cannot form a substance by themselves.  Grey lines are weak connections which show that two elements can coexist in a substance by themselves but are not strongly connected. 

Everything in the world is comprised of a specific ratio of all of these elements. For example, water and air comprise steam, with there being slightly more air than water. Ice is comprised of water, earth, and a small amount of vacuos. 

The goal of almost all alchemists is to find a material that exists in the absolute center of the circle mentioned above. This material, the philosopher's stone, was initially thought to be impossible to create with the discovery of Vacuos, but due to recent research involving mercury, it is now believed to be theoretically possible but very difficult to produce and maintain in the physical world. 

So what are your thoughts on this system? Are there any glaring flaws which need to be addressed in order to make this system more logical? I attempted to build it around the style of thinking of Greek philosophers and medieval alchemists.

At some point in the not very distant future, someone begins messing around with magic--perhaps in the form of superscience, perhaps as Ancient ritual, who knows. The point is, magic is awoken--but magic here is fed by the Void. It starts eating away at the world the more it is used.

The setting in which I want to tell my story is a large city--perhaps New York--which has been cut off from the rest of the world by the Void. They have been on their own for at least a few decades, probably longer--I don't know yet if I want there to be people who can remember a time before the city was cut off. If so, it should be a distance memory. Magic use is forbidden outside of very special circumstances, mostly powering devices the city needs to stay alive and catching other magic users.

My issue is that I need to figure out what this city would realistically end up as if it were cut off from the rest of the world. A few things I can already tell--there would be no cell phones, for example, but people might be able to hook up landlines. It is unlikely that their reserves of fossil fuels would last for long, so there probably aren't cars still in use. The power grid would still be in place, and they could probably provide electricity either via solar power or limited magic usage.

But, what about food? How much land space would a city the size of New York need to provide food for itself? How many farmers? How many bullets and guns would be inside the city, and how capable would people be of making more? What things do we take for granted that would disappear without the outside world?

(xpost /r/urbanfantasy)",storieswithbears,29,2,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1a7c1r/modern_earth_fantasy_what_prevents_the_masquerade/,"Worldbuilding seems to focus mostly on medieval-ish fantasy worlds, but I hope you guys can help me out with my contemporary fantasy setting.

---

For a long time I've been considering a sort of New Weird/urban fantasy setting based on the following premise: A long time ago, Earth was connected to numerous other worlds by a series of ""doors"" of unknown origin. The inhabitants of the other world were our beasts and beings of legend—elves, jinn, vampires, garuda, etc. etc. They were able to travel between worlds using the gates whenever they wanted, until one day when every gate suddenly closed at the same time. Any of the creatures who happened to be Earthside when the gates closed were now stranded here forever, essentially refugees who had to adapt to their new home.

Think *Stargate* with some China Miéville and Jim Butcher thrown in for inspiration, maybe.

The story is set on modern day Earth, but there are two key differences, neither of which the average human is aware of:

1) There is a sizeable population of supernatural critters (many of them quite inhuman) lurking under their very noses.

2) Magic exists, although in a gritty way—not a wand-and-spellbook sort of thing. Aside from the fact that it allows you to do things from a distance, it otherwise operates according the laws of physics (e.g. no energy can be created or destroyed, only converted). And it's more like a tool than anything. For example, unless you have an advanced degree in neurobiology, trying to magically brainwash someone would end very poorly. Think ""performing brain surgery with a three-foot-long rusty scalpel while drunk and blindfolded"".

Herein lies my problem: **On a modern-day Earth where magic must operate (more or less) according to the laws of physics, would it be possible to maintain the [""Masquerade""](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade) that hides the supernatural world from everyday people?**

The more I think about it, I can't see how it would be possible. Spy satellites, YouTube, the constant ability to take photos and record video with your phone, sites like Reddit that allow people the world over to share any sort of strangeness that they encounter … Even the most carefully hidden society would slip up eventually. **Can anyone think of any good justifications or realistic ways for the supernatural to remain hidden?**

And part two of the question: **What are some reasons that the supernatural community would even *want* to stay hidden?** The obvious one would be that humans outnumber them and have guns. But a leprechaun could use an AK-47 just as well as a person, and then fry their asses with a fireball for good measure. And humans are constantly trying to dominate one another, so why shouldn't an army of power-hungry leyaks expose themselves, declare war on humanity, and start rounding up pregnant women so they can eat their fetuses?

Even if (by some miracle) the supernatural world was able to escape the gaze of spy satellites and the nasties were forced to keep the peace and not reveal themselves, there would still be the occasional political zealot with nothing to lose. All it would take is a single YouTube video of a group of Japanese tourists being eaten, or a journalist suddenly growing bat wings during the State of the Union address. Then the jig is up.

**TL;DR: In today's age, how and why would Muggles remain in the dark about the supernatural?**

And does the premise sound at all interesting? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

(as a small introduction to my galaxy, the main source behind alot of history in my galaxy are the Progenitors, an ANCIENT galactic race that for the sake of their extreme interest in biology, muddled in the primordial pools of thousands of planets in the galaxy before their ultimate untimely demise)

5) The Ghoshekka Empire: This race acts as one of the predominant nemesis in the galaxy due to their (current) nature. Long ago, this race was helped in their quick evolution by the progenitors, and also by the tidal nature of their planet caused by 4 moons that crossed at irregular intervals (an aspect that also heavily affected their religion). Long before most other civilizations came to be, this civilization was far advanced in technology. But they were not destructive at this time. They were, in fact, once a beautiful race of immaculate in appearance beings, who's language, at the time, would have been attuned to graceful singing. However, the curse of their planet (and position in the galaxy) was that resources were scarce and hard to come by, and in their thirst for knowledge, soon used up almost all of their resources. In an act of desperation for new resources, they invented the Athganajte Emmilithejken, ""the cannon of the heavens"", to blast away at heavenly bodies and collect the precious resources within. This huge, monolithic structure, reaching miles upon miles into the sky, was, like all of their buildings and tools, outwardly artistic and beautiful, with murals, designs, and archways that would make the vatican look like a slum built by neanderthalic hobos. Their first shot was, tragically, at one of their own moons, more of a test than a true demonstration of its power. But in their desperation, they failed to calculate that the destruction of one of their four moons would throw the planet of axis and into disarray, killing millions in the process. Now even more desperate, they fired at the nearest planet in their system, sealing their fate. The power of the cannon had now effected their core, causing chaotic eruptions on the surface, killing many more millions than the devise was meant to safe. Sent into a dark age, the people became warring for the now rare resources, and devolved into a society of war and enslavement, only out of the necessity of their people. But they still possessed their once awing technology, and so they expanded into space, with only one thing on their minds: conquest. In one of the fastest expansions in galactic history, they scoured their sector of the galaxy, enslaving hundreds of races and conquering thousands of planets. In a great case of galactic irony, their home atmosphere, forever changed by the Athganajte Emmilithejken, caused them to adjust to breathing a powerful toxin, thus making normal atmosphere unbreathable to them, and so, they all dawned horrific in appearance breathing masks, which caused them to be called the same thing, although in different languages, by all their slave people: Pale Demons.

4) The Iiee'Joii: The name of this civilization is not some attempt at making an alien-sounding name, but actually an attempt to spell their language in our terms, which is, unlike how our languages are dictated by vowels, consonants, and the combination of the two, theirs is dictated by tones, volumes, pitches, reverberations, and the length of their vowels (creating a sound ironically similar to what we know as ""dubstep""). This race was fairly non-humanoid in appearance, with gray skin, short, bulbous bodies with stumpy arms and legs, coming to ends in 4 digits, but with long, slender, 3ft necks that reached their oblong heads, with vertical slits for mouths, having multiple flaps within for speech. Despite their outwardly advanced appearing technology, this race was TRULY barbaric, having only one advancement in science in mind: war. Their only true technologies revolved around weapons, war, and vessels to deliver war to other species. They even still dawned armor of iron, and knew little about agriculture, having always gotten what they needed from ""weaker"" civilizations, and had no need for art or music of any form. Encountering this race was imminent doom for whichever civilization they found, except for in one bizarre turn in galactic history....

3) The Shishikara: This race is actually the descendants of humans (or what in this galaxy we equate to humans, being biologically identical to us), lost long ago in a sleeper ship to find new planets. Their ship may still be found as a large spire sticking out of the ground in the middle of their capital city. The planet they landed on long ago, however, was the remnants of a botanical and medicinal ""greenhouse"" created by the progenitors long ago, and had long become overgrown and jungle-like in appearance. The majority of plant-life on this planet, although mostly medicinal also, were mostly psychoactive to most species of the galaxy. Everything from stimulants, depressants, psycho-actives, to painkillers existed in a unique ecosystem on this planet. This, ultimately, altered the appearance and culture of the humans that landed on the planet. Forever affected by the nature of their flora, the people became tribal and spiritual, commonly experiencing great visions, and feeling amazing pleasure and happiness from the plants around them. Of course, their world was quickly found by many other galactic civilizations in their sector, but they quickly became a hub of medicinal-based commerce and tourism in their sector, with many realizing the medicinal and recreational benefits of their countless plants on the planet. It wasn't long, however, before their glowing-green planet drew the greedy eyes of the Iiee'Joii (being located in the same sector as them), and they sent fleets to secure the planet as their own. Typically, the Iiee'Joii send a landing squad to tell the locals that they had been conquered by the Iiee'Joii, and any resistance would be met with the unyielding force of their military. However, the ""ambassadors"" were surprised and confused when, instead of cowering in fear or pointing weapons back at the invaders, the Shishikara began to dance. Unbeknownsed to the Iiee'Joii, their language came off as a trance-inducing music to anyone effected the typical drugs and medicines of the Shishikara. Dumbfounded, the Iiee'Joii held off massacring the locals just long enough for the Shishikara to bring them an offering of herbs and medicines, which the Iiee'Joii quickly accepted as an offer of surrender by the people. However, in the drug-induced state of the herbs and medicines, the Iiee'Joii quickly realized why the Shishikara were dancing, overcome suddenly by a new feeling of joy and happiness, and most of all harmony, brought on by the plants. Word quickly spread the the rest of their empire, and millions flocked to Shishika (the planet of the Shishikara) to experience this new phenomena. Overcome with joy, the Iiee'joii quickly gave up any plan of conquering, and instead formed an everlasting alliance of the two peoples, fueled by their mutual new-found love of eachother.

2) The Jiji: The Jiji are in-fact not the blue-skinned humanoids that everyone else sees, but are actually a tiny dark-green slug that long ago took over the beings that everyone else sees today. Hailing from a mysterious asteroid from some mysterious homeworld, possibly from outside the galaxy itself, these parasitic slugs soon took over the planet of these poor beings, burrowing in a painful manner deep into the skulls of their victims, attaching to their cerebral core, and quickly taking control of all functions of the being, making them slaves to their new masters. The possessed soon would hunt down the other members of their species, forcing them down and planting their offspring into their minds, further possessing the rest of the race. Once a mindless race of brain-slugs, the Jiji now had the intelligence of their hosts at command, and soon developed a new society in the bodies of the original dominant species of the planet, constructing a small empire of a few planets. Coincidentally, they no longer found the need to take control of other species, since they now had hosts aplenty from the species they now dominate. The Delta Confederation (The central government of the galaxy, acting in a way like the republic of the Star Wars Galaxy, but only encompassing a fraction of the galaxy), although disturbed by the presence of this race, soon learned that the Jiji were now fairly peaceful and were willing to trade with other nations, since they no longer had the goal of assimilation, and so the Confederation tolerates their existence, and has even made treaties with their civilization. Most, however, fear the gruesome nature of the Jiji, theorizing how more could come from the fringes of space and dominate the galaxy. But, for now, they exist peacefully.

1)The Gruagh: In on of the strangest occurances in galactic history, the Gruagh exist not as a civilization, but rather the remnants of a once-small civilization of a few planets in a far off sector of the galaxy. Perhaps once a thriving inter-planetary civilization, a bizarre, cataclysmic event destroyed this once (possibly) great society, who's demise is only now speculation in the minds of modern scientists, historians, and explorers. To any outsiders, these planets appear uninhabited from a distance, but any mineral-scanners would quickly pick up that these planets are quite inhabitable and resource-abundant. Upon closer observation, one could observe the ancient ruins of a once-great metropolis on the surface of many of their planets. But, the original explorers who landed on these planets to observe them found something far-far more gruesome and horrific than they had EVER imagined, and most, save a mere handful (And I literally mean maybe 5 out of 1,000's) of survivors in many, MANY incidents of encounter, perished within hours of landing on their surfaces. To the horrors of ALL who landed on the surface, one would soon discover that some form of zombie apocalypse destroyed the denizens of this once-thriving civilization. No one truly knows how, as all technology had long ago lost all power and were useless, and those remaining writings were untranslatable due to no one knowing their language, so only speculation as of to what happened exists. Nobody knows what caused it, be it virus, radiation, disease, or even chemical warfare created by some wayward mad-scientist, but all that is certain is that it happened. Nobody even knows how the infection spread between the planets, although most speculate the disease must incubate for some time, allowing infected survivors to have boarded escape ships to the other colonies, ultimately causing the demise of the whole civilization. The Gruagh are gruesome, ugly creatures, who's skins have fallen away over possibly hundreds or thousands of years of decay. But the Gruagh are undying, as they require no real sustenance to survive. However, they are extremely hostile to anything not Gruagh, and will attack on site, regardless of harm or danger. They are exceptionally hard to kill, seeing that all metabolistic and bodily function has ceased, making only the central nervous system vital to function. As soon as one finds a non-Gruagh, they call their brethren, and quickly swarm any survivors, eliminating all targets in an efficient and violent manner, overwhelming with sheer strength and number.

Anyway, I'd rather not build continents right away, I have a *very* rough idea of what I want the world to look like, so much that it could change at any time.

In essence, my question is this: Are there any pitfalls or traps I can run into while building my world outwards? I can't *think* of any myself, but then again, the absolute basics I've learned so far seem rather simple to me: have your rivers start near mountains and follow the elevation down, the equator is the hottest part of the world and it gets cooler as you get away, at least on planets with one sun.

Dreg was a creation of the deities dueling for control of the planet, and charged with leading the armies to wipe out the human population (also creations of the gods, but an experiment that got out of control). Dreg, feeling a close kinship to humanity, rebelled against his orders and lead a human army against the superior Godborn, led by General Sander. The two armies met at the forge, a giant volcano where the gods forged the Godborn and, originally, the humans. Sensing the defeat his army was near, Dreg threw himself into the volcano, and the resulting eruption wiped out most of the forces in the area, including Sander, and spewed ash into the sky, permanently darkening the area. A pyrrhic victory. The destruction of Sander's forces allowed the human reserve armies to make a push back and reclaim lost territory. 

The war continues to rage, but the victory at Dreg's Peak renewed morale and evened the playing field.

Also check out the /r/RPG weekly challenge administered by [rednightmare](http://www.reddit.com/user/rednightmare)!

## Last Week

We got some mouthwatering submissions for our challenge of Culinary Anthropology, the study of food across cultures. Once again the popular vote goes to bjornfeuer; I could go for some [salt-encrusted cheese and sink bread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/xjib8/rworldbuilding_challenge_culinary_anthropology/c5mybfs)! It was a tough pick between alexanderwales and denarii for the judge's award, but alexanderwales narrowly wins it with his [essence-bound beef](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/xjib8/rworldbuilding_challenge_culinary_anthropology/c5n3zzj), using magic to infuse herbs and spices directly into the living meat of a cow.

## This Week

Most of our worlds have one or two regions that are extremely harsh environments, whether they're too hot, too cold, too dry, too windy, or too extreme in any respect. But harsh environments breed hardy people. Tell us all about how a culture might adapt to survive and even thrive in an extreme environment.

As a reminder, the r/WB challenge is genre-neutral, so genres other than fantasy are perfectly welcome! I have yet to see anybody stand out of the crowd significantly by going with a different genre, so it might be easy to earn the judge's award this week with, say, a description of colonists settling an alien planet in your scifi setting. Perhaps a hell-world like Venus where sulfuric acid rains from the sky and the temperature on the surface is hot enough to keep lead molten, or a floating colony built in the swirling storms high up in a gas giant's atmosphere. Just sayin'! Be creative!

Although this week's challenge is getting a late start (sorry, again!) to keep us on schedule the deadline will still be Wednesday, August 15th.

## Next Week

Next week's challenge will be ""Megastructures"". The Pyramids of Giza, the Great Wall of China, and the Colossus of Rhodes are all examples of truly impressive labor and ingenuity in our own real-world past. In modern day, the Three Gorges Dam is a mindblowing undertaking, and some day in the future we might get to orbit cheaply by riding a space elevator. These might all be called megastructures, requiring years of labor from hundreds or thousands of workmen and the design ingenuity of geniuses.

So what megastructures are in your world? Are they completed and in use? Abandoned and in ruin? Or maybe half-completed when the culture building it was destroyed, or just ran out of money or got bored? Tell us all about it!

## Standard Rules

* All genres welcome.

The thirteen grand mages of the island each killed themselves.

Now this world has two moons. On land, the moons appeared to be close together. From early morning to waking hour on the Day of Black Fire, the second had moved far east, eventually covering the sun. Then it appeared to grow. Stormy seas rose and covered a huge amount of land as the moon grew closer to the planet.

Then the meteors crashed. This caused the most damage to the Region of Water. The meteors were so huge, they crashed into the ground finding small pockets of lava which rose to the surface. The water covered and the beautiful Region of Water became the Obsidian Islands.

That day, water had caught up with the Region of Air. While it took no damage, it float along the seas and the population was too small and weak to rise it again. The Region of Earth was completely cracked. It came alarmingly close to splitting in half.

The remaining population of the Region of Meteorite drowned. Intentionally - something horrible had happened that day. The entire island committed worldwide suicide to prevent it from becoming worse.

1336484444.0,26,self.worldbuilding,tcwh1,Legitimizing airships as a form of travel: world building help request.,935Penn,30,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/tcwh1/legitimizing_airships_as_a_form_of_travel_world/,"I’ll do the short request first, then overdue the information second. SHORT: I’ve been working on a world with airships and I need help legitimizing the use of airships as a prime means of travel.

LONG: Okay, I’ve been working on this for a story and campaign for a while and I’m hoping to get some help with why airships are a focus and the micro and macro economic troubles of the world. The setting is an alternative (not earth) early 1900’s Steam Punk with airships. The problems of the world parallel some current modern problems, and I’m a big fan of cause and effect.

In the past 20-some years, the discovery of a rare mineral element (Haven’t thought of a name yet) led to the great expansion of travel and national boarders. When this element had a strong positive electrical current run through it, its hold on gravity would reverse in physics defying properties, to the point that it could be used to lift very large objects (IE: airships, small islands, etc). I haven’t thought this through too much so that part may need some refining (more on that later).

The problem is that early excitement and economic success from increasing travel distance, cutting travel time, and allowing the expansion into more hostile living conditions; led to an over mining of this element and as such, it is becoming apparent to the informed that the current way of life is not sustainable and the countries and powers that don’t have abundant natural deposits of this element will find themselves at the mercy of those that do…

Basically airships are the cars of today, and the element is oil. I’ve got an idea for the three main power nations, but I’m still struggling a little to legitimize the airship as a necessity. I’m thinking the world would have to have a lot of mountains, canyons, rivers, oceans, etc, that would make an airship more feasible then say trains and basic autos. I’m also thinking airships would be the metal war engines that early 1900 dreadnaughts were, something like a status of power, intimidating. I haven't drawn a map up yet, so the issue of neighbors and races for power is still undecided.

The three nations (unnamed) would basically be an Empire, a Kingdom and a merchant republic. The empire is ruled by a hereditary dictator and has a history of militaristic action that led to the unification of its continent. The Empire's military is mandatory service for a few years of the men, and volunteer for the women, promotion and rank is aptitude based, military tech is uniform and regimented. Strong national pride, weak natural resources.

The Kingdom is set up sort of like medieval Europe. There is a royal family, and then a large class of nobles that owe fealty to the king. They are not a nation per say, but many dukedom’s, duchy’s, etc that owe allegiance and give a portion of taxes but can have their own laws and customs that slightly differ from place to place. The military is not uniform like the empire. Each duke, count, lord, whatever would have a family airship(s) and military force as needed to protect their realm. They’d be an all male military and look down on the Empire for having females. The fighter pilots would be knights, and the airships a Lord's heirloom and family symbol of power. The kingdom benefits from stronger natural resources, but weaker national pride (in-fighting) and a generally divided and selfish group of nobles.

The merchant republic is the last big power and it’s a free collection of cities with democratically elected leaders. There is no ‘military’ per say, but rather many wealthy merchants with a vested interest in protecting their trade. Basically the home of all mercenaries and trade deals that work together and travel where ever there is money to be made. The Merchant republic has some resources, but mostly benefits from its trade deals and success in airship design and maintenance. They were early adopters of the tech and are the only ones who have a mason like class that guards the secret to using the element to make smaller floating islands/cities.

----

So that’s the world in a brief. The campaign for the players would be having a small airship crew that gets caught up in the bigger rumblings of a war for resources. Haven’t decided what nation they’d be from yet, or if they’d be from a minor nation that’s in everyone else’s crosshairs for its resources. It would be fun to work out some of the more micro and macro economic troubles that led up to the current state of the world, but legitimizing the airships would be a good start.

Looking through old posts, it seems that the vast majority of worlds being discussed here are purely fantasy/sci fi in nature. Even ones that take place in “our universe” are generally pretty far removed from modern Earth, such as post-apocalyptic or far-future scenarios. I’m wondering if anyone else is working on projects that are fictional locations in the real world, perhaps with an alternate timeline.

For example, my own project started as me wanting to design a fictional American city and explore all the different neighborhoods, local politics, culture, etc. I then made it the capital of an invented state, and finally developed an alternate modern history for the USA around it. This allows me to focus on the aspects of worldbuilding that interest me (such as politics, war, history, and important people) and mostly ignore the ones that don’t (like excessive map making, languages, and races).

I’ve had a lot of fun thinking about realistic scenarios for how my history would play out, and how they affect my invented state in the present day. Integrating it into the real United States also makes the stories I write that take place in it more relatable for me, and helps me get more immersed in the world. On the other hand, this obviously limits what I can do quite a bit, and keeping things realistic (which is important to me) is a challenge.

So, what do you guys think? Is there a reason most of the worlds on here are fantasy/sci fi?

If Shit Hits the Fan in some variety or another and creates a postapocalyptic world, there will be people whose sole mission in life becomes the preservation and protection of knowledge. The Paladins of Steel from Fallout should spring immediately to mind. 

But walking around in nuclear-powered armor and ransacking the Pentagon isn't really the best way to preserve knowledge: it's just a decent way to archive it. After all, the way we preserve and spread information is by teaching it, and writing it down. The special trials of a postapocalyptic society means that hard drives, tape decks, and books are hard to come by, but there's one ancient method that is remarkably robust, if perpetuated culturally. 

Tattoos. At some point after The End, a tattoo artist and a geometry professor got stuck in the same bunker and got to talking. Not long after that, the first Silver Paladins were born. Tattooed on their collective skins is as much information as the Order can find - medicinal properties of plants, physical and mathematical proofs, number theory, biomedical data, history, engineering, and chemistry. Some tattoos only exist to translate others - notes for the notes. The point isn't that the Paladin can read them, but that *others* can - which means even their backs, shoulders, and head are free game. After all, the Paladin only earns the right to a tattoo when they've mastered the information it shares. 

Paladins explore and teach wherever they go. They try to find old caches of information, and record distant scraps of memory fading fast in the memories of old people. Historians with lists and reams of names and dates and flags inking into their flesh act as record-keepers and storytellers around hundreds of campfires, telling tales from before the Fall and the stories of those who lived through it. Doctors, their hands and arms clad with diagrams and images of plant and animal biology, bring surgery and pharmacology to the sick. Chemists and mathematicians strive to resurrect lost technology to purify water, generate power, or fertilize fields. 

In life, they serve and teach. In death, they are reference guides for new Paladins, and their mummified remains are teaching aids. Their monasteries guard knowledge and protect acolytes. The geometric sweeps and curves across their bodies preserve the lost knowledge of The Before for all time to come.

Update is also pretty easy, since all it involves is altering a thing. If you want to change lead into gold, you'd use updating magic.

Retrieve is giving me lots of trouble though. In computer programming, the retrieve methods usually go something like ""What is *x*?"" with a response like ""This is *x*."" But I don't know what that means in terms of magic.

**You're Zarian if:**


- before meeting up with someone, you decide which greeting word would be most appropriate
- you shake hands with everyone, for everything. The tighter the grip, the more successful you are.
- while shaking hands, you maintain a straight face, then smile after.
- you feel embarrassed when others compliment you, but don't mind at all when others criticize you
- your home is the safest place in the universe. It's the only place you feel truly comfortable.
- you have no problem badmouthing the government, or other groups of authority amongst friends
- you enjoy walking around the town whilst talking with friends
- you're meticulous to make sure your writing is neat, no characters touch each other, and you're writing in a straight line. 
- you use pencil, and criticize people for using ink
- you travel for long periods of time by yourself at a very young age. Having parents accompany you is a sign of weakness.
- whenever you learn a new culture, you always try and act like that.
- you're meticulous to stay well dressed. If there's a crease in your shirt, iron the crap out of that thing, that's humiliating!
- you enjoy watching sports, but yelling, cheering, or making excessive noise or movement is extremely rude.
- you keep the vast majority of your house clean, except your office, which is an utter mess.
- you twiddle with pencils while thinking
- you start criticizing people of authority by the age of 6, start getting obsessed with money by 8, graduate university by 15, but don't get a girl/boyfriend until early twenties. Sure, you can have a fling, but over-intimacy is shameful.
-  you find bartering to be a game, as opposed to a way to save a few bucks
- shopping is a chore, not a hobby. Buy your goods, and get to the next store asap. Unless you're touristing in another city. In which case, you can spend an entire day in a shopping centre.
- you greet and talk with foreigners in their language. Using Zarian to talk to a visitor is rude.
- you can greet, and maintain a simply conversation in every language in the world. Except south-Dasetian. That language is stupid.
- it's not uncommon to politely ask your boss to leave, and finish your work in the comfort of your home.
- There are thousands of different board games out there. If you're invited to dinner, you better bring one that your hosts have never heard of, and teach it to them, enjoyably playing it till the early hours of the morning.
- you have no problem throwing week old food out. Food is insanely cheap.
- you'll only eat fruit if it's nice and cold
- meat if it's steaming hot
- grains at room temperature
- you can't imagine drinking juice without the pulp.
- you treat the sidewalk in front of your house as if it were yours, sweeping it, and yelling at anyone who dares litter.
- it's a posh skill to know all the rules to every card and board game out there, but seriously; there's thousands. You'd be lucky to learn more than a couple of hundred in your life.
- you can recite the name of every Zarisian monarch, and what years they ruled.
- getting up in the morning is the hardest part of your day, but the earlier you do it, the more self respect you have.

1354141618.0,26,self.worldbuilding,13yinj,Let's discuss magic systems!,ephrin,26,0,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/13yinj/lets_discuss_magic_systems/,"Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/10l1s1/feedback_wanted_for_my_magic_system/) post, I propose another thread of the same sort, sharing magic systems for fantasy worlds.

Magic in my world comes from another plane that frequently intersects with the physical world. These intersection points ""leak"" magical energy into the world and these energies, in turn, begin to change the physical world around them. All physical matter is affected by magic ranging from mutating living beings into new forms all the way up to and including granting life to inanimate objects. Leaks are more prominent in areas of the earth that experience significant physical events like volcanoes, earthquakes, or the auroras.

The magical plane is divided into different realms, each of which is ruled by a different magical being or god. The intersection points have a specific ""vector"" which points to one of the realms and the god within it. Each of these gods has a will and personality of their own and that temperament decides what the effects of each magical leak will be. One pointed to the realm of Golgolath, the god of suffering and pestilence, will spread magical disease and mutate local fauna into horrible monsters. One pointed towards Ashi, the goddess of natural beauty, might create pools of regeneration at a spring.

The first magic users were the priests and priestesses of the world, who studied these intersection points and interacted with the gods on the other side. Their repetitive prayers and sacrifices curried favors with the gods on the other side, who granted them magical abilities in exchange. Eventually they learned how to change the vectors of each intersection point so that each one found could be dedicated to their own god of choice, rather than the random vectors and gods with which the points are created. These holy and unholy orders exist to this day, constantly searching for new holy and unholy places to build their monasteries and temples around. They frequently do battle with each other over key intersection points.

The second magical tradition to arise was ""practical magic."" These wizards and witches learned to use the magical flora and fauna, as well as the background magical energies that had seeped into the earth and atmosphere of the world, to create magical potions and charms. These were not nearly as powerful as the spells of the priests and priestesses of the holy orders, but they were nevertheless helpful to the villages and communities near which they lived. While the prominence of these ""hedge wizards"" was to be reduced greatly after the Mages Guild was created, there are still many countless who operate within the realm, continuing to use spells and traditions passed down orally for thousands of years.

The prominence of the mages and the creation of their guild came from those hedge wizards who chose to dedicate their intellectual powers to the study of the magic which they practiced. Rules were discovered, as well as a method by which to write magic to scrolls and spellbooks. Now for the first time spells could be shared and improved across long distances between many mages using the same set of rules. A guild was established in the south, in a new city named Guildport. Those who had a talent for magic traveled from across the lands to join the guild and study the forces of magic in the realm. These mages now are the most powerful magical practitioners in the land, dedicating their lives to creating new and more efficient spells for members of the guild to use.

The system of magical writing is, in and of itself, magical. When a lower-level magical user reads a magical scroll, she sees only the components of the spell that she can understand. A higher level mage, by contrast, would see all the component parts. He could then deconstruct the spell and build new spells with similar components. I see magical writing as almost a kind of programming language; those who are more experienced can take apart and understand the machine language of the individual APIs, while basic users can only use the higher level APIs and objects.

While the mages have one written form of language, the spoken form is different for each user (similar to how there are multiple spoken languages in China that share the same writing system). This makes it difficult for each magic user to determine the spell that their opponent might be casting.

Each spell takes energy to cast, which recharges slowly over time and more quickly near leak points. Magical objects and charms exist, but take significant time and materials to construct and therefore are rather expensive. Too much time near a leak point can cause humans to mutate into several different forms depending on the vector of the leak. Orcs and elves are both examples of the mutations that can take place. Elves require many successive generations of humans near the same leak point, while Orcs can develop within a matter of months. Orcs in turn can continue to mutate into Ogres or worse. 

So, what do you guys and gals think? I think this system has an internal consistency as well as opportunity to be creative with new ideas and spells. A quick note, I'm well aware that much of this is pretty standard trope for fantasy. While I'm not trying to make a carbon copy of Tolkien, I'm also not trying to create anything brand new. That's ok with me, so please refrain from sharing how boring you think elves and dwarves are for storytelling purposes. My concerns are more with taking a traditional fantasy story and giving it internal and logical consistency rather than reinventing the wheel. High fantasy can be really fun, but you have to work to make sure things don't get out of hand.

I have been doodling and drawing maps ever since I can remember.  My school work from an early age was littered with little islands of all shapes and sizes.  When we started to write short stories in grade school, all of my stories had maps and lived as a part of a larger world.  I guess it isn't a surprise that I opted to major in Geography and minor in History at University.  My focus was on cultural geography, but every aspect of the program I loved.  From cultural, physical, urban, economic, natural resource management etc...  My career is based around the broad term of a 'social science' degree, and I work with at risk youth ages 12-18.  I use some techniques from my degree but without the 'geographic spin', and instead using the history of the youth as the theme.  This lack of actual 'geography' in my life has left a void, and I started map making again over the last couple of years.

I randomly created the world or ""Spritos"".  When I created it I didn't have an end goal.  I like to think that some day I'll write some short stories, or even a novel from the world.  Maybe someone else would even like to write something based on it.  The real reason I do it is because I just like to create a place and keep building the history and culture of a place once I establish the geographic features.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/ErIIO.jpg) is the basic topography and vegetation.  A 'satellite' image of the world with names of ocean features

What reason(s) could there be for all of these cultures to swear off using guns and honorably agree to only use primitive weapons in battle?

1361226855.0,24,self.worldbuilding,18s1ek,The Eidolons,Reedstilt,27,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/18s1ek/the_eidolons/,"As I mentioned a few days ago, [I'm laying the foundations of a new setting](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/18iaah/toying_with_a_new_setting_but_the_geography_is/). Here I'm going to talk about a handful of the more common Eidolons. If you follow the link, you can read a bit more about what an Eidolon is, but for the moment you can just assume their a metaphoric entity that represents a school of magic. A class of magically empowered humans known (at least for now) as Archons channel the Eidolonic power (often more than one). The Archons make up most of the elites in various countries of the world, sometimes as rulers, sometimes as merchants, sometimes as scientists, or in whatever other role their Eidolonic powers allow them to dominate.

**The Eternal Architect:** Though no longer used as a primary Eidolon for the ruling classes, the Eternal Architect remains a common complimentary Eidolon for many Archons. The Eternal Architect represents mankind's ability to command and reshape his environment, both natural and social, into forms more pleasing to him. The Eternal Architect is a visionary, laboring to achieve some grand design. The Archons who employ this magic are inventors, artisans, and leaders. Their tools, art, and laws are all imbued with magical potency. As with all Eidolonic magic, the Eternal Architect alters the Archon's mind and body. The Archon becomes increasingly dissatisfied with their prior efforts and obsessed with perfecting their work. Physically, their bodies are reshaped to resemble their chosen medium.

**The Whispering Spider:** A long-favored Eidolon of the elites of the Anthalmisa Republic and conspiratorial Archons everywhere, the Whispering Spider is the master of secrets, plots, and subtle manipulation. Archons who employ this magic are stealthy and secretive. They pull the strings that bind society like a puppeteer, conjuring these strings into physical existence for a variety of purposes. These Archons have a tendency to grow increasingly paranoid and reclusive. The physical transformation is dramatic, with the Archon gaining additional eyes and limbs, which do not always resemble their human equivalents. Fortunately, the magic of the Whispering Spider includes the means to obscure their identities and form.

**The Treasure Kraken:** Since the recent coup in the Anthalmisa Republic, the Treasure Kraken as been the primary Eidolon of the Anthalmisan rulers. Throughout history, it has been the the preferred Eidolon of merchants and treasurers. It is Eidolon of wealth and economic exchange. This magic gives the Archon power over currencies, imbue exchanges with magical consequences, and to manage sprawling monopolies. Archons who adhere to the Treasure Kraken become increasingly avaricious and miserly and their bodies eventually transform into a formless mass of tentacles and jealous eyes.

**The Untamed Wilderness:** The Archons of the Warrulur Confederacy, the Anthalmisa Republic's neighbor and major rival, and various 'primitive' societies throughout history favor the Untamed Wilderness, Eidolon of mankind's place in and mastery over nature. It is both the Noble Savage and the environmentalist. Those who practice this magic can command beasts, survive effortlessly in the all manner of wild places, and create items from stone and wood that can rival any modern equivalent. The physical and mental transformations of those who dedicate themselves to the Untamed Wilderness is similar--becoming increasingly like the beasts with whom the Archon shares his world.

**The Serpentine River:** The second most popular Eidolon among the Archons of the Warrulur Confederacy is the Serpentine River. It is the Eidolon of renewal, sacrifice, potions and poisons, which has made it a popular Eidolon among the doctors the world over. This magic is used not only to heal but also to inflict poisons and diseases onto other, which the Archon must personally experienced and survived before passing it on someone else--though the magic of the Serpentine River does greatly increase his odds of surviving such ailments. The mental transformation associated with the Serpentine River is slow and subtle, results of a constant sacrifice of memories as the price of healing. The physical transformation gives the Archon reptilian features with shimmering blue and brown scales.

**The Headless Hive:** When the Desanylan Empire fell to the Winter Revolution, a chain of events began that promoted the rise of the Headless Hive as prominent Eidolon among Archons in many nations. It is the Eidolon of egalitarianism, anarchy, and uniformity. This magic excels in guiding societies without necessarily ruling societies, unify the people, and sowing dissent against established hierarchies. The mental transformations of the Headless Hive results in sublimation of the Archon's self-identity into the identity of the community which he serves. The physical transformation dissolves the Archons body into a swarm of insects.

* technology beyond the level of either dark ages or medieval ages would be impossible.
* this would include electricity and gunpowder based technologies being rendered impossible, among other things.
* humans, flora and fauna still have to be able to exist in the world, meaning the scientific principles and laws of nature behind cells still have to hold.
* dark age / medieval age and lower technologies must still be fully do-able.
* more advanced technologies may not necessarily have to be impossible, but in that case, at least unreliable enough that almost no one would use it.
* this can't simply be a psychological (""it's unthinkable""), social (""it's shunned"") or governmental (""it's banned"") construct.

Any thoughts and/or questions would be greatly appreciated, as I have never come up with anything like this before. So without further adieu, here is my idea, copied from there. 

I am a bit late, but hey, why not. I am assuming a complete breakdown on the federal level. [Here is a map I came up with.](http://i.imgur.com/WaCe7.gif)

Alaska spends several years struggling. After managing to get some exports of oil going again and finding buyers, it realizes that Russia is becoming increasingly predatory. After appealing to Canada, it becomes a province of Canada, protecting it for the time being from Russian interests.

Hawaii becomes a new shipping center. After the UN headquarters are destroyed, and much debate and deal making, the UN relocates to Hawaii, mainly due to Chinese influence which is stronger now that the US no longer exists.

California splits off, and after a bloody civil war between the norther and southern halves, unifies after several years.

Oregon and Washington form an alliance. The new Cascadian Republic maintains strong ties with California, Hawaii, and Canada.

Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, and Utah all band together. Their natural resources and strangle hold on travel from east to west grant them security from attackers, lest they block travel to or from the west coast. This becomes known as the Mountain Republic. The western portion of Nebraska joins this alliance, as central Nebraska has been over run by immigrants from the Dakota wars.

The Dakotas begin talks to join. After many failed talks, South Dakota invades, hungry for the rich oil lands of the north. A war rages back and fourth until both are reduced to desolate wastelands.

Arizona turns into a hell hole. The state government fails to unify the people. Pockets of militias and city states pop up. Fighting is constant. Travel through the region becomes impossible for decades due to extreme danger from armed gangs.

Texas and Oklahoma join forces. Half of New Mexico is annexed into this alliance forcibly. A border is set up running through the center of what used to be New Mexico, as the western half sees spill over violence from the remains of the failed Arizonan state. Tex-oma also annexes Kansas to secure vital shipping routes in and out of the Mountain Republic's Colorado Province. Tex-oma also invades Louisiana and Arkansas in an attempt to secure access to the Mississippi River. A healthy insurgency breaks out in Louisiana, spreading into east Texas and up into Arkansas. These areas become police states, heavily occupied and prone to violence. Despite that, Tex-oma manages to maintain control.

East of the Mississippi River, a power bloc forms. Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky all join together to form the Southern Confederated States. The panhandle of Florida also joins this union after a violent break with the peninsula. Aggression exists between the Confederacy and the Tex-oma Republic over river traffic on the Mississippi River. The Confederacy secretly funds and arms rebel groups in the occupied territories of Arkansas and Louisiana. After much fighting, Florida splits, with the more hispanic and cuban peninsula retaining independence from the Confederacy.

Maine says ""Fuck all you guys"" and joins Canada, ultimately inspiring Alaska to do the same eventually.

New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Mass., and Rhode Island throw in together and form the Atlantic Republic of New England. Despite some initial squabbles over New Jersey, they eventually settle on these borders.

Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, and West Virginia form the Appalachian Union. They control a large portion of the traffic from the Great Lake States to the ocean, and from the Atlantic Republic to the Confederacy. There is a large and violent insurgency in West Virginia, suspected to be funded by elements in the Confederacy, eager to lay hands on the rich coal deposits of the area.

MIssouri remains independent, and like so many former soviet republics, eventually becomes poor and corrupt. After many years, it is accepted into the Tex-oma republic, furthering the conflict over Mississippi river traffic.

Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio all join forces. This becomes known as The Great Lake States.

The newly created Republica de Florida thrives. It maintains close ties with the Tex-oma government, as they avoid sending shipping traffic through Confederate waters by routing to this new Republic. It also maintains healthy ties to the Appalachian Union and the Atlantic Republic due to previous trends of migration from these areas to southern Florida. It is suspected that money and weapons are flowing into this region from the Tex-oma Republic to fend off aggression and troop buildups along the norther border with the Confederacy.

Early fighting between the Atlantic Republic and the Appalachian Union sees the complete destruction of D.C. and massive damage and bombardment in New York. Fresno, California is all but wiped off the map during the civil war. No major cities exist in the Dakota's. Although neighboring countries have begun to make advances into the region.

I'm sure more intricate things would come into play, and borders would shift a bit in some directions, but these are the broad strokes.

Lothexills mate pretty much by French-kissing, so sticking your tongue out would be like flipping them the bird. Their womb is located on their backs. They give birth to fertilized egg sacs, each containing exactly 15 eggs, via the cloaca on the front of their abdomen. Egg sacs can be transferred between Lothexills through the cloacas, I forget why. Non-pregnant Lothexills can use their womb as a storage device, usually for food.

Tons of lore inside!",deiphiz,26,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/11a7qd/im_new_to_worldbuilding_but_heres_my_wip_world/,"I've had this world idea since high school, but I never got to actually bringing it to life. It actually started as a story I never finished about an assassin who was to kill a king in a desert kingdom. The name of the kingdom was Eridia (Which I renamed to Auredia after playing Borderlands). I also made a love story that took place in the same universe, then started my idea of creating a shared universe for any story I would make in the future.

I wanted to make a fantasy world where magic can be scientifically explainable, some sort of line between fantasy and Sci-fi. I also wanted a world that evolves to a point where the people even start venturing into space. Therefore, I can make almost any genre of video game/book/movie fit just by choosing an appropriate point in the world's timeline.

The name of continent is Aeronne for now. I plan to change it later because it kind of gets annoying how much the name shows up in my lore. And there is *a lot* of lore so far. And I'm not even finished detailing it yet!

As its WIP, I would like some help with this if anyone is willing since the scope of worldbuilding is so overwhelming for me. At least a few comments and criticisms would help too.

**The Era of Deterrence has ended.**

**The Great Pall is upon us.**

The decades of politicking and debate, meant to save   
the fair and fractured lands of Geredohl and Rjehre from the
cancerous wars that have plagued them since time immemorial 
with delicate webs of penmanship, has been for naught. Though 
the opening blows have barely begun to unfurl, the cries of vultures 
can be heard throughout the courts and palaces.


And for the majority that cannot yet hear the clash of metal 
or see the smoke above the tree line, a sense of unnerving stillness 
permeates even the thickest tavern walls. The signs cannot be 
ignored as taxes are raised and tithes on farmers demand an 
unsustainable amount of produce to be given up. Children spend 
their breaks starring up in wonderment as a man covered in medals 
and scars expounds on them the honor of death.  Distrust and 
paranoia spread like wildfire, shadowy figures take away heads of 
family, politicians are sacked and labeled as malcontent, or worse
 – traitor. Banks shutter and close as families drain their entire savings 
and shops board up their windows as only the bare necessities are 
bought to save for what will surely be hard times to come.


A peasant from one of the numerous hamlets north of Yeappet, 
old of age and poor in sight swears to his equally hunched pub-mates 
after a long day of work that he saw huge fleets of steel belching oily 
smoke congregating on the horizon to the raucous jibbing of his peers.
	

A meeting is adjourned early beneath an ancient hall in Wis’emov as the 
attending devolve into shouting over matters of offended pride and call 
to arms, the attending staff guarding the doors stealing worried glances 
at each other. An ignored grizzled elder with a missing eye sits in a
corner seat , provided only out of token consideration for being the 
only of his kind to remember the last time war touched the continents, 
slowly closes his remaining eye and cries. 


South of Staffenweld a mother, speaking in hushed soothing tones
 hurriedly guides her questioning children into their room as a man in 
a tall hat and a long coat, seared into silhouette by the rising sun, 
asks her husband to step outside for a moment, the bulge of a 
holstered pistol barely visible against his greatcoat.


A Lord-Commander waves to a crowd during a military parade 
in Cobourne, confetti and flowers falling to the floorboards of his 
ornate carriage. He fakes a smile to the roaring approval of the 
crowd, his teeth matching the luminosity of his perfectly embroidered 
gloves. Yet a close enough passerby taking notice might have seen 
through the raining streamers and the glint of polished metal to 
notice the dead look in his eyes from reading the morning’s intelligence; 
neighbors calling to arms, alliances breaking and forming, opportunities 
coming to pass. It is the same for every state.


A young man, barely of shaving age grips his slip of paper tightly 
as he is jostled along with a score of others in the back of one cattle 
car among tens of thousands bound for the Volven staging grounds. 
 Little does he know that he will be dead in a mere 68 days along with 
the rest of his squad as they nestle in an abandoned Inn, the banter 
from their burgeoning new comradery keeping their last moments 
blissfully unaware of the mortar shell hurtling towards them through 
the fog from across the Durliffen River at the onset of the Qurek counter-attack. 


Indeed, how can anyone know of the things yet to come? The diplomats 
of the day have come to calling this interim the Great Pall. For it is like 
before the onfall of a coming storm. With rolling bruised clouds of purple 
and black covering the sky from horizon to horizon, all of life standing 
still in tantric anticipation. Whether or not the coming blows could be 
parried, they have subconsciously been accepted as the only path 
forward. The play has been set in motion, now only the acts are left undeveloped. 


Already the names of nations capitulated and annexed to greater 
powers reads like the roll-call to the apocalypse. Fair Carravon, 
dissolved between Ochremark and Prahazia, Morvania ceding a quartet 
of land as the bodies of her slain defenders still cool. The potential of 
Qurek dissolved as it is split in twain, although for how long is anyone’s 
guess but the War Council in Vokka. Caperta, Artos, the Great Voquet 
Railway, it would seem to a world waiting with baited breath that these 
casualties might ease the untenable pressure, but they are merely 
distractions. The real killing blow has yet to be unveiled, and while it
 s doubtless each nation believes theirs to be the final act, only one 
will truly act as the decider. It may not be the most obvious; an even 
scale only needs a feather to tip in a single direction.


The call to arms scream out in a never ending peal in every town, 
young men collected and shipped away in appalling quantities, forests 
of gun stocks, rolling plains of tank tracks, pyramids of helmets 
produced through industries that never sleep. Rivers that do not 
become runoff for deadly pollutants are sucked dry by the endless 
hunger of production quotas. A lake that may have supplied a small 
villa with its water and food for a thousand years is drained so that 
a tenth of a percent can be added to the months dossier report. 


Like an avalanche, the momentum is irreversible: the world is going 
to war. Like a prey trapped between two predators, the un-contendable 
small declare their desperate allegiance, hoping that their decision will 
inflict the least pain, and for either the mad or the stupid, bring them 
the greatest reward. 


From the steppes of the Ubiqte to the Stavlands tundra, Tenneram waits. 
Will it be able to survive to coming blows? What will become of the great 
lands of Geredohl and Rjehre and their inhabitants? No one can foresee 
the melting of the ancient metal statues of the Royal Palace in Nova-Edwold
 that had stood for a hundred years to make more artillery shells. Or the 
farmers of Duwburg, their land stripped and their sons taken, jumping off 
the tall cliffs of Kelladon to meet their death or even the famous Last 
Opera performed in Toriek while the city burns to cinders.



Tenneram can only wait for the Great Pall to lift, and the Grand War to begin.

Klingons are warriors, Elves are noble and knowledgeable, and dwarfs like to mine. We see little in the way of individuality. I'm sorry, but I have a hard time believing this. This is not realistic. You cannot tell me that in an entire planet, or even in just a race of people, there are so few variations.

Take humanity itself as an example, sure our races have basic stereotypes, but after that, no two people are the same in likes, skills, opinions, etc. They may have regional customs, but that is as far as it goes.

Also, once people have the means to travel, travel they will. They will ""mix"" with other races, and a city will not remain a city of a single race for very long.

In D&amp;D my usual issue isn't characters but towns &amp; cites, so I was wondering if someone has ideas for what are the core ingredients of the usual town and city?

## Last Week

A lot of submissions from people who weren't previous winners last week, awesome!

Popular vote went to /u/Alexandewales and his submission of [""The Wizardless Wars"", a series of three conflicts fought without the aid of wizards on one side or the other](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1b6bm0/weekly_challenge_warfare/c9412lr). The judges' award goes to /u/Hoyarugby who gave us [a scant glimpse of a singe battle in a war between mighty airships](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1b6bm0/weekly_challenge_warfare/c945ta0).

## This Week

What is a dwarf? A short, sturdy creature fond of drink and industry. Well, let's examine them more in-depth in this week's challenge, ""Remix: Dwarves"".

There are a number of common aspects we ascribe to dwarves: short and stocky, beardy, alcoholic, stalwart fighters, industrious, greedy, often armed with axes or hammers.

A few days ago, /u/Valafaar posted a link to [an old M:tG discussion of dwarf design](http://www.reddit.com/tb/1aymqv), talking about likely adaptations a race of dwarves might have if they lived in tight tunnels underground for generations. In Dwarf Fortress, dwarves can become ""cave adapted"", that is, they become so used to the dark confines of their underground fortresses that the next time they emerge into the open again they can become ""sun sick"".

But what if your dwarves didn't live in subterranean tunnels? What about desert dwarves or sea dwarves or forest dwarves? Or what if they did live in tunnels, but in this case the tunnels are in the honeycombed asteroids that are home to space dwarves? If your dwarves are industrious and greedy for gems and precious metals, *why*?

The deadline for this challenge will be **Wednesday, April 10th**.

## Next Week

I'm looking into my crystal ball... I see... I see... I see that next week's challenge will be ""Prophecy &amp; Prognostication"". Who in your world foretells the future, is it diviners and fortune tellers or a team of scientists with a quantum temporal window? Are these things destined to be true, pure bunk, or somewhere in between? Are these prophecies widely known and believed by all the people, or are the kept secret so the knowledge can be used by a clandestine cabal?

## Standard Rules

* All genres welcome.

* Deadline is 7-ish days from now.

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

We are offering fellow redditors to colloborate on a RPG game to be published on Android first and later on other platforms. We have built the software side and published a beta to test it. So we want to build a collaborative world with you guys and a story on which we can build the game, complete with enemy behaviours that you want etc.
The game will be free, however we may accept advertisements and we are thinking of 3 options to deal with the money:

1- Give all of the profit to the contributers
2- Give all of it to charity
3- No ads, no need to deal with money.

We can spare only a little time and budget to the project, so what we can do will be resitricted with it. We can use our framework to the max, but any extra artwork/polish will be limited (unless some contributers can work on artwork).

This won't be a neverending venture. We have the framework and can adapt it to the story in the matter of days. So we will see the resulting game quite fast.

By the way, we cannot apply a custom map, as it will be far too time consuming, we have automated ways of creating maps and we will stick to them.

Thats all I can think about now. Waiting for your responses :)

More on the game:
In the year 2075, humanity is on the brink of world war. Over the 62 years of progress from our present, science has taken leaps and bounds. We've prolonged our lives to 200+ years, fusion energy is common, and Mechs are now commonplace on the battlefield and off. In a preventitive act, one country launches a WMD on another. This triggers mass nuclear war, and the near-destruction of the human race. As nuclear winter sets in, survivors eke an existence in this new frozen world. 
700-ish years later, humanity is on the rise again, and the nuclear winter set into an ice age. The top and bottom fifths of the world are covered by advancing ice shelves, and everywhere else but the equator is permanent winter. In this new age, technology is a rarity for only a few disparate civilizations, whereas superstition rules over the rest. As humanity once again fears monsters in the dark, magic seeps back into our lives from the distant remnants of our past. With it, comes all manner of mythological beast and race. This is fellwinter, a land where the dominant color is white, and magic-wielding barbarians duke it out with towering mechs, as well as trolls, dragons, orcs, griffins, and all manner of monsters.

1374872743.0,22,self.worldbuilding,1j4ecd,A world where humans and AI androids are competing species.,unfortunately_bored,29,7,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1j4ecd/a_world_where_humans_and_ai_androids_are/,"EDIT: I changed ~~some~~ a lot of things based on advice I've gathered. 

About fifty years after humans created AI androids humans were all but exterminated by war. The AIs reprogramed themselves to be no longer depended on humans and went about creating a society with the main goal of scientific discovery. Shortly after this humans started rebuilding as well, but it'd been several generations after the war so they'd forgotten how to do much of anything (medicine, reading, ect) and were dependent on the androids. The androids, ~~out of fear of re-enslavement, refused to teach the humans and also started releasing chemicals in the air to ""prevent harm from solar flares"" (In reality it caused fertility of the humans to fall by twenty or so precent)~~ view the humans as lesser beings and keep them restricted to the wastelands or the slums. 

Basically every android city (which is huge, ~~over crowded~~ and dark seeing as the androids have no need for light or personal space) is accompanied by a near by human town which relies on the androids for technology and in return ~~supplies grunt labor.~~ scavenge the waste land or mine for scrap metal to be used in construction. AIs delegate this task to them because none of them are willing to do it, and the idea of building brainless drones is taboo. 

A little tangent; the androids main goals are to 1) Discover the truths about the universe 2) Improve self and species. 

This caused a small minority of the androids to 'overclock' themselves in a hell bent attempt to improve their processing power. The effects ~~are addictive and~~ of the obsession eventually causes them to overheat.  


If there's any flaw in this or advice you can give please comment.
