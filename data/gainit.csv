1365019142.0,531,self.gainit,1bly8t,"Strength, Size, and the Truth About Rep Ranges",InMyDreams_Nahh,594,63,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1bly8t/strength_size_and_the_truth_about_rep_ranges/,"I’ve been planning this post for a while. I think the users of /r/gainit will benefit greatly from learning the difference between lifting for strength and lifting for size. I’ve made brief comments in the past about it, and it’s been met with a lukewarm reception. That may be due to the popularity of  the beginner strength programs on reddit, and the revelation that size isn’t necessarily the aim of those program (even though that’s what us “gainers” want, right?). We’ll get to that. First, I’d like to give you a brief introduction into the two main types of hypertrophy. 

*****

### Myofibrillar hypertrophy

*****

Myofibrillar hypertrophy, or “strength” hypertrophy, leads to an increase in the myosin and actin proteins, which are the contractile proteins in the myofibrils (the type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers, or the “fast-twitch” fibers). In simpler terms, when lifting heavy weights and putting your muscles under new stress (**progressive overload** -- increasing either the volume or weight of a lift every workout to ensure increased myofibrillar hypertrophy), your body will respond by strengthening it’s ability to contract its muscles. 

The recruited motor units in the movements also increase with myofibrillar hypertrophy, as does their efficiency, effectively allowing the body to perform movements “easier” over time, hence the need to progressively increase weight.  Ultimately, the effect is an increase in the strength and response of your fast-twitch muscle fibers. The “stronger” your fast-twitch fibers, the “stronger” the neuromuscular response, and the heavier the weight you are able to lift.

*****

### Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy

*****

Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, or “size” hypertrophy, leads to an increase in the amount of sarcoplasm in your muscle tissue. Sacroplasm is the fluid (cytoplasm) that surround the myofibrils in a muscle. The sarcoplasm contains things such as ATP, glycogen, creatine phosphate, and water. In simpler terms, when sarcoplasmic hypertrophy occurs, the amount of fluid (or cytoplasm) in the muscle increases (expands), creating a larger muscle. This type of hypertrophy is achieved by using slower, controlled movements to put the muscles under stress for longer and activate the slow and fast twitch muscle fibers and deplete the muscles of energy. 

Note that increasing the size of a muscle **does not** require an increase in the amount of contractile protein in the myofibrils, meaning increasing size does not mean increasing your strength. In the same vein, strength can be increased without causing an increase in the size of the muscle. 

*****

### How do I train for the different types of hypertrophy? 

*****

The primary way to train for size or strength is to measure the time under tension, and how heavy the weight causing the tension is (relative to your own level of strength – i.e. your 1 rep maximum). This involves either a focus on neuromuscular training (strength) or metabolic training (size)

Neuromuscular training focuses on the nerves and increasing the contractile proteins in the myofibrils. This is specialized by keeping your muscles under very heavy stress (within 85-100% of your 1RM), using fast, explosive movements for 1-40 seconds per set. Rest periods should be anywhere from 90 seconds to 5+ minutes.

Metabolic training focuses on the supply of energy of muscles, and depleting said energy. This is specialized by keeping your muscles under moderately heavy stress (within 60-75% of your 1RM) using slow, controlled movements for 40-70 seconds per set.  Rest periods should be between 30-60 seconds. 

You may have noticed that there is a gap between 75-85% of your 1RM between these levels of training. That is because that is the spot where these two forms of training are generally on an even level (i.e. you will increase strength and size in a somewhat equal manner).

*****

### How should I measure my 1 rep maximum and the related percentages?

*****

Fortunately, we have a lot of great resources available to us to calculate this easily. [This](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/other7.htm) calculator will assist you in finding your different weight lifting maximums at different percentages. I find the easiest way to use this tool is to get in the gym for a day and do 1x5 for every single exercise in your routine. Make sure you are using a weight where you are maxing out on the fifth rep and could not manage another. You can then input each number for each lift at the number of 5 reps and you will get all your weight numbers for the different percentages. You will see how to use these different percentages to help you reach your goals below.

*****

### How should I measure the time my muscles are under tension in accordance with my goals?

*****

The easiest way to do this is to adhere to a specific rep scheme. Naturally, when performing fewer reps, your muscle will be under tension for a shorter period of time and the weight will be closer to your maximum (and therefore building strength through neuromuscular training). On the other side, when completing a higher amount of reps your muscles will be under tension for longer, and the weight will need to a be a little further from your maximum to allow for the higher volume (and therefore building size through metabolic training). Here are the rep guidelines to follow for your specific training goals:

Rep Range|Percent of 1 Rep Max|Achieved Amounts of Hypertrophy|
:---|:---:|---:|
1-5 Reps|85-100%|Mostly myofibrillar, a little sarcoplasmic|
6-8 Reps|75-85%|A near equal moderate amount of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic|
9-12 Reps|70-75%|Largely sarcoplasmic, some myofibrillar, a little endurance|
13-15 Reps|65-70%|Mostly sarcoplasmic, some endurance, and a little myofibrillar|
15+ Reps |65% and below|Largely endurance, some sarcoplasmic, a little myofibrillar*|

*Note that as you more you increase the reps beyond 15, the more endurance takes over and the benefits of either hypertrophy become negligible.

*****

### How do I use this information to create a workout routine to meet my goals?

*****

First, identify what your goal is. Are you looking to put on some size, do you want to see increases in strength, or do you want to work on both at the same time? There is nothing wrong with any of these goals, and each has their own pros/cons:

* Primarily training for strength is a goal that has few cons, especially if you are mostly satisfied with your current size. You can still gain small amounts of size, and you can vastly increase your strength in a short period of time if you train and recover properly. Be wary though. High intensity strength training is *very* taxing on the central nervous system, and overtraining can occur easily. If you want to train for strength, employ set/rep schemes such as 5x5, 6x4, 8x3 with high rest periods in between sets. Lift within 85% of your 1RM at 5 reps, and increase the percentage as you decrease reps.
* Primarily training for size is a goal that has benefits, but does have drawbacks. If you train for size, especially as a beginner, you will eventually hit a wall in the gains you are able to make due to a lack of increased strength, and you will have to focus some on strength training at some point (this is the reason strength programs are recommended for beginners). The lower your level of strength, the sooner you are going to hit a plateau.  If you want to train primarily for size, employ set/rep schemes such as 3x15, 4x12, and 5x9 with a lower rest period in between sets. Supersets (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest in between) also becomes a strong option to deplete even more energy. Lift at least 65% of your 1RM, increasing the percentage as you decrease reps.
* Training for both strength and size is in my opinion the best way to go. You get the benefits of both forms of training at the same time.  There are two methods that I recommend to achieve this:

## Method #1: Traditional Strength/Size Optimization Training

Employ set rep schemes such as 4x8, 5x7, or 6x6 with a moderate rest period of around 60-120 seconds. Lift 75% of your 1 RM for 8 reps, 80% for 7 reps, and ~85% for 6 reps. 

## Method #2: Linear Periodization

Linear periodization allows you to focus your goals on different ranges on the hypertrophy spectrum during different “periods.” Here are two examples of a linear periodization schedule:

Weeks 1-4: 3x15 reps at 65% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 4x10 reps at 72% of your max  
Weeks 9-12: 5x5 reps at 85% of your max  

Weeks 1-4: 4x12 reps at 70% of your max  
Weeks 5-8: 5x7 reps at 80% of your max  
Weeks 9-12 6x3 reps at 90% of your max  

In the end, I think whether you use linear periodization, a different form of periodization, a pyramid rep scheme, etc. that you should eventually utilize all the different rep ranges if you want to your training to be as optimal and effective as possible.

*****

### In conclusion 


*****

I really hope this information has been helpful to you, and gives you perspective on exactly what direction you need to be headed in to achieve your goals. Remember that the workout is only a small part of the equation and that nutrition and recovery are a big part of what will maximize the effectiveness of this information, and I wish the biggest and strongest of gains on every one of you!

Alrighty. In this post I am going to summarize my complete journey from a skinny “Do you even lift?” kid to where I am today. I’ll tell you how I got there and share all I have learned along the way
	.
I first got interested in building some muscle when I was about 17. I worked out with a bench in my basement and got **some** results, but nothing near what I wanted. Throughout this period I was obsessed with having a six-pack, so I was not eating enough. I did not track calories, protein, or anything. I didn’t look so great. Here’s some pics from that time period, spring of my senior year of high school:

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/aPKYM) body weight: about 150 lb

I’m the blonde kid. Yeah, not a lot of good size there. At this time my routine solely consisted of dicking around with dumbbells. Diet was just stupid like I said. Everyone here says you need to eat to gain, clearly I had not yet learned that lesson.

Flash forward a few months and I get to college, I now have access to a full weightroom, but like an asshole I only use the dumbbells and machines because I’m too chickenshit to be bothered with anything else. However I was very dedicated, I hit the gym every day and gave it 100%. Sadly that didn’t matter because my routine sucked and my diet was the same as before, I was obsessed with having abs so I severly limit my intake. No tracking of protein or any other macronutrients. Here’s where this got me after about six months:

[Album]( http://imgur.com/a/GZINe) Body weight was about 150 lb

As you can see I had some abdominal definition, but who cares? I was still a twig and I wanted to be big and ripped. At this point I stopped lifting for about two years, mostly due to class, girlfriend, undergraduate research completely taking over my life. I was no longer limiting my food intake however, and was eating whatever I wanted with a healthy appetite. 

After my time off, I looked like [this](http://imgur.com/oQh9lWI). Bigger yes, but not in the way I wanted, I was flabby and out of shape. I weighed about 185 lb. Not huge for 6'2''.

I decided one day that it was time to change, and I was going to get ripped or die ‘mirin. Here is where things started to go right for me.  I actually did a little research and found that protein is important for building muscle, so that’s what I started eating; meat and lots of it. I’m eating lots of protein, pretty much all the meat I want, and not a lot of carbs. Maybe a half cup of oatmeal a day. I don’t have any progress pics from the start of this period, I wish I did, it would be interesting to see. 

I found r/fitness (the best thing that ever happened to me fitness wise) and took in  and applied the new information. I started doing squats (albeit not to parallel), bench with a barbell, and some deadlifts. Everything else I just used dumbbells for, but I always gave it my all in the weightroom. For every exercise I would do 5 sets of 10 reps, hitting every body part. I split my workout into a shoulder/legs day; bicep/back day; and tricep chest/day. I also did HIIT cardio (sprinting) because I thought it would magically give me abs. After about six months of that I got to here:

[Spring 2008](http://imgur.com/a/8eTvE) Body weight about 190 lb

Well, I was certaintly getting somewhere, but I wanted more. I decided to go full on “squats n’ oats”. I deloaded my squat and started going past parallel. I did not literally do SS or any beginner program. However my primary goal was to maximize my strength on squat, bench, deadlift, ohp, and power clean, which is the essence behind SS and SL. What I did was essentially do two compound barbell movements every workout. For example I’d have a squat/ohp day; deadlift/power clean; and a bench/squat day. My routine might have looked something like this:

Day A: Squat 5 X 5; OHP 5X5; Dumbbell shoulder press 5 X 10; pull ups 5  X AMRAP(As Many Reps As Possible)

Day B: deadlift 5 X 5; power clean 5 X 5; dumbbell bicep curl 5 X 10; chin ups 5 X AMRAP; dumbbell rows 1 X AMRAP

Day C: Squat 5 X 5; barbell bench press 5 X 5; dumbbell bench press 5 X 5; pull ups 5 X AMRAP

Then take a rest day, rinse, repeat.

During this period I was eating, but not enough. I actually counted calories and protein for the first time in my life, and I would hit 2600 kCal with 200 g of protein every single day. At the beginning of this training phase my numbers were: squat 200 X 1; deadlift 315 X 1; OHP 115 X 1; bench 200 X 1. Here’s where that got me to after about six months in terms of physique:

[Fall 2011](http://imgur.com/a/nQBLC#0) body weight about 200 lb

Yep, I got a lot bigger, pretty solid gains. Notice the back got much bigger, also notice I was doing pull ups/chin ups every workout. I think that was a smart move on my part. But I was still just getting started. Here I am a few months later after doing a little bulk and a cut

[Spring 2012](http://imgur.com/a/cYHZc#0) weigh about 190 lb in these pics

I cut a little more after this point, and realized I wanted more size still. So I began what was essentially a year of pure bulking and powerlifting training. Every day I would eat a minimum of 3000 kCal, most days I would eat even more. I didn;’t even track (a mistake looking back), but I would guess 3600 kCal. I Always I hit at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. My training switched over to 5/3/1. As per 5/3/1 instructions, I tested my 1RM on all my lifts, they were: Squat 330; Deadlift 405; Bench 270; and OHP 160. 

So I kept up with 531 and eating like a horse for a long time. I broke up the bench press progression with some cycles of smolov jr. After about 6 months my 1RM’s were: Squat 375lb; Deadlift 450 lb; Bench 300 lb; and OHP 175 lb. Cool. So I kept on trucking with that. I stepped up the intensity of my workouts, increased calories, and a few months later I could squat 375 X 2 X 2; deadlift 500 X 1, 440 X 6, and 405 X 10; OHP 190 X 1; bench didn’t move much. Here’s how I looked after all of that:

[Fall 2012](http://imgur.com/a/SEJza#0) weighed 220 lb at this time

In about a year I had gotten bigger and a shit ton stronger. I also realized I fucking sucked at powerlifting. My numbers were garbage from some one who weighed 220 lb and I was getting sick of low rep sets. So I decided to cut and focus on hypertrophy training. Time to see what muscle I had built under this fat. I scaled back the calories to 2300 kCal/day and started doing PHAT. This has taken me to where I am right now, pictured in the album below

[A few weeks ago](http://imgur.com/a/BJDWj#0) body weight is around 195 to 205 depending on how much water im holding and if I need to take a dumper.

I’m very happy with how I look today. I've surpassed what I've ever though was possible, but I still want more! I’m going to keep on getting bigger and leaner and see what I’m capable of.

**TL;DR** I went from [this](http://imgur.com/fWbNaIf) to [this](http://imgur.com/7n6Szts)

In the comments section I'll highlight what I think are the most important principles of gaining I've learned along the way.

____

This is a guide to help you understand the process of cutting body fat without losing while minimizing any strength or muscle loss. Before I go into the details of the guide, I want to preface by clearing up a few misconceptions:

* Losing weight and cutting fat are the same thing:

Quite simply, they are not. Losing weight means lowering your *overall* body mass. This includes muscle and fat. Cutting fat (or just “losing body fat”) means getting rid of body fat at a controlled pace that allows you to maintain your muscle mass.

* Carbohydrates should be axed if you want to cut fat:

This is true and false. Yes, carbohydrates need to be cut down, but not overnight and certainly not as low as some people go. I will go into greater detail in the nutrition section below.

* Have a high fat intake is going to make you fat:

No, it’s not. There are healthy fats that are vital to the overall function of your body. Feed your body the right fats, and you won’t have an issue. Again, this will be covered under nutrition. 

I would like to say that while my knowledge of fat cutting will get you far, it is not a be all end all. There are many paths you can take to get to the same place, these are just the facts as I understand them, and my processes will teach you to cut fat the most efficient way I know how.

That said, my guide is going to recommend multiple techniques to maximize your fat loss and minimize your muscle gain. You do not have to follow every single suggestion, just keep in mind that the more careless you are on the path to a leaner body, the more likely you will lose muscle along the way.

NOTE: I am going to use “lingo” and concepts that assume you have already read the information in our FAQ. I recommend reading that before you read this, or I guarantee you will have questions.

###Methods of Measuring Body Fat Percentage:

__________

There are a ton of methods to measure body fat. The less expensive, generally, the less accurate. Some of the most popular:

* The mirror. If you have absolutely no tools, you can estimate your body fat using a picture such as [this](http://livelifeactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/bfpercentage.jpg) and the mirror. Just keep in mind that body fat appearance will vary from person to person on how they ""carry"" it, and it will vary on how much muscle mass you [have](http://www.leighpeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/10-percent-body-fat-male-pictures1.jpg).

* Measuring tape method. All you need is measuring tape. You just measure your waist, and sometimes hips and neck, put it in a [calculator](http://fitness.bizcalcs.com/Calculator.asp?Calc=Body-Fat-Navy), and that should give you a measurement within ~3%.

* Calipers. Can be bought for as cheap as $4-5. There are multiple methods to calculate your body fat using them, which can be found [here](http://www.linear-software.com/online_old.html). This should give you a measurement at least within ~2%.

* BOD POD. Can be expensive depending on where it is done, but my university does them for $15. It's a very accurate method done using air pressure on the body. Should measure within ~0.5-1%.

* DEXA Scan. Currently the most accurate method, and also the most expensive. If you are willing to shell out the money for this method, you will get a measurement within ~0.1%.

____________

###Before Starting Your Fat Cutting Plan:

_______

I’m sure that you’ve been gaining and working out for a long time. It’s very important that before you start operating a caloric deficit that you stabilize your new weight. 

To do this, start eating at a “maintenance” level, or exactly at your TDEE. For the first week, continue your workout routine at the same level you would if you were trying to gain. 

For the second and final week, continue eating at maintenance and don’t work out for the entire week. Yes, you heard me right. If you’ve been working out for longer than 10-12 weeks, I can guarantee that your body has been over-trained to some degree. Before you try to cut the fat, you need to make sure your body is *fully* recovered. During this time, you should do nothing but very light cardio (walking) and stretching.

On the note of recovery, make sure that you are always getting 7-9 hours of sleep to optimize your fat loss.

Once these two weeks are complete, you should be stabilized at your current weight and ready to take on your new cutting routine.

_______

###Nutrition:

_______

If you’ve been following our advice on /r/gainit for a while now, you know that we encourage eating 500 calories over your TDEE. Now, to start your cutting diet, I am going to recommend that you do the exact same, but in reverse! Lower your calories by 500 below your TDEE, and you will now be in a caloric deficit. 

Now, you might be asking yourself “that’s simple, why bother making a guide to tell me that?” The answer is simply lowering your calories is not enough to make sure you cut fat. Putting yourself in caloric deficit is only enough to ensure that you are *losing weight.* 

The first technique to efficiently cut fat is to properly manage your macros. When gaining, you can be a little looser with your macros and still see average results, but when cutting, your macro ratios are much more vital to your success. Let’s go over each macro:

**Carbohydrates:**

When gaining, we recommend that you eat as healthy as possible, but most of us “cheat” or “go dirty” and eat foods that aren’t as nutritional for the convenience. I want to get it out of the way and emphasize this now: **you will not be very successful cutting body fat and maintaining muscle mass unless your diet is completely clean.** 

That said, carbohydrates are still a very important component of your cutting diet. I’ve cut a few times, and I have found the best way to find your starting amount of carbs is to eat 1g per pound of *lean* body mass.  So, if you are 20% body fat and weigh 200 lbs. you have 40 lbs. of body fat, you will have 160 lbs. of lean body mass. This means your ideal starting number is 160g a day. It’s that easy!

Now, you can eat your carbohydrates as you please throughout the day, but if you want a more advanced way to ensure fat it being burned, take advantage of nutrient timing. The best way to do this is to divide your carbs up for when your glycogen stores need to be replenished most:

* Breakfast – 25% of total daily carbs
* Pre-Workout – 25% of total daily carbs
* Post-Workout – 25% of total daily carbs
* The rest of the day – 25% of total daily carbs

Timing nutrients like this gives you a hormonal advantage and will optimize fat burning. 

The best sources of carbohydrates:

* Oatmeal
* Brown Rice
* Vegetables
* Whole Grain Pasta
* Sweet Potatoes
* Fruits

We all know fruits and vegetables are crucial to a nutritional diet. I have a rule for each. For fruit, only eat fruit during breakfast, pre-workout, and post-workout. These are the times that your body is less sensitive to insulin spikes, which **must** be minimized for fat loss. 

For vegetables, eat as much as you want. I’m serious. They are a free food. Don’t even count them in your calories for the day. They will give you vital micronutrients and will help to curb your appetite. Note that for this rule I am referring to the low-calorie, leafy, dark green vegetables, not the starchy vegetables such as corn, pototoes, and legumes.

Carbohydrates are also the key to keeping your progress from stagnating. Ideally you should be losing anywhere from 0.5-1.0% of your body fat a week. If you are in this range, then you are golden. Once you fall out of it, decrease your carbohydrates by 20-25g to continue your progress.

The last note on carbohydrates is to take advantage of an advanced technique known as “carb cycling.” This essentially means that every once in a while, for a single day you “re-feed” your body and restore your depleted glycogen by eating a larger amount of carbohydrates. My recommendation for these days is to eat an extra 40% of carbohydrates. So, from our above example where you would be eating 160g a day, if you wanted to re-feed, you would eat 224g that particular day. 

As for the frequency of re-feeds, this can only be dictated by your own experience. Those of you that have a tendency to lose muscle faster along with fat will need to have more frequent re-feeds, perhaps every 3-4 days. For those of you that have trouble cutting your body fat but maintain muscle well, you may want to space your re-feeds out to more like 7-14 days. The lower your carbohydrates for a single day go, the more crucial these re-feeds will be for maintaining your muscle mass.

**Protein:**

For protein intake, it is important to have a higher amount during periods of fat loss. My recommendation is to eat about 1.15-1.2g per pound of mass. Note that I say mass, as in total weight, not just lean mass. The only other thing to keep in mind about protein is that you want it as absolutely lean as possible. 

The best sources of protein: 

* Chicken 
* Egg Whites
* Fish
* Whey Isolate

**Fats:**

As for fat, you just need to fill in whatever calories are left over. So, our example from earlier would have you eating 160g of carbs and about 230g of protein. Let’s say your deficit goal is 2500 calories. Since you have 160x4=640 and 230x4=920, 920+640= 1560. That means your remaining 940 calories should come from fat. Since there are 9 calories per gram of fat, that equates to about 104.5g. 

The best sources of fats:

* Olive Oil
* Coconut Oil
* Natural Peanut Butter
* Assorted Nuts
* Flaxseed

_______

###Supplements:

_______

There are certain supplements that can further your goals. I would supplement with a multi-vitamin 3 times a day. I also recommend taking fish oils and vitamin C three times a day. A multi-vitamin will help to make sure your micronutrient requirements are sufficiently filled during the rough period of low caloric intake and Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help greatly as well. Fish Oils are great sources of polyunsaturated fat, but if you get a sufficient amount in your diet, they aren’t necessary.

I also take 5g of BCAA’s, 5g of Glutamine, and 2.5g of Creatine 4 times a day. These have long been circulated around the bodybuilding community as “muscle mass saviors” during cutting periods, and while they aren’t necessary, I highly recommend them (although they can be pricy!)

Note that while I've found those to be the best ranges for me, you may be different. Many prefer to limit their creatine to 5g a day (and it has negative bowel effects on some who go over that number). Glutamine is also questionable because it's an amino acid chain that you may already be getting a sufficient amount through your diet. 

Also take into consideration what you get through your protein powder. For example, I said I take 5g of BCAA's and 5g of Glutamine. I wrote 4 times a day to spread them as a side option, but if you are a user of Optimum Nutrition Whey, you will get 5.5g BCAAs and 7.1g Glutamine per scoop. Just something to keep in mind.

###Workout Routine:

________

This is going to be a lot more simple than you think. The way you maintain muscle during a cut it to keep doing exactly what you’ve been doing, just in a lower volume. Basically, just do less sets and reps, but keep the weight the same. 

For one example, say you squat 225 for 3x12. I would recommend dropping this to 225 for 2x10. Make sure to include some sets with heavy weights for low reps to maintain your current level of strength.

As for cardio, it’s up to personal preference. You can burn calories doing your weight routine, but you can increase your daily calories burned by adding in cardio on the same day, or you can do cardio on your off days. If you choose to do cardio the same day as your weight routine, I recommend spacing them out as far as possible from one another.

Ask them all ill add your question to first post so it doesnt keep coming back over and over. 

Chicken Fajitas:
Super simple recipe. I do this once every 2-3 weeks and make a few to freeze and have ready whenever I want. 

**Things youll need:**
Ziplock bags
White round flower tortilla
Chicken breast
Fajita seasoning 
Cheese (your pick)
Cooked Beans (I dont like these so dont use them)

**Optional:**
Sour cream, Salad,green peppers, guacamole 

**Cooking:**
Night before!!!
Start by thawing your chicken and slicing it in to strips and mix in your Fajita mix! Throw a little olive oil in there too. 

Next day!!
get two pans!, set your heat to medium low, let it get warm. Get your chicken out and start to cook it on one pan. Turn it fairly constantly

Grab the tortilla and cut them in half and throw a little cheese in there. Once your chicken is done, throw it on the tortilla, more cheese, wrap and throw it on that second pan. Make sure to watch them dont burn or stick. You may have to lower the heat. 

once they are done (browning tortilla) set them aside and let them cool down.

Throw in a ziplock in the freeze. 2 minutes on half power microwave and you have got Fajitas. Want some extra zing and cals? Add sour cream, salad or guacamole. 

Need a side dish? Make 3/4 cup of rice, quinoa or anything else in your rice cooker.

Worked out here and there and never got anything from it so never really continued (I was impatient).  Finally got a membership at a good gym and got a buddy to help me get started.  Finally happy about not being the skinny kid after a year, but still looking for a little more.  [Progress Pic](http://i.imgur.com/9cJvBg8.png) Additional after back [PIC](http://i.imgur.com/peke1un.jpg) sorry I don't have a before.

I was told to post this here for you guys.

I'm 23 y/o, 6 ft 2 inches


Skinny Picture I was around 155
After picture I weighed in at 184.  


Food wise:
Being the kid who could stay skinny no matter what I ate I took to the food route.  Eat as much High Protein stuff as I can (try to be clean stuff). Lean chicken and turkey can be your best friend.  I make a salsa chicken in the crock pot all the time.  Pretty cheap and easy. 
* 2lbs of chicken
* 10oz can of creme of chicken soup
* 16oz jar/can of salsa
Mix the two cans together pour over the chicken and cook on low for 6ish hours.  Shred the chicken and put back into crockpot, add 2 spoonfuls of sour cream to the mix and eat.  Its great over rice, by itself or with totilla chips.


The only Supplement I added was a protein shake after I worked out. None of that fancy super fancy stuff just some cheap stuff from [GNC](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3267268&amp;cp=3593187.2108294), only $50 for a 5lb container with around 71 servings (one scoop) I usually took two scoops/


Basic routine breakdown.
**Monday**
Chest exercises 
**Tuesday**
Back and Shoulders
**Wednesday**
Legs
**Thursday**
Random stuff I felt like working more on that week.
**Friday Saturday Sunday**
These were usually rest days, but sometimes I would go in and do some stuff still, and sometimes start the week over early depending on how I felt.


I can't really tell you exercises I did cause it changed a lot along with the big stuff that everyone knows for each muscle group.  When you get bored of what you're doing look up videos online of the muscle group your going to work out next and do those exercises you don't always do.


Find a friend to help you when you get started.  I got lucky and had a buddy who was a football player for a small college who was will to work out with the weak kid and got me started.  It also gives you a great reason to keep going if you have someone that will make you go.


The biggest thing it takes is persistence, keep working even when you think you're not getting anywhere.  Change stuff up and continue to try new exercises.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_17hzsv,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/17hzsv/one_year_progress_after_i_decided_i_was_sick_of/,

I stayed around there for a couple of years until November of 2011, when I finally decided to do something about my size/weight.

**This will be a long post, since it's two bulks and a cut.**

This is my progress from November '11 until today. I have bulked twice throughout almost two years, cut once, so I'll try to hit the details of both bulks.

I am 6'1'', 21 years old, and of course, a male.
I started bulking at 135lbs and I [weighed in under 188](http://i.imgur.com/YSP8oxG.jpg) (with a belly full of water and some sweaty shorts/tank). So I'm around 180-182lbs currently.

I'll start with a few pictures of myself before my first bulk.

* [First](http://i.imgur.com/rutE981.jpg)
* [Second](http://i.imgur.com/2jaUq6A.jpg)

In November of 2011, I was motivated by the other soldiers in my section to go workout with them. It was the typical Chest/Tri day and I could barely bench press 65 pounds, so I was feeling kind of unmotivated, but they kept pushing me through it. The next day was Back/Bi day and I think that was when I fell in love with going to the gym. Ever since then, I would do my best to never miss a day of lifting (unless I wanted a rest week or whatever).

For the next couple of months (November until June-2012), I bulked. My workout routine was just a generic 

* Monday- Chest/Tri, 
* Tuesday- Back/Bi
* Wednesday- Off
* Thursday- Chest/Tri
* Friday- Back/Bi
* Sat/Sun- Off

That's right. I **NEVER** did legs or shoulders and looking back on that, it was the dumbest decision I think I've ever chose. My diet consisted of the GOMAD diet on top of whatever else I ate throughout the day. (Sorry if I'm not going into too much detail, it was over a year ago so my memory is fuzzy on what exactly I ate all day). But doing the GOMAD and eating regularly alone bumped me up to 165lbs. I started taking creatine and eating 4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before bed with a casein protein shake. In June of 2012, I finally weighed over 170lbs. So that's 35 pounds that I've gained in a little over half a year. I looked like this:

* [170ish pounds](http://i.imgur.com/KnlBVLm.jpg)
* [Again](http://i.imgur.com/1MkrVuI.jpg)

I decided the best thing for me to do would be to cut once I hit 170lbs, so that's what I did. I can tell you what I remember of my diet. I completely cut out fatty foods and dairy. I completely got rid of milk from my diet. The only fat that I would take in would be ranch from whenever I was eating carrots or broccoli. I stopped taking creatine as well. I still kept my diet high in protein, so I'd still be eating a ton of tuna and chicken, as well as taking protein shakes, but this time with only water. I ended up cutting back down to 155lbs (kind of sad because I felt like I was starting back at the bottom). I believe it was August/September whenever I took this picture at the end of my cut:

* [sorry about the shitty quality, my phone broke and I was using an old flip phone a friend let me have](http://i.imgur.com/zhjmHmx.jpg)


so from just cutting creatine/fats out of my diet, I lost a lot of my fat and well, my weight in general. BUT, it wasn't the end of the world. I maintained that weight, fluctuating from 155 to 160, even getting down to 150lbs at one point. Late in January/early February 2013, I decided it was time to bulk again. I started on the basic **5x5 stronglifts** and this time I can tell you exactly what I ate with this neato meal plan picture:

* [woooooooo](http://i.imgur.com/su28JtK.jpg)

Meal 5 was [this shake](http://caloriecount.about.com/retooled-svunt-shake-recipe-r1115661) and I would only take that one days where I worked out and I'd try to drink it right before bed.
Now I didn't always stick to the meal plan. Sometimes it would be easier to have some mcdoubles and a milkshake after a workout, so I'd do that. But I always tried to make sure I hit above 3k calories. The meal plan for the most part is a cleaner bulk one, but there were times where I would just eat whatever I could because I didn't have the money to keep buying all of those items. So mcdoubles, mcchickens, milkshakes, 5 layer burritos, 5 soft fresca style tacos, etc. would become my friend for whenever I was starving and wanted something cheap. (I know, I know, they aren't the best things to eat) After eating all of that though, my stomach suffered from it and I grew a gut. My girlfriend would never say anything about it, 'cause she's super duper nice, but eventually my mom told me that I had a gut (Which struck me as funny, since I've been real skinny the past 20 years of my life).

**SORRY THAT THIS IS GETTING SUPER LONG, BUT IT'S GOING TO GET A BIT LONGER. SINCE I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU MY WORKOUT ROUTINE**

I was seeing my strength gains, but not my size, so after a couple of months I switched to this new lifting routine and I'll tell you the weight I'm using in it:

* ***$ = ramp up the weight every set.***

**Monday Upper A - Heavy Horizontal/Lighter Vertical**- 

* Incline DB Press 5x5$ (80lb dumbbells for the last set)
* Bench 5x5$ (I think it hit a little over 200lbs on my last set)
* BB Row 5x5$ (180 for the last set)
* OH Press 3x10 (80lbs for these sets, since I'm usually worn out from the incline bench)
* Pullups - 3x10
* BB Curl - 2x8 (70lbs)
    

**Tuesday Lower A - Heavy Squats /hamstring assistance and core**- 

* Squats- 5x5$ (I did 300 for my last set, but ended up doing 10reps and I could have done more, so I don't think I'm pushing myself hard enough)
* Lying hamstring curls 3x8 (100lbs)
* Back hyper-extensions 3x10
* Calf Raises 3x20 (over 200 pounds)
* abs 


**Wednesday - Rest**



**Thursday Upper B - Heavy Vertical/Lighter Horizontal**-

* Press 5x5$ (135 for last set)
* Weighted Pullup 5x5 (sometimes I do closegrip chin ups for bicep width with 45lbs)
* Incline DB Bench 3x10 (70 lb dumbbells)
* Bench 3x10 (160lbs)
* BB Row 3x10 (140lbs)
* Weighted Dips 2x8 (with 80lbs)


**Friday Lower B - Heavy Deadlift/lighter quad and core**- 

* Deadlift 5x5$ (320lbs with the last set)
* Leg Press 4x10$ (400lbs with the last set)
* Leg extensions 3x10 (around 150lbs I think)
* Calf Raises 5x20 (leg press machine with around 200lbs)
* abs

**Saturday - Rest**

**Sunday - Rest**





and that's pretty much it. Squats/Deadlifts I do barefoot so I can feel it a bit more in my calf muscles (they've grown a bit over half an inch since I've started doing this). With abs, I just do whatever I feel like doing for that day, whether it be Hanging Pikes or Dragon Flags, or weighted decline sit-ups. I do incline benches before my regular benches because my upper chest was underdeveloped compared to the rest of my chest. Here's a squat picture (with a towel cause I'm a wuss and my friend took the picture on my way up)
 
* [300lb squat](http://i.imgur.com/f7yIwG2.jpg)

I plan on reaching 200lbs by next march while still bulking. From that point on, I'll see if I want to continue bulking or if I want to begin cutting. I will update you whenever I decide it, if there is any interest in it.

Anyway, sorry for this being to lengthy, if I missed anything or you guys have any questions, let me know.

When I joined this community, I knew very little about nutrition, let alone bulking.  The FAQ is a good guide for how to gain weight but it doesn't always give the why behind our recommendations.  Also, I know that it took me some time to learn the lingo used here and even google was unreliable (macros? micros?).  The information I've laid out below is what I've taken as the major points for someone new to gaining and to lifting in general.  If you guys/gals think that the below is useful, perhaps we can update the FAQ with some of the information.  Finally, as a novice myself, input from the more knowledgeable members of the community is greatly appreciated as it's inevitable that I have some misinformation here.







**Diet**



This is the most important component.  Food fuels the building of your body.  In order of importance:


1. Caloric Goal.  Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the average amount of calories you burn each day including the energy needed to process food.  It's a combination of what your Basal Metabolic Rate (BSR aka what your body burns to keep you alive) plus any physical activity you complete that day.  You can get an approximation of your TDEE using [this](http://users.telenet.be/WBtE/cunning.html) or other calculators.  Bulking is eating above your TDEE (typically about +500).  Cutting is eating below TDEE (typically about -500).  Maintenance is eating at your TDEE.  A general bulking start point is 3000 calories/day for men or 2500 calories/day for women.  Weigh yourself regularly and adjust your goal so that you're gaining roughly 1 lbs week.  



2. Macros.  Macronutrients are protein (amino acids), fat (fats), and carbohydrates (starches/sugars).  Using your caloric goal, aim for that goal to be met with approximately 30% protein, 30% fat, and 40% carbohydrates.  The 30/30/40 split is a general guideline and you may find that adjustments are needed to best suit your specific needs.



3. Micros. Micronutrients are vitamins/minerals/etc.  With your macros in mind, pick foods that are nutrient dense.




With the above in mind, certain foods start to stand out as very strong choices.  Examples: Oats, Chicken, Whole Milk, Beans, Nuts, Vegetables.  



Supplements: Supplements are exactly what they sound like, supplemental additions to your main diet.  Supplements can help to fill in the gaps that you struggle to reach with normal food.  For example, protein powder can be used to reach your protein macro goal.



High Metabolism: People with ""high metabolisms"" only burn about 200 calories more per day than the average.  200 calories is a couple tablespoons of peanut butter.  In other words, this is not a reason you are not gaining.






**Fitness**



With the diet portion under control, a proper exercise regiment encourages the body to build muscle rather than store fat.



1. Form.  Form is number one.  Read as much as you can about proper form and ask someone at your gym to check you.  Video tape yourself if you have the ability to do so.  Improper form can cause injury and, if you have poor posture, make it tougher to correct your posture later.



2. Frequency. Three times a week, at least 1 rest day between exercises for a particular muscle group.  Consistency is key.  During the rest days your body is rebuilding itself, robbing it of this recovery time will slow your progress.  After proper recovery, you should be able to either workout longer, lift heavier weights, or push out more reps than before.  If you cannot do one of these, you have not fully recovered.



3. Style.  Full body workout.  Focus on exercises, such as compound lifts, that engage your major muscle groups and the smaller stabilizer muscles around them.  This is the most efficient use of your workout time and energy.



4. Method.  Aim for 3-5 sets of 5-8 reps for each exercise each workout.  Rest for 90 to 180s between sets.  The last few reps of your last set should be very tough and take everything you have left.  The rep and rest ranges are geared to balance gaining both [strength and size (hypertrophy)](http://imgur.com/mvMuFAN).



5. Recovery. Your body is made up of more than just muscles (immune system, Central Nervous System, hormonal system, etc.) and effective gaining requires that they also get the requisite recovery time.  Every 9-15 weeks (depending on level of conditioning) take a full week off exercise and reduce calories back to a maintenance level.  




With the above in mind, certain routines (Starting Strength, Strong Lifts, Reddit Bodyweight Fitness FAQ workout) and exercises (Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift, Pull Ups, Push Ups, etc.) become strong choices.






**Tips**



* Track everything you eat at first to gain an accurate guage of how many calories foods have.  Sites such as [myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com) are great for this.



* Track your workouts.  Looking back and seeing how far you've come is a great motivator.  A notebook or a site like [Fitocrarcy](http://www.fitocrarcy.com) work well for this.



* It may be tough to change your diet at first.  Consider eating a workout.  You will need to eat when you're not hungry.  You might not like it and you may struggle towards the end of it.  However, if you're consistent, your body will acclimate.  After a week or two, you will find that you're hungrier and that you can eat more than before.



* Plan your meals out ahead of time.  Cook them ahead of time if you find yourself often crunched for time after a long day.



* Listen to your body.  If an exercise hurts (not in the good way) back off, find out why.  As a follow up, don't make an injury worse.  In the long run, it's often better to take the time off to let it heal now rather than try to fix it later.



* Allow yourself small food cheats occasionally.  Don't go nuclear with your diet.  It's okay to eat cookies, beer, cake, etc. on occasion.  Just keep them as treats, not staples of your diet.



* The other people at the gym don't care that you're small.  Don't be intimidated.  You're there bettering yourself, that's what matters.  The strong guys there weren't always strong.



* Don't sweat the small stuff.  It's cliche but true.  If your lifts stall or your weight stalls, don't worry about it.  Everyone has bad days.  Maintain your program for another week (or two).  If you're still not seeing any gain, make small adjustments, not big ones.  



* Your rest days should get as much attention as your workout days.  A hard workout tears your muscles down while recovery days rebuild it.  As such, take recovery seriously.  Maintain a regular sleep schedule that allows you to get a full nights rest.  Keep stress at manageable level.  These lifestyle changes are the stabilizer muscles to the major muscles of eating and lifting.

Need a place to vent.,islamicorange,217,40,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1k3vcz/some_people_at_the_gym_are_fucking_assholes_need/,"Ok so this is partially my fault for not asking someone to spot me. But I need a place to vent. 

I'm at the gym and I'm on strong lifts program. I just finished my squats and head over to bench press. I successfully did my sets the previous workout so I increase and place 50 lbs on each side. 

I begin my workout and when I'm on my last set 4th rep my arms completely shut down on me. I honestly don't know why because I didn't feel tired and it was fairly easy. The barbell collapses on my chest and I'm trying  my hardest to lift it but nothing happens and I'm struggling. 

I start yelling for help but nobody comes over. The trainer was not in the room but there were well over 15 people. I look to my left and I see a woman staring. I don't mind her not helping because she probably thinks she can't lift the barbell but she could've told someone. I look to my right and some guy on the Smith machine is staring at me while he continues to workout. 

It's now 2 minutes later and I try to throw my weight to the right so the whole barbell collapses but i cant move. I'm losing feeling in my chest. I'm thinking what the fuck this has to be a dream, I mean I was in shock nobody was helping. 

I start yelling again this time I yelled, ""are you people fucking blind? Help me!"" 

Suddenly some guy comes in and helps. He said heard me me from the cardio room, which is all the way on the other side of the gym in a different room. 

I thank him and leave. Go home and feel like I'm going to cry, I'm such a bitch at this point. Don't know if I can go for a while. It feels like I'm in a mildly traumatized state. I just don't know if I'm overreacting or what but I'm still in a little shock.

His personal website included many different products and fitness routines, for a charge. In particular, he was pushing the ""Body Beast"" program, from the parent company ""Beach Body."" 

Feeling something was off with the post, I took did some quick digging and stumbled on [this](http://www.teambeachbody.com/coach/faq). Apparently, Beach Body has ""coaches"" that are able to start their own websites, and are paid to sell you Beach Body products. Taken from the above link:

&gt; **How do I earn money?**
&gt;
&gt;You get paid weekly commissions when people buy Beachbody products and Team Beachbody Club memberships through your personal website. You can also earn cash bonuses based on your team’s sales.

Interestingly enough, this wasn't the first time the user had posted this. He posted a topic 24 days ago (which was also removed), and posted in a few topics suggesting his program to our users. Quite simply, this sort of behavior is not going to be tolerated.

Many of the users of /r/gainit are beginners. Those of us who are more experienced know how overwhelming all of the misinformation in the fitness community can be when starting out. The last thing we need are salesmen coming on here trying to push their products onto users just trying to get help.

I'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that our FAQ is considered a comprehensive guide on gaining lean mass. It has everything you need to know to get started, including workout routines, diet information, recovery information, other general information, tips, frequently asked questions, external links, etc. Best of all, **it's 100% FREE.**

In conclusion, I would just like to reiterate the main point I am getting at here. **Posting with the intention of selling products to our users, whether direct or indirect is subject to moderation. Repeat offenses are subject to a permanent ban from /r/gainit.**

Here's the [link](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=130254443&amp;page=1) if you're interested. I think it's fair to say that unless you want to experiment with anabolic steroids, the physiques of pro bodybuilders are not attainable.

These numbers at around 10% body fat are attainable naturally. Also keep in mind that these numbers take years of dedication to reach.

* 158 cm	/	69	kg
* 163 cm	/	73	kg
* 168 cm	/	78	kg

* 183 cm	/	93	kg
* 188 cm	/	98	kg
* 193 cm	/	103	kg
* 198 cm	/	108	kg

or in US measures,

* 5'0”	/	143	lb
* 5'2”	/	153	lb
* 5'4”	/	162	lb
* 5'6”	/	173	lb

* 6'0”	/	205	lb
* 6'2”	/	216	lb
* 6'4”	/	228	lb
* 6'6”	/	240	lb

The numbers are based on scientific research and not just something I pulled out of my ass. They come from a [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7496846) that suggests that the natural Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI similar to BMI but for lean body mass instead of total mass) for natural bodybuilders is about 25. I am not excluding the possibility of complete genetic freaks that go beyond this, but if someone is bigger than these weights at 10% body fat, I think it is fair to suspect steroid usage.

Having spent a year bulking, I feel burdened and weighed down with wisdom like a bee who has gathered too much pollen.  So I am here to share it and unload it upon ye disciples of the gains.  **So feel free to ask me anything.**

I read Starting Strength and got with its program in May and stuck with it until late August. Then I read Jamie Lewis's book, ""Destroy the Opposition"", and it motivated me to up my gym time from 3 days a week to 5 days and to make time for my accessories. I also upped my deadlift volume based on Jamie's recommendation to include 5 sets of 6 reps (though I've now dropped it to 5 reps).

I got in the habit of going to the gym at 5:30 pm every day which allowed me to see the same general crowd of lifters. I started to make friends and eventually found my now current lifting buddy and coach in late October. He's a bodybuilder and I'm now on a routine where we do a 5 day body part split in which we do our heavy barbell lifts first (strength training) and then focus on lifts for hypertrophy and machines after we're spent on the weights. My lifting buddy's form is flawless and he's been an awesome resource and support. 

As far as diet goes, shit's not that complicated.  Make getting at least a gram of protein per pound on your body weight the priority, how ever you want to do that.  Don't think that just because fatties fear carbs that carbs will be your savior, make sure to get a lot of fat in there too.  

My diet is for a lazy person that pretty much just understands calories in and out; I suggest you do better than me.  

I have base meals I consume each day and change it up a little for one meal (sometimes two).  I buy all my base meals at Costco for cheap.

- [Breakfast 10 AM] 
A. Costco Blueberry Muffin: (Carbs) 612 Calories
[$7 for 12 (freeze them)]
B. Muscle Milk 3 scoops: (Protein)(Fat) 48 grams of protein, 27 grams of fat, 525 Calories

Total: 1,137 Calories 

No Lunch 

- [Dinner 5 PM] 
Aim for 1000+ calories 
For instance: A Chipotle pork burrito with everything has 1135 Calories, 54 grams of protein, 52 grams of fat ($8).

- [8:30]
2 Cooked Cups of Organic Short Grain Brown Rice (carbs), 720 calories, 12 grams of protein.

- [10:00]
A. 2 Cups of large curd cottage cheese (fat), 432 Calories, 56 grams of protein. [3 large cottage cheese tubs for 13 dollars at Costco]  
B. 1 1/2 table spoons of Metamucil Fiber.     

- [11:30 PM]
Muscle Milk 3 scoops: (Protein)(Fat) 48 grams of protein, 27 grams of fat, 525 Calories [I buy a $32 bag of Muscle Milk at Costco once a week]

Total Calories: 3949
Total Protein: 218 grams

I've pretty much been doing this for 6 months now and more repetitive meal patterns the previous 6 months.  I hate making food and I hate cleaning it even more, this stuff is easy to do and not that expensive.  


Now for my story: 

A year ago I decided I wasn't going to finally fill out by just sitting around doing my normal routine.  I'm not sure what finally pushed me to do it, but probably being somewhat hipsterish and growing to hate the culture surrounding it helped push me over the edge.  I went to the Dr. before I got started to get my blood tested to find out if something was wrong with my thyroid.  He said that the thyroid did not show up irregular in the results, but that I did have Stage 2 Special Snowflake Syndrome.  I decided to turn to Reddit for help and learned about calories in and out and that it's not my metabolism, but my 12 year old girl appetite holding me back.  And so I crafted a pretty lazy diet around that simple principle.  I really really do hate food after this bulk, I feel bad for fatties who do this for fun, god help them.

The great passion I have found in all of this is lifting.  Lifting is what has made this all bearable.  To all of you who want to get fit in your home if you are new, just STAHP.  Go to a gym where people lift heavy and go work hard and be consistent.  The internet will never be the kind of support system you need.  I don't lift with headphones, because I like to be receptive to people at the gym and open to making friends; people were doing just fine without headphones in the 70's.  The internet is great for getting some pure doctrine in regards to good form and good programs.  But avoid the dogmatism the internet breeds and be receptive to wisdom that the bigger guys or stronger guys at your gym can share.  

For instance, while I was deadlifting this middle aged guy was staring at me, I asked ""Hey what did you think of my form?"" He said he was worried about how my arms were bending, I had him watch me again, and he was like, never mind, I guess that's just how tall people with long arms do it.  He's now one of the people who I briefly talk to at the gym every time he's there.  

I want to build my body and increase my strength, so I do my power lifts like a power lifter and my other lifts and accessories like a bodybuilder.  Pretty simple.  The powerlifts have done wonders for my back, ass, and legs.  The accessories have done good things for my upperbody (chest, traps, and lats).

My numbers are meh: 

Squat - 280

Deadlift - 375

Bench - 215


By May or June I'd like to be at a 3 plate squat, a 4 plate deadlift, and over a 2 plate bench.  We'll see.

It would have saved me from the deepest depression of my life, and I know there are people who are still struggling.",willworkfourkarma,188,22,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1dg5vx/if_you_struggle_with_gaining_weight_make_sure_you/,"A little backstory:

I was always a smaller kid in my class. Around 5'10"", 125lbs at my average. Two years ago I made a decision to put on weight, but I struggled with it. I found myself barely even able to eat the lightest of meals. Everytime I would eat, I would feel full to the point of nausea. I got depressed. I didn't know why I couldn't eat. Doctors told me I was healthy. I felt healthy even! But everytime I would look at food, or think about food, then would come the nausea. This lead to me smoking weed, getting drunk a lot of nights just to eat (obviously not healthy choices).

Fast forward to two months ago, I am back in my hometown after dropping out of school for this semester. Still struggling everyday with food. I am talking to a psychologist and on medication trying everyday just to make it to another day. It was the lowest point of my life. I felt worthless. And I couldn't eat. I'm changing everything in my diet, from the foods I'm eating, to the amount of salt on my food, to the amount of ice in my water, anything! I was looking for any answer to my issues but I couldn't find one.

Then last Monday, I was reading online about dehydration causing issues in hunger, appetite, and digestion overall. So I monitored how much I was drinking and figured around 64 oz a day. Little did I know I was drinking about half the recommended amount for a guy my size. So what have I done since? The past week I've around doubled my intake (drinking around 100oz a day now) and it has been a COMPLETE 180. I am hungry at almost all points of the day. I find myself thinking of food in a good light, actually wanting to eat (mind you I haven't felt like this since I was 18 and I'm 21 now). I'm finally happy in life, and I know it's still early, but it just feels so good! So good to get this off my chest, so good everything!

I know there are people still struggling. I talked to many people online when I was looking for help. Many of them were struggling with the same issues as me (not being able to eat, not feeling hungry) and I have a feeling many of them are simply dehydrated, not all but many. If this saves even one person, or gives one person the feeling the I have right now, I will be the happiest person in the world! Or maybe I already am :)

But please, if you know anyone struggling to eat and they want to eat more but they can't, ask them to check their water drinking levels. I can't describe the euphoria and relief I've felt, but please! You could literally save a life. Please upvote for the love of others, and I get no karma from this post!

I'll keep it short because i know some people have a low attention span

I'll cut to the chase with an album from January 2012 - April 2013

Here is me in High School &amp; January 2012 [@ 148](http://imgur.com/a/va3cp)

Here are the pictures i took 5 minutes ago [@185ish](http://imgur.com/a/TxDMI)

&gt;**stats**

- Bench 1RM 95lbs to 240lbs (230 - 3 second pause)

- Squat 180ish to 440 RAW

- Deadlift - 200ish to 469 RAW (no straps, chalk only)

- OHP - 60ish to 185lbs

- 54"" box jump

&gt;**goals for this year**

- 275 bench

- 475 squat

- 500 deadlift

- 200 OHP


&gt;**Workout Routine**

- started on a modified SS, learned how power-lift. I didn't read the book, i just followed the basic routine. I did a lot of machines to build of a base strength. I watched a lot of youtube tutorials as well.

- After about 2 months i started a monthly progression routine called Wendlers 5/3/1. This was sort of a mistake as when you're a beginner it's better to do a weekly progression routine, but oh well. I added about 10-15lbs a month on the squat and deadlift, but at the beginning i added upwards of 30lbs. I added 5-10lbs on the bench and OHP. Later on i'd be lucky to add 2.5lbs or 5lbs a month.

- the best routine is the one that you stick to and actually follow consistently. I think people get too caught up in trying to find the perfect routine. Hard work and consistency is way more important. As a basic guide 8-12 reps will get ya bigger, and 1-5 reps will get you stronger, but you won't notice the difference until wayyyy down the line. They both will get you bigger and stronger at the beginning so don't worry about it too much 


&gt;**Diet**

- the absolute reason how i accomplished what i did, was because i didn't fuck around with diet. If you aren't gaining the way you want it's more than likely because you're making excuses in the kitchen. My bulk hovered around between 3300-4000- calories. I tried gainer shakes for a couple months but eventually i decided i hated them. I have eaten until i felt sick, waited 30 minutes and ate some more. 

- My main sources of protein were - Chicken Thighs, Steak, Hamburger, Whey Protein 2% milk and Soy milk

- My main sources of Carbs were - Rice, Bread etc.

- My main fats were - Oils, Chunky PB.

- I ate a decent amount of Fast Food like maybe 5 times a week but really the only thing i'd eat was chicken fingers, and chicken burgers.

- my favorite meals were BBQ's chicken on rice, Eggs on Hashbrowns, PB&amp;J sandwiches, Stirfrys, and this weird hamburger meal thingy i'd eat over rice. It basically was 1 pound of hamburger, veggies, soy sauce and eggs served over 1cup of rice. 

- i took 5g creatine daily, and no you don't need to cycle or load it. At first i didn't take a pre-workout but i currently take No-Xplode, it's alright, but it's not worth the money in my mind. If you want a quick pick-me-up go to your local drugstore and pick up caffeine tablets, 200mg is about the limit, however you can take as much as you want. My whey brand of choice is Gold Standard. 

**i'll tell you this right now, if you don't look after your diet, you might as well quit right now, because it means you're not being serious, so save yourself the grief**

- i found the easiest way to consistantly reach my caloric/macronutrient goals was to eat basically the same thing every day, with small variations. 

&gt;**TIPS**

- soy milk is a great alternative to regular milk. I think GOMAD is the most fucked up thing i've ever heard in my entire life, but do whatever you gotta do i'm not your mom...and no it doesn't cause your estrogen levels to spike

- yes deadlifts and squats build up your abs and core strength, but no it's not enough. Weighted sit-ups, hanging leg raises, ab wheels, planks are my favorite.

- do not ignore your glutes and hamstrings, they are arguably more important than your quads. Hip Thrusts, Leg curls, glute/ham raises, lunges. Do that shit

- if you are just starting out, don't tell everyone you know you are working out and going to the gym and updating your facebook status every day reminding everyone. I think it's this weird psychological thing where you never follow through afterwards. On top of that people don't give a shit. I didn't tell anyone i was going to the gym for months, people started asking if i was lifting after about 3 months.

- **full fucking range of motion**, quarter squats, half ROM bench, even if you curl without fully stretching and contracting the weight is almost a waste of time, and everyone is making fun of you behind your back because of it (people say you don't notice other people in the gym, that's a lie)

- don't be afraid to lift heavy if powerlifting is your thing, its a mental thing. You need to tell yourself to not be afraid and lift it.

- don't be afraid of alcohol, i drank 2-3 times a month and i had no problem 

- set goals, and have a good idea what you want to do at the gym for the week. Fuckarounditis is not only bad for your gains, but it kills you mentally. If you don't have a plan,  you are wayy more likely to skip your workouts. Also if you have anxiety at the gym, this a good way to fix it. 

- yes, high metabolisms exist, but the difference between high and low is really minimal (&gt;300cal at the very most, and those people only make up something like 1% of the population). Your skinnny because you don't lift, and don't eat...and no you think you eat a ton because you're full, but bulking means you eat until your full, and you do that 3-4 times a day.

- **i'll update this whenever it think of another helpful tip**

- for calf raises, pause at the bottom, then pause at the top. I see way too many people loading up 5 plates on the seated calf raise, then bouncing it up and down for 10 reps.

- for every lifts, you need to be explosive. Even if you are approaching your max, and the weight is crawling up, you need to act like you are trying to push that weight through the roof. Not being explosive will cause you a lot of failed reps.

- don't be a douchebag and go around giving everyone advice. Even if your advice is 100% spot on, you just look like a jackass. The only acceptable time to intervene in someones workout is if they are in immediate danger.

- i personally think you should be in the gym for 45-60 minutes if you are working hard, and upwards of 2 hours if you take your time and talk with people there. Personally i take about 2 hours, but i am some what of a chatty guy at the gym.

- BREATHE when you lift. Inhale on the negative, exhale on the positive. Hold your breath during heavy lifts.

- socks, chuck taylors or flat soled shoes for deadlifts and squats. Some people like raised heels when they squat so squat on 2 ten pound plates or get olympic lifting shoes.

http://www.food.com/recipe/breakfast-burritos-once-a-month-cooking-30165

I tripled the recipe in some regards, doubled it in others. Here's my ingredient list:

36 eggs

2 pounds sausage (in the fat tubes)

4 cups (2 packages) shredded cheddar

1 jar (2 cups) medium salsa

1 large white onion

2 green bell peppers

2 tomatoes

2 cans (4 oz each) diced green chiles

40 ten-inch tortillas

1 package of 20 frozen hashbrowns (they look like the mcd's ones)

Chop all veggies, mix in a bowl with the salsa and chiles. Set aside. Separately cook the following: Whip eggs with a dash of milk. Scramble them, adding all the cheese towards the end. Cook the sausage until brown. Cook the hashbrowns to desired doneness on each side (easier if you have a skillet). 

Now, combine everything (veggie mixture, eggs, sausage) except the hashbrowns. I had to split into two bowls to do this cause it was so much fucking food. 

Cut a hashbrown in half and place it in the center of a tortilla. Use a half-cup measure to scoop the mixture on top of the hashbrown. Roll the burrito like this picture: http://static.home-ec101.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/How-to-Roll-a-Burrito.jpg

Freeze in a single layer on a greased cookie sheet, then wrap the frozen burritos in seran wrap. I further put the seran-wrapped burritos in freezer bags to protect flavor. To heat them up, I wrap 2 burritos in paper towels and microwave for 4 minutes.

Theyre not that big, and come out to ~350 cals per. So I drink two glasses of milk, and two of eat these on the road during my morning commute. Boom, 1000 calorie breakfast. No excuses for skipping breakfast when it's this easy.

**EDIT: Routine and Diet:**

**ROUTINE:** I try to get to the gym 4-5 days a week. Sometimes 3, sometimes 6. Depends on my schedule. I usually do two body parts per day. Always switching which two I match up, number of sets, different exercises, etc. I always try to do different shit as much as possible. And I keep everything at 6-8 reps per set. I try to keep away from machines as much as I can, but I do use them a little. I like any freeweight based exercises, and I have been trying to stick to more olympic style lifts in the past few months. The most important thing is just making sure you *get to the gym* no matter how tired you are or how many lame excuses your mind conjures up. I realize this isn't a day to day breakdown of everything I do, but it's a set of guidelines I try to follow no matter what. (again, short on time, sorry!)


**DIET**:
This is a pretty confusing subject on this subreddit sometimes. You guys on here would consire this a *dirty bulk*, but to me, bulking is bulking. If I want to eat a cheeseburger, I do. I do eat shitty shit sometimes, but I think the important thing is to balance a lot of non-shitty shit. I eat a ton of sweet potatoes, chicken, and pasta. 

My average week day is something like this:

**Breakfast 6:30am:** Serious Mass protein shake (with whole milk), 1 Greek Yogurt Cup, and either 2 pieces of toast, 2 eggo waffles, or a bagel. (although if I'm short on time I sometimes just do the shake and yogurt.)

**Before lunch (mid-morning) snacks ~10am:** 1 Clif bar (or builders bar), 1 banana

**Lunch ~11:30am:** Usually I eat either: a subway sub, a publix (my local grocery store) sub, or a chicken ""dinner"" with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese (also from publix). I split this meal in two. I eat half at lunch and half later.

**Post-Lunch snack ~2 or 3pm:** Another Clif bar and an apple.

**-Around 4pm I eat the second half of lunch**

**-Work out around 6:30 - 7:30 or 8:00pm** - Immediately after workout, drink another Serious Mass shake, usually mixed with water because I'm not about to carry around a jug of milk at my gym. 

**~8:30 - 9:00 pm:** Dinner. Chicken breast with pasta, or rice and veggies. A whole baked sweet potato (I just bake it and eat it whole with my hands. Because I don't give a fuck.)


**WEEKENDS** - Weekends are what usually kill my progress a little. I'm always out with friends, and it's not uncommon for me to not work out on Sat - Sun. I do try to still get to the gym if nothing's going on... I still keep my belly as full as I can no matter what, but it's usually by eating out at restaurants. Don't take any advice from me about weekends. :O



Keep in mind, this is a *general* schedule. Things change sometimes from day to day, but this is usually pretty accurate. I do not count calories, because I know my body very well. I know when to eat, how much to eat, and I can feel when I'm gaining or losing weight. I did some calculations based on that diet, and it looks like I'm around **3,750 - 4,500 calories per day**


I don't know what a ""macro"" is. I don't worry about being *too* *""dirty""* with my diet. I'm not one of those people who can write down every little thing I eat or do. I just know my body well enough. I make sure to keep myself balanced, **get to the gym**, and sleep well. I believe that's all you need to do, unless you're trying to be professional. 


**EDIT 2:**

ROUTINE
 I go 5 days a week for about 1.5 hours a day. Generally I lift heavy as possible while trying to get 6-8 reps for 3 sets.
Chest
 • Flat, inclined, and declined bench. ( I'll switch between dumbbell presses and bench presses every few weeks). • Dumbbell flys • Cable flys • Wolverines • Push ups
Back 
• Dead lifts • Rows • Lat pull downs • Wide grip weighted pull ups
Shoulders 
• Shoulder press (Dumbbells or bar) • Arnold press at a lighter weight • A few cable work outs • Shrugs with Dumbbells or the Smith machine.
Legs • Squats • Leg press • Squats • Hamstring curls • Squats • Calf raises.. My gym has a few machines for calf workouts that I use. • SQUATS
Biceps
• Weighted chin ups • Hammer curls • Push ups • I'll also use the cable machines and do curls there • 21s
Triceps 
• Weighted dips • Skull crushers • Push ups • Tricep pull downs • Close grip presses
As far as abs I try to do them every 3 days.  I do mason twists, waited sit ups with a medicine ball.  Scissors,  and 6 inches.

DIET:
I was really skinny from the start so I ate anything I could get my hands on.  My goal was to feel full all day.  It sucked at first but once you see gains it will motivate you.  I also did GOMAD for a month and a half and saw really good gains from it.  Now when I did it I didnt put on fat in one specific area it really just helped me fill out and look healthier (good genetics I guess).  I dont really want to add any more fat to my body so now I try to eat healthier. A lot of meats, eggs, oatmeal, milk, fruits and vegetables are all things I try to eat on a daily basis.

Supplements:

I take a weight gainer called Muscle Juice.  If I dont get enough calories for the day I'll mix this with a banana, peanut butter, and whole milk.  Its around 1000 calories.

Recently, I've been thinking about exploring the limits of gaining around my lifestyle. There are so many people looking for the quickest way to gain, without having to sacrifice money, time etc. I've seen documentaries about average guys working out for 6 months and then competing at the end of it and they often have to stick to strict diets and workout routines to even get close to the right size and shape. I'm not looking to compete but I am looking to gain as much size as I can in, say 6-8 months, while keeping to a modest budget, allowing myself an enjoyable diet, working extended hours and enjoying social events. One of the things I'd look at is the fact that you can't be 4% BF and still go out with friends and have beers etc. It would be about which things need to be comprimised and essentially, is it worth it?

There is a great deal to think about before I would begin this but I wanted to see if people would be interested in watching something like this? I would keep reddit informed of my progress but then at the end of the program, I'd release the video online for people to watch the entire process for themselves.

I'd also be looking for everyone's advice and tips, but mainly, the things they have to work around and don't want to give up. I'd then decide on the things that definitely can't be changed but try to come up with a program I can stick to without depriving myself of any and all fun for the 6-8 month period.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,blue,True,t3_1gys5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1gys5s/help_would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_video_diary/,

&gt; **Intro**


Found this sub over a year ago, followed a lot of advice here and put on a lot of weight. Prior to 13 months ago, I had done no exercise and was very weak! I went from 162 -&gt; 182lb in my first month, then 182 -&gt; [around 188lb in four months.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/zterf/my_progress_this_summer_64_163188_lbs_in_4_months/) I then left for uni and started a strict diet eating the same thing, reaching around 200lb by December, 7 months in. I continued bulking until around mid feb (9 months) where I did not have any scales but I guess I was around 205lb. I decided to cut for the summer, and dropped down to around 195lb, realising I started cutting a bit too early I bulked again for a month and have since cut down to around 191lb. I went on holiday recently, which was why I cut and I was at the point of visible abs without tensing at 190lb. I also made sure I got photos the day before I left for holiday, so a slight tan did not make it harder to judge progress. 

&gt; **Stats**

* I have never tested my 1rm, all of these are 8 rep maxes, except deadlift and squat which is 5.

* Bench - mostly used dumbbells so total weight was - 14kg(30lb) -&gt; 76kg(167lb). 

* Squat - smith machine to start with 20kg(44lb) 8 reps -&gt; 100kg(220lb) squat free weight - strict form.

* Deadlift - I started deadlifting 8 months in at 100kg(154lb) -&gt; 162.5kg(360lb) sumo deadlift. 

* OHP - 14kg(30lb) -&gt; 64kg(141lb) 

* Pullups - assisted (40kg) for 5 reps -&gt; 8 reps with full ROM (pause at bottom). 


&gt; **Initial routine for 8 months**


 The first 8 months I spent doing a full body workout three days a week. This used four main compound exercises, then adding on three accessory exercises which was normally anything I fancied doing. Looking back I should have added in deadlifts at least once a week at this point, and made a routine for my accessory exercises. My first month was also mostly focused on machine work and no leg work - I am very lucky to realise my mistakes only one month in. The first 8 months involved no ab work at all. 

* Squat 3x12

* Bench 3x12

* OHP 3x12

* Assisted Pull-ups 3xfailure

* The accessory movements were a mix of - curls, lat machine, chest press machine, assisted dips, incline bench, tricep extension and a few others that I cannot remember. 

The warmup and warm down was 5 minutes on a rowing machine at a decent pace (1000 metres in 5 minutes). 


&gt; **Routine for the past 5 months** 

* [This is a log of my last 5 months]( http://imgur.com/FLbtsQ1) - purple signals a start of a cut (500 cal deficit), green is the start of a bulk (500 cal increase), yellow is the start of taking creatine - all weights are in KG - if there is anything you don't understand just ask!


Although I added a lot of weight and gained a lot of strength following a 3 day routine, my strength and size gains were slowing. I also enjoyed going to the gym and wanted a routine which allowed me to go more often.  I could probably have followed SS or Stronglifts, I decided to construct my own program because I wanted a routine that I actually enjoyed doing that I would not find boring. The last 5 months haven't been the greatest for my strength goals, but I have definitely made much better progress aesthetically in this time. 

* I have logged every lift during this time, and each day I have written reasons for why I may have lifted poorly or how I could have improved etc. 

* You will notice that I haven't that much strength gains in this period, but I actually went from 205lb down to around 192lb without losing any strength. 

* I also made a huge effort to clean up my form. My squats went as high as 120kg(264lb) but I realised although I wasn't completely quarter squating I was still not below parallel. So I make sure I am deep now, which was a bit annoying to deload but I'm much better for it now.

* My low curl is because I normally do it at the end of a workout, and it causes my wrists some pain, no matter if its straight bar, z bar or dumbbells. 

* My pullups have not increased because I also made sure I was making a full ROM.  

* My routine changed slightly after my rest week, as I had to go to a worse gym which had less equipment and it was generally a worse gym but I have had no choice.  I would have preferred to stuck to my original routine. 

* I also added in a few ab exercises at this point, making sure they were heavy with low reps. 

* I reduced my warm up warm down to 3 minutes row but at a faster speed at 3 mins for 800 metres. 


&gt; **Initial bulk diet**

Like many of the subs here, I thought I was eating a shit load of junk food at around 2-2.5k cals a day, which I guess is enough for the average 5""10 non athletic person, but definitely not enough for me at 6""4. 

* *First month* I didn't really know where to start, so I just started eating a lot of food, eating what I normally ate and adding extra eggs for breakfast and started taking protein shakes. I admit it was fairly dirty and I put on around 20lb in this time period, going from 163lb - 182lb. I didn't get fat enough to be annoyed by it, and I was much happier being at around that weight. I still ate chocolate bars, and started adding in things like bagels which could easily add an extra 1000cals to a day. Looking back I think I must have been at around 3k cals a day. 

* *Second-fourth month* I started eating a bit cleaner around this time, whilst getting into a routine of my diet. Breakfast turned into a bowl of oats which full fat milk, 4 crumpets and 3 eggs with cheese and tomato. Lunch was 3 slices of ham and 4 slices of bread. Dinner was a mix of food, with lots of pasta. I also still had protein shakes and started adding in 4 slices of bread and peanut butter. 

&gt; **Fourth-ninth month** 


I got much stricter now, I was now eating the same thing every single day, I had no chocolate, or anything most would consider 'bad'. My diet was now at around 3800-4000 calories a day. I did gradually increase my calories during this period by increasing portion sizes of my pasta. This would be my day:

* Bowl of oats, and full fat milk / 4 crumpets / 3 eggs cheese and tomato. 

* ON protein shake, with full fat milk and Greek yogurt. 

* 3 slices of ham, cous cous, cheese tomato and cucumber sandwiches for lunch. 

* 4 slices of bread with peanut butter.

* 2 bananas, 2 apples.

* two handfuls of cashews.

* 7 crackers and cottage cheese

* 200g chicken, curry sauce of some kind (around 150 cal in the sauce), carrots onions peppers mushrooms and some other veg. 

* Around 200g dry of pasta - around 600-700 cals of pasta.

&gt; **Bulking from the ninth month onwards** 

At this point I got super strict with my diet, eating a cheat meal about once a month. I swapped out the ham and replaced it with chicken so I was eating 400g (.8lb) of chicken every day and chicken became the only meat I ate. I took out the greek yogurt and reduced my milk intake by 3/4 - mostly to improve acne and dental health (lower sugar) which worked. I was eating exactly the same as above apart from that.

* [Album of my food for the day - only missing a second apple](http://imgur.com/a/HxDb8)

&gt; **My cut during the 11th and 13th month diet**

I took out the peanut butter sandwiches, the cashews, the crumpets and the bread I had during lunch whilst maintaining large evening meals. I replaced the bread at lunch which salad and also took out the cheese. I was eating around 2.8k cals a day and losing weight at around 1-1.5lb a week. 

&gt; **Final comments**

* Start logging your lifts, it really does help to gauge your progress, and see your weak points. 

* I only spent maybe 15 minutes a week focusing on abs, I felt they improved much more with diet. 

* I did drink maybe twice a month, I counted this as my cheat meal, I still ate correctly the next day. Its' also worth noting, I stopped drinking beer and went for vodka or another spirit with a diet mixer. 

* I also made sure I got 8 hours of sleep every single night.

* Only supplements I took was one scoop of ON protein per day. I have recently added creatine in the last month or so and I have noticed a bit of improvement. 

* To those on this sub that I see complaining that you are over six foot and your gains are harder, yes in photos you may not look as good, but in real life when stood side by side with another person you are in a much better position - and guess what,  that's when it matters!

* I only drank water, and maybe 200ml in my protein shakes of full fat milk.

* My posture has also improved greatly, I now stand slightly taller than I used to, and sit more upright.

* The goal is to bulk for two months, then cut for a month for a holiday then bulk again over the winter. 
Hopefully reach 1000 total within a few months then hopefully 500 deadlift within a year. 

* And yes, I know my chest is weak! Show me someone who progressed from a flat chest to a decent chest in a year if you are going to call me out. 

* Although the only cardio I have done during most of this time has been 3 minute speed rows 8 times a week, I went for a run a few weeks back for the first time in about 5 years. Without any cardio training, I managed to run a hill climb and back down (5 miles total) in just over an hour without stopping. I'm hoping to get some more cardio in, so I can eat a bit more as I still get hungry nowadays!

(x-post from Progress pics)",Awesomefaec,154,18,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1k648k/progressjust_finished_my_first_year_of_serious/,"[The picture(s)](http://i.imgur.com/28UDTXA.jpg).

So today is my one year mark of lifting seriously. I've been lifting for a total of probably close to 3.5 years now, but before I never really cared about it. By lifting seriously, here's what I mean:

1. Tracked my calories/macros (IIFYM!)
2. Kept a regular gym schedule as best I could
3. Followed proper programming, not so much proper progression (I jumped weight a lot, instead of following the recommended +5 or +10 increases.)
4. Got into the big three lifts plus one I would personally consider a main lift

The first time I stepped into a gym or even working out in general was in Spring 2010, and that was to prep for the military. I think I was around 125-135lbs during this time. I did no compound lifts during this time, stuck only to a handful of machines, body weight stuff, and thought I could also curl my way to being aesthetic as fuark. In short, I was a fucking idiot, I saw some shitty noob gains, but no real increase in strength. If I recall correctly, around this time I was struggling to machine chest press 80lbs and I had no idea what the fuck a deadlift was.

I also never did legs.

August 2010 I left for the Army, gained roughly 15lbs in BCT which put me at about 145lbs on a good day. I did not know how out of shape I was till BCT. But by the end of it, I had gotten somewhat better. I went back to just doing the Army's PT, body weight stuff, and mostly just push ups and sit ups; you know, real functional strength (Yeah, no).

When I was in AIT, One morning for PT my company did circuit training with kettle bells and other items. I had never used kettle bells before and one of the exercises was the kettle bell deadlift. Me being stupid, picked two 25lbs kettle bells, with no idea what I was doing, proceeded to enter the gates of the fabled ""Snap City"". I heard an audible pop and a sharp pain in my lower back/right hip and dropped to the ground. I played it off as I didn't wanting to appear weak, thinking it was just a small injury due to my back/scoliosis. At the time it felt like, and sometimes still feels like, the right side of my hip is rotated out ahead of my body. I've gotten X-rays since then and all appears normal. However, during this time I swore I would never deadlift again. I was terrified injuring myself again and didn't want to risk anything.

After some recuperation, I started going to the gym with some friends, this was my introduction to compound lifts, or at least the bench press and seated barbell shoulder press (Still hate it). Now that I look back at it, during this time I still had no real idea what I was. I don't recall working legs once, bench every couple of days, and doing P90x's Ab Ripper program. My bench was an embarrassing 115lb max, often setting 95lb for reps. I slowly progressed to 3x5 at 135lbs before graduating from AIT.

At this point I'm in Georgia, good ol' Fort Benning. I meet some cool people, and start hitting the gym again. Started benching, squatting, doing some small programming and making small progress. I was still an idiot though, I was so caught up in looks and appearance (Suffered from Body Dysmorphic Disorder, self diagnosed but either way, it sucked.) I was eating at a caloric deficit, though I didn't know it at the time, I thought I was doing the whole “eat healthy” thing, and in turn would be healthy. I also tried numerous thermogenic fat burners, test boosters, and pre-workouts with little to no success or results other than the placebo effect. I would fluctuate between 140lbs and 155lbs pretty regularly here. I was finally able to bench my body weight at a 160lbs 1RM (One rep max). My numbers at this time were something like:

* 5'8/150lbs (All numbers given in this format are 1RM unless stated otherwise)
* OHP: 0lbs (never tested)
* Bench: 160lbs
* Squat: 285lbs
* Deadlift: 50lbs (unofficially, never tested)

End of 2011 I get separated from a lot of my good friends as I was switched units, this also made me incredibly lazy and stopped going to the gym as I had no partner most of the time. For PT we started doing more crossfit type stuff, which was okay at the time, was a challenge. I was pretty sedentary outside of mandatory PT and stuff till about mid 2012. My workout buddy had deployed, I was engrossed in League of Legends, and would often just order pizza and sit in my room on the weekends playing games with friends over Skype. This slowly led to a downward spiral, I'm sure many of you know I wasn't in too happy of a place during this time, and I'll leave it at that.

July 2012 I came home for a bit, and saw how much some of my friends have changed. Some lost a large amount of weight, some gained a bit of muscle, some did both. But the big thing was, almost everyone grew up. This left a huge impact on me, and I wanted to change and grow up too. I wanted out of my hole and out of the shitty situation I was in. I started reading up on nutrition, programming, looking up videos on form, browsing forums religiously. Fitness and working out became a passion of mine very quickly. That second weekend in August marked my new beginning, the following Monday I started my actual journey of bulking from a meager 145lbs. I followed my own poorly designed strength program that operated off of a 3 day split. A was Chest/Triceps/Shoulders, B was Back/Biceps, C was legs; every week my schedule was ABxBCAx.

I had been lifting serious for about three months now, and been browsing /r/fitness trying to learn as much as possible. One day I came across Craig's Story (Still keep it bookmarked to this day: http://doyouevenlift.tumblr.com/post/31050932469/craigs-story). I was inspired to face my fears and attempt the deadlift again. That day after work I went to the gym and did my routine, after I finished I took a barbell from a bench and proceeded to deadlift 85lbs (38.6 kg); I did it without incident and was excited. I started incorporating deadlifts into my routine, slowly working my way up.

I quickly made good gains now that I was eating right and frequently lifting, shooting up to 170lbs in a matter of months. When I went home for Christmas, people noticed, but I wanted more. It was at this point I realized, I would never be able to give this up, even if I wanted to;

I didn't choose the gym life, the gym life chose me. (Sorry, trying to keep this entertaining).

At this point I was something like:

* 5'8/150lbs
* OHP: 0lbs (never tested)
* Bench: 215lbs
* Squat: 315lbs
* Deadlift: 385lbs

January 2013 I was back in the saddle, I strained my back trying for a deadlift PR, having a flash back to 2011, I went to the doctors immediately. I took it easy for a couple weeks, and also decided to change up my routine at this time. I opted for Jim Wendler's 5/3/1+BB and designed my workout around that, focusing on strength development first, and size as a second (powerbuilding).

On April 8th, I managed to meet my first goal, I entered the 1000lb club (Bench, squat, deadlift combined) after pulling a deadlift PR of 405lbs. During the past couple months I had been on a recomp diet (Leangains), which kept me fluctuating between 170lbs and 180lbs, but never really over that. I added OHP to my routine and had been doing it for a couple months. Soon my shoulders really developed, which were one of my weakest parts. I was sitting at around these numbers:

* 5'8/176lbs
* OHP: 135bs
* Bench: 240lbs
* Squat: 360lbs
* Deadlift: 405lbs

May 21st signaled my return to freedom, or civilian life. I now was able to have near full control over my diet, exercise, and with it being summer, sleep. I had a solid four months to just focus on my fitness, and that's what I did. I decided fuck the recomp; I wanted to bulk. I want to get strong as fuck, and I want to look like I am too – I wanted to be shredded and claim my spot in Brolympus, like Zyzz and the great gods of fitness had already done.

* My numbers at the time were:
* 5'8/175lbs (dehydrated/dried out)
* OHP: 160lbs
* Bench: 260lbs
* Squat: 410lbs
* Deadlift: 475lbs

Since then I've kicked myself into overdrive. I started eating around 4000cal a day, lifting 6x a week, with dedicated core work, and sprints 6x a week as well. I'm in the gym for 2-3 hours a day, often pushing myself till I'm both mentally and physically burnt out, sometimes past that, but isn't that what it's all about?

So now that my first year as a disciple of iron has finished, and my personal “Finals” week has passed, it's time to see where I sit:

* 5'8/192lbs (full of water)
* Bodyfat: ~13%
* OHP: 175lbs
* Bench: 315lbs (I think I can actually push more)
* Squat: 470lbs
* Deadlift: 515lbs
* Total: 1300lbs.

Here are the details, if you want more information, feel free to ask me:

**Diet:** 40/45/15 macro split (protein/carbs/fat), totaling ~4000cal on lifting days and 3200cal on rest days. I aim for 300g protein a day, often taking 2-3 shakes a day.

**Supplements:** Creatine, fish oil, melatonin, BCAA (In my protein), ZMA

**Work out:** 5/3/1+BBB, emphasis on strength with accessory lifts for bodybuilding. Here's the exact thing: http://imgur.com/tW092Qm, sprint program can be found here: http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most.../the_6week_sprinting_solution.

**Rest:** I sleep like 8-14 hours a day, ask my friends and family.

**Motivation:** I lift to challenge myself. One of my core beliefs is that “there is no perfect, only better than you were yesterday”. Weightlifting isn't about throwing around the most weight in the gym, or being the most shredded cunt in the world, it's about beating the only person you need to ever beat; yourself. People talk shit, I talk shit, I talk a whole lot of shit, but when it comes down to it it's just that – Shit. It has no meaning, it has no meaning. You don't owe anyone anything, but you owe it to yourself to be the best you can be.

So you want to put on some muscle? That's good man, that's real good. I wanted to make a post to help inspire those just beginning or continuing their fitness journey. I started mine on August 24, 2011. Setting a goal and joining a competition like Reddit's BTFC is a great method to hold yourself accountable. In my personal journey I have learned the only obstacles we need to overcome are the ones we ourselves set. 

Diet: 
I did GOMAD for 2.5 months to gain half the weight during the second half of the year. In the beginning I relied on BSN true mass to fill in the gaps. Everyday I eat the same things to make it easy. I eat a lot of peanut butter, bagels, cereal and eggs. To maintain I need to eat 4,000 calories. My real secret to gaining is to drink your calories. Be it milk, protein shakes, or some kind of blender concoction with oats that's the way to go. If I drink 2 BSN true mass gainer shakes a day made with milk, frozen banana, and a big scoop of peanut butter that is over 2,000 calories I don't need to worry about. 

Training: I did a split body building routine. I find the best way to train for hypertrophy and mass is the 10-12 rep range with at least 3-4 sets per exercise.  I also add a lot of drop sets into my training as well as super sets between exercises. At the end of a drop set I like to do a burn set with light weight and high reps with no rest.

* Bench: 155lbs-&gt;175lbs
* Dips: w/weight 45lbs-&gt;75lbs


December 2012- got on PHAT, decided that I didn't care as much about only strength training. It took a little bit to get used to PHAT, but I love it so much now, especially while I was on my bulk. Did the typical 5 day split with very slight modifications (didn't do hack squats, squatted 3x5 instead). Never did AB workouts before but would do some hanging leg raises here and there.


Here are my lifts as of today 6/29/13-
Never maxed out my DL so I don't have an idea what that number is. 

* Squat: 350x4
* Bench: 205x3
* Weighted Pull Ups 3x5 w/50lbs
* Weighted Dips: 3x6 w/100lbs 
* Incline DB Bench: 90x5
* DB Bench: 100x3


Diet:
It all started in December 2012- bought a bag of ON Serious Mass. I highly recommend taking this, I took 1 scoop per day in addition to eatings as much as I can. I ended my bulk shortly after finishing 2 bags of Serious MAss. Forget about GOMAD, that shit (literally) sucks and your GF will most likely break up with you. 
MYFITNESSPAL.COM and the App should be everyone's best friend. It is a great tool for tracking calories and only gets easier as you use it. It wasn't until I started tracking calories that I started gaining weight whenever I used to say that I had a hard time gaining weight. I started trying to eat 3400+ calories a day just eating whatever I could and trying to get in 1g protein/lb. Ate every single day, stuffing my face as much as I could and all of my lifts went up and my size as well. I did a dirty bulk and didn't watch what I ate, as long as I hit the calories. Granted I probably had a little more fat on my body but it was worth it for the short period of time. 
At the beginning of April 2013, I started my cut and dropped my calories by 100-200 each week. I am currently at 160lbs eating 2300 calories a day. My macro split is 259g carbs/51g fat/201g protein. 
Hopefully this can shed some light on what has worked for me and others that think they have a difficult time gaining weight. 
Btw- you shouldn't pay more than $50 for a 10lb bag of Serious Mass anywhere. Otherwise you are getting ripped off. The macro's in this are actually pretty good.

Bulking Foods: These foods helped me push my way over 3k cals per day while snacking through the day. I didn't drink milk b/c that shit makes me break out. 

*  PBJ Sandwhiches/PB scoops
*  ALMONDS- so dense
*  Serious Mass


Im planning on ending my cut this fall and starting another bulk, this time a little cleaner and longer. 

tl/dr: Started 145lbs, didn't make and srs gains until I bulked with My Fitness Pal, track macros/calories

My PHAT workout: http://directlyfitness.com/store/p-h-a-t-training-layne-nortons-workout-system/ 
Almost 100% the same during my ""bulk"" but without the hack squats. Right now I am focusing more on strength on my cut so I am only doing 5-7 reps on all of those workouts.

I realize a picture comparison would probably be helpful, so here it is! I think I am going to keep gaining, especially since 115 now seems like nothing having gained some muscle! I feel like I've grown from a little girl into an adult.

""How do I go?"",
""What should I do ?"",
""What happens if people laugh at me?""
""What happens if they see me ?"",
""what happens if I fail?"" .
I had to go alone as I had almost little to none friends near my area that I can count on . It seems to be a silly fear and the thought having gone through 6 months with this fear is really silly .However ,it was really a big wall in front of me psychologically .

How I did it ? 
I sought help .In reddit and outside .It has mostly got to do with the way I thought about this problem .A person who was qualified in helping people told me to imagine what it is like if I had no fear of going to the gym ,imagine if I am very relax and have no problem of going to the gym .He then asked me to imagine step by step how I go from my home ,walk to the alley ,walk to the counter,walk inside of the gym,registering and going to the gym bench ,all these while imagining that I have no problem whatsoever and was relaxed.You should try it .
Fellow redditors helped eased it in by claiming nobody actually cares when you are in the gym and true enough when I entered the gym and started training , people really didn't care what I was doing and focused on what they were doing .There was some 2-3 people out from the whole 30-40 people who was talking about me ,but there was no insult whatsoever,since I was new there,they want to know who I am .Also,people inside were really kind ,the big guys who may have scared you in your thoughts were kind .Some redditors even encouraged going alone as you can manage your own schedule and you can have all the time to yourself in the gym .

This is my experience  .I had problems dealing with this fear and I sincerely hope with the bottom of my heart that I can help some people as others have helped me .You can do it !

I've always been pretty skinny due to the fact that I just don't eat a lot. Before gaining, I found out I had celiac disease after being hospitalized a few times for stomach issues. I had tried to gain a few times before but always got stuck around 160lbs because, well, I didn't eat a lot because I would get sick from gluten. 

Since cutting gluten out of my diet I can eat and eat and still not get full. It's pretty nice compared to eating a little bit and feeling bloated and nauseous. 

All my gains are gluten free and very light dairy. I eat a lot of nuts, granola, fish/chicken/steak and TONS of sweet potatoes and quinoa. I use a dairy and gluten free protein powder as well.

Pics: http://imgur.com/a/3Xqcd#0

This is the second time I've posted my progress here. The last time was about 8 months ago. The weight gain has slowed considerably since then, and that is to be expected with my noobie gains out of the way. I've also had some setbacks along the way (illness, injuries, and Tough Mudder prep were the biggest hinderances in consistent gaining). If you're interested, my first post is here http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/121uxe/progress_8_months_151lb_173_lb_62_also_have_a/

Lift Progression (all 3x5 numbers):

1.5 years ago --&gt; 8 months ago --&gt; now

Squat 75 --&gt; 185 --&gt; 220 (265 max) (insanely bad progress with my squat. I've been trying to fix it but will probably soon seek some form checks. To make the long story short, I've tried front squats, box squats, leg press, assistance movements, and varied rep ranges, but nothing has helped me get past 2 plates consistently.)

DL: Never done (prob like ~80ish) --&gt; 195 --&gt; 315 (365 max)

Bench: 105 --&gt; 145 --&gt; 190 (205 max)

OHP: 45 --&gt; 90 --&gt; 110

Diet: nothing out of the ordinary here. ~150g protein and ~2700-3000 calories per day. Recently (2-3 months) I've taken a huge liking to Intermittent Fasting. The idea of it is you eat all your food in a 6-8 hour window in order to keep your inslulin from spiking too much throughout the course of the day. The reason I like it is because I get very tired after I eat, especially breakfast, so I actually usually eat my first big meal around 1pm. I don't follow IF to a T however, and I'll sometimes eat breakfast, or extend my food intake window from 8 hours to 10. If you wish to find out more for yourself, /r/leangains

Workouts: I started off just like most of us here, with Starting Strength. I ran the program with very good progression for approximately 9 months, but as you can see from my first picture there wasn't much volume added to my arms which is something I wanted to address. Since then I've stuck to a fairly generic 4 day split (Chest/tris, back/bis, legs, shoulders/core) and it's been working well for me. The only ""out of the ordinary"" part of my workout is that I've recently started to add Cleans which is something not a lot of people do. I love it because it's such a fun lift and you feel manly as fuck doing it. If your gym allows Oly lifts try it out - you won't be disappointed.

For all of you that are on SS, let me try and give you one tip. Do not make the mistake I did and completely neglect doing ab workouts. I read all the time that heavy squats and deadlifts are more than enough core work, but for me it wasn't. The first time I started stalling on squats was because my core wasn't strong enough and couldn't keep me tight. I ended up leaning too far forwards and shooting my hips out of the hole, followed by a good morning at the top. With better core strength I could maintain much better form and continue progressing at a faster rate. I've started throwing in core work 1-2 times per week and I feel like it's helped all my lifts. It doesn't even take a long time - all I do is ab rollouts, planks, and hanging leg raises. I've also dropped a little bit of fat (as you can see from one of the pictures) while training for Tough Mudder and my Adonis Belt started juuuuuust barely peeking out. I doubt it would've made as big a difference had I not started doing abs.

Hopefully this serves as some inspiration to beginners that if I could gain weight, you definitely can too. I used to be very skinny, 0 appetite (could go on 1 meal a day no problem) but by forcing myself to eat more and reading up online I think I've made good changes to my body.

http://imgur.com/a/EEl38

I'm what you would call a ""hardgainer"", been skinny my whole life until now. Here are some things that worked for me over the years. It may not be the best and it may not work for everyone, but it worked for me: 

- Eat, eat as much as you can. I never liked eating, its like doing homework. And forget about cooking, if it didn't take 2.5-3min on high then forget about it. That will all have to change if you want to gain weight. I'm not one to count calories, so if you are indeed a hard gainer, eat everything you can find and worry about the healthy stuff later. Now that I have gained a lot of weight, I focus more on eating healthy, but when I was skinny...whatever i could find....I ate.

- Protein, take as much protein as you can. I never counted how many grams of protein per lb of body weight i was taking in. Chances are it is never enough so i just drank as much protein as i could fit in a day. While I was in my heavy gaining stage I drank a lot of weight gainer. In the morning, before a workout, after a workout, in the evening, and drink casein protein right before going to bed. It's a slower releasing protein and will hold you over for the night. (This can get expensive so be prepared to spend quite a bit on food/supplements). If your job requires a bit of cardio (mine did) I would also eat a Builder Bar (20g of protein each) every couple hours. Those are good if you don't have time to eat a meal as well. Also, be sure to drink your post-workout protein/weight gainer within 30min after you're done working out. Its when the body needs it, give it to your body.

- Biggest rule of all for hard gainers - No Cardio. I hardly did any cardio while i was trying to gain weight. If you are a hard gainer, your body will autoburn everything for you, no need to help it out. Also try to keep your heart rate down in the gym while you lift. Take longer rest periods if you need to. It may sound crazy, but if you really can't gain weight, its what you gotta do. If you absolutely positively have to do cardio, then do HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). Basically doing short bursts of hard cardio, then longer periods of heart rate reducing cardio over and over. It's the best way to do it while trying to gain. I do jump rope HIIT exercises. Fact of the matter, you're going to gain fat, there's no way around it. If you're super skinny and trying to get big, there's gotta be some fat gain. Good thing is, your body's natural way of life will keep the fat down. I gained 40lbs of muscle, only do a little bit of cardio, and you can see my six pack.

- I start off my mornings everyday with a protein shake and some fruit., 30min to an hour later I'll have 3-4 scrambled eggs with spinach and more fruit. I'll usually have chicken breasts and vegetables (since they're my favorite) for lunch, and whatever i feel like for dinner. I'll usually lean towards more healthy things though. Fruits, vegetables, grilled things. I have also cut out soda completely and I try to keep my sugar intake down. The good thing about us hard gainers is we can have more cheat days than other people (I love cake). I'll still throw in my protein shakes throughout the day. Not weight gainers, just whey protein. The whey protein i use now is BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder. I do still use the BSN weight gainer as an after workout drink though.

- Other Supplements - Some people have different opinions, but I found creatine to be a big help when trying to gain weight. I still take a pre-workout powder that has creatine and a bunch of other things (BCAA's, Glutamine, etc) in there to aid in the gaining process. I took Jack3d for a period of time....but it gave me the jitters, so I quit....comin up on 6 months clean. I now take Muscle Pharm Assault as a pre-workout drink 30min before i work out. I like it and the mango orange is the best i've tasted and it doesn't make me crazy.

- As far as a workout program is concerned, just get to the gym. The biggest key is consistency. It took me 2 years to put on all that weight. You may not see very noticeable results at first, it may take up to 6 months to really see it, but you have to keep going. Once you do start to see results, you'll be hooked. Check out this website for a training program: http://www.simplyshredded.com/category/training/workout-programs

Just pick one and go with it, you can modify it to suit your needs/ability, but just keep getting in the gym. I workout 5-6 days a week now and I love it. Whatever you do, don't stop, even if you feel like you're not getting anywhere. Eat and get in the gym. Also after a couple months of doing the same workout program, switch it up. Pick something different that does different workouts on different days. You'll confuse your muscles and keep them growing.

And don't skip leg day....

I have been lurking on this subreddit for a while and decided that I should contribute something to the community. 

[Before and After](http://imgur.com/a/UNkAN) I tried to put a couple pictures that have what I would consider good lighting and some with just normal lighting. 


**Back story:**

 I ran cross country for the first three years of high school. Obviously, I was really skinny. I think at the end of my junior year of running I was a little under 140 pounds at 6 foot. Every once in a while we would go to our school's weight room and lift. I remember that myself and a couple friends tried to max out on the bench press and none of us could get 100 lbs. After the cross country season was over, a couple friends that played football convinced me to start lifting. So I lifted on and off for a few months. I would basically just go into the gym and bench press/ do chest flyes. I think that I could bench press 135 by the time track started to roll around. I stopped lifting again because of track and didn't have a gym membership that summer(2012). Once school started, I decided that I was done with cross-country and I wanted to start lifting seriously.  So when I say 1 year in the title I mean that it has been 1 year of lifting seriously. If you count going to my school's gym and messing around on the bench, then it is closer to 1 year and 4 months. 

**Lifting Routine:**

I started with this [workout](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/criticalbench23.htm). I still pretty much only cared about bringing up my bench, and I think I even found that workout googling ways to bring it up. At this point, I did not even keep track of my diet. By January I was looking for a new workout, and I started to make sure that I was getting enough calories everyday. A friend who had recently went through the type of transformation that I was looking to make recommended PHAT. Here's the [article] (http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) for anyone that hasn't seen it yet. So I started to do PHAT and that mixed with good nutrition allowed me to gain a lot of muscle. I made a couple switches to the workout. I swapped upright rows for dumbbell shrugs and rack chins for weighted pull ups on back/shoulders day. I also heavy deadlift and heavy squat once a week (one on each of the leg days and I take out the 6 sets of 3). At the beginning of the summer I wanted to switch it up so I tried [GVT] (http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/luis13.htm). Personally I didn't really like it because I thought that it was boring and the volume was awful. I only made it through 5 cycles of it and then I went back to PHAT.  

Side note: I see a lot of questions on here about people wondering whether or not they should do PHAT, so I just wanted to say that it is by far my favorite workout program and I have made gains pretty consistently for about 6 months on it.  


Lifting numbers:

Bench: 1 x 100 to 2 x 200 (this is with dumbells, so 100 pounds in each hand)

Squat: 1 x 100 to 3 x 265

Deadlift: Idk to 1 x 295

I know that my deadlift is really weak and that's because I literally didn't start consistently deadlifting until this summer. 

**Diet:**

My diet right now is not even close to as structured as it was during the school year, and I mostly just make sure that I hit the macros that I want to hit (100f/ 450c/220p), which is approximately 3500 calories a day. When I was in high school, I would aim for approximately 3200 calories a day (70f/450c/200p). I try to eat fairly ""clean"" and the majority of my calories come from brown rice, milk, chicken, etc. If you guys want to know exactly what I eat,  I will post it, but there is a considerable amount of variation from day to day.

I don't think that my fat gains have been too bad (I estimate that I am probably somewhere around 13-15% body fat), so I am going to continue to bulk when I go to college. I will probably drop my calories back down to 3200, and cut after the school year is over. 

**Supplements:**

I take Muscletech Whey Protein. It is probably not the best quality protein out there but it is by far the cheapest. Also, it has creatine in it, so you save a few more bucks there.

Pre workout I take Beta- Alanine, a 200 mg caffeine pill, and I recently started taking 50mg of DMAA

Also, for a few months I took an Orange Triad multivitamin everyday.


**Music:**

I saw someone post the music they like to listen to in a progress post the other day, and I will do the same because I really hope that this becomes a part of posting progress here. Some of my favorites are:

[Til I Collapse Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjT5q9OZqyY) Everyone has heard the original, but 2pac and 50 cent also dropped verses on this and it is amazing (especially 50 cent's part)

This wasn't really a black/white transformation for me, like a new year's resolution or something. Rather, I just started making fitness part of my lifestyle. That started with doing bench press in my basement every couple days, then progressed to reading some fitness books and eventually joining a crossfit gym (where the ""after"" picture was taken). Generally, I do some sort of workout most days. Sometimes it's running or hill workouts, often it's a crossfit style interval type workout with pushups, pullups, squats, thrusters, dips, shoulder presses, etc. I don't really drink the crossfit koolaid like many crossfitters do, but it's certainly a great, structured way to learn a lot about working out.

I actually didn't drastically change my diet. My challenge/goal is simply to eat plenty of good food. We all know what's good for you and what's not. (Junk food sucks, candy, pop, etc suck. Home made veggies and protein is good) I just try to eat a lot of good stuff, but don't sweat it too much. I have the body type where when I get out of shape I just get skinny and wimpy instead of putting on weight.

There are some other pics in [an album](http://imgur.com/a/kkDlV#4) that I took to get a critique from /r/bodybuilding, feel free to poke around.

I count this transformation as one of the 3 most important accomplishments of my life so far.  For all of you who are working at the same thing, YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING, AND IT IS WORTH THE PAIN AND THE SWEAT.

I unfortunately don't have any pics of my starting point at 165 pounds.  If I had known what I was doing at the beginning, and had stayed dedicated from day 1, this would never have taken 10 years... maybe more like 3.

I started working out when I was 16 but really had no idea what I was doing- I just went to the gym once every couple of weeks with a buddy of mine and goofed around.  Mostly I was into things like mountain biking and hiking where light weight was an advantage so it never really bothered me to be so skinny.

When I was 18, I started taking it a little more seriously and put on another 20 pounds but still had no structure to my workouts and had no idea about the importance of diet.  This is when I made it up to 185 pounds.  Over the next couple of years, I got up to about 205 but ended up cutting back down to 185 when I got really into rock climbing.  The 185# pic above is me when I was 21 years old.

Over the next 5 years, my pattern was generally to work out for a few months and make some gains which would then taper off, and I'd hit a plateau and quit again out of frustration.  I made it as high as 235, but then I got into BJJ and had to cut back down to 215 to make weight.  That's where I was at in the 2006 pic above.

One day in 2008 I was talking to a friend of mine about my frustrations, and how I had come to the conclusion that I could never have the body I wanted without steroids if I hadn't achieved it in 6 years of trying.  He asked a simple question: ""Are you sure you're eating enough?""

Me: ""Does that actually matter?""

I spent the next couple of months voraciously reading everything related to weight gain and hypertrophy that I could get my hands on.  I started studying anatomy and physiology on my own time so that I could understand journal articles.  I put a game plan together, upped my caloric intake from ~1800 calories per day to ~6500, and switched my workouts to heavy compound lifts.  I went from 215 to 275 over the course of 7 months.  This was without any chemical assistance of any kind.  For a while I was literally putting on a pound a day.  It was like my body had just been waiting for me to figure this out.  This was an extremely dirty bulk- I ate anything I wanted, with butter on it, and stayed so full that I literally had to have my wife tie my shoes.

This was one of the most exhilarating times of my entire life.

One day, at 275 pounds, I was sitting down and noticed that I was muffin topping pretty hard over my pants.  I was shocked.  I had never even considered the fact that I could get chubby, but there I was.

I cut calories and lost 10 pounds, and that's where the 2008 pic up there came from.  That was 8 months after I started bulking.

My entire life changed over those 8 months.  I became a different person.  People reacted entirely differently to me.  The weight was distributed so much differently on my body that I could feel a difference in the way I walked.  For the first time, women started treating me like a sex object.  People started assuming I was stupid, or an asshole, or acting scared of me when they first met me.  I thought it was hilarious.

After that big bulk though, I had pretty much completely lost my flexibility and athleticism.  I wasn't stretching or doing any cardio of any kind, and I ended up stiff and out of shape.  I switched it up for a while and got those things back, and then shifted my focus more into combat sports instead of lifting.  I spent maybe a few months a year back in the gym but never stayed focused long enough to make any major changes.  My weight bobbed around between 245 and 285 during this time.

I've spent the last 2 years doing competitive judo, and in the last few months I feel like I've finally figured out my diet and have started lifting again.  I'm starting to put some serious thought into training for a bodybuilding competition and seeing how it goes.  I don't take any steroids or anything more drastic than creatine.

It's basically a major mission in my life now to help the people around me make these kinds of changes in their own lives.  I spent SO FUCKING LONG thinking I was trapped in the body I had, and that it would never be any different.  I used to watch [Mirko Cro-Cop](http://fiveouncesofpain.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Cro-Cop.jpg) fight and want so badly to look exactly like him.  I had resigned myself to the fact that it would never happen.

So that's my story.  Along the way I've learned a LOT about diet, lifting, sports injuries, overtraining, cardio, cooking, etc. - ask me anything!

I see a lot of people struggling to eat to their 500 calorie surplus, the fact of the matter is, is that your metabolism and stomach is really shrunk right now. I see a lot of people going from 1,500 calories to 3000 in one day and honestly that just won't happen.. In my inpatient treatment I was eating 6,000 calories, up from 800. How? The amazing doctors in the treatment center boosted my cals up 250-300 every other day.. This expanded my stomach and my appetite. Now downing 3,000 calories is very easy.

The fact of the matter is, is that our stomachs aren't used to expanding in one day, its through a few weeks of just configuring with it and eating a bit more every single day. Don't go from 1,500 to 3,000+ or you will just feel sick and won't be able to move. Just boost gradually and eventually you'll get there. I discussed something with a member today about how he ate fruits, which are extremely filling. Honestly I include greens and fruits into my diet, but just eating those won't get the job done. I include poptarts whenever I need the carbs/calories, it's very easy and non filling. That is why I like IIFYM diet.

I just realized that I hit my 1 year mark in my swole searching. I'm not exactly where I wanted to be (I didn't realize it was 1 year until I took a look at the date of my pictures) as I was hoping to finish my cut by now, but I took an oath I would post my transformation as soon as I hit 1 year, so here I am!

Hoping to cut down about 5-10 more lbs.


To be perfectly honest, while bulking and cutting, I didn’t really keep track of my diet, I guess that’s just a benefit of being young. I just tried to get around 250-300 grams of protein a day and just ate whenever I felt I had an empty stomach. It was definitely a dirty bulk though. I apologize that I can’t be more specific.

When I was 16 I weighed 130 and was the same height I am now. When I graduated high school I decided I was fed up with people asking me if I ever ate so I worked my ass off to gain as much weight as possible, in eight months I went from 145 to 170 but broke my collarbone in a car accident and had surgery, which put me out of the gym for about 5 months and with my metabolism that was enough time to drop down to 145 again. Got dumped and decided it was time for a change now that I was a single man again so I worked my ass off once again to get to the size I am now! Skinny people out there: IT CAN BE DONE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY SKINNY!

Diet: I was eating about five meals a day with a daily total of about 3,500-4,000 calories, consisting mainly of chicken for dinner, a lot of hot dogs (not healthy I know), and snacking on PB&amp;J's for dayssss and almonds, for breakfast having egg sandwiches like every single day, and then weight gainer protein shakes directly after a workout and directly before bed



Routine: I use a micro-cycle program, I learned a while back that in order to not plateau in growth you have to constantly keep your body guessing so now I do a different workout count every single week and alternate over four weeks. 


-First week: do 12-15 reps on every single set of everything you do 


-Second week: do 9-11 reps on every single set of everything
 

-Third week: do 5-9 reps on every single set 


-Fourth week: do VERY high weight (around 80-85% max) @ 3-5 reps of everything


Monday: chest and tri 


Tuesday: Back and Bi 


Wednesday: Shoulders 


Thursday: legs 

Friday: accessory arm workouts(whatever part of me feels like it needs more work that week) and cardio

The progress in the picture is about 4-5 months give or take. My goal is probably 160 lbs, with around 12-13% BF by July next year. I know I have a LONG way to go, my chest and shoulders are really lacking. Also, I have no idea what my BF is now, so if somebody could give me a estimate that would help a lot.

I'm ancient - 27 years old and I'm still in my ""before"" pics. 6'0"" 155lbs. Guess how depressed I am about it? Not one fucking bit.

I used to get down on myself for not going to the gym and eating the necessary calories to gain weight. The only thing worse than being skinny is knowing your lazy ass is to blame. 

Recently I realized my own thoughts were sabotaging me. Every time I would get pumped to gain weight, I'd get really into it for a few weeks and then it would peter off. The typical reasons anyone stops were no stranger to me. ""I'm not noticing any change"", ""When will I be huuuge!"", etc. Does this happen to you?

You see, I was always craving the end goal and when I didn't see it, I'd give up. A year or two would go by and I'd look in the mirror after going to the beach where, inevitably, I was the scrawniest of the bunch and I'd say ""I'm going to try again. I'm going to get huuuuuge!"" Rinse. Repeat. For 10 years.

Then as Jan 1 2013 rolled around, I thought about it yet again. But this time I thought about it a little differently. Instead of wondering how fast I can pack on pounds to finally be happy, I thought, ""What if I had just worked out twice a week, every week, since I was 17? Where would I be now?"" 

That changed everything. My New Years resolution was  set. I committed to working out at least twice a week for the rest of my life. By the time I die I will have gone to the gym every single week. 

This creates an amazing freedom in your life, though it may not seem that way by committing yourself to something forever. It gives you the freedom to get things wrong! Analysis paralysis kept me out of the gym and eating right because ""What if my routine isn't perfect? What if I don't get my macros right?"" - all those worries disappear when you give yourself an entire lifetime. You'll read, you'll learn, and you'll adjust. 

Now I take pride in the ritualistic packing of my duffel bag the night before a gym day. I smile at the grocery store when I'm picking out sweet potatoes and grabbing a box of frozen chicken. And I can't tell you, though many of you already know, how amazing it feels to see yourself go from doing 2 pullups to more than 10.

When you enjoy the process, you won't want to quit. You won't get discouraged if you don't see results right away because the results are a side effect of doing something that makes you feel great. 

This is by no means an excuse to settle. Twice a week is not ideal, but it's a start. And moving forward beats standing still every time.

Target weight: 210lbs at around 10% body-fat.

Height: 6'1""

For most of my 'youth' I was very insecure about how skinny I was, always embarrassed to have pictures taken or to take my shirt off. I'd occasionally eat more and go to the gym sporadically but would never gain any weight. As a result I labeled myself as a 'hard-gainer' and told myself that it wasn't my fault that I couldn't gain weight.

Soon after I turned 22, I started hanging out with a friend from high school who, when I had met him, was as skinny as I was but was now well on his way to being 'built'. With his help, and a LOT of research into both nutrition and weight lifting, I began my journey into improving myself. Weight lifting and nutrition are now my main hobbies, and I'm becoming more passionate about it as time goes on.

When I started I was about 145lbs, I'd only consistently eat one large meal a day and then just snack during the rest of the day. I was active, but doing martial arts, playing volleyball and doing long distance running (10km was my preferred distance), I would only occasionally lift weights. I stopped running altogether when I started trying to gain weight seriously, I started eating 3+ meals a day plus 3 protein shakes a day (morning, pre, and post workout) and 1 very large serving of cottage cheese every night before bed (yogurt or maple syrup often mixed in for flavour). 

Initially my gym routine was a bit all over the place, I was really just going 3-4 times a week and doing whatever exercises I thought were the most fun with one simple rule: 3 sets and if I couldn't do 4 reps with proper technique at a weight... it was too heavy, if I could do more than 6 reps... it was too light. I believe this is known as Max OT (Overload Training).

After 6-8 months of the Max OT style training I met a power-lifter at my gym and started doing Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength. I wish I had started with SS because I got some pretty amazing results, within 6 months of doing starting strength I had joined the '1000lbs club' with a 245 bench, a 340 squat and 425 deadlift. At my peak of strength (a few months ago now) I weighed 205lbs and was eating close to 5k calories a day, though was carrying a bit of extra fat around with me, so I decided to cut a bit of weight for the summer. 

I found cutting to be extremely easy, I followed the Intermittent fasting diet, took some extra amino acids to try and avoid muscle catabolism, and stuck to a low-crab, mostly paleo style diet. I now weight just over 185lbs and plan on starting my 'bulk' again soon. Hopefully hitting around 220lbs this winter before cutting again next summer. My ultimate goal is to reach about 210lbs at 10% bodyfat... but to never stop getting stronger after that.

General tips for going to the gym: (a lot of these you may have heard before, but I'm saying them because they're true)

- Leave your ego at the door: in the beginning you may feel self-conscious about being skinny/weak... but you're at the gym to get stronger. I respect anyone who is making the effort to go the gym and better themselves.
- High weight, low rep: Like many, I really do recommend starting strength to anyone who's just starting to lift. You can worry about bodybuilding once you've got a solid strength base.
- Lift heavy, but not too heavy: Don't sacrifice technique, ever. You have to push yourself, but if you push yourself with improper technique it can be downright dangerous... injuries can sideline you for months (or permanently).
- Get a gym buddy: Good for spots/safety, but also makes the gym a hell of a lot more fun. You're more likely to keep going to the gym if you're having fun!
- Drink lots of milk!

[THIS](http://imgur.com/a/NyTvf) is what I currently look like.

I've been keeping progress pictures [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/QDbwATL.jpg)


**Routines and diet**

* Routines

    Started off by doing Starting Strength to build a base upon which to bulk.  

    My lifts increased dramatically during this time:

Deadlift 60kg/132lbs - 110kg/242lbs  
Bench Press 45kg/99lbs - 65kg/143lbs  
Squat 55kg/121lbs - 95kg/209lbs  

I've since moved on to [THIS](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beginner-to-advanced-bodybuilder-in-12-weeks.html) routine, am currently on week 4 and am noticing new and defined gains. Haven't taken a picture for the running progress picture yet since starting this routine.

* Diet 

    Consume roughly 3000-3500 calories per day. Still finding it difficult if I'm having a busy day as I try not to get the calories from majorly unhealthy sources and this can mean that meals are bigger and take more preparation due to this fact.  
Its not a dirty bulk, my aim is not just purely weight gain, I want to stay at a lower than 10% body fat.

A typical days food:  
**Breakfast -** Three or four large eggs scrambled on four slices of wholemeal bread. Might put cheese on it. Pint of orange juice and an apple.  
**Lunch -** Peanut butter sandwiches with four slices of wholemeal bread. Pint of whole fat milk.  
**Dinner -** Two or three large chicken breasts, olive oil and herbs/spices, pasta or rice, vegetables. Pint of Whole milk.  
**Snacks -** Milkshakes with milk, bananas, oats, peanut butter and ice cream on workout days. Most of the time snacks will be fruit, nuts or just more milk.   
Also pleanty of water, about 4 - 5 pints alongside the other drinks

    And a final note - 
    Even at my current weight, it has been a gain of about 22% body weight!

This place is supposed to be a forum for talking about gaining lean weight primarily made up of muscle.This is a great premise for a subreddit except I constantly see outrageous gain claims that are clearly either inflated numbers or numbers heavily relying on water weight, huge amounts of fat, and/or growth in height. These posts are often highly up-voted and do not receive proper criticisms for their often impossible claims. Look at the seventh highest voted for this week. The guy claims to have put on 28 pounds in 4 months. TWENTY-EIGHT pounds in 4 months, and yet from the pictures it looks like his body fat% has not  gone up  much if any at all. The worse thing about this is that he guy received basically no criticism but instead praise for these literally impossible gains. I don't mean to come down on or offend anybody but this is a place to talk about weight gain and I think we've lost our whey (huehue) a little bit. Lets get away from the fairy tale gains and get back to business. Here is some literature if you think i'm talking out of my ass.

I've always been very lean and scrawny. Got tired of it and started to do something about it. I think my biggest problem was not eating ENOUGH! And also the biggest reason I gained around 10 pounds in a month. My diet consisted with eating more. But more of the RIGHT foods, like apples, bananas, chicken, tuna, bacon, steak. But getting the intake of calories that I needed per day. To get that edge I consumed a protein shake in the morning and right before I went to bed. I usually work out at night.

My starting weight was 139 and I just weighed in at 150 yesterday. I stated before that I did not use a gym to work out. The following link describes my workout that I did at home. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n3mbzcRHj8 .... I do have a bench but I have JUST started using it. I recommend HIGHLY doing pull-ups. They are fantastic.

Updated: Average Day Meals

Okay... Just got back from work. I got off at 10 pm today so it's a little late and I wasn't expecting this to get up-voted as much as it did. But first you MUST understand that I was barely eating much at all before I began my journey to gain more weight and muscle mass. I was eating maybe only 2 descent sized meals a day. So... that out of the way I will give you a round about what I eat a day.

In the morning I try to eat a good breakfast... Cereal, 2 hard boiled eggs, and a protein shake between 12 and 16 ounces WHOLE MILK. This is before 9 am in the morning.

My next meal is about 3 to 4 hours later. We'll call it brunch. I'll regularly eat a sandwich consisting of different meats maybe chicken some pork provolone cheese. It's pretty packed. The bread is potato bread. I also eat a banana and an apple with some cashew nuts or pistachios.

Another 3-4 hours later I usually go to subway which is right next to the place I work and order a cheese steak packed with bacon, tuna, provolone cheese, ketchup, and Parmesan cheese. Sometimes I get 2 chocolate chip cookies because they are pretty good. I'll either get a 6 inch or a foot-long. I'm usually drinking water or juice for my last 2 meals.

Another 3-4 hours later I'll have something random for dinner. Might be some pasta dish or flounder or maybe 2 hamburgers.... Random dinners. Sorry I can't be more specific.

I mentioned in my main post that I usually work out at night. So at least 15 mins after I workout I'll drink another 12-16 ounce protein shake combined with a good ole' peanut butter sandwich that's on potato bread. I usually get the Reese's peanut butter.

Any more specifics that I might of left out.... just ask.

One thing I want to say upfront is that there is no PERFECT diet, no PERFECT workout regimen. You have to find what works for you, one thing that works for one person may not work for another.

**Food prep**: Ok go check your cabinets if you do not have these you are missing out. Get a George Foreman fucking **ASAP** these things can let you cook massive amounts of your protein sources in fucking minutes so you can refrigerate that shit and enjoy later. Get a fucking Rice cooker (preferably a large one that can handle 10-12 cups of rice) they go for like $20-$30 at costco or sams club. You can cook massive amounts of rice for the entire week and just microwave it for a one minute and baby you got rice cookin. The last thing I recommend is a decent blender, you can make some bitching gainer shakes in seconds with it. My personal favorite is one cup of oats, 8oz of milk (I prefer skim but get whole milk for gaining), one scoop of your fave protein, 2 tbsp of peanut butter, and a banana. Fucking delicious.

**Food**: Wanna get big on the cheap? Get a membership to costco or sams club. This will save you a SHITTON of money. Buy in bulk to -put on bulk. If you cannot get a membership to one of these you can still stay cheap and get huge. **#1** Buy the shit out of eggs. Buy 5-6 dozen at one time they go for $1-$2 (costco $3.39 for 36 eggs). **#2** Buy oats. No that quaker apple and cinnamon shit, regular old school oats, you can plenty of this for on the cheap (costco 10 lbs, fucking pounds, for $8. Havent gotten it from walmart in awhile so i forget how much it is there) so you can add a packet of splenda or some honey in the morning. **#3** Tuna. Nuff said. **#4** Get the little bags of brown rice at walmart for like $1.33 throw that shit in your rice cooker and you got yourself an awesome carb source. **#5** You need frozen chicken breast you can get 10lbs of this at costco for $20. it will easily last you two weeks. **#6** Get whole wheat bread none of that enriched shit that is simple carbs and that is no bueno you want stone ground or whole whole grain look at the ingredients on the back to make sure you know what you are getting. **And #7** Organic peanut butter. Calorie dense and great source of protein and good fats. After eating this stuff for a bit you wont want to go back to Jiffy or Peter Pan bullshit.

**Supplements**: First and foremost, get a multivitamin you will see a lot improvements by taking one each morning. I see people buying this all the time **DO NOT BUY CASEIN PROTEIN** all it is is dehydrated milk and you pay an insane markup on it and is (one of) the biggest scams in the supp. business. Don't waste your money.  Get Creatine Monohydrate, not the muscletech creatine bull. With monohydrate you get 100% creatine and it is $15-$20, pound this with a glass of your favorite juice and you will start making some serious fucking headway. When buying protein make sure that you get a Low temperature processed protein so that way the protein you are taking in is not denatured and you get most if not all of the protein that is stated on the nutrition facts. 

**Eating schedule**: Try and eat 5-6 times a day make each meal 2-3 hours apart. This will keep your metabolism fired the fuck up and burn up all sorts of shit you put in your stomach so that it doesn't end up as fat but used as fuel for your body. Now, for gaining, **eat till you are full!!!!!**. In the morning I would seriously recommend eating until you want to vomit, it is the worst feeling, I do it about every morning and you just gotta get through it. It fucking sucks but once you start putting on some size you wont regret it. **YOU CAN** eat carbs before you go to bed (I would not recommend this if you are cutting bodyfat and even then its still ok) eat a peanut butter sandwich and milk before you go to bed. **1 gallon of water per day** no excuses drink it. Now if you want nothing else but to put on size, drink a lot of water before you go to bed so that you get up in the middle of the night and pound a protein shake before you go back to sleep to keep you body burning through food.

**Lifting**: To get bigger this is what I recommend 12-16 sets for large body parts (chest, back, legs) 10-12 for smaller body parts (shoulders, bi's and tri's) shoot for 8-12 reps for size. (4-6 reps are usually for strength and 15+ is for endurance). Incorporate these in to your workout. Squats ( a fucking must), dips for chest and tris, and pull ups (get them lats brah) These are incredible mass builders. Keep your workouts to 60-90 minutes and keep the workouts INTENSE (less than 1 minute between sets and 1-2 minutes between exercises). If you don't feel like you need to vomit, you're doing it wrong.

That is about it for right now. I'm open for questions and possibly some requests if you want some personal help. GET HUGE R/GAINIT! DO IT FOR YOURSELVES!

Quit working out as hard as I should have been and my diet was completely awful. Just before I turned 20, I lost my mom suddenly and really started doing a lot of soul searching. I dumped my terrible ex-girlfriend, met an amazing new girl, and started to get serious about my fitness. Now, just over a year after I started busting my ass, I can see real results. I somehow managed to put on 40 lbs despite playing college rugby (insane cardio) and putting about 50 miles/week on my bike.

 I did plenty of lurking on /r/gainit and /r/fitness (and /r/weightroom for those of you who haven't checked it out) and got a ton of great help just by reading everyone else's posts. I gained 25 lbs during the first summer I was busting it and then another 20 over two semesters of rugby. It's been an awesome journey and I'm just getting started. It's great to know that I can actually gain the way I want despite years of not being able to through football workouts in high school.

So basically I just want to say thanks to all of y'all for providing advice, motivation, and inspiration. I doubt I would have been able to do it without this community. I will edit in my diet and workout stuff if anyone is interested. 

P.S. sorry for shitty picture quality on the befores. My better half decided that taking a picture of the computer screen and sending it to me would work better than just sending me the actual picture.

**EDIT**: My diet and workout really weren't complicated. I tried to eat between 3000-4000 calories a day with my main focus on protein and carbs. All I did was get about 2 or 3 pounds of meat, preferably red, daily and about a pound of cottage cheese (secret fucking weapon). I also ate a ton of brown rice and put cheese/ranch on everything. Plenty of milk, subway for lunch almost every day, and entirely too much heavy-ass beer.

Examples of meals: 

cheeseburgers, obviously

1.5 lb steak w/6 eggs and 2.5c cooked rice (2272 calories, 142g carbs, 255g protein)

rice and chicken (again, cheese)

pork chops and spaghetti

family size hamburger helper (1650 cal, 145g carbs, 115g protein)

stouffer's frozen lasagna (1450 cal, 150g carbs, 115g protein)

1 dozen eggs and 2 cans of spam (3320 cal, 18g carbs, 180g protein)

I've been eating entirely too much sodium but it's already pretty tough to get enough food without worrying about it. I ate 3-4 meals per day and didn't/don't take protein powder or mass gainers.

As for my workout, it was extremely simple. 

MWF: 

Bench 5x5

Pullups 3x8

Incline 5x5

High pulls 3x8

Decline 5x5

Bent-over rows 3x8

Dips 2 sets to failure

TTH:

Squat 5x5

DL 3x5

Front squat 3x8

sometimes Leg Press 3x5/5x5 depending on how I feel

Those are just the basics that I did every day. Of course I added in some accessory work and stuff, but it really all hinged on what I felt like doing when I got to the gym and how my muscles felt after each lift. If anyone has any questions or wants to know anything else, comment or PM me and I'll answer anything.

One year ago, weighing only 54kgs (119lbs) and being 1m79 (5'10"") at 20 years old, I decided to get my ass off of my computer chair and join a gym. 

Luckily i had a gymbuddy to go with, otherwise i would never have been able to keep myself motivated. It also took me quite a long time to not be afraid to go to the gym on my own. So 1 year later and my second 6 month gym subscription almost running out, I have just reached 65kg (143lbs), age 21, and decided to show you my progress.

*Before:* http://imgur.com/a/XeaDy

*After:* http://imgur.com/a/KtQU7


&gt; **Nutrition:**

To this date i still struggle to get enough calories in, that is the main reason why i switched from Whey Protein to Mutant Mass Gainer. Looking back at my progress this has definitely made a big difference.
I only drink 1 shake a day right after my workout, my budget doesn't really allow any more. 
I never really counted calories, although i do look for calorie-rich foods with still some decent nutritional values. I just try to eat as much as I can.

Things as eating a few spoons of peanut butter before bed and pouring some olive oil in my post-workout shake are becoming a habit.

I used to drink lots of milk but i had the feeling this was causing acne, so I cut that back a bit.
What i haven't cut back on is alcohol although I am aware that the hangovers this has caused might has set back my progress a little. 

&gt; **Sources of advice:**

* First of all the /r/gainit and /r/fitness community, thanks for that!
* Various people on youtube: twinmuscleworkout, rob riches, furiouspete123, PhysiquesOfGreatness and since recently CTFletcher.
* More experienced people at my gym.

&gt; **Problems along the way:**

* Shoulder issues; started feeling a kind of burning feeling in my left rear deltoid area after barbell bench press. Only lasted a few minutes and didn't interfere with my RoM but it still worried me a bit, asked around and googled for a solution. The most logical answer i found was that my shoulder deltoids might be out of balance, that could've been right since i didn't really train my rear deltoids back then.
	I switched over to dumbbells for a while, did some shoulder rehab exercises 	and i started hitting my rear deltoids during my shoulder workouts.

* Food.

* Tingling sensation in the middle of my back, left side right next to my spine. It's just 1 little spot where it always occurs and when I squeeze my back real tight for a second it goes away for a while. Haven't found a solution to this yet so if anyone recognizes this, please post it in the comments.

&gt; **Best for me (maybe tips for everyone?):**

* Form above all; I don't mind looking like a weaker person in the gym as long as I can do safe form and full RoM.
* Make that mind-muscle connection; Especially during back workout this makes a big difference for me.
* Watch your breathing; When i just started i didn't really think about my breathing, during bench pressing I would catch myself holding my breath during a few reps. You'll be able to push more reps out. While training abs, breath out when you're contracting.
* Don't be afraid to ask for advice; Most people in the gym are happy to help you
* Cliché: Put your ego aside in the gym; Who cares what people think of you as long as you're happy with what you're doing. 

&gt; **Routine:** Every exercise and weights are 3 sets (sometimes 4 on specific ones) of 10 reps
4 Days:

&gt; **Future goals:**

Sorry about the weird formatting...I clearly don't post very often.  This was over the course of a little over six months.  I had been lifting weights regularly prior to the original picture, but I got serious about eating and began Starting Strength at the end of January of 2012.  

I'm 23 years old and 6'1"".  I don't think this will be very popular, but if anyone is curious about my diet and current 1RM's then I'll gladly post them.  Good luck to the rest of you gainers!

Edit: 
Lifting Stats (I could estimate 1RM's but who really cares about those)  Program was SS as mentioned above:
* Before:
Squat: 135x5, Bench: 150x5, DL: 95x5 (Started low because I had never done deadlifts), OHP:55x5
* Current:
Squat: 260x5, Bench: 240x5, DL: 265x5, OHP: 145x5

Everything has been slowing down quite a bit lately, especially bench and OHP.  I've deloaded a couple of times on each lift and it has by no means been easy for me.  I'm planning to switch to something new within the next  month or so and would definitely appreciate advice/feedback about this.

Diet:  Nothing too strict about it as far as macronutrients go, but for the first three months I forced myself to get down a minimum of 3000 calories a day.  I kept track of this very closely (weighing food and measuring everything).  I drank a lot of protein and gainer shakes to hit that goal, and I recorded that I was around 175 some time in April-May.  After that I stopped keeping track, but I think I have a good sense for the amount I need to eat. The actual foods I eat the most are mixed green salads with plenty of meat and cottage cheese, more cottage cheese (seriously, all the time), oatmeal mixed with whey and PB for breakfast, Greek Yogurt and granola for snacks, and lots of canned chicken.  I eat very little fruit, but I get plenty of carbs from all the drinking I do on the weekends.  

Other tips:  Eat more than you think you should, every time.  If you're having trouble with your appetite then don't feel scared to smoke a little weed! (no joke, I think it helped me)

Edit 2: One caveat on this being 7 months of progress I should probably mention: I attempted to start in November of last year, but I fell off my bike and hurt my right shoulder (specifically my rotator cuff) pretty badly after about the third week, so I had to basically start over from square one after it started feeling better.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,1345000446.0,,,True,t3_y8j3o,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/y8j3o/hey_gainers_here_is_my_seven_month_148lb_to_191lb/,

***

People love looking at good progress pictures. People new to gaining can stand to learn many things from some of the more experienced members around here. Also, this subreddit could use some fresh content. With that in mind, please allow me to introduce the **r/Gainit Member Spotlight**.

**Premise**

The format will be a bi-weekly thread (posted Mondays) highlighting a different r/gainit member every iteration. The person in question will answer a short questionnaire, including pictures, which will then be posted by this account in the body of the spotlight thread. Other users may then ask further questions in the comment section, which this person will (hopefully) answer. In this way, each thread is essentially an AMA for the highlighted person.

**Philosophy**

The idea of this spotlight is to highlight active members of this community; those who contribute regularly. It is not meant to be a soapbox for those who otherwise contribute nothing to the sub. As such, I will be checking post histories. I won't be limiting this entirely to r/gainit members, but if the person does not at least contribute regularly in some kind of fitness/lifting/diet subreddit, I won't allow it. TL;DR: Active redditors only.

We also want to see real progress. I'm not going to put in a weight gained requirement, since fat loss/gain can skew these measurements. But let's limit this spotlight to those that have made significant progress. If your buddy started SS three months ago and has gained 10 pounds, that's great. But let's limit nominations to those who have been gaining for a significant chunk of time (1+ year) and have made significant gains. This will be at the discretion of the mods.

**Nominations**

Anyone here can nominate anyone else who falls under the above guidelines, by messaging this user account (/u/GainitSpotlight). Please spell their user name correctly. I will then contact that user, and send them the questionnaire. They will send back the answers, with pictures. I will then post the thread at a future date (and give the nominee advance warning so they can be active in the thread and answer questions). Note that you can nominate as many people as you want, whenever you want.

**Requirements**

* The nominee must be someone other than yourself.
* The nominee must have at minimum two photos. One ""after"" picture that clearly shows the development in the upper body **and** legs. Then, one ""before"" picture that clearly shows how far the nominee has come. Since most people don't have good before pictures, I'll be much more lenient on this one. It can be fully clothed as long as it's pretty apparent that you've gained a significant amount of mass from the before to after. Remember, the more photos the better. If you have photos from in between, by all means, include them. Feel free to blur out faces and identifying marks (eg, tattoos).
* The nominee must be present to answer questions in their thread. Don't worry, we can work around your schedule.

**Final Thoughts**

Sorry for the stringent rules, but I think it'll be better and easier to run with clear guidelines. So let's get started! Nominate your fellow users by posting here or messaging this account. I figure I'll do one spotlight every Monday for the first couple of weeks to get the ball rolling, and after that switch to the once every two weeks format (so we won't run out of people).

So depending on the amount of nominations, you may not see your spotlight for several months! Please be patient. Also, if I get a ton of nominations, I probably won't be able to respond to all of them. But rest assured, I probably got your message.

**Meals/suppliments**

I ate mostly clean foods whole grain pastas, chicken breasts, Grape nuts, bananas, almonds for between meal snack, mashed potatoes/sweet potatoes, lots of brown rice. The key was eating until I wanted to puke, then eating some more. Now that I am more conscious of calories I would estimate I was only eating 1500 calories a day when I was small. I wasn't watching my intake until about the last 2 months, which I realized I was eating about 3,500+ calories a day. Every day I would have 2 scoops of Syntha-6(delicious and easy to take with water). I started taking creatine about 3 months in, to be honest my gains are about the same since before, but my weight jumped up 5 lbs within the first week of taking it.  



I workout 6 days a week for about an hour and use a 3day split.
Every exercise I shoot for 3x10, when I could do over 12 reps I would up the weight.(x/x means I did one or the other on alternating days)

**Chest/Tri**

DB Press/Incline, DB OHP, Skull Crushers, DB Flies/Cable Crossovers, Dips, Triangle Pushups/Close grip BP, Side &amp; Lateral raise

**Back/Bi**

I've been browsing this page now for about 8 months, checking daily to see how you guys are doing! So i thought I'd post my progress pictures. It isn't a whole lot, but im happy. Cheers

Starting Date and weight: April 23, 2012. 140lb 
Current Weight: 174lb

My first few months of working out were only focused on upper body. Made a pretty big weight gain of 15lb, mainly from eating more and taking Mutant Mass as a supplement. From Aug - Dec i started going with a friend, and began the mon-fri 5 day split of each major muscle group (chest / back / legs / shoulders / arms). I gained a lot of strength with this routine, and put on another 10 lbs. I only used basic Isoflex Whey Protein for those months, as i was sick of calorie shakes


I am using it currently this 5 day split, but with new workouts added in. Im taking MAss Gainer protein shakes, and creatine pill similar to purple k. I've put on 9lbs so far since Jan 1/2013.

As far as my workouts, ive generally done 3-4 sets of each thing, increasing the weight between sets and maxing out each exercise on the last set. I used to do box squats from Aug - Dec, but ive since opted out for deeper squats, so my weight has dropped on those. Also started doing drop sets at the end of Bench Press, Squat and DL

Current Schedule:

Mon:Chest: Flat BB Press / Decline BB Press / Incline DB Press / Incline DB Rows / Medicine Ball DB Flat Press  + Abs at the end

Tues:Back: Pull Ups / BB Rows / Deadlifts / Lat Pull Down / Seated Rows / Lat pull down behind the head + Abs

Wed:Legs: Squats / DB Lunges / Leg Curl Machine / Leg Press Machine / Seated Calf Raises  and No abs 

Thurs:Shoulders: DB Shoulder Press / Front DB Raises / DB Reverse Flies / Behind the head BB Shoulder Press / Side Cable Raises / and Barbell close grip raise (dont know the proper term haha) + Abs

Fri:Arms: DB Hammercurls / Concentrated DB Curls / Chin Ups / BB Forearm curl / Tricep Ext / Dips + Abs

Main Current Lifts:

Flat BB Press - 225 for 2, 205 for 5, 185 for 8
Deadlift - 275 for 6, 315 for 1
Squat - 225 for 4, 185 for 8
Behind the head Shoulder BB Press - 115 for 8 (going up next week)


Diet right now consists of:
Breakfast - 2/3 cup of oatmeal, 1/4 cup of yogourt, 1/4 blueberries and 1/2 bagel w/ peanut butter

Snack - 2 hardboiled eggs, 1/4 cup yogourt, apple, 1/2 bagel with peanut butter

Lunch - (military mess food), so basically a meat (whether it be chicken, pork, haddock), i try to choose potato,rice or noodles if avaliable, and vegetables. 2 cups of chocolate milk

Snack - 1/2 bagel w/ peanut butter, banana

Workout and have a shake

Supper - ususally another basic meal with a main meat/side and veges.

Snack before bed - 1/2 bagel w/ peanut butte, shake,  and a big block of cheese.

I usually get around 4k calories a day. 

Heres some pics: first two are from before, the rest are as of today.Sorry, i dont know how to pose back very well.

I just wanted to share my tips for those looking to start gaining, and those who have not found success in gaining in the past.

I have attempted to gain weight multiple times, and I've never been able to get past a few pounds without failing. But now I've finally figured out what works for me. Here's how I finally figured it out, and here's some tips for you.

I always heard people tell me to go to the calorie calculators to figure out what I should be eating for maintenance, then add X amount of calories on to that per day. My problem with that is that I was always below what the maintenance showed to be for my height/weight. **Tip 1: Figure out what you normaly eat per day with a calorie COUNTER, then slowly add calories on to that until you are ~500-100 Calories over that per day. Don't use a calorie CALCULATOR to figure out what you should be eating**

I also had a hard time eating a lot of food. I even tried the GOMAD diet, and it worked for a while until I was out of the house so often that I couldn't carry milk everywhere. Liquid calories are much easier to take down, but I don't think they should be relied on. I always end up grabbing a glass to milk while I figure out what to eat, while I cook, or if nothing in my pantry/fridge looks tasty. **Tip 2: Try to eat as much food as you can during the day. Use GOMAD as your fall back if you're low on food, can't decide what to eat, don't feel like cooking, etc.**

Also, no matter how much I tried to stuff myself during the day, I always would end the day without hitting my calorie goal. Then I discovered mass gainers (I use ON Serious Mass). Now, I know that even if I don't actually reach my calorie goal per day, I will finish off the day with a serving of Serious Mass which pushes me over the edge. I don't rely on this, but it is nice to have that cushion at the end of the day. **Tip 3: Get a mass gainer and save it for the end of the day. If you end up not reaching your calorie goal, add one of those on to your day before you go to bed. Liquid calories are easy to take down, no matter how full you are.**

Last, but not least, I realized that I never had any solid motivation. My motivation used to be that I wanted to look better, be stronger, etc. While that may work for some people, it didn't for me. I'm not gaining weight for health reasons. I know I will be healthier with more weight. I know it's better for my body to have more muscle than I do now, and it also pushes me to go to the gym more often. **Tip 4: Find your own motivation, and make it real. Find something that (almost) forces you to do this, solidifying your WANT to do this.**

I hope this helps those that are having trouble or needed another push to get going.

tl;dr: Here are my personal tips for gaining weight. Basically, have a back up plan for getting your calories (GOMAD/Mass gainer) each day, and have some real motivation.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_177rnt,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/177rnt/tips_from_someone_who_has_failed_to_gain_weight/,

Edit 2: 
ROUTINE
 I go 5 days a week for about 1.5 hours a day. Generally I lift heavy as possible while trying to get 6-8 reps for 3 sets.
Chest • Flat, inclined, and declined bench. ( I'll switch between dumbbell presses and bench presses every few weeks). • Dumbbell flys • Cable flys • Wolverines • Push ups
Back • Dead lifts • Rows • Lat pull downs • Wide grip weighted pull ups
Shoulders • Shoulder press (Dumbbells or bar) • Arnold press at a lighter weight • A few cable work outs • Shrugs with Dumbbells or the Smith machine.
Legs • Squats • Leg press • Squats • Hamstring curls • Squats • Calf raises.. My gym has a few machines for calf workouts that I use. • SQUATS
Biceps • Weighted chin ups • Hammer curls • Push ups • I'll also use the cable machines and do curls there • 21s
Triceps • Weighted dips • Skull crushers • Push ups • Tricep pull downs • Close grip presses
As far as abs I try to do them every 3 days.  I do mason twists, waited sit ups with a medicine ball.  Scissors,  and 6 inches.

DIET:
I was really skinny from the start so I ate anything I could get my hands on.  My goal was to feel full all day.  It sucked at first but once you see gains it will motivate you.  I also did GOMAD for a month and a half and saw really good gains from it.  Now when I did it I didnt put on fat in one specific area it really just helped me fill out and look healthier (good genetics I guess).  I dont really want to add any more fat to my body so now I try to eat healthier. A lot of meats, eggs, oatmeal, milk, fruits and vegetables are all things I try to eat on a daily basis.

Supplements:

I take a weight gainer called Muscle Juice.  If I dont get enough calories for the day I'll mix this with a banana, peanut butter, and whole milk.  Its around 1000 calories.  

Post work out I take Torrent.  It's a bit pricey but me and most of my buddies will swear by it.  Definitely check it out.

I started the end of last June so this took me about 9 months.

For those who just want pics without all the other stuff, [see here](http://imgur.com/a/MxfOr)!

**LIFTING ROUTINE**

- Day A : Legs - squats, dead lifts, leg extensions, leg curls, calf raises
- Day B: Back &amp; Bi - pendlay rows, seated rows, dumbell curls, pull ups, ezbar curls, power cleans
- Day C: Chest &amp; Tri - bench, weighted dips, french press, dumbell flies, overhead press
- Day D: Rest

I just rotate days A-D, and take an extra rest day every 2 weeks or so.

**DIET**

I try to get about 3,000 calories, which I break up to around: 300g carbs, 160g protein, 100g fats

**Breakfast**

- 3 egg whites + 3 whole eggs + toast or
- 1 cup oats + protein shake if I don't have time to cook eggs

**Lunch**

I make myself a huge batch of the following meal, then put it into tupperwares to eat for lunch throughout the week. Each portion has the following

- 1/2 lb chicken (sliced and grilled)
- 1 cup brown rice
- 1/2 bag of frozen vegetables (peppers, onions, broccoli, corn, whatever) throw on whatever sauce you'd like. I like hot sauce or bbq or Szechuan

**Dinner**

- 1/2 lb chicken or 1/2 lb ground beef
- 1 cup brown rice
- 1 cup vegetables

**Snack**

I make a shake with the following ingredients and usually have 1, maybe two throughout the day, whenever I think I can drink it if I'm not too full

- 2 bananas
- 3 tbsp peanut butter
- 8 fl oz almond milk (you can use regular milk, I'm just lactose intolerant)
- 1 scoop protien

In general, I try to at least have a protein shake with a serving of creatine just before and just after when I lift. Then I have the peanut butter banana smoothie thing maybe twice a day whenever I can fit them in.

* What can I do to gain weight?
* What workout should I be doing?
* What kinds of food should I eat?
* How much am I supposed to eat?

I never thought I'd make a post like this, but I'm proud of how far I've come and hope a few of you can find motivation in my progress.

I was barely able to lift the bar when I started out. I had to use the 33 lb bar for the overhead press. I'm your typical keyboard jockey. I sit in front of a computer most hours of the day.

I've got a ways to go, but I figured I'd post anyway.

Sorry no leg pics. I haven't been ignoring them, though. I squat every time I lift.

Unfortunately I didn't take any pictures before I starting going to the gym, although during the first month I went whenever my friend wanted to go because I didn't have a pass yet, I was not eating enough/not counting calories, and I was not doing a split and basically did random stuff (mostly benching and curls ie bro workouts). The 1 month in pics are pretty accurate of what I looked like before hitting the gym.

**Diet &amp; Lifting Routine**

As for diet goes I basically started counting calories and tried to eat as much as I could. My TDEE was a little under 3000, so I aimed from around 3500 calories a day. After the 1 month mark I started drinking shakes, I did a lot of experimenting but eventually ended up with a shake containing some ON Mass Gainer, 2 scoops ON protein powder, 1 cup of Greek yogurt, and some milk and almond milk. It came out to about 800 calories, and I have been drinking this shake everyday until recently. Besides that I just tried to hit my calorie goal for the day, and I tried to buy things with protein in them and high calories. I ate a lot of nuts, bagels, and whatever else I could find. I also started taking Creatine some where in there, I'll probably continue taking it for the rest of my bulk, and maybe even longer. 

**My routine** was a 3 day split with 

* Day 1: Chest/Triceps/Shoulders 

* Day 2: Bicep/back

* Day 3: Legs and abs

* Day 4: Rest if I feel I need it

I basically just found various exercises online and made a routine from them, I think I covered all the muscles groups. If anyone wants the routine I could send it to them, but I don't think it is anything special :p I also didn't train legs for the first month, since I have been training them however, I have noticed some nice gainz. Unfortunately I go to Planet Fitness, so I cant do a lot of exercises, I plan to start going to my University's gym in the fall when it is free again. They should have more equipment and I'll be able to do deadlifts, and free bench/squat. 

 * **Edit Stating weight 155 Current weight 175 Goal weight 185**

**Thoughts**

I am really enjoying watching my body transform and gaining strength/muscle. I don't necessarily like eating 3500+ everyday, but hey you gotta do what you gotta do. I am enjoying my gainz and I think I will continue to bulk all the way til next winter and eventually cut for next summer. 

Thanks for reading! Questions, comments, critiques, etc. are all welcome!

 * **Edit**: **Exact Routine**

I plan to switch up my routine starting today, I feel its not that effective and I'm going to add/cut a lot of workouts to try to make it the best I can while I am still at PF. My friend and I basically made this routine up as we went, so I'm sure there are a lot of holes in it. When I transfer to my universities gym in the fall I will begin an actually pre-made workout routine ie starting strength or something like that. 

A lot of the names I used for this workout are from bodybuilding.com, so you can look them up there if you don't know what one is.

I'm up almost 30 pounds in just over a year, and I haven't felt or looked this good in a long time. Today, my sister who is visiting from college saw me for the first time in a few months. I was wearing one of the many t-shirts that has become much too small for me, and she turned and looked at me and said ""Wow, carrotjuicer. You look swole as fuck. You look like a man."" Verbatim.

(M/23/6'0"")",cdsparks,101,29,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1hl94v/its_been_6_months_and_ive_gone_from_149_lbs175/,"Before/After pics: http://imgur.com/WMD4uy0 -- picture on left is from a vacation in 2012, where I weighed 149 lbs. I started working out in January, and pictures on right are from yesterday, where I weighed 175.

So I've never been able to gain weight before this year, no matter how much I ate. Going into college, I weighed around 140, and even when I reached 6’0” I still weighed 149. I have always been in great shape, but was always been embarrassed at how skinny I was. When I took off my shirt at the beach, you could see abs, but you could also see my ribs through my chest. After I graduated a year ago, I knew I would have a gap year before I started grad school in the fall of 2013. I knew if I wasted this year and started grad school without changing my appearance, I would never set aside the time to do so, and I would regret it. So this past January, I decided to finally change all of it. I started lifting weights 4-5 times a week, cut out most of my cardio, and started eating a LOT more. I'll eat every 2-3 hours, whether it's a meal or a protein shake. So here was the schedule I used for the first 4 months (while I had a job). I changed it 2 months ago when I quit my job for the summer and had more time to work out (I’ll also include my new workout schedule further down).

7-day schedule (while employed)
-----
Monday: Chest/Back
Tuesday: Shoulders/p90x's Ab Ripper x (a 15-min ab workout at home)
Wednesday: Legs
Thursday: Ab Ripper x
Friday: Biceps/Triceps
Sat &amp; Sun: rest

(here's a link to the ab ripper video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qghZZ9yopno)

I did a lot of research on the best ways to bulk for people who aren’t also trying to cut fat, and like 90% of the things I read recommended reducing the amount of cardio exercises, so I didn't ever run or things like that. After I quit my job for the summer, I had more time to work out every day, so I changed to a 5 day schedule:

5-day schedule
-----
Day 1: Chest/ab ripper x
Day 2: Shoulders (a.m.)/Back (p.m.)
Day 3: Legs/ab ripper x
Day 4: Biceps (a.m.)/Triceps (p.m.)
Day 5: Rest

So here's the schedule of exercises I’ve done for each workout. Every exercise I do in every workout, I do 4 sets of 8-10 reps. I like doing straight sets with each exercises, which means I’ll do all 4 sets of each exercise before I move on to the next. I didn't start doing that until about a month ago, but I really like it. And I would choose the weight so that I'm having to struggle to get the 10th, but not until then.

Chest:
Flat bench press
Incline bench press
Decline bench press
Chest Flyes

With each of these chest exercises, I liked to do 2 sets with a normal bar, and 2 with dumbbells. Dumbbells allow a normal range of motion vs. a fixed range with a bar, and you can bring them together at the top in order to squeeze your chest muscles and work them harder, which you can’t do with a bar.

Back:
Bent-over dumbbell rows
Shoulder shrugs with dumbbells
Seated machine rows with a pulley machine
Lat pull-downs with pulley machine
Back extensions on machine

Shoulders:
Seated dumbbell shoulder presses
Standing front shoulder raises with dumbbells
Standing side shoulder raises with dumbbells
Reverse Pec-Deck Flyes

Legs:
Squats (on a free bar/squat rack, not a machine)
Calf raises (either on a machine or squat rack)
Leg extensions on machine
Leg curls on machine
Anterior leaning lunges
Leg Presses

Biceps:
Dumbbell curls
Seated Preacher curls with a bar
Hammer curls with dumbbells
Seated dumbbell isolation curls

Triceps:
Laying down tricep extensions with dumbbells
Tricep pushdown with pulley machine and rope attachment
Tricep kick-backs
Tricep dips (either on a machine, or on a pull-up station)

So if you have the time to go to the gym twice a day on the days with 2 exercises, I’ve found it’s better to do all of the exercises for one muscle group at a time, rather than mix in other muscle groups in a circuit. If not, then it seems to be best to split it up so that you do one muscle group a day, but only have 1 rest day at the end of the week or something, if that makes sense.

If you only have time to go to the gym 3 or 4 times a week, and need to combine several muscle groups in one workout, you can work them into a circuit. Like, if you’re doing biceps/triceps at the same time, you can do bicep curls, move to tricep extensions, then back to bicep curls, then tricep extensions, etc. until youve done 4 sets of each, then move to the next 2 exercises.

As far as protein/supplements, I did a lot of research a while ago on which things help the most, and when to take them during the day, and here's the schedule I came up with, so that I'm either eating a meal or drinking a protein shake every 2-3 hours: right when I wake up I drink a whey protein shake (chocolate has always tasted the best to me), you can get them at wal-mart for like $16 for 2 lbs of it. With the shake I'll take a multivitamin, some glutamine and some branched chain amino acids (both are in pills like a vitamin), and a fish oil pill. Then in a bit I’ll have breakfast, then in between lunch and when I work out I'll have a protein shake and add in 5 mg of creatine. Then I'll work out, and immediately after I'll have 5 mg of creatine and glutamine, and either dinner or a protien shake. Then another protien shake immediately before bed. I’ve aimed to eat/drink 1 g of protein for each pound that I’ve aimed to weigh. I’m planning on continuing to bulk until around 185 lbs, then start cutting. 

Well that’s about all I can think of that I’ve done/found to work. So after all of this, if you’re a super skinny guy like I was and can’t ever put on weight, there’s hope! If I’ve left anything out that you’d like to know, let me know! Or if you have any advice on things you would change in order to help me keep up this progress, I'd love to hear it!

My thoughts:

* Take photos the day you decide to start lifting, make sure they are in adequate lighting and get photos of your back, legs and chest and any others you want.
* Try to get on free weights as soon as possible, I think I felt safer on the machines but it is much better to use free weights, even if they are lighter than what you can do on the machine. 
* Avoid the smith machine if you can help of it, just use the free weight bar even if there is barely any weight on it.
* Try to log what your starting lifts were, when you come back to it in a year, it will feel great.
* Don't be scared of the deadlift, get on youtube watch form videos and try it out, just don't build up the weight too much until you get your form right.
* When buying your gym clothes, do not buy slim fit tops - you will grow out of the them in a month. Try and get a bigger top, and you will just have to live with the bagginess for a month or so. 
* The same goes for any clothing in the first few months, you will grow out of it, just wait a few months until the initial gains slow down.
* Gym footwear, if you are not doing much cardio, you do not need running shoes with spongy heels, try and get a firm heeled shoe - chucks or converse are fine.
* Your legs aren't big from all that cycling and football you play, start training straight away and don't wait a month. 
* Chances are you are quarter squating, get deep now and you will avoid injury further down the line - along with the bad feeling of dropping your weight when you realise you have not been squating correctly.
* Do not tell anyone that you are planning to gain weight, after 3-4 months people will notice and they won't judge you in the early stages. 
* Practice good form on the squats, even if you are just using the bar you will gain respect of the strong members of the gym. 
* Do not worry that others are doing a four day split or something else, being new you are able to lift with roughly the same routine 3 times a week and not be fatigued.
* If you are struggling for calories, start eating peanut butter sandwiches - just eat it slowly when watching tv or on your computer.

My lifts

Bench: 135 &gt; 225lbs

Squat: 185 &gt; ~300lbs

Dead Lift: (???)(I workout at home. I know, I really should find a way to work this in)

For the first month I gained a lot of fat, as I just needed some weight to get me started. I did GOMAD for the first month and quickly put on 15 pounds. I'm sure much of it was fatty tissue. 

Currently my meals include 

**Breakfast:** 2-5 eggs. 5 Large Strawberries. A banana. Blueberries. Large spoonful of peanut butter. Large glass of milk.

**Lunch:** .75lbs of chicken cooked in olive oil. I try and be lighter on the salt with seasoning. A garden mix of greens topped with olive oil balsamic vinegar. Tomatoes added. 3 or so strawberries on the side. Water or milk. Depending on how I feel about my intake lately. 

**Dinner:** Tilapia/Salmon/Chicken or some sort of beef. Veggies and greens as a side along with grapes, strawberries, and whatever other fruits I feel like adding to the mix. 

 **Snacks:** Mixed nuts. Fruit/Protein shake (banana, strawberries, almond milk or milk, blueberries, peanut butter, coconut oil, protein whey if I'm taking it) The shake/smoothie is probably around 800cals. At my peak intake I was taking two of these per day on top of my meals. 


Supplements; ON Whey Protein, 4g of Creatine, Multivitamin. 

All told I put down about 3000-3500 cals a day. 

I haven't been on the Whey Protein for a while, but when I was using it I'd average a scoop or two a day for an additional 25-50g of protein.

**Workout Routine**

When I first started I was doing P90X. It was pretty difficult to keep up with those guys in the beginning, but after a while I needed to move on to something more advanced/free weights. 

Now a days I try my best to stick to PHAT. The details of which [can be found here](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html)

**Monday**

(Heavy Upper Power Day)

Bent Over Rows

Different variations of Pullups

Flat and Incline Dumbell Presses

Bench Press

Dips/ChairDips

Skull Crushers

**Tuesday**

(Heavy Lower Power Day)

Squats

Pistol Squats

Heavy Lunges

Calf Raises

**Wednesday**

Rest

**Thursday**

(Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy Day)

Full arm extension flys (I have no idea what their called, sorry)

Shoulder flys

Upright Rows

Dumbbell Rows

Pullups

**Friday**

(Lower Body Hypertrophy Day)

Squats (3x10)

Pistol Squats

Weighted Lunges

Calf Raises, etc. 

**Saturday**

(Chest and Arms Hypertrophy)

Bench

Dumbbell flys

Incline Dumbbell Press

I mix in core/abs type stuff here and there when I feel like it

Each workout lasts up to an hour, and I try to make a point to push myself and keep the intensity high during every workout. This to me, is the most important thing. As of now I'd really like to work on my chest and legs some more. And obviously just size in general. 


I also got into Muay Thai for the evenings. Fighting is pretty good for your core

So thats it. I lost a ton of weight once I started up college and my focus changed. I went from 5'10"" 160 to 6'0"" 140 in a few years time. Luckly I had that experience so I knew what it took to get back into the swing of things. I don't see myself stopping my progress. I'd like to be 185lbs within a years time. Hopefully just as lean or leaner. Maybe then I'll make a second post. Feel free to ask me anything at all! I'm nowhere near done and you guys help keep my motivated! Thanks for reading!

My lifting routine, 3 days a week.
http://imgur.com/39vP8Ao
I have only been doing this routine for 2 months. The first month I was doing a 4 day split.
I try and add 2.5lbs to upper body and 5lbs to lower body excersices each work out. But since I don't have the option to add 2.5lbs evenly on the bar I just add 5lbs every other time I do those exercises.

My current numbers are
185lbs squat
120lbs bench
100lbs barbell row
75lbs OHP
145lbs DL

My diet consists of a lot of chicken, beans, beef, and milk. I have a lot of food allergies so I'm limited to what I can eat. Breakfast at 5:15am I eat a big bowl of Greek yogurt with fiber one cereal mixed in and a banana. Second breakfast at 8-8:30am, 2 chicken thighs and about 3/4 can of pinto beans and about 30oz of whole milk. Lunch at 11:30am usually a foot long meatball sub or double meat turky sub from subway. Days I go to the gym, I get an extra 6"" sub and eat that at about 3:30-4pm. Days I don't, I'll just drink about 20oz of milk at that time. After gym at about 7pm I eat about a 1lbs steak, or some chicken with close to a whole can of pinto beans and a large glass of whole milk. And before bed at around 9pm pretty much anything I can that doesn't require cooking. 

Any questions or comments would be appreciated!

Edit: I'm doing the second version of the lifting routine.
Edit 2: the numbers are my weight I do reps with. I haven't checked my 1RM in a while.

After failing to really be serious, my mindset on the matter just clicked one day and I knew I was for real this time. 

I started at 110lbs and began to lift at the gym. I did, and still do, a split body workout 4-5 times a week. Chest/triceps one day, back/biceps another, and shoulders/legs another day. My lifts were weak at first, but I'm slowly growing stronger and gaining weight. I'm currently at 132 pounds with a goal weight of 140-145. 

I am tracking my caloric intake daily with MyFitnessPal, and I have discovered I am not eating enough calories to put on the mass that I want to. I plan on really buckling down and ensuring I eat enough, as my caloric needs are increasing due to my increase in weight. 

I currently have a goal to eat 3000 calories daily, but I've averaged about 2450. Once I get my nutrition under control better, I should be able to hit my goal weight in the next few months.

Trainer: ""Oh, you're doing squats every workout - there's no need for that, and you'll probably injure yourself. Squats are a once a week exercise.""

Me: ""Ok, cool. Can you check my form on the squat today though""

Trainer: ""Sure. Ok well there are a few things wrong. First, you need to look up at the ceiling when doing squats, this is for balance. (or something, I dunno, I'd read SS just hours ago and was ...'d) Your knees seem to be buckling outwards, you're supposed to bring them in when you rise. Anyway, you obviously fail at squats, so how about I show you this machine. This is a hack squat""

Me: (A hack squat? Yeah, 'cos I want hack legs and hack strength) ""...""

Trainer: ""You drink a shake?""

Me: ""Yeah, I use two scoops, cup of full cream milk, 2 cups oats, banana, berries and PB""

Trainer: ""WHOA"" (like he'd never heard of someone doing that before) ""How much are you eating a day?""

Me: ""I'm aiming for 3000-3300kcal and 1g/lb protein, I've failed at improving at the gym in the past so I'm keeping it really simple. I minimise fat where I can...""

Trainer: ""Ok 3000kcal is *way* too many calories for one day. You're going to get fat. You're doing three lifts per session? That is nowhere near enough"" ""Here's a gym ball"" 

This is where things got awkward. I had read a post about a similar experience a few days before, and was glad I did, because it gave me cause not to be a pussy and just tell the guy it wasn't going to work. I like to think I handle myself well in these situations but I had to be careful not to come off rude or arrogant while implying the 15-year experienced trainer didn't know what he was talking about. 

He also used buzzwords like ""functional strength"" and ""muscle confusion"". I should have just given up the second he got me to do medium intensity cardio to warm up.

All said and done, it was a free session, he's a salesman and representative of the gym. I know he needs to consider liability and stuff like that. I get it. It did, however, make me realise the power those people have to influence. There is so much misinformation out there, some of which has probably worked for him and his peers and students for years. 

And one more things to end the rant, he's now is coming up to me and yelling numbers. I'll be doing 3x5 and he's like ""MORE!! SIX!! SEVEN!! YOU CAN DO IT""

So anyway here's my story.

Growing up, I never really cared about fitness.  I was that topical teenage skinny boy who was just glad that I didn't have tits or something.  Around graduation, I started to notice my skinny arms and ribs and it became a huge discouragement. I also had a pretty annoying problem with acne because of my bad diet.  How could someone as small as me even start to gain.  Fast forward to freshman year.

It all started with my freshman crush, which I can understand why it's called that now.  After she told me she was not interested, I started to look at myself and wonder, why?  I started to go down a road of slight depression.  It wasn't till a buddy of mine invited me to the gym for the first time  that I started my climb out.  

It started with that typical starter mentality of ""I'll work out a bunch and then I'll have to get big.""  I took no time to look at my diet and actually plan out a program.  I had no time to learn, I just wanted all the benefits.  I also started running which combined with my bad diet caused weight gain to halt to a stop.

About 6 months after started, another friend of mine introduced me to this little thing called crossfit.  I had never had my butt kicked so hard before.  It was a whole new level of fitness that really pushed me to make big changes in my diet.  I cut out soda entirely, most sugar and fried foods.  I started earing clean balanced foods.  Then FINALLY the weight started to come, but it was a slow crawl.  

I'm now 2 1/2 years into my fitness journey and it has become something that I will take with me for the rest of my life. I do not see me stopping anytime in the near future.  I just hope I have a similar story to someone else.

Pics are Feb 2012 vs July/August 2013

Relatively new to this subreddit but I’ve been trying to gain for about two years, however I only learned and committed to eating properly about 16 months ago, and my progress has been almost entirely since then.

It’s been a bit of a complicated/unconventional road. I started off quite thin and unhealthy. I have abnormally long arms which is lets say... challenging, for most strength work. My wife and I try to eat extremely healthy (as organic and hormone free as we can), and I have to deal with some significant dietary restrictions. (more on that later)

At 31 a friend (equally skinny) and I started going to the gym very casually, maybe once a week. It was decent, but I had no idea what I was doing. I could only bench the bar, and I had critically low energy at this time in my life. Deep down  knew I couldn’t stick with it, it was too busy, too expensive, and too inconvenient for me to really commit to going regularly. We were discussing how there had to be a better way to get fit at home without a lot of money and space consuming equipment. A few weeks later he mentioned hearing about the book Convict Conditioning on reddit. I was very quickly addicted to bodyweight training, the philosophy really appealed to me. (simple, free, anywhere/anytime, and in my mind fitness should be all of those things)

So that summer (2011) I started bodyweight training as suggested in CC, which is a very slow start, particularly if you’re unhealthy and long limbed.

I had no idea how to eat at the time so 6 months in I had barely gained anything, a couple lbs maybe. Following a minor surgery scare at that point I got serious about getting healthy and strong and started researching and ran into the age old advice, ""you are just not eating enough"". I started tracking calories and was coming in around 1200 - 1500 a day, absurdly low. I ramped that up, nothing hugely complicated, just targeting 2200 at first, I only tracked for awhile to get an idea what was necessary, but it was enough.

Workouts

I stuck with convict conditioning for most of this time, 3 workouts a week with 1-2 days rest in between. One day for types of pushups and hanging leg raises, one day for pullups and squats, and one day for handstand pushups and bridging. 

I’ve experimented with bodyweight666 and most recently the /r/bodyweightfitness subreddit, but CC was my bread and butter for most of this time. Lately I’ve returned to CC and just started mixing in some “opposition” sets at the end. (i.e. on vertical pushing (HSPU) day, I close with some horizontal pushing (regular pushups) with whatever energy is left)

I love CC but also have some criticisms of it. I took my time with it, as advised, but to this day I don’t know if that was the right decision or not. CC has you spending an absurdly long time before even hitting exercises like a full push-up or pull-up, especially with my body type. Some of the rep ranges are completely out of wack and it’s very de-motivating to spend a year or more working out and not be doing full pushups, or completely unable to get a pullup. (that took me a year and a half to get a clean rep) On the other hand though, I did gain mass, and I have never injured myself.

I can’t give my current “lifts” obviously. :) I don’t train for volume but currently am working on diamond pushups with the end goal being a 1 arm pushup, jacknife pullups + trying to transition to full pullups (can only get 1-2), hanging straight leg raises, full back bridges, pike/box handstand pushups, easier forms of dips, and what CC calls “uneven squats”, basically starting to transition to 1 leg pistol squats.

Diet

I’ve had stomach trouble my whole life. I don’t know how common this is for “hardgainers” but I didn’t eat enough because I found no joy in doing so, food was associated with digestion problems for me. Occasional unpredictable IBS attacks, lots of pain gas and bloating, etc. Doctors have never been able to give me any effective guidance with this.

When I started out I was already on a diet without lactose, wheat, and things like beef and corn. I started eating an egg or two every morning with my toast/fruit. Meals were typically rice / rice pasta / potato, pork/chicken/fish, and salad, I just focused on eating more of it. I found an all natural whey protein at GNC with nothing weird in it which was a major help, great in a berry + OJ smoothie. Snacks were usually potato chips and granola bars. I gained about 20 lbs on this diet.

Late in 2012 though the stomach problems started to increase quite severely, the list of foods that seemed to set me off kept growing and growing. I had to back off the calories and eat easier and just maintained my weight for about four months until I’d had enough and found a good naturopath this April. We sat down and she asked a lot of questions, took a blood sample and sent it off. Next session she came back with a depressing verdict of both potato and sugar intolerance.

This sucks because it rules out a ridiculous amount of modern food, everything “enriched”, most yeasts, regular iodized table salt, all kinds of strange vitamins and additives they cultivate with potato, not to mention everything with sugar in it. I literally have to skip 90% of what you’d find in a supermarket. If it’s in a box/bag, it will almost always have some form of sugar or potato additive. 

I took a leap of faith and tried to cut it all out though. I had nearly immediate improvements, less stomach trouble meant more desire to eat. Started gaining immediately again, ran up almost 10 lbs in 2.5 months (an unprecedented rate for me) and actually decided to back off and burn the little gut I was developing, something I’d *never* done before. Energy spiked quite nicely, started bouncing back from workouts much better, sleeping a little less, overall a big improvement, so (unfortunately) I am nearly positive she was right.

So while my diet is now *extremely* restricted and very expensive (we generally try to eat organic / hormone free / etc), I get by with eggs, alternative grain breads (spelt/kamut), rice, meat/fish, whey protein smoothies, and some granola bars that have no refined sugar which are a little tough to find but they are out there. I started doing things like mixing some coconut oil into my green tea for a little bonus, olive oil + lemon juice to flavor rice and meat/fish, drinking more fruit juices, etc. I currently aim for about 2700 calories, I don’t track every day but only occasionally to make sure I’m in the ballpark, and when I push to hit that number, I start gaining weight.

I have mixed emotions on the results at times, mostly because so far it’s nothing particularly astonishing. It’s more of a transition from freakishly skinny and unhealthy to normal. My arms in particular disappoint me, they’ve certainly grown but they still look quite skinny. I’ve made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot, but there’s still a lot of work left to do. I’m learning to think of  those long arms as just more room for muscle. I am hopeful that chinups/pullups will be the answer for the arms, still not strong enough to do full versions of these regularly.

I have grown to love the flexibilty / convenience / savings of bodyweight training though, mostly because it’s so easy to stick to. I think it’s a very viable option for those looking to gain, probably slightly less effective than lifting though, but not by a huge margin. I can’t target specific areas as easily and sometimes it’s a bit tricky to jump from one exercise to a harder one, certainly harder than just adding weight to a bar. Overall though it’s a good fit if you’re anti-social and frugal. 

Love watching this subreddit these last few months, thanks all for your contributions. This place is by far the best resource I’ve ever found for gaining, I just wish I’d known about it when I started two years ago.

I was on the bus from school and had tons of gas. I held the gas in for as long as possible but couldn't do it anymore. I got dizzy from holding in my farts. 
I quietly let a long fart out and right off the bat I knew it was a protein fart. They feel differently than normal farts. I was reading my e-reader and pretended nothing happened. The person sitting next to me gags and pulls his shirt over his nose, grabs a piece of gum and breaths into his shirt, distressed over the smell. A guy standing directly in front of me smelt it and shifted uncomfortably. A few times he stuck his head up as if to reach for clean air.
I sat in my seat with a cringed look on my face and would look up and down at my e-reader as if to catch the culprit. 
It felt like an eternity for the smell to pass and when it did, I realized it had been a mere 2 blocks. No one looked at me and I'm pretty sure everyone knows it was me. I felt so alleviated.

It's people refusing to accept that having a fast metabolism is a myth or that you really need to go to the gym in order to get bigger fast.

People are shy and want to stick to their own confirmation bias and have external factors outside of their control be the reason for why they can't improve but in reality it's up to us to make a change. If you want to get bigger it's simple, you have to eat more and go to the gym. You can make up excuses about not having time for the gym or money for food but if it's something you really want you will make sacrifices of instant gratification to achieve your long term goals. Just go out and do those simple things and you will improve. It will suck at the start but once you get past the shitty start it gets so much easier and you start to feel much better about yourself.

Routine:  Hasn't been super strict in the way of workout order.  If I'm well rested and feel like hitting a certain body part I will go ahead and do it providing I've allowed for proper rest. This whole process has been constant trial and error but as of now I go 4 days on and then take a rest day and repeat.

I did play sports in high school and we had to lift weights but it never amounted to anything much.  I took the make it look like im doing something so the coaches wouldn't yell at me but actually don't lift weights approach.

**Lift Numbers** (start - current)

Bench Press: 155 - 215

Squat: 185 - 285

Deadlift: 235 - 345

OH Press: 95 - 135




**Day 1 Chest/Triceps**: 

Flat Barbell Bench Press - Warmup followed by 3 working sets at 10-8-6 reps respectively.

Incline Dumbbell Press - Warmup followed by 3 working sets at 10-8-6 reps respectively.

Incline Dumbbell Fly - 3 x 12 (sometimes supersetted with Incline Dumbbell Press)

Cable Crossover - 2 x 12 for Upper and Lower chest each (4 sets total)

Chest Dips - 3 x failure

Close Grip Bench Press - 3 x 10

Skullcrushers - 3 x 10-12

Cable one arm rope pulldown - 3 x 12-15

Tricep Pulldown - 3 x 12

**Day 2 Back/Biceps**:

Deadlift - 3 x 5

T Bar Row - 4 x 10-12

Pull Up/Chin Up - 2 x failure ( usually 12-15)

Seated Cable Row - 4 x 12

Close Grip Lat Pulldown - 3 x 10

Barbell Curl - 3 x 10

Dumbbell Curl - 3 x 10

Hammer Curl - 3 x 10

**Day 3 Shoulders/Legs**:

Squats - 3 x 5

Lunges - 3 x 10 

Leg Press - 3 x 12-15

Calf Raises - A shitload but they never grow

OH Press - 3 x 5

Military Press - 3 x 8-10

Rear delt fly - 3 x 12 (dropset on last set)

Lateral Raise supersetted with front raises - 3 x 12

**Day 4 Arms (Just started doing this 2 weeks ago)**:

My arms day consists of every tricep exercise from day 1 combined with every bicep exercise from day 2.  I may substitute an exercise or two if im getting bored like switching skullcrushers to overhead tricep extensions or dumbbell curl to preacher curl.

**Summary**:  Trial and error has gotten me to where I am now.  I was consistent for the first 3 months that I was lifting but with an awful split (literally just a chest/triceps day and a back/biceps day) and going 3-4 times a week.  Then I took a two month break where I didn't have a gym available because I was home from college for winter break/was stupid and didn't lift for the first month back at school after break.  Kept that pretty awful split going until April where I finally started doing legs! Didn't start doing shoulders until this summer and it shows.  Then I just threw an arms day in there because I figured why not.

If you have any questions feel free to pm me or comment.  And if I missed anything please point it out.  Diet is in a comment but I can copy into the post if thats an issue.

* 1. Lifting like a savage beast and beating PRs.
* 2. Eating 250kcal-500kcal more than you are expending.

Many people over-complicate both. The following is how to get big and strong, without the bullshit.

* **1. Lift Heavy and Hard... (and stretch!).**

* Aim for 5 sets of 5 reps on each exercise. For now.

* Deadlift
* Squat
* Bench
* Rows
* Pull-Ups
* Mobility drills

Beat your PRs every workout. Aim to lift 5lbs more than last time. If you can't, aim to do one more set. If you can't, aim to do one more rep. If you can't, take an extra rest and try that rep one more time until you do.

* **2. Eat Muscle Food.**

* Eat the foods below so you are eating 250kcal-500kcal over your *maintenance*.
* Maintenance = BMR + Energy Expended Daily + Energy Expended in Exercise.
* 
* 
* Example: 150lbs BW, 5' 7"", 10% Bodyfat, sedentary/little activity.
* Maintenance = 1725kcal (BMR) + 300kcal (Avg. daily energy) + 400kcal (60min Strength Training).
* **To Gain** = 2775-2925kcal (2425kcal Maintenance + 250-500kcal).
* If you do not train, do not eat calories necessary for training (400kcal in example).

Instead of trying to put this all in a neat paragraph I am just going to list it.  These first few ones were probably the most helpful to me personally:

* Stop smoking (appetite suppressant)
* Stop drinking coffee (appetite suppressant)
* Substitute water or whole milk for all beverages, especially soda
* Meal replacement bars eaten before breakfast (This was a big one, I am always so busy in the mornings that being able to scarf down a bar seriously jump-started my metabolism right off the bat)
* Nuts : almonds, peanuts, cashews (easy to eat, healthy, not too filling; I honestly keep a bag in my pocket to munch on at all times; If you don't like nuts try adding chocolate)
* Dark chocolate with almonds (LOL since I don't like almonds)
* Peanutbutter on everything
* Cook everything with Coconut Oil
* Added heavy whipping cream to my gainer shake
* Added pasteurized raw eggs 
* Oatmeal (sparingly, since it is filling)
* Rice (sparingly, since it is filling)
* Cheese
* Traditional greek yogurt (none of that 0% fat crap)

**NOTE** I have celiac disease so gluten is a no-go for me (in case you were wondering why there were no breads or pasta on this list; I probably wouldn't have included them anyways since they can be too filling)

I just try and eat constantly without over-eating, getting sick, and then not feeling up to eating what I need to.  Hope these help my fellow skinny guys with small appetites!

Routine: I lift 3x a week and run anywhere between 0-2 times a week depending on the nature of my weight gain. My gains are slow but clean and I very rarely have to cut weight. It took me about a year to get into a routine to where I was making consistent progress but I did notice a considerable increase in mass after I ditched machines. I don't have an exclusive ""leg day"" which may be a major point of criticism in my schedule--rather I favor staying at the gym longer to work more parts than coming in more frequently and narrowing my focus. I may consider changing my regime up to accomodate that. 

Diet: I plan on eating ~2500 calories a day but sometimes this stretches to 3000 if I feel I *really* worked hard. I'm a fan of the Pure protein bars and the Cliff bars (each have ~20g protein). These are almost always my breakfast and mid-afternoon snack. Most of my protein comes from chicken, turkey and fish--I only celebrate with red meat. I shoot for at least 160g of protein a day. Creatine is not a part of my diet.

I've been lurking on here for a month or so now and I really enjoy seeing other peoples progress shots so I thought it was probably time to contribute. I'll try to be as thorough as I can, though it might be tough as I've only just really started to track my progress in numbers.

I've always been tall and skinny, and have always just told people that I eat loads/have a fast metabolism. I had never been one for exercise, but I have always worked a job that had me on my feet for 8 hours a day. 

I flew out to Australia in October 2011 for one year and started working as a labourer on a building site, two of the lads that worked there were hugely into their fitness/gains and really tried hard to motivate me to hit the gym/eat properly but I never really considered doing it. 

Heres a couple of shots of me - http://imgur.com/a/ON1rJ#FExHzDI

The first is July 2012, after 5 months work labouring (dat haircut.) The second is from July 2011, at my standard size. 

At the end of my Australia trip (October 2012) I just thought fuck this I'm going to give it a go. I flew home to the UK, got a mate to put a routine together for me and first hit the gym in the 1st week of November. I didn't pay much attention to what I was eating, but I did take a massgainer/protein shake about 3 times a day and 5g of creatine a day.

I had actually stopped drinking/smoking as well so I felt pretty motivated.

My routine consisted of:

**Chest and Triceps**  

* 3x10 Dumbbell Bench Press
* 3x10 Incline Dumbbell Bench Press
* 3x10 Dumbbell Flys 
* 3x10 Assisted Tricep Dips
* 3x10 Tricep Cable Pull Down

**Back and Biceps** 

* 3x10 Assisted Wide Grip Pull Up
* 3x10 Seated Dumbbell Bicep Curls
* 3 sets of 21's (bicep curls) on the EZ bar
* 3x10 Concentration Curls
* 3x10 Wide Grip Lat Pulldown
* 3x10 Close Grip Pulldowns

**Thursday - Shoulders**

* 3x10 Shoulder Press with Dumbbells
* 3x10 Lateral Raises with Dumbbells
* 3x10 Front Raises with Dumbbells 
* 3x10 Shrugs with Plates in hand or Olympic bar

I did that for the first month  - here are the pics of me two weeks in (quality isn't so great.) 

http://imgur.com/a/4Y8YT#LOr41Na

Just before Christmas I started to eat properly. I kept a food diary and tracked my calories, making sure I was between 3500-4000 a day. I started training my legs too *(had to actually persuade my gym partner it was a good idea, he's a big guy too).*

Here's my **Leg day**

* 3x10 Squats
* 3x15 Calf Press (Machine)
* 3x15 Hamstring Curls (Machine)
* 3x15 Hip Abductor (Machine
* 3x15 Hip Adductor (Machine)

Here is an album of more progress. The first pic is December 28th 2012. The second and third are from 20th January 2013.

I haven't actually seen much weight gain at all tbh, I put on a couple of Kilos in my first month but that seemed to subside and I settled back down to 77kg after. I can't say exactly what I weighed in say 2011, but I know it was between 74-76 Kg.

In terms of strength, my Dummbell Bench press has soubled - from 3x10 of 24kg (about 55lb) to 3x10 of 48kg. I've seen similar gains in strength in most exercises, it's really motivating to move up the rack.

My legs still feel pretty weak, I'm still getting used to Squats to be fair (squatting 35kg, which includes the 15kg bar), but I'm hoping to see gains soon!!

The one change I've made recently is to drop down from 10 reps to 8 on most exercises, and go for the biggest weight I can - keeps my workout shorter and I feel i'm working harder. Also I don't take a weight gainer shake any more, I'm just on the Gold Standard Whey Powder.

Any critique you guys can give would be much appreciated - I've learnt loads on here and am so glad I've found such a wealth of knowledge. I'm LOVING the SVUNT shakes too btw :D

The struggle to satisfy your calorie needs will get a lot easier with these.

.

**required time:** 25 min

**required skills:** a degree in rocket science

**required utensils:** a bowl, baking paper

.
___________________________________________________________

.

**For the basic substance You need**

* 200 grams (2 cup) of **oats**
* 200 grams (1^1/2 to 2 cup) of **protein powder** of your choice
* 250 to 300 grams (1 to 1^1/2 cups) of **peanut butter**^1
* some **milk**
* about 3 spoons of **honey** (or more if you like it sweet)
* ground **nuts or flax**
* for the taste: whatever you like, for example dried fruits or cacao

.

^1) you can also use peanut mousse which is entirely out of peanuts

.
___________________________________________________________

.

Now here's how you do it: the steps are **very difficult**, require a LOT of cooking and baking experience and you need to follow them **exactly**.

 So if you feel up to it, try your luck.

.


**how they're made:**


.

**1)** throw everything in a bowl

**2)** Mix it with your hands until its a sticky mass

**3)** done 

(no baking required!)

.


If you made it this far, don't worry, the rest is easier.

.


**4)** Put the mass on a baking paper as seen in [this picture](http://imgur.com/m6kku0B&amp;muHbRBt) and form a nice long block. (it's the finished product put you get the idea... i hope)

**4.1)** Put the nuts or flax on it, so it doesn't stay sticky

**5)** put it in the refrigerator until its hard (30 min)

.

.

___________________________________________________________

They contain A LOT of **calories, carbon hydrates and protein.**

You can experiment with the flavor by adding different stuff.

.

One of these bars should be enough for **a week** and you can store it for like.. 10 days if it's cooled.

.

.

If you use cups you will get a bit less, because of conversion and stuff

.

I hope you enjoy it

.

.

**TL;DR:** if you're to lazy to read this you better buy meal replacement bars at a store.

6 months ago, I was 19 years old, 6'2, 140lbs. 
I got deep into lifting / bulking. I figured out my macros, TDEE, etc. and got a great lifting routine, and got to work.  

I went from squatting the bar, to squatting 245lbs today. A new PR :).  

To celebrate, I decided to take a pic from my beginning and re-create it to see if I've changed much...Now that I'm 197lbs.  

[Click For Pics!](http://i.imgur.com/VfrIGLx.jpg)  

I'm here to say that if you WANT it, you can HAVE it. 
It may not be the most drastic change EVER, maybe not even inspirational, but I've been through a journey, going from 1,200 cals a day to 3,700 - 4,000 cals a day. I started eating until I puked, and then started eating more &amp; more. I lifted until I couldn't take anymore, and had to sit on the floor in a corner of the gym for a half hour, hoping I can run to the bathroom if I had to puke (I made it most of the time.)  

If any of you have any questions at all, please let me know, and I will answer when I can.  

Thank you!

My final goal is to put on towards 19kg/40lbs to move into the 11.5stone/73kg/160lbs weight area.  
I am 5foot10 for reference.  
  
A little bit of back story; I've been very underweight for most of my teen life and got incredibly fed up of it in my first year at university. Found gainit before coming back for second year and swore to join the gym and eat more than I ever had before.   
So [this was me](http://imgur.com/a/8zDI7) at 53kg/116lbs.   

I had a 26 inch waist with hips and ribs that stuck out like a corpses.
  
  
Since that day I have been going to the gym three times a week and eating around 3000-3500 calories a day.
This has caused me to put on 6kg/13lbs in about 2 months. [ME NOW](http://imgur.com/a/uJUZ7) at 59.55kg/131lbs with a 30 inch waist.  
  

My workout regime is an adaptation of starting strength and strong lifts plus a few other things I had come across in my research.  

**Day A**  
Deadlift 5x5   
Pullups/Chinups  
Military press 5x5  
Squat 4x8  

**Day B**  
Deadlift 5x5  
Barbell rows 5x5  
Bench press 5x5  
Squat 4x8  

It's three workouts a week (ABA, BAB, ABA so on) and I try to add another 2.5kg/5.5lbs onto  lifts each week.  

So far my lifts have increased like this:  

**Deadlift**  
 60kg/132lbs - 80kg/187lbs  
**Military Press**  
35kg/77lbs - 45kg/99lbs  
**Barbell rows**   
45kg/99lbs - 60kg/143lbs  
**Bench Press**  
 45kg/99lbs - 62.5kg/143lbs  
**Squat**   
55kg/121lbs - 80kg/176lbs  

**My diet on an average day**  
Breakfast - 4 large scrambled eggs on 4 slices of wholemeal bread  
Lunch - A few thickly spread peanut butter sandwiches  
Dinner - Large portion of Chicken, rice/pasta with vegetables, beans and garlic bread  
Each meal is accompanied with a pint of full fat milk and I will drink another if I feel hungry throughout the day    
Snacks - Fruit, nuts, cakes and general snacky foods not things like crisps or chocolate though, I try to keep it healthy(ish).  

**EDIT: Found some pictures from week 3 and 5, added them to a comparison with week 0 and 8** [PIC LINK](http://i.imgur.com/O8b9n.jpg)  
And based on what has been said I've reduced deadlifting to once a week but may increase it to twice a week if gains slow in either bodyweight or the 2.5kg weekly add-on progression.

So I decided its time I made a progress thread. 
I have been tall and skinny and I had enough of people calling me a Stick my entire life.
Here are the results from 1 year of training:

**Before**: http://i.imgur.com/kgvPlns.jpg  

**After**: http://i.imgur.com/3554pqx.jpg  

My current schedule is this:
Monday: Chest/Triceps
Tuesday: Back/Biceps
Wednesday: Rest
Thursday: Shoulders
Friday: Legs
Saturday: Rest
Sunday: Rest  

**Workout Program**:

I do hypertrophy based training and do not go below 6 reps on my sets as it worked best for me. I personally never tried SS, 5X5 and stuck to regular workouts of 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps for each exercise.

Here is my split('|' signifies superset):

**Chest/Triceps**: Incline Presses|Incline Flyes, Flat bench press|Flat Bench Flyes, Parallel Bar Dips,  Overhead Tricep extensions, SkullCrushers, Rope Pushdowns

**Back/Biceps**: Pullups, T-Bar Rows, Single-Arm Dumbbell Rows, Close Grip Pulldowns, Barbell Curls, Preacher Curls, Hammer Curls

**Shoulders**: Military Press, Dumbbell Presses, Lateral Raises, Front Raises, Shrugs

**Legs**: Bodyweight Squats*100, Heavy Squats, Leg Presses, Barbell Lunges, Barbell Calf raises.  


Main compound Lifts:  
Bench: 175 for good 8 reps  
Squats: 225 for 7-8 reps(going parallel)  
Deadlifts: ~200lbs for 6 reps  

**Nutrition**: Most important factor which helped me grow was my 3.5-4k Calories Diet. I'm a vegetarian but I started eating eggs to get some extra protein. A lot of my calories while bulking came Protein shake containing 2 scoops of Whey Protein, 1 cup of Oats, 1Tbsp Honey, 1Tbsp PB, ~600ml Milk.

Anyways, thanks for reading and let me know how's the progress :)

[Progress pic](http://imgur.com/i302q)

The first picture is actually more than six months ago but I was at that point six months before the ""after"" photo.
I went from 135 pounds to 160 pounds in weight. I increased my bench press by 85 pounds. I went from doing 5 pull ups to 10 with a +35 pound belt. My row increased significantly although I don't know how much. For lower body I mostly do machine hack squats (unfortunately) do to an old injury in highschool that required surgery so I mainly focus on higher reps with lower body. As for core I can now do 25 decline situps while holding 50 pounds at my head.

**I had tried working out before but it never really worked, but this year I decided to try everything without skipping once, before i gave up for good. I didn't realize how important consistency was until now, it has blown my mind.**

Here is what I did.

-High weights low reps. Sometimes pyrimids. If I ever did more than 10 reps I increased the weight.

-Pre-workout: N O Explode

-Post workout: Gold Standard Whey from Optimum Nutrition

-Worked out only 3 times a week (full body)

-Inspiration from Fitit/Gainit

-Fitocracy.com

Upperbody: Pullups, bench press, incline bench press, shoulder press, rows

Lowerbody: Machine hack squat, running, calf machine

He throws about 180KG on it and does about 10 reps with awesome form. I was really impressed. I hurt my back about a week and a bit ago doing squats, my flexibility sucks so I forward lean too much. This event led me to stretching daily + foam rolling (it's awesome, do it). I'm slowly increasing my flexibility but right now I'm just above parallel without my back rounding, so still stretching and staying off squats until I get it to parallel without rounding. Anyway, I was doing my deadlift and albeit it wasn't much weight (75KG) he complimented my form and asked what routine I was doing. I replied Starting Strength and he had not heard of it so I explained to him what it was. He agreed the routine was great and said at my size and when you are first starting try not to train more than 2/3 days a week. The guy had his head screwed on training-wise. It was awesome.

Hey guys! figured I would do a post here since I just recently become serious about lifting. I started January 1st of this year and did Shortcut to Size (google, author is jim stoppani) followed by actual dieting.

Before I started lifting I had fuckarounditis for a majority of the time in the gym. (been in and out of the gym since freshman year of highschool, a.k.a first picture) I did starting strength like most of the people who waltz over to /r/fitness for the first time but I was not satisfied with the physical gains I was seeing. Thus the switch to a hypertrophy centered program. Anyways heres the album.

The first picture is freshman year of HS without EVER lifting before. Than the following two is a bit of lifting (still pre-jan 1st). And the last three are current. I tried to get a lat picture on the last pic but was a bit awkward without someone taking it for me. Sorry about no legs, they are a little under average compared to the rest of my body, nothing to be proud of/look at.

I followed a pretty intense bulk for the first month of 4000 calories and saw myself basically explode with weight. Then it slowed down, and I began to feel as if I stopped gaining so I now eat 5000 calories a day and sometimes 6000. As for what I eat? I eat anything I can at all. Literally just everything.

I eat pb&amp;j in the morning. then a cliff builders bar 2-3 hours later. Then I get a full italian combo at panera bread (work there full time) with baguette side. Then another bar before workout. Then post workout I eat the rest of the sandwich. And for dinner I eat 1/2 lb of whole grain/wheat spaghetti with tomato sauce. And Ill throw in random junk food through-out the day. I.E I was eating a bowl of ice cream before bed for a while to help with calories. And this last 2 weeks I drank about a 1/2 gal of whole milk a day to go from 160-167.

Hope I didn't leave out any other info haha sorry for wall of text.

Tl;DR 4 months 139-167lbs. Eat 4-5000 calories a day. Lift 4-5 days a week.

Just want to say now if it wasn't for you sexy and intelligent mofos and the motivation you gave me I wouldn't be where I am right now so for that, you are awesome and I am very grateful.

OK so without further ado:

[The before/after pic.](http://imgur.com/wx4A42Z) Yea I know it doesn't look like much at all, but in person there is a very noticeable difference, I've been told by fam, friends and co-workers that I actually start to fill out the clothing that I wear. The before photo was taken at the beginning of February and the after was taken last night (May 9th).


**Diet:** For a good month (pre 'before' photo) before I got off my ass and got a membership, I out of nowhere started eating like a champ. After I started working out for a while I started to loose that feeling of 'always hungry' and ate a little less, I still eat a little less and struggle meeting my nutritional goals but I'm trying to improve on that, a mans gotta EAT! my meals were/still are (not so much as before) a little like this.

*Breakfast*

* 4 eggs
* 4 slices of bacon
* Greek yogurt
* 2 cups whole milk, sometimes 3
* avocado

  
*Lunch*

* Brown rice
* chicken breast
* 2 cups whole milk
* greek yogurt
* whatever snacking I can get at the cafeteria at my work

*Dinner*

* Honestly I never made/make my own dinners, it was/is always good 'ol mommas cooking and whatever was available at work (during afternoon shift) and that could be anything from fish n chips, grilled steak, butter chicken, mashed taters/veggies and some type of meat (salmon, chicken, pork, whatever..) what have you.
* fucking whole milk

*Snacking/shakes*

* Protein bars
* Post workout shake: 2 scoops Mutant Mass, 1.5 scoops Whey brotein, table spoon Creatine all mixed in a lot of water otherwise that shit is like drinking pancake batter.
* Mass gainer shake twice a day (half serving each time, so two scoops twice a day)
* Whole milk
* I occasionally go for Pho on the weekends, I don't know how nutritional that really is but its fucking delicious and I would die happy if I somehow drowned in a pool of it.
* just stuff I find

**Routine:**

For the first two months I would work out 3 x week, doing SL 5x5 and had some pretty nice strength gains, I logged everything on my phone which fucking shattered a couple weeks ago cause of my drunk ass (oh ya, I typically drink friday and or saturday nights, and its usually rum so I have pop to chase it with - the ONLY time I drink that crap) so I can't give you exact numbers unfortunately. 

I got really bored of doing SL and seen very, very small size gains so a month ago I started [Jim Stoppani's 'Shortcut To Size'](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/shortcut-to-size-training.html) and made some awesome progress strength AND size wise. The after pic is only the first month out of 3 so I'm excited to see where I'm at by the end. When the 3 months of that are over I'm probably going to do SL again for a month or two for some more strength, then start another strength/size fusion routine.

Here are the last sets/reps/weight of the following lifts I've done:

* DL: 3 sets, 7 reps @ 145lbs. 10 reps on 4th set.
* Squat: 4 sets, 7-8 reps @ 110lbs. 
* Bench: 4 sets, 5 reps @ 95.

I've never tried to see what my 1RM is so I can't provide that info, sorry.

Anyways that's it folks, I guess. It's been a wonderful ride so far and I'm super stoked to see where I end up in the future. Again thanks so much, this is my favorite subreddit, the members and mods uphold a certain caliber that isn't existent in a lot of other subs. I'm going to do another one of these when I finish the S2S program. If you've got any questions or want to like, I dunno, compliment me and make my feel warm and fuzzy inside then go right ahead :)

Background: Started lifting 3 years ago, have had 2 non lifting related injuries inbetween. Started at 145lbs before I picked up any weights. 

Started my official bulk in mid-December. I've always considered myself a ""hard gainer"" but quickly realized that it was all in my head and that I just was not eating above my maintenance consistently. 10-15 lbs was my target and I am definitely satisfied! 
I first started taking Serious Mass (finished 2 bags overall, taking 1 scoop per day) and quickly gained 10 lbs by Mid-January (168-170lbs). 
I track my calories on the myfitnesspal App and that has been the greatest thing ever! I haven't skipped one meal yet, eating in everyday at over 3300 calories. No snack was left uneaten, it was what some may call a dirty bulk. My macros were set at about 200g protein, 200g fat, 200g carbs .
I was a long time SS lifter and I switched to Lane Norton's PHAT when I started my bulk. ALL of my lifts went up a considerable amount. I did 5 day splits (with some additional rest days in-between). Today, 3/15, I weigh in at 175lbs pretty consistently. And I will be cutting in the next 2 weeks! 

Squat went from 305 to 350 (x5). Bench went from 175 to 200 (x3). Incline DB Press went from 70 to 85lbs (x8).

.
.

I gained most of my weight through dirty bulking.  

I have faithfully consumed an average of 2 Costco blueberry muffins a day over a span of five months.  Two of those muffins together is 1220 calories.  

I start each day with 3 scoops of muscle milk and end it with 3 scoops of muscle milk.  That totals in 900 calories.  

Before I go to bed every night I eat a can of chili worth 540 calories.  

I eat a normal meal at 5:00 pm that usually has between 800-1200 calories.  

I snack a bit too on things like nuts and fruit.  

Overall I usually consume 3,500-4,000 calories a day.  

I go through a tub a muscle milk a week ($32 at Costco).  I go through slightly more than a dozen Costco blueberry muffins a week ($7 a dozen at Costco).  I go through 7 cans a chili a week ($6.75 at my local grocery store).  For my one real meal I spend anywhere between $5-$10 a day.

I hired a personal trainer and for 3 months and all I did was a lot of cable weights and used the hammer press machine with some success (I actually got a thicker shoulder, chest and back from it; my shirts fit better).  This last month I fired the trainer and all I've been doing is barbells a la the Starting Strength book by Mark Rippetoe.

I look forward to gaining another 30 lbs, and then another 30lbs and being swole as fuck.

A little background on me- I'm 28, female, 5'8"" and have been trying to bulk for the past year. I have only recently (since January) been clear on how to bulk so my progress was kind of slow for a while. As I said, my gym just completed a six week Meltdown Challenge where those participating were measured with a Bod Pod at the beginning and end of the six weeks. We all focused on doing a strict paleo diet, which means nothing processed, no grains, legumes, gluten, dairy, caffeine, alcohol, or refined sugars. Basically, I ate a lot of meat, veggies, fruits, eggs, oils, and nuts.

My TDEE averaged between 2200-2400 calories (jumping up to 2700-3000 on heavy workout days). 

My average daily meal looked something like this:

* Pre-AM Workout: ~12 almonds
* Post-Workout: Smoothie/Shake- 1/3 cup full fat coconut milk, 1 cup blueberries, 1 banana, splash orange juice, handful spinach, 1 scoop Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Isolate
* Breakfast: 2-3 eggs, 3 slices bacon/sausage links, 1 cup sweet potatoes
* Snack: Handful of nuts, paleo banana muffin
* Lunch: 3-4 oz. meat, 1-2 cup veggie, 1 apple
* Snack: 1 hard boiled egg, 1/2 cup nuts/dried fruit mix, 1 orange
* Dinner: 5-6 oz. meat, 2 cups veggie
* Occasional calorie make-up smoothie before bed

My weekly workouts went something like this (note: I was training for a half-marathon that fell in week 5 so I went a little light on the weight lifting in weeks 4-6 and completely skipped out on Jiu Jitsu Open Mat on Saturdays to do long runs).

* Monday: AM- Crossfit-like class, PM- Bootcamp, Jiu Jitsu technique
* Tuesday: AM- Lifting (Starting Strength: Squats, Press, Power Cleans, Dips, Weighted Hyper Extensions, Weighted Sit-ups), PM- Run 3-4 miles, Bootcamp
* Wednesday: PM- Bootcamp, Jiu Jitsu Technique
* Thursday: AM- Lifting (SS: Squats, Bench Press, Dead Lifts, Pull-ups, Weighted Hyper Extensions, Weighted Sit-ups), PM- Run 3-4 miles
* Friday: AM- Crossfit-like class
* Saturday: Long run (building 8-12 miles) / Half Marathon
* Sunday: Rest

When I joined my gym last March, I weighed 108 lbs. By December, I was up to 112 lbs. Here are my numbers from early April to now.

Bod Pod Numbers (Before/After):

* Weight: 115 lbs / 116.7 lbs
* Fat: 23.5% (27 lbs) / 21.7% (25.3 lbs)
* Lean: 76.5% (88 lbs) / 78.3% (91.4 lbs)
* Body Fat Rating: Moderately Lean / LEAN

Let me break this down for you... that means I lost 1.8 lbs of FAT and had 3.4 lbs of LEAN MASS GAIN. Insert high kick/fist pump- YEAH!

Measurements:

* Chest: 32.5"" / 32.5""
* Waist: 30"" / 27"" 
* Hips: 37"" / 37""
* Thighs: 19.5"" / 20.5""
* Arms: 10"" / 10.5""

Lifts:

* Dead Lift: 90 lbs (1x5) / 115 lbs (1x5) -- THAT'S BODY WEIGHT, YO!!!
* Squat: 85 lbs (7x3) / 95 lbs (5x5)
* Bench Press: 55 lbs (3x5) / 70 lbs (3x5)
* Overhead Press: 45 lbs (bar, 1x5- barely) / 45 lbs (bar, 3x5, solidly)
* Power Clean: 55 lbs (3x5) / 65 lbs (3x5)

Average Mile (5K pace): 9:31 / 8:52 (measured at week 3 of Meltdown)

[Before/After](http://imgur.com/a/DHLZa) pics (both sets taken in the morning before eating).  As you can kind of tell, I have slight scoliosis so I find it funny to look at the left side of my body (core mostly) and see how much more developed it is. And, just a side note on the paleo diet and why it works for me, I am lactose intolerant and have a slight gluten intolerance. Because of this diet, I am a lot less bloated and miserable, in general, which you can really see in my side pictures.

* Some progression is not as fast as I'd like but I'm happy with weight gains, taking into consideration missing so much gym time. Hopefully posting this will get me the drive to get back to a long term routine again.

A couple of months ago I was reading one such success story and the guy wrote some joke about the ""special snowflake syndrome"". That one cracked me up and really hit home. I realized I've been going with the 'high metabolism' narrative for such a long time it was impeding me. 


The very next day I got to eating, and I meant eating a lot. I was doing about 4 full meals a day. 

I was a fit but somewhat skinny guy ~75kg. By addressing my special snowflake syndrome, I managed to go up to 81kg while maintaining my exercises (I mostly play kick boxing as well as squash and football). I was bulking up gradually and people around me noticed. 

Now I know this isn't the ideal way to do it and not the most efficient, but for me overcoming that very first obstacle, eating, changed everything else for me. If you were a special snowflake, shut up and finish your big lunch, you have at least 2 more meals to go!

You should be competing in the gym but, more importantly with a fork. This is what I have learnt about the latter part. 

**#1 if you dont own tupperware, buy some now**: I cant stress this enough. Owning a huge set of tupper ware will make you having the right amount of food in you at all times just so much easier. Sandwiches and ziplockable food will only get you so far. Walmart has a set of rubbermaid red ones that stack. buy two of the bigger boxes and ur set for 25$ (14$ when they go on sale for two!)

**#2 Rice cookers are bliss**: Another huge game changed for me was buying one of those 10$ rice cookers. Nothing has been able to give me so many complex carbs like brown rice has. I can easily eat a 100 grams dry which is about 350-375 calories prepared. I make it with rice, dash of salt, two dashes of chicken powder and a teaspoon of worcester sauce. Accompany that to a big plate of chicken or steak and youre right around 1000 calories in one meal that is delicious!

**#3 Ziplock your portions**: When I go shopping for food, I spend about an hour at home measuring out my chicken, beef, pasta and rice into ziplock bags. Why bother? Because a meal is a 5 minutes ordeal once I have everything measured up in ziplock bags and ready to go. Not to mention it defrosts super quick also. I do this with everything! Call it OCD but being able to mindlessly put together a meal will be the difference between you eating 3K call 7 days a week and doing it only 3-4 days a week. 

**#4 When in doubt stuff it down your mouth**: I hear so much talk about macros and other crap. The honnest truth is this; does it really matter for the average skinny guy? No I mean seriously as long as you arent a moron eating a bag of chips then having that mccain deep and delicious right after and thinking wow I got my cal on there just shut up and eat it. Good/complex carbs + meats + fish there is no other secret!

**#5 Use a spoon and use it fast**: Call it mental but damn its so much easier to eat with a damn spoon if you want fill your face as hard and as fast as you can. Why do I say as fast as you can? This is a timing game! The quick you chew and pound the food down, the less your body has time to react to you being full. Dont overdo do this. Eat fast and hard and when you feel full, take a few more and back off. Dont over bloat. Itll just hurt your next meal. 

**#6 use supplements as rewards not a base**: I never ever allowed myself to relly on supplements to make up calories or help me perform better. I saw these as a reward, a gift to myself for taking care of the two basic needs: training and eating right. Gained 5 lbs from whole food? Allowed myself to take shakes and multi-vitamins. Got to 15 lbs? Took some weight gainer. Next goal is 145 when I will start a cycle of Creatine. Motivation is very simple. It comes from change and FUN! Being able to add in a quick weight gain or power gain in the gym everytime just makes me that much more motivated. I have seen others go on BB.com and spend 150$ on supplements, spend a month in the gym, reach their ""bro plateau"" and give up. For me it was the opposite, end of reward cycle I could always look forward to the next one. I honnestly cant wait to get on Creatine when I hit 145 and hit my ultimate goal of 155.

I think thats a few of the basic things to know. This is info that most people learn going in by no means is your one stop guide. I could sit here and write all about what foods to eat, how much to eat a day how often, gomad and all that other crap but thats not the point. The point here is to make all those things actually happen for you by using tricks I found work for me! 

PS: how do I get those cool green name tags lol?

I want to take this opportunity to share my progress with y'all!  I am going through a really rough breakup and having a tough time, so I thought maybe showing off my progress would help me feel a little better.  So, the back story goes like this: I enter college (age 18) as a very thin, 145-pound, 5'9 out-of-shape young man.  After first semester, my friends motivate me to get off the video games and get into the gym.  Slowly but surely, I become more and more serious about my lifting, and eventually end up where I am now (age 21), built a little better, at 175 pounds.

I'll start with my age 18 album: http://imgur.com/a/HuRHM
I'll apologize that I don't have any good posing pics, but I had not even heard of Reddit when I started lifting.  Ignore the weird tattoos in some of those pictures...I don't even know how to explain that.  I started working out in January 2011 with some college buddies, hitting the gym 5 days a week, using body splits like Chest/Tri, Back/Bi, Shoulder/Abs, and really not doing any cardio beyond pick-up basketball.  My starting numbers looked like this:
Bench: 95 lb x 4 reps - 
Squat: 185 lb x 8 reps - 
DL: 135 lb x 3 reps - 
OHP: never worked in until later in my workout career.


After a few months of progress I plateaued and decided it was time to get serious.  I found Gainit and started reading through the FAQ, learning about calories/protein, real workouts, etc. etc.  I decided to do GOMAD for the summer of 2011 while doing my own take on the PHAT program.  After completing GOMAD, I made sure I drank a gallon of water a day, started drinking a protein shake a day (Optimum Nutrition was the best value for $$) and counting calories/protein daily.  Through my sophomore year of school I kept making sure I was hitting 2600 calories a day through any means necessary, around 150 grams of protein, pushing myself every workout and getting some cardio work through pickup basketball.

Summer came around again (2012) and I went through GOMAD once more, pushed my weight up to 182-ish and continued working out.  When I got back to school for fall semester, however, I was hit with an opportunity to become a co-ed cheerleader at my university and get access to the varsity gym + strength coaches.  This changed my workout style, focusing WAY more on squats, OHP, and overall base + core strength.  I was a cheerleader for a semester, then went back to PHAT and continuing my calories/protein.  When I started dating at the end of fall semester, being the 400m track runner at my school, I started working in cardio heavily, eating a lot healthier and cutting back some of my gainz.  I did not lose any strength, and today I sit at 175 pounds.  I'm really struggling to eat today, but I know you guys here will keep me motivated through this rough time in my life.  I could not have made this progress without Gainit, so I want to thank all of you for helping me improve my body, myself, my confidence, and land me in opportunities I never would have had without you.  Thank y'all, for real.

Here's my current album: http://imgur.com/a/YyQny
Current numbers:
Bench: 245 lb x 4 - 
Squat: 405 lb x 4 -

Never thought I'd be doing this, but I'm proud to finally have overcome skeleton mode. Decided 7 months ago that change was needed, started lifting and eating like a horse. Progress was slow at first but has really picked up now that I've been focusing on my diet a lot more. No junk food, whole foods only, water all day...

I'm planning on continuing to bulk to around 180lbs (I'm 6'1 btw). At around 3500+ calories a day, this goal doesn't seem to be as unrealistic as it used to. 

To anyone struggling to gain weight, don't stop trying. I convinced myself years ago that I'd be stuck at that weight forever. Anyone can make the change, just KEEP EATING. 

EDIT: A typical diet day for me would go something like this (note: I'm living on a campus so I have to live with whatever the dining hall provides me and some outside foods):

With all meals I have 2-3 glasses of water and 1 glass of whole milk
Breakfast: 2 large bowls of oatmeal and assorted fruit/yogurt smoothie (1 glass)
Lunch: Varies according to whatever is being served, but I eat only chicken/rice/beef/whole wheat pastas, normally two servings/plates. Sometimes I also eat a bowl of egg salad or tuna with mayo. One large bowl of spinach salad, just straight spinach and carrots. 
Dinner: Same situation as lunch, two servings of whatever is being served (example: grilled chicken breasts, turkey, mashed potatoes, pulled pork) along with another assorted fruit/yogurt smoothie.(1 glass)
Post-workout meal: Grilled chicken breast sandwich on whole wheat with lettuce/mayo.
Night snack: Large bowl of oatmeal with whole milk 

Basically I eat a lot of oats whenever I feel hungry at all between meals. 

Also, 8 hours of sleep every night!! This was key, I noticed my energy and overall attitude improved significantly when I really started focusing in on diet and making sure to sleep 8 hours a night.

I manage this on $40/week, or just under $6 per day, which is what I imagine piqued a lot of people's interest. I feel like I need to provide a bit of a disclaimer with this, though.

I also had to spend about $100 the first week I started this meal plan, to get things that last a long time (like peanut butter, oats, protein powder, etc.)

So, I have two ""days"" planned out. I'll typically pick one of those ""days"" to be my meals for the week. The meals can be flip-flopped between either day, since they balance out decently.

I'm not an expert at all, but this is what seems to be working for me. I try to make what I have work.

Decided to start lifting up weights and working out. To be honest I have not been consistent these past 6-7 months and this is only a fraction of what I could have had. Most of the time I was too lazy to go to the gym or just didn't hit my caloric goals. Doing Computer Science at a major at college does not help either, huge workload. I would usually get very motivated for a month or two and then stop for a month or two then go back at it. It was an endless cycle. As a result my gains suffered but the past two months my diet has been spot on and I have been going to the gym 3 days a week and do not plan on stopping. It's just a matter of saying fuck it and doing it. I know these aren't amazing results but for me putting them together made me feel a lot happier about myself. I've had my fair set of injuries along the way with bad squat/deadlift form and to be honest my weights aren't even that impressive I bench 50kg 5x5, squat 65kg 5x5 and deadlift 70kg 1x5 and can do about 5 pull-ups and 10 chin-ups so nothing amazing but I'm hoping to improve that over the next year. I have been doing Stronglifts on and off in the time and have went from not being able to bench to bar to almost benching my bodyweight. I eat 3000cal a day (mostly drink a lot of milk).

Read at your desire.

The only reason I'm writing this is because I see posts every day about people who are struggling to eat even 2500kcal a day. To those people i offer my story.

I always loved being active ever since i was young. I would always be the most athletic of my peers and I was very competitive and loved racing other kids ever since i found out how good i was/am at sprinting. I was pretty much the fit kid in the grade.


One day my parents told me we were moving to a Brazil and thats when it pretty much went downhill. Now you might not know this but Brazilian cuisine is delicious so i was well fed, however, with a lack of organized sporting leagues/activities i slowly became less fit. I had lost a lot of my athleticism but, fortunately, had not gainied any weight. 

When we moved back to the States this weakened body of mine didn't really need need to consume large amounts of food in order to function. Yes, i was in puberty and i ate more than before, but people would always comment on how little i ate and how weak and skinny i looked. This progressed until around 8th grade. By then i had regained much of my athleticism and I was once again one of the fastest sprinters (very useful for soccer). The one thing i did lack though, was appetite. I could easily function with 1500-2000kcal a day. I hovered at around 120lbs at 5'9 for a good 2 years.

Then came the summer after my freshman year when i decided i was going to put on weight. I signed up for a membership at my local YMCA and lifted and did whatever exercises were available and actually did quite good for myself gaining 10lbs. I was still eating quite terribly, however, and i felt so fatigued after workouts that i became unmotivated. I lost the weight i had gained and i actually got to the lowest weight/bmi in my life. 120lbs at 5'11"".

The moment that i think changed my life was when one of my friends wanted to workout with me. It just gave me the motivation not to pussy out. I started lifting 3x/week and forced myself to eat. At first i resorted to a 1100kcal shake that i drank with my meals but even then i would often skip lunch or dinner as i wasn't hungry enough to eat. I was averaging about 2000kcal a day. Then i learned about r/gainitmeals and i made myself the monster breakfast. I left out the 4 pieces of toast and omitted one egg and even then I was barely able to eat it. I forced myself to eat 3 MEALS (not snacks) a day even if they weren't large portions. I even had to cut my shake because i wasn't going to sacrfice a meal for a shake. Within a month of stretching and abusing my stomach i could eat 3000kcal a day with some effort. Within the next month i was making monster lunches and dinners barely eeking them out, at points nearly puking an entire stomach full. I'm proud to tell you that 2 months after starting my eating journey I'm able to eat 4000kcal of just meal with an extra 1100kcal shake ontop of it with less effort than i thought would ever be possible. Keep in mind this is without any mass-gainer supplement. This is NOT dirty bulking and I don't take ANY supplements other than protein.

I also smoke which I know is bad. What's everyone's opinion or experience? Particularly if you were a skinny ectomorph like me.

**""**Currently out in theaters is Pain &amp; Gain, an action-crime film that features part-time WWE Superstar The Rock in the role of a born-again Christian, sober ex-con who gets caught up in an extortion ring and a kidnapping scheme that goes “terribly wrong.” For the role of a massive, sadistic bodybuilder, the multi-time wrestling champion added twelve to fifteen pounds of muscle to push his 6-foot-4 frame to over 250 pounds.

Courtesy of USA Today, here is an approximation of Johnson’s seven-meals-a-day diet plan, which combined with an intensive workout regime, he followed for sixteen weeks to prepare for the role, as well as to maintain his sizable look through the filming process.

**Meal one**: ten-ounce beef fillet, two cups of oatmeal, two-egg omelet.

**Meal two**: eight ounces of cod, twelve ounces of sweet potatoes, one cup of steamed vegetables (onions, peppers, mushrooms).

**Meal three**: eight ounces of chicken, two cups of white rice, one cup of vegetables.

**Meal four**: eight ounces of cod, two cups of rice, one cup of vegetables.

**Meal five**: eight ounces of steak, twelve ounces of baked potato fries, one salad.

**Meal six**: ten ounces of cod, two more cups of rice, one salad.

**Meal seven**: thirty grams of casein protein powder, ten-egg-white omelet, one cup of vegetables, one tablespoon of Omega-3 fish oil.

Regarding the diet, Johnson noted, “There’s a right way and a wrong way to bulk up for a film. The wrong way is to eat as much garbage as you can for weeks on end, which actors have the tendency of doing. It’s unhealthy and puts an incredible amount of stress on your body, joints, tendons and digestive system. The right way is to bulk up with good complex carbs and protein/fat sources.”

Though Johnson portrays a drug-fueled character, the actor/wrestler insists he did not utilize steroids to achieve his hulking physique for the role.**""**

Today I'd like to compile a list of my favorite recipes that I've taken from those posts, as well as a few I've developed on my own. If you've got others you liked, stick them in the comments! I'd love to come out of this with a number of delicious and easy ways to get through the day on 3500+ calories. 

***SHAKES:***

**1/2 Whole Svunt Variant**

* 1 	cup whole milk

* 1 	cup half and half

* 1 cup oats

* 1 tsp honey

* 1/4 cup natural peanut butter

* 64 	grams Whey Protein

* 2 	bananas

1659 calories, 95g protein.

**Lesser Svunt**

* 1/2 cup oats

* 1 1/2 cup whole milk

* 1 banana

* 2 tb peanut butter

* 2 tb Nutella

* 2 scoops whey protein

1048 calories, 63g protein.
I find the full Svunt recipe incredibly difficult to get down sometimes, so I started doing this instead. Only 600 cal less, which I'm much happier making up later. Start with 3 eggs and bacon (about 300 cal) and take the shake with you for a great start. 

**Krasian's Shake**

from user Krasian.

* Whole Milk

* 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream

* .5lb Peanut butter Half a bar of 80% cocoa dark chocolate

* Squeeze of honey

* 2 bananas

* .5 cup greek yogurt

* oats

* cinnamon

* nutmeg for taste

* Berries if I have them

Usually about 2500-3000 calories. Goddamn. 

*In addition,* Kombat_Wombat says that vanilla protein with orange gatorade tastes like a creamsicle. I tried it with ice as a shake, it ruled. MudvayneMW recommends mixing cold black coffee with your crappy chocolate protein powder. 

***MEALS:***

from **Raymond8505, Goulash**

* 3lbs stew meat chopped into large chunks

* 3lbs potatoes chopped into large chunks

* 2 boullion cubes

* 325g frozen peas and carrots

* 28oz can of peeled tomatoes

* half bottle wine

* salt &amp; pepper

let simmer 2-3 hours til most liquid is gone. Raymond8505 usually has a pint of milk and a pint of OJ with it. makes 4 super dense servings, 1200cal, 90g protein / serving. I prefer it with corn and eggplant, personally, to the peas and carrots. Just chop up the eggplant and toss it in a pot with a few tb of olive oil for a few minutes before browning the beef. 


**Sweet Potato Waffles**

* 1 small yam - microwave til soft

* 2 tb butter

* 1 c whole milk

* 3 eggs

* grated citrus zest

* 2 tb brown sugar

* 1/2 tsp cinnamon

* 2 tsp baking powder

* 1c flour

* 1c oats

1450 calories, 52g protein. 

Its a lot to eat, so sometimes I'll save a couple waffles and make a sandwich on them for lunch. And that's all I've got for now.

EDIT: Thanks guys!
For my diet, I wish I could tell you exactly what I ate but it was basically anything I wanted.. For breakfast I would eat a PB and J with a couple of eggs and a glass of milk. I would always make sure to have a midmorning snack such as a granola bar, something high in protein. For lunch I eat out. It would either be fried chicken with mashed potatoes and some kind of greens. Or chicken fried steak, or fried chicken. Once a week I would get a baked potato with a chopped beef sandwich. I wouldn't ever be able to eat all of my food, so I would save some protein and carbs for a little preworkout meal. I drank creatine and Karbolyn preworkout. I drink Universal Torrent for a postworkout shake(High quality protein, contains carbs, amino acids, and creatine). My mom would always have some kind of home cooked meal for dinner. Some kind of meat, with a couple sides. Then I would make my nightly shake before bed which is 2 scoops of Universal Real gains(1/2 a serving. Also, I'm not using mass gainer after I finish this bag. Going to switch to all natural foods), half a cup of blended oats, half a banana, a LOT of peanut butter, and whole milk. Towards the end I started taking daily vitamins and fish oil. I also took some kind of ZMA or sleeping supplement for part of the time. Wish I could be more specific guys, sorry!

Here lately I haven't been making gains so I decided to try [this diet that another Redditor posted on here. ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNctsEFp7Zs) Seems like a pretty solid diet for cheap. I started it yesterday.

For my workout plan I do a four day split. Chest and tris, back and bis, Legs, and then shoulders combined with another muscle group that was lacking. For awhile there I was doing chest and legs twice a week just because I love the gym. I'm usually in there 2-3 hours but that's too long so I decided to cut it back a little bit. I also do core training every other day. As far as weight goes, I just push my self as hard as I possibly can while maintaining form. For some numbers, my squat started at repping 135 with difficulty. My 3RM is now 315. Bench I started pressing 35 or 40lb dumbbells, now I rep 85s for my last set. I can get more in depth with this if you guys would like but I'm at work right now.
Here are a couple of progress pics I took yesterday, weighing in at 155 this morning. These pics are 2 months apart but I haven't gained any size because of my diet.

Hello /r/gainit

Thanks for your patience.  Home and work crisises prevented me from getting this information to you sooner.

**Summary**

Our community, or the ones that respond to surveys at least, is relatively homogeneous.  The community is primarily males that are 18 to 25 that are in school with a gym membership that don't have a food allergy or food restriction.

**Analysis**

As most of you probably expected, we are mostly skinny, college-aged males.  I was a little surprised at how low the percentage of food allergies and restrictions is based on how many posts we have about it.  At ~2% of the community, we have fewer females that I expected.

I expect that with our community as it is that we have some folks who are better at analyzing data than I am.  Unless anyone objects, I plan on making the raw data available so that someone can make graphs/charts if there is a desire to do so.  Please let me know in the comments or by PM if you'd be interested.

I realized that I am not a strong choice for making surveys as many of you pointed out how poor my questions were.  I tried to make modifications as the survey went along but there was only so much salvaging I could do.  Also, I came to the painful realization that Survey Monkey is no longer completely free (as it was when I was in college) and through creative use of fine print made me pay to get my results.  So if you think it's worth creating another, more detailed survey, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll be canceling my membership late next week.

Finally, I included some of the responses I found entertaining in the details below.

**Intro:** I have been watching my figure since junior year of high school. Back then, I wanted to get a six pack but had the idea that it was all in the amount of cardio and crunches I would do. While it was not something that I worked diligently towards, it was something that was always in the back of my mind. I always thought that at 140-145 lb, I'd be at my goal.

ALSO, my best friend was my little brother who is 8 years younger than me.

**Around 155 lb:**
[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/QxN2m.jpg)

Fast forward to Freshmen year of college, and I was having the time of my life. Sleeping late, open cafeteria, away from parents. I ended up going up to about 180 due to nothing but 7-11, sugary drinks, and ice cream/pizza in bulk quantities. Furthermore, these late nights took a toll on my freshmen year GPA (1.1 cumulative for the first year). At this point, I got really concerned and started working out a lot. 1 hr of balls to the walls cardio (Elliptical, Track, anything where my heart rate would go over 180 -- not an exaggeration).

[Me at 180](http://i.imgur.com/kGxQ4.jpg)

When I was gaining and losing weight at this point, I noticed that I gained a hardened belly -- the kind of belly fat that accumulates due to poor eating habits. I noticed that it would lessen whenever I would use the bathroom, so I ended up switching over to nothing but fiber filled foods. Often times, I would have an urgency to use the bathroom but would not be able to. Enter laxatives.

As I'm typing this, I'm realizing how more and more obvious this seems: it seems as if at this point of my life, I felt like everything was going out of control and the easiest thing for me to control was my eating habits. I started counting the calories of what I ate, and seeing what vitamins they provided. I wanted to achieve maximum vitamins at the minimal cost of calories.

Summer 2008 I traveled to a ranch in Mexico. I couldn't count the calories in food, so I just ended up eating very little. Coming back to the US, I realized that I went down to 140. 

[At slightly above 135](http://imgur.com/5mD4j)

Since that belly of adipose tissue was still in place, I decided that maybe 135 would be the way to go.

2008-2009
Sophomore year since I no longer had the meal plan at school, my buddies and I took on the idea of eating on a budget, thus cheapest calorie+vitamin content was king. I ended up eating just an apple a day, a serving size of bran cereal (to ensure that my fiber was at 100% recommended daily value), and then just nibbled on whatever. I took a multivitamin to ensure that I was getting nutrients. I tried to run 3 miles one day. I sprinted a good quarter mile towards the end, when I suddenly blacked out. Although I was sure I was healthy, I stopped working out as a result. At nights, I would wake up because I felt my bones hurt or my legs and feet would cramp up. I had several problems at home (relatives dying, my best friend changing and me not being able to relate to him anymore).

[Before I knew it, I was 110 lb](http://i.imgur.com/k38wp.png)


I was constantly cold and moody. I went through a lot of stress due to my bad grades, which is when I was diagnosed anorexic, bulimic, and depressed. Now that I was able to see what I thought was a six pack, I decided to put on some weight. Luckily, a friend of mine was a huge weight lifter, so he gave me a simple routine. I still have my starting stats (which include the barbell/dumbbell weight)

Me @ 110 lb
Barbell Squat -- 100 lb
Barbell Bench -- 65 lb
Barbell Deadlift -- 80 lb
Overhead press -- 15 lb dumbbells
Pull-ups - 1
Curls - 20lb dumbbell
Dips - 5
Misc Abs

I started to eat more protein at this point -- took protein shakes and egg-white omelets. I figured that if I'm going to gain weight, I'm going to do it lean. Just like I wanted to get 100% of my daily fiber, I ended up trying to get 1 g protein / per lb. Once I hit 120 I would get scared of how fast I was gaining and see my ""visible six pack"" start to fade, and cut. This went on for a good 3 years. When I would see a hipster that was skinny fat, I wanted to get skinnier than them but be able to say that I'm strong than them.

I noticed that my attitude started taking a toll on my relationships with people. People would pull away or just want to hangout with me less. I was no longer attractive to girls, but still felt like I wanted to talk down to people.

My lifts around 120 lb were as follows:

Barbell Bench (quarter way) - 175lb
Quarter BB Squats - 185 lb
Rounded Back Deadlifts - 185lb
Military/Overhead press - 50 lb barbell
Pullups - 5
Curls/Tricept Extensions - 20lb

Around 2010, I stopped going to a psychologist as I saw myself going nowhere. At one point, I felt that I was happy enough to stop taking my medication so I did. Although this may not have been the best thing to do, I did alright without them. I'd have my bad days like everyone else but I had my good days as well. Furthermore, I was embarrassed to take them and didn't want a lifelong dependency on them.

During my last month in college, I ended up falling on cement (got tackled) and broke my wrist. This made me realize just how weak my body was, despite what I thought.

&gt;&gt; 2012

Now that I'm done with college, I've realized that my attitude was all wrong. I decided to try to get in shape (still lean, nonetheless) but being a bit less stringent.

[Yesterday -- September 08](http://i.imgur.com/Q8l5b.png)

(dat lighting)

I've decided to continue my eating habits of having everything as least processed as possible, but trying to have food from natural sources (with the exception of carbonated water).

I'm currently at around 135 lb, started to run again (but realized that I have flat feet -- this is something that I'm working on with a pair of shoes that have adequate arch support), and decided to go down in weight to ensure that I have good form.

I started working out with my younger brother since he's overweight. We swap out gear between exercises (I deadlift, he squats and vice versa) We made a pact that he would lose weight and I'd gain weight. Since we've been getting along again, it's definitely helped.

My current stats:

215 lb Squats (slightly below parallel)
205 lb Deadlifts (I need more weight and possibly gloves)
145 lb Benching (hits the chest)
Sets of 8 Pull/Chin ups (hands either way)
95 lb Bent over Rows
85 lb Standing Military Press
35 lb Dumbbell Lunges
35 lb Curls/Tricept Extensions
~8:30 minute miles (about 2+ every other day)

I know that I'm still at 135, but I feel that it's been a lot to deal with. Being in shape has definitely improved my mood, concentration and made me feel happier. My goal is 140-145 lb. Once there, I'm not quite sure where to go from there.

Sorry for the long read, but I figure that we need some motivation right here. 

**TL;DR**

Even if the (m)anorexia/emotional story doesn't apply, at least note how my lifts have gone up since I've gained said weight. Just eat well and lift for the sake of feeling better and not so much to impress other people.

I'm in a similar camp. I'm a small, skinny guy, trying to pack on a few pounds, but I haven't got much of an appetite.

My question is this: how many people have used smoking cannabis as a way to eat (and comfortably digest) more?

I am incredibly proud of these pictures.  My favorite part about them, is that most of the progress was made within two months.  From mid-January to mid-March I was doing P90X.  While I definitely saw some results, they weren't drastic.  I think I went from 137 to 140.

I joined a gym, began SS, and ate as much as I could.  I wish I had skipped P90X altogether.

I'm only a few pounds away from my goal weight, and I plan on bulking until July.  That will give me three months to lower my BF% before my wedding/honeymoon in October.

27 years old male, 6'3"", been swimming from the age of 6 to 12, than played soccer and basketball for about 6 years, after that I stopped to focus on my studies. Became skinnier and skinnier, always wanted to have a 6-pack without working out too much, so I just ate around 2000 kcals and did nothing all day.

Last year I started working out to overcome my mild depression, got my first girlfriend and some results at the gym who motivated me greatly.

I started with a split routine suggested by the personal trainer at my gym, which was crap, so I made a one my own after researching lots of information about strength training and bodybuilding.

Right now I'm focusing on compound lifts (Deadlifts, pull-ups, bench, dips, OHP), can't squat for shit since I found out recently I have anterior peltic tilt, I wondered why whenever I tried squatting I fell backward before even reaching parallel, so I just did it on the Smith Machine...my hamstrings are the weakest part of my body, I'm doing lots of stretching to correct my bad posture.

Story:
This is what I look like right now. Up until recently, I’d gone through life as the quintessential 98-pound weakling. I was always active (I even competed in Goju Ryu Karate tournaments in Jr. high) but I was never very strong. I was not OK with this; it didn’t reconcile with the person I wanted to be. In high school, I literally weighed 91 pounds. I weigh twice that now, with less body fat, and I’m only an inch or two taller. The way I look isn’t nearly as important to me as the books I read, the music I play, or the conversations I have, but it has it’s place. I look the way I’d like to look. I’ll always push myself to lift more weight, to get leaner, to endure longer, but I’m happy to see how far I’ve come. I’ve seen my physical discipline translate into mental toughness that helps me immeasurably in academic endeavors. I’m not very comfortable posing (no disrespect to those who enjoy it) and I’m no bodybuilder or powerlifter, but I’m strong, and I’m happy about it. I put on 55 pounds of muscle in a little over 2 years, all while working 40-52 hours a week, going to school full time, getting married, getting divorced, and leading all measure of an eventful life.

EDIT2: Recipes- nothing special but for the culinarily impaired, this will do! (me)

* Check Potato recipe above, it's the best
* Cod (on pack ~$3.50, has 4 pieces)- dry them using paper towels, wrap each one in some aluminum foil, add a tbsp of butter to each piece, salt, pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic (that's the small piece, not the whole bundle...), wrap it up, bake in the oven on 400 for 15-20 minutes. add some lemon juice and BAM. hella protein.
* Orange chicken is too easy. throw chicken in baking pan, bake for 17 minutes on oven @375, mix in with sauce. eat this shit with rice and it's fantastic.
* Ground Turkey- cut up some onions, toss them in a pan with some olive oil, med hi heat. dump that turkey in, hack at it until there are no large chunks, cook it for ~10-15 minutes until the red/pink is completely gone. Add some of that bolognese sauce, cook some spaghetti and enjoy.
* Boil large pot of water. put corn on cob in water.once water bubbles again, remove corn (should be around 4 minutes/corn should be yellow....). remove and serve with butter/garlic/SALT.
* Green Beans- cook in boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes. drain, throw that in a skillet, add soy sauce, garlic, butter and let it cook for 5 minutes.
* Broccoli, take 2 heads(?) of broccoli cut them into little trees, throw in baking pan, and a LOT of cheese, oven for 15-20 minutes at 375.
* Sitfry: add some extra onions and slice up some mushrooms, cook them in a pot for 3 or 4 minutes, add the container of stirfry veggies found at Trader Joe's, cook until the carrots aren't rock solid... add to the rice and enjoy!
* EAT EVERYTHING WITH RICE. IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE.

* Start: 6'0, 170.6, 17.3%BF (Lean weight 141.1lbs)
* Now: 6'0, 178.6, 19.5%BF (Lean weight 143.7lbs)
* Had previously done barbell lifts, but had never been disciplined about diet/sleep/tracking progress

**Goals**

* Become a better flag football player
* Hit 157lbs lean mass at 12%BF (Approximately, Marvin Harrison's build)

**Progress**

* Squat: 155lbs to 215lbs
* Press: 95lbs to 115lbs
* Deadlift: 225lbs to 245lbs

**Routine**

* Starting Strength (haven't integrated cleans yet)
* Lift 2x a week (3x would be ideal but recovery is slow and I play football 1x a week)
* Various assistance work, depending on day/feel:
* Dumbell incline bench
* Pull-ups
* Lat pull-downs
* Dips
* Glute-ham raises
* Leg press (for reps, not weight)
* Kroc rows
* Leg raises/planks/bicycle kicks
* Farmer walks
* If I have doubts as to my lifting form, I record that in my notebook and look back later

**Diet**

* Big bowl of oatmeal + 17g whey protein powder + skim milk  for breakfast
* 5 eggs + 2 slices whole wheat bread for lunch
* 1/2 pound of chicken/beef/fish + vegetables for dinner (usually broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts) 
* 48oz skim milk + 51g whey protein powder + 5g creatine at various times
* I'm not 100% consistent with what I eat, but this is pretty typical

**Macro totals**

* Calories: 2700
* Protein: 269g
* Carbs: 286.5g
* Fats: 43g

**Sleep**

* 7.5 hours a night

**Equipment**

* HoMedics Scale which also measures BF%/Water%
* Chuck Taylor sneakers for lifting
* Blender Bottle for easy shake mixing
* Composition notebook (to track lifting #s)

**Observations:**

* I'm gaining fat pretty quickly. 2.6lbs muscle to 5.3lbs fat is not ideal. Going to switch to lower-carb protein powder
* That said, I'm surprised at my rate of weight gain on a diet that's ultimately not that high on calories
* I don't know if creatine has been effective. Despite chugging water to the point that my girlfriend laughs at me, my water% has only declined since I started taking it
* Recording my lifts has been a huge help in making consistent progress
* My recovery time is frustratingly long. It's 3 days at a minimum, and even then I'm not necessarily at 100%
* I jammed two fingers playing football. They were pretty swollen and painful. After a lifting session? Almost fully recovered
* I never want to wear pants anymore because they're all too tight now

Hope this is of help to the readers here. I'm also posting in hope of any suggestions you have, particularly on reducing my rate of fat gain and reducing length of recovery time

1365433294.0,49,self.gainit,1bx57x,"85 pounds 5'1"" F, aiming for 120 pounds, new to Gainit and needing all the help I can get.",RadicalAce,60,11,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1bx57x/85_pounds_51_f_aiming_for_120_pounds_new_to/,"So here's the story.


Grew up poor, always had trouble and issues with food. I never ate much as a fact of life, and couple that with IBS and a fast metabolism that runs in the family, and I grow up as a skinny food-paranoid twerp. It wasn't so bad, though; I was at least at a decent 90-95 pounds a few years ago.


The problem that occurred was this. I had to be placed on focus medication for my ADD, and while the medication did wonderful things for my brain, it cut my appetite in half and  gave me frequent stomach-aches (That may or may not be stress-induced). Couple that with IBS, and I lost ten pounds in a few short months. They took me off the medication overnight, and told me I needed to regain weight before I can even think of going back on them.


This was some two or three years ago, and I've yet to manage weight gain.


Now then. I've been attempting on and off to regain weight, but so far attempts on my own haven't given me much results. I've decided to finally give it a valiant and constant attempt and to give it my all to gain muscle and/or body-fat. I want to reach 120 pounds or so (140 would even be bloody amazing), where then I can comfortable be placed back onto my focus medication, and I can go back to being able to think rationally and intelligently again. If it turns out that adding exercise and the likes will also fix my attention and memory issues without medication, well, bonus to that!


As things currently are, I'm constantly struggling with attention issues to the point it's really getting in the way of the life I would like to have. I would like to be fit, strong, look healthy, feel healthy, and be able to THINK for once.


Thus far, I plan to gain myself this little bracelet thing soon https://jawbone.com/up to help me keep track of the food I consume and the exercise I do take. Due to my spacey-airheaded nature, it's far too easy for me to forget meals or to keep track of what I'm doing without some outside aid/reminders.


As for food, that's another thing I'm having some trouble with. I don't often get or feel hungry, but when I do eat, I tend to always go for fruits, vegetables, or 'lean' foods that don't do much to give me actual weight. The thought of eating grease-heavy foods makes me cringe, and I don't know what triggers my IBS yet. Each meal is a bit of a guessing game.


I'm considering signing up for some sort of exercise course, but I confess I'm a bit fearful of joining something up when I'm in such twiggy, unfit shape myself. Doing the dishes alone can be a workout for my stick-like arms.


SO here I am, a tiny flimsy thing of a person, hoping to get better and having no real idea how to start other than 'try anything for gods sake and keep doing more of that'. Suggestions on food/exercise/appetite, pointers, encouragement, anything would be good. I need all the help I can get as a complete newbie to all of this.

my bench is 3x5x225

I can't squat or deadlift because of a torn disc in my back, not sure what other numbers you guys are looking for. I have a 28' waist

I try to eat 3k-3.5k calories per day, definitely some dirty bulking because I am on a college budget. I could definitely eat a lot more and get bigger faster but I really like all the lean muscle i've put on, I feel very healthy and plenty strong so I don't mind taking my time with it. Trying to get to 180 by the end of September here.

I built my own routine from the ground up over time based on what was working for me (I'm studying biophysics so I put a lot of thought into building this routine which integrates training for strength, hypertrophy, and stabilizer muscles), my workouts were pretty lengthy on a 5 day split but now that I am on summer time I have switched to a 6 day split, I will post the general overview of my routine and if there is interest I can post more detailed workout specs. I try to hit each muscle group minimum 2 times a week and maximum 4 times a week depending on what I'm doing. I know reddit hates the long workouts but personally I have no problem with them as long as you front load your workout with strength training and make sure to eat at least 2 meals/ protein before beginning a lift.

So this is will be my routine for summer:

Day 1: Chest[bench, incline, dumbell bench, fly, pushups], Tricep, Abs

Day 2: Back, Bicep, narrow grip incline bench, boxing (~20min)

Day 3: Shoulder, Legs, Abs, swimming (~20-30min)

Day 4: Rest

Day5-7: Repeat

The cardio is something I am adding on for this summer, as I bulked up to this point there wasn't much need for it because I have a very fast metabolism. I am only doing it now to be healthy, independently from my gains.

again I can post specific reps &amp; exercises if people are actually interested, don't want to waste time if no one is going to read it lol",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_1gh7pd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1gh7pd/progress_19_61_140170_15_years_on_and_off/,

I'm naturally very thin but I feel like I'm finally starting to fill out. I'm 6'2, currently at 170lbs. I started off at 147lbs I can't even believe it!

My goal is 195-200. I just moved back home and joined another gym after taking some months off from lifting due to injuries, so essentially I have to start my bulk over after losing some mass. It's cool tho, I feel like going forward I have more knowledge and experience that will get me some serious gains for 2013. One of the biggest lessons I've learned was the importance of PROPER FORM! Leave your ego at the door, drop the fucking weight down and do your lifts correctly..really recruiting the targeted muscles and contracting them at the peak of the movement. You'll make gains faster than you thought you could.

I've always been the tall skinny kid, so please no ""it's genetics"" or ""it's cuz your black lolz"". I've worked, and still am working my ass off for a biggger stronger physique, and I'm determined to get there! 
Anyway here's some pics. 

This is when I started off at 150lbs. This pic is not from last year though, but from 2010. I was only really doing pushups and calisthenics at home until I started really hitting the gym at school. I was the same weight and size last May(150lbs) because I was too doing way too much calisthenics and not enough EATING!


http://imgur.com/oLxd0lr

This is where I'm now at about 170. Still feeling scrawny as fuuuh, but making steady gains. I'm all about lean mass so If it takes me longer to bulk than others that's cool. My metabolism is also crazy fast.

On legs: Didn't include pics because to be honest they are lacking. Didn't hit legs at all due to a basketball injury, but now I'm squatting 2x a week as well as leg pressing and trying to build up my calves. I find my wheels are responding well. It's crazy how much stronger legs really add size and strength to  your physique. Considering my height, my legs are naturally long and thin..but I know that once I turn them into treetrunks I'll really start having a stronger physique.

Goals for 2013: 

Hit at least 185
Add considerable mass/size to my legs
Build up my skinny as forearms
Get a much thicker upper chest
Widen my back

**Stats:**

Flat bench: 315lbs

**Note*: 
Some will say you require an off day every 2 days. I don't, but everyone is different. I have had great success with this over the years, maybe you will too. 

**Note 2*: 
Don't be afraid to use machines. I use machines, a lot. It is a good way to mix up your routines and put heavy load on those muscles. Always pay attention to your lift... the more you concentrate on every rep, the more you will shred that muscle.

**Chest Note**

Someone asked me about my chest recently. If you are interested in how I was able to build it up as such iv'e provided some help. My chest always lacked, big time. It all boiled down to form. Follow these quick tips for a blasted chest:

Chest was something that was hard for me to grow for a while. I always had 'decent' form (no arching the back, feet planted on the floor) but i've discovered a few techniques that will shred your chest. 

1) As always, mind your form. The perfect position for hands is where they are when your arms are perfectly perpendicular (your arms form a 90 degree angle) when the bar is on your chest. This is important as it will grow your chest as evenly as possible.

2) No bouncing, no back arching, feet firmly on the floor

3) ** Slow down, Slow up. ** Don't take the weight off the bar and drop it to your chest. 30-40% of the rep is the negative (on the way down). Don't cheat yourself. This is harder in the short term but massive upside in the long run. You will get fewer reps at first by following this, but your chest will thank you in the long run.

4) The most important Tuck your shoulders. This may sound strange but by just simply laying flat on a bench, you are enacting too much shoulder into the reps, leaving your chest days as chest/front delt days. Tucking your shoulders increasing the load on the chest, almost takes the delt completely out of it.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,1355203644.0,,,True,t3_14mznw,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/14mznw/progress_three_years_of_progress_m_59_145_187/,

So I've never really bothered to worry about my squat form because I've watched countless videos and done tons of research and shit. That being said, its always nice to get some confirmation on good form. 

As I was mentally preparing to move up to a 190 pound set of squats for the first time (i do this by glaring at myself in the mirror and clenching/unclenching my sphincter) there were some fellow gym dudes around me doing various exercises. People at my gym don't squat. There is only one BB rack for squats and barely ANYONE ever uses it. I found this fucking weird because from what I had been researching on r/gainit, I assumed everyone was on the squat team. When people *do* squat, its on the two Smith Machines and the squats are never deep. Needless to say I can't rely on anyone at my gym to critique me form, but reassurance came to me from within..my pants. 

Weights on, glare more, clench, bar up, feet out to the shoulders, drop it RIP. I felt my shorts rip and was fucking horrified. Sitting, er, squatting there with the heaviest weight I've ever lifted in the toughest position of the lift and all I could think about was the indecent exposure of my hairy asshole to my fellow gym buds. This visualization (of my asshole) combined with embarrassment made me start to crack up, which is fucking bad news when you're below parallel with the bar on your back. Luckily I pulled it together and reracked to check my asscrack. Luckily, only my boxers had ripped so it was a false alarm. 

Felt pretty good after that. This was the first time my boxers had ripped, confirming that I was indeed not imagining my ass getting bigger. Girls like that right? the Rip also let me know that I was indeed going deep on my squats. cool.

To the new one's out here. Try your hardest. Do everything it's on your hand to achive your ideal weight.

I went from 121 to 143 lbs. But I'm not done yet. My goal is to reach 165lbs, but I think I'm trapped at 143. I am very active through the day, and even though I try to eat 2600kcal per day (50% carbs, 25% protein, 25% fat) and if I workout or do cardio I eat even more.
I can't really win any weight. My goal was to do the weight gain increasing muscle and maintaining BMI (10%ish). Is that aiming too far?
Should I win fat &amp; muscle and then burn the fat?

Also, because of college, my biggest meal of the day is dinner. I know it shouldn't be like that but I don't really have other options. 

Any suggestions of how to gain those extra 20 lbs?

I haven't done the numbers, but you will see from the ingredients that each one  contains a very high amount of all your macros (for instance 100g of almonds is 2500Kj/500 calories and 1 date is 66 calories) Only takes 15 mins to make, and mine ended up tasting like a snickers bar. Here's the recipe:

You'll need:


100g chopped walnuts and/or cashews


100g almonds


2 tbsp linseed, sunflower seeds and/or pepitas

170g medjool dates, pitted and chopped

100g soft dried apricots or figs, chopped

100g prunes, pitted and chopped

1-2 tbsp tahini or peanut butter

2 tbsp raw cacao powder or cocoa powder

2 tbsp honey or agave syrup

100g desiccated coconut for coating

Protein powder - I added three or four scoops 

1. Combine the walnuts, almonds and seeds in a food processor and whiz until fine. Add the dates, apricots and prunes and whiz until smooth. add the peanut butter, cocoa powder, protein and honey and whiz for 2 mins until the mixture starts to form into a ball.

2. Divide into golf ball sized portions and roll into balls between wet palms. Roll into coconut and store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Freeze em  to make that shit firm.

I don't have a food processor so just smashed the fuck of the mixture with a wooden spoon in a high bowl. Mine are not as smooth as the recipe but are chunky and taste fucking tops.

I apologize for the bad pictures, I suck at taking selfies.

I recently got dumped by my girlfriend of 4 years, followed reddits advice and hit the gym. Always been the skinny guy, being so miserable gave me motivation to work out and take better care of myself in general. I found myself a job, schools been working out great and I've finally noticed that I look different.

It wasn't really before I used an old watch that I noticed a difference. I hadn't used it in 5 weeks and when I started using it again it was almost too tight for my wrist. It used to slide all the way up to my elbow when I was reaching for something, now it stays in place. Random story anyway, but it is kinda funny to me. :) 

I work out 3 times a week, monday,wednesday and friday.

I'm new to this reddit and as you can see my weight was really going up and down in that time. Of course now I weigh less than before but still gained much muscles (I hope this is what it is about?). I was a little overweight back in the days and didn't have much muscles. Between summer 2011 and spring 2012 I had to go to the army where I gained 8kg fat (and only fat, I'm serious). I was pretty fit before army and a wobbly something after the army (This post should not be about the army or whatever). From fall 2012 until now I tried to get back in shape. I was cutting and exercising a lot in this time, trying to gain much muscles and lose all that fat I collected over the past year. I'm really looking forward about your opinion:


12 august 2009 http://i.imgur.com/OBsbIDH.jpg this is about 82kg (180lbs)

13 september 2010 http://i.imgur.com/pohMiEU.jpg this is about 83kg (183lbs) I don't know if you see much change here. I was just working out (I'm 17 years old at this pics) at my school gym nothing special

10 december 2012 http://i.imgur.com/wIGCOEu.jpg This is a few months after the army at about 87 kg (192lbs) I was almost 200lbs at june

Then in this 6 months I made a cutting diet, much cardio and worked out hard and often

15 june 2013 (today) http://i.imgur.com/K0VfFCJ.jpg at 77kg (170lbs)

It may seem a little strange to you but between the last and the second last pic are really 10kg difference. There you see that fat is fucking heavy.
I think everyone agrees with me that the pre-2012 pictures are not interesting. The biggest step I made between winter 2012/2013 and summer 2013. My workout routine

Mo Chest/Tri 5 sets a 8 reps a about 80% max weight for each (10 sets all together) + 30 min abs

Tuesday Legs (Squats, calves, leg press) just everything about legs + 30min bycicling

Wednesday Biceps/Upper Back also 5 sets a 8 reps a 80% max weight for each (10 sets all together) + 30min abs

Thursday Shoulders+Abs/Back 5 sets a 8 reps a 80% max weight for shoulders and Abs/Back until I was totally exhausted 

Friday Break

Saturday Legs (The same as above) sometimes I was busy on weekends and had no time for workouts, sometimes I only did cardio

After every workout I made 45 minutes cardio (running, bycicling or similar)

Every workout took about 1.5h + 45 min cardio. It was pretty hard doing that for 4 months (februar-may) 4-5 times a week but I think it paid off.

Food: I made a low carb diet, ate about 170g protein a day (my bodyweight - bodyfat = 69kg* 2.5g protein/kg bodyweight) ate muuuch salad, chicken breast, veggies and fruits, reduced amount of alcohol massively.

Supplements: I took a Weigh Isolate (from Olimp) for the last 2-3 months and a Extra Burner from Body Attack (for Cardio). I drank a shake in the morning and one immediately after workout, I really can recommend the burner, this guy makes you sweat like a bastard!

EDIT: What I totally forgot to say: I'm trying to keep weight until my exams are over (august) and I want to do a bulking phase between september-december 2013 - my goal is to go up at 87kg [190lbs]) I would appreciate any kind of tips about that!

typical snacks; Pb&amp;j, mixed nuts, cliff builder bars, edamame bean, tuna, canned oysters, anything in bulk i find at Costco that has a good amount of protein and easy to prepare basically.



**TL;DR**: Probably way to much information, but what was every one else's progress at around the 4 month mark? am i gaining a reasonable amount of weight? lifts reasonable for my size? meal tips to help pack in those calories every day when out and about school/work?

When choosing a charter member, I looked no further than the #2 all-time post on /r/gainit (also the top progress post of all time by a strong margin). /u/Xolace posted his progress here a few months ago, and has since been an immense inspiration for many of us. I can't think of anyone more deserving. 

Xolace has had a long road to his gains, and with many who are on the path to greatness, the road had to become darker before the dawn. It started with a girl. Xolace self-described as slightly ""skinnyfat."" He overhead his girlfriend mentioning her interest in fit men. This put Xolace on the quest to lose weight, and fast. He restricted his caloric intake to as low as 800, and even as low as 500 on rare occasions. As he proceeded to drastically drop weight, his girlfriend and others complimented him on his progressively thinner physique, and this lit the fire in his belly to work even harder. 

Xolace quickly reached a point where weight loss was no longer advisable for maintaining proper health, but as the number on the scale dropped the drive to see that number get smaller grew. Eventually, [he reached](http://i.imgur.com/qPGXP.png) 96 lbs. at ~5'6"". The compliments faded and people began to insist he now needed to gain weight. Unfortunately, he was now crippled by a fear of fat gain. 

He was now jogging 10 minutes before every meal, doing 50 crunches whenever possible, and doing everything in his power to stay as thin as possible. It began crippling other areas of his life. The workouts became endless and more intense, and culminated in him losing consciousness while weighing himself. 

Now a year deep in a severe case of anorexia, without the girlfriend and with his life consumed by anxiety, he sought help. Doctors immediately put him on a diet pushing 6,000 calories daily while forcing him to remain sedentary. The weight came on fast, with some well-needed water weight and fat filling out his small frame. At first, it was difficult, but difficulty soon turned into drive and motivation to gain and eat more. He peaked ~130 lbs., but proceeded to lose another 10 lbs. 

At this point, he knew that he needed to step up his progress even further. He found reddit, [posted his progress](http://i.imgur.com/6dwGB.jpg), and was overwhelmed with the amazing feedback. He began studying fitness and health, and is now gaining at a nice pace of 1 lb. a month while increasing his strength. In his own words, *""I feel 10 times more healthier, 10000 times more stronger and 10000000000000000000 times more confident around females and even males since I've hit the 130 range. Every day is still a struggle and challenging, but it's getting easier as I keep growing, mentally and physically.""*

You're surely right about that. The beginning of your story is a somber reminder of how serious an eating disorder can turn someone's life upside down. That makes it all the more impressive that you've grown so much in strength, size, and spirit. I have immeasurable respect for the progress you've made. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say you are incredibly motivating and we cannot wait to see what further heights your gaining journey takes you to. **Congratulations, Xolace, and welcome to the Hall of Gains.**

-toaster strudel

-eggs

-instant oatmeal

-bacon

**lunch/dinner**- 5 dollar subway sandwhich with cheese, italian herb and cheese bread, and mayo.(makes 2 meals if you split it, about 1200 calories total)

-big tubs of yogurt/cottage cheese/applesauce

-rice

-hot dogs

-basically anything I can get from free functions or meetings
-pizza/burgers

-a lot of fruit juice,chocolate whole milk, and water.

**Supplements**

-1 scoop of whey protein twice daily

-Multivitamin

I know it's not incredibly healthy, but I put on weight with a meal every 3 hours and I buy everything in bulk from sams/costco such as yogurt and chicken breast.

**Background** 

I started going to the gym with the intention of gaining muscle mass in mid 2010 and getting a beach body with in a few months, very quickly I realized how unrealistic that was. After a few months I had some gains but nothing spectacular, I felt more muscly but had made no progress in weight or measurements. 

This lack of putting on weight even thou I was eating well, supplementing well and training hard gave me small alarm bells as my flat mates were putting on size but I wasn't. This was a blessing in disguise. I carried on training over the christmas period (was at university at the time and had to go home) where I was told I looked more defined but not much bigger, if anything quite thin and withered. 

After returning to uni, I kept falling asleep anywhere and everywhere, again just assuming because I was working so hard at uni and the gym, but this got to a point where would literally fall asleep if I sat down for more than a minute, it was highly embarrassing, this was my second blessing in disguise. I soon went to the doctor and explained my symptoms, to which after a short period of time, multiple tests and surgery, I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma (cancer of the lymphnodes). [This](http://i.imgur.com/r9bGTSd.jpg) is me just before I started 6 months of rigorous chemo.

My chemo worked out that I had 4 rounds every 2 weeks, which made me quite unwell for the week I had the chemo then just feeling a bit weak for the 2nd, so having nothing else to do and being so determined (as well as keeping my mind off being unwell) I trained, any day I could with a pretty good split that I have modified a lot but the basics I learnt in this period are still the basis of most of my current plans.
After 4 months of chemo I was still going gym but one day (remember it like it was yesterday) I was on the smith machine doing chest press, and started to feel unwell, but wanted to steam on, I finished my second set, stuck to my rest period, then dug in for my third set, hit 3 reps and felt a flush of illness come over me, a feeling I had come very accustom to, I was going to be sick. I ran as fast as I could to the toilet but didn't make it in time and threw up in the hall way of the gym, to then have to explain and apologize to the reception team, I was highly embarrassed and disappointed, as that was the day, the chemo had beaten me.

I didn't train for 3 months, 2 more months of chemo and 1 month of recovery.

At the end of my chemo (September 2012) and after the training that I could manage [this](http://i.imgur.com/Z3CoBOk.jpg) is what I looked like.

As you can see I look a lot better and I haven't trained in that picture for 3 months, but I was not happy with how I looked, my arms are really small, especially compared to my house mates, and my confidence was remarkably low, so.. BACK TO THE GYM.

I started training pretty much every day using plans that I had read about online and combining them together to make my own, I ate and ate and ate, and trained solid for around two and a half hours a day, that was my life for 5 months. I ended up looking like [so](http://i.imgur.com/YY4hdp7.jpg).

I really enjoyed my training but I knew that my techniques were rubbish and that I really didn't no it all, so I decided to do my Level 3 Personal Trainer Qualification (equivalent to the NASM CPT I think). In this course I learnt loads about plans, nutrition, exercises and techniques. After 3 months of training whilst I was doing all my qualifications, I gained around 20kgs (a lot of that was fat) but I was very impressed with the skills I had learnt and how well I had improved and how much I had gained. This is what my [front](http://i.imgur.com/PpTYBXO.jpg) and [back](http://i.imgur.com/jaadmat.jpg) looked like, as you can see I gained quite a bit.

Next I started a cut down as I was fairly happy with my results, but wanted less body fat, so after researching and using all the knowledge from my qualifications I lost one hell of a lot of body fat, but also lost a lot of muscle mass. Unfortunately my medical history meant I inevitably ended up in injury which meant I couldn't finish my cut down, a massive throw back in my confidence as I really thought my medical problems were over. Due to overtraining and not sticking to my own rules I damaged the medial collateral ligament in my knee and the ACL in my knee. This meant I had to wear a knee brace to stop my leg from bending, to allow the tendons to recover. I stuck to my diet and did as much upper body as I could and the final result of the cut down got me to this [state](http://i.imgur.com/zCVMRkm.jpg) which I was very proud of. I am on the left, with my brace nicely decorated by a fellow festival goer!

At this point (July 2012) I started my job as a self employed personal trainer, where I lost more muscle mass as I was working so hard to get my business off the ground I allowed no time for my own training, but thats what leads me finally to where I am now.

**January 2013**

I started my current ‘bulk’ and due to my now very large expertise and knowledge I have gathered over just under a year Im pleased to say its going very well. To keep on track I measure myself on a weekly basis and take photos,(the computer with the weekly pics is broken but will update when I can but here is a picture I took [today](http://i.imgur.com/FplPrnV.jpg).

**The Plan**
Everything is in kg’s and the weight is the amount of weight on either side of the bar.

* Monday- [Chest + Tri’s](http://i.imgur.com/MqWgibE.png)
* Tuesday- [Back + Bi’s](http://i.imgur.com/p2eezAv.png)
* Wednesday- [Core](http://i.imgur.com/564a006.jpg)
* Thursday- [Legs](http://i.imgur.com/GviOQ4y.png)
* Friday- [Shoulders](http://i.imgur.com/j9Gai8r.png)
* Saturday (Every other week)- [Barbell Compound](http://i.imgur.com/uhYDPVu.png)

**Diet**
I have stuck to a very simple and VERY clean routine, that is pretty repetitive but I'm still enjoying it 3 months in.
[This is my diary for each day](http://i.imgur.com/XPlOXEy.png).
*On a side note i will only have casein protien on days i go really hard, such as legs and barbell compound day, or on a day where i missed a meal, i dont take it every day*.

Frustratingly last week I had to have surgery on my feet due to side affects from the chemo so my leg training has had to take a small break until the surgery heals, but I will be back to it as soon as I can.

Im not where I want to be yet, and I realistically I think its going to take another year before I am there and can go into maintenance but we all know its a long process, which I don't mind as I love my training, its my drive for every day.

This post is kinda for myself just to remind myself of everything I have achieved as well as hopefully some people will see it and feel motivated by it, in knowing that no matter  what the future holds or whatever is thrown at you, you can become what you want to become.

And depending on where you are, they can be really cheap. The 1.1 KG tub in the picture above cost me 12.50$ with tax.

I ask this because I have noticed that in all successful progress posts, OP will generally have normal sized wrists and ankles. Conversely, I have NOT seen any successful progress posts with a very thin boned gentleman gaining a large amount of mass. 

Everyone on this thread says ""you're not special, you're not a hard gainer, you just don't eat enough"". But simply based on statistics, some of us have to be special. There have to be some outliers who would find it much more difficult to put on weight even if all other factors were exactly the same (diet, sleep, workout, intensity, etc.)

I obviously have a personal bias talking about this subject - I've never met anyone (girl or boy) with thinner wrists/ankles than myself. I have normal/smallish hands, and I can still fully wrap my them around my ankles such that my fingers touch each other. I can't even wrap my hands around some of my friend's wrist, which means my friend's WRISTS ARE LARGER THAN MY ANKLES. 

I think there will be other users who can do the same, and have thin bone structure. Has anybody found that bulking/lifting has helped your bone width increase? Personally, even after gaining 40 lbs of weight over 2 years of working out at one point, I have noticed no change in bone structure at all. Any thoughts people? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: I should have left the term hardgainer out of the title - it always creates a shitstorm of conflicting opinions. I'll leave the original post up above, but the question I really wanted addressed is this:

How significant of a limiting factor is bone structure with regards to the absolute genetic-limit of someone's mass-gaining potential? Does anyone have any examples of progress posts/videos of lifters with abnormally thin bone structure successfully putting on a large amount of mass (so that I know what I can realistically achieve myself)?

[Rebuilt](http://www.gearedupnutrition.com/multi-cycle-testosterone-therapy.html) is a multi-cycle therapy PCT, but can also be stacked with other, more powerful stuff like the Torque. I didn't stack them.

I didn't use a pre-workout on cycle, but when I was getting up to 196 I took Jack3d and creatine. Jack3d was awesome, but the formula has been changed since and I haven't tried it.

Sticking to SS has not only made me significantly stronger it has:

* Increased my confidence greatly
* Made me more punctual and organized
* Helped understand that real progress requires constant hard work and dedication

I feel good right now.  I feel capable.  I'm doing a tough mudder in June.  Can't wait to see what I can accomplish in the next 5 months.

Hello Gainit.
A year ago I decided enough was enough and I was going to bulk, I didn't really have much clue  about how to go about this however but I did know I wanted to be bigger. I weighed a whopping 138lbs and I was sick of looking so small.


**Beginning**
So, I grabbed some Maximuscle and decided to start running 3 days a week...and boy did I run. I had a six minute mile and could knock a 13 mile run out without even thinking about it. This was great, I was on my way. Press ups in the morning and running in the afternoon. A few months later I weighed 132lbs. Fuck.

How little did I know. haha. Anyway, I joined a local gym and was soon put on a machine routine/dumbells routine by the local staff.

My bench press was two 17lb bells for three sets of ten.
This was me.  [http://i.imgur.com/0QvqOaP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0QvqOaP.jpg)

**Middle**
I started doing a bit of reading on bulking up and routines. I tried my hand at SS and SL but I just kept getting ahead of myself which lead to lots of small injuries left right and centre. Over the next few months I kept going to the gym consistently, but my routines were all over the place. The only thing I made sure to do was out-rep the last session or put the weight up. At least I could measure some progress even if I had no set routine. I chewed down creatine and milk like it was going out of fashion and I all but gave up on running.

Here was me in June: http://i.imgur.com/ErC89P1.jpg

**Present**

For the sake of keeping fit I took up Karate, and I try to hit the gym 3 - 4 times a week. As it stands, my current lifts are as follows

**1RM: Deadlift: 258lbs - Squat: 219lbs -  Bench: 176lbs**


 My numbers aren't the greatest but I've come along way in 10 months of lifting I think given I've kept no real set routine and I started off being less than the weight of an empty bar. 
Here is a shot of me at 72Kg [http://i.imgur.com/OpVlaiw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OpVlaiw.jpg)


Edit: With legs.  [http://i.imgur.com/EUjkl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EUjkl.jpg)


**Diet:**
I hate to admit it, but I never tracked calories. If I did I know my progress could be much better. Honestly, I just ate dirty and focused on putting the calories into the 2500-3000 range daily. I replaced weight gainer shake with powdered milk (added to whole milk) and took to cooking everything in Olive oil. I drink two pints of choc milk after each workout also. Creatine... I rarely used towards the end of the year...always forgot to take it truth be told, maybe got through about 750g (tub and a half) over the course of the year.


**Onwards**

I hope to dial in a decent routine over the course of this year and My goal is to hit the 1000lb club at somepoint in the next year and a half. I believe it's doable, with a little focus.

Anyway, thanks for reading folks...


**TL;DR: Sloppy routine and diet held back both weight and lift gains, however consistancy with gym trips and a high calorie count still yielded some pretty good results.**

I'm fairly new to this subreddit, but I've been going to the gym very consistently for just over a year. 
I started at 15, which I know is young, but going to the gym has changed my life. I used to be scrawny and stick thin, and it took its toll on my confidence. Now, after putting on 20 pounds (I'm Australian, so that's 9kg for my Australian friends) I feel as confident as ever. It's helped my mental health, physical health, and appearance. I've been going with my dad, and we are now somewhat similar in terms of strength. 

I began at 67kg (147 pounds. Note this weight is a rough estimate as I did not weight myself when I first began lifting) and am now 76kg (167 pounds) and am 6 foot tall. 

I began simply going 3 times a week, doing everything every session. Legs, core, upper body. I'd start off and head to the bench every single day I went. Soon enough I gained a small amount of strength and hit a plateau, which is when I did my research and began a 5 day split, chest, arms &amp; abs, shoulders, legs, back. 

My diet has been lacking but recently I've simply been eating 6 meals a day and have put on about 1kg. Breaking past the 75kg mark was a challenge for me and was very rewarding when I finally did (and was the incentive for this post). Even though I know I'm nowhere near as built as some of you guys are, this is progress. Thankyou to everyone in this subreddit for being an inspiration.

Here is my first progress post. Worked out on and off for 2 years between the ages of 18-20 doing the typical skinny-guy-dicking-around-with-machines thing. Gained 0 weight and like 10% strength. Last winter started seriously researching diet and exercise and stumbled across this subreddit. It helped me a TON! I started doing StrongLifts 5x5 and about a month ago switched to StrongLifts 3x5.

In August I was out of the gym for almost a month and a half due to severe bronchitis. Upon returning, I found that I dropped ~10lbs of weight and it was extremely demotivating. But I powered through and finally set a new PR for weight today @ 173 lbs :D That is why I'm posting this as a 8 month progress, because I essentially lost 2 months just recovering from bronchitis. 

Lifts (all 3x5 numbers):

Squat 75 --&gt; 185

DL: Never done (prob like ~80ish) --&gt; 195

Bench: 105 --&gt; 145

OHP: 45 --&gt; 90

Progress pics:

http://imgur.com/a/NuwvH

The first half of the album is straight progress pics. The second half is my question/concern. If I'm standing straight I barely have a belly and even have a line running down the middle of my stomach which doesn't exist if the stomach is just fat and no muscle. But when I bend over it looks really fear. I have the skinnyfat gene and I have it bad. I'm really starting to get worried. 

I am planning to keep gaining till March (hopefully hit 180) and then cut for summer. Rinse and repeat for 1 more year after summer ends (gain to ~190 and cut to ~180). I DON'T WANT TO BE HUGE. In my mind, my ideal shape would be 180 @ 10%. But that belly is getting big! So basically my question is, is that cause for concern or will it burn off in 1-2 months once I start cutting? Will I ever have visible abs? 

Hopefully this serves as some inspiration to beginners that if I could gain weight, you definitely can too. I used to be very skinny, 0 appetite (could go on 1 meal a day no problem) but by forcing myself to eat more and reading up online I have put on +22lbs in ~8 months.

My bench press is up the most. I am currently hitting 4 sets of 8+ at ~165lb. I think my 1RM is probably around 200lb. I've been injured so I've made the decision not to squat heavy for quite some time. I do atleast 10 reps at about 160lb. My legs are well developed due to 15 years of skateboarding, so this is no issue for me.

My diet is mostly whole foods. I am lucky in that I work in a relaxed office environment so I literally eat all day, including huge rump steaks at my desk. Rice, Oats, Meat, Fish, Eggs, Cous-Cous, Vegies. This is 95% of my diet. I no longer eat because I like the taste. I just FUCKING EAT!!!

They began as a way for me to view my own progress. I never intended to post them on a forum.

I have alway been skinny. Always been called twig, stick, skinny and i hated it. I have always tried to gain but there were a few things i was lacking. Food and motivation. Both equally as important.

[this is me around 146lbs](http://imgur.com/vLJIUOk)

[Notice the two shirts so i i could actually fill out the xs shirt](http://imgur.com/1ILapjj) 

I joined the Navy a few months after high school. I actually thought that bootcamp would make me bigger.
[This is me the very morning before bootcamp](http://imgur.com/a4pR0py) I believe i weighed in at 151

Bootcamp fed me 3x more then what i was used to which i loved. However it did not help me gain any weight at all.

After A school i went to my first duty station. This shore time gave me plenty of time to dedicate to working out. This is when i actually started to take eating and training seriously.

[again](http://imgur.com/sxuQVlM)

This is when i started to go hard. I saw quick gains pretty fast. (being 6'1"") I think that because my whole life i have not eaten by body happily took in my food and calories to achieve a very healthy weight. I think thats why i didnt really hit a plateau. Every time i jumped on the scale i would be at least a pound heavier.
for the first time in my life i had a belly.

[annnnnd again](http://imgur.com/86p4B7A)

This is when i started to take legs seriously. I was not fond of legs but i soon realized that i needed to sculp my whole body. I do not seem much difference in the ~170-~182. I believe a gained a fair amount in my legs but mostly my stomach.

[about 182 give or take a pound for water weight and food](http://imgur.com/Y5fF1Eg)

[again](http://imgur.com/S7756WJ)

[I obviously don't know how to pose](http://imgur.com/BAKxdYI)

Im not to sure why all my pictures make me look lopsided but whatever. I know I have a long way to go but i though it would share with all of you my progress. Here is how i have gotten here so far.

Months ago i was on my own scedual. Whatever i fel like i needed to work out then that is what i did. I changed that knowing that i actually need to do a pre made regime. I have been doing the [shortcut o size program](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/shortcut-to-size.html) recently and i am on my way to finishing it.

Off the top of my head i normally do 3 sets of 10 depending on the workout:
Bench: 95-115-160
Squat: 115-185
Deadlift (4 sets of 4):135-275

My meals would vary from week to week. Normally it would be:
Breakfast- 5 eggs w/ salsa, apple or bannana, yogurt, granola bar, protein shake.

Lunch- Anything i made in my crock pot. Usually a big ass bowl of chilie or BBQ chicken. Glass of milk

Dinner- More crock pot or sandwich or hamburgers, nuts or whatever i got my hands on. Another protein/ gainer shake.

I would also snake on anything throughout the whole day drinking a lot of water.

Im sure this wont be your cup of tea when it comes to getting pumped but it works for me:
Stars over Texas- Tracy Lawrence
If you're reading this- tim Mcraw
Letters from home-John Michael Montgomery
I'll make a man out of you- Mulan soundtrack
American soldier- tody keith

### Moderators

/u/Troycar and /u/InMyDreams_Nahh have shown great interest and effort in making this sub a better place, so they have been brought on to help out as this sub continues to expand quickly.

______

### FAQ

/u/Troycar and the community recently put together a post of changes and additions to the [faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index) and those have now been merged! So I recommend heading to the [faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index) to check out the new additions and organization. 

Currently the modifications are only open to the mods, but once we have a solid base, we will open [faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index) modifications to members of the subreddit.

______

### Flair

You now have the option to make your flair tag gender specific. We have the blue option for the men, and pink for the women. This can help with some confusion when discussing diets and workout plans.

If you like, you can leave it a neutral gray. (because we know some of you like to remain completely anon)

Note: It has come to our attention that some people don't know what the flair is for or how to use it. Simply head over to the side bar and click the edit button next to your name (just under the subscribe button). Then enter your starting weight - current weight - goal weight (optionally: height).

______

### Progress posts

Progress posts are becoming more and more common, and that's a good thing! These posts help to keep us motivated. But we need to have more structure in these posts to help redundant questions and make it easier for the readers.

When posting a progress post, please include:

* Height, Age, Sex

* Starting and ending weight

* Diet and Lifting routine (and numbers!)

* Time period

______

### Weekly threads

We are going to start a weekly thread on Mondays for all the questions that you want to ask but don't want to make a post for. Normally, these are called ""moronic monday"" threads and are a place for all the ""dumb"" and constantly recurring questions to be asked. Keep an eye out for it starting next monday. (and we will post links to them in the [faq](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index))

______

### User input

That's where you come in. Please tell us your suggestions, concerns, questions, and comments. We will do are best to implement, ease, answer, and address them.

Breakfast- 5 eggs, bagel with cream cheese, 2 cups milk

Breakfast 2- 2 servings of oatmeal

Lunch- Leftovers from dinner, 2 cups milk

Snack- granola bar

Dinner-Varies but usually something chicken or ground turkey based with a pasta and veggie, 2 cups milk

Late night snack- Either oatmeal or 2 tbsp peanut butter, 1-2 cups milk

1363122187.0,40,self.gainit,1a662w,*As Requested* Cardio And Gaining,Gilbear3,50,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1a662w/as_requested_cardio_and_gaining/,"**Cardio And Gaining Weight**

Its a long standing view that cardio and lifting weights to put on muscle mass is a ‘no go’ however this is not true.

Its possible but must be done correctly.

The two most effective ways to burn fat and work cardio is via LSD (long slow duration) and HIIT (high intensity interval training). These two forms of training will reduce the chances of going catabolic (where you expend too much and start to break down muscle rather than build it), but don't expect to be able to run a marathon any time soon and still make serious gains.


**LSD**

LSD Training is very simple but MUST be done at the correct intensity and this is different for every single person. You have to work at 50-60% of your MHR (max heart rate). The best way to work this out is the karvonen method, to do that you need to know 2 things:

Your max heart rate, this is simply 220 minus your age
Your resting heart rate, calculable by counting your pulse on your wrist or neck.

The method is simple:
((HRmax − HRrest) × % intensity) + HRrest

Im 21 so my max heart rate is  199BPM (220-21=199)
My resting heart rate is 56BPM

50%= (199-56)x0.5+56= 127.5 BPM
60%= (199-56)x0.6+56= 141.8 BPM

So for me to do LSD training my heart rate would have to be between 127-141BPM. This doesn't sound very high and thats because it isn't, the name of the training says it all ‘long SLOW duration’. Its slow monotonous and quite dull. 

The final thing to consider with LSD is when you decide to do this in your training schedule, I would advise doing this at the end of your weights session, as it will only burn fat once all of your glycogen levels have been depleted. If you come in and do this on its own or at the beginning of a workout, you will have to wait 20 minutes (average male) before you start burning fat as you have to go though your energy stores before that fat will be utilized as energy.

I personally get on the treadmill stick it at 6.5kph and fast walk for 40 minutes at the end of my sessions as that hits my heart rate zone perfectly at 135 BPM. You will have seen people walking at a steep incline, and of course you can do this, BUT if you hold on anywhere to the treadmill you may as well just walk on flat as the whole point of the incline is to engage more muscles and increase your heart rate, as soon as you hold on to the treadmill you disengage those muscles and are wasting your time, so walk on flat!

**HIIT**

HIIT is something that has exploded into the fitness industry as of the last 2 years but has been around for years without people really paying attention.
If your brain is hurting [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1pGqkrkgr4) is a video I made a while back explaining HIIT.

HIIT works using your anaerobic energy system, a system that allows explosive power for around 10 seconds in the average individual. All you have to do is work at the highest intensity you possibly can for 10-15 seconds and then active recover for 60 seconds.

The best form I feel for this is performing a 100m sprint (or 80m/60m dependent on the time it takes you) at full effort trying to get 12-13s time, then walk back to the start line but as soon as I touch that start line you explode and give 110% effort again, repeat this for 20 minutes then go home. 

HIIT MUST be performed as the last thing you do before you leave for home because of the way it works; something called EPOC (excessive post-exercise oxygen consumption). What this means is over the next hour or two you will breathe at a slightly higher rate, which uses more energy, the feeling is almost unnoticeable but your heart rate will tell you something different. Even if you are sat down watching tv your heart rate is going to be at around 50-60% of its max, see the connection to LSD? This is the fat burning zone, so unlike LSD where you utilize your fat stores during the training, you are using them whilst doing jack all!

As well as being a remarkably efficient fat burner it is much more fun, and the sprinting is likely to give you good leg gains, in my eyes a win/win situation!

For all of you that want to know whether you can go out for a 6 mile jog on a Sunday after your lunch, the answer unfortunately (unless your RHR is something ridiculous like 30BPM) is no, stay away from running.

I hope this guide helps all of you, keep up the good work and of course ask any questions that you may have, I am a Britfag so my replies might be in the middle of your night time.

Good Luck!

I did not include calorically insignificant items (veggies). I did not include little things that I munch on throughout the day, so there will probably be several hundred extra calories a day. I always snack, my problem was skipping meals (hate cooking and dishes).

I really pushed myself hard, went to the gym 3 times a week, and after 10 months of consistent effort I'm now 140 pounds. In some basic lifts, like the deadlift and the bench, my strength has gone up over 50%. I thought this was good. I thought I should be proud.

Then I stumbled upon this Reddit, and checked out the Strength Standards link to the right. All of my 1RM ended up well in the **untrained** category. My heart sank. I'm half way to 35, been working out for 5 years, eat like a pig, and yet I have nothing to show for it. So frustrating.

Is there anyone who was (or is) as skinny as me and is over 30 that might have some advice? I don't know what to do anymore. I've been to the doctor. I've gotten BodPod and caliper tests done. Hormone checks. Everything. I wish at least there was something wrong with me so I'd know what to fix or at least have an excuse why nothing's working. But I don't know what to do, other than hate my body.

I'm sorry but I don't want to hear from you teenagers and younglings and your n00b gains. It just reminds me how I wasted my teenage years on the computer playing video games when I could've been at the gym.

Timing fluctuates often, but I follow it fairly accurately otherwise most of the week. I do slow-carb/paleo on rest days and lots of carbs post-workout. I'm lucky to have several friends who are dietitians and they've helped me with it. Even with this diet I'm often hungry. When I am in between meals, I snack on almonds and cheese. I am a very slow eater, which I recently found out is partially due to my bite being severely off (most of my teeth don't meet) so I'm going to be adding more protein shakes (oil/whey/spinach/water) into my diet to save cooking/eating time.

GOMAD: Tried it a couple years ago for 6 weeks and it was a total failure. I hit 150 lbs with GOMAD while doing Tim Ferriss' the 4HB workout and gained no strength at all.

I've never posted here so please bear with me. I was always a skinny kid with a little muscle. I never lifted partially because I was lazy, but also because I was concerned it would ruin my shot for basketball and also make me slower since I was pretty fast. I also had no work ethic what so ever. I started playing lacrosse my senior year in high school which instilled a pretty good work ethic in me. That summer I started hitting the gym with my good friend and got in the habit of going every day. I'm very happy with the gains I am making but I still have some more to go to be satisfied. 

Diet

I don't really watch what I eat. I just try to eat often and as much protein as I can. Typically chicken, ham, turkey. Pretty much anything I can get my hands on in college. Also, I drink a lot of whole milk, but not GOMAD. 

Routine

I lift Chest/Triceps, Back/biceps, and then shoulders on consecutive days during the week with abs Monday, Wednesday, Friday with the weekends off. I usually do 3x10 for most exercises. I mainly stick with dumbells for chest (incline press, incline flies, regular press, regular flies) as well as push-ups, dips, and cables. Back consists of Rows, Lat pull downs and such. Shoulders are military presses, shrugs, shoulder flies, and anti gravity press. I don't actually work out my legs because they were over proportionate to begin with and because I exercise them pretty much to exhaustion with around 4 hours of basketball a day. Although I recently injured my knee so I've been doing strength exercises at physical therapy to build my muscles back to their former strength. 

I tried to find a picture from when I started. This is all I could come up with.

**The story**:
I've ALWAYS been skinny and people would give me shit for it, and even though most of them were kidding, it pissed me off inside and so I started doing something about it. The first year and a half I did small workouts in my room and wasn't really gaining much, but then my friend took me to the gym and I realized how much more working out I needed to be doing if I wanted to get anywhere. So I started going to the gym and taking mass gainer and eating a ton and over the past 6 months I have made awesome gains and I'm pretty happy with the results! I've gained about 35 pounds, but of course hitting puberty/growing helped too.

My whole life (18 years old) I have been a bit thinner and I have had some body image issues because I felt too skinny. I am joining the Air Force and I needed to be at least 118 pounds in order to enlist, and I was at around 105 and 5'6. My diet routine ended up being to eat whenever I get hungry (all the time), so I would eat a TON of cheese quesadillas, sandwiches, and pasta because they are easy to make. I go to the gym about 3-4 days a week and usually do arms and shoulders one day, abs and chest one day, back and legs another, and occasionally I swim. As for SPECIFIC workouts, I don't really have any. I usually just walk around and do all the machines for specific muscles, which is probably not good, so I am currently trying to figure out a better method. I also try and do 50 sit ups at home a day and 10 pushups (I am not good at doing them).

This was progress spread amongst 3-4 years, and it's not the fastest nor best transformation, but I'm still happy about my progress in body composition and facial hair growth.

To be honest, this is just a reminder that it's possible to gain mass and keep it, because my diet/routine is currently all fuckaround-its'd up.

But if you stay on a good routine for AT least 6 months, you will see results regardless of where you start. I know I could've been way better if I actually stayed on a consistent diet/routine but college and life has it's ways of siderailing you.

Even though im currently hovering around 175-180, my goal is to hit the 200 mark and go from here. I'm still fairly slight of build, but I made this post as a self-motivator also, so I can become even more consistent for the future.

What do you do when you feel low on energy? Do you guys still push yourself to go to the gym? Some days i just feel like i cant accomplish anything, is it better to just take the day off?

I dont really take many supplements to ""boost"" myself before hitting the gym - anything natural that can have similar effects?

Before I start, here are my current stats: 20 / Male / 6' / 205lbs.
Alright so, I'll try to make this as short as I can. 

In my teenage years I used to be fat for several reasons (shitty upbringing, depression, no friends, etc.) At my worst I think I was (5'11"" / 205lbs / 25% BF) or maybe even a litte heavier. Anyway, one day I woke up and I told myself I needed to lose weight and it became my obsession. For a whole year, I almost didn't eat anything and rode my stationary bike for 30min a day, at least 5 times a week. I was so determined to lose weight that I ended up losing way too much. I went from (5'11"" / 205lbs) to (6' / 165lbs). I'm not going to bother showing you pictures of me when I was fat because  I don't even have that many, I just hated taking pictures of myself back then.

When I lost all that weight, I was so happy. Blinded by the fact that I was no longer fat, I didn't realize how skinny I had become. People I didn't even know commented on my body and told me I should gain some weight. It was frustrating but I told myself that they were jealous of my body and that they wish they were as skinny as me lol, how stupid. 

Fast forward a couple months later, I stumbled on pictures of Zyzz on facebook. Now love him or hate him, I don't care, this man changed my life on so many levels. As I was scrolling through his page, mirin' every single picture of his, that's when it hit me. For once in my life I felt like I knew exactly what I had to do. I finally had a goal, a purpose in life. To get the most aesthetic physique that my genetics will allow me to get. I didn't care how hard I had to work or how long it would take me, I knew it would be worth it and I still have that same mentally to this day.

It's been 8 months since I've been going to the gym and I can safely say that I've never been happier in my life. Just thinking about my future progress makes me even happier (hornier too, hehe).

So without further ado, here are my progress pics.

Before : http://imgur.com/a/5X8Af#0

After : http://imgur.com/a/alQAq#0

I eat about 3600 calories a day and I lift 5 times a week.
Here's my current split:

Mon : Chest + Triceps + Calves

Tue : Back + Biceps + Abs

Wed : Quads + Hams + Calves

Thu : REST

Fri : Delts + Traps + Abs

Sat : Biceps + Triceps + Calves

Sun : REST

I think my strengths as of now are my legs, traps and biceps. My biggest weakness is by far my chest, it just won't grow. I'm planning on hitting it twice a week from now on. I'll even try 3 times a week if I have to, I don't give a fuck, I want chesticles!

I wanted to join the US Air Force, so I needed to gain some weight to meet the minimum 132lbs for my height. I started doing bodyweight workouts(don't laugh) in addition to stuffing my face as much and as often as I could. I didn't gain much more than 4 or 5 pounds doing this.  This was sometime in November-December.

I was a longtime lurker of reddit and happened across /r/fitness one day. I heard of Starting Strength and had my doubts that it would work for me. After seeing multiple progress reports I decided I would buy the damn book and give it my all.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/dZzWf.jpg) is me before I was training. Sorry the photo is blurry, but you get the idea: I was really fucking skinny. The photo was taken sometime around mid 2011, but I assure you I was still that skinny up until January of this year.

And [this](http://i.imgur.com/1YwRQ.jpg) is me today, still skinny, but much stronger.

**DIET**

I tried to keep my daily caloric consumption around 3500 calories a day, but it was more like throwing a dart at a board numbered from 2500-4000. Depending on the day and what life had in store for me I tried my best to eat as much, as clean, and as often as I could.

A typical breakfast for me would be 3 eggs, a whole wheat bagel with cream cheese, greek yogurt(nonfat because I can't find the one with fat), a banana, and a pint of whole milk.

I 'll usually try to get a snack of fiber(almost always vegetables like SteamFresh packs, fuck yeah) before I eat lunch consisting of a high protein-low fat meat like grilled or boiled chicken. I try to couple the meat with a whole grain carb like rice or pasta and lots of it.

For dinner I'll try to eat anything with plenty of protein and carbs and healthy fat. I try to keep dinner lenient while following these rules so I don't go crazy only eating healthy foods.

I take a multi-vitamin everyday. I took creatine for 2 months, but didn't feel or see it working for me and I quit taking it.  I drank protein shakes for about 4 months with milk instead of water and stopped because it got expensive and I realized I can get enough protein through good food if I try. I started taking both when I started lifting weights.

**LIFTS**

* Squat from 95lbs to 205lbs 3x5

I've deloaded multiple times because of form issues with my low-bar back squat. The most recent time I had gotten to 225x3x5 when I realized I was letting my knees give in to abduction(caving in) on my ascent.

* Bench from 65lbs to 145lbs 3x5

I recently deloaded from 155lbs after some pain in my right shoulder that was from poor form. I was deltoid-dominant in my bench press until I read up some more on technique, rested, and reset to 135lbs.

* Overhead Press from 45lbs to 100lbs 3x5

I hated OHP until I buckled down on form and started doing it correctly. Now I fucking love it to death because it's given my narrow shoulder-frame actual, visible shoulders.

* Power Clean from 75lbs to 115lbs 5x3

My form sucks. I'm having a hard time utilizing my hips completely and I'm using a tad bit of arm strength to hoist  the bar up. I believe it's a mental block, personally. I'll keep at it and one day proper form will click in my head.

* Deadlift from 95lbs to 265lbs 1x5

I like girls, but I LOVE deadlifting.  The deadlift is my favorite lift, no doubt about it. I've scrapped my shins so hard from the raggedness of the barbell I've bled countless times doing these heavy sonsofbitches. Deadlifts have helped my posture and given my posterior chain tons of strength.  Figures your favorite lift would be the one that takes the longest to recover from, huh?

**ACCESSORY EXERCISES**

* Chin-ups from 4 unweighted to 3x6 weighted+30lbs

My second favorite exercise. I do these Marine Corps style(arms completely extended between reps) with a dip belt attached. I alternate between these and pull-ups on different days. People stare at me when I do these. I don't know if they stare because my gym shirts have sweat stains in the pits and they're unsightly, or because I look boss with all of that extra weight hanging between my legs.

* Pull-ups from 4 unweighted to 3x6 weighted+27.5lbs

Same situation as chin-ups, but I use less weight.

* Front Squat from 135lbs to 145lbs 3x5

I just started doing these a week or so ago. I have a hard time keeping my torso as vertical as need be and the weight of the bar rests a tad bit on my wrists when I'm in the hole.  I need to work on form. I'll make like old school Nickelodeon and figure it out.

* Calf raises(one leg at a time) 3x8 weighted+25lbs

I started doing these when I noticed my calves looked shrimpy.  IMO, calves are already decently strong, so I just do these for vanity's sake.

I do one legged standing calf raises on a raised platform so I can achieve full ROM while holding a 25 lbs plate.  I also do the sitting machine with whatever the fuck amount of weight I use, I dunno. Once my calves burn and I can't do more I stop. I alternate days with sitting and standing exercises.

* Dips from 3x10 to 3x5 weighted+10lbs

I recently incorporated dips on my OHP days to give my pecs something to do.

* Sit-ups

I use a sit-up station(?) at my gym that has a decline setting. I put it declined as far as it will go, hold a 25lbs plate on my chest and do 3x10 with the final set going until exhaustion(basically 12).

* Barbell curls 72.5lbs 3x7

I do these when noone's looking.

**CURRENTLY**
I've decided not to join the Air Force because I've joined the Marine Corps instead: the recruiting station was closer to my house and I think their uniforms are neat. Jokes aside, I did it because I wanted more of a challenge, the brotherly camaraderie, and a darker side of me wants to see combat for some reason.

I plan on trying to gain around 5-10 more pounds of muscle before I leave for boot camp in December while running as often as I do now to keep my cardio and endurance up. I usually run around 1.5miles to 3 miles on my days off from Starting Strength, the distance depending on how I'm feeling. I try to listen and feel my body, so I don't end up injuring myself from overexertion.

My confidence before I started training was almost nonexistent. Now, I carry a heaviness to my personality. I can feel I have a much more intense presence in social situations and people are more willing to relinquish respect and admiration for me.

Training and working out has helped my mental health as much if not more than my physical health. My priorities are in order, I'm focused, and lifting heavy ass weight has taught me how to overcome mental barriers that arise in everyday situations and not to give up when things get difficult.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_x50bh,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/x50bh/6_months_starting_strength_progress_male_510_22/,

Also I'm looking for any tips on routine or specific muscles that need more help. 

Current routine is a 5 day split
Day 1-back

Day 3-chest

Day 5-leg day

I started that split because I'm short on time for workouts but I have the same amount of time every night.

I'll humbly take any tips, advice and guidance you may be willing to offer. It's mostly diet, really, and discipline about maintaining the caloric and protein intake while I work out... but that's something I suppose I will learn along the way.

considering all the feedback I've gotten to far, it seems a bit ridiculous to aim for 180 at my height. Weight gain is certainly a big part of my mission, but becoming stronger and healthier is too, and if I put on only 10 pounds in 2 months I will still be happy (it's 10 pounds more than I'd ever have weighed before anyway!)

I admit, working full time and working out can mean a tight scheduele but it's definitely doable. The people on this sub that are gaining probably all have jobs or are at school everyday, so yes it can be done.

While you will see results from working out at home, you will not see the real potential results unless you have a squat rack, bench, barbell, full set of dumbbells and plates. This will cost you well over $1000.

2.) Working out on alternate days
3.) Get enough rest (at least 8 hours)
4.) Never let myself starve 
5.) Remove myself from most social outings because I feel that interferes with my weight gain program 

And yeah, that's all I have planned so far. I hear that 'consistency' is the key. So I plan on also working out regularly, but at home. I've only got dumbbells to work with. Would that be sufficient? 

And in terms of diet, I do not cook. So I'm more open to food ideas that are readily available. Oats, nuts, soya bean, milk, fruits, etc. As for the weight gainer, I plan on taking it in the mornings and at night before bed. (or after working out on the days that I've set)

I really would appreciate help in the sense of what else do I need to know before embarking on this journey to self approval? Each time I look in the mirror I feel ashamed, and I grow bitter.

I'm here to ask a few questions about an idea I have. 


I'm thinking of doing a YouTube channel based off of the principal IIFYM (if it fits your macros) cooking.

 idea is to have:

Essentially, various meals cooked and put together which will roughly be at 3000 calories, ~180-200g protein, 40-80g fat and 300-400g carb. 


No bullshit like ""meals for gains"", or ""muscle building meals"". No bro science. 


Essentially:
Ideas for the show:
* macro breakdown for every meal

* Cheap! (student friendly)

* small stomach meals: medium/high calorie meals which do not take a lot stomach space. Avoiding drinking calories (no gomad/2DEAD)

* high carb, high protein - low fat (workout day meals)

* high protein, high fat - low carb (rest day)

* 3000 calories meal plan - workout day

* 2000 calorie day meal plan - rest day 


About me: avid redditor, multiple accounts. Lost 180lbs, attempting to lean gain (calorie cycling). Used to work in a restaurant during my pre teen and teen years. Now studying medicine. I see a lot of people struggling to figure out how to cook 3000/2500 (etc) calorie meals and still stay within their macros, micros etc.

Am paying for a trainer right now because I had no idea on what kinds of exercises to do and what proper form would be for my main goal which was gaining strength and toning. I know I could GOOGLE these things but I like having someone to show me what to do, and to talk to. My sessions are almost done with her, and then I will be able to do things on my own.

I meet with the PT twice a week, and go on my own 3 other times in the week. With the PT I'm there for an hour and do 3-4 exercises in a set, and do 3 sets of that, and then another 3 sets with 3-4 different exercises than the first time. Usually the exercises are with dumbbells and bars, and we vary a lot. I've been doing lots of planks, and negative pull-ups (let-downs, I call them). Lots of squats and lunges. When I'm there by myself I pick a 45 min ""get strong"" workout on the Nike Training Club app, and then do 15 min of cardio after. Usually the elliptical or the bike. When personal training is over I am going to start SS. 

As for eating, I have TOTALLY changed compared to how I used to be. I think I've had fast food maybe 5 times in the last month. I unfortunately cannot stand the taste of eggs, which sucks because I know they are good for gaining.. instead for breakfast I have a big bowl of this awesome cereal I found that has lots of fibre in it, and tastes amazing and then I drink about 2-3 big glasses of milk. Few hours later, have a snack. Usually almonds or some veggies. Lunch consists of spinach wraps with either turkey or chicken, yogurt and granola, more veggies, and an apple. Lots of water. I usually work out in the afternoon so afterwards I make a massive smoothie. Strawberries, mixed berries, mango, flaxseed, apple juice, whey protein, creatine, and some vegegreens. Make just under 1L of that stuff, feels so good after a workout. My suppers are usually the same cause I'm boring and am trying to save money and don't mind eating the same thing. Chicken breast with seasoning, and pasta. Some vegetables. More water. 

It's been a month now of all of this. I don't get fatigued anymore like I used to. I enjoy working out. I enjoy eating healthy. The biggest struggle has been eating MORE. I used to think I ate a lot until I got the MyFitnessPal app and realized that I wasn't. 

I've gone from 113 - 118 pounds. I weighed myself today and was 119. WOO, getting there. My goal weight is 130. My arms have gotten a lot bigger, and my upper abs now show when I flex. I've lost 2% BF. But most importantly, I feel good!

I'm glad this subreddit is here. Most of my friends don't care that I have decided to change my life around and become healthy. They call me crazy because I want to get some muscle. Like girls aren't supposed to be strong. :\ I have about 2-3 friends that I can seriously talk to about this stuff because they also go to the gym and are looking to become stronger. So hopefully I can be welcomed with open arms. :)

I have a bunch of reasons I won't get into but I've been a little down today. Not because I'm going to miss her but because I know I'm going to make her cry and I know I'm not going to be able to console her about it. I felt shitty after work and took a little nap. I barely ate today and chugged ~1500 calories in a oat/protein shake to catch up and carb up for the gym.

I went to the gym way later than I usually go, at around 10:30 at night. I've never been to this gym before but I quickly find the squat rack and it has an old school feel so I'm with it. I do a warm up set with no weight. A stretch set really just to get my heart rate up and my form in the forefront of my mind. Nice bar, nice form, good stuff.

I throw 45lbs on each side, do another, shorter warm up set, making sure to tighten my posterior chain and quads, getting a nice bounce at the bottom of my reps. I got a nice pump going here. I'm really enjoying that I've taken my mind off of my stressors. No headphones here. Just meditative gentle grunting. I take a small lap and get underneat 175lbs. I'm all pumped up for my work sets and...DAMNNNN

Way harder than I expected. I missed my first workout in the 3 months on Saturday, and I think to myself, ""Here I am, the day after I miss one work out, not able to do 5lbs more than I started last week."" I felt like a disgrace. I kept my form tight and ignored all signals telling me I had to reset my weight. I finished the one set, ass to grass wondering how the hell I was going to do 4 more of those. (I do 2 warm up sets then 5x5 as heavy as I can, increasing 5-10lbs/week) I smacked myself in the face. I got beneath the bar. I looked in the mirror that was unfortunately there (I hate squatting in front of a mirror, it lets me see how hard it is for me) and I see myself turn into a 240lb beast. I know I can do this. I'm the fucking [strongest mother fucker in the world](http://youtu.be/YpC1KWe9dp8). I focusing extra on flexing every muscle in my body from my grip to hammies to my delts and traps and abs. I do a second set I almost called for help twice but focused. Kept my form perfect, ass to grass just giving 100% the whole time as I went up so slowly. I finish the set on the verge of tears. Holy shit, I walk over and tell my friend the squats were kicking my ass. I felt like I was going to fail twice so far and willpower'd through my mind telling me to let it go or call for help. Keep your ass out. Keep you knees in line. Keep pressure on your abdomen. You got this. There's no way you're stalling this hard on a squat after 3 days off.

Holy shit. So I walk over and tell my friend who's using some machine that these squats were so much harder than I expected. I felt like a tool coming to this gym the first time having so much trouble on my first two sets, as if I was trying to impress someone. I chuckle a bit as I look over at my bar and see 45+25+10+5 on each side. Wait a second 135+80...that's 215. I just squat two sets of 215 ass to the fucking grass without injuring myself (well my shoulders are bruised as hell, actually. That's kind of an issue atm haha). Granted, I set the weight down to 175 for my last three sets. 

The point here is not to do 22% more weight than you planned to do on a dangerous lift. The point is that real failure happens way after your mind tries to convince you it has. The true measure of a man is what he does when he's weak.

I feel like I'm going to gain 10lbs from the those squats alone. After that I set a PR of 195 on DL, too. Like, right after, 1x5. I feel pretty beast atm, although I just realized I lost my wallet. To make this post more valid I'm going to post pictures I took of myself flexing tonight that I'm waiting for my friend to send to me. 

* This was me January http://i.imgur.com/kZka0nE.jpg
* This was me two weeks ago http://imgur.com/rDGzCCX,PbliEsN,TqzdaeD,Z7goQDo#0
* I will edit in tonight's pictures as soon as a get them.

Edit: Still waiting on those pictures. Due to the request of a few people who messaged me, I'll share my routine and diet. It's no big secret and I'm not doing anything to crazy. The first thing I'd like to get out of the way is the mindset. If you're bench pressing and you don't ever need a spotter, you're not lifting enough. If some of your last squats don't take what seems like 5 minutes to get back to the top, you're not going to deep enough or your not squatting enough. I squeeze the muscles I want to use. I envision myself as a 240lb beast, and much like Arnold I think about moving mountains as I lift. I literally try to feel my muscles getting bigger through my lifts. On the way down, I'm preparing myself for the way up. If my last set is ever to easy, I make it harder by leaving my muscles under the tension. I'll go up super slow. This often makes people think I'm going to fail. I don't care what they think. I'm not there for them. I don't laugh in the gym. I don't joke about my fitness. I know this post was a little comical, but I'm very serious when it comes to lifting and eating, and I get quite offended when someone tries to tell me to use machines or to run cardio for an hour. Even worse when they try to offer me junk food. I don't eat garbage.

**Ok so diet-wise let's get my stack out of the way:**

* ON 100% Gold Standard Whey. Probably the most used whey in the US, and for a good reason.
* Animal Pak, 1 pack a day with breakfast. Aminos, digestive enzymes, vitamins, mineral, liver protection, and a whole bunch of other shit that's been really good to me. I've noticed way less dips in my energy levels with this, and I feel healthier in general. I haven't gotten sick at all since starting animal pak and I think it's a great thing to take especially when you limit the variety in your diet for simplicity.
* Universal Nutrition's Real Gains. Good stuff, high quality carbs and proteins for a price that can't be beat. I take 1-2 servings a day, although I try to keep it down to one.
* ACG3. A pretty sick PWO in my opinion although it is a little caffeine heavy. I'm waiting for a sample of Shock Therapy by Universal Nutrition and I might switch to something else just because if I take enough ACG3 to get a good pump, I also get a little uncomfortably wired and hungry.
* Marijuana. I take a couple of hits right before going in, say 15 minutes after my PWO. Really gets me in the zone and able to ignore everything else. I also tend to finish the joint that I started PWO after I get back, but that's simply for recreation and appetite.

**Here's an average day in my diet (please note that I estimate calories throughout the day, and the only thing I REALLY add up is the protein):**

* I wake up hungry as hell. I aim for 5 eggs, usually scrambled with garlic, spinach, tomatoes, and ham.
* I used to eat 2 cups of oatmeal, but have recently discovered it's way easier for me to just blend the oats with milk and a scoop of protein powder and I'm not sitting looking at my oatmeal get cold while working up the nerve to eat the last few bites. I drink that shit and it's done.
* I make a weight gainer shake for work with whole milk and as much olive oil as I can stomach. I'm a butcher and I need the calories to throw around lambs and boxes of chicken and shit.
* I always think about my lunch for at least an hour before I take it (I get 30 minutes at work). I usually go with either a big ass burrito complete with beef, rice, beans, avacado, etc. Sometimes I'll feel beast and just get some hot sauce and buy a whole cooked chicken/turkey breast with one of those 30g protein Naked Juices.
* Towards the end of work on my last (15 minute) break, I'll get 8-12 oz of a tricolor potato salad they sell at a nearby deli. It's got 3 kind of potatoes or something. I love carbs.
* When I get home I usually have a piece of red meat or fish (either trout if I'm broke, salmon or tuna steak if I'm ballin') on a large bed of rice. I use Cholula hot sauces because they're really fucking good and I don't eat much sodium elsewhere. I completely avoid fast food and processed/frozen foods. I only eat cold cuts (ham) in my scrambled egg breakfast.
* I chase that meat/rice meal with a protein shake, sometimes adding a cup of oats if I want more energy.
* At this point it's around 8pm and I try to completely avoid carbs. I'll eat a smaller (4oz-6oz) piece of meat/fish by itself and have a protein shake. One of these will be right before bed and one will be around 9-10. Cottage cheese and casein supplements are just do damn expensive for me right now and if I really needed to, I'd set up a protein shake on top of the toilet so when I get up to pee in the middle of the night I can chug that.

**This is my routine**

* I go Tues, Thurs, Saturday. I recently missed Saturday, my first time since I've started lifting again about 4-5 months ago. Days go ABA, BAB, etc.

* **A Day**
* 5x5 Squat (175? 215? LOL, seriously I'm going to do 180 next time.)
* 5x5 Bench (175)
* 5x5 Bent Rows (130)
* 3x8 Shrugs (215)
* 3x8 Skullcrusher (75)
* 3x5 Chin ups (trying to work my way to 3x8 before adding weight. Before I could do chin ups I was doing curls here)
* 2x10 Hyperextentions (70)
* 3x15 Kneeling Cable Crunches (I set the stack on the cable machine to 57.5, then 65, then 72.5 for each set respectively. I'm still really trying to get the form down for this as it's kind of awkward for me)
* 3x8 Calf Raises. (Haven't really done these in weeks because I tend to pull my plantar muscle everytime I attempt calf raises in my chuck taylors.)

* **B Day**
* 5x5 Squat
* 1x5 DL (195)
* Press (70) (I injured my shoulder 11 days ago and I've been trying to recover. I reset my weight and I'm not going to push this hard until my AC joint is back to where it used to be.)
* 5x5 Bent Rows
* 5x5 Close grip bench (What ever weight I used on the previous A day)
* 3x5 Chins
* 3x10 Kneeling cable crunch.

* **Previous story:**

    Im 21 years old and just 5”4 tall.  I’ve always been athletic but only in light sports, Basically tennis  &amp; running.  During highschool  i was always the skinny and short guy, I was not considered weak because I was considered “tough” in the sense that I was able to take physical pain and have strength besides being small.  Nevertheless,  I always  had that sensation that I didn’t impose any presence, and felt very underwhelmed when hanging with normal / bigger people.  My friends threw jokes like:  man, if you keep like that, you’re going to disappear from this world.

    About 2 years ago I hit a low 114-115 lb, I stopped doing sports and didn´t care much for eating right.  Due to the situation of my country, the majority of my friends left and I felt very insecure to go out and meet new people because I was pure bones.   For almost a year I didn’t go out much, just stayed home playing guitar, wow and studying.  During this time my younger brother was already 6 months into the gym and it shocked how much it transformed,   it really hit me that my younger brother now looks like my old brother and my guardian,   this is when I decided to take a change.

* **Gainit path**

    Started unofficially and completely inexperienced around march this year (weighting around 116lb) .  I Started going to the gym in my residence (which is very crappy) and did lifts here and there without a routine. I started a new job by that time and it was extremely hard to eat good as I ate horrible before and my appetite was inexistent.    Short story, I couldn´t bear my physique anymore and decided to quit the new job to hit the gym and have time to eat.   For 3 months I only gained 4 pounds at most  ( which is how I look in the first picture @ 120lb).  

    Started going to the gym around may 15th just when summer started until today and only took a 2 week break around august when I travelled.  Im training 4 days a week in a very good gym with the help of a coach and a planned meals.  Diet pretty much consisted on 4 full meals a day + 2 services of supper mass gainer shakes ( 1 in the morning and 1 after training).  I probably averaged 2800-3200 calories a day and avoided fast foods and sodas.  I can report later what im lifting now in terms of wheights.  I also don´t skip legs and have gained a nice amount there.
 
* **Current feelings:**

    I can only tell that ive never felt better before.  I can finally fill a t shirt, I have a huge confidence now and been meeting new people at college and in the gym.  When my friends saw me again after summer,  they were very surprised and told me that I did the right thing.  I don´t have the body of a kid anymore is all I can tell.  For someone of my height, I think those gains were pretty substantial . Feel free to gives comments or ask any question.

   I have to say lurking /r/gainit helped me alot motivation wise, big thanks to everyone here.

* **Hitting a wall:**

    I haven´t been making any notable progress the last 4-5 weeks. First I started noticing more overall fat, especially in the belly zone.  By no means I consider myself fat, but I think I have to be carefull now.  I haven´t made any change in my diet except that I replaced the super mass gainers with just lighter whey protein shakes.   After doing this change, I can tell that I did not make any notable gain the last month, just slightly more strength.  

    I really don´t know how to continue now, I know I have to gain more and then cut it back.. but I feel my belly has grown  to much.  I have to make a slight effort with my posture to not show it (I did that in the album on the later pics), if I am completely relaxed this is the result:  http://imgur.com/vOOKk .  My 28-29 size shorts and bluejeans don’t fit anymore lol, I don’t take it back but still.   The thing is i think I have to keep drinking super mass gainers to make progress but I don’t know how much fat I can take..  What can I do?? I am completely lost here.   As for genetics if that matters, most in my family are short and skinny fat.

    
TLDR:  Went from skinny bones to decent looking and now I’ve hit a wall with my progress.

Here is a pre-gaining picture: http://i.imgur.com/fs2CL.jpg. I tried to find something that really shows how thin I was, I always wore extra large shirts to try and hide my body. It was definitely embarrassing.


I started working out, and I had trouble bench pressing the bar. Squatting and deadlifting were out of the question, cause I thought I might end up killing myself somehow by doing them.


Three years of progress later (and yes, I can squat and deadlift which is awesome): http://i.imgur.com/YIDwx.jpg. I am still thin and probably have not been gaining as fast as I should. I do have a genetic condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, in which the collagen in my body isn't as strong, which makes me more prone to injury from lifting. Luckily, I don't have it as bad as most do, and the more muscle I gain the better ""connected"" my body will be. It does become an issue, because my wrists are weaker than they should be and are not keeping up with my deadlift (245x5 on the hexagon deadlift bar - I do use Versa Gripps straps to assist weak wrists). Occasionally my wrists get blown out (most likely my extensor muscles in the forearm) and greatly hinders my gym workouts for at least 1-3 months. If anyone has advice on how to get solid forearms, that would be appreciated!

From the article:

&gt;Squatting a heavy weight for 20 reps will not feel natural for your body. It will hurt. You will feel dizzy and light-headed. You will probably want to vomit. Go ahead. Your body may decide to completely shut down and leave you in the bottom of a squat, unable to rise.

**Blend 2 cups of oats by themselves into a powder**(tip: dry the blender if it's been recently washed before you do this.):600 cal/104 carb/20 bro

**Add:**

**7 cups of Milk** (I used whole):1,025 cal/77 carb/55 bro

**4 scoops of brotein powder** (I used Optimum's chocolate whey:480 cal/12 carb/96 bro 

**5 Bananas**:441 cal/81 carb/3 bro

**2 cups of vanilla yogurt**:360 cal/58 carb/20 bro

**2 Tbsp of Nutella**:200 cal/22 carb/3 bro  

**2 tsp of honey**:120 cal/34 carb

You don't need a gallon sized blender just use the milk wisely. I also bought a rubbermaid gallon bottle that I pour it in and shake it all together at the end.

**8 oz serving:487/35/23**

**20 oz serving(full blender bottle):1,217/87/57** 

This shake tastes much better and is cheaper than most commercial gainers and hopefully has a lot less sugar. Plus if you get bored with it you can always try changing to different flavors of yogurts or brotein. Maybe add a cup or your favorite ice cream or berries.

I didn't count the fat because a good chunk of it is healthy fat from the peanut butter. And I'm not to worried as much about fat intake as of yet.

 I have always been small, and underweight all my life. I remember my mother giving me 'meal replacements' in between meals in an attempt to get me to gain weight, and it had never quite worked. 

In 2004 when my mother fought and lost against cancer I went from 85lbs (35kg) to 72 (32kg) and became anorexic and nearly hospitalized and I have never fully recovered from that. 

In 2009 and 2010 I had (finally) got back to my 'starting weight' in 2004 and since then I've been pushing myself to gain, though it has never fully worked out for me. (Mind you, my mother was never over 100lbs (45kg) until she was 6 months pregnant with me) 

My goal is to make it to 100lbs and press forward from there and so far I've made my way back up too a whopping 96lbs (43kg). It may seem like meager progress, but it is progress. I would like to be 'normal weight' for a girl my height (5""4) which is roughly 120lbs (54kg) but that seems quite a distance off at the moment.

A little backstory. I have a condition called Pectus Excavatum. For those of you that dont know, that means I have a slightly concave rib cage. It starts about two inches above my solar plexus, and goes out about four inches from the center on each side. my condition isn't nearly as bad as it could be, but it is definitely a dent in my chest. 

I recently started to try and gain weight to see if I can conceal my crooked rib cage. So far so good I'd say. I'm curious if anyone here has this condition, and how their progress is going. I feel like I've gained weight from side to side, but I still look fairly thin from the side because of my ribs. 


I just discovered /r/Gainit last week, and I'm going to start Starting Strength tomorrow morning. I've mostly been just doing pushups, sit ups, and wide chin ups every other day and eating three times as much as I used to. I feel like this new workout will definitely boost my progress.

by Henry Rollins


I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.

Completely.

When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me ""garbage can"" and telling me I'd be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn't run home crying, wondering why.

I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.

I hated myself all the time.

As stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn't going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you'll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time. I didn't think much of them either.

Then came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the blackboard. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.

He told me that I was going to take some of the money that I had saved and buy a hundred-pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn't even drag them to my mom's car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.

Monday came and I was called into Mr. P.'s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn't looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time was I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn't want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.

Weeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn't know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.

Right before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away. You couldn't say s--t to me.

It took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn't want to come off the mat, it's the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn't teach you anything. That's the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble. That which you work against will always work against you.

It wasn't until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can't be as bad as that workout.

I used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn't ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you're not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.

I have never met a truly strong person who didn't have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone's shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr.Pepperman.

Muscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.

Yukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.

Everything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn't see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.

I prefer to work out alone.

It enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you're made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me how to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it's some kind of miracle if you're not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.

I see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.

Through the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.

The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it's impossible to turn back.

The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you're a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.

I don't speak to girls and I feel weak and small around everybody else.

I'm 6ft tall and weigh around 50kg, yes, it's that bad. 
I do eat, but very sporadically and the only reason I don't eat more is because there isn't food in the fridge/cupboards - I am nearly always hungry. I'm living with my grandmother at the moment and there are no supermarkets nearby so I'm just eating 'scraps' really.

I'm going to go shopping and buy a weeks worth of food every week. I'm not sure what would be good for me but I guess Chicken, rice, pasta, veg, fish, eggs are good. I can't eat/drink dairy so milk is out of the question. If I make 'meal plans' and have a 500cal weight gain shake a day, will I see progress? 
I don't want to go to a gym at the moment as I want to put some weight on first (my self confidence is that bad...)
I can buy dumbells for home and do pushups etc but I'm not sure what routine I should follow, I'm really clueless when it comes to fitness/weights.

I'm finally trying to do something about it after a great lack of motivation for the past few years of my life, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Male, 23, 6 foot 2, started at 175 lb., goal was 200 in six months, but only got to 195. I'm attributing this to having to skip a few weeks (not consecutive) due to sickness and injury.

I lift 4 times a week, about an hour each time, using a circuit that I made up for myself that uses at least 2 muscle groups each day, while letting muscle groups rest at least a day, and using each group twice a week. I can post a detailed schedule if someone wants to see it.

My main focus has been on chest, shoulders, and arms. No legwork, since my legs are hams, due to soccer, mountain biking, running, etc.

Diet is mostly protein shake (with creatine), chicken, tilapia, frozen veggies, rice, and pasta.

185.42 - 100 = 85.42 kg. x 2.2 = 187.92 lbs.

Now, this formula is not meant to give you the definitive, perfect weight for your height, but it does give you a general idea of what you should strive for.

1361580664.0,29,self.gainit,191z0l,[MOD] Help choose the new /r/gainit image for March,InMyDreams_Nahh,34,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/191z0l/mod_help_choose_the_new_rgainit_image_for_march/,"Hello gainers! Recently, I surveyed /r/gainit to see how they felt about the subreddit image. I learned two things from that survey:

1. The subreddit was very divided on what the image should represent.
2. We are catering to a diverse group of tastes and preferences.

The solution? 

1. Have a contest for the users to submit their own images to be the face of the subreddit. 
2. Hold the contest monthly so that the images will always reflect the current majority preference of the subreddit. 

The contest will be held monthly, starting the week prior to the end of the month. At the end of the month, the most upvoted submission will be the new image of /r/gainit for the following month. 

*****

### Contest Rules

1. Please make submissions using [imgur](http://www.imgur.com).
2. Make submissions to this thread in the comments.
3. All images must be SFW, and be related to food/gaining.
4. No text in the images, memes, or meme-like images.
5. Upvote the images that you like.
6. Please refrain from excessive downvoting/criticism. I would like all users to feel encouraged to be creative and submit images. If you feel an image is inappropriate, report it.
7. The most upvoted image will be the new image of /r/gainit for March.
8. The contest will end at 11:59 P.M. on February 28, 2013.

The next contest will be held in the final week of March to choose the image for the month of April. Best of luck, and have fun!

You'll need oil, a pound of chicken breasts, an onion, chicken stock/broth, and peanut butter.  
  
1. Heat up the oil and add the chicken (should be cut in to 1 inch chunks). And cook that shit.  
2. After the chicken looks cooked (white) add the onions (diced to preference). Cook/stir that shit for like 5 minuets.

As for the nutrition/working out - I had just posted them on the other thread, so i'll just copypasta. 



Nutrition : On a good day - Breakfast(7am) - Oatmeal Snack(10am) - Glass of milk and peanut butter toast Pregym snack(11:30a) - Toast Gym during lunch(noon) post gym gainer shake, a soda, and some carbs. Lunch (3p)- Usually a sandwich..I know it sounds disgusting but i've grown quite partial to Peanut butter and cheese sandwiches. HEY! Don't knock it til you've tried it. (6p) Another snack of nuts, or something small..protein related. Dinner - This varies, honestly I try to make it protein focused but it doesn't always end up that way. My girlfriend loves tacos, so I usually cook those. Before bed - I'll usually drink atleast 1-2 glasses of milk. This is a pretty good day, and I don't always stick to it. I just always try to keep eating every 3-4 hours or so
Workout- It's changed a lot from time to time. On average I do about 4-5 days a week working out. I'll usually do Chest twice a week(because it builds poorly), back, arms, and an all around day where I work on whatever it is i feel I lacked that week. I've went from doing cardio and running every other day training, to doing absolutely no cardio at all.

I've been 150 pounds, 5'11'' for a long time, but starting this summer I'm up to around 160. I've been working out a lot for the past year, but recently I began drinking a lot of milk (2% not whole) and eating more healthily. 

For diet: I've found that eggs in the morning and a healthy meaty sandwich (usually turkey on wheat) for lunch help a lot, and I eat 1 or 2 sweet potatoes for a snack per day along with assorted nuts. Sweet potatoes raw are an easy snack and taste great to me. Personally, I don't like taking a long time to make a meal. Another great one is black beans (I eat goya) with some mexican cheese. Great protein.

For workouts: I rotate on a 4 day workout with a lot of variation. The main days for me are [back and bi's], [shoulders and legs], rest day, and [chest and tri's]. I work out abs every other day, and am stopping hard cardio until I feel I've gained enough weight. REMEMBER: It's hard to gain weight if you're using all your calories during cardio.

Some might ask: if I cut out cardio, will I become unhealthy?
My answer: No, as long as you keep a healthy diet and do cardio at least once a week. Remember, it's the calories we want to get more of.

The most important thing I've learned so far (for me) is that I haven't been getting enough calories to gain weight. Try doing physical activities during the day that don't necessarily raise your heart rate to a point that you're burning a lot of calories, but that will make you hungry. (not sure if this is scientific but it's worked for me). I work at an animal hospital and stand for 6 or so hours at a time while cleaning cages. Physically exhausting but doesn't raise the heart rate too much. I come home with a giant appetite.

Hope this helped.

TLDR: 1. Do physical activities that don't burn too many calories to raise appetite. 2. Eat more healthy foods and snacks even if they don't taste good, supplementing them with protein shakes and bars. 3. Keep a good workout going while increasing your diet. 

You should see results within a few weeks to a month. I gained around 4 or 5 pounds in a month. Any more than this is somewhat unhealthy, from what I've read.

and back pic
http://i.imgur.com/5GfYJZi.jpg

Took me about a 7-8 months to get the bulk of the gains. I went from 66kg to 70-72kg slowly initially then I started to take diet more seriously and gained very fast.

Goal is to get to about 90kg. Currently 18 years of age.



At request of some people I'll go into more detail.


I work out 5-6 times a week. It's usually 3 days on 1 day off. 

**Shoulders/Chest:**

Incline dumbbell press

Dumbbell pull overs

Flat dumbbell press. 

Arnold press or Shoulder press.

Lateral delt raise

Front delt raise

Rear delt raise or Face pulls.

Shrugs

**Arms/back:**

Pull ups or chin ups to failure as warmup.

Lat pull down wide grip 

Lat pull down close grip

Seated rows

Dumbbell rows

Barbell curl to failure x 2

Concentration curls

Pinwheel curls supersetted with hanging from a power rack for forearms.

Tricep pull downs

Tricep kickbacks

Tricep overhead extension or dumbbell extensions.

**Legs/Abs:**

Squats with just bar, 4 sets of 16

Bulgarian squats

Sumo squats

Stiff legged dumbbell deadlift

Hanging Leg raises

Plank

Side Plank

Crunches

Bicycles on back

Barbell twists






I train 3 days hypertrophy(light weight/high reps) then 3 days strength(high weight/low reps). 3 or 4 sets going to failure on the last set.An example would be on hypertrophy back days I dumbbell row 20kg for 10 nice and slow reps for four sets whilst on strength day I will do 3 sets of 6 with 40kg with slightly worse form.


The reason I didn't put my routine initially is because I don't think anyone shoulder be doing the same routine as anyone else unless your goal is simply building raw mass and strength. If you are bodybuilding I think you personally need to look in the mirror and see how you need to sculpt your body to get the best look with the body you have. My routine took me long to formulate and I am constantly cycling different exercises in and out to see what best suites me and you should do the same in my opinion. You need to do the research yourself at the end of the day and make a routine for yourself because no one routine works for everyone. Learn what muscles do what and proper form for exercises.

You don't have to do this, but it does ask where you found out about the promotion. Please enter ""Robert Miller"" if you'd like (again, not required). My fiance and I are competing to see who gets the most people check it out, and the winner gets to pick the next date night. So it would be totally awesome if I got to pick. :) But no worries, you can leave it blank.

Enjoy the free blender bottle and samples!

I mostly picked up on this after watching eating competitions, but realized that it really works.  
The only question I have is, is there any problem that could arise by doing this, or am I just fooling my body?   It's not like you decrease the calorie per bite because it just gets broken down.

I am now 23, and its well overdue.

Over the past year, I've come to realize the control I have upon my own life. It was a sad reality that I had to face when I realized that aside from my career, I have put zero focus other than ""trying to blend in"" into my physical appearance and ability. I ran through my past and imagined what life would be like and how would I have been treated if i had even just 30lbs more weight. It was a mindfuck since that's something that I never thought about being a skinny person. Culturally, I was fine because i wasn't overweight, but I had to begin looking at it as just as bad. Plus looking at how much more mature and filled out us men look with some weight was another tipping point as I've had so much insecurity with masculinity, being a generally quiet and gentle guy. Being mistaken for 17, or having other guys hit on my fiancee in my presence, done with that!

I have a really busy life, as a young parent working full time to support my family. Work always ends up coming first, and after high school, it's how I've been justifying not taking care of myself. A few weeks ago I began trying to eat more and load up, it was hard because I hated cooking and the time it took, plus the time it took to eat. In a stroke of luck as I see it, my fiancee started college about a month ago and I was tasked with breakfast and dinner for the family out of necessity. I used to love to cook, and I've found that passion again so I could check off that excuse. 

The next thing was the exercise, and it has been YEARS. I remember one week in high school I stayed after school and did bench presses alone in the gym. I let negative self thinking get the best of me, and stopped. Never realized it would take this long to start again. I realized that like anything, working out needed to become my lifestyle. So I decided to just start creating the habit. 

Last week, I made a spreadsheet, put 'pushups' in the field and tried my best, 17. I felt like shit about myself and my arms hurt the next day so I skipped a day. After the pain faded, I committed myself to trying for 3x15 a day of pushups a day, and I did it. Yesterday, I upped myself to 3x20. and halfway through the pain faded, I felt my breathing relax with each pump all of a sudden, and i just stopped counting until i got to ~80. As little working out as I've done, that was 'that point' we all talk about hitting where we commit to a better lifestyle. That day was yesterday, and today marks the true beginning of my journey. It will be slow, I will have to learn a ton about myself and working out/eating right, but I know it's going to be the best decision I will ever make for myself.

**TL;DR:** Decided to stop being a pussy, overcame myself, and started changing my life for a better forever.

 I first started lifting October 1st, 2012, when I decided I wanted to have a nice body for college.  I've been lifting consistently every since.  For all four months I've been lifting about 2 hours a day seven days a week.  On the week days I wake up at 5:00am every day to lift for 2 hours before school and on the weekends I just go some time in the morning.

Routine:
I do a four day rotation.
Day 1: chest and back
 Bench 8-6-4-2-1-2-4-6-8
 Lat pull down 3 sets of 12
 Inclined press 3 sets of 12
 T-bar row 3 sets of 12

 Back extensions. 3 of 12
Day 2: Legs

I dont know why but i dont really understand what it feels like to be hungry. Im am very skinny im about 5'9 and wiegh 45kg for the last four years of my life.

When i was a baby and started eating i was really fussy with food. I remember only liking chocolate and ice cream. Everything was force fed to me. I refused to eat even when they thought i would eventually eat anything when im hungry. This was not the case. This happened for a while and i got sent to hospital and fed through tubes until i was better. From that day on my family were more strict to make me eat wht they wanted. 

As i became older around 6-7 i still remember only eating my moms food. When we went out i would refuse to eat any proper meal but my moms food. I also used to eat really small portions. When i get forced to eat more than the portion i ate i remember throwing up because it was too much. 

As i grew older 11-12 years old i realised something might be wrong with me. I was feeling painful stomach aches. Doctors said it was probably heartburn and gave me gaviscon. Which didnt really help. A month later i went on holiday to damascus where i felt even worse. My stomach ache worsened and i was sent to hospital. I dont remember what happened to me but i stayed in hospital for while. I was given medication. I felt better.

Something felt odd though. Ever since that day i didnt feel hunger.

Im now 18, im still very fussy with food but i experiment alot more. I now can eat otger peoples than my moms food but i still dont eat enough i think. I tried going to the gym and lift wieghts but i realised i need to eat well in order to build any muscle. 

I just want to know has anyone experianced this and any advise you can give me to start gaining some wieght because i want to go to the gym and build muscle with my older brother.

Recently they have even teamed up on me to pressure me to stop by making comments how I moved up from a size 30 waist on my pants to 32(they completely disregard how the rest of my body has added many pounds of muscle).  I feel fine and confident with my body which is ultimately the most important thing but it is still frustrating when I feel like I am not supported.

Been getting a lot of comments from people who haven't seen me since before lifting, so I figured it would be time to post an update.  I have a ton left to achieve before I'm done though. Main reason behind posting is because posts like these continually make me realize how progress is attainable if you set your mind to it. Never ever went to a gym before month 0, but was athletic in endurance activities and pretty active hiker.



**Lift 1RMs:**

* Deadlift: First time deadlifting a few weeks ago, pulled 315
* Bench: From ~ 120 max to 200
* Squat: Was inconsistent with squatting, made little progress ~225 now (estimated)
* Press: ~ 90 or 100 to 130



**Lift for Reps:**

* Pull ups: 0 starting to around 11 currently (or about 6 with 25lbs added)
* Dips: Not sure starting to body + 45lbs 4x5
* DB Rows: 45lbs 4x5 to 70lbs 4x5
* Incline DB Press: 40 or 45lbs 4x7 to 62.5lbs 4x5



**Workout:**

My main focus each workout is cranking out the heaviest weight I can for the main compound lift of the day (bench, OHP, etc). After that, I add in accesory lifts and some isolation so I can get the most out of a workout. For the first six months I didn't do the leg day and was in the gym 3-4 days a week. Now, I'm doing 5-6 days a week cycling through this 4 day split.


* Day 1: 4x5 Bench Press, 4x5 Incline DB Bench Press, 4x5 Incline Flys, 3x6 Preacher Curl, 3x6 Hammer Curl, 3x6 Dumbbell Curl
* Day 2: 4x5 Overhead Press, 4x5 DB Shrugs, 4x5 Reverse Flys, 4x5 DB Overhead Press, 3x6 Cable Pulldowns, 3x6 Two Arm DB Extension, 3x6 Skullcrushers
* Day 3: 4x5 Weighted Pullup, 1x5 Deadlift, 4x5 DB Row, 4x5 Lat Pulldown, 4x5 Close Grip Pulldown, 4x5 Weighted Dips
* Day 4: 4x5 Squats, 4x5 Leg Extension, 3x6 Standing Calf Raises, 3x6 Seated Calf Raises, 4 sets Weighted 45 Degree Situp, 4 sets Hanging Leg Raises, 4 sets Ab Roller



**Diet, etc:**

* Clean eating, low carb, lots of meat, lots of veggies
* 2-4 protein shakes a day (1-3 whey, 1 casein). One being right after a workout
* Creatine
* Fish Oil
* Vitamin D3



**Me:**

* 22 years old 
* Weight: starting 135, up to 157 at 2.5 months, now down to 155. Saw solid gains even when I dropped calories a bit (2.5 months I felt a bit pudgy)
* 5'8""
* Went up a size in everything!
* Background with endurance athletics



**Photos:**

I really don't think the photos really do justice to the gains I made. I messed up the 0 month pics which came blurry not showing the absolute lack of muscle. Also, I don't think they really show the thickness I gained through the back, chest, and arms. Old shirts are super tight on me and are often too short now!

A chicken sub used to be my go to meal there but they go for around $11 and eating one everyday hasn't done wonders for my wallet. So I started to make these burritos which have more protein and less fat not to mention cheaper than a chicken sub. 

[Here's roughly what you get in one serving](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=20g+onion+%2B+138g+chicken+breast+%2B+46g+kidney+beans+%2B+46g+chickpeas+%2B+46g+tomato+%2B+1+tortilla+%2B+30g+avocado) - but to break it down: 540cals, almost 50g of protein and 3g of sat fat


Here's what you'll need for the filling:

* 1.2kg (~2.6lbs) chicken breast - $8.80, the local meat shop sells fresh chicken for $7.99/kg on thursdays so I always stock up then. Frozen stuff works just as well

* 180g (~.4lb) onion - 50c

* 400g (~.9lb) tin of kidney beans - 80c

* 400g (~.9lb) tin of chickpeas - 80c

* 400g (~.9lb) tin of tomato - 80c

* 453g (1lb) jar of salsa - $4.50, I use old el paso and mission brands

Total cost = $16.20, cost per 370g serving = $2.70

It requires minimal effort to cook; brown the onion in an oiled pan, cook the chicken then throw all the tinned ingredients in. Smear some avo on a tortilla, a bit of lite cheese and throw the mix in and you're good to go

I put the lot all into some plastic containers of about 350-400g which is a perfect amount for the tortillas I get. If I'm feeling lazy it's tasty enough just to heat up and eat from the container which is what I find myself doing at uni all the time.

I've been gaining for just a few weeks now and I have a question about these two exercises. The gym I'm at right now is very small and doesn't even have a bar for bench press. It only has dumbbells. So I usually get a pair of 40lbs and do my set. What I was wondering is how does that translate to my max on a bar? Does that mean I can only bench press 80lbs with a bar? So if the bar is 45lbs I can only put 15-20lbs on each side?

Also just for reference, what is a good bench press amount for someone who is 5""11 150lbs (hopefully my weight one day)?

Thanks.

Note: I'll be moving to a proper gym soon hopefully.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_1g89q6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1g89q6/bench_press_with_bar_vs_dumbbells/,

I noticed an error in Monday, though (it would be Monday, wouldn't it?). The totals for ""actual"" was summing the wrong cell in the ""second snack"" chart. I updated the link with the corrected version.


Hey Gainit,

I made an Excel spreadsheet to better track my caloric and macro intake. It's a pretty basic model that I'm sure people more Excel-experienced than me can improve but I think it's a good start. Since this is all based on only a little bit of research, I'll share my sources:

Macro conversion rates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUTPd9mTvWY

Nutrition values: straight from packages whenever I could. For fruits/vegetables/meats, I mainly used [calorieking.com](http://calorieking.com). 


**A little about the workbook:**

The structure of the workbook relies on ""vlookup,"" which references whatever word you type in the cell to the corresponding data in the ""food chart"" tab. So, on the daily tabs, simply type in whatever food you want to add (exactly as it's written on the ""food chart"" tab, capitalization doesn't matter) and the values will auto adjust.
 
The two highlighted cells in the ""Summary"" tab are the only areas that you'd need to adjust to meet your specific goals (and any foods that you want to add/delete...just make sure when adding more rows in the ""Food Chart"" tab to drag down from the bottom of the table, otherwise the reference function won't work correctly). Enter in your current weight and how many surplus calories you want to eat (watch the video). You may also want to adjust the maintenance calorie multiplier (currently set at 16 in the ""maintenance calories"" cell...again, watch the video).

Right now it's set for my specifics/goals , but everything is referenced so it should be fairly easy to modify. And, since you will be modifying this, I would suggest using the word ""blank"" (or whatever else you want to change it to) instead of deleting rows since it will make the formatting and functions work a lot better. Also, I manually added 100 calories to cardio days to make up for some of the burned calories...you'll have to manually remove those in the ""metrics"" chart. Any modifications represent add-ons/subtractions from the preset amounts...you'll have to manually change those, as well.

And now, here's the file via dropbox.com. Feel free to tell me of any improvements you made.

Before lifting, I always did martial arts training for exercise. I trained Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Muay Thai, and competed in a couple kickboxing matches at 145lbs (no cut) when I was 20. So I got into training for MMA last year, but wanted to get to 170lbs to be able to cut to 155 and fight at light weight. After failing to get above 155lbs and getting my ass kicked by any one that knew Jiu Jitsu and took me down, I gave up and stopped training and paying attention to my diet in December. I dropped to somewhere around 140lbs/145lbs. Then I got dumped, depressed, and didn't eat much and weighed myself at 137lbs. Someone at work said I looked like I lost weight, so I started eating more and, a week later, my friend told me to stop being a bitch and made me start lifting stuff. I haven't lifted since I was 13. Now, after 10 weeks, I got to 163lbs and I'm feeling pretty good.

 I'm not big, but for the first time; I feel like I have a normal body.


**Diet**  
[My Fitness Pal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/mtemplin5030)  
I get around 3500 cal/day. It's basically 2 bowls of cereal for breakfast, a peanut butter sandwich for lunch, and whatever my brother-in-law decides to cook for dinner because I'm useless in the kitchen/lazy. I drink 2 or 3 protein shakes a day with 2 cups of whole milk and one scoop of whey protein. I take a multivitamin and fish oil other than that.

**Routine**  
Weeks 1-5 I was at Planet Fitness, went 3 times per week, and just kinda made my own routine of bullshit. Day A: Leg press, Smith Bench, Lateral Row, Tricep Pull Down, Calf Raises. Day B: Dead Lift with DB (all I had), Pull Ups, Shoulder Press, Bicep Curls, and Declined Crunches.  
After 5 weeks, I joined Gold's and I just do Starting Strength now. I'll list my numbers from when I started (that I can) to my last couple workouts.  
**Day A**  
Squat: started (week 6) - 145lbsx3x5 / now - 210lbsx3x5 (I deloaded a couple weeks ago because I was kinda doing partial squats)  
Bench: started - 100lbsx5/3/2 (smith machine) / week 6 - 125lbsx3x5 / now - 160lbsx5/4/4  
Pull ups: started (with counterweights at about 30lbs) - 6/4/4 / now (no CW) - 11/8/6  
**Day B**  
Squat: (usually increase weight by 5lbs from the last one, might stick to 210 or deload again because my lower back hurts after I squat and that's probably bad)  
OHP: started (week 6) - 85lbsx3x5 / now - 110lbsx5/4/4, 115lbsx4/2/1  
Dead Lift: started (week 6) - 180lbsx1x5 / now - 245lbsx1x5, 255lbsx1x3  
DB Bicep Curls: started - 25lbsx8/5/3 / now - 40lbsx3x5  
DB Hammer Curls: same ^  
DB Curls on a decline bench: same ^, but always do 3x5 and use the other arm to assist if I need to

I also do planks and decline crunches holding a 25lb platex3x15 when I can, usually every other day.

Anyways, so there's my progress so far. I know it hasn't been long, but I feel pretty good about it. I just plan to keep doing what I'm doing and work on fixing some APT :( .

I go to the beach in 3 weeks and want to look my best for that. Any suggestions? Keep bulking? Start cutting? Critiques on my diet or routine? And could anyone estimate my BF% for me? I feel like I think it's lower than it is.

So it's been a little over 3 weeks and I'm halfway to my goal of a 15lb clean bulk. The only problem is that even though I'm eating super-clean, all the weight is going to my butt, inner thighs, and belly. (I'm sucking in a rather large gut in the pics) 

I lift hard 3x a week--all compound lifts--but I'm not seeing much muscle growth/definition. I know it's only been 3 weeks, but I'm wondering when I should expect to see some muscle mass vs gains in fat-prone areas. 

Here's my M/W/F work out...do you think I need to step it up? 

Legs:
- Squats 3X10
- Deadlift 5x5
- Leg Press 3x10
- Hyperextension 3x10
- Variety of leg lifts 100 reps

Arms:
- Curl 3x10
- Hammer Curl 3x10
- Skull crushers 3x10
- Military press 3x10
- Incline press 3x10

On T/Th I go pretty light...core stuff and sculpting exercises. Critique please? I'd be especially interested in hearing from some lady gainers since guy routines are so different. 

Thanks for being a great resource /gainit! Hopefully I'll be back to post a final progress report in another 3-4 weeks.

This is my first Reddit post, so I'll start with a bit about who I am and why I'm writing this:

I'm a 23 year old University student, living in Montreal, Canada. I've been browsing Gainit for quite some time now, and have loved seeing the success stories of others. You see, I'm...very skinny. I know it's not because I'm some kind of genetic freak or anything like that; it's because I don't eat as much as I should. I get that. I have a very tight budget of only $200 a month for food, and I figured today is as good a time as any to start bulking up.

To get started into the meat of this post, here are my vital stats:

Gender: Male
Age: 23 Years
Weight: 120 lbs. (54.5kg)
Height: 5' 6"" (66"")
Bodyfat: 4% (Measured with bodyfat calipers)
TDEE (w/ exercise 3 times a week): 2000~2300, depending on website
Time lifting weights seriously: NEWBIE

The equipment I have at home (I prefer to work out at home if I can) is as follows:

Bench Press (Bench, Stands, and preacher curl pad)
2 Spinlock, 10lb. barbells
Weight plates (2x25, 2x10, 10x5, 4x2.5) [Weight in pounds]
Exercise mat
Doorframe chin-up/pull-up bar
20lb Kettlebell
2x 10lb dumbbells
Weighted jump rope
Push-up bars

Ok, so now that's out of the way, here's my two biggest problems:

1. I can't do squats with weight, because I don't have a power rack or squat cage, and can't make one or buy one. I know squats are important for working the legs, and are a vital piece of any workout, but I simply cannot do them. Would KB Swings compensate at least somewhat?

2. I've followed Stronglifts 5x5 for the past month, and have seen no gains at all. Nothing. I know that means I'm not eating enough, or doing something else wrong. I am also fully aware of the number of ""EAT MOAR"" replies I'm going to read below.

Is there a way I can workout at home, with what I have, to gain weight? I know compound movements are best since I'm a beginner, but is the lack of squats with weight a major limiting factor for mass gain?

Is there something anyone could suggest I follow as a program for mass gain? Ideally I'd like to be at 145lbs, and see what I do from there. Is all of this possible with my budget and all things considered?

Can a guy whose been told he's a hardgainer, an ectomorph, and ""too fuckin skinny to be a man"" really succeed in this arena?

So, Gainit, I give you the Tabula Rasa; the blank slate upon which I will build myself. Does it really boil down to ""Eat 2500 calories a day, and lift for 3 sets of 8-12 reps/5 sets of 5 reps""? Can it really be that simple? Anyone care to help me find out?

I started both weight lifting and gaining back in March of 2010 based on the recommendation of a friend who is also a personal trainer. At the time I was 6'1"" and 165 lbs; however, I wasn't so enthusiastic about the gaining aspect of this. Ever since middle school I've had body image issues (i.e. thinking I am  fat), and so gaining weight was the last thing on my mind. 

Thanks to this friend, though, I set a goal of 180 lbs with no time limit. Just from being a beginner to weight lifting, and the increased appetite that came with it, I quickly put on my first 5-10 lbs, but didn't really make any effort towards gaining anymore. As enough time passed I hit my goal of 180 and was satisfied. For about a year. I still didn't quite like my appearance, knowing that I could be bigger and look better so I added another goal: 190 lbs. 

This one actually took effort on my part in terms of eating. I learned what my friend meant every time he said, ""well, you're not eating enough then."" How damn frustrating that phrase is for someone who's new to gaining. ""Why am I not gaining?"" ""You're not eating enough."" But I felt like I was, I was rarely hungry and ate myself to fill. But that wasn't enough. I learning to really shovel down food at every meal and surpassed 190 lbs. 

And then this past winter break came. I got sick to where I couldn't work out for a week, and then I separated my shoulder while snowboarding. I was out of it for a little over a month, all the while losing some weight. When I could finally hit the gym again I weighed in at 185 lbs with my most recent goal of 205 lbs. 

Progress: [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/jEXDj)  (all of them except for today's were taken post-workout)

And so now that I've reached 195 I've hit another mental barrier. I keep asking myself ""Have I become big enough?"" So my question for you gainit is whether I should stay at my current weight or gain those last 10 pounds?

Sorry for the long post.

Its just that I have gotten a million great pieces of advice on here that have helped so much and wanted to do something to give back. I may not have all the scientific knowledge but i really just wanted to share my story and to give some motivation to those new lifters out there or people who are just losing that feeling they had when they started.

Anyway, last march i was 6'6"" and about 175-180 lbs. As of yesterday, i am still 6'6"" and 202, and i still have my 6 pack! Some of you may say, ""OH JEEZE I DONT WANT TO WAIYT A HOLE YEAR 2 GET 25 POWNDS"" (dramatization of what will probably actually be said) but alas, the reason I am ecstatic about that gain is that i did not even realize how much progress that was. Day to day you will (if you are like me) will check out and analyze every muscle in your upper body (or lower body if you're like that ;) ) while you are brushing your teeth and thus you will lose the overall perspective of gains made. I remember when i struggled knocking out 10 reps of 135 on bench, and now i threw up 185 5 times the other day without needing spot. That was literally my goal from the moment i started lifting, to be able to lift 185 one time without help. I completely forgot till i found an old list of goals i wrote down when i started lifting. 

I really just want everyone to step back and think about all the progress you've made. People are so worried on here sometimes about gaining alot of muscle way to fast and it really makes me upset. I know some of you just want to be that guy in the gym everyone is jealous of, and one day you can! but remember its alot of work to get there, and that guy that you see worked very hard to get that way.

This may come off totally lame, but it hit me that i needed to share this today when i found an old shirt that i always wanted to wear but lets face it, when you are 6'6"" and 175 lbs and you wear a shirt to big, you look like you are 135 lbs. But guess what? I threw it on and it fit like any other shirt. In fact, i started putting on all the shirts i had that were mediums, and i really noticed they were way to small. All my larges that i was so afraid to wear are the only shirts that really fit me well. 

So basically the goal of this, i wany all the new lifters to post or write your goals, and maybe a few months from now or a year from now check to see how much progress you made. Or what would be even better is some of you gainit veterans to post that feeling you had when you started hitting your personal goals!!

sorry for emotional this is, but i just feel like alot of people on here have just turned in to robots, who forget the almost passion and fun you can have when lifting and hitting your goals and going up in weight, and getting lost in numbers of lbs and protein to take.

**Middle School**

When I was younger I used to always think being thin was good. People called my skinny all the time and I embraced it. Hey, what's wrong with being a little underweight?

Looking back, I was scary skinny. At 5'2"" and a little over 95 lbs, my BMI was around 17. I was involved in both soccer and basketball and could eat pretty much anything I wanted but I still wasn't eating enough. 

I kinda backed off from sports by the end of middle school and finished eighth grade at 5'4"" and 120. I couldn't find any pictures of myself from this time.

&gt;2008: 5'4"" and 120 lbs

**High School**

I transferred to a small school (~120 kids/grade) and was determined to redefine myself. This didn't work very well due to the fact that I never really talked with anyone haha. I hung with a small group of friends (who were also new) and none of us put any effort into mixing with the existing student population (this school was 6-12th grade). I should also note that I got back into soccer due to pressure from my parents.

&gt;[2009: 6' and 145 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/SGYwW5ah.jpg)

I backed off (again) from sports after 10th grade and started eating out of boredom. Near the beginning of 11th grade I clocked in at around 6'1"" and 165 lbs (no muscle at all at this point; all fat).

&gt;[2010: 6'1"" and 165 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/j4zsm4A.jpg)

In spring of 11th grade I realized I needed to change my life for the better. I got back into sports (lacrosse) and really cut back on my eating. 

During fall of 12th grade (2011) I was 6'3"" and 155 lbs. Even though I was thin again, I felt a whole lot better about my physique.

&gt;[Late 2011: 6'3""' and 155 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/msQ7BY9h.jpg)

&gt;[Additional pic from homecoming](http://i.imgur.com/vPTbpmJ.jpg)

I was hanging out with a lot nicer kids and wanted to improve myself even more. I asked my family to sign up for a local gym and started lifting weights 3 times a week a friend. 

At this point I had just started using the bench press and could max out at 85 lbs.
* 
By the end of the year I had made noticeable improvements in my arms. My peers really didn't notice until the end of the year when we had our 'Senior Squirt Day' and came to school in bathing suits and armed with squirt guns to torment the underclassmen. I caught a lot of girls staring and got comments like ""Man I didn't know you were ripped"" and ""You have the best beach body"".

It REALLY boosted my self confidence.

**College, Baby**

I started school at the University of Florida (Go Gata) and immediately took advantage of the awesome weight room they have. I was still pretty thin but at least was making progress on muscle size.

&gt;[Late 2012: 6'3"" and 165 lbs. Bodypainted for front row seats at the opening game! I'm the tall guy in the middle](http://i.imgur.com/4D9cYxd.jpg)

It took me a while to adjust to college life and kinda stayed to myself during the first semester. I got myself a girlfriend ([pic, she's in the middle](http://i.imgur.com/67kad0H.jpg)) so I really didn't worry about flirting with other girls that much.

Spring semester is a whole different story. I realized that my girlfriend was holding me hostage from the rest of the world and ended things with her right before the new year.

I made new girl friends, met some awesome guys, started doing more stuff around campus ([underwear run, anyone?](http://i.imgur.com/lLLwVNw.jpg)), and hit the gym even harder. I was doing a 5 day routine as follows (more details at bottom of post):

* Monday - Arms (Biceps, Triceps)
* Tuesday - Legs, Forearms
* Wednesday - Chest
* Thursday - Back
* Friday - Shoulders
* Saturday, Sunday - Rest

I started going downtown to clubs and got sucked into the whole Pickup Artist deal. I know it might sound bogus, but some of the techniques and openers in the books I read gave me the confidence to match my looks (I had also just gotten my braces off).

This was a big game changer for me. 

I was now able to walk into a club, get the attention from girls due to my body, and seal the deal in conversation thanks to reading so many pickup books and articles. I set a personal record of making out with 11 girls in one night.

&gt;[June 2013: 6'4"" and 185 lbs](http://i.imgur.com/s9d6o0U.jpg)

I've been busy working during the summer but am trying hard to maintain my size while at home. I can now max out on the bench at 260 and hope to be in the 300 club by this Christmas.

I decided to visit friends taking summer courses at UF for the 4th of July and had a blast. I was also a huge hit with the ladies. Back of my car, middle of the woods, you name it. I was absolutely shameless but had a LOT of fun in those several days. 

*I give all credit for my recent success in life to lifting and the pickup community. I'm so happy I found this community and am motivated to continue by watching my fellow redditors make progress with me. 10 more pounds until my goal weight!*

* Quads - Leg extension
* Hamstrings - Deadlifts
* Calves - Seated calf raise (I do these on the leg press machine)

Hi. Just discovered this sub-reddit and thought I'd give a quick update and some help if anyone wants it. 

Stats:
28 yrs old, 5'6, Asian, 156 lbs.

Current Lifts:

Bench 195 x 5

Deadlift 285 x 5

Squat 225 x 10

Workout Routines:

First 2 months I did [kris gethin's](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer.html). I took a month off for travel, and last 3 months I've been going Layne Norton's PHAT http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html

Diet:

Meal 1 - Oatmeal /w banana &amp; natural peanut butter mashed in. 3 hard boiled eggs

Meal 2 - Homemade shake. 16oz 2% milk, 1 tablespoon natural peanut butter, frozen berries, 2 scoops of BSN strawberry protein, ice

Meal 3 - grilled chicken breast, cup of brown rice, half avocado

meal 4- Sweet potato, ground beef mixed with pasta sauce, broccoli

Workout

2 scoops of BSN chocolate protein

#5 Post workout meal - chicken breast, brown rice, half avocado

#6 - cottage cheese /w frozen fruit. 

Sometimes I get sick of the food and I'll go out and eat. Usually panera bread or Chipotle bowl. 

Supplements

BSN protein, ON fish oil, ON glutamine, ON BCAA, C4 preworkout, NOW Gingseng (more for my brain), 

**Tips**

Honestly everything you need to know is in this forum.

* Workout CONSISTENTLY. I have been working out 5x a week for 3 months straight, NEVER missed a workout. 
* Weight yourself every week, take pictures every month. You need to see your progress to stay motivated
* Sleep 8 hrs a day
* Make your meals ahead of time. It's Sunday, I'm spending an hour making meals for the next four days. If you're not doing this, you're not trying hard enough
* Do WHATEVER it takes to stay motivated. If I dont feel like going to the gym I watch Zyzz or Frank Yang videos. Look at pics of Arnold. DO NOT MISS THAT WORKOUT.

Honestly, there's no magic bullet. There's no secret workout or secret supplement (if you wanna stay natty). It's just HARD WORK, and being CONSISTENT. Going to that workout when u don't want to. Go to sleep at 12am so you can get 8 hrs of sleep instead of being on Reddit. Eating chicken breast / brown rice AGAIN instead of heading out for burgers. It's about making those LITTLE DECISIONS, and they will add up.

My goal is to get to 170 lbs, from there I will try to be a shredded 160. 

Hoping to post a really good update in 6 months. Before / after of everything, legs, double biceps, rear lat, etc.

Last year I was training bjj and mma, I made 135 last spring. Early this year I decided to see how strong I could get. I've been loosely following a westside template for powerlifting training every other day, alternating upper and lower body workouts. In the last two weeks I've benched 225, squatted 345 and deadlifted 375. I eat a lot of metrx and builder bars, body fortress whey (which has creatine in it), and eat meat and veggies at the hospital cafeteria next to where I work every day, yogurt and cottage cheese, a lot of veggies with tofu. And beer.

I wanted to deadlift 405 by mid June, but I'm not sure that's going to happen. Looking to hit mid 170's and a powerlifting total over 1000 lbs by the end of the year.

Excerpt from the post; If you read anything you should at least read this:

&gt; ###Prologue:
&gt; I remember years ago when I first started working out and posting here I went out and put together a program all on my own. I thought it through very thoroughly and was very proud of myself when I'd finished. I made a new thread about it and asked for people to critique it in the title. I expected for the most part people would approve of it and might offer tiny suggestions to improve on it.

&gt; What I got was people telling me it was awful and I needed to scrap it completely and pick up a pre-made program which was created by someone who was an expert in the weightlifting/strength training or bodybuilding field.

&gt; I was upset and annoyed at the time, however it was sound advice. They were right. My program sucked, I did not know what I was doing and if I'd followed it I wouldn't have made any significant long-term gains.

&gt; Ask yourself this: Do you know more than Mark Rippetoe, Bill Starr or anyone who has studied strength and hypertrophy training for years and has had countless more years of empirical evidence to refine their knowledge on how to make progress in the gym? (The answer is, of course, ""no"").

&gt; Then why would you use some program you've made over one of theirs?",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,tier1,True,t3_1f1x0d,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1f1x0d/why_nobody_is_critiquing_your_workout_read_this/,

* gain muscle mass
* lose fat

My physique is of such kind that if it were left to a sedentary kind of lifestyle, it would gain fat around the belly (I have a gut and love handles) but the thing is that I'm also ghastly skinny in all the manly parts -- the chest, arms, back, and lower legs. In fact that's the way it is. 

[Here, look at a picture!](http://i.imgur.com/d8Z55yY.jpg)

The picture on the left is me in mid 2009; the picture at the right is me in 2013 (which is what I also looked like in late '08, early '09).

What you are seeing above is the result of a combined effort to lose fat: I combined strength training (just a full-body workout routine) with jogging gently at such a pace as to promote fat loss (so no endurance-training-type running activities). This worked back in '09. Then things happened and I'm back to being skinny-fat.

My plan was to gain muscle mass following the achievement of the fat-loss goal, but then I gradually gained back the fat (work, studying, etc.). 

Anyway so my approach had been:

* lose fat first, gain muscle second

and I have this experience to confirm that it works (at least as far as losing fat is concerned).

There were drawbacks: yes there was no longer a gut, but I was really damn skinny, and I don't know if it's more off-putting to be really skinny, or skinny with a gut.

But there are two other possibilities I haven't yet tried and wanted to ask (before I tried either to save me some time). Namely, they are:

* gain muscle mass first and gain fat along with it, lose fat second

* why not both? (gain muscle, lose fat) albeit perhaps more slowly

Has anyone had any success with either approach? If so, what would you recommend? I'm thinking I should go with the ""why not both"" approach because it makes more sense for a body to be more attractive if it's moderately lean despite a noticeable belly than for a body to be super skinny with the only benefit being abs of steel. I just need to know if it's worked for anyone else.

PS. I check FAQ before posting and couldn't find anything on this particular so I'm not sure if this has been asked before. sorry if this is one of those annoying common questions that are asked by beginners.

Oatmeal + Milk,
Peanut butter sandwiches (with various was to eat it like with bananas or dipped in yogurt) + Milk,
Chicken which I will cook on a weekend and eat during the week + Milk,
Pasta and vegetables + Milk.

Only 5 years ago, when I last looked for mass gaining info, it felt like the internet just wanted my money for an e-book that would sell me magic beans and try to sell me another e-book on an expensive, unreasonable diet. This subreddit is amazing. Bodybuilding.com is amazing. I'm finally seeing diet and routine info that ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

I've admitted to myself that I've consistently eaten beneath my caloric intake for the majority (if not all) of my life, where I would have binge days that made me believe I should be larger than I am. It's so inspiring to see people that start out with a figure that matches my own and prove to me that it's just hurdles I need to jump over in order to increase in size. A lot of these result pics are amazing.

Anyway: I just wanted to say thanks for existing. A couple days ago I started a clean bulk diet. Lots of raw nuts, avocado, chicken, tuna, whole grain bread, eggs, oats, etc. etc. I shoot for 3500-4000 calories a day. I haven't started any supplements or shakes as of yet.

Well I started lifting and bulking mid November at 140 pounds, and now mid March I am 165 pounds! There is clearly a lot more work to do though. I'm trying to get to 180 by the end of May.

I eat over 3K calories a day. My breakfast isn't too big, just a breakfast sandwich or something, but I then eat two big lunches and a big dinner. I saw on this subreddit before a way to make a 1,200 calorie protein shake and I drink one of those almost every day. I'm a pretty active tennis player (school and club) so I always need to eat.

Monday is leg day: squats, leg press, hams, calves, etc
Tuesday is chest/tri day
Wednesday is back/bi
Thursday is forearms, shoulders, and traps
Friday is what I feel I need to work on still

I started the new year weighing in at about 135, and I decided it was my time to make the gains. In order to do so, I finally quit using dip/snus, which I had been addicted to for four years. I also quit smoking weed due to the fact I have a drug test for an internship in the coming summer (One would think this would hurt gaining weight, but in my case it helped a lot). 

Surprisingly I have not gone to the gym yet, which I know is not the route I want to go. (I'm going to buy a pass tomorrow before class, and will be doing starting strength) The main thing that helped me is buying/preparing my own food from the grocery store rather than eating out/delivery. This helped because I now had food just waiting to be eaten in my kitchen, and it has been learning to cook new things everyday. The biggest thing for me was quitting nicotine though, because that shit ruins an appetite like no other. I have been tracking my calories very loosely, and have been shooting for around 3000 cals a day. 

Anyway, last night *(yes, I know this is kind of cheating by weighing in at night)* I weighed myself and saw that I hit 150. I don't know why, but that number felt awesome and rewarding as fuck. I'm going to try to make it to 160 within the next few months, maybe even 165. I plan on doing a progress pic update when I get 165.

Few quick food tips: 

1) Easy breakfast with around 800+ calories: Muffin with large glass of chocolate milk (2 cups). Prepared in 15 seconds lol

2) Here is a recipe that I've already used quite a bit for chicken enchiladas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYjUqHGQoRM&amp;list=PLUDVfp84wxJPnYKTSAH_QVVoLGSrOl-Ai (instead of doing the last step of adding the sauce/cheese on top and putting it back in the oven, let them cool, and throw em all in the freezer). I throw 2 in the oven at a time (325* for 55 minutes, then pull em out, put the sauce/cheese on, and put em back in for like 3 minutes). I don't know the exact calorie count for them, but I know it is pretty high, if someone could somehow count the calories for these it would be appreciated.

Hey gainit,

22, 177CM, Male.

This shows my bulk cut progress from July to December, with lift number progress from January 2012 to December 2012.

I spent about 2/3 of my time this year cutting 1/3 bulking.

2013 will be 6 month of bulk, followed by a 2-3 month cut.

Diet while bulking was 2.8 - 3.2k calories with 60% protein, fat carb cycle between workout days and rest days.

I did strength training 3 days a week from January to July 2012. I then did 4 days a week strength training, followed by 6 weeks of a 5 day split during November. During this time I ate about 3.6k calories a day for 6 weeks.

I am doing a 4 day split for 6 months, focusing on strength for first lift then a large amount of hypertrophy afterwards.

I have never slow bulked, always at least 500 over my maintenance of 2.2k calories.

Will try slow bulk Jan-Feb to assess how to limit fat gains. 

Ask any questions.

Lift numbers from Jan - December 2012 for 5 reps:

Bench 60KG-91.5KG
OHP 40KG - 62.2KG
Squat - 40KG  - 113.5KG
Deadlift - 60KG - 116KG (started this late)

I'm 23 and have always wanted to start putting a little more meat on my bones.  I live in a pretty rural area so no gyms or Y's or anything like that are within a reasonable distance to me, so I'm pretty much stuck at home when it comes to wanting to workout.  However, my parents recently bought me a pair of adjustable dumbbells (5 lb - 52.5 lbs) for my birthday so I can get into shape.  I'm pretty certain I can eat the necessary calories to make gains, but being able to do the exercises and lifts necessary to make gains with just dumbbells is my concern.  I've read a lot of people suggest doing SS, while others break up workouts into muscle groups on certain days.  I'm not sure how compatible dumbbells are with SS or other popular programs on here, so I was wondering if anyone could suggest dumbbell exercises that would be appropriate for gaining, especially for my chest, arms, and shoulders which are kinda wimpy.

**I am 18, 6'0"", 141 pounds currently**, and have been weight lifting for about a year now at Planet Fitness. I have always thought that I just have a super fast metabolism and it's really hard to gain weight.... until I found /r/gainit.

I have realized with the help of the ""MyFitnessPal"" app (the one that is linked to in the FAQ), that **I am short of about 600 calories in my diet**. I ate today like I would normally (actually a bit more than I normally would) and counted pretty much every single thing I ate. It's 7:10 P.M., and I am missing 600 calories from my goal of about 3000, which I figured I need from the app. **What's even worse about this caloric deficit is that my deficit is probably much larger than 600** because I weight-lifted today for about an hour today.

My goal is to completely revamp my diet. I live in a large family and my mom just does not buy enough food (let alone healthy food) to sustain my busy body. I plan on documenting my diet plans and other details that I think are important in another thread (I will do this quickly if anyone wants me to); I want to document what foods I buy, the cost, and the price per gram of protein of each food (because I love numbers). My **goal is 3000 calories a day**. I just have one question about that... Will that be enough to bulk up from 140 to 160 with an active job and workouts 3 days a week?

I am also unsure of how to **balance my workouts** (like what body group I should share with bicep day, and what specific workouts I should include), so if anyone has a good link, personal ideas/experience, or copy-pasta text they can share, please do.

Day 2 Update - Definitely shouldn't have started with a whole gallon, was up most of the night with a gnarly stomach ache, diarrhea and vomiting. I've had a bunch of bananas and the cramping is going down. I'm going to start supplementing daily fiber vitamins and gas-x or something like it to continue + probably cutting down to a half-gallon till I can get my lactose tolerance up. What a shitty night...off to a rough start. 

Days 3&amp;4 - Been drinking as much milk as my body will allow but letting how I feel dictate how much and how often. Averaged about a half gallon each of these days. Lifted yesterday, going to go do some light cardio and arm work today. My buddy started GOMAD the day before me and now on his day 5, he tells me he's been producing white logs in the bathroom. Luckily my body hasn't reacted badly since the first day. Will post after I weigh myself today. 
EDIT: Weighed in at 147 at the gym. My weight fluxuates a lot so I wouldn't contribute it all to pure gain but its more than I've weighed in months after only 4 days of starting the diet.

Today marked the end of the first week of doing it. Also the first time since the first day i got a stomach ache, but i popped a super-enzyme to help my digestion and the pain was gone in a matter of minutes. As for how I feel, fine but the heat and me being an active college student makes it hard to be full of milk all the time. I have noticed a slight gain of fat, mostly in my midsection. I feel a little stronger in my squats at the same weight, and I have also experienced a 10 increase in my bench press, from repping 155 to lifting 165 today which is the most I've benched in my life. I weighed in at 145 today, 2 lbs less than the last time I weighed myself but still heavier than i started out at.  Stay tuned for more.

Hey gainit, I just wanna quickly thank you all for the great tips i found on this subreddit and share my small, but progress nonetheless.

I've been thinner and weaker than most of my friends all my life and I wanted to change that.

I began with 2 months of SS where I got decent strenght gains but then plateaued and got bored of the training, after that i wanted to focus more on increasing size so now I'm two months into [Jim Stoppani's shortcut to size](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/shortcut-to-size.html) and I like it a lot.

As for diet I'm not much of a calorie counter, I just try to eat as much as I can, I  take creatine and a protein shake on workout days.

Recently i've developped a bad pain in my right shoulder so now I'm gonna take a break from working out for a week while doing rotator cuff exercises and hope it goes away, if you guys have experienced this and got some tips I would greatly appreciate because I can't wait to go back to the gym and make progress.

I havent eaten junk food for 2 months now nor drunk sodas.
I try to eat healthy and lots of food.I also got my first whey protein.

What I've learnt those 7 months is that you can do anything if you want it really bad and keep on trying.There were days where i couldht eat more or was sore and wanting to give up but those days are the most important.I still have A LOT OF WAY but for the fist time of my life im happy with my progress.:D

Edit:  Thanks for all the input guys. I went grocery shopping today and bought lots of snacks, Greek yogurt and foods with good fats. I also started adding up my caloric intake. Either tonight or tommorrow I'm planning on picking up some womens vitamins, I know I have low iron and may be anemic right now.

So, I saw the nutritionist, and while we were going over some things I could change in my meal plan, she gave me what I thought was a brilliant suggestion: **Mix milk with powdered milk.** She recommended 1 cup per quart of milk, which adds 240 calories, 35g of carbs, 24g of protein, and no fat if you get the (very common) nonfat powdered milk to the already-protein-and-calorie-packed quart of milk.

First and foremost, I want to thank the ever-loving shit out of all of you for being awesome and genuinely nice to guys like me! I've been lurking for about a month and just starting (1 week ago) to put on some weight. I've definitely felt a very slight difference already!

My information:
    145lbs / 20yrs old / 6'2"" / Male
    Goal is to gain about 10-20 pounds and create muscle while minimizing fat gain. (Easier said than done)
    Quit smoking about a week ago. I really just want to be physically and mentally peaked and my motivation finally overcame my addiction.
    In terms of a history of diet/exercise: I ran varsity track for 3 years in high school (long distance, 4x4, and 5k) and when summer of college came around, completely took a turn for the shitter and started smoking, drinking, and treating my body like complete shit.
    I have access to a full gym btw.
    And I have a fucking incinerator in place of a human stomach that just destroys everything I put in my body to make sure I stay a lanky, skinny, weak motherfucker.

Okay, so my dilemma started the first day I started to try gaining weight. I read the gainit and fitness subreddit FAQs and realized that I needed a regimented diet, good water intake, good sleep, do GOMAD, and eat about 3500 calories a day along with a workout plan. I ditched the running playlist and made a lifting playlist. I'm all set to go as I lay my first meal of 5 eggs, 2 pieces of toast with peanut butter and a glass of whole milk. On the first day, I ate like a madman and afterwards, felt like I was going to puke my stomach out. So I figured this would only last a day or two then I'd get used to eating such a large of amount of food (please note: I'm a runner. Always have been. It's all I'm good at. So I've never had an ounce of fat on my body because I just ran it off. Going from eating once a day and having ciggarettes as meals to eating 3-4 times a day was a huge shock to my body and it still is).

So here I am today, and I dont want to eat another fucking egg. The discomfort has not gone away. I still want to puke after every breakfast. My question: Is there a definitive guide to foods and high-calorie diets for someone in my position? I am really dedicated to seeing this through and want to make it work but I just can't seem to keep the food inside of my body and not at the tip of my throat. Also, do you have any general advice, tips, comments, suggestions for me? Maybe something the FAQs dont mention. 

TLDR; I'm tall and skinny, digest everything quickly and been a runner for a large part of my life until college. Now I'm trying to gain but the foods I am eating suck and make me want to vomit. Any help?

PS: The gain I've seen so far from a weeks worth of a high-calorie diet along with a work-out plan, has centered around my stomach. None of the fat or weight is appearing elsewhere on my body. Is this normal? Will the weight distribute evenly? Can I maintain my six-pack (the only good thing about being a runner... *facepalm*)?

When I was 18 I was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis, which in the course of a year dropped me from 165 lbs. to roughly 118(with the lowest being 108lbs). Did I mention I am 5'10? Yeah, kinda thin. It got worse and I ended up having to have my entire large intestines/90% of my colon removed so now I have horrible problems absorbing nutrients which makes gaining a nightmare. 

When I mean a nightmare, I mean if I skip 3-4 meals in a week it's not uncommon for me to lose 5-10 lbs...even with water weight it's pretty severe. That being said I've spent the past year really putting effort in the gym as well as diet and I've been shown some results luckily.

Something to note: I took whey for the first month, maybe two, but hated the excessive gas and stomach trouble it gave me. So for the last 4-5 months, I have been **supplement free** (I do take a multivitamin and fish oil). 

NOTE that I am not anti-supplement. I AM against the idea that whey (or even creatine) is considered a requirement. 

I started with a 3 day split that focused on the big three lifts plus shoulder press for the first three months. That got me up to 146lbs and 135 bench, 205 squat, 250 dead. I've been on PHAT since, and have been focusing more on endurance lifting and hypertrophy. My lifts are now 180x2 bench, 225x6 squat (high bar, ass-to-grass - I'd estimate my low bar 90* 1rm squat to be around 250, maybe more), 345x10 deadlift.

I don't know what my starting bodyfat was, but I was 10.5% a few months ago and am 8.6-8.9% now. I didn't cut and I'm on 2900 cal, but newb gains definitely will let you burn fat while gaining weight.

--- 

Sample day of food:

4 eggs scrambled

2 cups chocolate almond milk (for calcium)

1 can black beans, 1/2 cup (dry) brown rice

10oz chicken breast (some days, bison burger - up to 1lb)

7oz dry roasted peanuts

-----

Other staples are steel cut oats, grape nuts cereal (with soy milk and cut up banana), peanut butter, pistachios (more of a treat), grapefruit, flounder. 

I eat a LOT of peanuts every day (at least 5 ounces), and I have black beans and rice every day. Those two account for most of my calories. Chicken most days for protein (both of the former have it, but not as much as chicken). 

I try to do 140g protein per day, but had more than a month streak where I ate about 100/day and didn't see much of a difference in gains.

[Progress Pics](http://imgur.com/a/BPq87)

**Background**: I've always been the short, skinny guy who eats anything and everything without the weight gain. I've weighed 118 +/- 2lbs since I was 16 y/o. It's never really bothered me that much but it does get irritating hearing,"" Do you even eat"",""Do you have worms"" etc...So recently I decided to make it a priority to getting into weight training to try and add some muscle and fill out before summer comes.

My goal was to be realistic for my size, body type and just gain some weight to appear more ""fit"" than ""skinny"". Being on a budget, I only had use of my apartment gym which only supplies some basic isolation machines, and a small dumbell set I had at home. I assume some of you are in this same position and only have a limited use of equipment, so I thought I'd share my limited results with what I had. In no way is my progress drastically significant, but I do feel more confident for summer and look forward to more gains now that my awesome wife surprised me with new equipment the other day!

**Routine: M/W/F**

* Incline bench 3x8
* Flat bench 3x8
* Lat Pull-Down 3x8
* Seated Cable Row 3x8
* Overhead Press 3 sets 10/8/6
* Front/Lateral dumbell raises 3x10
* Dumbell Squats
* Abs- Planks after every workout

**Diet**: I didn't keep a detailed journal because my goal at this point was just to add a few pounds. I just made sure to eat every two hours or so during the day, supplement with protein on work out days, and get at least 8 hours of sleep every night. 

Good luck to everyone on their progress and gain that weight!

* I'm tired of being skinny, how can I change it?
* Just how important *are* squats?
* I've reached a plateau, how can I get past it?

If your question is more specific to you, I recommend providing details. The more we know about your situation, the better answer we will be able to provide.

Hopefully this will help consolidate the many beginner posts we get in /r/gainit. I would also like to give a friendly reminder that the **[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index)** is considered a comprehensive guide on how to gain lean mass and has more than enough information to get any beginner started today.

Ask away!

I think it's pretty shitty progress but progress nonetheless, my diet wasn't very consistent but I'm strict about it now.  I used to eat 3k+ calories one day and barely 2.5k the next and so on.

My lifts for 5RM:
Bench: 45 -&gt; 135
Squat: 45 -&gt; 120 (taking a few weeks off since I got a knee injury)
DL: 45 -&gt; 265
OHP: 40 -&gt; 75 (this is the hardest for me to progress on)

Currently bulking on 3k - 3.2k calories a day with 160g+ protein, I supplement with 5g creatine, multi, fish oil and sometimes preworkout.

My routine starting off was pretty bad, it was a 3 day split of fuckarounditis but I've adopted this routine:
AxBxCDx

A: Chest/triceps
5x5 bench press
3x5 incline bench press
3x8 skull crushers with ez curl (+ close grip bench press)
3x8 tricep pull-downs
3xF dips

B: Back/biceps
5x5 Deadlifts
3x8 BB row
3x8 Ez-bar curls
2x10 hammer curls

5x5 Standing OHP
3x8 Upright row w/ ez-curl bar

Remember that the more you weigh, the more stress you have on your heart to supply all that tissue. Also, watch your salt while you cover your macronutrients. Sodium intake directly affects blood pressure and can fly under the radar unless you watch for it specifically.

FYI, the most current NIH guidelines for adults are as follows:

           Systolic / Diastolic
Normal: &lt;120 /(and) &lt;80

Prehypertension: 120-139 /(or) 80-89

Stage 1 HTN: 140-159 /(or) 90-99

Stage 2 HTN: &gt;160 /(or) &gt;100



Take care of yourself, and stay healthy as you are gaining. Good luck!

* **Powdered Protein**: The main staple of every shake. There are many different types (whey, cassein, soy, egg, etc.) and flavors. Buy the best deal that has the least amount of fillers and added junk. Whey is the best all-around.
* **Oats** (1/2-1 cup):  Excellent source of complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. Best take earlier in the day and before a workout. Blend separately.
* **Bananas** (1-2): A good source of simple carbohydrates and extremely tasty. Best taken post workout; tastiest when blended frozen or very cold.
* **Almonds** (handful): Good fats and a decent amount of protein. Shred them separately.
* **Peanut butter** (1-2 tbsp): Good fats, protein, lots of calories.
* **Berries** (1/2 cup): Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries... it doesn't matter. Add for taste, antioxidant, and metabo boosting properties.
* **Milk** (2 cups): Skim, 1%, 2%, whole, chocolate... whichever is best for you. Milk packs a lot of caloriesm carbs, and protein and adds great taste to any shake. Best after a workout because it can feel heavy. Can be substituted with almond milk, coconut milk, or coconut water.
* **Olive oil** (1-2 tbsp): Each tablespoon is ~100 calories and rich in good fats. Amazing, right?
* **Yogurt** (1/2 cup): Greek yogurt is especially good. It packs an excellent amount of protein and some good calories.
* **Cottage cheese** (1/2 cup): Same with most dairy. high in calories and protein, although this one is trickier to mix with.
* **Ice**: Adds that smooth coolness to any shake.

Mix and match these ingredients to create your favorite protein shake.


My own personal recipes go something like:

Pre-workout or morning shake. This is a light shake to fuel me at the gym.

* 1 cup oats
* 1 handful almonds
* 1 1/2 scoop Cytosport 100% chocolate whey
* 1 cold banana
* 6-8 oz cold water

Post Workout shake:

* 1 handful almonds
* 1-2 scoops chocolate whey
* 2 cold bananas
* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 4 oz milk or almond milk
* 4 oz water",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_swkqq,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/swkqq/master_list_of_protein_shake_ingredients/,

Now 2ndly and the most important because of lack of activity. I have barely any muscle mass and to make it worst the nearest gym is to far for me. The other problem is I have no weight and the budget requires that I put them off for now. So a natural work out plan or any ideas to use subs instead of weights would help.

Now A major problem is motivation and energy.

I can assure you i've seen some great results and I've never felt more confident or healthy in my life.

I'm a 20 year old guy.


Diet:
My main issue is that I'm not consistent, when I eat, I'll eat a lot. My goal is to get 3300 calories a day. 
I'm a student so the hardest part was making high calorie, high protein meals for cheap. I've found buying frozen chicken is a great way to do this, I'll buy a kilogram of breast fillets for £3.99 and eat 3 or 4 for each meal. Mix in some mince every now and then. 
I've always found breakfast is the hardest meal to get high calories as I usually have little time to cook. The best way I found was to make oatmeal. The recipe I go by is 1 large cup of oatmeal, 1 large cup of orange juice, a banana, raisins, almonds, tablespoon of cinnamon and sugar. It tastes pretty good and is very calorific. 
I started taking protein shakes around 2 months ago and have noticed quite a change, my dad's got a degree in exercise science and told me that they can be a huge waste of money so I wanted to test this. Not sure whether it's a placebo effect but they certainly are a great way to bring up the protein for the day, especially post workout.


In terms of my routine I operate on a four day split with abs and core spread in between and some cardio for good measure when I see fit. On mondays I'll work chest and triceps, 3x8 Incline dumbell press and 3x8 Incline dumbell flys at around 70-80% of my ORM. 5x10 Overhead tricep raises, 15-20 dips, 5x5 skullcrushers, a set of decline push ups and finish off with a chest press until failure.
Wednesday is bicep and shoulders, 5x8 concentration curls, preacher curls with an barbell and cable curls. 3x8 shoulder press, 3x8 shoulder fly and shoulder fly at an angle (not sure the name for these). Then Hammer curls and open arm curls.
Friday is leg day which is pretty much just your basic squat routine
Sunday i'll work back which is just sets of wide grip pull ups, close grip, chin ups and supermans.

3000cal a day, just dirty bulking and working out 3 times a week. 

Thanks Gainit!

Edit for info: 

So the picture was from 2 years ago, I worked out but wasn't serious about it. No routine and just worked out for the enjoyment. It was only this year that I did two things that really changed and I started seeing/caring about results - Calorie counting and working out with more of a routine.

Still, I wouldn't say I am very hard core about it. I am sure I could refine my routine but I am happy with it and I am seeing results. I only just added bench and squats (No spotter before), before I would use machines/smith.

As far as diet goes, I only started counting calories around this time last year (April 2012) and yes, 3000 every day. There would be some days I go way over, some a bit under. But I try and keep the average that way. I find if I eat any less I will instantly start losing weight. I cut a bit during December, got right back on it in January. A lot of Eggs, bacon, pasta, chicken. But also burgers, steaks, cake, whatever it took to make my 3000. Id consider myself dirty bulking only because I don't care. I usually eat what my parents make for dinner, lunch Im on my own so thats more up to me. Protein after workout, and thats it. 

Work out routine:

Day 1
Chest/Core
Dumbbell presses - 60lbs
Bench - 175lbs
Decline Smith - 185lbs
Core machine -155lbs (Rotates from Side to side)
3x30 leg raises
2x100 Hanging Situps

Day 2
Legs
Squat 185lbs 10x3 &lt;-- I feel like I can do a lot more, but I am still working on technique. 
Leg Extension Machine 90lbs 
Leg Spread Machine 290
Leg Close Machine 205
Leg Press Machine-305lbs

Day 3
Arms/Back
Shoulder Fly 22.5lbs
Preacher 27.5 6x3
Dumbbell curl 35 6x3
Back Pull Down Machine 165
Pull-ups 10x3
Chin-ups 10x3

If rep/set isn't stated it is 8x3.

As you can tell I don't have any terminology at all. I have this in my phone only to make sure I keep lifting more than I did last week, and I usually go alone. None of my friends lift so I guess Im not as ""into it"" as some people are. Some exercises I have started to replace, like the leg press machine I am hoping to replace with squats, and like I said earlier the smith press with bench press.  

Hope I don't sound too much like an idiot.

I know there are some that cannot drink regular milk or won't get lactase pills or those that cannot afford 1/2 gallon-1 gallon a day. I found a substitute called CarbMaster nonfat milk and it was on clearance.

It is nonfat though (not a problem for me), has 480 cals for 1/2 gallon, and 88 grams of protein. It has a lactase enzyme. It is made by Kroger and sold at Kroger and King Soopers.

I don't know if it hasn't been selling well in my King Soopers, but it was reduced to .99 cents and I got 4 1/2 gallons last week. I went back today and got 2 1/2 gallons for 25 cents each because they expire tomorrow (no problem). So 50 cents for 960 cals and 176 grams of protein.

Diet: Since I'm in school, was kind of hard to get a diet going. At the beginning of January I started bringing 2 Cliff bars a day to school. (480 Calories total) Eating them with the school lunch helped me a lot. Right before bed I eat 2 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (660 calories total) and sometimes like to throw in half a shot of olive oil (240 calories). Before this I was probably eating under 1,500 calories a day. After workouts I grab a protein shake for 200 calories. Still not enough calories that I'm eating daily, which I'm working on now.

If you read it you are a gem and I really appreciate it! I will bold the most important paragraphs for anyone who wants the TLDR version.

I posted on here under a different user name awhile back about gym etiquette. Basically I said there was a guy hitting on me and asked for advice. The consensus was that he is a turd who should leave me alone, and I was given some good advice on how to handle him in the future.

I'm going to reiterate a few things from that post. I love going to the gym. My lifts have gone up so much in the past eight months since I started. I'm a 5'9"" female, 143 pounds, and recently did a 1RM deadlift set of 250. My other lifts are progressing nicely, too. I started olympic lifting with a coach last month, and he has helped me a lot in terms of form for my squats and deadlifts. He has coached me proper form in assistance exercises like bench press and military press as well. I have a close circle of friends who lift, including my boyfriend who was a powerlifter in the past. This has helped me a lot as well. So while I'm  not perfect, I certainly know what I'm doing.

Going to the gym is my time to just feel awesome, be in the zone, listen to good music, and get pumped up. I'm not a total ice queen - I don't mind talking to people briefly between sets, or exchanging a nod of acknowledgement or a hello. But for the most part I think it's rude to completely interrupt people at the gym. So unless someone initiates conversation with me I don't talk to others. I expect the same courtesy be extended to me.

Anyways, in case anyone on here goes to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada, that is where I currently workout. It's a pretty crowded gym most days, and mostly guys workout in the weights area. Consequently I am very used to getting looked at. But it's usually respectful enough that people don't stare or linger around too long. 

**I usually don't ask people to spot me on the bench press, mostly because every time I do they take it as an invitation to hit on me. I wish people could just respectfully spot me and leave when the set it over. Two days ago I'm sitting at the bench, and just finished a set of 5. This guy comes up and says ""do you want a spotter? I saw you benching and thought you might want one"". I initially thought this was kind of nice, and agreed. Then he does the first thing that pisses me off - tries to tell me my form and breathing are wrong. Now look... I'm not so hardheaded that I refuse to admit I'm wrong. But I've been training for 8 months, one of which is with an olympic coach who is a 7x canadian national champion. While I've been perfecting my form for months, this dude clearly has no idea what he is doing (tried telling me to squat using a smith machine - LOL). So I said to myself ""okay just get this set over with and then he will leave"". Wrong. He took the liberty to offer his ""services"" and spot me for the next 3 sets after that. Not only that, but he stuck around and didn't go back to his workout. So I had to sit there and talk to him during my break, which I usually use to listen to music and think. Let me make something clear - even if I was single, I wouldn't be interested in him.**

**Today, two days later, I was at the bench press and GUESS WHO I SEE? Dude offers to spot me again, thinking he is being super generous. I agreed thinking it might be different today, but he did the same old shit trying to coach my form and tell me what to do. What really pisses me off most about this is how he's formed a bunch of opinions about me without having any idea what my life is like. He assumes because I am female that I have no knowledge of lifting. He told me not to curve my back because I was going to injure it, and tried to get me to bench with my grip as wide as his, when he is taller than me and obviously my wing span is much smaller. He is just an overall bum.**

**Then I go over to do pull ups and he FOLLOWS ME OVER THERE! I had my hand across my chest changing the music on my ipod and he tapped me on the shoulder and was like ""you all right?"" I'm like ""uhh.. yeah?"" he's like ""oh you looked like you were in pain"". We exchange a few more awkward words and I get back on for my next set. After that set I was standing there and I could see him approaching out of the corner of my eye and hopped up for the next set prematurely. After that it hit me - I was changing my workout for this douche, and his presence was making me VERY uncomfortable.**

**To top it all off, he asked me what I was doing the rest of this week, and told me he was going to a Christmas party tomorrow. I believe the only reason he didn't ask me to go with him is because I said I was going to Toronto (only half true... I'm actually going to Toronto in two days to fly home for Christmas).**

I might think differently in thirty years when I am in my fifties and no longer receive this kind of male attention, but for now it really pisses me off and I have no idea how to handle it. Like, I've done everything I can do. And I don't believe I need to tell everyone that talks to me that I have a boyfriend just to avoid getting this kind of unwanted attention. I think it should be common courtesy not to hit on a woman while she is trying to workout, regardless of whether you know if she is single.

So... **I guess I'm asking this community which is predominantly made up of men - how do you think I should handle this?** My two main issues are 1. that this assclown thinks it's okay to interrupt my workout and hit on me and 2. that he tries to correct me while knowing nothing about me and while knowing nothing about lifting himself.

I don't want to be mean to people. But I don't know where to draw the line - like I can't see any point today when I could have intervened and gotten him to leave me alone. I ended my workout early just to get away from him. I have entertained the idea of wearing a fake wedding ring to the gym, but I'm not even sure if that's something people in my age demographic look for when hitting on a woman. Also wearing a ring while lifting would be uncomfortable. I graduate in four months then I'm moving on to law school somewhere new, so this really isn't an issue much longer thank goodness.

This post isn't about that.  This post is for those just new to gainit (like me) that sit down with the gym director and are faced with three options:

* $42/mo for 12 months
* $39/mo for 18 months
* $36/mo for 24 months

Regardless of whether it's a gym, a cell phone contract, or (cough) a relationship, I don't like signing up for anything for two years.  On the other hand, we're spending a LOT of money on food every month, and savings are good.  So what to do?

First, read the contract completely, especially the area about the additional rights to cancellation.  Usually the last paragraph on the back will discuss this.  They make it hard to do this on purpose.  Almost every time there will be a line in there like this: ""[You may void the contract] if you move either your residence or your place of employment more than twenty-five miles from any health club operated by the seller or a substantially similar health club which will accept the seller's obligation under the contract.""

If you wish to void your contract, find a relative or friend, hopefully within the same state as you, that doesn't live within 25 miles of one of their clubs.  Go online to the USPS official change of address page and, for $1, change your address to your relative/friend's place.

The contract requires proof of movement, so you need either a driver's license displaying your new address or a utility bill at that new address.  In my state, Massachusetts, they don't issue new driver's licenses, and instead instruct you to create a ""change of address"" label and show you how to print/fill out yourself.  Slap a label on your license, bring in the receipt of your change of address form, you can now void your contract without penalty.

The next day, change your address back.  Buy your friend a 6-pack for the help.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,tier1,True,t3_13o9gs,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/13o9gs/worried_about_your_gym_contract/,

My only excess income that I can spend would be that from my mTurk services. (Amazon Turk) - Which only nets me $100 a month or $50 per two weeks and that's if I'm being diligent.

I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on what meals to buy for consistent intake. My biggest problem was not being able to be consistent, I would do grocery and would never pick-it up after 2 weeks. I'm only 5'3 and 110 lbs, yes I'm playing life in extra hardcore lol.

1. Eggs 2. Milk are on my list, I would probably need to do some price-check shopping. I live in suburban west coast and a Dollar Tree, Walgreens, Vons and Valiarta are my shops. (Dollar Tree being the nearest and cheapest). They also have canned goods, should I think of getting these every x2 weeks?

2. I have 10-20 pound dumbells, jump ropes, 5lb leg weights, access to pull up bars, perfect push-ups. Protein shakes and energy shakes. Again, problem is consistency...

3. For GOMAD, a gallon of milk is under $10 here or $6 for half it's size. I wonder how I could even pull it off since 2 weeks of these will basically be my salary.

Or if anyone can kindly link me a post or sub that can help me out. I think there was one frugalmeals? but couldn't locate it. I'm also finding out ways to try to gain extra income, so don't burn me life is hard enough.

Thanks very much. Hopefully this can also help out people living in such status. We need to at least look decent to continue fighting :P",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_13dxcc,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/13dxcc/budget_gain_food_for_the_poor_100_a_month_possible/,
1351914645.0,21,self.gainit,12ju1c,My Gainit Stratagems,star_pilot,31,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/12ju1c/my_gainit_stratagems/,"Quick post about what I've done as a skinny guy (borderline-underweight BMI most of my life) to gain mass. In six months I went from 120 lb to 150 lb while adopting a Starting Strength regimen, mostly lean body mass (muscle, tendon, bone) but also some fat of course. I'm by no means an expert, but in the six months I've learned a lot about how to eat a lot practically (not cooking constantly or carrying tupperware everywhere) and hope that some of it is useful to others.

**Will add calorie/protein amounts later**

**Starting Out**

Initially, it's hard to eat a lot. Your current appetite probably reflects a sedentary person's metabolism, not a weightlifter's. As you build muscle you'll need more maintenance calories just to not feel hungry, and right after workouts you should have a voracious appetite. Don't be frustrated if you can't eat 3,500 calories on day 1. Your appetite will grow dramatically as you gain muscle.

**Recipes**

These aren't the only things I eat, but they're meals that I've found especially convenient and calorie dense.

Gainer Meat Slop

Silverhydra's slop is great but intended for weight loss/maintenance. The cabbage is low-calorie stomach filler (competitive eaters eat it to distend their stomachs) that a gainer could replace with more calories. My version drops the cabbage for beans and replaces the processed red meat with whole chicken.

- 2 lb chicken breasts/thighs
- 1 c dry black beans
- 2 c kale
- 2 red onions
- 2 carrots
- 2 bell peppers
- 28 oz (1 can) crushed tomatoes

Optional

- 8 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp cayenne
- ½ tbsp thyme
- ½ tbsp fresh basil
- salt, pepper, goya sazon to taste

Dump in a big pot, cook until beans are soft and have absorbed most of the liquid. Break apart chicken if you wish, it should be tender.

Tim Ferriss's Tuna Chili Mac

Ferriss uses this super quick meal to pack in calories and protein: wheat macaroni + can of tuna + can of turkey chili. More details at http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/timothyf.htm ctrl/⌘-f for ""favorite meal""

Post-Workout Shake

- 1 banana
- 3 c milk, 1% or skim if my waistline exceeds 33""
- 1 scoop protein powder (ON Gold Standard Natural Chocolate)
- ¼ c mixed frozen berries
- 1 tbsp almond butter
- 1 tsp creatine

I don't actually measure the amounts (I really use a ""pad"" of almond butter on a knife); these are estimates coming from a guy who cooks a fair amount.

My morning shakes consist of just milk, protein powder, and a tablespoon of instant coffee for taste. I use decaf but you can use regular to provide a kick (add some sweetener and it tastes a lot like a bottled frappuccino). I put it in the fridge overnight. Also, get a 28 oz BlenderBottle® (Amazon, any nutrition store); the little ball helps mix so much

Breakfast

- 1 c plain rolled oats
- 0.8 c water

Optional: mashed up banana, frozen berries, fresh fruit, brown sugar, cinnamon, bit of salt

Microwave 2 minutes, serve with tall glass of milk

**Protein Snacks**

These are protein-dense and require little preparation. Some work well for eating inconspicuously throughout the day, others are great for a bedtime snack if you feel slightly not-full.

- Almonds, peanuts (roasted, unsalted. Roasted I think is easier to digest and tastes better, encouraging one to eat more.)
- Canned tuna, sardines. I often eat these right after my main dinner meal, taste good on their own but also on crackers.
- Canned chili
- Greek yogurt
- Cottage cheese (watch out for the fat)
- Protein bars (Pure Protein chocolate peanut butter 31 g are my favorite, lots of protein and not much sugar, order by the dozen on Amazon)
- Milk, protein shakes

On a non-workout day I'll start off with a protein shake brought in from home, and a few handfuls of nuts throughout the day at work. On workout days (MWF) I'll skip the morning shake and munch on the nuts, and have a protein bar (31 g) before leaving work (5 pm), which is right before I work out. These bars are pretty filling, preventing hunger pangs during my workout, but it's not so much that I cramp. 

**On Milk**

I started with whole milk, but after five weeks of 1 gallon every 4 days or so, I was at 19% bodyfat (measured by hydrostatic test). [Rippetoe recommends](http://i.imgur.com/4mF5v.png) staying below 20%, so I switched to 1% and have used mostly that. Lower-fat milk is *much* less filling than whole but contains a similar proportion of protein. Skim goes down like water almost, and if you just want protein and not fat, consider having some with every meal. Going with whole means you'll be able to drink less of it, and will shift your protein-fat intake to more fat, less protein. Keep that in mind when deciding which type of milk to drink.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,,True,t3_12ju1c,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/12ju1c/my_gainit_stratagems/,

And if anyone wants to guess my body fat percentage, that'd be great.

So my goal right now is to get down to a body fat level at which I can really see my abs (so like 8-10%). How much weight do I need to lose to make this happen? I'm only 165, so I'm really afraid to lose weight after putting in so much hard work to put it on. I don't want to look tiny again.

Also, anyone who's cut down to low body fat levels, did you do anything special to get there?

About 6 months ago I got fed up with my body and decided I would do something about it. I was 6 feet tall and weighed about 120 lbs. I was being picked on just about every other day by my friends about how skinny I was. This sparked my first interest in going to the gym to gain weight. After a newly acquired membership at my local overpriced gym, I failed at going regularly and just put my whole goal on the back burner for a bit. 

Fast forward two months and my new semester was just starting. That's when my life changed. I took this body conditioning class that my high school offered and started seeing results almost immediately. Our routine was quite simple: Monday = shoulder's, biceps. Tuesday = cardio (goal of 5 km by the end of the semester) Wednesday = legs, back. Thursday = cardio  Friday = chest, tricept. Within a few days I noticed my appetite exploding and being extremely tired as soon as I got home. 

Now, after 2 months of daily exercise I weigh 140 lbs and am very happy with my new body. Sorry for the long story, I am just happy to find a community that shares the same goal as I do.

However, I wanted to show you a before and after pic of my 3 1/2 month workout plan I did in Spain last year. 

  This is what I looked like last March.  I was about 140lbs.

http://imgur.com/cOjivf4

This is me after three months 5x a week in the gym.  175lbs.  The weight I'm holding is about the same amount of weight I gained during those three months.

http://imgur.com/EWkybnc

I'm posting this for you guys showing that no matter how thin you are, you can easily put on weight and also for myself so I know what I did do and what I can accomplish again now that I'm back in the states.  

I never thought I would be able to put on weight (or even have muscles) because of how fast my metabolism is.

My workout was a pretty basic 5x a week plan:
Monday: Chest and Triceps
Tuesday: Back and Biceps
Wednesday:  Shoulders, Traps, and (sometimes) deadlifts
Thursday: Legs
Friday: Chest and arms again (an easier all-over workout than mon-tues)

As for food, my basic rule was to eat everything I possibly could as well as take protein shakes 3x a day.  I also didn't drink alcohol on Weekdays.

  Protein Shake was ""Serious Mass"".  I didn't measure out the milk but I had a very large beer mug I would mix everything in along with 2 Tbsp. olive oil, a banana, a large scoop of vanilla (sometimes chocolate) ice cream and then fill the rest of the mug up with whole milk.

  Just the shakes themselves 3x a day was enough calories for a day.  IIRC, it was about 4k a day just the shakes.

   My pre-workout was Jack3D but I think that got discontinued/outlawed?  It was still available in Spain, however...

  I was also taking daily vitamins.  I don't remember what they were called, though.  (They were from GNC)

  My daily food looked like:

Wake up at 8am - Shake, Cereal, banana, orange, and daily vitamins
10am - PBJ and another banana
Lunch- Leftovers from night before*
        - about 45 mins later a PBJ
2 pm- Chicken Fried Rice + fruit
4pm- Workout
** Right after workout, I would go home and take a cold shower while eating another PBJ and a banana.  The gym was right next to my house so it only took me like 2 mins to walk there.  Then, about 20mins after the workout, I would take another shake.**
7pm- Dinner
9/10pm - Another Shake and leftovers from dinner

*There was about 10 of us in the house I was living in and every week we would alternate making food for the entire house.  Living in Spain, we had a High protein/high carb diet (usually consisting of Pasta and Chicken).  There were always leftovers so I would just eat that the next day.  

  So now that I am back home, I am going to the gym again and doing the same workout routine.  I will post a before soon so you can get an idea of what I look like now after coming back from Africa.  I'm excited to see how I look in 6 months if I could do that in 3.

  If there is anything else you would need to know, don't be afraid to ask.

I'll share my 2-month [progress] inside (109lb to 129lb and counting)",AnotherDayAlone,31,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/15esav/good_weight_for_short_people_im_56_also_when/,"Oh hi.

My goal weight used to be 140lb but I'm almost 130lb now and still seem quite skinny. I think I'm going to set my new goal at 150lb. Any fellow shorties here that can comment at which weight you started looking ""swole""?

A little about me (edit: I actually wrote a lot more than I intended and unintentionally shared my progress) before I ask my 2nd question: 

**PROGRAM**: I began the Practical Programming novice program about 2 months ago because I heard it's great for gaining strength and mass quickly. After carefully reading Starting Strength, I purchased a Powertec power cage and 300lb Olympic barbell set. One of the best investments I ever made (both the book and the equipment). 

**DIET**: I weighed only 109lb at the start so I wasn't very worried about my diet at that point. So I ate dirty, caring only about getting in a lot of calories and not being skinny for the first time in my life.

But the last 2 weeks, I've been very determined to eat clean. Now, I mainly eat home-cooked foods consisting of: 

* veggies (sometimes cheat with v8 juice)
* eggs
* lean meats (fattiest I eat now would be lean ground beef) or fish (the fattier, the better)
* whole milk (I try not to drink more than 2 cups a day. After drinking about 6 cups a day at the start, I gained a lot of water weight, especially could see/feel my hands become bloated, and I just felt really unhealthy)
* cheese
* oats/cereal/brown rice (I try to eat no more than 3 cups a day ever since I read ""Wheat Belly"". Keeping my carbs low now and might even eliminate wheat completely--after I gain mass of course)
* 1-2 tbsp peanut butter (going to switch to a healthier organic version later)
* 3-4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
* I plan to add almonds/cashews into my diet very soon (loads of calories, good fats).

I've been averaging about 2500 calories a day on this clean diet. If my weight gain slows, I definitely plan to up this amount.

**PROGRESS**: In terms of body weight, I gained 20lb in about 2 months. On my clean diet, I gained 2lb just last week.

(Sorry, no pics. I wish I took a pic in the beginning to see how much I progressed. It doesn't seem like much when I merely look in the mirror...)

As for my lifts, I won't bother to mention my starting numbers because they were very low when I was (and still am) learning correct form. Including it would make it seem like I got stronger than I actually did so I don't want to give the wrong impression.

All numbers are 3x5 unless stated otherwise.

* Squats: 160lb. I actually got to 190lb before I did a major deload because I re-aggravated a damn groin injury early on. Funny thing is just last week, I finally knew how to do a proper squat.
* Deadlift: 1x5 220lb. Starting to get a little heavy, might need to try supinating my grip on heavy sets soon. Or pick up some chalk.
* Bench: 120lb
* Press: 65lb. Another lift in which the light bulb finally went on quite recently. This feels easy now when I once struggled with a lower weight.
* Barbell curls: 3x8 55lb (I added curls about a week ago, couldn't help it!)
* Chin-ups: 10, 7, 7 reps. Chins and pulls have stalled a lot.
* Pull-ups: 8, 7, 5 reps
* Dips: 12, 12, 12 reps. Increasing reps every week until I buy a dip belt.
* Abs: Nothing yet. I see a thin layer of fat where I once could see abs so I do plan to do crunches or something. Suggestions?
* Cardio: HIIT jump rope 3 days a week on off-days

**Next Program?** My goal has always been aesthetics (so I'm probably going to set my sights on a hypertrophy program next like PHAT) but I knew I had to put on mass first.

Should I wait until I reach my goal weight AND all my lifts stall about 3x? This is the lengthiest option and not one I am keen on. I like my strength gains but remember, my goal is size.

Should I move on when I'm near my goal weight, say, 140lb?

Something else?

However, I have **really** let things slide over the years. I've taken a look at Starting Strength and some of the other programs, and I have a sinking feeling that I need to work on some core stability and overall ""fitness"" before I can even consider using weights.

How screwed up am I exactly?

When I bend over and attempt to touch my toes, the tips of my fingers barely go past my knees.

I have severe shoulder impingement, so when I do a pushup, my shoulders click and hurt.

My wrists are extremely delicate and I can't really get a stable grip on anything heavy without hurting them.

My hips/leg joints also click and hurt when I do things like squats.

When I do crunches, my lower back gives out waaay before my abs start feeling anything.

I can jog for approximately 15 minutes before I start seeing spinning halos in the center of my vision and have to stop.


...

I hope I've managed to convey exactly how un-fit I feel. I really don't feel like I need to be building strength when my body is this shitty. Do any of you have recommendations for the ultimate, basic, physical-therapy-ish workout plans?

If I were to rate my goals, I'd go with the following, in order:

1. Stop being out-of-breath from stairs and long walks

2. Stop having random joint pain in the middle of the day from simple things like sitting or standing in one position for more than a few minutes

3. ""Feel"" fit - not necessarily build muscle mass immediately, but feel healthy, energetic, flexible, ""fit""

4. Lastly, build muscle mass once I stabilize my absolutely craptastic core

5. 1 medium onion diced

7. 1 lb chopped ham, or chicken thighs, I switch off or add both at times.

I get my brown rice cooking. I slice my sausage into thin slices and brown both sides. This is optional but I prefer the texture this way. Place these in a separate bowl and then brown your ham. If I do chicken I usually just throw it on the grill. Add this to your sausage. Add two-three tbsp olive oil and sautee your onions and jalapenos. Now follow the prep directions for the Jambalaya mix. Essentially it's just bringing 4 cups of water to a boil and then adding the mix plus your meat, and the two cans of rotel. Bring to a boil again, reduce heat to a simmer, cover for 25-30 minutes. Once this finishes cooking I add my brown rice and mix everything together.

Hey guys! I thought I'd post the modest progress I made before my injury. At the end of last month I broke my arm arm wrestling of all things. I won the first round with my right hand but wasn't as successful with my left. The twisting motion caused [a complex fracture in my left humerus](http://i.imgur.com/hLJVmN8.jpg), and because it was the beginning of consecutive holidays here in Japan, I had to wait three days with a broken arm before any doctors were available to perform surgery. It took [a metal plate, nine bolts and twenty three staples](http://i.imgur.com/9E6TB7D.jpg) to patch me up, and now, two weeks later, I'm well on my way to making a full recovery. Thankfully I'm a natural righty so besides having to learn how to put in contact lenses one-handed, I haven't had much difficulty coping with the temporary loss of a limb in my everyday life.

While I was in the hospital I lost around 5kg and I've already noticed a significant decrease in the size of my upper body. I've gone to the gym a few times to commit murder on my legs/abs but doing bodyweight squats and incline situps just isn't the same. I'm a shadow of my former self without a barbell in my life. The doctor says it'll be another couple months before I can step into the squat rack again, so in the meantime I was hoping some of you gainit fitness gurus would have some recommendations/words of encouragement for me to keep gaining while recovering from a broken arm. Any advice would be much appreciated.


Edit: Sorry if the stats seem a bit wonky. For clarification, while I was doing GOMAD for ~6 weeks, my TDEE was probably closer to 3500. I started noticing lots of fat gain and stopped. My starting lifts are so low because I was more focused on form than lifting heavy. My OHP and bench are still low because my form with those lifts are crap at heavier weights, dead is high because I was using straps. Again, all of these are my best 3 sets of 5 reps, not 1RM.

I wanted to get into gaining weight while I was with my girlfriend but it was rough times and I found it hard to commit and really get stuck in. So I started going 4/5 times a week, eating as much as I could and getting focused. I'm pleased with the progress I've made so far, as you can tell from the photos its not anything amazing but I feel better and I think I look a little better to (each to their own opinion though)

Eating:

I have not been taking supplements yet although I will be starting on whey protein within the next couple of weeks and possibly creatine (thoughts on that?) also was looking at Dianabol but could do with some advice and help with that too.

I eat pretty clean - Cut out the crap: no fizzy drinks, no fast food, no crisps etc. I drink alcohol sometimes but only on a night out with friends at university. Work is picking up so my alcohol consumption is low. I've also cut down on smoking a lot to where I maybe have a couple a week but that will soon fade out as well.

Things I eat: lots of milk - chocolate milk is great, semi skimmed milk. Oats in the morning and a banana. Lunch usually chicken pasta, tuna pasta or chicken or tuna sandwich or if im home i'll have eggs, bacon, sausage etc. Dinner is usually chicken or fish based but will mix it up with friend eggs on tuna pasta just for the extra protein. I dont track my diet too much i just eat everything as it comes and THINK about what I eat before it goes in my mouth :p

There are plenty of other diet plans out their for everyone and I wouldn't typically recommend GOMAD people who are looking to bulk without fat.

However, I've noticed GOMAD has come up a lot and people have been struggling with getting down a gallon of milk off the bat.

I first tried GOMAD 2 years ago for about a month. It worked well. I put on about 5 kg (11lb) and I definitely looked bigger. [Since then I've cut a bit due to high cardio sports - been happy with the physique but looking to bulk again.]

When I first started what I first noticed was the bloating, stomach pain and the diarrhea. So much time wasted on the toilet. Anyway, I kept at it and the sickness passed.

Since then I've tried GOMAD a couple times and couldn't get through a week. I felt incredibly sick and couldn't stand the taste of milk without wanting to vomit and then proceed with evacuating my bowels.

About a month ago, I've tried to get back onto GOMAD with an alternative progression to ease my stomach into it.

At moment I'm just about getting a gallon in, including meals, and so far so good (about 2 kg / 5 lb) with no bloating/diarrhea. 



My plan has been as follows:

Week 1: 1 L (1/4 Gallon) of milk + 1 L of coconut/almond/oat milk

Week 2: 1.5 (or 2) L of milk + 1.5 L of coconut/almond/oat almond/oat milk

Week 3: 2 (or 3) L of milk + 1 L coconut/almond/oat milk

Week 4 and onwards: 4 L (1 Gallon) of milk



The idea is to slowly accustom your stomach to the lactose *and* to get your body used to consuming so much liquid. It will take a bit longer but you'll feel less like (and need to do less) shit.

The reason for coconut/almond/oat milk? It has the general consistency of milk and has a decent amount of calories.

Obviously, you can change it up to suit your needs but overall it has helped me definitely getting down that gallon.

**TL;DR** Slowly progress into GOMAD with milk alternatives and build your way up.",,False,,t5_2s9bg,False,,tier1,True,t3_zd6e4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/zd6e4/a_plan_for_getting_into_gomad/,

It will also be a ton easier to force a few extra spoonfuls in when I have a real goal for what I want to get to that day instead of just ""eat more!""

Basically I just want to look not so skeleton-like. I want to fill out my clothing (but not rip them apart, lol). So /GainIt, what should I do?

*****

In the last contest, we only had a few ""bulkers"" finish - and there were some very good results in that group.

In an effort to show that gaining weight can give you very impressive aesthetic gains (and I know it can - take it from this previously-lanky, undernourished nerd that took on 1/2 GOMAD and Starting Strength), I'd like to extend an invitation to this subreddit to participate. I know that there is an apparent aesthetic bias towards losing fat - the judging panel will make every effort to accommodate bulking success.  

If we get enough people bulking, we may even create a category for bulk-only submissions.

Started heavy weight and gain diet on July 1st. But was working out for a couple months before that (lighter weights and cardio, no gain diet). 

Anyways somewhere in early June I thought I injured my left pec. However I'm not sure, I never remember hurting it or anything and it is fine when lifting. But when I touch it, it is tender and has a bruising pain. But this is only on the nipple. The nipple is puffed out as well, and my entire left pec is developing differently than my right. This pain has gone on for 2 months now. Like I said, no trouble lifting or any pain any other time except for touching nipple area. Very sensitive. I thought stopping bench and doing free weights for chest would help with the development issue. Been doing this 2 weeks now, trying to be patient.

Does anyone know what's going on with my pec/nipple? This is my main concern because of the touching pain. I would also like to know if it has anything to do with my chest development? Please help! Thank you.

There are a lot of people who claim to have gained more than this in shorter periods of time, I think one of the more famous cases of rapid muscle gain is Christian Bales transformation between the machinist and batman begins, if we take wikipedia as a source it is stated he gained 45kg/100 pounds in 6 months, which is over 4 pounds a week, substantially higher than the limits commonly stated, whilst obviously a portion of this must be body fat, it is undeniable that a large amount of it is lean muscle mass when you see photos of bale at the time of filming.

Even in my own experience a gain of 1-2 pounds per week with only a small increase in bf was achievable when training, eating and supplementing correctly, though it was expensive to maintain this progress.

What I'm hoping we can do in this thread is discuss the evidence in support of/opposition to the commonly accepted limits here, hopefully with more of an input than a one sentence reply that explains these gains away as newbie gains, steroid use or getting fat.

I'm 22y, 180cm tall and currently doing SS after having started lifting with SL in October 2012 and got from 71kg to 79kg without problems. I had some breaks of several weeks, but now I have time to lift without interruptions and in general I'm happy with the results so far. 


My max Numbers for 3x5 are ~70kg Benchpress, ~85kg Squat, 40kg OHP, 38kg Power Clean (just started this year), 100kg Deadlift. My starting point was the bar with everything.


**My problem**: my legs (thighs) have grown freakishly fast and they are already bigger than I want them to be. I like skinny jeans and slim pants and right now I can't pull them off anymore (literallly), as my thighs are too big. I know most of you will find it hard to relate to my problem, but I'm only lifting for aesthetical reasons and right now I'd rather have my legs get a bit slimmer again while concentrating on my chest and arms. If anyone cares: I used to rock Levi's 510 like a boss, now they just look stupid - in any size.


**The question**: do you think it's reasonable to only squat every second day while keeping the linear increase of 2.5kg and maybe replace it with something chest-related? Or change the routine completely for something less squat-dependent? I already deloaded my squat-weight, but I'm not really confident it will change anything, as it's obviously getting heavier each workout.

I used to be skinny for nearly 8 years now and tried many things to gain weight.

Visited the clinic once because of it and just asked several questions about my diet, wasn't tested after it. They told me, that I was pretty normal and should just eat a bit more.

Well, the amount I used to eat was and is above average, but I wasn't drinking much - maybe 1L a day, sometimes less, rarely more.

Now I started to approach GOMAD a week ago. Currently I'm drinking 2-3L (1L = 1/4 gallon) milk a day plus try to stick at the three hours rule.

Now this may be a bit indelicate:
My dejection was very light in color on the first 2-3 days and mostly I had diarrhea. I drank 3-4L liter milk those days.

Now my first question: Is it possible, that I can't handle GOMAD or is it just the sudden change in diet, that my body couldn't adapt as fast as I wanted?

My second question may be already answered a couple of times, but I didn't find something, which fits my body characteristics:
Should I already start lifting? I'm really skinny and I don't think that I can gain muscle with the amount of ""fat"" I got, but I'm not a specialist ofc.

My goal is to reach 185 lbs, but I know, that I won't achieve that in just 2 months, this will be a long run, though I want to work hard for it to reach it someday.
However: Is it possible to gain 20 lbs in a month for me? I know, that this is different from human to human, but still, is there any number I can surely surpass, if I'm strictly holding onto my new diet?

I present to you, a wall of text:


I'm looking for some feedback on my training program, since I want to optimize it as much as possible, just like everyone else ;)


First off, some info on me: Im 22 years old, 192 cm (nearly 6'4) and 81,5 kg (180 lb). I'm studying and I have gym on campus, and I got time to train pretty much every day. My goal, as of now, is to gain mass. I'm not going to that huge size, but more aesthetics. But that won't be necessary to worry about for some years :D


I went to the gym for 2 months last summer on a 5x5 fullbody program, but it didn't stick. 

As of 2nd january, I started a new program with lots of dedication. I have been on my program for 5 weeks straight now, though bachelorthesis and sickness, proving to myself that time for gym is something you take, not something you get. So I'm quite new to all this bodybuilding stuff, but I have been lurking on reddit since late december, gathering a lot of good information and watching a lot of Kai videos ;)


I were at 77,5 kg (170,8 lb) when i started this new program. I also started taking creatine, so that might have increased my waterweight. [This picture](http://imgur.com/QX2gwn2.jpg) shows my progress.


The program is a slight modification of [Dough's Mass Building Routine for Ectomorphs](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/dougs-mass-building-routine-for-ectomorphs.html), which is a 4-split program. The program suggest training on monday + tuesday and then again thursday + friday. This leaves wednesday + the weekend for offdays. I picked this program, because the description seems to fit well on my situation.


	

The program:

Day 1, Chest and Triceps:

| Exercise   | Sets         |     Reps     |Approx. weight |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Barbell Bench Press       |          4|     8-10   | 52.5 kg / 115 lb |  
| Incline Dumbbell Bench Press  |    4|  8-10 | 18.5 kg / 40 lb  |
| Dumbbell Flys       |        3|   10-12     | 9 kg / 20 lb |
|Close Grip Bench Press | 4 | 8-10 | 30 kg / 66 lb |
|Skull Crushser | 2 | 8-10 | 22.5 kg / 50 lb |
|Dips (with assist as of now) | 2 | 8-10 | 5 kg / 11 lb assist |



Day 2, Back and Biceps:

| Exercise   | Sets         |     Reps     |Approx. weight |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Bent Over Dumbbell Rows | 4 | 8-10 | 24 kg / 53 lb |
| Pulldowns | 4 | 10-12 | 51 kg / 112.5 lb |
| Cable Reverse Grip Rows | 4 | 8-10 | 20.5 kg / 45 lb |
| Standing Barbell Curl | 4 | 6-8 | 25 kg / 55 lb |
| Alternate Seated Dumbbell Curl | 2 | 8-10 | 9 kg / 20 lb|
| Concentration Curl | 2 | 8-10 | 8 kg / 17 lb |



Day 3, Quads and Hamstrings:

| Exercise   | Sets         |     Reps     |Approx. weight |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|Squat | 4 | 8-10 | 72.5 kg / 160 lb |
| 45 Degree Leg Press | 3 | 6-8 | 180 kg / 400 lb |
| Hack Squat | 3 | 8-10 | 50 kg / 110 lb |
| Romanian Deadlifts | 3 | 6-8 | 80 kg / 177 lb |
| Leg Curl | 3 | 8-10 | 15.8 kg / 35 lb |



Day 4, Shoulders and Calves:

| Exercise   | Sets         |     Reps     |Approx. weight |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Seated Dumbbell Press | 3 | 8-10 | 18.5 kg / 40 lb |
| Seated Barbell Press | 3 | 8-10 | 25 kg / 55 lb|
| Dumbbell Lateral Raise | 3 | 10-12 | 5-6 kg / 11-13 lb |
| Barbell Shrug | 4 | 8-10 | 80 kg / 177 lb | 
| Standing Calf Raise | 3 | 12-15 | 52 kg / 115 lb |
| Seated Calf Raise | 3 | 6-8 | 35 kg / 77 lb|



I'm trying to stay in the upper bound on reps, and I always push for one more rep if I feel the power is there. I try to focus on the mind-muscle connection, and I try to make the movements slow and controlled. It's very hard to not ego lift, but I'm doing good ;)



The diet:

If you take a look at the [picture](http://imgur.com/QX2gwn2.jpg) of my weight progress, you will notice that the weight goes up on the weekends and then comes a bit down on gymdays. So I'm seeing good program, but of cause I also gain some fat. I used a friends body impedance measuring thing, which shows [this](http://i.imgur.com/DV7mYjN.jpg). I'm aware of the fact that these gadgets can't be trusted on the actual bf%.

I have tried to calculate my BMR, but it ranges a lot from site to site.

I have very little appetite, so I'm just trying to get 3000 calories each day. Before I started going to gym I had no problems having days with just one meal (maybe 1000 calories a day). So the hardest part about dieting for me, is clearly getting enough calories needed for a bulk.

I'm using MyFitnessPal to track everything, and the set macros are 50% carbs, 25% protein, and 25% fat. This results in 188 g protein, 83 g fat, and 240 g carbs.





My questions to you guys:



- What's you 2 cents ?



- Should I go with a fullbody or 2-split as I see suggested for most starters? or should I maybe follow this program without a single offday (day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4, day 1....)?


- The program I'm using suggest abs training on day 1+3 or 2+4. I'm not sure what to train there, so I'm just doing different exercises for 4 sets to failure. Can anyone suggest some good core training that doesn't take too long, since it will most likely be in the end of the workout?

So here's the gist of things, I'm a 19 year old freshman running cross country and track at a D3 university and have been running since about middle school. Currently, I'm about 5'9'' and 120lbs and I want to gain weight. I've been skinny my whole life and I've been trying to gain for a while because my BMI is pretty low and my doctor has been advising me to gain weight for the last couple years. The problem is, I've tried everything. I've tried drinking high-calorie milkshakes and protein-based whey shakes and I drink whole milk on the regular. I'm a vegetarian so naturally my diet doesn't have much fat. At our dining halls, food is served in entree style but I always get snacks during the day (i.e. mozzarella sticks, muffin) to make sure I'm full but I haven't put on a pound of the so called freshman 15.

I carry almost all of my weight in my butt and legs (with a bit in my breasts), leaving me with skeletal arms and no fat on my stomach. People tell me all the time I am too thin and need to gain weight. I don't feel like I need any more fat (people just don't see it because it's all on my lower body), but my BMI is technically unhealthy (I know, I know, barely) so I am planning on trying to put on some muscle. As of last week, I cut out most of my running and started strength training 5 days a week. I also started tracking my calories and am aiming for 250-500 calories above maintenance a day and 130 grams of protein. I keep finding myself slightly under measuring all of my portions (I document half a cup of oatmeal, but will only pour myself what is likely more like 4/10th of a cup), and incredibly loathe to go above 250 calories extra a day (I'll get to 230 and say that is good enough). I think this is because I am afraid of putting on unnecessary excess fat. I would like to put on some muscle: I would love for people to stop harassing me about my weight and would probably feel better about my body if everything were ""firmer"", but I have this fundamental fear of getting fat.

I guess I am just looking for support. Has anyone else been in this situation? If so, how did you overcome it? I'm sorry this post is so vague but eating disorders ""run"" in my family (all of my aunts are either anorexic or bulimic and my sister doesn't have an eating disorder but diets obsessively to be stick thin) so I guess I am a little concerned about my difficulty in this area, even though I'm not really worried about becoming anorexic. I would greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you.

I searched FAQs and past posts, but couldn't find anything to answer my questions (apologies if either questions have been answered to death already..). First, I'm signed up for my work gym (much cheaper than any of the other gyms out there, and I like being the only person in the gym most of the time), which is very limited on leg machines.

Any advice would be really appreciated.

I also wanted to get your take on your rest days in regards to eating. Do any of you change your eating habits at all? I remember reading somewhere that it's still important to eat a lot of calories since your body is still in recovery mode even when you're not working out. That said, do any of you change your eating habits at all?

It was at the point of not wanting to wear short sleeved tops, which explains the poor selection of before photos. So for that I have chucked in pictures of me in two tops with me at roughly the same size as what I was four months ago - followed by current photos in the same tops.
 
I thought I should do something about it back in feb, but because I had a really busy lifestyle I didn't have the time to take it seriously (so never done anything), so I decided in the summer I would do something about it, when I had some time and money. For the 2 years before I started lifting weights I had done virtually no exercise. 

So on the first day of the summer, 4 months ago today I went to the gym. Since then I have been three days a week for the last four months. My routine would be a 3 minute warm up, warm down on a rowing machine. I took what my instructor had told me, which was mostly machines in the first month to build a bit of strength, I didn't touch legs (Newbie gains of around 18-19lbs that month!).

For the past three months, I have done 7 exercises of 3 sets. I only do squats for my legs (from 40-160lbs) this is mainly because they are just naturally bigger. The other six involves bench press (40-120lbs), I used the EZ bar until it started hurting my wrists, assisted pull ups, and a few others which I honestly don't know the name for, I only use machines when the free weight area is too busy. I tried to focus on compound exercises, so I haven't really done anything for abs.

Diet: Although I always thought I ate a lot, I forgot I had to compensate for my height. So for the past four months I have been eating roughly 3500-4000 calories every single day. Typical snacks would be four crumpets (16g protein 350 cals) / ham and peanut butter sandwiches / cashews / bananas I would either have cooked breakfast or a 3 egg omelette as well as my breakfast I had before of cereals. For lunch I would typically have what most would have for their evening meal, such as lots of sausages, ham and cheese. I would make myself an afternoon sandwich, and then I would have a massive dinner to top it off. I also had a protein shake every day which had Greek yogurt  and whole milk in it.

My plan is to bulk to 210, then drop to 200 and hopefully maintain there whilst doing cardio
 
Tomorrow I go back to uni, I told nobody from uni what my plans were, let's see if they notice, my friends at home certainly have!  

Any questions just ask.

http://imgur.com/a/5TEqa

The first three pics are actually from 6 months ago when I weighed 172. I then got a girlfriend and a physically active outdoor job and dropped to 164. About two months ago I hit the gym, gained a few more pounds, then read Starting Strength and had an epiphany. Squats. Squats everywhere. I love this program, and here's my variation. 

Day one: Squat, Press, Pull or Chin Up then Core and Calves
Day two: Squat, Bench, Deadlift or Power Clean then an arm pump
Basically one week I do day one Mon and Fri, and day two Wed, then alternate. 

Also, specs for 3 sets of 5 reps:
Squat: 225 to 285 (ATG or damn close)
Bench: 195 to 225
Press: 95 to 135
Clean (3 sets of 3 weight): 135 to 165
Deadlift (I suck at deadlifts): 185 to 275

My diet is literally as many calories as I can, in any way I can. Fast food, lots of milk, cottage cheese, avacadoes, sweet potatoes, peanut butter, and of course, oats. 

My goals for the next two months (I want to do this for 3 total), are 185 weight, 315 squat, 250 bench, 165 press, 200 clean, and 350 deadlift. I'll update you when I get there.

Exercising was becoming a fucking pain every time and I couldn't see myself make any progress at all anymore. Actually I was getting weaker. This week I got very sick again. I thought it was because I had just started in a new job and I had been working around the clock + had a few exams.  

So after visiting the doctor it seems I have mononucleosis. Thats what sharing a bottle of jägermeister with 12 other people does for you. Stupid, I know. :(   


Now I won't be able to do ANY exercise for atleast 3 months according to my doctor. I can't even walk up the stairs without being out of breath. I could feel the side-effects for up to a year too. Fucking great.   


Now I am afraid of that I'll lose all my gains and muscles. Any ideas what to do? Anyone else whos had mononucleosis here on /r/gainit? My friend who had mononucleosis lost 10kgs in just a few weeks! Good god I don't wanna lose all that progress.

Anyone may post a question (don't be shy!), and everyone is encouraged to answer. Please keep questions relevant to gaining. Example questions:

* What is TDEE?
* I'm tired of being skinny, how can I change it?
* Just how important *are* squats?
* I've reached a plateau, how can I get past it?

If your question is more specific to you, I recommend providing details. The more we know about your situation, the better answer we will be able to provide.

Hopefully this will help consolidate the many beginner posts we get in /r/gainit. I would also like to give a friendly reminder that the **[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index)** is considered a comprehensive guide on how to gain lean mass and has more than enough information to get any beginner started today.

I don't really have a specific diet (which I know is bad but this year is sort of like a test run for me). I pretty much eat anything I see and avoid junk food as best I can. My uni has a nice cheap restaurant that I hit up frequently though. I've definitely made progress these past few months and more than doubled my weight on almost every workout. Chest and arms are bigger, back and shoulders are getting there.

My issue is that my belly is starting to bulge out. I wouldn't call it ""fat"" but more like bloated looking. As far as I know I am not lactose intolerant or anything. When I flex my it stomach looks alright, but I defiantly have a thin layer of fat (as to be expected) when I do this (abs are barely visible). But when I relax it sticks out. I have not been doing any cardio other than 10min warm up before each workout. Can anyone tell me if I should start cutting now? Or if this is serious?

I'm 6'2"" tall and used to be (7 months ago) 250 pounds. I'm not really sure how much muscle I had but I was definitely fat. I tried the keto diet to see if it worked (didn't seem all that bad of a diet). Fast forward to present day. I'm now at 160 pounds and ""look like a skeleton"" according to my dad. He told me this and I think it holds true, that I've got a fresh start now. I can eat a healthy balanced diet and put some meat on my bones.  Making the transition off keto I know that I should add carbs rather slowly so I was thinking about maybe eating some chili and just adding some crackers to it? Or croutons to a salad? 

Anyway, I think that my TDEE is about 2500 calories, so I will try to get in about 3k everyday. I know that I should get 1g/lb of protein and the rest from fats and carbs. Are there any types of carbs I should favor over others? I know oats seem to be pretty big around here, but I've become accustomed to eating my schools eggs and bacon every morning. Also, my schools cafeteria is buffet style and I have unlimited access to it. I can go in any time between 7am-11pm. Also another. Carb related question, should I try to eat them more towards after my workout and only on workout days? Or does it not matter that much?  As for exercises  I've  just been doing some dumbbell exercises as I'm trying to build up what little muscle I have left before attempting 5x5 or one of those programs. 

Another question:  it seams most of u guys have been skinny most of your lives and this able to eat ALL the things. Will this effect me differently since I used to be fat?  I've heard that fat cells never really go away Nd that they have a sort of memory. Gaining all of the fat back would really crush me, however if most of that weight was muscle I would be quite happy!

I'm 26 years old. I've been the same weight (around 105 lbs) since I was 15, and I'm 5'9"". Before you think, WOW I bet she looks disgusting....I think I actually don't look unhealthy. I'm just really lean. Everywhere. And I have very narrow bone structure. 

It has not been easy being built this way; people, especially women, can be INCREDIBLY rude. Somehow even though most strangers would never remark on a heavy woman's weight/size/shape, they see no problem whatsoever with making remarks about mine. 

I've just had my thyroid tested and it was smack dab in the middle of normal range. There doesn't seem to be anything WRONG with me, it's just the way I've always been. I eat a lot and I burn it off quickly.

Also....I've had two children. I gained 40 lbs with my first, a 9-pound VERY healthy baby girl who I delivered med-free and with no complications. I lost all the weight within a month. Same story with my second. Great weight gain, big healthy baby girl, immediate weight loss. (I breastfed exclusively and actually had an overabundant supply!) 

I'm currently 6 months pregnant with my third daughter and here is why I am here: I really, REALLY want to keep 15-20 lbs of the weight I gain this time around. It would still put me on the very low end of normal but just to have that little extra bit would make me feel sooooo much better about my body. I am looking for suggestions on how to keep up with the increased calorie demands that come with nursing a baby, on top of my already super-fast metabolism. I am also open to suggestions for exercise, but remember I will be recovering at first, and then will be caring for a newborn, and 4 and 6 year olds :)

Thanks a lot in advance and I hope I can make my dream come true (with a lil guidance.)

I just wanted to make my first post here and share some of my noob experiences and maybe get some advice. I would like to go from 5'8"" 105 lbs. to 130 and then see how that feels and adjust necessarily.

Over the last month I've tried to ease myself into gaining. I downloaded myFitnesspal and have been halfway using it. I'm just starting to get my feet wet.  I love the app and can find most the things I eat/cook.  I just need to be more consistent.  
Would a 3000-3500 calorie diet work well as a starting goal and perhaps increase from there?

My goals have been to eat some oatmeal made with milk and add 2 TBLsp of peanut butter and some honey every morning.(I am a terrible morning eater) If not the oatmeal than at least 16. oz of milk with Whole wheat toast and butter or peanut butter or nutella. Another favorite is yogurt walnuts and honey. Any other high calorie breakfast ideas?

I've also been trying to increase the tolerance I have for milk. My problem is that my digestive tract has been a little uneasy trying to figure out whats going on.
I've gone from no milk in almost a decade to try to drink a third a gallon a day. The most I've had in one day was a whole half gallon. Is it relevant that I add a little bit of Strawberry flavoring (nesqwik type) to make it taste better?

Sometimes my stool is hard and thin, while others times its the exact opposite.  I'm not sure but I think the sugary holiday treats may have contributed to the loose stool. I've been taking a couple fiber (metamucil) type pills to keep me regular. They seemed to be working.

Anybody have a recommended dosage of fiber for someone looking to start on GOMAD?  A calorie goal? and finally tips on exercises that makes you hungry. I've been a basketball player but that doesn't work this time of year. 10 dollar memberships at the gym though I think it may be worth it to get on a treadmill.  I just struggle with having the appetite and want to do all I can to help it out. my personal favorites are the ERG rowing machines and Ashtanga yoga.

Hey guys! I always meant to make a post like this after 3 months but I kind of just lazed around and didn't do it. 

Anyways here is the before and after pics from my beginning at 135 lbs to 170 lbs. I started out with just the bar or a little more than that and followed SL to the tee. However in the last 2 months I've focused more on bench and ohp because those lifts were really going up slow. I would like to keep gaining (goal of 190) but with school and work I don't think I'll be able to finish it until next summer.

Anyways here are my lift numbers. All numbers are for reps of 5x5. I've never tested my 1RM.

* Squat: ~85-265
* BP: bar-165 (really want to get my bodyweight on this one)
* OHP: bar-95 (stopped doing this one since I was focusing on BP)
* DL: 135-295

What I've found is that getting into the habit of eating things consistently will increase your appetite. Start small, and increase, just as you would with a workout (you should also be hitting up the gym if you want to gain weight).

What I've done is I've started with eggs. Before, I could barely eat one egg. It was a serious challenge for me. What I've been doing in the past week is gradually increasing the amount of egg I consume each day.

First, I make sure that I know how to make my eggs **goddamn delicious**. For me, I whisk it together in a cup, add a hefty amount of pepper sauce (I like it spicy), and add a pinch of salt for a little flavor. Then, I fry it up real nice in a pan and make a basic omelette.

By simply getting into the **habit** of eating egg EVERY DAY, I've increased my ability to eat eggs, and my overall appetite. Before, I could hardly finish one egg. Now, I eat two eggs in the morning, and two in the evening. I plan to increase that number as well.

To make sure this habit sticks, I will also ensure that the fridge always has a stock of eggs. There is no excuse for me to not go out and restock if there are none left.

- Six Bigass carrots. 

- Two or three pounds potato

- Two cans canned tomatoes or tomato soup, whatever you've got. 

- Beans.

- Brown your beef. I just do it in the bottom of my bigass pot. 

- Saute your onions in a frying pan. Get em nice and brown, throw them in the pot. 

- Cut up the rest of your veggies and throw them in too. 

**Cooking:**

This shit's important, pay attention. Simmer, DON'T boil! It should be just hot enough that a few little bubble are coming up, but it shouldn't look like Mt. Doom post-ring.

This shit isn't hard. Go forth and make your gains. Extra gainz may be wrought by freezing portions of this to eat later in the week.

1364575912.0,14,self.gainit,1b90wq,"[Results] Smolov squats through Base Mesocycle. Gained 5 pounds in 4 weeks, took my squat from 330-360.",gocougs11,20,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1b90wq/results_smolov_squats_through_base_mesocycle/,"A little background. I'm 6'3"", I weighed in at 178lb today. 4 weeks ago I weighed 173. In the middle of December I weighed 167. In early December my squat 1RM was 265lb. Being a tall guy, I always have preferred deadlifts to squats, and I had a 445lb pull at that point. When I got my bench to 265 and realized I was benching what I was squatting, I realized that's bullshit and started hitting the power rack, hard.

I did a 20 rep squat program, which I posted the results from, [you can find that here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/183i85/just_finished_a_20_rep_squat_program_here_are_my/) I gained 6 pounds in 6 weeks with that (167lb-173lb), and took my squat 1RM from 265-330 (linear gains are awesome). I was a little disappointed that I could get 315x3 at that point, but could only get 330x1. I attribute it to the fact that coming off of the 20 rep program, my body was very used to doing high repetition work and not the maximal effort for 1 rep.

I took about 3 weeks of a break, only squatting 2 days a week, and then did the first week of the Smolov introductory microcycle. I jumped right into the base mesocycle after the first week, because I felt my body was ready for high volume squatting, since I had recently done the 20 rep program. I used 315 as a 'training max' to calculate weights for the base mesocycle, to make sure I wouldn't miss any reps.

**Smolov training plan**

[Here is a google docs link to the spreadsheet which outlines the program.](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx-ZEX9Q2F_ESUFxQVhtOWVPVm8/edit?usp=sharing)

Smolov is a 12 week program, consisting of 5 individual cycles. If you're not already used to squatting high volume, you should do the introductory microcycle (2 weeks). Then is the base mesocycle (4 weeks), which I just completed. Now i'm moving into a 2 week 'switching' cycle, and finally is a 4 week long 'intense mesocycle'. Many people consider smolov to be one of the most difficult squat programs out there. It is generally said that you should NOT attempt this program if you cannot already squat over 300lb. I wouldn't disagree. During the base mesocycle, you're squatting every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. The first week, Monday is 4 sets of 9 at 70% of your 1RM. Wednesday is 5x7 at 75%, Friday is 7x5 at 80%, and Saturday is 10x3 at 85%.

The second week, you go up 20 pounds for each of those days (i.e. 70% + 20lb on Monday, 75% + 20lb on Wednesday), etc. On the third week, you add another 10 lb. For me, this meant that my last 10x3 day was 10 sets of 3 at 300lb, which was 95% of the training 1RM I was using for this cycle.

At the end of 3 weeks of this, your body is not going to like you. For me, it came in the form of shoulder pain. I have a hypermobile shoulder, and so whenever I squat I have to pay a ton of attention to proper elbow and shoulder position. On my last 10x3 day, my shoulder felt like it was going to fall off after my 5th set, but I got through 5 more. It is important to note that Smolov is about the reps, not the rest. Take as much rest as you need to. If it takes you 2 hours to get through 10 sets, so be it. I think my longest day squatting was 55 minutes for 10 sets.

I was icing my shoulder immediately after squatting every day, and taking cold showers. There were days when I would go in, squat, and leave without doing any accessory work. Other days I would bench and do some upper back accessory work, and always a bit of dynamic shoulder stretching. After resting it for 6 days it feels great, and squatting today gave me no pain at all.

After those three weeks, you take a week off from squatting, and just eat and sleep as much as possible, and get in the gym to hit any muscle group other than your (lower) back or your legs. Then you test a new 1RM. I just left the gym, I weighed in at 178 and my best squat was at 360lb. So, I gained 5 pounds and added 30lb to my squat 1RM, in 4 weeks. Going into the next phase of the program, the intense mesocycle, I intend to use 350lb as my training max, again to make sure I can hit all my reps every day.

The intense mesocycle basically has me squatting 3 days a week, Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and again, it is high volume and training within 85%-95% of your 1RM.

**Diet**

My diet during this was pretty simple. I'm trying to keep my bulk fairly clean, but I don't trip if I have to eat some processed foods occasionally. I eat Honey Bunches of Oats cereal for breakfast, with a pint of milk in addition to the milk in the cereal, about 700 kcal breakfast around 8am.

I lift around 11am, then have a muscle milk shake that is good for 200 kcal and 20g of protein. I eat lunch around 1pm, usually have chicken, pork, or steak, and carrots or broccoli, with some rice and gravy, and a glass of whole milk which is all usually about 800kcal.

I keep a huge bag of trailmix in my desk at work that I snack on throughout the day. I'd say on the average day I get at least 1000 kcal from trail mix while at work.

For dinner, I eat steak probably 4 nights a week (usually on squat days). I also eat pasta with a meat sauce pretty often, and some sort of veggie. Dinner is usually 1000-1500 calories. I also have a big ass bag of trail mix at home, and snack on that after dinner until I go to bed. I also drink probably 1/2 - 3/4 of a gallon of milk a day while at home, just to make sure I'm well over my 3500 kcal/day goal.

I've been lifting in college for about a year and a half now. The day I moved in, I was around 132lb at 6'0. Freshman year goes by, and I make it to around 144lb. It's progress, but it's not great. Fast forward to the start of Sophomore year, and I have somehow magically lost 12lb, and I'm back at 132. I ponder the idea for a week, and think, how the fuck is this possible? A semester goes by and I gain a pound or two, and then two weeks ago comes around. I decide to start eating lunch every day at the all-you-can-eat dining hall on campus. Two weeks later, I'm up 10 pounds. It's no miracle, I just wasn't eating enough. I now estimate I'm anywhere from 3000-4000 calories per day. Obviously this rate of progress won't continue, but I'm pretty sure I'll now start seeing real progress since I'm feeding my body the energy it needs, and it feels fucking great.

Really all I'm trying to say is, if you're like me, you were making an attempt to eat more, and thought you were, but in reality it's not enough. When you think you're ""full"" go get another plate of food and glass of milk. Feeling ""full"" to me now is a totally different feeling.

I'm not sure if this is gaining quickly enough for /r/gainit. My problem is my eating-discipline ;-) But on the other hand: I'd rather not gain too much fat for vanity reasons. I know that this is not what most of you guys here would do, though.

Still, I'm quite happy with my progress so far, and that's what counts. http://imgur.com/a/oW3gW -- Before/After, both pre workout, not flexed.

I'm doing bodyweight exercises, so hypertrophy is not my first goal. Strength, balance, agility are more important to me.

I've always been very skinny, underweight/borderline underweight and decided that I wanted to fix that.

My routine has changed quite a bit, I started off with progressions towards...:

* Free-standing Handstand
* Full Bridge
* One-Armed Chinup
* Full Leg Raises
* One-Armed Pushups
* Pistol Squats

Some might have noticed, these are the Convict Conditioning exercises.

In the mean time, I've discovered that not all of these are fun and that they are not very balanced, so I followed some advice from /r/bodyweightfitness and the book ""Overcoming Gravity"" (see /r/overcominggravity) and what I'm doing now (including the progression I'm at) is:

* warmup: some dynamic stretching, some pushups, chinups and then handstand skill training
* Front Lever progression (current: Advanced Tuck Front Lever)
* One Armed Chinup progression (cur: Uneven Chinups)
* Handstand Pushup progr. (cur: using a math book [roughly 5cm, 2in] as help; against wall)
* V-Sit progression (cur: L-Sit)

I'm doing this every other day but sometimes skip a workout -- for instance when I feel like my joints have not regenerated completely or when life interferes.

I'm currently considering adding the pushup progression or a planch progression back in and might look for a gym after new year in order to add some leg work (which is not easily done using only bodyweight).
Some time after new year though in order to avoid the masses. I'm not in a hurry. ;-)

Additionally, I'm on the lookout for gymnastic rings in order to train back levers (they are a bit uncomfortable on the pullup bar).

Have started eating more and will keep a solid 3700kcal/per day intake for 2 weeks and see if it helps

**TL;DR: ~65kg, 192cm, 18y/o, moderately healthy diet, intense workout 4-5times a week, 4-day split**

Weight: fluctuates between **64-66kg(141-145.5lbs)**
Height: **192cm(6'4)**
Sex: **Male**
Age: **18**(Turned October 26th)
Bodyfat %: ~10%

**My goals:**
Muscle gains, which I have been getting to a small extent. I am aware that building muscle is a slow process and that the average male can build about 10lbs per year but what I've been seeing is minimal, I'm very young so my hormones shouldn't be an issue and I'm counting on being able to gain at least 10lbs of muscle in a year of intense training. **I've set a goal for myself to have gained at least 5kg of muscle within the next 18months.**

Disorders: **No disorders**, I have never broken or fractured a bone nor have I torn any muscles.

**Non-smoker**, I've smoked about 4 packs in my life and last cigarette I had was at a party in august.

**Nutrition:**

4-5 meals a day that consist with plenty of protein, calories and carbs.

*In-depth:*
Somewhat healthy, I consume 90-130g protein per day and anywhere from 2700-3000 calories, a moderate amount of carbs but couldn't give an estimate in grams. I tend to eat fast food anywhere from 0-3times per week, this includes pizza/mcdonalds/etc.

My favorite/most common meals is 5-7 fried egg whites with fried potatoes, or white rice with chicken. I eat salad every day at school and salad/veggies when they are available at home(3-6times a week).

I usually eat breakfast consisting of 3-5 egg whites and 2 pieces of white toast topped of with 2 large glasses of milk(Recently, also 3-5g creatine with cranberry/grape juice if I'm not working out that day)

I take 3-5g creatine about 1 hour after a workout.

**Exercise:**
For the last 13/14 weeks  have been working out 4-5 times a week, going to failure on each set the last 6-9 weeks. I tend to stay within the rep range of 6-15 on upper body and 10-20 on lower body. Recently I've started to do drop sets and also started supersetting workouts like dumbbell bench press with dumbbell flys. Example of drop sets would be dropping the weight about 25% twice and going to failure on each level(have only used dropsets/supersets the last 2 weeks). I do 3-5mins of cardio and stretch for warmup.

For the first month I did about moderately strenuous cardio for 30mins(warm up included) every workout but have stopped recently because I've heard/read almost everywhere that it eats muscle.

**My split** (with 2 days of rest somewhere in between):
1.Legs/lower back
2.Bicep/lats
3.Chest/shoulders/Triceps
4.Abs/Obliques/Calves

Sorry for the wall of text and any and all advice is appreciated!

P.S. Would performing full body workouts benefit me more instead of my 4-day split?

2 scoops whey protein (I use Optimum Nutrition Oats and Whey chocolate but im sure anything else does the same job)
1 tbsp coconut oil
2 tbsp peanut butter/nutella
one egg
Add ice for desired texture/consistency

I think one of these is about 1000 calories, equivalent to about 2 litres of whole milk. 

I'd love to hear some shake recipes you guys might be using

I’ve been going to the gym for about 12 months now…I like to think I’m strongish, can lift more than my body weight.

Doing 5x5 for the past 2 weeks (If people don’t believe I can lift these weights, happy to post videos)

Day 1

- Bench – 125lbs
- Squats – 209lbs
- Barbell Row – 137lbs

Day 2

- Deadlift – 137lbs
- Military press – 82lbs
- Chin ups/pull ups alt – Body weight
- Dips – bodyweight


Day 3 as per Day 1.


I have 1 protein shake a day, according to information on the container, the 3 level scoops are equal to I think 50g of protein and 600ish calories per serving.
Eating a footlong subway or similar in the day, usually chicken or steak.
Dinner usually chicken, red meat plus some kind of side
After dinner snack…biscuits and cheese or similar.


So I don’t eat all that much really. I’m guessing I’d be flat out getting 2000cals a day.


I’m thinking of starting the GOMAD. Is that what people would recommend? I want to get to around the 145lbs mark, maybe 150lbs. Is GOMAD really as good as it sounds on paper for us skinny fellas? 


Any other suggestions/ideas? Also I work a desk job so I could possibly just snack all day as it’s easy to do…

Currently sitting at 6'4"" and I think 180 (my scale is broken). 
Most of the summer I was working out WFS. On Wednesday I'd do Bench, Rows, and Squats at home and then go to a gym and do back accessories. Fridays would be Bench, Shoulder Press, Deadlifts, and then chest stuff at the gym, and Sunday would be Shoulder Press, Squats (or deadlifts) and Rows and then shoulder and core work. 

Starting this week I began doing PHAT because I wanted to work out more out of sheer boredom.

My Bench has been stuck at 155 for a while (up from 135), even with deloads. Squats 135-200. Deadlifts went through a major deload to focus on form and now I'm at 235. I do seated shoulder press and went from 100 to 140. Bent over rows are at 160. 

My weekly caloric average is within 2,600-2,800. I measure everything I eat and get adequate protein. I take creatine daily.

I just took those at the end of the day.

My goals are to fill out my shape to mask my wide hips, be lean, and gain strength for sports. People say to go by the mirror and not worry as much about scale numbers, but the mirror looks like shit and I feel like I've gained weight too quickly. 

If I cut now, would I just be taking two steps back? Should I continue bulking? Advice? Also, when I go back to school I will be having swimming practices daily, can I work around that?

A week later I was drinking mass gainers each day, eating a horse, and most importantly hitting the gym regularly for the first time in my life.

When I began I wasn't doing too well, started benching at 65 lbs, squats were barely any higher and dead-lifts were about the same as well. 5 weeks later and I'm only up to bench: 85 lbs, squats: 95 lbs, and dead-lifts: 105 lbs. I'm a little bit disappointed, as I expected more from 5 weeks of lifting, but progress is still progress. During the first 3 weeks I went from 113 lbs of skin and bones up to 130 lbs like it was going out of style. But its been 2 weeks since then and I haven't gained a single pound to speak of. Not only have I not gained any weight since then, but my lifts have stayed the same as well.

I'm currently drinking 2 of those mass gainer shakes per day, which with the whole milk is about 1000 calories a piece so I have no idea what I need to do to continue getting the gains I want.

Bugger it. I used to say I was a high metabolism kind of guy. I used to say I could never gain weight no matter what I ate. I used to think I had good posture.

All that was horseshit.

1. Eating 3000 k/cal per day is hard fucking work. Now I finally understand exactly how much I should have been eating all along. And low and behold, now that I'm doing it, I'm gaining weight and lifting heavier...

2. I don't really have a huge belly. I DO have some pretty severe Anterior Pelvic Tilt. It's exacerbated how big my stomach looks and been the root cause of all the lower back tension I've always felt. 
I'm going to start working on my APT this week (just ordered a foam roller) and I'm pretty terrified of how much more work it's going to take. But it has to be done. My stomach has bothered me for years and it's really strange that I never bothered to look in the mirror and notice the awful curve in my lower back. I can't wait to look in the mirror and see the APT gone.

I just finished week 4 of SS. Progress has been slow because I've been working my diet up at a slower pace:

Squat - 45 lbs moved to 75 lbs

Bench Press - 45 lbs moved to 75 lbs

Full Press - 45 lbs moves to 55 lbs (sadtrombone.com)

DL - 65 lbs moved to 110 lbs

Along with SS I do Ab Chairs (3 x 14), Ab Crunches (3 x 12) and Ab Pulldowns (57.5 lbs, 3 x 10)

In general my body is looking leaner and my pecs+arms are looking nicer already. I'm planning to start taking Creatine next week once I'm confident of reaching 3000 cal/day (I'm still seeing a day or two where I can't quite get there.)

5""1'/22/102lbs/f here, and I have a hurdle: ulcerative colitis. It's a (sexy!) inflammatory autoimmune disorder of the gut (euphemistically) and on the upside, it basically guarantees a cutting session sometime in my future. 

I've managed to gain from 98 to 102 over the past five weeks *during* a flare of my disease, which is pretty righteous. (Of course, plenty is lady padding - but there's good muscle, too). I've bumped from 20 to 35 lbs kettlebells, and am completely freaking out my neighbors by going into iron-slinging beast mode.

 However, UC has forced me to be pretty restrictive with my diet.

* No dairy
* No eggs (not UC related, actual food allergy)
* Low insoluble fiber (I can handle lentils &amp; oats reasonably)
* Low nuts (I can tolerate a small amount of nut butter)
* Low glycemic index (ie no potatos, white rice, bread)
* *Not too much meat* - this is what's killing me

Not being able to rely on the brown rice/whole chicken combo is really making it hard to find things - and enough things - to eat. As my flare gets going, I suspect I'm going to be living on canned salmon, luncheon meat, soft tofu, cooked-to-death vegetables through a strainer (ie baby food), and as much lentil &amp; oat as my body will let me handle. 

**Gainit, I come to you for advice and support!**

Injured my shoulder and had to take 4 months off in-between there somewhere.  When I started my max bench was ~110  or so and my current 1rm on bench is ~175.  However, the rest of my body has gained quite a bit of definition while my chest stays virtually unchanged. 

 Started at about 145lbs and I'm currently weighing 180 pounds at height of 6'3.  My chest day starts with 3 warmup bench sets and then a 3x5 at 145. Then in no particular order I do cable flies 3x8, incline dumbbell press 3x8, and pushups 3x to fail as my last thing in the gym that day. I'll either do triceps or biceps on the same day as chest, I switch those up.

So really what I'm wondering is if someone can explain how my bench can go up by 55 pounds but my chest looks very much similar to when I started lifting. Writing this on a laptop so I can't post any before pictures as I have none on it until tomorrow for a comparison.

Tl;Dr: Steadily gaining weight over 1.5-2 years, chest lifts are going up but chest definition is unchanged while rest of body progresses.

There are quite a number of milk substitutes out there such as Almond Milk, Soy Milk, Coconut Milk and Lactaid Milk. From browsing r/gainit frequently, I'm sure you've seen people advise drinking whole milk since it is very calorie dense and contains a ton of nutrients, which we obviously can't do. If you've ever looked at the nutrition tables on these drinks, you will see that they are very low calorie, low fat and generally directed towards those who are trying to lose weight.

The one milk that is an exception to this is the [lactaid](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_6-gDq0ffTtE/TBGbn5X7agI/AAAAAAAABdk/YifdScsN-X4/s1600/lactaid%20new%20look.jpg) one. This is actually 100% real milk, so it contains all of the nutrients and calories that help while gaining weight. The only difference is that since we are unable to produce Lactase enzymes to break down the Lactose sugars in milk, the Lactose sugars are all broken down for us while they are processing the milk. So you get to drink milk without getting sick!

In terms of calories, 1 cup of Lactaid whole milk is 160 calories, whereas Silk Almond Milk is only 60 calories. That's almost 3 times as many calories! Start using this stuff in your shakes!

I made a conscious decision to put on some weight a few months ago and have succeeded to an extent.  I'm a 5'9"" male and have gone from under 125 to 145ish.  I was lifting weights for maybe the latter half of this period (also gained the most weight during this time).

I noticed, however, that my stomach has taken on a lot of the weight.  It's not firm weight either, it's quite squishy and I can grab a hand full of it.  I'm worried now if continuing to try and eat more is a good idea if it seems to be just making me fatter, or if this is just a phase while gaining weight and due to not working out the whole time I have been eating more.  I do have concerns with other men in my family line being really skinny while younger and then getting pot bellies later on in life, but I would hope the weight lifting (and not being quite at the old age yet) would avoid that.  I still look and feel underweight everywhere else but my stomach (and to be fair, my stomach isn't really some massive entity in itself).

Some notes:
I haven't been restrictive about my diet at all, and I will say this has resulted in me having probably a suboptimal diet(lots of easy-to-eat high-calorie-but-probably-not-the-best-calorie foods like pizza).  I figured being restrictive would be bad when I obviously wasn't eating enough to gain weight.  I'm re-thinking this approach now.
I'm sore on most days from lifting weights 3 times a week, so I feel like the increase in calories should be going towards repairing the muscles, not my gut, but maybe my diet isn't well suited for that.
I don't do any cardio.  Other than lifting weights I have a pretty minimal amount of phsyical activity in my days.

Really I'm looking for some guidance/advice/insight/related experience.  Should I focus down on a diet?  Add cardio to my routine?  Do nothing because the problem will fix itself?  Something else?

I'm broke so joining a gym isn't really an option at the moment, but an ex-physical trainer friend told me to eat oatmeal in the morning, do pushups, squats and pullups, and then eat a fuck-ton of eggs.

I'm also going to try to the GOMAD thing, which I'll try to hit a gallon each day, but that's kinda unrealistic I fucking hate milk, and that's a shitton to drink.

Where you started, where you're at, what your goals are. I'll start with me:  

I've lifted off and on since I was 16 with no real direction. I wrestled in high school and lifted then (in addition to my practices), partied my ass off my freshman year of college, lifted seriously my sophomore year, then got out of it as school got tougher. Near the end of my senior year, I was swimming 1250m a day in the morning to prepare for lifeguarding in the summer, and lifting a standard split in the evening.   

I decided I wanted to get serious about gaining after passing my swim test, and armed with great information from my father (former bodybuilder...Jay Cutler got his start training at my dad's gym in the early 90s) and a local older bodybuilder friend of mine I got to work. I started at 150 lbs, ~5'11"", about 12% bf. I ate tons of calories (typically 4500-5000), ate clean, and did a standard split with a pyramid rep scheme (each set increase weight and decrease reps: 10-8-6). I later moved to a more hypertrophy routine with 3-4 sets of 8 reps, some of my other lifts I go lower with higher weight. I didn't use GOMAD or anything like that,  a weight gainer powder (Russian Bear 5000) helped immensely, and I always used whey isolate and creatine. I also started using a pre-workout (which I'm weaning myself off of now, as the caffeine effect has worn off; MusclePharm Assault), a test booster (MusclePharm Battle Fuel and D-Aspartic Acid), omega-3,6,9s for existing joint issues (tendinitis, etc. I've heard omega-6 and -9 aren't as necessary, but it's dirt cheap), and a sports multivitamin for days I'm not taking my gainer. 

I am now 175 lbs and about 14% bf, a gain of 25 pounds over 6 months. I've never been this size and it feels great. My goal is to compete in some small local shows, hopefully this summer but definitely the next while continuing my graduate studies. I'd love to hit 185-190 before I start seriously cutting, but the gains have slowed after the initial growth spurt caused by just starting to lift regularly. Some random strength stats (that I can remember):  

* Bench - 165x10, 175x8, 185x6 to 195x8x3 (I didn't bench until about 2 months into gaining, I focused on incline DB presses because they are more efficient, but I have way too much fun doing flat bench so I added it in)  
* Squat - 215x6 to 285x6 (I still pyramid these, I add 20 pounds and do 6 reps each set)  
* Deadlift - 135x10x3 to 225x8x3 -&gt; I never really did these before recently so most of this has been from form increases.  
  
What are you stats, goals, techniques, and more? I'd love to hear everyone's approaches. Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all technique, and what may work for you may not work for others. Learn to listen to your body, this is the greatest lesson of lifting.

The new school year is fast approaching - for some of you it may even be your first semester in school - but you don't really know how you can keep your diet where it needs to be while living the college lifestyle. With fried chicken and hamburgers at the dining hall, 10 fast food joints on campus, and the CVS nearby for a drunken snack, it seems like it's impossible to eat healthy without becoming a salad addict. Your dorm doesn't have a kitchen (not one you'd ever want to use, anyway), so you don't know where to turn when you want to put on some mass without succumbing to the freshman 15.

Luckily for you, bulking isn't as complicated as you think. Most what the fitness beginner's idea of ""healthy"" is comes from TV programs and magazines geared toward those trying to lose weight, which are probably trying to sell you something. Lite, low calorie, guilt-free, gluten-free, salads - whatever you think is healthy is probably keeping you from making the kind of improvements you want. To get big and put on muscle, you really only need two things in your diet:

High calories

High protein

You can FORGET about the rest. Fat, sodium, high fructose corn syrup, forget about it. It doesn't matter. All your body needs to gain muscle is 1. a ""calorie surplus"" and 2. a huge surplus of protein. Having a calorie surplus just means that you're eating more energy-producing food than you're using up during the day, and you just need to have lots of protein to make sure your muscle can grow.

High calories is going to mean about 3000 or more a day. High protein means more than about 120 grams a day. Here are a few tips for EASILY getting enough of both:

-Drink milk instead of water. Whole milk has about 150 calories a cup, and 8 grams of protein. If you drink 3 cups of milk a day, you're easily knocking out 450 calories and 24 grams.

-Snack throughout the day on junk food (you read it right). I was always a big fan of twizzlers (about 50 calories each, it adds up)

-Eat meat at every meal. A hamburger for lunch and fried chicken for dinner are easily gonna give you 50-60 g of protein.

-Buy protein powder, but no other supplements! At this point, creatine, preworkouts and other fancy supplements are not gonna help. A cheap whey powder (news flash - they're all the same) will give you about 200 extra calories and 30 or so grams of protein, taken just once a day.

If you do those four things, you can forget about everything else, keep lifting, and put on weight. My freshman year, I literally lived for a MONTH off of four foods - twizzlers, pop tarts, milk and protein powder - all while making steady gains in muscle without too much fat.

Ab workout:
30x3 Knee ups
30x3 Crunches
30x3 Reverse Crunches
1 minute x 3 Plank

I'll change it up every once in a while to throw spice up in it, but that's the jist of my workout.

EDIT:  Diet
Morning:  I'll eat Protein waffles (Made with whey) - You can ask for recipe if you'd like but it's about 24g of protein.  I do add light syrup and strawberries and raspberries.  I'll also have a fiber one bar.  I just drink water.  Also I take one Opti-Men Multivitamin tablet as well as my Biotin tablet (which is just for skin, hair, nails).  If I'm short for time, I'll just eat the Special K Protein cereal which has 10g per serving.  And I'm usually eating like 2-3 servings.

MidDay: I'll eat something like lean ground beef, steak, or chicken.  I'll add in a potatoe, white rice with egg mixed and very light soy sauce, brown rice, 

Night:  I'll eat some steak with eggs sometimes.  Or I'll eat some lasagna, chicken, or something, but it's kind of a lighter meal because I usually eat it right before I hit the gym (Yes I hit the gym at night a lot because it's when I have time.  And I still get 8 hours of rest)

Snacks throughout the day:  Fiber One Bars, Non-Fat Jello, Greek Yogurt, Banana split with greek yogurt instead of ice cream along with almonds or any nuts I have at the time, Strawberries, Bananas, 

I also take Gold Standard Whey Protein and Dynatize Elite Casein.

If I workout in the morning, I'll take whey protein post-workout and then casein before I go to bed.

If I workout in the evening, I'll take whey in the morning, and casein post-workout and then I'll go to bed.

Both servings are 24g each.  The casein also allows me to wake up with half-full feeling and not each junk food
which I am always tempted to eat.

Like a lot of people I've got an anterior pelvic tilt, which is giving me a kyphotic slumped posture that I'm not okay with. Since the beginning of the summer I've been focusing a ton on my posture. Pullups would be a great workout for my back, which would be great for my posture. The problem is that I can only do one or two and then I'm done, which doesn't exactly give me the back workout I need.

I'm looking for some workouts that will strengthen my back and make me able to do more pullups, without actually having to do pullups themselves. I've been doing bent barbell rows and seated cable rows for my back, but that's not really getting me where I want to be. Any pointers are appreciated, thanks!

EDIT: Here's more pics of my arms to see progress (sorry I don't have any before pics of them): http://imgur.com/a/b2I3U

My diet at first was whatever protein I could get my hands on- fast food burgers, chicken breasts, steak, primarily. Lots of milk too. Additionally, 2 scoops of protein (52g) and 16 ounces of milk after every work out. Because I initially put on some fat with my beginner gains, I've now been trying to watch what I eat and not have too much of a calorie surplus.

As for my routine, it's broken down into 4 days for my 4 major muscle groups: Chest/Tri, Back/Bi, Shoulders, Legs. I generally spend around an hour everyday in the gym doing 4 or 5 different exercises for the daily muscle group as follows.

Chest/Tri: 5x5 Bench, Incline Dumbbell Press, Pectoral Flies, Tricep Pull Downs, Skullcrushers/Inner Grip Bench superset.

Back/Bi: Standing dumbbell curls, Lat pull-downs, Bicep pull-downs, Seated Rows, Pullups, Standing bicep cable curls.

Shoulders: I'm not really sure what to call the exercise but I can describe it: Seated with dumbbells in each hand, elbows 90 degrees to torso, palms parallel with torso facing inward, swing arms out so that hands are on either side of torso (kind of like raising the roof), lift weights above head, bring them back down and reset hands to starting position. Repeat 8 times.

Deltoid flies, standing cable pull-ups, shoulder shrugs.

Legs: Squats 5x5, Deadlift, Leg Press, Curls, Extensions.

All of this is coupled with at least one mile of running on the treadmill at the end (and a 10 minute warmup on the bike before the start of the workout). Additionally, I try to play basketball every other day.

So, like I said, I've been at this for about 6 months now and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Good luck to everyone else out there who is trying to gainit; with hard work and perseverance, you can do it, too!

**Diet**

Most days begin with Serious Mass + Whole Milk + Coconut n chocolate Peanut butter = 1800 + calories. 74 or more grams of Protein. I've noticed I get tachycardia and it's pretty a fucked feeling.
So if someone has a theory let me know.

After the shake I usually don't eat much til after the Gym. Its usually anything I can get. Sometimes Chicken Stir fry. Ham Sandwich, Eggs, Cookies I dont give a fuck. Honestly don't have much choices but these last few days I been having George foremen grilled burgers with Onion, avocado, colby jack and honey mustard and mayo on white bread. Yeah I said white bread. 

Lets also be clear just as often I dont feel like putting up with that crazy heart rate shit and I dont have my shake or eat much. I mean not really. I'll have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich zone out on some video games and then snag some cookies or some veggie chips. Maybe before bed make a turkey sandwich with spinach. That is just depending how I feel in the morning. Sometimes I just dont wanna start my morning like I took a hit of meth.

In conclusion I like to have around 2600 calories a day when I can manage and cleanly as possible. I mourn every empty delicious calorie I eat, believe it.

**Lifting**

I started what I would call serious lifting in May 2012.
Of course I started with SS. I never read SS like I was suppose too. As a result I was mediocre^probably still am.

I took two things away from SS a consistency I never had for the gym or fitness and squats. I went looking for a new program cause I thought I was hot shit. I found GSLP online free somewhere read it thought it was cool bought a Villain t-shirt from their merch but I never did the fucking program. I took one look at the neck harness shit and I was like that's gay. 
All in all I ended up downloading 5/3/1 and other programs from some place or other but never implementing them. 

Currently this is what I do.

BW Pullups, Chin ups, neutral grip nearly everyday.

L-sit Pullups

Max weighted Pull ups and Neutral grip on occasion.

BW Dips &amp; Max Weighted Dips on Occasion.

Squats and Leg Press 1-3 times a week

Bench 1-3 times a week

DeadLift Once a week never more

OHP 1-2 a week maybe

But then again this is r/gainit asking how to cut carbs here is dumb.

There is no reason why any human being should be consuming this amount of lactose per day, period. 

It provides newbies with an unrealistic expectation of their ability to gain lean muscle (which is what this sub is all about) over the course of the x number of years they may continue to spend in the gym. Bodybuilders have consistently supplemented their diets with milk, but a gallon *a day* is simply excessive and pushes the dichotomy of weight gain = obviously good, which this sub tends to promote. There is no question that you will gain weight on GOMAD, but there are many adverse effects also associated with saturating your diet with lactose in this way, and you are much better off getting your macros from other areas.

It's a marathon, not a sprint. This sub does a great job of promoting a holistic approach to changing people's lifestyles, but I think GOMAD is a crappy bandaid solution which should not be promoted if we can avoid it.

5'11, 23M. Started eating bigger and lifting on January 1. I've been motivated by your progress pics so here are mine!

I was 145 for probably 6 years. I was so surprised to see gains... I was stuck in the mindset that I'd be stuck at 145. I definitely feel thicker, but I don't feel way way bigger yet.

I'm keeping it simple-- lots and lots of milk, eggs, chicken, yams, and noodles. Working out Monday / Wednesday / Friday, alternating squat/bench with a couple other exercises on one day with deadlifts and a couple others on the next.

My biggest tip would be to make a killer shake. Mine is usually my lunch and it's usually about 1.5 liters made with whole milk, eggs, protein powder, greek yogurt, strawberries, bananas (2), oatmeal, olive oil (4 tbsp), flax seeds, and the occasional piece of cheesecake. 

I'm moving into leaner things including cardio and I've now cut the oil from my shakes. Looking to gain the rest in muscle weight, as I've noticed quite a bit of chub (but I'm loving it right now, after years of skin and bone)
