My heart and prayers go out to you. As an experienced Alaska and Colorado structure and wildland firefighter I want to remind you that there is much you can do right now that will greatly increase the chances of your home surviving this fire. When the fire hits your neighborhood the fire department probably will not be there to save your house; there are not enough trucks and crews. They will choose a house or two to defend and the rest will be at the mercy of luck, God and the fire. Here’s what you need to do to defend your home: Clear all debris from you roof and gutters. Sparks and “firebrands” will land on your roof; if there are pine needles and twigs to burn that often is all that’s needed to set your roof on fire.

Clear all dead and dry brush and grass away from your house; the further away you clear the safer you are. Nothing flammable should be right next to your house including wood mulch. If I still lived in the Springs I’d be taking out the hedges and rose bushes near the house. Stacks of wood, trash, lawnmowers, etc. need to go away. Be 100% thorough. Mow everything within 10-15 feet of your home. Rake the dead stuff right next to your home. It will get very hot for quite awhile and those green leaves will turn as dry as paper and then eventually burn.

Trees are now your enemy and may cost you your home. Cut down spruce trees that overhang or are right next to your home. Cut off all low dead branches.

Be smart about where you put debris; expect it to be very windy when your neighborhood burns over.

Clean your decks and carports; just pile things in the garage for now. Put the extra car or boat in the garage or away from the house.

If you live on a hill realize that fire spreads more quickly uphill.

Find your photo albums and prized possessions; load them in boxes, ready-to-go on a moment’s notice (or just load them in your car right now). Back up your important PC documents on a flash drive or portable HD; put it in the ready-to-go box.

(I didnt know Joe) it was one of the best trips of my life, so good in fact I'm coming over again next month! I stayed in Thornton with my fianceé and we took trips around there, Denver, Fort Collins, Greeley, Boulder, Estes Park and Breckenridge! Those last two places took my breath away especially coming from a relatively flat island. We stayed in the Stanley Hotel which was amazing and took a sleigh ride in the dark to a log cabin! The mountains and lakes were beautiful  the people were extremely friendly and kind and kept asking me to say stuff in my accent to humour them! 

You guys have a beautiful state and I'm looking forward to many more trips there.

The part of it that applies here, directly, is that new tax revenues for the state that don't come from inflation or population growth **must** be approved by referendum.

This is confirmed by [Yes on 64's about page](http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/about):

&gt; This new tax must be approved by a majority of voters in a statewide general election in accordance with the Colorado Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). The general assembly will also be required to enact legislation governing the cultivation, processing, and sale of industrial hemp.

So, while the amendment being certified in the next 30 days likely means that arrests for recreational possession and use by state and local officials should be curtailed, we may not see full-on retail weed until after another election that approves the tax structure.

Our apartments and our manager's home became under mandatory evacuation so us 7, my manger, and her 2 daughters fled about 35 miles north of the fire.

We stopped into Chili's for dinner and it came up to the waitress that we were running from the fire.  She was very apologetic and was very nice.  All of us ordered our meals.  When it came time to pay, the manager of Chili's came over and said that he really felt for the victims of the fire, and he made the entire meal on the house so that we could focus our funds on getting through this fire. 

It was very touching and such an act of kindness to put such a large bill on the house (11 meals!), especially for my manager because while us interns have temporary apartments, she's the one who had a lot to lose with a house and everything else.

Amendment 64
Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado constitution concerning marijuana, and, in connection therewith, providing for the regulation of marijuana; permitting a person twenty-one years of age or older to consume or possess limited amounts of marijuana; providing for the licensing of cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, testing facilities, and retail stores; permitting local governments to regulate or prohibit such facilities; requiring the general assembly to enact an excise tax to be levied upon wholesale sales of marijuana; requiring that the first $40 million in revenue raised annually by such tax be credited to the public school capital construction assistance fund; and requiring the general assembly to enact legislation governing the cultivation, processing, and sale of industrial hemp?

If I vote yes, marijuana is just as legal as alcohol and cigarettes in my state.  If I vote no, I keep things as is.

When will recreational marijuana dispenseries start cropping up? Will existing MMJ dispensaries begin to sell to non-medical customers? Will recreational use and possession become immediately legal? If not, what has to happen first? Will there / can there be an appeals process that could overturn the ammendment?


I am mainly interested in informed and factual information, not mere speculation.


If anyone in the medical marijuana industry, or lawyers could chime in that would be great.

There are so many things to do and see in Colorado, it will take your breath away!

Being a long time (30+ years) resident I can tell you that you will not be disappointed!  Want some suggestions on things to do?  We are here to help.

First a few simple requests...

When hiking in our beautiful mountains and prairies it is important that you stay on marked trails and respect signs for restricted areas.  Some of our most beautiful locations now have ugly walkways with handrails and signs posted every few hundred yards because some people just can't resist the urge.

Please, resist the urge.  When places become popular foot traffic has a significant impact.  We want to share these beautiful places with anyone willing to make the trip but erosion, handrails and signs really detract from the natural beauty.

Many scenic roadways are also available for you to enjoy.  Be sure to only pull off in designated parking areas in our wilderness areas.  Erosion is a serious issue which can require costly repairs and have a bad impact on our natural beauty.  Bicycles are frequent even above 10,000 feet, blocking the shoulder is dangerous for cyclists and other motorists.  If you are winding your way up a switchback road and the view is just SO awe inspiring you MUST pull over and take a picture please don't.

Chances are there is a marked pullout just a bit further up the road.  If you stop at every jaw dropping vista in Colorado you may as well just leave the car behind and walk because you will probably find one around every bend.

If you haven't driven in the mountains before you should take some time to learn about the challenges you may face.  [Here](http://driversed.com/teen-drivers-education/Mountain-Driving.aspx) is a pretty good site that covers the basics of mountain driving.

We love our pets and would love to meet your pets too!  It's too bad some people have been irresponsible pet owners and there are now so many places pets aren't welcome.  Please respect posted leash and animal restriction requests.  Many of our trails are open to horses and a narrow section of trail, a skittish horse and a curious dog do not make a good mixture.  For the sake of your pet please pay attention.

Ticks carrying [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001677/) and Mosquitos can be a problem in Colorado.  Check yourself and pets for ticks after wandering the wilds.  Mosquitos in the high country are most active around dawn and dusk.  Repellent products that contain DEET seem to be the most effective.

Wildlife can be dangerous but the average bobcat or bear isn't out to eat a tourist.  If you stumble upon large animals or they stumble up on you be careful, avoid making fast, threatening gestures, back slowly away until you are a comfortable distance from the animal before you tweet a picture of it then leave the area.  It's their home and your tromping through it.  Show a little respect, pay attention and you will be fine.

If an animal does become aggressive put your hands up to appear larger, make loud, deep noises (again the idea is to convey a sense of size, not just volume).  Do not advance or feint toward the animal!  Slowly back away, count your kids and when you have a comfortable distance hoof it on out of there.

If you're camping use a bear bag and don't keep ANYTHING that smells sweet (lotion, chapstick, perfume) or food (gatorade, jerky, granola...) anywhere near your tent.  How close to your tent do you want bears to get?  That's about half the distance you want between you and anything a bear might find appetizing.  When you hear a 300lb behemoth snuffling around your campsite in the dead of night with only half a millimeter or nylon between you and it you will be wishing you put it even further away.

If you are on the plains or in the mountains weather can change FAST in Colorado.  Be prepared.  Don't park in a shallow areas or in narrow places where rising water can swamp your vehicle.  Do NOT drive through flooded roadways.  Bring rain gear even on the most cloud-free day you have ever seen.

You can count on losing about 4 degrees F for each 1000' in altitude you gain.  Dress in layers so you can easily add and remove clothing to stay comfortable.  If you go from Denver (~5000ft) at 80F up to say 10000ft (60F) and you add a little rain and some windchill and you'd trade your life savings for a pair of long pants and some socks.

[Here](http://walking.about.com/od/gear/tp/whatnottowearfunction.htm) is some good information on what you should/shouldn't wear when hiking.

Higher altitude means less atmosphere between you and the sun, bump up the SPF on your sunscreen to avoid burns, a hat is a good idea (see note above about temperature as well).

Stay hydrated, the best way to combat altitude sickness is to stay properly hydrated.  If it has caffeine or alcohol it DOESN'T COUNT, caffeine and alcohol are diuretics that actually leech water from your system.  Drink 2-3 EXTRA glasses of water if you live below the altitude where you will be exerting yourself that day.  If you have headaches, nausea or dizziness and you just got here it's probably altitude sickness, get hydrated, get in some shade, get your core temp down and take a little rest, it will pass soon enough.

I used to be an EMT here in the high country I have seen people die and get carted to the hospital for not following these simple pieces of advice.  Be alert to your own condition and that of your companions.  

Okay, enough of the finger wagging.  On to the good stuff.

These don't even start to scratch the surface of things to do in the Colorado outdoors but they are a good place to start!

You can come and have a wonderful adventure with just a little planning and a little respect for nature and the locals.

I'm sure I have missed a million things, I'm sure my fellow Colorado Natives and Transplants will have lots to contribute.  

We hope you enjoy your visit!

This is Nate here from the CU Boulder Distinguished Speakers Board. For those of you who haven't been over to the Boulder or Denver subreddit I thought I would make a post over here as well. A while back I posted on reddit for suggestions on who to have speak at CU this year, and on the internet and in real life the response was overwhelmingly for Neil DeGrasse Tyson. So we're thrilled to announce that he is the first speaker we are bringing to campus, on February 15th 2012.

Dr. Tyson will be speaking on the collective expectations of humanity's progress in space exploration and the geopolitical, cultural, and economic obstacles that must be overcome to achieve them. The talk will be followed by a half hour question and answer session with members of the audience.

Doors are scheduled to open at 6:45pm, and the speech will begin at 7:30pm. Tickets are $2 for CU students with valid student ID and $15 dollars for community members. Student tickets can be purchased from the Distinguished Speakers Board table on the first floor of the University Memorial Center, Monday through Friday between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Community tickets are available at http://macky.colorado.edu.

I work construction and we are going to build about a mile of fence around an old radioactive dump site.

I recently moved to CO, have zero friends, and underestimated the cost of moving and re establishing a life. I sort of exhausted most of my savings in these recent weeks and now I dont make nearly as much as I would like/ need. I've been trying to save to get back on my feet but while im gone I will still have to pay rent and utilities and cannot afford to pay another $550 for someone to watch him. Realistically, the dog only needs to be watched for 2 weeks max (probably 1.5), because then my uncle who lives in the area will be able to take him and watch him until im home.

My question is: Are there any redditors in the front range Colorado area that would be willing to provide shelter and stimulation for my boy for a few weeks? He is a 2.5 year old pit mix named Edmond, he weighs about 70lbs. He gets along great with every dog he's met and lives with kids normally. He is well behaved and very smart, loves to cuddle and play. He is very healthy and requires no special foods, medication, and has no allergies, very low maintenance. I can pay a little, but we may have to do a bit of negotiating or trade. He spends most of the day outside normally so a place with a yard and some other dog friends is preferable. Any help would be great.

Opponents seem to think the amendment has no teeth, and will result in more people getting in trouble, however I don't know the arguments as to why. Some don't want a regulatory framework at all.

As a general rule, I vote NO on all constitutional amendment issues. Once enacted, amendments, as opposed to initiatives, are very difficult to update/change, and debacles like TABOR are a risky outcome. This one, however, has the possibility to set a strong precedent. I'm personally torn.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Colorado during the summer and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

**Matt &amp; Courtney**

*  Prevention: clear all the brush near your house, don't let dead stuff hang around your lawn, and watch the accumulation of flammables like paint and stuff in uncooled spaces like garages, attics, and sheds. 

*  Preparation: Have a go bag with at least change of clothes and a month's worth of any prescription medicine for the whole family. Have fire exits planned in your house. Have exits from your neighborhood planned too. 

*  Dealing when a fire starts: Get gone. Don't argue with emergency services. Don't cry at them over your pets in the house and make traffic worse. Be a pro and keep your mouth shut and follow directions. If it turns out you had plenty of time, well, excellent - but you don't know that.

**Edit:** For people asking for the story of how I made such a dumb mistake... basically I just wanted to see some nice classical music, and looked up the NY Philharmonic. I didn't realize they were in residence somewhere else. I remember seeing something about ""In Residence"" but I thought it was some other orchestra in residence *here*, which I was fine with. Stupid, stupid...

**Update:** Wow, I'm honestly surprised at the attention this post garnered. You Colorado folks are alright. Anyway I will simply contact people in order of when they expressed interest, and move on to the next person if it falls through or they don't respond in say, 24 hours. Thanks guys!

We've made a note of Denver, Colorado Springs, Ft Collins and the Rocky Mountains. Have we missed anywhere? And are there any gems/must-visits in those locations?

**Should I consider visiting other states?**
Given that we'll be there for three weeks, would it be worth spending some of our stay visiting neighbouring states?

**What's the best way to get around? (within a state &amp; going state to state)**
As it's our first time we're really looking for some advice on this.
I (M/24) have had a clean UK driving license for a few years, would it be worth hiring a car for our stay? If so would this make visiting cities such as Denver more difficult? Which car hire companies would you recommend?
What are our options for public transport? I've heard Greyhound/Megabus buses are cheaper and offer more choice than trains. Are the buses the best choice for local and interstate travel if we don't hire a car?

He lives in Centennial along  University Blvd. But it's possible he's in the Cherry Creek area too.

I live in Boston now, found out through my mom over text just now. No computer access for a few hours but I'm using a smart phone. Not sure what the ettiquitte on this kind of post is. I know it's bleak but have to try.

Update: Just spoke with my mom. He still hasn't been found. He left absolutely everything at home but took his car. My aunt suspects he drove into the mountains. My mom is unclear as to what steps my aunt has taken so far, but I recommended everything suggested in this thread to her to recommend to my aunt.

I think I have found a home for him and it seems to be a perfect match! yay!

Hello! I have a ferret, Senior Bandito, he is 3.5 years old. He is very calm and loves to cuddle. He loves anything rubber and doesn't like to be pestered unless it is with cuddles. Bandito is a chunky Sable. He was raised with his late brother, I think he misses the companionship of another ferret...

I am starting a new job in which I will be on site for a month at a time. I will not be able to take Bandito with me and all of my family/ friends have very not ferret friendly homes or cannot sit him every other month. I love Bandito very much but I think keeping him in my custody and often moving him around is not fair to him at all. I know that I will not be able to give him the love and time that he deserves. If any of you ferret lovers in Colorado want another ferret or need a companion for your ferret, Bandito would make a great companion! 

I have all of his toys and cage and bedding that I can give you too. I just want Bandito to go to a good family that will love him and spend lots of time with him.

We will do everything we can to maintain it's beauty and culture.

Now please don't be mad at us for transplanting. My wife and I moved in to a home, and a family of four moved to California. It was a fair trade (because we will eventually have 1.2 children). We aren't overpopulating your state. We spent three years working, saving and planning our move to Colorado. Please do not mistake our coming as a pollution of your residency.

1357287316.0,24,self.Colorado,15xwrf,Denver Post burns pedicabbers - A word from the horse's mouth.,shr3dh3d,30,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/15xwrf/denver_post_burns_pedicabbers_a_word_from_the/,"Hi reddit,

I am a musician, college student, and pedicabber in Denver. Recently, Denver Post released this article that explains some of the new city requirements for our fledgling business. Among them do indeed require all operating pedicabs to have a city issued license plate on them by March 1. In the article are a number of other claims that I would like to comment on as professional ‘cabber myself. Most of the article brings attention to the unlicensed pedicabbers who still operate with an expired ‘pedal cab license’. This is what we are required to keep current to rent and operate a pedicab from any of the owners of the actual pedal cabs (or rickshaw, bike taxi, etc.). I can’t speak for all of the drivers that are out there on a regular basis, but I can assure you that the large majority of us take our work seriously, and we do everything we can to meet the legal and fiscal requirements of our operation. Any pedicabber who has a legit license will very likely (and proudly) display the laminated green and white card that indicates we have an up-to-date license on our cab or person.
	
Also stated in the Denver Post’s article are claims of $10/block overcharges and “games of chicken” on 16th st mall. I can neither verify or discredit these occurrences, but the going rate that we generally stick to is $2/block anywhere downtown, and a few other set rates for trips to and from the pepsi center and mile high stadium. I can say for myself that I never ask for more than what I believe is fair for a ride, and you can be certain that if we are all lined up outside of a venue after an event, we all have a similar price for the more common destinations throughout the downtown area. That being said, I would always rather give a ride to you for whatever price we can agree on than simply not give a ride. We are all highly negotiable. Please give us a chance before you dismiss our service as too expensive or kitschy.
	
As for the games of chicken, perhaps that happened, or a bystander saw a pedicabber going against traffic or something. I don’t know. This isn’t a regular thing we do and I never do anything to jeopardize the safety of somebody who has entrusted me with their life on the busy one-ways of downtown. There is an inherent risk to hopping on an open-air man-powered vehicle that weighs a tiny fraction of the multi-ton automobiles I share the road with. Obviously passengers and drivers of pedicabs are more vulnerable than anybody in a car, but Denver drivers are at least conscientious enough to share the road with us (however against their will...;). Furthermore, the companies renting the cabs DO insure the passengers. The industry standard is already well over a million dollars per cab despite the current legal limit being only $300,000.
	
So please, fellow pedicabbers, keep your license current and continue being cool. Prospective passengers, I consider my service a necessity as much as it is a novelty, and I would be elated to give you a ride sometime. Thank you Denverites! Please let us know what you think of our pedicab community...

We moved to CO almost two years ago from MO and had our MO plates for quite some (got new plates just before we left MO, expiration was two years later).  We have made many trips back to MO when our cars had MO plates and never got pulled over.  Then we got CO plates and EVERY trip now we get pulled over at least once.  Usually coming into KS from CO and in MO randomly.

Are we having a run of bad luck?  Has anyone been experiencing this?  We are never given tickets.  Most of the time the reason for pulling us over is something such as not signaling at a stop sign or lane change, speeding when we not, going much faster than we really were, following too closely, etc. It is usually things I have not heard an officer hand out a ticket for unless the driver/passenger was being uncooperative.  

They ask us some questions, once they separated us and asked us the same questions to make sure our answers checked out.  We even gave an officer an expired insurance card to see what would happen...""Have a nice day"".

It was a lot of fun and we are planning more group hikes.  If you are in Colorado and enjoy hiking, check us out!

Would anyone be willing to show me around your beautiful state for about a week?",robotnel,34,13,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/15baag/hey_colorado_i_wish_to_go_on_an_adventure_would/,"So here is my deal. I just finished finals but most of my friends are out of town. My Christmas holiday will NOT be very joyous this year as my family is extremely dysfunctional. I don't really want to go into that. 

I just want to get away, meet new people, have adventures, laugh, and finally come back with some interesting new stories to tell. I will pay for myself 100%, I am just looking for maybe a couch or spare bedroom and a host who is willing to show me around. 

About me:

* I am 25 years old 
* I am a veteran of the armed services (I served in Iraq from 2009 to 2010 as medic)
* I have just completed my first semester at a community college. I wish to become an optometrist.
* I am shy and reserved but I wish to break out of my shell; hence this 'sudden' vacation!
* I am honest to a fault which sometimes means I come off as rude or dickish. I really try not to be, but often I do it without really knowing what I am doing. My best friend tells me I just need to be more social to learn to pick up on these types of cues. 
* I promise to be as little of a bother as I can. If you allow me to stay in your home, I will be a model guest. If, for any reason, you decide I should no longer stay, I can always get a hotel. 

Some things I would like to do (no particular order)

* Go skiing or learn to snowboard
* Eat at an upscale restaurant (before I left for my deployment me and some of my army friends ate a restaurant. I paid $60 per plate, but my god that baseball steak was the best I ever had)
* See some attractions (weather permitting)
* Get way drunk one night and try to (i'm usually unsuccessful) not throw up
* Eat some edibles
* Go snowmobiling or some other outdoor activity
* Try wine for the first time
* Eat sushi
* Get a tattoo

I would (ideally) like to arrive before New Years and leave after about a week. Time is of the essence as the cost of plane tickets are rising fast (currently at about $500 - $600 for round trip). My budget for this whole trip is $1500, but that is a flexible number (I have quite a bit in savings). I will show my gratitude by paying for our dinner at an expensive restaurant, plus some other to be determined perks. 

If you are interested, please send me a PM or you could reply in this thread if you have more general questions you would like to ask me. I will give out a picture of myself and also my email and facebook only in PM. 

Thanks for reading and I look forward to visiting your state!

Please and thanks fellow Coloradans",Couldntstoplaughing,22,2,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/xikh5/need_help_crazy_land_lord_issues_please_and/,"Apparently after being made aware of it today, the property manager is coming into my room while I'm here and sleeping. (Creepy and unsettling) So I'm drawing the line, or trying to. 

I currently rent a room inside a house along with 3 other people. The owner of the house cannot be contacted, and the property manager is the only person with his info. The lease agreement tries to supersede federal and state laws, stating the manager has full claim to entering house and rooms any time. Also, the manager has raised rent without notification in writing. The last week, 6 days the shower/bath in the house was under construction due to mold and health concerns, and all tenants had to go elsewhere to shower and such. 

Some of my personal concerns and issues:

 Typically I work evenings 2pm-Midnight, and stay up til possibly 4~5am. Consistently I'm getting woke up at 7~9am due to the manager in house yelling matches, unannounced construction, and possibly him simply trying to aggravate me? 

He will leave chores for us to do (e.g. wipe down counters, vacuum, sweep, &amp; mop). Us as tenants do the chores and when he comes in later that week, he just charges us a 10$ fee for failure to meet standards. At this point we dont even do the chores and just pay him because why should we waste a couple hours of our time doing said chores when he still charges us. 

The manager sat me down and told me that taking a 10minute shower was being wasteful and not energy conscious. And that having my lamp in my bedroom on from when I come in from work til the morning hours was also a violation. And granted sometimes I simply pass out and it is left on, but in all seriousness, it's a lamp with a low energy bulb. 

Since it's a house with so many tenants I park on the street in front of the house. The neighbors sometimes like to park in front of the house and take up the few places we have to park and leave us walking from up the block. Confronting the neighbor about the issue, she got upset and rude with me and complained to the manager. I got an ear full about that. 

I've tried contacting some lawyers/attorneys to no avail. Fees for consults above 200$. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, I'm grateful. ",,False,self,t5_2qhkb,False,,,True,t3_xikh5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/xikh5/need_help_crazy_land_lord_issues_please_and/,
