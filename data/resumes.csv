1317492471.0,79,self.resumes,kxn25,The most frequent advice I give about resumes...,Inri137,86,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/kxn25/the_most_frequent_advice_i_give_about_resumes/,"So I've helped at least a dozen or so people on this subreddit rewrite their resumes, and I put together something on the advice I give the most:

* Do not include an objective. It really doesn't mean anything, and unless you are at the executive level you probably don't have any *real* objective other than getting a job. Instead of an objective, put a summary with one to three sentences describing you and your background, tailored to the specific position to which you are applying.
* When trying to figure out what to list in what order, consider how the various things will be important to the employer. If you just graduated, go ahead and put your education up at the top. It's fairly reasonable to follow this with a bullet list of your skills and then your experience (because your experience up until now is likely not very substantial). If, however, you've been employed for five+ odd years, your experience should come first as it will probably be more relevant to an employer's talent search.
* If you worked as a cashier or similar for a few years, include this on your resume if you have space. You don't have to list off all the wonderful cashiering things you've accomplished, but having it there shows you've *been responsible with someone else's business,* and that you haven't just been idle during those years.
* Have someone else proofread it (even Reddit!)

The single most important comment I give out on a regular basis concerns how work experience is formatted. First off:

* Times New Roman is a pain to read. I like using Georgia myself, or Arial or moderncv (if you're using Linux/TeX). All these fonts are free, they're simple, and *easy to read both on screen and in print!*

* Make sure everything is indented and formatted consistently. Make sure you only ever use one style of bullet points, or the same font for the same parts of the description.

* Learn how to use right-aligned tabs. When you click the ruler in Google Docs or in Word it will put a tab at the ruler location. Click again (or select right-aligned tab) until you get to one that looks like a backwards L. When you press tab, your cursor will move to this tab and you will begin typing right aligned text. This makes it super easy to line up dates and locations and things.

* The most successful resumes I've come across follow roughly the same format:

&gt; **Job Title** [TAB] *XX/20YY - XX/20YY*

&gt; **Company Name** [TAB] *Location*

&gt; *A one to two sentence description of your responsibilites*

&gt; * And **most importantly,** every single bullet point

&gt; * is an ACCOMPLISHMENT, not a responsibility. e.g.

&gt; * Lead team to develop product X in Y timeframe for gross production

&gt; * Implemented cost-saving measures resulting in $X savings

as opposed to 
&gt; * Programmed simulations of [...]

The rule of thumb you can use here, again, is to consider whether your bullet point is a description or an accomplishment. If it's something *anyone* in that job at any company could list, then you're just wasting space by listing it. If you worked there for any span of time, surely you've done *something*. Take a few hours to think about all the projects you've done. Describing your contributions to those projects is way more valuable than listing your generic job responsibilities.

The biggest problem I see, after fixing formatting/grammar issues, is that resumes will feel unorganized or generic. Generic both in the sense that you don't get the impression that this resume was tailored for the specific job, and also generic in the sense that anyone with a similar background could probably change the name at the top and it would still apply to them 80% as well.

*""To be gainfully employed where I am equitably rewarded for my talents and efforts while contributing to the continuing success of the going concern.""*

That's more to the point. It says, ""I want a job, money, and I might actually care about the company."" Guess what, I already know that. 

*""To obtain a long-term position that enables me to utilize my accounting experience""* 

You're applying to be an accounting manager, and you want to use your accounting experience? YOU DONT SAY!!

*""""To secure a position within a business  — operations sphere of influence which will enable me to contribute to my future endeavors and viability of an organization.""*

You want to work for a business? NO WAY, WE HAVE A BUSINESS! I read ""operations sphere of influence"" and didn't even try to understand the rest. 

Anyone else feel this way? Let's punish the people who include Objectives.

I graduated in 2008, couldn't find a job. Even paid for a professional resume creator person, which I thought made my resume look like shit. Got a bunch of interviews, but during the interviews I was pretty much called a liar because I didn't include information that was relevant to the job(which was advice from the resume creator guy.) 


I was told that a future in I.T. was worthless unless I was a programmer. I self taught myself some python and went back to college to finish their programming course. I ended up quitting due to being offered a job doing customer service over the phone for a shitty wage. 

As soon as I got the job at the customer service place, I discovered reddit. About 6 months ago I submitted all my information to /r/resumes and had you guys critique my resume. I got a lot of fantastic advice and implemented everything into my resume. Just a few DAYS after submitting it, I began a 6 month interview process for my dream job. 


I was informed 2 weeks ago that I got the job. I am sorry that I cannot disclose the job title or pay at this time, but my life just pulled a full 180. I currently have 3 loans, a maxed credit card, and an empty savings account. This job will allow me to pay of my car loan, one of my student loans, my credit card, and get some money into savings....all in less than one year.

For many years, I have been hearing from C level executives and other hiring managers about what they like and don't like regarding resumes.

#1 NEVER put an Objective or Summary at the top of your resume. It has never helped someone get a position but I have seen it hurt people many times.

#2 Use a traditional format with a traditional font. Use bullet points instead of long paragraphs. Decision makers in companies want to be able to find the important information quickly. Don't make it difficult for them. Don't add pictures, colors, funky fonts or use a weird design/template. These things don't make you ""stand out""......they piss off busy people.

#3 Try to make your first couple of bullet points under each job about accomplishments. Put something down that will separate you from everyone else. Did you save/make your company a lot of $ by doing a special project or something innovative? Did you finish a project well ahead of schedule? Did you land the a huge new client? Things like these.....

#4 When listing employment dates, put the month &amp; the year.....not just the year. 

#5 No, you don't need to list your references on your resume or say ""References Available Upon Request"" - they know this.

#6 Under no circumstances should your resume ever be over 2 pages long. 

I know that there are career counselors, resume experts and college advisers who will completely contradict some of the things I am saying. They are wrong and I am right.

(It's in West Michigan, pm me if interested).

Tips for those of you wanting to get past the first round. 
-Give me information pertinent to my search.   
- Don't use exclamation points!!!! I just took someone out of the running because of the 30 exclamation points. Averaging 2 per sentence.     
- Don't tell me your life story. I don't care at this point. Sounds harsh but sending me a picture of your family and your family story makes you sound desperate and creepy.  
- If you jump jobs every 2 years or have a large gap in employment, you're pretty much screwed. Sorry.  
- Include dates of college graduation.   
- I don't care about your words per minute GPA (unless you got a 4.0 from harvard), high school awards from the 90's, etc.  
- give me the best information you have in the shortest space possible.  
-If you have a large gap in employment, explain it quickly in your resume. (Took time off between 09-11 to birth children etc.) Large gaps are big turnoffs.  

The best candidates for any job have prior experience or education that lines up with our needs.

Hey folks- here is a [repost](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ftpim/reddit_can_we_compile_a_list_of_tips_for_creating/) of information I've compiled to help people in need of resume/ cover letter/ (insert job-related item) advice.  More to come, but for now I hope this helps!

SUPER LONG POST, BUT ALL VERY RELEVANT! No TLDR here, just good job hunting info.

Longtime lurker, first(ish?) post--this is something I can actually help with! I'm the Director of Career Services at a law school in Los Angeles with 3 years in various Career Centers. I also have an M.S. in Applied Communication which has helped in this profession a lot. Here is my in-depth presentation for all students, very sorry for length, but very helpful if you are looking for a job and designing a resume. I will also post this in the relevant subreddits. Templates are attached via imgur link. Grab a drink, turn on some dubstep, turn down the volume on Rachel Maddow, and read when you have time:

I. Foundation Building

A. Employer vs. Applicant The most important person in the job hunting equation is not the applicant...it is instead the person reviewing your resume...the employer-to-be. The job search is not about you (applicant) finding a job and making money...the process is about you (applicant) demonstrating to them (employer) that you can fulfill a need that they perhaps don't even know they need met. It’s not ""what can brown do for you"", but vice-versa. The goal is to think of everything from their perspective...from this frame-of-reference, we can instantly know that:

•As a piece of paper, you mean absolutely nothing to them and they will throw you out at the slightest mistake. Perfection is necessary, and perfection is earned by mastering 2 things: consistency and specificity. E.g., be consistent in your labeling of states (if you use ‘CA’, so help me you better avoid spelling out ‘California’ anywhere on the page), be consistent in your documentation of timeframes (like sizes of hyphens between dates; switching between ‘Current’ and ‘Present’ [i.e., ‘June 2006 - Present’ vs ‘June 2007 – Current’ is wrong on two counts), etc. Be specific through your use of details, explained below. -You are entering into the economy during the upside of a bad recession, which means people aren't laying off as much but there are fewer job openings per applicant: [relevant info from The Atlantic.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/03/the-mother-of-all-jobless-recoveries/38004/) You need a perfect document.

•They are busy people who have a million things to do (in addition to the million resumes they are reviewing), so your resume needs to be presentable in 30 seconds or less; however--in practical terms--you have 5 to 7 seconds to make an impression. This means your resume 99.9% of the time will be limited to one page (CVs not included). CVs are for primarily academic- and research-related positions, FYI. They place an emphasis on written works, conferences, subject matter, etc. Resumes place an emphasis on quick fact dissemination. How to get it to one page? 1.) Move default margins out to .5”-.75” on every side; 2.) don’t stack contact information beneath your name [move it to the left and right margins, see templates below], 3.) utilize the white space beneath your headings; and 4.) leave information off of the page. This leads to:

B. Helpful Analogies

*Think of your resume as a 30-second movie trailer. Remember a movie that you really wanted to see at midnight on opening night (e.g., The Dark Knight.) You may not be the type to dress up as The Joker or Batman--heck, that might annoy you--but you love Nolan's take so much that you're willing to be there with all of the other mega-fans (who have also dropped nearly $30 for tickets and crappy refreshments). Now, what if the movie trailer had been more than just Heath's voice over a hazy blue bat signal? What if the trailer had given away the secrets or ending to the film? The short answer is you wouldn't have to waste your hard-earned money or time to see the movie at midnight...you could wait a few days or weeks. The same can be said about a resume: if you try to tell them too much, they won't have as much need (or desire) to see you in the interview. Tease them: the purpose of the resume is not to get you the job; rather, it is designed to get you the interview! This means you can leave redundant and less-than-relevant information off of the resume and save it for the interview. They'll swear you ""leap off of the page"" (which is the whole idea).

This also means that you will never have a generalized, catch-all resume. Each resume will be designed according to the specific employer's needs. For instance--to stick with the movie analogy--let's assume you're a marketing executive charged with making a 30-second trailer for your newest 3-hour epic film, Titanic. You have 2 audiences: young men and young women. Your 30-second trailer for young women will be perhaps nothing but shots of Leo DiCaprio. Your trailer for young men will be 30 seconds of Kate Winslet, gunfights, the ship sinking, et cetera. Same 3-hour movie, completely different trailers for your audiences. The same applies to resumes: Employer 1 might need to know A about you; Employer 2 might need to know B about you. Know who you're writing the document for! *Your resume can also be visualized as a book. The title of a book is on the cover and is generally the largest text there is. Your name is the title of the resume; likewise, it needs to be big, bold, and caps-locked (16-18 point font works wonders). You find a book in the library by the ISBN number; likewise, we need full contact information for you beneath your name. Postal address to the left (or PO Box if you're nervous about putting private home address out there), phone/ email to the right. This saves space and groups relevant information together. [See resume and cover letter templates here with all comments.](http://cainman2k3.imgur.com/career_services_information#0Xphl)

*When you open up any book, you'll find the Table of Contents which lists the name of each chapter. Likewise, each section heading of your resume could be considered a chapter name. What if we open your book—Herp Derp's Resume—and see a chapter entitled ""Murder""? We would expect to read about homicide in some fashion in that chapter. If we don't, the reader then feels misled, lied to, pissed off, etc. Make sure the section headings reflect what is actually in each section. Prime example: -Section heading named “Work History”= VERY BAD. For starters, you’re not telling me every job you’ve ever had in your life, so we know you’re not telling me your entire history and this heading is a lie. I will either throw out your resume right away (in 5 to 7 seconds), or I will look at the HISTORY part—timeframes of employment—which leads to one of the biggest problems people have with resumes: “Unexplained Gaps in Employment”. Frankly, this is irrelevant, but by telling me to look at your HISTORY this is the first thing I go to. Instead, let me know right away that this isn’t everything there is to know about you—this is a trailer, remember?!—so call the section what it really is: RELEVANT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE. Likewise, for skills, don’t just call it the SKILLS or ABILITIES section. I’ve never met you before, and if your heading is this followed by 4 or 5 bullets, I think you have…4 or 5 skills. Follow me? Label these SELECTED PROFESSIONAL CAPABILITIES or HIGHLIGHTED PROGRAMMING PROFICIENCIES, etc.

C. Formatting Notes

*People start reading on a page from the top-left to the bottom-right. Therefore, everything on your page must follow suit: most important information (to them) on the top and left margins, least important on the bottom and right margins. I.e., dates always go on far right margin (Most current on top).

Never use underlines! The only acceptable place for a line is perhaps one that divides your contact info (the cover of your “book”) from the rest of the page. Lines break up reading flow and direct eyes to different parts of the page; they need to read it from top left to bottom right. We will use combinations of bold (for the most important information in each section, which comes first/ at the top); italics (second most important information in each section, which comes second/ below bolded text); and regular style (for everything thereafter).

There are 4 general sections to a good resume: Education, Relevant Professional Experience, “Skills”, and a section about…you (i.e., Selected Honors and Achievements). Each section takes up about a quarter of your page and can be broken down into sub-sections (i.e., “Skills” might be “Selected Computer Capabilities” and “Highlighted Language Proficiencies” or “Relevant Professional Certifications”). Employment might be broken into “Selected Programming Experience” and “Other Professional Experience”. The ordering of sections depends on the employer! I.e., if you want to be a lawyer, the first thing they’ll need to see is your Education (law degree). However, if Mr. Lawyer-to-be wants to work at a Tanning Salon, his Relevant Professional Experience might come first (see templates).

* Put your resume in PDF format, because a Word doc will include red and green underlines. This can also help avoid formatting issues. **EDIT** Recruiters may not have the capabilities to scan PDF documents properly. Use this tip with caution!
* Create a Skills section with very specific details (ie: not ""hard worker"") to showcase what you know.
* Jokes are, in general, a resume no-no. It looks very unprofessional and shows you're not serious about the position.
* Add keywords to the footer of your resume (white, size 1 font). Resume-scanning software will see the keywords, but human recruiters won't. Redditors report that this can really increase the number of calls you get, as more recruiters are seeing their resumes.

Do you guys have any more tips for college-aged (and older, possibly second-career) students looking to break into the workforce? I'll be sure to give credit to everyone who submits a tip, and I'll post a link to the article when it goes in (late March).

If you want your CV done properly then please let me know but note that this offer comes with the following conditions...

1. No recent graduates.
2. You need the work.

That is all.

If you are finding the current job market to be a nightmare, if you have been unemployed for quite some time, if you have mouths to feed or bills to pay, if you want to get out of a rut then try me out.

The service is free to anyone who actually needs it given that it's my own free time I would be spending on this and I will assist in any way I can.

If you are only interested in career progression or you have recently graduated then I am sorry but you need to go to someone that is getting paid to help you.

My only final stipulation is that if anything that I do assists you in finding a job then you must pay it forward. Help someone else out who is in need of a boost even if it is just a couple of bucks given to a charity from your first wage packet - I in turn expect nothing back.

Most of the reviews in this forum center around just a few key areas: accomplishment focused content, readability and consistency (in formatting and voice). This FAQ aims to clarify some of the questions surrounding these ""heavy hitters,"" as well as some other common questions.
It is important to keep in mind that there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to writing a resume. There are just too many factors (industry, years of experience, etc.). However, there are some truths – some widely agreed upon standards – that apply to most situations. The following guidelines are a culled from the thousands of resume reviews and answers in this forum.


**How can I get the most out of this subreddit / help out?** 

1) Post a resume, even if you think it's garbage - it gives reviewers something to work with. If you upload a pdf to google docs, make sure it's shared. Tell us what type of position you're applying for, and at what type of company, even if generally.

2) Thank your reviewers, they really appreciate it!

3) Help review resumes.

4) Don't downvote resumes that haven't been reviewed yet.


**What should I write in my objective?**

[Objectives are generally a waste of real estate](http://petdance.com/2011/09/objective-obtain-job-where-i-commute-by-zipline/).  Instead of an Objective, why not include a [Branding Statement] (http://www.tandemresumes.com/tag/branding-statement/). A concise, memorable statement that lets the reader know what you offer the company.

Here is a tutorial on writing a Branding Statement: http://redd.it/trja0


**What should I put in my work experience bullet points?**

Try to make your bullet points about achievements rather than duties, include numbers wherever possible.

Example of a good bullet:

* Saved President by swimming .25 miles to Dr. Evil's lair and defeating over 200 henchmen using my Golden Swan Kung-Fu

Example of a bad bullet:

* Participated in missions as required


**Do I have to list all of my positions on the resume?**

You want to make sure that the information you are including in the resume is relevant to the position. Leave off or significantly scale back out-of-date or unrelated positions. This way, readers will focus more on recent and relevant experience instead of getting distracted by information that does not add as much value.


**How long should my resume be?**

You want to make sure your resume is only as long as it absolutely needs to be.  Since the goal of a resume is to pique readers’ interests, establish qualifications and create some curiosity gaps – those questions that get you an interview – one / two pages should be enough.


**I have this list of skills, do you think I should expand it by telling people about my excellent interpersonal skills?**

Soft skills end up sounding like [fluff](http://petdance.com/2012/02/never-put-excellent-communication-skills-on-your-resume/).

Ideally, your bullet points will highlight quantifiable achievements as opposed to responsibilities.  That means specific accomplishments with metrics to back them up.  It is more effective to tell the reader how you have impacted the company and how you have added value.  


**I keep reading that keywords are important.  Is this true?**

Resumes today need to work for both human and computerized screeners.  Since your resume will most likely need to be positively flagged by a computerized screener first, you need to focus on including strategic keywords.  Of course, you don’t want to take it to an extreme, as it is easy to cross the line onto keyword spam.


**Should I list interests / hobbies on my resume?**

This is a gray area.  Historically, including this kind of information has been frowned upon.  While there are still many companies that will view this kind of information as superfluous, there are some that want to know about your personal interests.  The best advice is to research your audience and determine if this information is appropriate for the specific company to which you are applying. 


**Do I need to write a cover letter?**

Yes, write a concise and powerful cover letter. A cover letter is different from a letter of transmittal, which just says ""stuff enclosed"". The cover letter is your opportunity to set yourself apart from other candidates, and will also serve as evidence of your skill in communicating. A good guide can be found here: 

http://www.uwec.edu/career/online_library/coverletters.htm 

Make every effort to find the name of the hiring manager for the company.


**How many resumes should I send out, how much time should I spend on each one?**

In today's economy, it is not uncommon to send out 20 resumes before receiving a call back. Each resume should be targeted toward the position to which you are applying. That will mean that you have several versions of your resume. Also, every cover letter should be targeted toward the specific position AND the company. 

As for how much time you should spend, it will vary, but it is much better to spend your hours finely crafting a small number of very excellent, tailored resumes/cover letters rather than spamming out a large number of materials that aren't as good or as position-specific.


**Where should I put my references?**

Don't include references or “references available upon request” on your resume.  Do bring a reference sheet to any interviews so that you can provide them should they be requested.


**I don't have any idea how to start?**

If you are using MS Word, you may find [this article on formatting](http://www.lifeclever.com/give-your-resume-a-face-lift/) helpful.

Here is a LaTeX cover letter and resume from [/r/LaTeX101](http://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX101/):

http://latex101.wikispaces.com/Lesson+5

Don't get too attached to any template, use it as a guideline.

As an explanation as to why I don't have examples of this stuff already, the school I went to primarily focused on abstract and postmodern art.

Here are a few things that I would recommend you consider.  This sentence is from a resume that prompted me to make this post.

""Provided sales services and developed sales strategies, attain new Client through Relationship generating.""

* **Make sure your grammar is consistent.**  This is taken from a current position of employment, so technically it sounds like she used to develop sales strategies but continues to ""Relationship-generate"".
* **Don't capitalize nouns mid-sentence.**  Random capitalization of words may make you look like you have the expression capability of a teenage girl.
* **Keep your list of responsibilities short and relevant.**  This description is one of 32 other points of responsibility this woman gives.  This is way too many, especially if you're looking within a specific industry.
* This isn't in this sentence, but everyone says that they have ""outstanding interpersonal skills"", that they're ""detail-oriented"", or have a ""proven ability to work within groups"".  If this is true, you should be mentioning your accomplishments through your employment.


I haven't spoken to too many other recruiting managers on this subject, so these may be personal but my preferred tense is past for past employment and current for current employment.  I'm also a fan of full sentences.  I'd rather read two sentences under a job heading saying, ""I was responsible for..."" than reading what would other be a personal to-do list if you were at work.

One final note is on font and formatting.  I'm hiring for sales positions and a resume tends to be my first impression.

To Whom It May Concern,


Allow me to briefly extend my appreciation for reading this letter. I am a young man who is currently enrolled in college, and I am studying Business Administration. Realistically, I am not studying business because I have a passion for sales numbers, income statements, and annual reports; but rather, I am studying business because my personality, and my life experiences have provided me the natural skills that will help me succeed in the “World of Business.” 


I work comfortably without much supervision, or with a lot of supervision. I enjoy working in a team, and enjoy any opportunity to build relationships with my peers, which will, allow us to work more efficiently with one another. I also have experience with various leadership roles. I handle responsibility (of any magnitude) calmly and diligently. I am accountable for my own mistakes, and I am always loyal. 


I have high hopes and big goals ahead in my life, but now I am just trying to make a living; and I want to do so while maintaining healthy balance of school, work, and recreation. To be upfront, school is my number one priority. That is a first for me. I have forced myself to learn how to be a diligent student. It has positively impacted all facets of my life. That being said, despite if school is my first priority, I still have an abundant amount of time to prove that I am an invaluable asset. 
	

I am motivated, and I am driven. I hope to find myself in a position that allows me to learn first hand from somebody with experience and knowledge. I am professional, presentable, and humble. I understand the importance of knowing how to conduct one’s self in a professional office setting with customers, peers, and superiors. 
	

I am a unique individual. I know this is not the proper “cover letter format,” those are, “a dime a dozen.” But I feel, in this letter, and in *this* format, it indicates my ability to articulate myself. Furthermore, it is personal and informative, as well as –revealing.  


Thank you, and Best Regards.

I wanted to drop a few lines of advice to people working on theirs.  These are just my personal opinions developed while looking for people.

* Keep it short!  2-3 pages max!

You read this online, but many people don't follow it.  Personally I only look at the last 5 years or so when looking at someones resume.  I usually really don't care what you did 15 years ago.  Most of it is not relevant now.  I have had a couple of 10 plus page resumes and all it does is muddy down the important stuff.

* Fix your spelling and grammar.

Seriously do this.  I am not king of spelling / grammar, in fact I am pretty terrible, as you can see from this post.  For a resume I have multiple people proofread it.  The problem is if you don't care enough about spending the time to make sure your very important resume is right, how will I know you will spend the time with your internal/external communications.

* Highlight only important points.

For example you are applying for a Sr. IT position.  You have a resume with your most current position.  It lists 13 bullet points but 10 are day to day things that every admin does.  The 3 that are super amazing and will grab my attention get lost.  I am looking specifically for those 3 great achievements that show your skill, not that you can copy files on a server.

* Have a good cover letter or summary.

It is great to read a quick blurb about who you are, and your skills.  It gives some quick context to the job list and technical skills.

* Tailor your resume for the position.

Highlight things relevant to the position.  Even if you spent 50% of your time on other areas, focus on the one that applies to the job.  Include the others, but don't make it the forefront.

* Do not lie about skills.

Be comfortable answering questions about the skills that are on your resume.  If I randomly pick 5 things you have listed as skills, and you are not able to answer questions on any.  I will be questioning if you actually know anything you listed.

If anyone has any questions I can answer I would be willing to.  Also if anyone is looking for a mid career/advanced IT positions for Unix, DBA, EBS App development, Network, Security, or Windows/infrastructure/vmware then let me know.

- Teenage customer service job (finished around 2006)
- ???
- Receptionist job + other work starting from late 2011

I had a volunteer customer service job for 5 weeks in the gap period. I was thinking of extending it so that it looks like I was there for two years. I'm not misrepresenting my skill set (same type of work I did as a teenager) and I doubt I'll be asked about the ""gap"" job in interviews since there's more recent relevant work.

For the last 2 years, I have been the co-owner of a restaurant.  I'm looking to make a MAJOR change.  I don't want to manage people anymore, and I don't want to work in customer service.

My short-term plan is to find something that pays decently and offers steady work, like a factory job or something similar, while I work out what I want to do with my life long-term, like college, tech school, etc.  Do I need to write a resume to apply for a line position in a factory?

I began writing one, but I was troubled because EVERYTHING I wrote screamed that I was applying for a management position, which is EXACTLY what I do not want.  I am struggling with how to sell myself in a resume without coming across as overqualified for a menial position.  If I describe myself as an entrepreneur with tons of experience in business planning, management, human resources issues, marketing, etc., how in the world would that make someone want to hire me to stand in a line in a factory and perform the same basic task over and over?

Yet how do I downplay the management and leadership experience, without making myself seem *underqualified*, considering I have very few other ""hard"" skills outside of the business management world?  I have a lot of ""soft"" skills - computer skills, communication skills, decent math skills, etc., but nothing else that's directly applicable to any specific line of work.

In an interview situation, I feel like I could explain that I'm looking to make a career change away from the restaurant industry and away from direct store-level management, but that I will need to do some catching up financially and explore my options for college before I can settle on a career path, but I'm struggling with how to include such things in a resume without it coming across as a negative ""he's burned out"" kind of thing (although that's the truth.)",,False,,t5_2r0bv,False,,,True,t3_1e967x,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1e967x/do_i_need_a_resume_to_apply_for_bluecollar/,

I am going to explain a little further a point that several have been trying to make in this sub that seems to be overlooked.


Fancy templates and designer resumes look nice, no doubt. But they are working against you. And I am not talking about Applicant Tracking Systems here. I am talking about the science of how a resume is read.

Borders, boxes, lines, and shading just draw the eye from the most important elements of your resume and actually distract the reader. One error. ONE. And that designer resume is done. It had it’s “15 seconds of fame”. 


While errors will hurt every resume, a resume designed to be read immediately conveys your suitability for the position.

A resume designed to be read utilizes 12th grade vocabulary, an easy to read font in 10 pt or larger, and employs white space and strategic bolding to draw the eye to the most relevant information first. Namely, your headline (sometimes referred to as a branding statement), your titles held, and your education. This alone tells a hiring manager/recruiter that you are qualified. He/she really needs not read further. 


Before Applicant Tracking Systems came into play, I was a resume scanner. Companies hired me (for my experience with resumes) to look over resumes and pull the most qualified based on their position description. The resumes I always read first were the easiest to read. I found through the years that the resumes that relied less on design were also usually the most qualified candidates. 

The point is that your focus should be on making the resume as easy to read as possible, not as eye catching as possible.

I can't quite put my finger on why but have some theories, but no idea how to correct the issue.

Up until late 2010 I worked in Technical Customer Service with a strong background in IT.  The job I had moved offices to another state and I was laid off and started taking courses in CAD, something I've always wanted to do.

I thought it would be preferable to take a job for a known ""kook"" in the industry rather than unemployment so I started working for this person.  Violent and angry outbursts, general disarray, and a lack of clear goals and directions made me realize that I was wrong to take this job and I had to stop working for this person in order to finish my courses.  

I voluntarily left that place and took a job simply delivering pizzas due to the low stress and flexibility so that I could focus on going above and beyond in my courses, which I did without question, even going as far as to be a finalist in a statewide technology ""student of the year"" competition.  

Fast forward to after graduation, . .

To put it simply, mentioning ""Pizza Delivery"" as my most recent employment in the technical industry has pretty much ended the conversation with several potential employers in the CAD industry.  I've considered omitting it since it isn't relevant to CAD, but I would not want to appear that I am hiding anything from a potential employer and have no shame in admitting that I took that job in order to get through my courses.

ALSO, I am unable to ""bad mouth"" my previous employer, so I find myself repeating the overused phrase ""It was not a good fit"" when trying to explain why I left a decent paying, highly technical job in order to drive pizzas around town for considerably less.  He paid well, but was a bully and a poor owner of a company he inherited from his parents.  Simply stating that I took a pizza delivery job in order to focus on my courses doesn't seem to be enough, no matter what references I can provide from any of my previous employers including my former direct supervisors who had also left the same employer for the same reason I did.

I'm stuck!!  Any advice?

I’m a long time lurker who has recently started a software company. Let me tell you a little story…

About 18 months ago I lost my high-paying IT job. I spent a year looking for work without much luck. It's amazing what this did to my psyche. I spent a little while wallowing in the sort of self-image crisis that I have since seen and heard many others go through: the fact that I couldn't get a job *must* mean that there's something wrong with me! I must not be valuable enough! I'm just not good enough! Nobody needs me!

At one point I sat down and said, ""Wait a sec. Is the problem *really* that I have no value to offer anyone? I *know* that's BS because I regularly received accolades from my previous employer and manager, and busted my hump trying to do the best job I could. Okay, so if the problem isn't that I have no value, what *is* the problem? What's my 
alternative hypothesis?""

During most of 2012- my first year of unemployment- I used much of the time not spent looking for a job to found a non-profit that helps other people like me learn how to do a better job of promoting themselves for the purpose of advancing their career.  In the process of building a curriculum, teaching classes, and gathering feedback from the attendees I came to a startling conclusion: the way that we connect people with problems and the people who have the skills needed to *solve* those problems is fundamentally broken. 

Imagine for a moment that you run a sushi restaurant in downtown Seattle. You need a bartender who can occasionally serve as a backup sushi chef when things get busy or someone is out sick. The building that you rent is old and the pipes are constantly having issues, so someone who knows a little bit about plumbing would also be great to have around. Now, tell me, how do you go about finding a great bartender with moderate skill in rolling sushi and a little bit of plumbing skill? I would bet money that a person with that combination of skills lives in the Seattle metro area- after all, about 4 million people live there! 

Now imagine a prestigious Fortune 500 fitness company that needs to hire a Product Manager in order to deliver a new product to market. No problem- there are Product Managers all over the place, right? One wrinkle, though: they need someone who is also expert in road cycling because the product to be launched is for the cycling marketplace and they want the team leader to be knowledgeable and passionate about bikes. Now it’s probable that many people are out there that might fit that requirement set, but who puts ‘Product Manager/Road Cyclist’ on the top of their resume?

It turns out the second story is true. I spoke with a recruiter for Nike that hadn’t been able to find anyone with the Product Manager/Cyclist skill set- at the time it had been 90 days with no interviews or even candidate resumes. If Nike can’t find people with the skills that they need you know something is broken!

I started a company called StatYourself because this is a perfectly stupid problem to have and I’d like to solve it. I’m working on a tool that will allow users to describe every skill that they have – anything that they know or can do – and how good they believe they are at each. This information can be pushed out to anyone who wants to know the user’s full range of abilities. Everyone gets a unique personal URL for their profile which can be embedded just about anywhere: resume, LinkedIn profile, signature file on your email, business cards, etc. Imagine the utility of being able to say, ""Want to know everything that I might be able to do for you? Click this link!""

I hope also to derail the current trend towards rewriting your resume every time you apply for a job and replacing it with a simple and easily managed catalog of your skills that can be published globally. I can't tell you how many times I have heard people tell me that they were spending 20-40 hours per week rewriting their resume and applying online and receiving zero replies. Talk about wasted effort! 

In addition, we've noticed that job postings look a lot like database queries- ""We want a candidate who knows Javascript, CSS, and Ruby on Rails."" Well a resume isn't exactly database addressable content unless you spend a lot of time goofing around with keywords (this is one of the resume survival skills I used to teach, in fact). So far as I 
can tell we have the only truly database addressable, user submitted and unlimited skill inventory tool out there. 

Finally, I hope that we can create a model in which people have a place to go to search for the talent that they need, rather than posting a job description and hoping the correct people apply. The ""Help Wanted Sign"" approach really doesn't belong in a 21st century labor economy. 

Here’s where Reddit comes in.  Having spent many hours poring through content I know that people here are very willing to speak their mind. That’s what I need right now; I have a software prototype and I’d like to gather feedback about how well it addresses this problem and whether or not people might use it. At this point I am absolutely not selling anything, and even when we get to that point my intent is to make the core functions of the tool absolutely free, a la LinkedIn. 

You can take a look at what we have built over the last few months at http://www.statyourself.com. Please feel free to provide feedback via the feedback form on the StatYourself dashboard, any of the methods below, or by posting here. 

So…what do you think?

Thank you in advance!

If it is worth it, where do I go to find them. Searching for ""recruiter, USA, analyst"" gets me 1000 ads at places like simply hired, indeed, and USA jobs. Not surprising, not really recruiters, and I already go to those places daily to apply for jobs anyway. 

So do any of you know of good management recruiters out there? Anywhere that specializes in entry level operations, data, business, technology, and project analysis positions? 

Also, got any advice or hints? I know -Don't pay them up front- but I have no problem with paying a certain amount after my first check.  Sometimes there are recruiters that even get paid by the companies that offer the jobs.  Anything else that I should know?

I said no at the time because I have never been arrested or anything, but then I saw [this](http://www.collectionagencydebt.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-collections-affect-security.html) site, making me think that I do in fact have exactly one skeleton.  I do not want to commit a lie of omission or come off as sneaky, but I do not want to make myself look bad, either.

What happened basically is I got a job and rented a house halfway across the country.  I got laid off.  I moved out a month early because I had help to move out of state to live with my dad for free, but only for a limited time because my friend had a layover in my city so we could drive back instead of them flying back.  Planned to go back to rental house and finish cleaning up a bit (like dust the walls better and stuff), but that is easier said than done, and I did not make it back, and just mailed them their key.  They sent me a bill for $11,000 for water damage that occurred while I was not at the house for that last month.  Very unfortunate.  As I am a laid off person and not a magician, I found it difficult to conjure $11,000, so I have not paid it.

I was going to email the interviewer about the in person interview they wanted to schedule (I thought this week, but it is Wednesday, so that is not good?) as well as bring up my potential closet skeleton, but do not know how to say it without making me look bad.  I feel like if I just say I owe some money I seem shady, and if I just say I owe $11,000 without explaining it makes me look like an irresponsible shopaholic, and then if I over share I come off as awkward and...probably still seem irresponsible.

Tips please :(  I really really really really want this job.  When we spoke, the interviewer said they ""like me,"" so I dared feel hope.  Stupid me.

Edit:  Is there a better subreddit for this?  Maybe /r/jobs ?

Edit again:  Here is an email I drafted.  I think the body is probably about as good as it can get, but gosh, what to put for the subject?  Everything seems bad:

subj:  I think I do have a skeleton in my closet after all

Dear Ms. Interviewer,

I was looking up information about security clearances, and I came across a site saying that debt reflects poorly on one.  Sorry if I unintentionally mislead you, but I thought only criminal history and connections with foreign people would be of concern.  I have an $11,000 debt right now with a collection agency due to a water leak starting after moving out my house early in State after I got laid off.  I know this makes me look very irresponsible, and I do plan on paying it, but am just unable to now.  I also have about $3,000 on a credit card that I have been using often since the lay off.

Please let me know if there is anything I can and should do to improve my chances of being hired.

I was told that such a thing on a resume was a good idea because it gives employers more than just a list of credentials, but paints more of a picture of me as a person to whoever is in charge of hiring me.  It seemed like a good idea to me, but I hardly see this on any resumes posted here or elsewhere.

If anybody has experience with this, do you think it is a good idea to keep this section on my resume?  I would love to hear from some HR/hiring people.

I'm not focusing too hard on a specific type of job right now, but I feel it's worth mentioning that in the long run I hope to work in economic consulting. Though my undergrad degree isn't directly conducive to it, I've been taking intermediate economic and math courses (and doing well) which combined with a 1470 GRE (700 verbal, 770 quant, 4.0 writing) will hopefully get me into a masters program.

Some things to follow that I notice a lot of people don't do:  
  
- Make bullet points  
  
Spacing is key in your resume and many post resumes with long, drag-on paragraphs. Those paragraphs are long and big and I don't want to look at them. Think of the person looking at your resume as ADD. They want to look at your resume as quick as possible.  
  
- One Page  
  
Since recruiters are looking at your resume for six seconds, most likely they won't even reach the second page. Trim it down to one. Get rid of those 2 internships you had 5 years ago and those jobs you held as a cashier. Your most recent experience is going to be more relevant than what you did first starting out years ago.

My dad is in his mid-to-late 50s and is very worried about losing his job.  Due to financial decisions, he's not really in a place where he can think about retirement yet.  He works for a computer firm in Info Systems, and was previously a Field Engineer.

He's asking me about Resume writing services such as MyRightJob.com or others that float around on Groupon or elsewhere.  The one I mentioned in particular has a good price point.  I'm worried, though, that a lot of these services are either scams, or not very professional at all.

What would you recommend for him?  He really doesn't want to write his own, and I haven't done a resume since I was 17 (landed a job right out of college I was already working in during).

I have posted a resume for review here before and now I am back with a few additional questions. Brief background of what is on my resume. BSBA, majors in Management, Resort Area Management, and Computer and Information Systems (Concentrations in both Programming as well as Architecture and Security), and minors in Accounting, and Nonprofit Leadership Management *(lets not get caught up in how many majors/minors I have, not many jobs I'm applying for are going to need all of that educational experience)*. 

[**HERE IS MY RESUME FOR YOUR CRITIQUE**](http://i.imgur.com/8REx7F2.jpg)

The education section will change based on the position I am applying for. I'm not putting all 3 majors, 2 concentrations, and 2 minors on one resume.

* **Work experience:** 

Quite some time ago (6-9-ish years) before I left for college I was working at a family-owned restaurant. At said family restaurant I was literally doing a little bit of everything at the restaurant from the basic kitchen/lobby staff, cooking, and delivering food, to doing payroll, scheduling, conducting new hire interviews, inventory tracking, and doing purchase orders. Now the question(s)... should I/can I include this work experience? And if so should I call it a Management Trainee position? Or... what? Oh, and this family business was sold/closed shortly after I left and obviously all supervisor contacts would be family members (Uncle owned the business, mother managed it).

The 2010-2013 work experience was also family-owned where my mother is the supervisor... Our last names are not the same so it's not blatantly obvious that she is my mother. If people find out she is my mother is that going to discredit my work experience??

* **Achievements/Honors/Organizations:**

I was not a hugely successful student, boasting a 3.17 overall GPA over 196 credit hours of courses. 

1. I was one of twenty-five recipients of a business student award in 2009 and again in 2013.
2. Provost's Honor list my final two semesters (Fall '12, Spring '13)
3. One of ten finalists of a statewide business plan competition in 2013
4. Joined [Future Business Leaders of America - Phi Beta Lambda](http://www.fbla-pbl.org/) organization my final semester to compete in the state leadership conference. Won 1st place Small Business Management plan, 2nd place Business Presentation. Qualified to go to the national conference in Anaheim but school did not have the funds to send the ten students.
5. Member of [Nonprofit Leadership Alliance](http://www.nonprofitleadershipalliance.org/#sthash.cGQNA09q.dpbs) for a year or so
6. Member of an [OSIX program](http://www.fairmontstate.edu/fsunow/videos/osix-open-source-intelligence-exchange) startup at my school. This link is not my school, but it is the same thing.
7. Critical Thinking and Analytical Methods training through the [National Center for Biomedical Research and Training Academy of Counter-Terrorism Education](http://www.ncbrt.lsu.edu/) 

Should these accomplishments/achievements always come before my work/school experience since I do not really have experience applicable to the industries I'm targeting (Management, Technology, Hospitality)? There are no tech firm opportunities near my college and since I was putting myself through school I worked most summers.

I realize this is a lot to ask, but I appreciate any input!",,False,,t5_2r0bv,1371596397.0,,,True,t3_1gk8pz,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1gk8pz/a_few_questions_about_what_to_includeexclude_and/,

The problem is that when you do vendor work for a major software company, jobs come and go. One job will last three months, and then the next one will last a year and a half. Then you're back to three months again. It looks like I can't hold a job. And it also appears that I started working full time in 2003, because my full-length work history would be four pages long.

Compounding that is the fact that while I have a really heavy Operations background, I've recently been dabbling in SDET work. It turns out that I'm not cut out for it, so I'm wanting to get back into Ops. Unfortunately, employers are looking at my last two jobs and wondering why the hell an SDET is wanting to be a Systems Administrator. 

I feel like I need to change my resumé to a skills-based one, but the problem is that I'm not sure I have enough hard skills that actually look good on a resumé. Is there anyone here that has experience in IT resumés that can help me turn this... *monstrosity* into something more worthy of attention? I can pay you.

I have a college degree and people tell me that these kinds of places don't like to hire people who are ""overqualified""... Should I leave it off?

1329768903.0,8,self.resumes,py7wt,Aheaders: Resume Lessons from Feedback Weekend,aheaders,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/py7wt/aheaders_resume_lessons_from_feedback_weekend/,"As some of you had seen: Aheaders held a Resume Feedback Weekend this past weekend. For our loyal readers, we provided a free resume review and we wanted to share some of the lessons we learned about resumes in general...

**1) Be Accomplishment-Oriented, Not Responsibility-Oriented**
Probably the biggest issue we saw with most resumes is the most common thing about resumes: they list duties. Listing responsibilities is great to show what you've done or what you were supposed to do, but it has never made anyone stand out. You want to be accomplishment oriented. So rather than ""Worked on project with Director of Marketing to roll out new marketing campaign,"" you should focus on what you accomplished and how you did it...""Partnered with Director of Marketing to roll out new marketing campaign that increased sales 20% month-over-month."" 

Sure, not every task can be written this way, but that's why your resume isn't a list of duties; they're just accomplishments. They should answer the question: what have you done at your job that wasn't expected when you were hired? If it isn't a main achievement, leave it out.

**2) Drop the Objective/Summary/About Me**
This one is subjective, but the objective, in our opinion, did not add a single thing to any resume. Each resume said that the objective was to find a Job in X field where they can use Talents A, B, and C. Reading resumes back-to-back only highlighted that they were all the same and did nothing to make any candidate stand out. Just leave it out.

**3) Be Anal about Format**
Not everyone is going to be as vigilant about indents and margins, but on first glance, when something doesn't look right, it's very off-putting. So if your right-side margin doesn't match your left or you indent too much on one side or the spacing looks odd or you change fonts halfway through, readers pick it up pretty quickly. Remember, your goal is to get your resume read. Don't give anyone a reason to put your resume down, especially not because it's unattractive for a silly reason.

**4) Almost Always: Bullets instead of Paragraphs**
Again, you're trying to give people every reason NOT to put your resume down and that includes having it be easy to read. No one likes reading dense texts (ironic, this post is kind of dense, sorry). But no one enjoys reading that. If you're describing your duty, the company, your accomplishments, use bullets.

Those were the biggest things we saw in most resumes. If nothing else, remember this: your resume should make you stand out, not sink into a crowd. So your resume shouldn't tell things that others have done (i.e. ""Organized and maintained client files""); if that's all you did, they can find anyone to do that. You are only a step above someone who hasn't done that, but chances are...someone who hasn't done that isn't applying for that job. You want to show what you've done AHEAD of someone who's also organized and maintained client files. Stand out. 

Be accomplishment oriented and don't give them a silly reason to put your resume aside.

No engineering background is required, they send you to classes to learn what to do.

I am relatively well spoken, I've given formal scientific presentations yet in interviews I've been scoffed at and told that my skills are outsourced and jobs that I'm qualified for are done by others for peanuts.

&gt;Do I have to list all of my positions on the resume?
&gt;You want to make sure that the information you are including in the resume is relevant to the position. Leave off or significantly scale back out-of-date or unrelated positions. This way, readers will focus more on recent and relevant experience instead of getting distracted by information that does not add as much value.
&gt;
&gt;Furthermore, if you include jobs such as barista, cashier, server, lifeguard etc. - it can be reasonably expected that anyone reading your resume will know what kind of responsibilities these jobs typically involve. Including bullet points like ""handled cash and assisted customers with checkout"" or ""prepared beverages"" are generally unhelpful and at worst emphasize a lack of pertinent skills or accomplishments. If you only have cashier/server/retail experience, try to emphasize things that you did that are unique, such as maintaining a 100% attendance record or re-merchandising an endcap to improve sales of X product by Y%.

I just wanted to get some extra input though. When I was 21 and under, I worked at Best Buy, Gamestop, and Sprint, but I feel it is not necessary to list these jobs on the resume since I just did grunt work. So I guess my question is, will it look odd with just the one job listed?

Also I am working on getting a degree and only have 43 credit hours with a 3.93 GPA, should this be listed also?

Ugh I hate this.  I tend to not sell myself so great.  I already deleted a part about me being not very experienced in C as that does not scream ""pick me, pick me"" but I feel like a liar not saying it.  If it matters, I came across this lab just on the website, not a ""for hire"" place, so it is unsolicited.  Here is what I have.  With the address up top it is an entire page.  Isn't this too long?


professor blah

here
in this city and state

Dear (I say D.r, not Ms., right? Should there be a blank line after this or not?),

I am eager to introduce myself as a potential developer of software in your RNA structure prediction lab.  (too short?  combine with other paragraph or just add to this one?)

As a recipient of a Bachelor’s of Science in Electrical Engineering from INSERTCOLLEGE in May, 2008 I have been educated in several programming languages, and, coupled with over ten years of experience in software development, I feel confident that I will be able to contribute to your project though I am just beginning my changeover to biology.

A greater asset than my aforementioned education may be my genuine enjoyment of this kind of work.  As a student, I would look forward to both math and computer science homework.  I enjoy integrations and Fourier, Laplace, and Z transforms by hand because they are akin to logic puzzles, much like I imagine folding RNA is due to my playing of the fold.it game, and spent many hours working on assembly code in the digital design lab my senior year without realizing just how long I had been sitting in that hard stool.  This engrossment effortlessly results in a great work ethic.  I also greatly enjoy Matlab, as that is *programming math*, my two greatest joys.

There are two reasons I am moving away from electrical engineering despite greatly enjoying certain aspects.  The first is that in my previously employment I felt apathetic to my work.  If I were to actually help someone—maybe even myself, one day, as dementia and diabetes run in my family—I would get much more fulfillment out of my days.  I also feel the inner workings of life are more interesting than that of a power supply.

You asked me what kind of work situation I am looking for, and I am hoping to get research experience before I commit more time and money in reeducating myself, possibly going so far as to apply to the (this program in this school).  Any sort of financial compensation, health insurance, tuition waiver, or college credit would be incredibly helpful, as well.  The hours I would be able to work would depend on if and if and how much of my living expenses this position would provide, but I believe even if I had a full time job outside of the university, I could spend 15 hours per week on your software.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and am more eager to work on this project than any others I have come across regardless of the role I would be assigned.

Thank you,

**Looking for good examples of a ""skills-based"" resume format to model; your suggestions appreciated.**

Basically I worked in the corporate sector as a non-technical ""jack-of-all-trades"" business-analyst (in 'IT') for close to 10 years (did a little of everything, but I was an expert at nothing in particular, except ultimately the inner-workings of the company's legacy computer systems).

Then I worked for 7 years at an environmental non-profit doing (of all things) primarily work related to recycling education.

I also have a fair bit of meaningful volunteer work I'd really like to mention, and somehow mention *beyond* just a bullet-point at the end of the resume (i.e. somehow mention the skills I've used in my volunteer work too -- like doing audience-development work for a professional symphony orchestra, and producing a successful jazz-concert series for 5 years, and leading a couple stewardship campaigns that started to get an organization out of a stewardship model that was 20 years out-of-date, as well as fund-raising close to $10,000 for music organization that I was the volunteer director/conductor of, and I also organized a historic neighborhood home and gardens tour (the first one ever in our neighborhood), while serving as the VP of the neighborhood association).

Also, I just moved 1,000 miles from the midwest to the east-coast (for my wife's job) -- so I'm basically starting back at ZERO in terms of knowing anyone, and being able to network.

**TL;DR:** In short, my work-history alone paints a pretty bland and boring picture of who I am (because I've really only held two full-time jobs my entire nearly 20-year career) -- but the range of things I've been involved in and accomplished is MUCH bigger than my ""work-history"".  Or at least I'd sure like to think so, and hope I can convince employers of that too.",,False,,t5_2r0bv,False,,,True,t3_idaaj,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/idaaj/good_examples_wanted_to_help_revamp_my/,

FrozenYo


I am writing this letter to apply for a job opportunity at FrozenYo. I was recently walking near the FrozenYo shop in downtown Silver Spring when I noticed a help wanted sign outside the shop. I went in and enjoyed a great bowl of yogurt then later approached the employe asking him about the sign. After talking to him for a couple minutes he brought it to my attention that I need to create a resume and apply through mail or online. So i'm applying in an attempt to get this job at the FrozenYo in downtown Silver Spring.
When I saw there was an opportunity for employment here, I was very excited at the possibility of becoming part of the team. I have been a regular customer at FrozenYo since the opening and I feel like if I get the opportunity I can be an assist to the team. My experience at the farmers market will allow me to work well with the customers and also the cashier experience that I have acquired will allow me to work well when handling money.
Thank you for considering me for the position at FrozenYo and I will follow up by sending an email to one of the addresses on the FrozenYo website. 
Respectfully yours,

Dear Principal Egan,

I am writing this letter to express my interest in the second grade teaching position open in your school.  I am certified to teach grades K-8 in New Jersey, and my certificate is standard.  I hold a CEAS to teach Students with Disabilities.  In addition, I am CPI certified.

I taught fourth grade for six years in {school district}.  I was responsible for teaching all subjects, and served as the grade level chairperson.  During my years of teaching, I developed lessons that reached the varied levels of ability in my classroom.  It is essential to develop lessons that keep students engaged in the learning process, and utilize their strengths to help develop areas of opportunity.  I earned tenure in {school district}, and my performance was rated as ""exceeding expectations.""

After taking time to raise my children, I am ready to resume employment as a classroom teacher.  Currently, I am an In-Class Support Instructor for grades 1-3 in the {School District}. This step as an In-Class Support Instructor for multiply disabled children has helped me to see education from their point of view, and with their special needs in mind.  The experiences gained through this year will further help me with my future regular education students.  

I utilize the Wilson “Fundations” program and Fountas &amp; Pinnell’s LLI Program in my daily teaching.  I have experience planning lessons that adhere to the CCCS, and I attended workshops that focused on the Danielson Evaluation model. I am fully versed in teaching math using the Everyday Math program for grades K-5.

My combined experiences make me a strong candidate for the elementary position available in Westville.  I look forward to meeting with you to discuss our mutual interests.

My questions -

1. ""To whom it may concern"" or ""Dear Hiring Manager"" when no specific name is listed on the posting?

2. I'm tailoring cover letters to specifics in the job posting - for this sample, the job I applied to is mostly administrative work, but some research support too.  Did I succeed in highlighting the right experience?

3. I'm trying to give a glimpse into my personality and life experience in my cover letters.  Is this a good idea?  Am I doing it well?

4. I'm an older college grad - I'll be 30 soon but I just got my bachelors.  How does this affect my prospects?  Should I convey that I am more mature than the average college grad or avoid revealing that detail?

Any other feedback would be much appreciated (resume format, syntax, etc).

I was there from time to time (many times over the years, though) and they didn't pay me to ""work"", I just observed and helped when they needed it. I'd help unpack the items at the beginning of the day and help pack it all back up at the end, I'd watch the table when they needed a bathroom break or something to eat, helped wrap and bag customers items, and of course handled money when someone bought something. One summer they gave me my own table at the flea markets they'd go to and encouraged me to find my own ""thing"". I bought and sold video games as well as Pokemon cards and some other collectibles. I made a pretty penny and it was quite a learning experience! **Now how do I put that on a resume?** I guess I am most concerned with whether or not I can place anything besides that four month period where I actually made money and was there on a regular basis on it?

Other than that all I've got is my GED which I got about two years ago and I've been volunteering at a small library in an early years center for the past year.

At the library I'm responsible for a lot of librarian duties as I am alone there for my shift and I run the front (and only) desk. Duties include: Checking items in and out for members, shelving items, checking inventory, answering phones, tidying up the library, and helping members with the computers and printing. I also handle cash fairly often as we sell (used) books, offer a Toy Lending Membership, and incur overdue and printing fees. There have been some one or two time duties I've done as well such as photocopying, creating bulletin boards, using die cuter, filing, ect.

**Instead of getting a regular job, like most kids, I spent my teen years going door-to-door shoveling driveways in the winter and mowing lawns in the summer. Any point in somehow placing that on there too?**

The jobs I am going for are entry-level retail positions (pet stores, grocery, ect). I am thinking of applying at a local Once Upon a Child because I think a number of my skills would fit in nicely there. Thoughts?

Right now I am going to work toward getting an Engineering Internship, I need this experience for both my personal and professional development, now, I decided to come to Reddit and I've found great advice, but I am a little troubled about 'Objective Statements', Reddit tells me:

* [Objectives are generally a waste of real estate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/faq#wiki_what_should_i_write_in_my_objective.3F)
* [Do not include an objective. It really doesn't mean anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/kxn25/the_most_frequent_advice_i_give_about_resumes/)
* [I hire people. I hate objectives on resumes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/18ek10/rant_i_hire_people_i_hate_objectives_on_resumes/)
* [I don't like objectives. objective for a resume is to GET HIRED.](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10wpjl/i_help_hire_people_will_critique_resumes/c6htw8d)

So it seemed to be the common denominator here, so I decided to drop my ""Objective"" and instead converted in into a ""Personal Profile"" (as suggested [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/10wpjl/i_help_hire_people_will_critique_resumes/c6hdm7n)).

Now, I was pretty happy with my decision, I've started applying upon doing some work on my resume, while doing so I came to find that some of the companies have some ""Resume Tips"", where I found the following: 

* [Objective - to formulate a solid objective try to answer the following questions. What is it you really want to do? For whom? Where? At what level of responsibility?](http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/content.do?id=16307) 

* [A career objective explains why your resume is in the reader's hands. It is a simple statement about your employment goals. It should immediately follow your name and contact information.](http://www.maximintegrated.com/company/careers/career-opportunities/resume-tips.cfm)

So this makes me feel like they are expecting an Objective Statement, I feel like my ""Personal Profile"" would cover that, but I am afraid that because they give this resume tips they are expecting an Objective Statement and from not getting it I'd be immediately disqualified and it also makes me wonder about what other companies could be expecting this as well.



**TL;DR** - **Had an objective, changed it for a 'Profile' upon browsing the Top posts on /r/resumes, then found out some employers encourage to add an objective.**

So /r/resumes,

* Do you think I should stick to my 'Profile' or go back to an 'Objective'?
* What's your opinion on objectives?
* For those of you that have gotten hired, did you have an 'Objective'?
* Hiring managers (if there are any around), What's your opinion?

Please critique and don't hold back!,tjs123,6,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1cme3l/cover_letter_for_local_business_buildcom_please/,"My name is xxxx xxxx and this is exactly why you should consider hiring me onto the build.com crew…because I am awesome! I recently graduated from California State University-Chico with a Bachelors Degree of Science in Business Management. I’m a Chicoan through and through, and have a passion for the city of Chico that can only be seen to be believed. Currently, I’m in the stage of my life where growing my professional career with a compatible company is one of my top priorities. Advancing my career may be the most important aspect of my life, but like any normal person my hobbies of snowboarding and disc golf come in a close second place. I personally live by your company culture of “work hard, play hard”. Getting the job done is always first priority, but once that job is completed its time to relax and have some fun!

My personality can be described as upbeat and charismatic. Personally, I do no fear failure because you only can learn and grow from mistakes made. This attitude is consistently displayed in my work affairs, as well as my personal life. A prime professional example of this can be seen when recently I was given the task of over-hauling an entire inventory system because it was not performing accurately.  Yes, the thought of complete failure sat in the back of my head and tried to influence my judgment when unseen complications arose. The average Joe/Jill would have crawled into a corner and waited for someone to come to rescue them when the times got tough, but not me! I confronted any fear with a superb attitude and used the fear as motivation to guide me to the solutions to fix the problems.

Throughout my life I have been told that I have a knack for absorbing what I am told. My brain has been compared with a sponge by a variety of people because of its ability to soak in information (hopefully they weren’t just calling my brain soft). This uncanny ability to learn new ideas and processes is consistent with my track-record of undertaking projects which are unfamiliar, then excelling and mastering the ins-and-outs of the entire project. During college, I undertook a series of projects that ranged from creating a videotaped public service announcement to putting on an entire theatrical performance. Every project I started was completed on time and under budget with no sacrifice to quality.  Less than a year ago, I received my CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) certification from the Project Management Institute.

My first post is [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1bmfkr/rough_draft_of_my_first_resume_since_graduating/). I got some good advice. Thanks to everyone that commented or PMed me.

First I would like to point out the the ""relevant coursework"" section has a bunch of classes in it. I tailor these to fit the job I'm applying. So, any given resume would only have a fraction of those courses. No more than 2 lines.

**A little info about me copied from the last post**  I just finished my degree in International Relations and I'm looking to work for a couple of years to gain some experience before applying to some quality MBA programs. The jobs I've been looking at are mostly in either the Business arena or for NGO's/Non-Profits/Diplomatic Services. It is also worth mentioning that the Resume is 1page long in Word, but for some reason slightly over in the google doc.


**Things I changed from the 1st draft:**

1.Changed font. I like the Calibri better than Times New Roman

2.Added Years to my education

3.Moved Work history (renamed Professional Experience) ahead of skills and behind Education.

4.Removed Special Ed Teaching Assistant from skills to Professional History and fleshed it out a bit.

5.Added a couple of lines to the Referee job.

Looking at jobs in either the Business field or for NGO's/Non-profits/Diplomatic services for a couple of years before a MBA. All help appreciated!,DerogatoryPanda,7,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1bmfkr/rough_draft_of_my_first_resume_since_graduating/,"[Here is my First Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ut2hxaTVgYkxpNFt0V9fYXkLbzUES1VEJXqobEFKpLk/edit?usp=sharing)

It is pretty rough. Sorry! I just finished my degree in International Relations and I'm looking to work for a couple of years to gain some experience before applying to some quality MBA programs. The jobs I've been looking at are mostly in either the Business arena or for NGO's/Non-Profits/Diplomatic Services. It is also worth mentioning that the Resume is 1page long in Word, but for some reason slightly over in the google doc.

Please give me any advice you can!

That said, there are a few areas in particular that I would like opinions on:


1. Font/Formatting. I really just kind of winged it here. Is the Font too big or small? Is they layout particularly poor?


2. Do I need to put the years I was getting my degree next to the degree in the education section? When I tried it, it looked cluttered and I wasn't too happy with it so I removed it.


3. How much coursework should I put in the ""relevant coursework section? I tend to tailor the courses listed to the job I'm applying for so it will in most cases be about half of what I have listed for you all. I think its necessary to list at least some as it shows knowledge of the field that I can't really convey with my week work history.


4. The skills section is a little unusual, but it makes up for the work history a bit and allows me to flesh out my character a little bit more without simply listing some generic stuff like ""strong work ethic and desire to succeed"" that seem a bit cliche to me. Thought? Should I have just gone a more generic route?


5. Old jobs. Aside from my internship experience, I worked as both a cashier and a Soccer referee. Neither are directly relevant to my career aspirations now. Should I include either of them? Just leaving the Internship made the section seem even weaker, so I included the Referee position as it seems to show some coordination and management ability. The people that interviewed me for my internship also liked it.


6. Is my year placement on my work history ok? It seems kind of strange to me, but I couldn't figure out a better option.


7. Should I say ""Intern at a Global Non-Profit""? That was my job, but I'm not sure if it is frowned upon to actually say you were an Intern. I could just use the title ""Global Non-Profit Peace One Day"", but then it makes it seem like I was more than an intern for Peace One Day (name of the non-profit).

I have been out of work for a few years now (one income household), and I'm currently looking for part time work. Most of the positions I plan on applying to will most likely not require a resume, but I thought this might be the best place to ask.

Here's a little background that might be helpful:
I had steady employment up until 2009. I worked in the financial industry (not customer facing) and we were hit pretty hard, however I voluntarily left my position to relocate out of state. I was promised another job in the new state. Well, I relocated there and suddenly that position was ""cut"" and I was left without a job. I found general office temp work a few months later, but only for a month because their ""contract ran out"" with the temp agency. I was assured I'd be hired back after they decided a budget, but I was not. A few months after that I moved back to the original state to look for better employment. That took awhile, and I found another temp job on par with pre-financial work experience. However, the position I had was with a sub-contract with another company. Basically I was hired to company A through the temp, but my position was is company A-1. A-1 went belly up, and so did the whole department. That job lasted about 6 months. This last position was up in August of 2010.

My husband and I agreed to go one income from then on. I started my own business, but it was more just something to pass the time. I never made any real money at it, and here comes my problem. Do I include this on my resume or even job apps to account for lost time? How exactly am I supposed to word what was really just part time self employment?

Along with this self employment, I have quite a bit of volunteer work. Does this belong on the resume? If so, where? What about the job app?

And how do I write the objective section if I've got skills in a lot of different areas, and I will honestly take just about any work I could find. I'm not picky at all (office, retail, logistics, etc), but I don't want to come off as too desperate. 

I suppose I should have started with this - My job history is pretty erratic (lots of different areas - retail, customer service, problem resolution, team leads, etc. etc.), so how do I choose what information I put on my resume, or do I just put it all on there? How far back is it supposed to go? What if I don't remember dates? (and for that matter - what if I don't remember manager names? Or phone numbers? What if the business is no longer there?)


Ok, so  this ended up being a lot more questions than I had anticipated, and I apologize. Any help you can throw my way would be greatly appreciated!

I am looking for work that I can do in the evenings, and have no intention of quitting the day job. Think: delivery driver, waiter, convenience store, and other flexible jobs like that. 

Writing a resume is proving difficult, because (outside of a 2 month stretch as a video store clerk out of school, and a 10 month long contract at a community TV station) I have been working for myself since graduation and completely forget what a resume looks like. I'm not quite sure how to present five years or self employment in one field. I also do not want a potential employer to think I'm overqualified, or assume I am going to quit after a month. I honestly believe that if a job is the right fit, I can stay for a long time.

Two things to note:

Branding statement: does that work? It feels weird doing it for a low level part time work resume. If the target audience were my clients, then I wouldn't have a problem, but it seems difficult to demonstrate how you would be valuable as, say, a clerk, without being too generic. The only things that pop into my mind for this kind of resume is stuff like ""I will be a dependable, hard working..."" yadda yadda....

The clients listed in my work experience are all names of companies that the average person will know. Does listing them by name make me come across as overqualified? Or worse, make them wonder ""If he's so good, why can't he support himself with this recognizable client list?""

I've recently moved from Denmark to England and am now looking for part time work while I finish my master's thesis (due in April). At the moment, I'm only planning on sending my CV to a few recruitment agencies, so for now it's not aimed at any particular position. I hope to eventually end up in a job that makes use of my passion for communication and writing, maybe copy writing,  but to be honest, I'll probably apply for anything and everything I feel qualified for while I'm still studying. Once I find a position I want to apply for, I will, of course, tweak my CV to fit that position :)

Anyway, I'd love to hear any criticism you might have! I have a few questions you might be able to help me with:

First of all, should I add my LinkedIn profile to my contact information?

Secondly, I've added some really irrelevant work experience, only to show that I have lived and worked in England before. Should I get rid of it? And if so, what should I add to fill the space? More space between lines? A few bullet points regarding my degree?

I've been full hired for the first 12.5 years of my 14 year IT career (the last 1.5 years being a consultant). My contract ended and the consulting firm I worked through doesn't specialize in IT jobs (they are a pharma staffing company that happened to get an IT position when I was last looking).

I get calls from recruiters for positions, at least 3-4 a week. None of those ever pan out to real interviews though. 

My resume scored an A- on a (seemingly) popular resume review site that I found in the comments of a thread here earlier today. I won't mention the site as it seems the last time I listed a resource I was using my thread was removed (for advertising, I'm assuming). With a score like that I assume that either that site is bullshit in analyzing resumes, or my content/presentation is okay and there is something else missing.

So I (and my wife as she's tired of me being home 24/7... though my three kids are enjoying having daddy home all summer) ask the good community here at r/resume to tear this thing apart and help me get a job. 

Edit 1:  In the Organizational Affiliation section I list two Board of Directors positions I hold. They are both for educational groups. The President position is for the non-profit private preschool my kids go to. The Technology Chairman position is for a private K-8 school my oldest went to for kindergarten.

My situation is somewhat unusual. I will be going back to college full time beginning next month and do not currently want a full time position. My monthly expenses (rent, bills, phone, insurance, groceries) only add up to about $500 per month total so while more money is always nice my main focus isn't pay but rather how close it is to my home and school.

I would love to find something related to my chosen field but have not been able to so I have decided to apply at grocery stores, restaurants, etc. The trouble that I am having is that I have fairly solid professional work experience and that seems to be a deterrent to these types of employers.

Most of these employers require applications rather than resumes but those still use the same information. I also want to create a resume that speaks to my overall office skills that would be appropriate for independent local businesses.

I have already left out a lot of things (I was the manager of training and quality for multiple accounts not just an instructional designer at the call center) and have focused mainly on my writing and editing experiences because that is my chosen field. I just need to find the best way to spin this as a usable resume for a standard office or retail worker.

One hand I would think it would show that I'm academically qualified (aka not stupid) and that I most likely wouldn't have a problem with new tech and diving into advanced topics. I would also think it shows that I didn't skirt by on the bare minimum and that I'm always willing to learn. I also have some lower level certifications.

On the other hand I think it would send the message that I wouldn't dedicate my self to the job like an employer would like and be in danger of them thinking that I would mostly focus on school.

The place where I got my BS isn't known for IT. It's actually a Liberal Arts school and is best known for its teaching degree. My MS school is a known technology/engineering school.

I have a few questions for the seasoned resume readers around here:

1. I read somewhere that you should try to quantify your bullet points whenever possible. Did I go overboard? I threw numbers everywhere, but I'm not very good at them (probably because I'm an English major).

2. How's the formatting? I wanted a crisp, modern looking font, so I went with Helvetica Ultra Light. I also tried to condense as much onto one page as I could. Ideally, everything would be on one page. Any advice there? Is the bullet-point font too small?

3. In order to truncate the resume, I took off a couple of pretty significant extracurricular leadership positions because they weren't literary-oriented like the others. Was that a mistake?

4. Are there any sections that I really don't need? Am I missing something? I do have a few related courses, but it seems that I'm already pressed for space. I also thought about including a branding statement, but I also plan on attaching cover letters (and maybe even writing samples) for a lot of these applications, so I wasn't sure if it was totally necessary.

There's a video game pawn shop kind of place that just opened up a few weeks ago and so far it's the best chance I have at getting a job. I talked with the main guy there and he said to send in an application. He'll be hiring by summer. I want to get the drop on it before I lose my chance and working at a video game shop would be awesome. I absolutely love video games and this would be a job that fit me for the time being.

1336100954.0,6,self.resumes,t699o,"3 years out of school (physics degree), no relevant experience, no luck, need to start trying again...",NameTaken25,8,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/t699o/3_years_out_of_school_physics_degree_no_relevant/,"People say a lot ""Don't worry, its the economy, it'll work out""

No. It isn't. Its me. And I want to fix that. 

I got a physics degree from a pretty good school, but it has been a while, and I feel pretty clueless. I do think I could relearn things pretty quick, and am a quick learner in general, and most places would want to do some inhouse training anyway. I do still want to get into that field, I think, but I don't know if I'm even viable. Assuming that I am, I need to rebuild/update my (shitty) resume, and get a cover letter or two done.

I'm a little unsure how to format things and what to include. I did undergraduate research in the physics department for a summer, but it was a pretty shitty experience, and I didn't really get anything out of it. I was, at best, a glorified assistant to a prof chasing down stupid and deadend leads/connections, for the most part. The sciency things are pretty few and lame. Include it or no? Other UGs at my school were doing things with nanotechnology and particle accelerator data, and cloud chambers, etc. Similar story with my senior research. It was a good experience, but it doesn't look/sound impressive (helped modernize an old experiment, and introduce it to a junior level physics lab course).

In the 3 years since graduation, I've been officially unemployed a lot of it, but I have had a part time job at a department store for a holiday season, and now I've been employed since last Nov. working in a health center/old folks home/rehab sort of place, washing dishes, plating meals, serving food, restocking stuff, etc. In between these official jobs, I've done a smattering of landscaping, painting, yardworky jobs to get by. I don't know how/if to include those in any way on the resume as a ""Hey, I wasn't a complete and total loser/bum since graduation"". 

References. I feel like my academia references would be necessary but not very good. It has been a while, and while I wasn't a bad student, I wasn't standout either. I do have some decent references from the last 3 years I think though. Some of the people I landscaped with or for. The guy who told me about my current job is a highup at the place (but didn't do the hiring), and has said stuff like ""you're the best thing to ever happen to this place since I started (15ish years ago)"" and ""I hear so many good reports about you"" etc. My bosses/coworkers seem pleased as well. Not sure who else I could use as a reference. I doubt my UG research adviser/prof would even remember me much, and I don't know how much of an impression I made on my senior research adviser, doubt he'd have much to say reference-wise and it'd be pretty weird to contact him out of the blue and go ""Hey, remember the forgettable guy you haven't heard from in years, would you be willing to chat me up to other strangers?""

But anyway, I'm not sure if I should have a ""References available on request"" second and plain page, if I should just have a second page for references included with the resume, or if I should find a way to squeeze it all into 1 page. My most-current (out of date by 1 job, and still poor besides) resume has a ""upon request"" thing. But I've never gotten a single call back. But I also haven't applied to nearly as many places as I should.

Cover letters, I'm really unsure where to even begin with, but I think one step at a time, and resume comes first. To be honest, I really don't even know what to apply for anymore, especially after so long. But I think being so clueless about how to job search, and resume/cover letter write is largely what threw me into this nasty rut in the first place.

I have my out of date resume, but I think starting from scratch might not be a bad idea. But either way, I'm willing to blot out some names and numbers and let people take a look at it, but I'm not sure how best to do that... email? copy/paste? screenshot?

I realize I probably sound retarded (and I haven't convinced myself I'm not) but I would really appreciate help. Whenever I start up this stuff on my own I get no where, and it is frustrating the hell out of me.

I am applying for a post as a research associate.

I have held a research position since I entered the working world.  While working as an Assistant Psychologist for the NHS, I carried out many different projects, many published in respected psychological journals.  In my main role, I worked alongside Side Kick studios, an innovative social design firm.  This project introduced me to the concept and importance of user centred design.  My work on the project involved developing activities for the prototyping and usability of the Buddy radio (http://sidekickstudios.net/projects/buddy/).  My involvement in the project was in part due to my experience in mental health, as an assistant psychologist with the NHS.  We were involved in the project from its fruition, and I had to leave the position to complete my MSc dissertation.

I studied Psychology as an undergraduate at the University of Manchester, and after learning more about the direction I wanted to take my career in through Buddy, I decided on studying Research Methods at Goldsmith’s, University of London.  This degree will be completed in the middle of September. 

I come from an eclectic background, having lived in 8 cities, in 4 countries and hence have a good understanding of cultural differences.   My experience in working with multi-disciplinary teams within the advertising, health and design sectors has made me an excellent communicator, skilled group worker, organized, accurate and efficient.  I feel my interests and experience are ideal for this project, as my hunger for knowledge and success makes me a dedicated employee.

Dear Crossroads Team,

I recently graduated with a degree in veterinary technology and am seeking full time employment as a veterinary technician in the Columbia area.  *name removed* referred me to your clinic and mentioned that you were seeking to fill a position. I took the VTNE August 12th and was given a preliminary 'pass' result which will allow me to become credentialed after I receive the official scores.    	

During my time in school I interned at three locations, each unique in what they had to offer both clients and students.  I've had the opportunity to learn from an excellent group of people that have taught me how to work effectively on a team as well as the the inner workings of a veterinary hospital, and I would love to use these skills in your practice. I'm looking for a clinic willing to take on a new graduate and foster those skills and abilities attained in school for the benefit of both the patients and the practice.  

I appreciate you taking the time to review my credentials and experience and would love to set up a time to interview.  I can be contacted by phone at *phone number removed* or email at *email removed*.  Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.






000000000000000000000000000

I'm just not sure what to say.  I'm a new graduate with no experience in the field other than my internships and a job I had for three weeks that I hesitate to even mention because the owner went crazy and fired everybody in the clinic, not to mention her terrible standing with area vets.  I really only have being new to offer.  Can be molded and instructed however they need.  =/  Which isn't always what people want.

I've worked in customer service for quite a long time, and it's really taken a toll on me.

Long-story short, he's gotten too comfortable with me, and shares inappropriate information about me, out loud, in front of other associates.

I'm shooting for a position within a data center, but it seems like the necessary qualifications are beyond me.

**Edit**: [Talked with a friend after posting this and he made a few suggestions, so updated resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5qIkkwpOYjslhFeOE2OX9B67FumYm8tHM6SmEAOxWs/edit?usp=sharing)

So I'm 32 years old and was laid off last year from the hotel I worked at for almost 9 years.  I didn't need a resume for that job as I knew the bartender at the hotel's bar and he introduced me to the front desk manager and I got the job almost immediately. I moved cross country and am now trying to apply for another hotel as after a year of trying stuff like Wal-Mart and Albertsons hasn't gotten me anything (I liked the night auditor job, I just wanted to see about finding something that was more a ""regular"" shift than going back to overnights).

My resume feels like it's lacking.  Since I worked at the hotel for 9 years, I only have the 1 job in the experience section (Worked at Wal-Mart for 2 years before that, but didn't include it).  When I graduated high school (which I think it's anything that important to put on a resume as I assume most people graduated high school) I went to the community college, but never completed it and dropped out as working at Wal-Mart and going to school was becoming too difficult.  Other than that, I'm not sure what else I should add (or how to add it). I am thinking of taking out the summary part after reading some articles, but decided to go ahead and post the resume here anyway.

At the previous hotel job the hotel closed for major renovations and everyone was laid off.  At the time of closing I was the second longest employeed person there (even longer than the manager).  I never took a sick day.  I was always the one that was called in when they needed someone to work extra because another employee couldn't make it in/had to leave early.  I worked in Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina (doesn't sound important but it's a HUGE thing and worth noting because of how extreme the situation was for hotels during that time). When almost every front desk person quit/was fired, my manager and I worked 12 hour shifts for several weeks until we could get new people hired properly. I am proud of how extremely reliable I was at this job.

Sorry for the long post (another thing I'm finding difficult with making a resume, being brief).

Need resume advice for transitioning from a nanny to legal field.,ineedajobthrowaway,6,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1ilt90/recent_grad_need_resume_advice_for_transitioning/,"I graduated in Spring 2012 with a BA in sociology. After that I worked abroad as a nanny and took language courses while I traveled Europe. I just returned to the US 3 weeks ago. I also worked all through college as a nanny, making that 5 years experience. I really don't have any other work, intern or volunteer experience besides that. I have proficient computer skills but nothing else gained through work experience that isn't childcare related, such as CPR and Infant CPR certified.

I'm not really sure how to present myself in the best light on my resume- I worked minimum of 30 hours per week and paid for college myself.

I want to enter law school in fall '15 and would really like to work in a legal setting. I just don't even know how to get started on this. When I applied for nanny jobs, I got my positions through word of mouth recommendations, or a popular nanny site.

I have a few concrete questions- 

* Since I graduated in 2012, should I put my education or work experience first? I think it's best to market myself as a ""recent grad"" but am not quite sure.

* Should I even put my work as a nanny abroad on my resume? Someone suggested that I don't even mention it unless asked and just put that I traveled Europe and took intensive French courses for a year. The problem with this is that my boss is a great reference for me.


* Where is everyone getting these awesome formats?


Also wanted to add...
I am about to turn 26. It took me nearly 6 years to graduate due to money issues. During that time I worked in two retail settings. The first one, I worked for over a year, but then I began taking full time classes. My work performance started to slip, so I ended up quitting. That was 2007-2008 when I began nannying. My second job was another retail position from like July 2011-October 2012. It was only a summer support position but they kept me on a little longer. I am wondering if I should include these jobs because a) I don't have a reference from the first company, their policy is to not give out references, only the dates of hire. And secondly, because I know I could easily pass for 21-23, therefore making my unimpressive work experience more excusable. Should I put the second job on my resume, because I only worked there for a short period of time?",,False,,t5_2r0bv,1374203246.0,,,True,t3_1ilt90,http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1ilt90/recent_grad_need_resume_advice_for_transitioning/,

* The general wording of the skills I highlight under each position, is there anyway these can be stronger? 

* My sales associate position was summer only and I formatted it in to two time periods. Does it look better this way? Or is it better to have the year's span and note that it was a summer job. Like - Summer Season May 2012-August 2013

I'm wondering, however, what future potential employers might think of it? While I suspect having a job in Antarctica on my resume will certainly get some attention, I worry that it might make me appear eccentric or somehow reckless.

[CV](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzaW3g9MvFuQX1BFbU42a09MTGc/edit?usp=sharing)

**Notes on CV**:
How else can I phrase 'acting undergraduate'? It was a residential course where we were supposed to experience the life of an undergraduate, but I'm not sure how to describe that in a word or two.

Also, should I include the 'Selbourne Society'? I need to keep it to one page and I'm not sure what to cut out.

Furthermore is there anyway I can mention that I'm doing a McKinsey leadership course very soon (18th July)? Since it is such a prestigious name, I'm sure it would count for something.


**Now as to my background**:
I'm a 17 year old, UK student that will be walking into banks throughout the next two weeks until I manage to secure an internship. My plan is to walk in, ask to speak to a financial advisor and hand them my CV and Cover letter and simply ask for an internship.

Other than critiquing my CV, do you think this is a good idea?

I'm doing this because I have no contacts and I've only been able to find one or two day courses at banks. I applied for two, got into McKinsey (although that's management consultancy, they seem to be spoken about in the same sentences as IB) and I failed to get into Merrill Lynch. However what I really want is an opportunity to immerse myself in the culture and environment and banking, and learn from bankers over the course of two or three weeks.

I'm willing to shine shoes, file papers and make coffee as long as I'm able to be in the same environment as bankers, see what they do and hopefully talk to them about their work. How can I convey this?

I doubt I'll be accepted, but I might as well give it a shot and try to get some experience over summer. My biggest worry is that the receptionist won't even let me speak to a financial advisor unless I have a reason.

I'm currently reading up on different positions in banks and their roles. My next step will be to write up a list of banks in my area (London), write a cover letter for each and hopefully start this plan by tomorrow, going to three or four banks a day until I get an internship. I'll go to boutique banks first, so that I can correct anything that goes wrong with my first four walk-ins and then start approaching bulge-bracket banks after I've done at least 5 boutique banks.

What do you think?

Since it'll be a year from now, does my goal of going to law school have any role to play in my resume? Or is it irrelevant?

For the time being, I'm looking for whatever job pays the most. But I am giving special considerations to jobs in the legal field. 

On that note, can I get some constructive critiques of my resume?

Please offer any comments or suggestions to help me land the interview. If you or someone you may know has alot of experience writing a technical resume and know you can vastly improve the look and feel of my resume please PM me as I am willing to PAY for a service if you can make my resume stand out and look far more professional than what it does right now.

I'd rather work at a great biotech company in sales if I can't get a lab job than be unemployed or work in an undesirable geographic area. **but I'm not sure what to put on my resume.** 

Here's my sales-related experience (very rough draft of phrasing):

**University student fundraiser**, Feb 2013 - present

* Raised current use dollars for University set priorities including financial aid, student programs, and research
* Responsible for building and improving relationships between the university and its constituents (alumni, parents, friends, etc.)
* Communicated university priorities, updates, and goals effectively to generous supporters
* Upheld donor confidentiality, reported alumni concerns to management and served as a university representative 

Met or exceeded fundraising goals in multiple areas
 
* Secured $4,245 pledge dollars during 4 months working (avg is $5,000 in 5 months)
* 43% of gifts on credit card (goal is 40%)
* $96 average gift (goal is $100, avg is $80)

**Girl Scout cookie salesperson**, 1996-2008 (probably only 2004-2008 is relevant)

* sold over 10,000 boxes of cookies during 12 years in scouts (contributing over $5,000 to my troop and council each)
* established and maintained customer relationships for 5-10 years
* personal sales techniques included contacting customers before sales began, meeting them in person to secure orders, and delivering cookies on a set timeline. 
* additionally, put in 6-18 hours a week at booth sales (in front of grocery stores), while on the JV swim team and maintaining honor roll in the International Baccalaureate program.  
* used money earned from cookie sales to gain new life experiences and network at Girl Scout camps around the country (dogsledding, scuba diving, Great Lakes kayak trip)


my issue is that Girl Scout cookies basically sell themselves, and my latest experience with that was over 5 years ago. It seems juvenile to put high school experience on a post college resume. but the numbers are impressive, and I did put in an extensive amount of time to get those kind of sales. I basically went to school for 7 hours, went across the street to the grocery store to sell for 3 hours (twice a week), went to swim practice for 2 hours, and went home at 7:30 to do homework. on weekends I did 3 or 6 hour shifts both Saturday and Sunday at various stores in my city.

I guess I will just start off with as to why I am asking for help / advice. I've not worked in 5 years and I am dealing with social anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, and some other things. I recently developed a desire to work towards getting a job at a gaming company as a player support specialist (someone who reviews cases, answers player questions, and things of that nature.) I know the company is very creative and they get a lot of applicants but I figure it's worth a shot if it's my dream job.

I'm not quite sure how I should approach my resume. Do I just make it plain and list things such as my previous job, education, and things that do go on a resume or should I be creative with it? Do I incorporate facts about myself or does that go on my cover letter? Do I say anything personal about myself? I feel like your resume and cover letter (from what I understand a CL is something that just goes a bit more in depth than what your resume does) describe you as a person but I feel it's hard for me to fully explain who I am with just a few words and bullet points. Am I approaching this the wrong way in terms of thinking? 

Needless to say I am super nervous and find myself having panic attacks when I think about how I am going to deal with all of this having minimal knowledge with how to even start working towards this job! It's the biggest step I have ever taken in my life but I know I can do the job if I did get it.

This is my standard rough cover letter for a potential photography job:


---  
Dear Personnel Manager:

Re: *** photographer position

I am writing to apply for the position of *** photographer at *** as was recently advertised on ***. 

I am a highly technical, organized, and motivated photographer with a passion for fashion and a good eye for composition and detail. I have 5 years of experience working as the in-house photographer and graphic designer for a non-profit, as well as 8 years of experience working as a freelance photographer for a number of clients.

I have experience photographing fashion, portraits, and still-life both in studio and on-location, for a range of clients and self-promotion. I have solid technical skills and an understanding of digital photographic equipment as well as lighting gear using a range of lighting techniques. I am confident in both the PC and Mac environments, as well as with my daily use of the Adobe Creative Suite, Lightroom, and Aperture.

Working as a graphic designer has helped me to develop my eye for good composition and gestalt in addition to an understanding of the requirements for photography used in an advertising layout. Being responsible for all photography of events, camps, and executive portraiture has developed my ability to work with a variety of shooting conditions, clients, and deadlines. 

I am known for an attention to detail, and am a voracious and efficient learner. I am also personable and outgoing, work well with different personality types, and deal with the unexpected with a calm and resourceful touch.
 
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the position with you further.

Yours sincerely,

Firstname Lastname

They should be somewhat personal, no? However, if I'm walking into these establishments looking to see if they are hiring, should I plan ahead with a letter for every manager of every establishment I intend on entering? I mean I can't just tell them I'll come back with a cover letter properly addressed to them when I find out they are indeed hiring, right? 

I just want to show them that, despite my ""all over the map"" history, I want to be there to not only work, but learn. I figure I can have one for restaurants and one for bakeries, but it won't be addressed as personal.

So simply what the title says, I've been working on my resume since May, readying up to start implementing it for the new year using the many helpful techniques, do's and don'ts, and advice given in this subreddit and r/jobs. 

I've already applied to ~10jobs with it in the last 2 weeks, culminating to 1 rejection and 9 no replies yet.

I've uploaded it for viewing: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwBB02R2Txz1Tk82Z3ZDdGRXckk/edit

I only put 2 jobs in the employment field that I believe have the most relevance and demonstrate my value/abilities. The jobs that I omitted include: 2 coffee-shop barista jobs, a waiter, and a window cleaning gig - all mostly done during high school. I'm still on the fence of keeping or not that security job. It has no relevance to my field but the resume feels empty without it on as I have no other thing to sub in.

I got a domain name registered. Wasn't able to find one with my lastname.com and so settled for it being my [firstname][lastname].com. My contact email is contact@firstlastname.com. Others that were considered: first@firstlastname.com, email@firstlastname.com, and me@firstlastname.com

I also had a hobbies section with 4 bullet points that I decided to remove. Still iffy about that, had some pretty good points that say much about my personal character. Some of them were: leading an improv team, trampoline dodgeball enthusiast, android tester.

I'm debating on trying this.  Basically, instead of trying to mix my achievements and responsibilities into a few bullet points and use every possible space to give more information, I would give less information.  

Each job would be the title, company, etc. Then 3-4 really short bullets of ""main responsibilities"".  And possibly one ""top achievement"".  

My thinking here is to simplify the resume while adding as many key words as possible.  This would make the resume pop up in more searches and have the benefit of being less to read for a potential employer.  

With this, I would make the cover letter much more personalized to the hiring manager and I would list my linked in profile on the resume.  On Linked in, I'd obviously have a lot more info for the person to read.  

I'm thinking this might get some response because it would really simplify things and keep the reader's attention.  I know in my line of work (corporate finance) we don't have time to read our own emails, much less resumes.  Mostly, we just want to see that the qualifications are met and will base the decision more on intangible things that we find out in the interview.

GPA will be around 3.1 or 3.2 overall, not sure whether to include it. Honestly don't know my major GPAs off the top of my head. Thoughts?

Should I list vague strengths like ""critical thinking skills"" and ""takes initiative?"" Or should I rely on recommendations/references for these things?

I have some other random things (I play drums, I know a small amount of Persian/Farsi, I have my own reliable car, etc) that might only under odd circumstances be relevant. But less is more, right? I have omitted them.

I started out at an expensive, out-of-state university and transferred to a smaller, more prestigious in-state one after three semesters. I omitted the first school from the resume, should I have included it?

I've had a few people tell me that I should take the bar experience off my resume as it is not related, and my resume should be career oriented.  I feel, however, that it shows that I have been able to hold a job since graduation and also that I have leadership, managerial, and excellent communication skills.  It also takes up a large portion of my resume, and I'm not even sure how I would compensate for that.  Anyone else have an opinion on that matter?

My concerns:

1)  My experience outside of retail management is slim, and the only retail/sales management job I will consider is in banking (I resigned due to nights/weekend scheduling, and will never look back).

2)  The ""Skills"" section is weak.

3)  My increase in branded merchandise sales number is based of handwritten charts, which I no longer have.  My old supervisor will not take the time to run through 2 years of sales to verify, so I can't count on him to back me up as a reference for that figure.  

Google Docs made the font and formatting look off, it looks much better in its original PDF form.  I'm more concerned with the content for now.
