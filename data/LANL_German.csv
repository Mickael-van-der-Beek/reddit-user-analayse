These are just some of the common ones I can think of. Feel free to add more and explain it if possible!

**echt, wirklich, doch, natürlich, auf jeden fall**

In my German class, we learned that *wirklich* can be used to show doubt, like ""really?"" But here I rarely hear anybody say wirklich, rather they say *echt?*. This might be a regional choice though, cause as far as I know they mean the same thing.

To affirm an answer we learned to say *ja* or *nein.* People here do say ja for yes, but instead of hearing nein I usually hear people say *nay* (dunno the spelling, there probably isn't, so read this like in English), as in ""nay danke."" Of course this isn't proper, but among my friends here and most places I goto (bakeries, stores, etc) people/I always say nay, but in my German class I say nein.

We also learned *natürlich* which means ""of course,"" kind of like another answer where you would say ja. Once I got here though I learned two more answers: *doch* and *auf jeden Fall*. They mean similar, but there are different situations you use them in. *Doch* is more like ""yes, why would you think otherwise?"" and *natürlich* is more like ""of course and you know it."" Like, if I asked you something like, ""You drink beer, don't you?"" with a hint of doubt, then you would answer ""doch!"" (of course, why would you even ask that?). If I asked, ""Would you mind answering the door while I'm in the shower?"" you would probably answer ""natürlich"" (sure, no problem). Auf jeden Fall is like ""absolutely!"", e.g., ""I've got some cold beer in the fridge, wanna come over and drink?"" ""auf jeden Fall!"" (sure! let's do it!).

**billig vs gunstig**

We learned the word *billig* in class for ""cheap"", but there's also another word I picked up here, *gunstig*. Billig is cheap with a more negative connotation, whereas gunstig is cheap as in price-wise.

das billige Auto = that cheap (piece of shit) car
das gunstige Auto = that nicely priced car

Every time you want to say billig, the word you're looking for is probably gunstig.

**scheiß**

One of the first days here I was talking to my roommate and said something like ""… scheißes Auto …"" and they laughed a bit, for declining scheiß because my German was ""so proper and strange."" Apparently scheiß can be used as an adjective that is never declined and always is simply *scheiß*, so ""*das scheiß Auto*"" is correct. Maybe technically it's not correct, but then again you would probably never use scheiß in any formal or educational setting.

I probably missed a lot but I have no go now. Please add your own!

edit 1: **Freund/Freundin**

I don't remember *ever* learning in my German classes in the US that these words are actually used to mean boyfriend/girlfriend, but they are.

sie ist *meine* Freundin = she is my girlfriend

sie ist *eine* Freundin = she is a/my (girl) friend

I guess this could lead to some funny situations but if you mess up it's not a big deal, Germans aren't going to think you're gay or lesbian.

edit 2: **gleichfalls**

Gleichfalls means ""same to you,"" i.e.: ""have a good day"" -&gt; ""thanks and you too."" I use this one a lot, especially when I'm in a situation where someone wishes me a nice day, and I'm not sure if we're speaking with *du* or with *Sie*. Just smile and say ""danke, gleichfalls"" and everything is fine (rather than *dir/Ihnen auch*).

On a related note, how to wish people a good day? *Schönen Tag noch/schönen Abend/schönes Wochenende* all work depending on the situation of course.

**ich bin dabei**

""Hey, wir gehen ins Kinos, kommst du mit?""
""Ja cool, ich bin dabei.""

**alles klar?**

I learned *wie geht's* like probably everybody else, but over here people also/mostly say, ""*alles klar?*"" when they run into people they know. It's mostly a greeting like ""hey dude"" and doesn't warrant an explanation of how things are going so my response would usually just be to say 'alles klar' in an affirmative tone and shake hands or something.

**stimmt so**

When people tip here they usually just round the change up, i.e., 4.80€ -&gt; 5€ or something like that. So a useful phrase is *stimmt so* when paying for food. In this situation you would give them the 5€ bill and say ""stimmt so"" and it basically means to keep the change.

**hä?**

huh --&gt; hä

1366471728.0,61,self.LANL_German,1cqt7r,"I'm uploading 8,000 words to Memrise; especially pertinent for anyone wanting to read Harry Potter in German",TMoneytron,72,11,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/1cqt7r/im_uploading_8000_words_to_memrise_especially/,"http://www.memrise.com/course/87685/vocab-from-books/

This a course I'm uploading.  These are words I've pulled directly from novels and occasionally newspaper articles.  The most useful thing about this though, is that about the first 4,000 words or so are pulled directly from Harry Potter.  And the course corresponds with the series.  So if you were to work your way through this while reading the books, it would go a long way for your reading comprehension.

The words come with sentences, unfortunately a lot of them are cut off or just two or three words since I pulled them out of PDFs and the software I was using cut off the sentences at line breaks (which happen in PDFs versus Epub or Ebooks).

I thought you guys could make use of this.  I'll keep uploading words!  

EDIT: Also, at the beginning there's a lot more past tense words.  I get better about it later as I started trying to just find the infinitive of each word.  I also stopped adding declensed words, so don't get too annoyed with the first few couple hundred words or so.  

EDIT2: I've been working my way through the annoying word endings / changing some words into infinitive.  So bear with me!

Also, for anyone who wants to put this into Anki, here you go:

There's a cool Google Text-to-speech extension which allows you to mass generate audio for the words.  Making it easier to learn in my opinion.

I really wanted to post this since I just got back from a month and a half travelling around Europe.  I spent almost 4 weeks in German speaking countries, met several German speakers in hostels, etc.  

And, some people on here, and Reddit in general, seem to think that you won't get to use your German if you move to Germany.  That is just crazy.  The only way this is true is if you don't try.

Not only did I use my German, but I went from stumbling awkward to conversational in like a week.  Getting it out is half the battle.  While this may be true for me it may not be true for you (since I was mostly reading books in German before I came, not practicing conversation).

My experiences: Nightmarish customer service from T-Mobile, and basically having to wait a half an hour the one time I asked for someone who spoke English.  Guess what: hardly anyone does in customer service.  I even got into a heated argument in German, where I got to practice my cuss words! 

In Würzburg I was invited out on a bachelorette / hen party because I started talking to all the drunk girls running around my hostel.  I spent the entire night at dinner talking German with them.  Then the bride starting puking in the bathroom.  Their English wasn't anywhere as good as my German, and once they found that out, they basically switched over to German from their broken English to save themselves the effort.  This is a theme.

In my hostel in Berlin, I had two Austrian girls in my room.  They hardly spoke ANY English.  And these aren't older people, they were people my age.  

The same was true everywhere in Eastern Germany.  In Leipzig, I had two German roommates that didn't hardly speak any English.  We had very nice conversations in German.  And they all wanted to know where I learned my German from: Harry Potter auf Deutsch!  

It's also not just true for East Germany, but I met and hung out with a bunch of college students from Munich at Oktoberfest.  I kept up with the slang and we were all joking and having a great time *in German*.  To be honest, the number of Germans that I spoke German with in Germany (that's a lot of G's), greatly outnumbered the people I spoke English with.  And guess what?  They really appreciate it if you speak German, I met a ton of great fun, people.  The Germans really do know a thing or two about the Gemütlichkeit.  

Moreover, almost all the TV is in German.  Even popular American TV shows are dubbed in German most of the time.  

And, as a nice aside, If you travel in Eastern Europe, German is the second most common second language after English.  I had hostelmates from Slovakia and Hungary and they couldn't speak a lick of English, but were pretty good at German.  We also met the owner of our hotel in Bulgaria, her English was terrible, but her German was great.  People are learning German!

So be bold, be relieved, and be happy.  I promise you, you are not learning your German for nothing, and if you ever make it to Germany, you will use it if you try.

&gt;Ä = AE

&gt;Ö = OE

&gt;Ü = UE

Not sure if it's easy to remember, but it's simple and better than just using the letters they base on. Sometimes people pronounce it like the letter, that's wrong and most times they're the people who may not even know the three german letters ÄÖÜ and how they're pronounced.

A few examples:
&gt;Anfänger, Wörter, Übungen, Üben, mähen, Bär, Käse.

Sorry if it's badly explained but I'd rather see someone write Anfaenger than Anfanger. I know Anfanger wouldn't be completely wrong, but it's much better if you write it with ae. Especially for someone who learns german and does not know the word. For example if I'd teach someone with writing and I write ""Bar"" instead of ""Bär"", and he uses that someday to ask someone ""Gibt es hier Baren?"" and he pronounces it like it's written, they would probably think of a [Barren](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Lingot_aluminium.jpg/800px-Lingot_aluminium.jpg) or if he says ""Bar"" of a [Bar](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_\(Lokal\)).

For instance, this subreddit seems to dislike Rosetta Stone but love Duolingo. While Duolingo is an improvement over Rosetta Stone, I've seen most of the people who've successfully self taught themselves suggest against learning this way. Regardless, I see it being upvoted to the top of every thread it's mentioned in. Don't get me wrong, I like duolingo for some vocab practice, but it's not as useful as people make it out to be.

""Leb doch mehr wie deine Mutter""
Live more like your mother (does).

""Das ist doch ein guter Artikel""
That is a good article

In each of these sentences (just random ones I scribbled down today while on the lookout for doch) I throw away the doch and infer meaning from the rest of the sentence. For all I know, the doch could be changing the whole meaning of the sentence.

I've done my research and STILL don't understand doch. I know how to use it as a response to a question, i.e. ""on the contrary"" and occasionally I understand when it is used as an adverb. Dict.cc tells me that as an adverb it can mean ""however, yet, still, nevertheless, after all"". None of these seem to make sense, though, when it comes to deconstructing examples of doch that I come across every day.

When we started this subreddit, it was part of a collaborative effort between multiple languages to make it easier to learn a foreign tongue. This community didn't exist when I was a beginner, and I'm glad it didn't.

We all got to where we are by putting in some hard work memorizing verb forms, endings tables for the accusative, dative, and genitive cases, and the gender of each and every noun we wrote down. It took a while to understand some things like separable prefix verbs, prepositional phrases, and Konjunktiv II.

As a contributor of this subreddit, I want to remind every one of you that you will not be helping students by simply handing them answers to questions that are far beyond their reach. Language is learned in little steps, and it doesn't help students to have the first step given to them without their understanding of the subject matter.

Students: I encourage you to try and push your understanding of the German language to the next level. Try and use a pronoun or preposition you don't quite understand. Try to turn a verb into a noun. Take a guess as to the ending of the adjective, and if you have a specific question, [like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/n8pxk/studying_for_my_german_102_final_and_need_some/), we'll be there to help. But please don't ask us to do your work for you. It hurts your academic performance, and you really won't learn anything.

Alles Gute zum Abschluss des Semesters,

You all know that to get good at writing in a language, you have to do it, and do it lots. You also know that boring writing tasks don't let you learn anything. And finally, if you don't get corrections afterward, you'll just fossilise your errors and not learn anything either.

So let's do some writing together!

Rules:

* Word limit per entry: 200
* Maximum entries per person: unlimited
* Form: free choice. Poetry, prose, whatever

Corrections welcome in sub-comments. 
Voting via... voting. 
No prizes, but certainly a winner.

Even if your German is not great, you could still write something that people will enjoy, and then with corrections you'll end up with a nice piece of your own writing.

* I was wondering whether [+request] - this is a crucial phrase in English email writing because it is a way to make a request of the other person, even if the request is large or the other person is in a position of power. For example, [To a professor] ""I was wondering if you could clarify something in the course outline...""

* Hi [+ First name] - this one is a bit dubious because it may even be culturally dependant. Here in Australia you can begin an email  to someone you have never met in this way (even a professor) because email is considered less formal than a letter. ""Dear..."" sounds a little stitled. Is email viewed similarly in Germany?

* Any other greeting formulas/salutations. I've found a couple of lists on the internet but they just list possibilities, without commenting on who should/could use them. If you list them, can you say when a student at uni would use it if addressing someone higher up?

I have created an app for Android phones as a hobby and I thought some people on this forum might be interested in it. It is a completely free hobby project of mine and I would love some people to see if they can get some use out of it.

The app collects news from German (and English) news sites. You can then read the news in German (or English) and if you don't know a word you tap on it to obtain a translation (in German or English). You can also read Wikipedia and Wiktionary articles on that word for more information.

I made it while living in Germany as an ex-pat and I wanted to read the news that the Germans were reading.

It uses the FreeDict dictionaries for translating, so it doesn't have the biggest database to pull from (going to look at implementing the dict.cc wordlist in the future) but the German/English ones are pretty good.

I hope some people use it and it helps them improve their German! Could definitely be used by Germans looking to improve their English as well:)

Here it is! I'm so happy!! 

I'll share my story with you, just because I feel like I should:

My name is Anna and I am 21 years old.  I am studying to be a CPA, and have been doing so for about 4 years (and I have to be in school for 2 more years because I need to have a master's degree before I can even get the license to be a CPA).

That's the basic information about me :). ANYWAY; I always wanted to learn the German language, however my high school was so small that I never had the opportunity to take it. That was until I got to college.  I was signing up for classes and found that I needed to take one more class to fill my schedule.  Just for fun, I saw that Intro to German was available and signed up immediately. I took the class and loved it! I loved it so much that I continued to practice the language outside of the house.  (I even trained my dogs and bird to understand German commands :P)  I continued to take the class up until the 212 (which is intermediate). 

Unfortunately, this is the semester that I had to stop.  I work at my dad's office (he's a CPA and I have plans to take over the business when I have my CPA license) and the Spring semester falls right in the middle of Tax Season, where I tend to work an average of 50-60 hours per week.  This means that I have to make sacrifices in the classes I take... Meaning online-only classes to get through the semester. 

I was so happy to find this subreddit because that means that I can continue to learn and perfect my German! I love this language and I look forward to anything this subreddit has to offer. 

TL;DR I love this subreddit. :)",,False,,t5_2rd5y,False,,,True,t3_p8ijm,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/p8ijm/just_found_this_subreddit_and_its_amazing/,

Throughout the game, I am addressed as 'ihr', even though I am only one person. In fact, I don't think I have ever been addressed as du/Sie.

For example, a character attacking me yells 'Ihr [see above] gehört mir' (from 'You're mine' in English?). Can you do that in German, or has the translator simply been handed the string 'You're mine' and told to translate it without context? Or the coach-owner that takes you between cities tells me to hineinklettern whereas einsteigen seems more natural (I suppose it is an ambiguous case because the animation has you climbing into the back using both hands and feet but einsteigen seems more natural when enetering a mode of transport).

Perhaps people here aren't aware of this type of grammar guide, but I have found it as a wonderful resource for Japanese, but have yet to find a similar guide for German.

If one doesn't exist, I have considered writing one up myself (I have about 2 weeks of break left, so I would have some time to start).  I would have no problem writing up sections for up to intermediate level grammar or maaaybe lower level advanced, but I am not sure where these cut offs are or what is considered ""advanced"".  But if you have a look at the guide, I would want to split up the grammar into these kinds of sections:

""Beginner's Grammar""

""Essential Grammar""

""Special Expressions""

""Advanced Topics""

As well as some other sections for spelling / pronunciation, with links to videos, blah blah.


I was also considering finding lots of example sentences from German writing (Probably German Translations of Harry Potter / The Hobbit)

Thoughts?

**EDIT** Well because there seems to be some interest, I will begin work on it soon and give an update when I get a few sections / layout done to a good degree.

One of them (this one specifically: http://www.amazon.com/German-Speak-Write-Beginners-Guides/dp/9650060359/ref=pd_sim_b_1) tells me that when using the pronoun ""it"" in German, you should always use the gender of the noun that is being replaced by the pronoun. For example: ""Die Milch ist weiß; sie ist weiß"" using the feminine ""sie"" because the noun ""die milch"" is feminine. Is this correct? Do native Germans speak like this? None of my other German books have this and I've even tried Googling it but haven't come up with anything; everything else I have seen seems to indicate that one should just use the neuter ""es"" whenever needing the pronoun ""is"", such as ""Der Tisch ist braun; es ist Braun.""

The problem is I won't be encountering many people during my next visit to Germany who speak like newscasters.  Watching either German television shows/movies or English shows/movies dubbed into German is pretty challenging.  I can make out large chunks of speech, but a lot of it sounds slurred and blurred.  A more extreme example are documentaries that I watch about drug addicts or gang members in Germany, who are almost incomprehensible to me when interviewed.  However, even people in the higher rungs of society still slur their speech, chop off the endings or beginnings of words, etc.  I've seen interviews of rich people who are pretty hard to understand too.  

Anyway, I watch a ton of both German documentaries, news clips and and American TV series dubbed into German.  (I don't generally watch many movies in any language.)  I spend at least 2-3 hours a day doing it, but feel like I'm hitting a wall in terms of listening comprehension. For example, I watched all five seasons of The Wire dubbed into German, which I've previously seen twice through in English, and while I can understand much of the dialogue, there are large gaps where I recognize a bunch of words that I know but can't make out a coherent message.  I feel like I'd be completely lost if it weren't for the fact that I already know the plot.  Admittedly, ""The Wire"" auf Deutsch is harder to understand than the dubbed versions of, say, ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Spartacus"", because the script writers of the German version of ""The Wire"" employed a ""street Deutsch"" for the Barksdale and Stanfield crews (yes, even interspersed with ""nigga"" and ""yo""), but even the cops are a bit challenging to understand.  

Will I understand it all with time if I stick with it, or would you recommend a specific strategy?  I figured that I can't be the only one who has or has had this problem.  I've toyed around with watching a short clip repeatedly, but that gets boring fast, and I generally max out on the amount I can understand if the speech is too slurred.",,False,,t5_2rd5y,False,,,True,t3_19ye67,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/19ye67/the_challenge_of_understanding_nonnewscaster/,

*Vor- hover the free hand in front of the fist so that your fist is separating your body and your free hand.

I study A LOT and see a tutor once a week (native German) to help me with things as I progress. 
My goal is to eventually get to a point where I can speak the language well enough to confidently hold conversations with Germans, etc. I really like learning it and my husband is learning too - we want to eventually speak German solely in our household and use English at work, etc in order to use both daily. 

My issue is that I keep hearing from family members and friends that it's a waste of time and that adults cannot learn a second language. I've had a few claim it was impossible and I've read online that it does seem that adults aren't able to ever become 'fluent'. While I am as green as grass with the language and know I need to put in a lot of time and sweat equity into my studies to get anywhere, I do want to achieve my eventual goals of being close to fluent. Can anyone comment on their experiences with picking up the language as a second one and having limitations (like not living in a German speaking country, etc) and how it's working for them? Is it true that it's not possible to learn it as an adult?

I was off to a good start, but got stuck for awhile after trying to host it on a wiki page.  I wanted a wiki looking format without the editability of other authors, so currently I haven't posted any material.  However, now that my schedule is slowly becoming more free, and will be MUCH more free this summer, I can devote a lot more time to this project.

I have some notes written up on about 10 topics, but I need to collect them a little differently.  I would like some help coming up with other topic ideas though.  Here is the current list in the order I am so far planning on presenting them.

There is some overlap between topics, but I would be presenting different material (such as modal verbs will only cover certain modals and the general frame work) in order to separate topics by meaning.  Simply because some grammar looks similar doesn't mean I want to combine them.

What am I missing and how should I change the order?

*Wunderbar. Können wir jetzt anfangen?*

English is one of the stranger languages to ever exist. A third of its words have come from Latin, another third from French and then there's a whole bunch of others...

*Wichtig - Weighty - Important.*

Wichtige Wörter are important. It comes down to being able to build sentences and have conversations with the most popular words out there. These include the equivalents of 'you' and 'I', 'du' und 'ich'. However, English has this problem of being a very isolating language. The words don't change much. In every other European language, the ending will change in some form or another. I suggest you don't worry about that, and don't let that scare you off.

*Du - Thou - You.*

Du must know which words are wichtig. Ich mean that we should be able to bend the English language every now and then and start to learn German by just guessing. Don't be afraid to type a random sentence in the comment box at this point, it will look wonderfully Gothic. Naturally, that doesn't mean that you can't use many of the words that don't sound German in German. Even French words can be quite komfortabel or akzeptabel in German.

*Dein - Thine - Your.*

Look at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou#Comparison) Tabelle. Du siehst that there's many similarities between Ye Olde English and German. However, that's quite misleading. There's many words that will  nevertheless befuddle and confuse you.

...

*Das ist gut - That is good.*

All in all, what ist the most be-angst-ing for students of Deutsch? It's long words. Words like Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän. This, however, would be even longer in English. In order, it's Danube-steam-ship-drive-society-ship-captain. In a nutshell, the only words you don't know are Fahrt, which survives in the English word 'fare' with the meaning 'going' or 'travelling'. Gesell, which means companion and dampf, which survives, with other meanings usurped, as 'damp'.

In a nutshell, this complicated longest word in the German language only has one single part that you aren't using already in some fashion in everyday speech. On the contrary, sometimes German is even more concise. My English teacher in Austria went on a ski trip. As she went downhill her students wished her a 'Good fahrt', not knowing what a downhill run would be called in English and to keep it as short as possible.

The best thing you can also do is to immerse yourself. I received a C in English back when I lived in Austria. By the time I finished my first term in Australia, I was on a B+.

Homework: Build an English sentence with any of these words:

*You, I, have, am, an, aardvark*

I am a university student in my 4th year studying German (seven years of language instruction all together) and I have just been appointed for a paid job tutoring a professor in another college at the university who has had no previous German language experience.

My first question is how I can go about putting together a lesson plan at a pace which will benefit in in the three months I have to instruct her.  I don't have much in the line of beginning text book since I tested out of beginning classes coming in to college so I'm also not sure where to go on that.  I don't have the money to buy additional books, so if anyone knows any easily accessible online materials that would be awesome.

Also, we are meeting on Friday to negotiate pay.  I had initially thought this would be a job tutoring a fellow student, in which case I would keep the cost at a low $15-20 per hour.  given that this is a professor and the director of one of the institutes on campus I feel I have a lot more to work with as far as wage negotiations, especially given I will probably turn down other job offers I receive for supplemental income in lieu of this.

Finally, tying both topics together, how many sessions/hours per week would be most beneficial for such lessons?  The student is a very busy middle aged professor.

Heute haben wir in meiner Forschunggruppe übergeredet, wie mann einer Post-doc bekommt.  Es war bemerkt, dass in Amerika es nicht gefragt würde, ob mann geheiratet sie, oder ob her kinder hätte, aber in Deutschland solche Fragen wären typisch.

Und dann dachte ich - es ist kein Problem, dass meine Mitarbeiter wissen, dass ich schwull bin, aber ich finde es ist etwas ganz unangebracht ins Einstellungsgespräch überzureden.  Auf Englisch, gibt es viele Arte, ein Freund/Partner/Ehemann usw überzureden, ohne dass es klar ist, das es ein Man ist. Ich könnte sagen, ""my spouse"", oder wenn es nicht so formal wäre, ""yeah, I'm seeing someone since recently, they're really cool!"", mit ""they"" und ""them"", obwol es nur eine Person ist.

Doch auf Deutsch scheint es einfach unmöglich zu sein!  Wenn jemandemn sich sein Homosexualität noch nicht zum ganzen Welt bekennen will, muss er einfach lügen, weil geschlechtsneutralle Wörter wie ""spouse"" und ""partner"" werden ""Ehemann/Ehefrau"" und ""Partner/Partnerin"". Und der Plural benutzen klingt auch nicht richtig.

Wie klappt es denn? Und hab ich recht oder nicht, dass es ein unangebracht Inhalt eines Einstellungsgesprächs wäre?

English paraphrase:

Today in my research group we were discussing the topic of finding a post-doc after completing your Ph.D.  It was mentioned that it would be inappropriate to ask if the applicant is married or has kids in the US, but that such questions are common in Germany.

And then I thought - sure, my coworkers know I'm gay and that's fine, but that's an awfully awkward subject to bring up in a job interview.  How would I skirt that? In English, there are lots of ways to discuss your partner without making it obvious that the partner is a man, for example ""spouse"", ""partner"", or, in less formal conversations, using ""they"" and ""them"": ""Yeah, I just started seeing the coolest person, they're great! I'm looking forward to seeing them again!"".

But in German it seems to simply be impossible! Words like ""spouse"" and ""partner"" have a gender-specific ending, and misusing the plural to apply to one person seems wrong.  Do closeted germans simply have to lie and use the wrong pronouns?

Also, am I right in my assumption that sexual orientation would be an awkward topic to discuss in a job interview?

That's pretty simple and completely understandable.

But, when I hear people speak (here in Germany), sometimes I hear constructions like:

&gt; Meine Freundin heißt Sara. Die ist zu Hause.

This is where the problems start for me. It's already established that the person speaking is talking about his girlfriend Sara, so why not say,

&gt; Meine Freundin heißt Sara. Sie ist zu Hause.

Maybe this sentence doesn't work but I don't know how this works so I'm just making something up. I think native Germans would know what I'm talking about though.

Is it somehow related to the sentence constructions like,

&gt; Meine Freundin, die zu Hause ist, heißt Sara.

I am a Master's student in theology. Eventually, I would like to pursue a PhD. Nearly all programs require having a proficient reading knowledge of German. I would really like to have this before I apply to help my chances of being accepted. 

I received permission to sit in on an undergraduate German class this next semester (not taking it for credit, or even officially auditing, just showing up), but I just found out that it is a second year German class. So, this will be the student's fourth semester learning German, whereas I haven't taken any courses. I have worked on German some on my own (Rosetta Stone), but I am certainly not on par with a fourth semester student. The professor emailed me and let me know where the students were at in their learning. 

From the email: Grammatically, they can speak, read and write in present and conversational past tense (what we call in English present perfect tense).  They have been introduced to all four cases, and have knowledge of most prepositions that use all four cases.  Vocabulary is fairly rudimentary -- focusing on home, school, family, food, directions, clothing, etc.  We'll spend some time this semester cultivating vocabulary for the various majors represented in the class: photography, history, theater, and we can easily add theology.
We use the ninth edition of the text ""Deutsch heute"" by Moeller, Adolph, Hoecherl-Alden and Berger. (Heinle is the publisher).  Students also by for $7.50 a book of poems, songs, games.  

So, my question for you all is what do you recommend for catching up with the class quickly? Are there any resources that would be more useful than others? I have studied other languages in the past (Ancient Greek and Hebrew), but have yet to study a living language. Any advice on what to focus on, or how to progress would be most welcome. Thank you.

I know there are German language subreddits, but most people on those subreddits are very fluent in German, so it might be out of place for us beginners to post there. It would be great to have a safe space to practice where there were other beginners.

It has the 4000 most common words in German with example sentences. It is easily obtained in PDF form via Google. I want to copy the content into excel spreadsheets for uploading onto vocab websites/memrise/anki/whatever.

Currently, here is what I'm thinking for workflow. The book doesn't translate very well if you just copy paste (for example, example sentences that are two lines copy as two lines instead of one, and need to be put into one line for the spreadsheet). They also don't have proper umlauts and things of that nature. But, I have a hard copy of the book, so I can go through and correct and proof read the copied spreadsheets and make sure they are accurate. If I can get a few people to help me copy the chapters into spreadsheets, I can correct them and reupload them for all to use. There are 24 chapters in the book, each with a few sections. If I can get maybe 10 people to help me get them into the spreadsheet form, we can have this done within maybe two weeks.

After we have the 4000 words/sentences set up, there is another book that has the top 15,000 words, including all of the ZD words, that we can also work on. It's called [Grosser Lernwortschatz Deutsch Als Fremdsprache](http://www.amazon.com/Grosser-Lernwortschatz-Deutsch-Als-Fremdsprache/dp/3190074720/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374950716&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=grosser+lernwortschatz). This book does not have example sentences for every word (it does have some sentences/phrases), so it should be easier in a sense, but it does have a lot more words obviously. Again, I can use my hard copy to correct the errors from copying from the PDF. Obviously this one would be a bit more ambitious, so I would say lets wait until we have the other one finished before tackling this one.

If you'd like to see an example of the work I've done so far, [here is an example](https://mega.co.nz/#!A0A1lBwL!Hn9YV2opjxeoZkgUY-r671ecsoBPsZzE991Y3Ty8lMY
). This is from the chapter on business. The Basic German Vocabulary book breaks the words up into the first 2000 and the next 2000 for each category (for example in the 2000 most common words, those relating to business are put into the business chapter; the words from 2000-4000 are also in this chapter, but in their own section; the book recommends learning the first 2000 first). If you look at the bottom of the spreadsheet, there are two tabs. One for the words that fall into the first 2000 words, and one for the business words that fall into the 2000-4000 group. I'd like to copy this format for all the chapters in the book and upload them.

If anyone would like to help me with this, PM me or post here. Once I get a sense of how many people want to help (if anyone wants to help?) I can start breaking down chapter assignments (maybe we can do a shared dropbox folder or something) and we can get to copying.

A few weeks back I posted here regarding my news reader app for Android, Newsfluss. The idea is to read the news and if you don't know a word you can just tap it for a quick translation.

A number of people mentioned the fact that the dictionary provided by Freedict was a bit too small and slow. So I have updated the app to implement the word list provided by dict.cc! This gives users the huge database provided by dict.cc for offline use.

I would be really interested in what people think of the implementation.

My question is whether I should try to learn the pronounciation now, later or just try to improve it as I go? I don't want to learn it incorrectly and have to fight habits to fix in the future, but I can't seem to grasp things like the guttural R; the way I say it seems to just sound wrong.

I started taking a German 1A course at my school in January. I also have been taking the introductory course on memrise (which has helped tremendously). I try to learn 15-20 words a day. I've been learning a fair amount of grammar in class, but that is ending and the teaching was somewhat limited. I also have Rosetta Stone, although I don't use it very often. Well, today I found out that I will be moving to Germany in 3 months. What do you think is the best suggested regiment for me to maximize my German speaking abilities by arrival? What tools are available that will help me succeed at a quick pace? School is ending this week, so besides work and me scrambling to move continents, I will be dedicating much of my free time to the German language.

* What does Standard German actually sound like to native Germans? Does it give an impression of high education (like a Harvard or Oxford accent), indicate you're from the middle of Germany, or does it hint that it's not your first language? In case of the latter, should I select a regional dialect to pronounce? (My godfather speaks fluent Low German, if that helps.)

* Assuming no negative repercussions (like being made fun of or being misunderstood professionally), would it be a good or bad idea to take on a German accent and pronunciation rules even when speaking English? For example, deliberately pronouncing W like V, or A always as in 'draw' or 'father'.

I was thinking, if I was saying 'Achtung, Nein!' to someone, what would be the circumstance?  Would they have done something to me?  Would I be warning them?  Refusing them?  I chose to translate it as 'Attention, no!' and Duolingo duly marked me correct.  I guess I am, without context.  However I am sitting here thinking I have never said 'Attention, no!' and likely never will.  I don't think I've heard people say 'Attention!' outside of films that portray the military.

So amongst those who have a good feel for the language and where it is spoken, when would you say 'Achtung', really, in normal life today?

Part of what makes learning another language great is not just that you are learning about language in general - wide applicability! but you are also led to consider your native language.  A pedestrian, specific hypothetical is perhaps people just don't often say 'Attention!' 'Caution!' to each other that much anyway and the situation with 'Achtung' is the same.

Lieber guter Weihnachtsmann,

jetzt ist's soweit, jetzt bist du dran.
Mein Chef ist nämlich Rechtsanwalt.
Der klagt dich an, der stellt dich kalt.

Schon seit vielen hundert Jahren
bist du nun durch's Land gefahren,
ohne Nummernschild und Licht,
auch TÜV und ASU gab es nicht.

Dein Schlitten eignet sich nur schwer
zur Teilnahme am Luftverkehr.
Es wird vor Gericht zu klären sein:
Besitzt du 'nen Pilotenschein?

Durch den Kamin ins Haus zu kommen,
ist rein rechtlich strenggenommen
Hausfriedensbruch - Einbruch sogar,
das gibt Gefängnis, das ist klar.

Und stiehlst du nicht bei den Besuchen
von fremden Tellern Obst und Kuchen?
Das wird bestraft, das muss man ahnden,
die Polizei lässt nach dir fahnden.

Es ist auch allgemein bekannt,
du kommst gar nicht aus diesem Land.
Wie man so hört, steht wohl dein Haus
am Nordpol, also sieht es aus,
als kommst du nicht aus der EU,
das kommt zur Klageschrift dazu!

Hier kommt das Arbeitsrecht zum Tragen,
ein jeder Richter wird sich fragen,
ob deine Arbeit rechtens ist,
weil du ohne Erlaubnis bist.

Der Engel, der dich stets begleitet,
ist minderjährig und bereitet
uns daher wirklich Kopfzerbrechen,
das Jugendamt will mit dir sprechen!

Jetzt kommen wir zu ernsten Sachen,
wir finden es gar nicht zum Lachen,
dass Kindern du mit Schläge drohst,
darüber ist mein Chef erbost.

Nötigung heisst das Vergehen
und wird bestraft, das wirst du sehen,
mit Freiheitsentzug von ein paar Jahren,
aus ist's bald mit dem Schlitten fahren.

Das Handwerk ist dir bald gelegt,
es sei denn dieser Brief bewegt
dich, die Kanzlei reich zu beschenken,
dann wird mein Chef es überdenken!",,False,,t5_2rd5y,False,,,True,t3_157z9z,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/157z9z/funny_christmas_poem_exercise_for_advanced/,

It's called [Learning With Texts](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/).  This wonderful open source tool allows you to edit text, combine it with audio, have instant translation, vocabulary and database building all in one.

The installation is a bit counterintuitive, but the app itself is light and quick.  I simply loaded up some text from a book I had, paired it with audio and it allows you to even save terms and phrases to review later.  Terms that you marked to learn later show up highlighted in red, and terms that you do not know (as you slowly will build up a database of terms you DO know) show up highlighted in blue.  

I think you can even ""sentence mine"", which is just matching audio with a sentence or phrase read by a narrator.  I have yet to figure that out, however.  

This is a very effective tool to enhance understanding.  Definitions simply pop up to the side.  You can even chose what dictionary to use.  Unfortunately Google Translate disabled their API so you cannot one click translate sentences / phrases from them anymore (because the program splits up your text automatically based on sentences and phrases), but Linguee.de still works.  

Give it a try!  It even works on your iPad.  This would be the only thing I think I would want one for.  For anyone who is curious you can get free texts off of:

I've run across this type of usage of ""mögen"" several times and I am utterly confused. In my Langenscheidt dictionary are two words:

1) mögen (mag, mochte, **hat mögen**) - verwendet, um auszudrücken, dass etwas möglich ist

2) mögen (mag, mochte, **hat gemocht**) - etwas gut finden

Also thrown into this mix is our good friend ""möchten"".

My question is two parts. First, are ALL of these words really various manifestations of the same word, with differences coming from Konjunktiv use? 

And second, in the case of ""Wer mögen die Toten gewesen sein?"" would you translate ""mögen"" as ""could""? And could ""mögen"" in this case be replaced with, say, ""könnten""?

For example: ""What do you want to do?"" ""We could go to the movie or something'"". 

It makes the reply I made (about the movie) a little bit vague - Movie or not - it doesn't matter that much. 

Does the phrase 'oder etwas' or 'oder was' translate correctly? I've also seen the phrase 'oder vergleichen' in a Kinderbuch I'm reading, but I'm not sure how to translate that.

1355090938.0,13,self.LANL_German,14kg5f,German WWII reenactor looking for help with military phrases,SeldomSeven,18,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/14kg5f/german_wwii_reenactor_looking_for_help_with/,"Guten Tag meine Damen und Herren! 

I'm a member of a living-history/reenacting group that portrays German soldiers from WWII. Obviously there are a lot of mixed feelings about that sort of thing out there, so I want to make it clear up front that **we do not in any way support the Nazi ideology**. My unit makes it a point never to use the Hitler Salute or utter the phrase ""Heil Hitler"" in any context. Personally, I partake in this hobby in an effort to educate people about that period of history and emphasize that the average German soldier of WWII was not some deranged psychopath, but rather a fairly normal human being with similar values to any solider. I believe recognizing that it doesn't take a monster to do monstrous things is a very important lesson to remember if we want to prevent something like the atrocities of WWII from ever happening again. 

But that aside, let's get to the reason I'm here. I've studied German as a non-native speaker for about two years now, but my education on military terminology and informal phrases has been pretty sparse since such things are obviously not emphasized in classes. Below I've listed a few phrases that would often come up in my reenactments for which I'd like to know good German translations. I have come up with some translations on my own, but I want to see what other people come up with to see whether I'm on the right track. Again, imagine that you're a solider when translating these; a stressed-out solider wouldn't say ""I am reloading my rifle!"" in combat, but rather something like ""Reloading!!"" I'm just not sure how a native German speaker would abbreviate such expressions. Anyways, here are the phrases:

(I am) Reloading!

Get in position! 

Stay in position! 

Stay in a firing line! (Schützenkette is the word I've found for firing line)

Don't move or I'll shoot! 

Advance 300 meters!

Advance behind the tank 300 meters! 

Advance to the treeline! 

Retreat! 

Don't give up! / Never surrender!  

We surrender! 

Range: 500 meters (artillery command)

Fire for effect! (artillery command)

Soup's on! (or some other idiom for: ""It's time to eat"")

Keep an eye on that ridge-line! (ridge-line / berm / small hill / knoll)

Look over there!    *

Keep your head down! 

Take cover!

(other phrases such as jeers towards the enemy, encouragement to Kameraden, and so on)

    *I am aware that ""schau mal da drüben!"" would probably work. 
    But this brings up a question of mine: 
    What's the difference between ""Schauen"" and ""Sehen""? 
    Could you also say ""sieh da!"" and does it have the same meaning?

I'm wondering how people here approach the task of reading, especially when it comes to words that they don't know.  Even without looking up every word, do you find that your vocabulary improves considerably by the time you're done with a book due to reading so many new words within the context of words that you already know?

And put categories with them!  What hältet ihr davon?  I'll start with at least one that has helped me:

**Vocabulary:**

[Langenscheidt's Grundwortschatz](http://www.amazon.com/Basic-German-Vocabulary-Langenscheidt-Bock/dp/3468494009/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1): A nice some 4,000 word system of the most common words in German.  This will go a long way to improving general comprehension.  You can also get the Vokabeltrainer software that comes with the words and audio.

**General Comprehension:**

[Using German](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521530008/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_g14_i4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-3&amp;pf_rd_r=138GD64XCT5A8YX11M5C&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938811&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) by Martin Durrell.  I've heard good things about this but don't own it.  What do other people think?

[1001 Pitfalls in German](http://www.amazon.com/1001-Pitfalls-German-Henry-Strutz/dp/0812096525).
It covers quite a bit of grammar aspects and better clarifications that I havent seen elsewhere without supersupertechnical jargon (I mean it's still technical but not say as heavy as Hammers). It's a little old but it's still darn good.

**Grammar:**

[Harrap's Pocket German Grammar](http://www.amazon.com/Harraps-Pocket-German-Grammar-language/dp/0071636234): It's a small book with a lot of information and examples. It's given me answers to most of my questions and when it doesn't have an answer I need, it gives me the information I need to be able to do a Google search to find the answer.  

[Klipp und Klar Grammar](http://www.amazon.com/Klipp-Und-Klar-Ubungsgrammatik-Grundstufe/dp/3126753280/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332806978&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr0).  Covers all grammar, one page per topic.

**Colloquial German:**

[Dirty German.](http://www.amazon.com/Dirty-German-Everyday-Slang-Whats/dp/1569756732): Regional slang phrase book!  A bit ridiculous and probably a bit off but has a lot of information in different categories.

**Courses / Learning Systems:**

[Assimil German With Ease](http://www.amazon.com/German-Ease-Assimil-Method-Books/dp/270051050X):  This is the course that really got me going.  It's horribly translated and light on the Grammar, but the method itself is simple and self contained, which was enough to keep me interested.  And the dialogues are funny!

[Assimil German Without Toil](http://www.amazon.com/German-Without-Toil-A-Cherel/dp/2700500067/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332721607&amp;sr=1-1): The older version of the With Ease course.  It's much much much better translated and it has more vocabulary, lessons, and is better about Grammar / introduces more complex concepts earlier so that you learn them over better.  The problem?  It's 50 years old.  That can be rectified by adding in some technology vocab and looking up outdated expressions.

[FSI German Course](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-German-15-Compact-Discs/dp/0812078691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332721705&amp;sr=1-1): Old as hell and full of typos.  This will basically drill grammar into your brain.  Which is what it's good for.  Sloppy audio recordings get annoying and it's hard to keep yourself awake (also the course is horribly outdated because it's some 50 years old), but if you learn well from rote then this is the course for you.

[The Michel Thomas Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Thomas_Method): A nice linguistic approach to building a solid foundation in German.

Look at that number. Look at it hard. Stare it down. Do you see the sequence of two times an 'e' staring you down yet? If not, you should. They have haunted you all your life and only now will you be startled to make a life-altering, mind-bending and stake-raising revelation. The universe will bend and fold inside your brain as it happens. The revelation is:

The 'teen' follows the 'thir'. Dangnabbit! Why isn't it tenty-three, just like twenty-one? Why must we bother with the awful three-syllabic 'eleven' when a simple ten-one does Japanese? Why did Lincoln feel he had to say four score and seven years ago? Why oh why?

Well, French does it like this, so we're not alone in that weirdness. A tour of the world in four twenty days.

*Le Tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours*

So, let's look at German once more. We can either have achtzig (Ah-not-too-much-sputum-from-back-of-throat-tsig). Acht-zig. Eight-ty. Simple as pie. Or just Vier-und-zwanzig. Four-and-twenty. 

*Eins* - Einsam - Onesome - Lonely

*Zwei* - Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen - Second German Television (Far-seeing)

*Drei* - Dreiklang - Triad

*Vier* - Das Quadrat hat vier Ecken - Pronounced the same as the English 'Four', only the vowel is different.

*Zehn* - Zehe means toe. Zehen means toes. You have zehn Zehen. Say toe-tens and replace the second t with an h and you're halfway to saying Zehen properly. Like Tseh-hen.

You know where to find the rest of the numbers. Your homework is to find them and a word that's somewhat related to them and post in a comment...

...

OK, I'll do another one, since I had primary dibs on it and because it's irresistible.

*Sechs* - Six. Pronounced just like 'sex'. Should be easy to remember.

...

And another one.

*Dreißig* - Thirty. It's pretty much the only irregular one, because Dreizig sounds geizig (guy-tsig) - greedy.",,False,,t5_2rd5y,True,,,True,t3_a778w,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/a778w/q_lesson_4_thems_cardinal_countin_words_some_of_em/,

In other words, why isn't it ""Der Tanz der Glühwürmchen**s**""? Does it only carry an ""s"" when it's masculine/neuter?

Another question I have is related to making comparisons using ""wie"". I understand that ""Ich bin so gut wie du"" means ""I'm as good as you"". However, what if I wanted to say ""I'm as good as you **at (something)**""?

Thirdly, I also recently learned the passive voice. What is more common in colloquial speech: To use the active voice with ""man"" or to use the passive? For example, would it sound more colloquial to say ""Es kann bewiesen werden"" or ""Man kann es beweisen""?

My last question (I promise) is related to using definite/indefinite articles with nouns. When I read German I seem to see a load of nouns with definite articles: ""im Oktober"", ""mit dem Zug"", ""er ist im Bett"" even when the location of the definite object is unknown or ambiguous. Is it just a manner of speaking that I can't relate to, or is there a certain rule to abide by for when to use definite/indefinite (e.g im bett vs in bett)?

I think I've realized my mistake and that was I was thinking too literally in my translation to English. From the start I've tried to never do this, but I think I was having an off day. ;) I realize now (after a good night's sleep) that I deal with this type of sentence all the time, but it's something I've just figured out on my own. Since starting to teach myself in February, I've never seen anything point out this structure and how it differs from English, and now suddenly seeing it in this book confused me into thinking it was something else. 

I'm working from an eBook, ""Practice Makes Perfect: German Sentence Builder"" and I've reached a part that says:

&gt; German sometimes uses an indirect object with non-human animates, a structure that would sound strange in English. To illustrate that point consider the following sentence:  Der Schäfer scherte den Schafen die Wolle.

The thing is, this section is about the different forms of ""was"" and how to create different questions about a single sentence, so this is the only mention and only example of this kind of sentence.

How common is this sort of sentence structure compared to using the genitive or a prepositional phrase as we would for a sentence like this in English?

In Duolingo when you go through the lessons sometimes it will give you a sentence in English and then 3 choices of how to write that sentence in German (or whatever language you're learning). In my case I got the question ""The woman eats a sandwich"". Sometimes there can be more than one correct answer, sometimes not. 

Anyway 2 of my 3 choices were ""Die Frau isst ein Sandwich"" and ""Die Frau isst einen Sandwich"". Up until that point I'd only seen it written as ""Die Frau isst ein Sandwich"" so I picked that as my answer.

1258989017.0,11,self.LANL_German,a7aon,DC's first lesson: (Beginner) Genders of Nouns,DCMurphy,11,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/a7aon/dcs_first_lesson_beginner_genders_of_nouns/,"First of all, I'd like to give you my credentials. I've been studying German for the last three years at my University. Currently I'm an exchange student at the Technisches Universität Braunschweig in Braunschweig, Niedersachsen, Germany. I'm only 6 credits away from earning my Bachelor's in German, and I'm also involved in a business program in the Uni.

The German language, unlike English, has three genders that a noun can take. It is important to learn the gender of the noun with the noun itself. There is no easy way to do this, it is just memorization, but there are a few tricks that you can employ.

The gender is so important because German uses a declension system. The Accusative, Nominative, Dative, and Genitive cases help to explain the function of the noun in the sentence. Nouns are easily identified because they are always capitalized, regardless of place in the sentence. The Genitive case is a little more advanced, so we will not be exploring that in this lesson.

First we'll start with definite articles.

Der - the masculine. The pronoun that goes with this is ""er"", or ""he"" in English. Used for all nouns that are an occupation performed by a man. z.B. Der Doktor, der Apotheker, der Fahrer (the doctor, the pharmacist, the driver).

Die - the feminine. The pronoun that goes with this is ""sie"", or ""she"" in English. Used for all nouns with an occupation performed by a female. z.B. Die Krankenschwester, die Lehrerin, die Apothekerin (the female nurse, the female teacher, the female pharmacist). Plural versions of nouns are also always feminine. We will cover the plural in a different lesson.

Most occupations have both male and female forms that are similar. Simply add -in to the end of it to make it female. A notable exception is a nurse. Masculine: Krankenpfleger. Feminine: Krankenschwester.

Das - the neutral. The pronoun associated with this is ""es"", or ""it"" in English. The diminutive is used with ""das"" by adding ""chen"" to the end of a noun, sometimes putting an umlaut over the preceding vowel if it is an ""o"", ""a"", or ""u"". das Mädchen, for example, is a small girl.

So, now you know your ""der, die, das"", or the three ways to say ""the"". Next it's time to look at ""ein"" and ""eine"", of the indefinite articles, commonly known in English as ""a/an"".

Ein is used for Der and Das. Eine is used for Die. Simply enough, right?

Das Fahrrad ist kaputt. *The bike is broken*

Ein Zug kommt gleich. *A train comes soon*

Ein Löwe frisst den Hund. *A lion devours the dog*

You may be looking at that last example and say ""den? We never heard of a den! What kind of crap is this!""

This is the Accusative (Akkusativ) case. It is used with some prepositions but always indicates the direct object. When the noun in question is a Direct Object, Der turns into Den, while Die and Das stay the same. Easy enough, right?

Now the Dativ case is used with other prepositions, but will always represent the Indirect Object used in a sentence. 

In the Dativ, der and das turn into dem, and die turns into der.

So, here's a synopsis of the gender changes (indefinite articles):

Nominativ &gt; Akkusativ &gt; Dativ

Der (ein) ------- Den (einen) -------- Dem (einem)

Die (eine) ------- Die (eine) -------- Der (einer)

Das (ein) ------- Das (ein) -------- Dem (einem)

*I am. Ich bin.*

*Du bist. You are.*

*Es ist. It is.*

Es ist ein Erdferkel. It is an aardvark. You may wonder at the similarity between the hardly English word 'aardvark' and the German word 'Erdferkel'. Well, 'aardvark' escaped from Dutch. Dutch is, in some ways, halfway between German and English. But the distinction cannot necessarily be made that lightly. English came from an island. The linguistic influence that this tiny poor country of a few million had before the 1500s was negligible and it was only ever a subject of linguistic changes from outside or inside, never inflicting them onto others. English is what it is today because it became a simple language that simplified yet became more idiosyncratic in isolation. Pronounciation went up on the weird scale, instead we don't have to worry about complicated conjugations or declensions.

*Huzzah! Oh, hang on, we're learning German here. Damn.*

Was will ich? Was willst du? Was will es?

All of these are simpler, yet more complicated than the English 'What do I want?' and the same with 'you' and 'it'. You can however imagine some Shakespearean sentence along the lines of 'What wantest thou?'. It's exactly that, in this case at least.

*'Du bist etwas.'*

'Etwas' just means 'something'. Despite the way it looks, it's not a compound word. It's one of the weirdest words I've ever seen. It's etymology is completely [bullcrap](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/etwas) and one of the few words it's related to is the curiously adverbial 'etwa', meaning approximately. Etwas is weird. So, next we come to:

'Willst du etwas?'

Here endeth the lesson proper.

I am currently in a language course in Germany and I recently started making an application (Mac/PC/iOS/Android) to help myself learn German grammar.  It is still very early in development, but do I have multiple choice, sentence building, and fill-in the blank (I am not too sure about this with mobile platforms) working.

For the level of german, I am planning on first having A2-B1 german in the application.  I am currently taking classes for B1 so I feel that it would be easier for me to accomplish.  Also, my wife and her father (german teacher in Gymnasium) are looking over the questions to make sure that there aren’t any mistakes.

I will have multiple questions for each section and I am hoping that I will have enough questions so that it will be hard to just see the same questions repeated over and over again.

I am not thinking that I will turn this into an app that teaches you german, just an application that you can use as a supplement to aid in learning.  I also don't think that I will be adding vocabulary right away as there are plenty of websites already that do a good job with that.  However, I might add it in the future so that there will be an easier way to learn the vocab that you need for the A1-B1 german tests.

I will release you all a beta a little bit later when I have more questions and usability in the app.  I am hoping that this will be soon, I am having a small alpha test with my class on Friday with a very limited selection of examples.

I will try to use your feedback to make it an application that you all will find useful.  If I do decide on making this a paid application, I will be sure to send LANL_German plenty of gift codes.

I'm a German teacher and recently a student asked me a question that I wasn't entirely sure how to answer, because I have received mixed answers from different people (all of whom I respect very much.  They are all native speakers and language instructors).  After some looking on the internet, I found MORE mixed reviews.  So I turn to you reddit.

While I normally am very comfortable with German word order, I am slightly confused about when we have three verbs which are all at the end of a sentence.

So take for instance the sentence:  
&gt;""Ich kann morgen schwimmen gehen""

When we place that into a relative clause, it looks something like:  

&gt;""Ich komme nicht mit, weil ich morgen schwimmen gehen kann.""

Here comes the question:  I have heard that when you have three verbs at the end, the conjugated one actually goes before the others; hence in this case it would end up with:
&gt;""Ich komme nicht mit, weil ich morgen kann schwimmen gehen.""

Which of these sounds more correct to the native speakers?  Does it depend on if you are using some specific type of verb (i.e. Modal or Auxillary?)

To take this to a further extreme, what when we have 4 verbs at the end?
&gt;""Ich komme nicht mit, weil ich gestern habe schwimmen gehen gekonnt""

vs

&gt;""Ich komme nicht mit, weil ich gestern schwimmen gehen gekonnt habe.""

***I realize most of the time native speakers would probably use konnte, rather than habe gekonnt, I simply used it has an easy extension off the sentence I had been using.

As for nieder versus niedrig I have very little idea of the differences? It seems that perhaps nieder is used more in the physical sense, like a low valley, where niedrig is used more as a concept like a lowly person, but I have also seen it used for low ceilings etc. so I really have no idea.

Jedes Sylvester oder Nuejahrstag, erinern viele Leute sie an dem letzten Jahr, und wie sie ihres Leben besser machen können. Sie wählen ein paar Sachen, dass sie machen können, und versuchen sie diese Sachen zu tun.Eine Neujahrsvorsätzen ist wenn mann eine Verpflichtung macht zu eine Ziel, ein Projekt, order eine Angewohnheit. Dieser Brauch ist sehr häufig in der USA und andere west Lände. Der Brauch ist sehr alt im Entstehung. Es kommt con die Babylonians, oder dies ist am ältesten, dass wir Dokumente im Geschichte haben. Sie würden am Anfang des Jahres ein Versprechen zu seinem Gotte machen. Dieser Brauch würde auch im alte Rome gemacht.
	Hier ist eine Lustige Zeichen, dass über Neujahrsvorsätzen spricht. Der große Hund sagt zu dem kleiner, „Was ist eine Neujahrsvorsätzen?“ Der Kleine antwortet, „Eine „to do list“ für die erste Woche im Januar.“ Eine“to do list“ ist eine Liste mit sachen, dass man braucht zu tun. Der Witz ist dass am meistens Leute machen ihre Verpflichtung nicht, so die Vorsätzen hat keinen Zweck. 
	Jetzt werde ich einige Statistiken für amerikanische Leute. Nach der Depression 25% der Leute machen vorsätzen. Diese nummer wird größer, wenn im das Jahr 2000, 40% der Leute machen vorsätzen. Eine Vermessung hatte gemacht, und nur 22% der Leute haben seine Verpflichtung komplettiert. Die Nummer is ein bisschen größer in Männer als Frauen. Die 4 sachen dass am häufigsten sind, sind hier. Leute versuchen ihre Karriere zu verbessern, ihre Gesundheit zu verbessern, mehr Geld zu verdienen, und eine Angewognheit zu abgewöhnen. Diese sind am häufigsten, aber es gibt veile sachen, dass sie machen können. 
	Letztes Jahr have ich 3 Sachen gewählt. Sie war „nach der Schule geh zu eine gute Uni.“, „Ich muss stärke sein.“ Und „Ich möchte mehr Bücher zu lesen.“. Wie man kann sehen, ich bin stark =]. Ich bin im Cornell gegangen, und ich habe viele Bücher gelesen. Dieses Jahr habe ich andere Sachen gewählt. Ich bin einen Ringer, so ich muss etwas für das wählen. Ich werde ein All- American sein. Das ist wenn mann 1-8 in der USA in ringen ist. Meine andere Ziel ist mein Note zu verbessern. Mein GPA ist 3.125 aber ich möchte über 3.5 bekommen. So natürlich, muss ich fleißiger lernen.
	Ich weiß, dass Sie werden sagen, warum macht mann diesen Brauch, wenn mann die Verpflichtung nicht komplettiern kann? Hier sind ein paar Wege zu helfen. Trennen Sie deine Ziel in kleine teile, dann können sie kleine Treppen nehmen, anstatt eine große Ziel. Wählen sie etwas realistisch, damit sie können das im realität machen. Erzählen Sie Ihre Freunde, damit sie können Sie helfen.

So, here we are. We knew that it has to come to it as soon as we want to put an object into a sentence. Basically, it's about the SVO ordering of the language. Subject, Verb and then Object. So, we've got a statement. Ich mag. I like. That, by itself, doesn't mean much now, right?

*I like. Ich mag*

Who or what do I like, you'll probably be compelled to ask? Well, they'll be the object of a sentence. In modern English, one might say 'I like you'. In old English, however one doesn't say 'I like thou', one says 'I like thee'. The 'you' used to change back in the past. Thus you can say something like 'Thee I like' without worrying that you've jumbled up the order. If you'd say 'You, I like' you'd say the same thing as well, but not without that comma, otherwise 'You I like' doesn't make much sense. 

*[Ich mag dich](http://images.google.com.au/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=ich%20mag%20dich&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi)*

How would you inquire about whom you like? Or should that be who? I don't even know. And here, we ask who or whom you like? However, there's a remnant of accusative in the pronouns of the English language. Who is liked by you? Me. Why not just 'I'? Accusative, also the same thing as objective. Usually. Ugh.

*[Declensions have disappeared in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Declension_in_English&amp;redirect=no)*

Apart from pronouns and the increasingly selten 'whom', the objective (we can also call it accusative, mostly) has disappeared from English. Let's replace the verb: 'Who am I accussing? I'm accusing thee.' Somewhat ancient, somewhat idiosyncratic, but I hope you'll see the point. Let's just provide a direct translation in the interim.

[Whom and Who? are Wem and Wen?](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wen#German). But in a very complicated fashion.

Wen mag ich? Dich mag ich. Mag ich dich sehr (very)? Ja, ich mag dich sehr. Beschuldige ich dich? Wait a second... What's beschuldigen? It means accusing. 

*[J'accuse...!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%27accuse_%28letter%29)*

Where does the etymological trail lead? [Sculan](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan). Be-shall-ing. Accusing. Beschuldigen.

Ich beschuldige dich. Dich beschuldige ich.

The most ridiculous thing about this whole 'ch' thing is that it's not supposed to be pronounced like your throat has just given rise to a rebellion of your larynx. Unless you're speaking Swiss German or Russian, don't do it. Kennedy managed to get it down pat.

*[Die Bart, Die](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrTGyGSdrtI)*

'ie' is the same as one would pronounce 'ee'. Dee Bart dee, effectively.

*[Neunundneunzig Luftballons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQYQTFudrqc)*

Have you some time for me, then sing I a song for you. Of ninety-nine air balloons on their way to the horizon. Confusingly enough, 'eu' is a part of the word 'neun', meaning 'nine'. Which is a homonym of the German word 'nein', meaning 'no'. As the old saying goes: 'Nein!!!!!'.

The consonants don't really ever change. So, b as in 'beh'. d as in 'deh'. f as in 'feh'. t as in 'teh'. r as in 'reh'. You get the idea. Umlauts are similarly simple, actually. All you need is the right vowel sound and just close your mouth a tiniest little bit. So 'Erdferkel' would be pronounced by you as 'Ördförkel' if a German speaker had to write down what you said. 

*Why? Well, say 'oh'.*

Keep the sound 'o' in your mouth, then draw it together. You've got your first conscious Ö ever right there. Keep saying it, it's one of the sillier sound you can make, and you've got the right to do so. It's the same sound as an 'er' pronounced in the very front of your mouth. 

*[A clip about the Ä](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSw9ilEE8r4#t=0m15s)*

Next, take your right hand and hold your chin. Now try to say 'ay', 'ee', 'ay', 'oh' and 'you' in order without moving your chin. Those are the vowels as pronounced in English. It's fairly impossible.

Now say 'ah', 'eh', 'ee', 'oh' and 'oo'. If you can do it without moving your chin you've probably done it right.

*Probably.*

Having words that look the same as they're pronounced is a concept not really found in English. You'll find it in languages like Italian and Russian, where the pronounciation is highly similar to the orthography as well as Spanish, French or German, where there's still a huge overlap. Then there's English the irregular poster-child, going on its way to something like Chinese, where the shape of a word bear hardly about a clue about its pronounciation. Surely you should want to prefer something easy, right?

The pronounciation similarities can be misleading at times. Sometimes you'll know a word in German and English. A word like butter, just pronounced a little differently. And then you know the French beurre. 

So, when my grandpa was in a hotel in Mexico, he'd had no success with their recognising the word 'butter' as pronounced in English. So, taking a linguistic stab, surely the Spanish word for butter would have been something along the lines of 'butar'. This, of course, he said to a waitress. As some of you may know, the very similar word 'puta' has another meaning in Spanish. The Spanish word for butter is 'mantequilla'.

* Before **a**, **o**, or **u**, **c** = **k**; otherwise, **c** = English **ts** (like in *pots*)
* **ch** has multiple pronunciations:
 * Before **a**, **o**, or **u**, the **ch** is like **kh** but from the back of the throat, like Scottish *loch*.
 * **ch** before **s** (except when it is in the superlative suffix -ste[n]) = **k**; also in words of Greek origin
 * **ch** in the diminutive suffix **-chen** or in any other case is a voiceless version of a whispered laugh ('hi hi hi')
* **ck** = **k**
* **d** before **s** or **t**, or at the end of a syllable = **d**
* **g** before **s** or **t**, or at the end of a syllable = **k**; otherwise, it is hard (like in *go*)
* **h** is like in *hear*, unless after a vowel in which case it's silent
* **j** = English **y**
* **k** is lighter than in English and pronounced from the front of the mouth.
* **kn**, **pf**, and **ps** have both letters pronounced quickly.
* **l** is lighter than in English (not sure on details).
* **ng** - the **g** is nearly silent
* **ph** = **f**
* **qu** = English **qv**
* **r** at the end of a syllable or after a vowel is softened to an **ah** or **uh** sound; otherwise, it is from the back of the throat and like gargling.
* **s** has complex rules:
 * **s** at the beginning of a word = English **z**
 * **s** before **p** or **t** = English **sh**
 * **s** before a vowel = English **z**
 * **s** at the end of a word = English **ss**
 * **ss** (and **ß**) = English **ss**
 * **s** before any other consonant = **ss**
 * **sch** = English **sh**
* **t** is lighter than in English.

Which one of the following is the most correct here as I have heard them all, however they were all said by people who were also non native speakers. 

Wo moechtest du es mich hintun?

Wo moechtest du es mich lassen?

Wo moechtest du es mich hinlassen?

Wo moechtest du es mich setzen?

Or are all of these incorrect?

P.S. Im also not sure if that mich should be a mir. I cant think of any reason right now why it should be, but it just doesnt sound right to me. Then again it could be the sleep deprivation talking. If this part of my grammar is also wrong could you be nice enough to explain why?

* I is like EE (long) or like in *sit* (short).
* O is like in *no* (long) or in *hot* (short).
* U is like OO in *mood* (long) or U in *put* (short).

* Ü is like German I with lips rounded.
* AI (and EI) is like I in *fine*.
* AU is like OU in *house*.
* ÄU (also EU) is like OY in *boy*.

* Is all this correct? If not, where am I wrong?

""Im Jahre 1925 wurde die United Church of Canada (Vereinigte Kirche Kanadas) durch die Vereinigung der Methodisten, der Kongregationisten und der Presbyterianer geformt und aus der St. James Methodisten- Kirche wurde die St. James Vereinigte Kirche.""

Instead of it saying that the Presbyterians joined with the United Church of Canada, only about two thirds ended of joining. So I need it to say most of the Presbyterians instead of all. Could anyone quickly re-write the sentence for me with this change?

Duolingo's programming does not realize that they are just one word.  Furthermore Duolingo only excepts a few different definition variations for words.  My prime example of this is sich anmelden.  I have check in but for some reason Duolingo dipolar about the meaning of sich anmelden and sometimes it can only be translated at to log in or sign in.  I believe this problems also come from the fact that there is not enough context within the sentence to correctly translate them.  My last problem with Duolingo is that it is not flexible with word order.  Word order in German is flexible and, though not as flexible, in English.  I know that Duolingo is still pretty know but I was hoping to get some feed back on other user's experience.

I am a native German speaker that subscribes to this subreddit to chime in from time to time. I wouldn't call myself an expert in German grammar but I'd say it is at least decent enough to help new language learners.

I am currently learning Latin as a foreign language and I seem to learn equally as much about German grammar as about Latin. When you learned German indirect speech in school or college, did you learn to always use the Konjunktiv in indirect speech?

I can only speak from experience as a native speaker but it feels like this has died out almost completely in everyday use of the language. And I'm not only talking about your average Joe ignoring this rule, but politicians, respectable news anchors and pretty much anybody. To be honest, I wasn't even aware that this rule existed anymore. I dimly recall learning that in school, but since you never use it, you tend to forget.

As an example:

 ""Ich lese ein Buch."" 

Correct: ""Er sagt, dass er ein Buch lese."" 

Incorrect: ""Er sagt, dass er ein Buch liest."" 

Now if we forget to use it in the final Latin exam, that is going to be one full mistake (out of 20, we're allowed to make). Do your teachers bother with teaching the correct but dying out form? Do they mention that it has fallen out of use? Do they teach the incorrect but more widely used form?",,False,,t5_2rd5y,True,,,True,t3_t2sn4,http://www.reddit.com/r/LANL_German/comments/t2sn4/german_indirect_speech_and_konjunktiv/,

First we'll review our cases/subjects in the nominative. In **BOLD** are German, English are in simple text.

**ich** == ""I"" - 1st person singular

**du** == ""You"" - 2nd person singular (informal)

**er** &amp;&amp;== ""Him"" - masculine 3rd person singular

**sie** &amp;&amp;== ""She"" - feminine 3rd person singular

**es** &amp;&amp;== ""it"" - neuter 3rd person singular

&amp;&amp; - er/sie/es are all conjugated the same way

**wir** == ""We"" - 1st person plural

**ihr** == ""You""/""Y'all"" - 2nd person plural

**sie**%% == ""They"" - 3rd person plural for all genders

**Sie**%% == ""You"" - 2nd person singular (formal)

%% - Sie and sie are conjugated the same way. The 2nd person formal ""Sie"" is always capitalized in a sentence, regardless of position.

_____________

Now that that's straight, let's move on to some of our first regular verbs in the present:

- komm|en (to come)
- kauf|en (to buy)
- geh|en (to go) ^^

^^ note that gehen is only regular in the present.

In the case of verb conjugation, the -en at the end is usually dropped to form your root verb. In the examples I gave about, they are ""komm"", ""lauf"", and ""kauf"". Some verbs such as entwickeln (to develop) and klingeln (to ring) do not have the -en ending. In this case, simply drop the -n to find your root.

So, the verb additions are as follows, for normal verbs:

ich = -e (komme, kaufe, gehe)

du = -st (kommst, kaufst, gehst)

er/sie/es = -t (kommt, kauft, geht)

wir = -en (kommen, kaufen, gehen: same as the verb in the infinitive)

ihr = -t (same as er/sie/es)

sie/Sie = -en (same as infinitive and wir)

___________

The endings of these verbs are especially important because they help distinguish who is doing the action, which form of ""sie"" you're using (more ambiguous in speech), and which tense the verb is in. Here we've only dealt with the present, so that isn't of concern right now. In the next lesson, we'll cover the simple past and review using direct/indirect objects and the declension system to form more complex sentences.

Until then, if you have any verb questions, I refer you to [Verbix - German](http://www.verbix.com/languages/german.shtml). I've used this for my verb questions for the last 2-3 years and it's never done me wrong.

*Eine Kultur kann durch eine Sprache sich selbst  **zu** definieren.

This one was marked as a Wortfehler. Should I be using zum or a different preposition? LEO came up with nothing.

She underlined the first quotation mark as fehlendes Wort. I think the punctuation in this sentence is wrong, but I'm not sure where to begin. 


*Eigentlich hat amerikanisches Englisch schon durch seine Geschichte mit vielen anderen romanischen Sprachen gemischt.  

Either 'hat' or 'amerikanisches' is marked as fehlendes Wort. I checked and h. gemischt is right on LEO. Could it be a conjugation error? Could it be 'war'?


*Dann hat durch den normannischen Eroberungszug Französisch eingedrungen. 

'Hat' is marked as incorrect for Subjekt-Verb and Verbprobleme. I already changed it to singular 'hat' Again it's h. eingedrungen, so I'm guessing it's supposed to be 'war' or some other participle. 


*,dass mehr Wörter nicht von der spanischen Sprache amerikanischen Englisch schaden können. 

Englisch has a D over it (I'm guessing Dativ?) and an arrow from schaden. Is schaden a dativ verb? I already corrected amerikanisches&gt;amerikanischen. 


*Aus meiner Perspektive würde dieses Verbot diskriminieren, weil viele rechtsgültige Bürger im Arizona, zum Beispiel viele ältere Menschen, nur Spanisch können

'im' is underlined and, ich glaube, that she wrote 'worauf' over it. I'm not sure what is referring to. What other preposition could I use to describe people living in a state? If it's just 'in' i'll feel silly.


*Additional questions: Wie sagt man auf Deutsch 'business hours' or 'during business times'? In the context of, they don't want employees speaking spanish during business hours or on 'official business'.

There are two types of constructions I'm curious about. Being a native English speaker, I don't know the exact grammatical terms for them, so I'll give examples of them.

The first fits the form of ""**____, ___ing**"" or ""**___ing, ____.**"" By this I mean sentences like:
* ""He ran through the corn fields, *pants hanging around his ankles*.""
* ""*Being a native English speaker*, I don't know the exact...""
* ""She ran, *waving*, beside the train, *lengthening her pace with each chug of the engines*.""

The second type looks like ""**[my/his/her/__'s] ___ing.**"" Examples:
* ""*Your hiding* is futile. We will find you and you will be assimilated.""
* ""*My burning of the orphanage* was a reprehensible action and I apologize for it.""
* ""In Shakespeare's Hamlet, *Polonius' meddling* leads directly to his death and Ophelia's subsequent madness and *drowning*.

I think that I've seen the first type used a bit before in German, and I remember that it's kind of similar in German, but a little bit different. As for the second type, I think that it'd be pretty much the same in German, consisting of the infinitive of the verb. For my reasoning, consider that in English the verbs in these constructions can often be replaced with a matching noun (and in some cases it sounds awkward if one doesn't). E.g. ""The mayor's senseless destruction of city greenspace"" v.s. ""the mayor's senseless destroying of city greenspace."" However, I'm not sure of this, and I'm curious about how other elements would be added to the verb in German. Does it work like any old subordinate clause? I.e does ""Dein zu schnell dein Rad fahren ärgert mich so viel."" make sense? (Your to-fast-riding of your bike is annoying me) Yes, I know that this example sounds awkward, but is it grammatical?

So yeah, can someone please explain how these work to me (or post links)?

- Mutter, Mutter, ich habe noch einmal einen Einhorn in dem Wald gesehen! Seine Mutter Angern sich über ihn, aber sie sing mit ihm in den Wald. Sie sahen kein Einhorn.
 - Ich habe dir gesehen– do sollst nicht lügen! Ich will nicht ging mit dir in den Wald nächste Mal – du bist nicht vertrauenswürdig!
- Ich lüge nicht! Ich schwöre! Ich habe ein Einhorn gesehen! Noch einmal, sie hörte nicht zu und kam nach Hause zurück. Sie war sehr enttäuscht, dass ihr Sohn ein Lügner ist. Hans war traurig und stille.
Kurz danach, die Mutter sammelte Pilze in dem Wald. Danach sie verlief sich und hatte viel Angst.  Plötzlich, sie sah ein Einhorn! Sie fragte ihn:
 - Ich habe mich verloren. Kannst du mir die Einweg anzeigen?
Das Einhorn bejahte und sie folgte es und es führte sie nach Hause. Ihr Sohn wartete für sie. Sie weinte und sagte
- Entschuldigung mein Sohne, dass ich habe dich nicht geglaubt! Ihr Sohn verzieh sie und sie verabschiedet sich von dem Einhorn. Danach sie lebten lange und glücklich. Ab und zu sie sahen das Einhorn in dem Wald.

I feel like I learned a little through context pictures and what not, but after reading some posts on how Duolingo is much better and how people should avoid RS, I got worried. I looked at Duolingo for just a minute and it already had a different way of saying ""my name is"" than what I learned with RS. Granted I didn't start Duolingo or look at it any further, I am worried that if I switch learning programs in the middle it would mess me up.

I was a German major in college and was about a B2/A1 proficiency when I graduated (I actually am certified B2, but my mentor thought I would likely have had a low pass of C1).  However, it's been about 3 years since then, and I am aware of losing my proficiency in a major way.  In particular I have found reading German to be very difficult.


Basically, I want to regain my lost proficiency and improve my reading, listening, and speaking competencies.  But I don't know how, exactly - I tried an adult language course but an hour a week wasn't enough to really help and wasn't worth the tuition.  I've been interested in building up my reading with simple books, but I don't know where to start.

Anyway reddit, please let me know your struggles and how you've overcome, and also please share any good methods for improving reading and listening outside of a classroom setting that you may know.  Vielen Dank!

I am considering taking first semester German. 

I have wanted to learn German for a while, my ancestors are from Germany, and I'm interested in traveling to Germany someday. My question is would taking one college semester of German be helpful, or should I focus on learning it on my own? Since I'm graduating in the spring, I won't be able to continue taking college German classes, so any further learning will be done on my own. Would the one semester give me a jumpstart on the learning process, and at least cover the basic grammar needed to continue learning on my own? How much should I expect to get out of this class? 

For the record, I attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I noticed the sidebar here links to some resources from UW, so I assume our German program is highly regarded.

But, (at least to me, an English native) some adverbs (such as not, only, etc) feel like they are tied to a specific noun and while they could be in different places in the sentence, that would change the meaning.

Example: ""I gave the red book to him only."" vs ""I gave only the red book to him.""
Here, the only could mean that I gave the book to him and no one else, or that I gave him only that book, and no others.

In German, is there a difference in meaning between:
""Ich habe das rotes Buch nur ihm gegeben."" and
""Ich habe nur das rotes Buch ihm gegeben.""
?

And if that difference exists, does the adverb then become a part of the noun phrase, and must be included with it? (I ask because that would affect whether the verb is the second element in a sentence.)

Ex:
""Nur ich darf dich küssen""
""Ich darf nur dich küssen""
""Nur darf ich dich küssen""
Is there a difference in meaning between these sentences? (I interpret it as the first one meaning that the speaker is the only person allowed to kiss the other, the second one meaning that the speaker is allowed to only kiss the other and no one else, and in the third sentence the adverb is alone and applies to the the whole sentence; the speaker can only kiss the other and the other can only kiss the speaker. Is that correct?)

Vielleicht ist die Verwendung solcher Wörter außer der Kraft menschlicher Erklärung, und muss eben auf die harte Tour errungen werden. Trotzdem möchte ich es versuchen. Ist der Ruf Dudens berechtigt, muss sich eine Erklärung irgendwo darin befinden.

Englische Erklärungen zufolge ist dieses Wort in folgenden Situationen in Aussagesätzen zu benutzen:

* auch betont, so Martin Durrell, die Gründe dazu, warum etwas der Fall ist (oder ist es nicht). ""Günther sieht heute schlecht aus."" ""Er ist ja auch lange krank gewesen"". ""Das hättest du nicht tun sollen"" ""Ich habe es ja auch nicht getan""

* Laut anderen Quellen ""The sense is not so much of an additional point as of a rejoinder that matches and fulfils an expectation implicit in the prompt"". Es fiel mir schwer, mir diesen Satz zusammenzureimen. Dennoch glaube ich, der Verfasser wollte sagen, die Benutzung sei also einigermaßen breiter. ""Er hat all sein Geld verschwendet"" -- ""Der hat auch nie was getaugt"". ""Der australischer Wein ist leider schon ausverkauft"" -- ""Den wollen wir auch nicht"". Der Partikel scheint also zu benutzen sein, wenn man erklärt etwas, was schon erwähnt ist. Stimmt das?
