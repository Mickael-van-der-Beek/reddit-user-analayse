I love this subreddit, I try to be active in it when I find time too. It's great to have an audience that are openly willing to give you feedback, especially when that audience contains some great designers.

What I've noticed a bit of lately is a stuck up attitude to a 'critique'. The idea of this community is to give each other feedback so we can all improve as designers, it's also great to read others feedback so we can learn even if we're not the one who submitted the original design.

If you submit a design, especially if you're new, it's likely there's room for improvement. True, peoples opinions on a nice design are different, but there are foundations such as use of the golden ratio, typographic hierarchy, page layout, colours and so on that all designers agree on. If you're design is missing some of these elements then your design will be **criticised**. Personally, I try to criticise all the bad points AND point out all the good points so people not just know what's wrong, but also what's right.

There've been several instances as the community has grown whereby people submit their work and react badly to feedback by arguing that their design is perfect or simply throwing toys out of the pram and deleting the post. This is not what this community is for, it wastes your time, it wastes others time and no one gets to learn anything.

* You will **never** need more than 3 fonts on anything. 
* More often than not, 2 is plenty. 
* I'm serious. Restrain yourself, never ever use more than 3 different fonts.
* If you must, use different **weights**, **styles**, or **colors** instead.
* (IMHO) Serifs on screen -- only in headers or logotypes, never as body.
* [Learn](http://psd.tutsplus.com/articles/techniques/a-20-minute-intro-to-typography-basics/) the basics of typography. It wont take 30 minutes. 
* Remember, you know what it says because you wrote it, but your audience doesn't have that luxury. **Never sacrifice usability for aesthetics** (because you're wrong: If I can't read it, it isn't aesthetic).

I hope this helps someone. I know it took me quite a while to let go of my rampant use of fonts, but it's doable! I still have a lot to learn, but that's what we're here for, right?

The target audience is small business owners.

Most of this time was spent getting the application interface right. The board didn't like my initial 'clean &amp; simple' approach and so i received orders to make it 'friendlier'. This was an abomination and grew into a horrible frankenstein of a project, which led to me redoing it in my spare time to show my OM how much better it could be, this included a product name, complete with logo and branding.

Anyway, that was approved which gave me a sense of elation. Then in the last few weeks i was asked to create login pages etc, so i came up with this:

http://i.imgur.com/Qc6qa.png?1

The other slides include a video and some examples of templates. Pretty standard stuff. Regarding the logo, i used the font 'bemio' for two reasons. The straight lines denote structure, and the curved edges give it a playful edge. Finally, turning the hole in the o into a spanner nut shape gives a subtle hint to the building nature of the product.

Anyway, since this has happened, there seem to have been some sharp u-turns in the boardroom. How much of this information has been delayed by my OM i don't know. But it now turns out a lot of the board don't like my design choices, including a couple who don't like the logo. One of the directors also owns his own smaller marketing agency who specialise more in print, and he commissioned them to do a mockup for the login screens:

Needless to say, there is a lot i don't like about this, but is my ego getting in the way? Is my design actually good? I don't know what to think any more.

Bear with me.

I enjoy reading this subreddit. For me it's an opportunity to give back a bit to the community, as I've largely improved and become the creative I am today by consuming all the critique I've received over the years. I always desire to improve, and crave as a result raw and constructive critique. I was fortunate to receive a lot of that from someone who knew what they were talking about. 

However in here, I've grown concerned at some of the comments that designs have received. Many of the individuals who post work are students, amateur, or fresh out of school and are looking to improve. They get feedback that is abstract, unhelpful, and at times, misguided... and then they try to apply it to their work. They grow disillusioned on their struggle to follow advice like ""don't use gradients"" not knowing why they have to avoid them. ""Don't use dropshadows""... so I can never use them? Stuff like that.

Nobody has told me of this frustration though. What I have been told more than once are comments and appreciation from individuals on the critiques I have provided. How I have helped them really understand how they can improve as a designer, and not just the one design they shared. 

At the same time, I realize there is value in a response from a large number of people. The issue is that those who don't realize it don't understand how to sift through all the comments. Because we are all faceless, our initial comments hold similar amounts of weight.

I'm not exactly sure if this is an issue. I feel it is, but am not sure how to tackle it, if at all. Do we allow for user flair to link to portfolios? Mark users as competent? I'm not advocating these necessarily because they opens up uncomfortable questions, but it's definitely some options I've thought about.

Is this an issue? Or should I just accept that things will remain as they are, and as a subreddit there isn't a strong enough desire to foster a more constructive environment. 

Thanks for reading.

**TLDR**: I'd like to see more constructive feedback that actually helps those who seek it. 

edit: great discussion thus far. I just wanted to add that if nothing changes as a result of this, I'm fine with it. I will still post as I have before. I realize that this is far from easy to solve. 

edit2: How do you all feel about a system where the person posting can choose a 'rating' on how serious the critique they are looking for is? For example, someone with just a minor interest in design can seek a less serious critique compared to a working designer who desires serious critique. Regardless of the rating the OP should be expected to take the feedback seriously. This doesn't solve the problem of poor critique being given, but it is one idea we could adopt. Maybe. Thoughts?

I started building a flat share listing company called Room Central ([roomcentral.co.uk](http://roomcentral.co.uk)) back in early 2012 and only just launched it in April 2013. Since I started the build, the site has changed quite a lot, especially with new functionality being added all the time. At the time I was working quite heavy in the back end code and didn't have the correct vision for the site so I decided to ask a friend at an agency, 200creative to help out. Since we've started I've been quite happy with the design, I think it looks quite playful and easy on the eye.

Because it's my own child I've instantly got a bias to thinking its great, but at the same time I think there is still some improvements that could be made. What I would really like is for everyone on Reddit to let me know what they think.

We've effectively got three markets:
1. Professionals who are looking for flat shares in a city
2. Students who are looking for flat sharing in a city
3. Landlords who want to list their rooms for rent

It would be really helpful if I could have some feedback from each perspective where possible, i.e. Does the site look trust worthy, do you like the colour scheme, is there anything missing that you would expect to be there, how quickly does it load.

Something that I'm also really keen to have feedback on is the map user interaction. Does it do what you expect and provide the information that you need?

The theme has been built from the Twitter Bootstrap so hopefully that have given some good support in the longer run.

1. There it is! 

2. The internet. Realistically, I think it would be fun to wheat paste some things. If anything, you get yourself out to a very large audience... So, the general public? 

3. Kind of became a thing of circumstance. I had a bunch of old illustrations that I had collected from various places and started making them into patterns. I've been working with a textile design agency for 4 years, so pretty much everything I make has some sort of pattern to it at this point. Then I started to sit and deconstruct them, and that's how they happened. 

4. Honestly curious to see what people think. It's hard to judge people's criticism when you can only get it from friends/peers/family. The internet is anonymous, so people seem to be honest.

almost a year ago, probably when /r/design_critiques started, i'd posted some work here or there to this subreddit and i got the kick in the butt i needed to push myself harder and farther. i've learned to dig deep and not to hold back. 

since joining this subreddit i have been chosen, out of 700+ students, to be recognized as one of the top 10 in my college. i had my work displayed at a gala event at a prominent hotel in front of many local professionals. as a result i have been asked to do work left and right, and was even picked up to do work for a local firm on a intern-to-hire basis. the firm loves my work and i've already had more work piled on me. i have also had my photo taken along with my work to be featured in a national magazine. not a major publication but still a national design magazine; it's a start. 

i am not bragging and i hope it does not come off as that. i just wanted to thank this community for pushing graphic designers, like myself, to explore the full potential of our design solutions. i appreciate all of the professionals and novices that i learn from on a daily basis.

A small background on the studio. We specialize in creating and design labels for private and national food brands. The studio is currently going through a rebranding and wanted to create a modern look since we are considering expanding into designing in other fields since we do specialize in different things. when this logo was created a few things where considered

1. I wanted the idea of the finger square to be there since that was emphasized by the director.
2. Since food is still what we mainly work in I edited this so that it would have a flow and almost have a feel as if it is ""wrapping around"" the center without being too direct about it
3. Logo/branding work is something we are considering starting to look working into. so I wanted to have a simple minimal look with this

Hi! I've been working on this IRC client with a friend for a while and I'd really appreciate some feedback on the design. The above picture is a mockup made with Adobe Fireworks but implementation is well on its way. I'm a developer, not a designer, and this is my first real attempt at designing something.

If you're not familiar with IRC, here are the basics: Internet Relay Chat is a chat protocol in which users can connect to networks/servers that host channels, which are like chatrooms. Channels have topics and the users in them are ranked, with higher ranks being able to kick/ban/etc. Users can directly message each other (called querying or private messaging) in addition to joining/creating channels.

Some notes on the design:

* The darker icons to the left of the channels/queries indicate unread messages
* The red number to the right of them indicate ""mentions""/""highlights""; this is when someone mentions your username. It's a very common feature for IRC clients to beep and notify you when you're mentioned so that you don't miss someone directly addressing you when connected to a lot of busy channels.
* In the actual chat window, the lines highlighted in red indicate a mention, and the lines highlighted in orange/yellow indicate a notice or a CTCP. Notices are sort of like queries, except they display on whichever channel/query you currently have open instead of in a separate query window. CTCP (client-to-client protocol) requests ask the receiving client for some info (e.g. CTCP TIME has the client respond with local time, CTCP VERSION with the receiver's OS/processor/client name and version).

Thanks!

Edit: [Here's a really crude rendering done in illustrator of the carpet in an interior](http://i.imgur.com/uic2X9l.png). I just found an image, pasted the vectors in and rotated the carpet to perspective, and put in some gradients to approximate the shadows. 

Anyways, despite my obvious inability to figure out how colors work on the web, what do you all think of the design? My inspiration was cities and their skylines (the center motif is Chicago!). I wanted to keep some of the feel of a traditional persian or afghan rug, but make it much more modern and bold in its geometry. I like the colors, as I think they would look nice in a bright and modern setting and be fairly neutral, but I don't know how practical it'd be as an actual carpet.

* How well does the history work on the [bump listings pages](http://dev.bumpworthy.com/bumps/all)?  I went with an infinite scroll on those pages, but history is always an issue there.  I wanted to get the user back to the listings page about where they left off.  I feel like it works pretty similarly to how RES works here, but is there any way it could be improved?

* Moving to an HTML5 video player.  Does it work for you?  If your browser doesn't support HTML5 video, did it fall back to Flash gracefully?

* Do you have any suggestions for layout on the [Artists listing page](http://dev.bumpworthy.com/bumps/by_artist)?  I HATE the really long, single-column list, but it is the least confusing layout I could settle on.

If people don't want to lose karma on the whole thing we could have a rule that is basically don't downvote something because you don't like it, give it a critique instead. Upvote what you do like and at the end of the contest someone could win reddit gold or something(No promises on that one yet, i'm still in college and still need to eat lol).

Spent today critiquing portfolios on my main account. Been subscribed to this place for a while. And portfolios are the most fun to crit. Decided it was probably time to submit my own for review. 

Background:
I'm a senior graduating this year. I'm not looking for any freelance jobs. My portfolio is just what I'm submitting in my job applications. I'm applying to both design firms and startups. The person whose looking at this site and making the hiring decisions will probably be a designer (I wouldn't go to a startup if there is not a designer on staff already) or a HR person with design knowledge. Most the firms will be small. I do not want to go into big advertising or marketing firms.

(Haha, although my preferences might change to ""anything as long as I can support myself"" the closer it gets to graduation)

Also in case you're curious, I do have more work. However, since I'm a student (and I don't care about finding clients), I was told by quite a number of designers to show only a very select few. 6-8 being the max. 

*Edit: Oh, also, I'd love to crit your portfolios too. If it's not on design_critique's front few pages, just link to it at the end of your comment.

The problem now is that I need it to be finished for my website launch on wednesday. I'm really finding it hard to be objective at this point, having looked at it constantly over last few months.

[The latest progression](http://i.imgur.com/IIKi8Fl.jpg)

Let me explain:

#1 is what my business card design looked like with what I thought was my final logo last week. I made it while being well aware of the fact that I was violating a lot of logo no-no's, but I thought, ""hey, it's for design, so it I'll be in control of how it's used and will adjust accordingly."" The core of the logo is my name, the buoy, and ""designer &amp; illustrator,"" while the water was just a secondary element that I would use in any instance I could. I also was using the dashed lines and anchor as part of my system for my resume and website. As I was laying out the site, I realized the water doesn't work well, the colors look too gimmicky, and the logo itself is boring without the water.

My site design has gone to a white and grey color palette, and my resume and business card will too once I get the logo figured out.

So after doing more reworking, I've progressed from #2-#7

I've gone back to the tried and true black and white logo (sort of, gray-scale really). I tried to keep the geometric illustration style, but I'm realizing I just like it because it's a hip style that I enjoy, but it's not really adding to the logo.

By #5, I'm back to just 2 colors of gray. I like the direction it's heading, but I'm getting worn out. #4 felt like the buoy was a weird dot on the ""I,"" so I moved it and scaled it a bit for #5. #6 felt like the buoy was too grounded while it was sitting on the baseline, so I moved it up to make it appear more like it's floating for #7.

That's my long shpeal. I could use any feedback right about now, so hit me hard with whatever criticisms or suggestions you might have. I really appreciate the help!

Inspired by [Blotto Design &amp; All The World's a Page](http://www.all-the-worlds-a-page.com/) I made a poster with all the text of Nineteen Eighty-Four on it. Was going to put quotes from the book on it, like ""Down with Big Brother"" and the ilk, but I kinda like how clean this is. [How would you change it?](http://imgur.com/T640DBo)

Done in Illustrator at A2 size. Text is 2.5 point (I tried colouring it, but it took 10 mins to render, then another 5 to re-render if I panned the screen, so decided it wasn't really worth it.) Don't know where I can host the .ai, but it's much clearer on that than a 2.5mb png!

Also did the quotes at the bottom in [ZXX](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672908/a-typeface-designed-to-thwart-nsa-surveillance) which suited the theme almost perfectly, but didn't look particularly [legible](http://imgur.com/vckhimd) when set against the book text (although it does look pretty cool.)

**Target Audience:** non-profits and small- to mid-size businesses who are ready to take the next step in organizing and streamlining workflow, so that they can responsibly, efficiently grow into their next phases (businesses that are still manually entering time sheets- or having multiple people put hands on the same piece of work because no one has taken the time to figure out the best way to approach the task- they've just been doing what they have to do to get by- Concilium comes in and streamlines).  
  
**The Mark:** based off of gantt charts, which are used by a variety of people when it comes to completing projects and project workflow, and which this company will use.  
  
**Colors = Main Concern:** client's unsure about the colors. I'm pretty sure about them- but the clients and myself are all avid redditors and we were hoping you guys might be able to critique these colors. The idea behind them is that primary colors are building blocks- so the blocks (golden rectangles) in the abstract gantt chart mark are simple shapes/primary colors and set in logical increments, leading upwards into the name of the company (""using logic to turn your company's basic elements into something greater than it is now, through order""). I've muted the colors a little, to refine them a bit (since primary colors are kind of loud and often seem cheap).  
  
**Looking Ahead / Further Branding:** the idea here is that these muted primary colors will be used throughout the branding material as accents rather than large expanses of color. We want to keep materials focused on what is necessary, and keep it relatively buttoned-down, as far as branding goes. The idea behind that is simplicity, not only because this company is giving clients materials and processes that they just need to use to make their processes more efficient (and not be dazzled by branding- this is not a business of luxury, entertainment / delight), but also because it works well in keeping with the idea of ""trimming the fat"" and just getting right down to business.

I'm looking for some feedback on my site re-design that I've been working on for about a month, about five hours a week (if that). I've been working on the site strictly in HTML/CSS/JS instead of going from a mockup. I figured it'd be a good exercise.

That aside, our target audience is two types of folks:

1. Small to medium sized businesses
2. Marketing firms, and creative firms in general who we often partner with.

Without further ado, http://studioaceofspade.com/saosv3

The goal is to be responsive (not there yet on phones), as well as to convey who we are extremely quickly. 

The other thing that I'd like to point out is that our messaging is key. On our other site designs that we've used, we have done extensive A/B testing looking at whether or not it's more important to have messaging up top, or portfolio items, or to try and squeeze in both. It turns out that messaging resulted in a 20% higher contact rate and 40% more page views (just that one change!). People who were interested would just go straight to the portfolio.

Anywho, thanks in advance!

EDIT: The site is best viewed on widescreens (+1680px wide). We have not done a different layout for a lower resolution, so yes, I am very aware that this will appear HUGE on smaller laptop screens. That will change so that the three Design, Development, Consulting icons will be above the page fold for 91% of our target market according to our analytics, excluding phones.

I did my best to incorporate people's suggestions (at least the ones I had time to address.) Specifically, I removed the drop shadows and tried to get rid of the ""clip-art"" look by layering splashes of dark grey beneath the illustrations. I think the texture adds depth and helps unify the background with the illustrations. Thoughts?

Additionally, I worked on alignment and spacing, but that is certainly not my strong suit. So please let me know if there are any glaring errors!

Also, I really appreciate everyone's thoughts on the legibility aspect. I have my concerns, but this dark background/white lettering, as well as these specific fonts, have already been approved by the client. (I made a sign in the same style as this menu that went over well.) 

Thanks again! I'd love to hear thoughts on the most recent version.

EDIT: Thought I should point out that ""the hive"" font/white box situation is the pre-existing logo for the nightclub, and thus not in my control. I'd love to hear thoughts about whether it has been incorporated naturally and/or ideas about how to make it flow better with the rest of the design.

Hi there, wanted to submit this for some quick feedback from you all. If you could take a look and let me know your thoughts, I'd really appreciate it!

The menu is to be printed on two A4 sheets and folded down the center (the vertical white lines in the center of the images mark where the fold will be, and are not part of the final design.)

The basis of the design is a combination of chalkboard lettering and vintage tattoo/pin-up girl style. All the illustrations are mine. I'd love to hear your feedback re: the layout and balance. 

Also one area of concern for me is the second pin-up girl on the inside left page. She is actually from an earlier project that went unused. I'm wondering if she stands out in a bad way because the rest of the illustrations are in a different style. I think it works, but that might just be me wanting to save time :)

Some of you might have seen this site while it was up - it got an unforeseen amount of press - but after being shut down I found that I still wanted some critique on the design.

I am trying to cultivate myself as a developer who keeps a strong appreciation and execution of design in my work. For this project, I really wanted to embrace grid design while keeping things simple. 

Part of the test for me was to have a site with a consistent design but also to make user pages utilize the styling those users keep on their actual twitter accounts. Some parts, the header on the user pages for example, were a little rushed because of deadlines, but otherwise I like the way it turned out. 

I should say, it looks best on computers with Helvetica Neue installed in addition to a browser with Javascript enabled, but I did make attempts to provide an alterative in both cases.

Thoughts? Could you also take a special look at little interface decisions? An example of this can be seen [here](http://undetweetable.com/SnoopDogg/90191642484682752) if you click the users name.

Also, I will probably make another post for the website. I'm sure it could use some help.


Things to consider:

* We're both in high school and have had no training in design or development - it's all self-taught. Please be brutal; every critique will help us.
* Is the logo too simple? Too vague? Too likely to be similar to someone else?
* Does the given color match? I JUST changed it from bright orange; I believe blue matches better.
* Does the font work?

I'm thinking there are better ways to represent information in mobile view. My approach was when person touches 'buildings/land' tab, i replace bottom navbar with contents of Buildings/Land, thus reducing one level of dropdowns.

I split the feeds into categories so that when you click a category bar, that category expands/contracts in order to reduce scrolling, especially in a tablet pc environment, and as an excuse to get a feel for javascript/jquery.

I'd love some criticism on it.",,12,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/1dpq3v/logoa_friend_and_coworker_recently_passed_away_h/,"So his nickname was ""Curty"", the summer camp is for middle school students, there are field days twice a week and field trips twice a week.  Field trips are to the beach, water parks, amusement parks, and so on.  He was legendary for his infectious giggle, warm attitude, and he was a master of dodgeball game variations.  

The C in his name is supposed to represent a dodgeball, the small circle at the top is the fill hole for the dodgeball.  The green hills are there to represent field days, but they are also intended as a little bounce for the ball.

The sun character is Curty, he always wore black oakleys, and he had a buzz cut.  He always gave people big hugs, so the rays are meant to represent his buzz cut up top and his outstretched arms and warmth radiating.

The blue is there to round out the circle and to represent water because with two field trips per week, at least 75% of the trips revolve around water, beach, etc...

The font is admittedly a ripoff of the disney font, it's called waltograph, and I got it from [dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com/walt-disney.font).  It works though, because he loved disney and recently took a trip there with his family earlier in april before he passed.

I honestly absolutely love the design. 90% of my friends do, too. The only worry is that the S is too similar to that of Skype's icon. Not in that it would be a TM infringement, only that it could be confusing.

The reason you see a variety of icons is simple.. a Google Chrome Extension can update its icon dynamically to reflect state. So, when you turn the volume up/down.. the bars will increase/decreases proportionally. Similarly, if the player is playing -- bars are green. Paused is represented by yellow (needs to be yellower) and muted is represented with red.

In my first paying job as an illustrator I would very much like a critique on my cover for the Norwegian band Sua Natura. 

With a very organic summer pop-ish sound I tried my best at reflecting their sound in the design. Everything is hand drawn and it is in its final stages with printing and release just around the corner. 

My biggest concern is the readability of the albums title (at the bottom). Any thoughts you may have on that specific element (or the entire cover) is welcomed.

Here is the site: http://new.insepsis.com/

Please let me know any suggestion, input, comments you may have. Anything is welcome. I am staying home for Christmas and am going to be working on this all day tomorrow trying to get it all ready to launch on the 1st of the year. 

PS. About 50% of the items in the portfolio are just old items that I had on my work computer. I am going to be updating it with better quality work once I get done with all the structural and coding work.

It is intended as a [Moo mini card](http://us.moo.com/products/minicards.html), so will be fairly small when printed.  Also, the invader and pixel font on the back is much crisper at full res and aliased. Obviously, the phone # and email were changed before the upload.

Any feedback? Is the ""Code. Design. Invent."" tagline cheesy or pompous? Please feel free to tear it apart if you don't like something; I am not thin skinned, and take criticism well!

A little background: I do some freelance code and design work part time for a fixed set of clients, and spend the rest of my time on personal projects/entrepreneurial development.  I do some physical design as a hobby, and often work with wood, which is the source of the front motif.  I also have a passion for game design, which inspired the space invader (which I made in sketchUp) and pixel font on the back.   I am not looking for work, but always love to meet new people and make new friends, so this card is meant as a simple way for me to pass along contact information to people I meet.

I'm brand new to the world of graphic design, but I'm looking to get a low-pressure design internship at my university. I figure I should probably come up with some kind of portfolio to show that I would be a good intern. So this is my first 'portfolio piece'- it's a logo for a friend's photography website. However, it's not quite there yet.

Like I said, I'm really new to all of this, so feel free to rip this to shreds and give me lots of advice! I'm using Illustrator, which I'm mildly familiar with, but any tips on effects I can use, strategies, etc. would be much appreciated.

Also, let me know if the bird looks more like a blob than a bird?

I am designing menus for my small mom &amp; pop BBQ restaurant.  This is the cover page.  We currently just have spreadsheets of our menus made up, which we print and laminate.  I'm looking to create something a little more professional-looking and eye-catching than these cheap, tacky menus we're using now.

I am using GIMP for photo manipulation (have taught myself what little I know about it over the past month or so) and PrintShop 2.0 for the actual layout manipulation.  The more I learn about GIMP, the more I'm considering dropping PrintShop from the program altogether.  It's like Playskool GIMP, barely more functional than ms Paint.

Note that the wooden pig is actually a 5' tall chainsaw carved pig that sits in our restaurant.  :-)

Things I don't like:

* The word ""menu"" and it's wooden background
* The campfire background of the page (I've struggled and struggled with finding the right background, this is imho the lesser of the 1000 evils I've tried out.  Suggestions please!)
* The border - maybe.  Is it too thick?  Does it need a border at all?
* All of the empty space in the bottom quadrants of the page, to either side of the pig.  But what could go there?
* The whole d#%* thing.  :-)


Things I *do* like:

* Our logo - probably because I didn't design it.
* The pig - he's sort of an icon/mascot.  His sizing or location are fair game for changes, though.

Thanks everyone!

EDIT:  I can take it.  Keep it coming...  The cold hard fact is that hiring someone to do this is out of the question.  We're struggling to make payroll most weeks, occasionally bouncing checks to suppliers, etc...  Trying to revamp our image through the menus a bit in order to increase value perception.

I have most recently been working on creating patterns from photographs and then mirroring them (cliched, I know) and basically playing around. None of them really have an intended purpose at the moment.

So, I am here to get some opinions on how I could improve these and/or which one(s) are worth printing.

I am an in-house designer for a custom apparel company called CreateMyTee.  There's a big back story to the situation, but the basics are that we've been a little bit stuck on where to go with the concepts generated by an outside designer, so I contributed some ideas of my own, some of which build off of the outside designer's concepts and some of which are more original (many were also pretty loose/rough.)  Turns out we're still stuck.

[Here is a link to a handful of the concepts.](http://imgur.com/TfsbiHE)
Some of them have pretty much been crossed off the list by the decision-makers but I included them anyway because I feel like they have promise.

In the concepts that employ 3 abstract elements, these elements would (at least in marketing materials) relate to the company's core competencies of design, speed, and service.

Thank you in advance, I look forward to your feedback and criticism!

And I've struggled with this one, finally being able to settle with ”It's ok if someone thinks it's too X”, as long as I'm comfortable with it, and it's not simply unusable as a logo.

But then I grew curious. So here goes:

**Background:**

I'm a freelancing graphic designer and illustrator. This is my personal logo. The process went back and forth, just feeling my way forward. I started with keywords like ”bold” and ”geometric”, but was not sure if it was going to be a monogram, a logotype or simply a symbol, what words to abbreviate (”designer”, full name, … ) and so on.

Then I simplified. Down to the initial of my first name (I don't need another name when being my own business), and combined it with the simplest symbol for graphic design and illustration: the pencil.

http://imgur.com/a/Ccx5L#0

I have not settled on a color scheme yet, which goes hand in hand with my coming portfolio site.

I know this is probably not something everyone wants, as even I'm not so sure, but it would add a little something something to people commenting surely.

But yeah, maybe a mod can offer some sort of ""contest"" to designers here to create a header logo as well as sidebar logo for the page, where users can vote on which we all prefer? And also during that time will be able to find someone willing to customise the page css, giving it a bit of life. I would suggest myself, but kinda cba as I'm sure there will be many others here who would want to have a go.

I am a graphic design student and this is a project I'm working on for an advanced typography class. The project involves creating a beverage brand/logo relying primarily on typography. I decided to create a brand of Hard Cider. I played around with a few different names that mostly seemed nonsensical, nothing really much to do with cider. Then someone in brainstorming half-jokingly said ""Bad Apple,"" and I decided I would go with it as a challenge to myself to see if I could give this silly name any weight with the design of the brand.

My intended audience was originally the quirky microbrew crowd, but I honestly don't think I hit that mark very well. However, I don't think it looks fit for the generic wine cooler market either, but I could be wrong.

Here's my first rough concept:

http://i.imgur.com/WYyKJ.jpg

I wasn't sure about the fruit icons - they seemed lacking. Like polygonal blobs of color. I also wasn't sure how to incorporate texture to them without bringing it into overkill territory or taking away from the logo type.

After a round of feedback, I came up with this:

http://i.imgur.com/jQwWo.jpg

My thought was to use this apple-shaped logomark throughout the flavor series, and use color and flavor name to distinguish between flavors. But I wasn't sure if that would be too boring. A friend giving me feedback was kind enough to mock up a couple extra samples, suggesting I incorporate a kind of ""flavor icon"" into the upper band with the flavor name:

**The product:** It's a simple trivia game: draw a card, answer the question. The numbers to the left are supposed to be random on each card, and when drawing a card you say a number between 1-4 and is read that question (i.e the difficulty is random up to Extreme). You can always choose Nightmare, but risk a penalty.

**The brief:** The client (my friend) asked for a clean retro look, Mad Men style. After some discussion he wanted to integrate that 60's look with 3D-blocks/pixel elements. 

**What is left:** The client is happy so far, and is leaning towards the second design (blocks for numbers and answers, not for questions). I am also supposed to design symbols for the three categories (In game, Hardware, General), and Special cards with three different special effects (Extra life, Continue, Star life).

The client also wants to experiment with a mascot, perhaps integrate it with the symbols. This is where I'm at now.

Like most of you, I'm an Anthony Bourdain, travel-food show junkie. I love seeing these distant places, people, and dishes that one day I hopefully will be able to experience for myself. To foster this idea, Housefed lets you find other foodies in your hometown and share a home-cooked meal with them. When you are traveling, then you'll be able to tap into the Housefed community to meet a local cook and book a meal in their kitchen. It is letting people share their food with people who wouldn't normally be able to try it.

So far a lot of people have signed up in anticipation of the meal-booking aspect which I fully opened this week. There are hosts in the US and UK that you can see their dishes, and book a meal with. Right now there are 2 meals in San Francisco that people can book a seat at.

I enjoy the art of design, have long lurked, and even tried my hand at commenting around here.  But I am not a designer.  I am a biophysicist.

My subject seems fairly ""designogenic"", but again, I am no designer. I have two objects (proteins) I need to represent.  One is called 'Notch,' one is called 'Delta' (Δ).  These objects fit (bind) together.  And they do so while extending from the surface of a cell.  I would like to find an aesthetically pleasing way to represent these objects in my work.  As these objects do not yet have known structure I can take some creative liberty to represent them.  And I'd like to do so.  I just don't have much of that creative part.  The images will eventually have variations and manipulations made to them which would represent my own manipulations of the protein. They would be used mostly in Keynote presentations.

If you [search google](http://www.google.com/search?q=notch+delta&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch) I think you'll find that for as amateur as my images are, most are truly ugly.  For something I will spend years of my life working with I'd like for it to be more pleasingly represented.

1) What exercises or techniques might you suggest to bring about a better form other than just scribbling on a sheet of paper?  (I'm a poor scribbler)

2) Are there any good sets of iconography that 'interact' with each other on a regular basis that I can take lessons or learn rules from?

3) Illustrator.  It's kinda hard...

Once it goes live, I won't be able to make any more changes, so, before it does, what don't you like about it? The site sells online seminars that focus on human resources. Most clients are being referred by promotional e-mails. 

My biggest fault, I think, lies in typography. I can't ever pick an adequate font.  Opinions?

The ""upcoming webinars"" div fluctuates in length by a fairly large degree. Sometimes that big blank space will be taken, sometimes it won't. What can I do to make it a bit less empty when there aren't many webinars going on that week?

Lastly, is it too corporate looking?

I've shown it to a few friends and acquaintances and their feedback range from complimentary to good suggestions, but I find that no one is as honestly brutal as design redditors.

A few more words about the purpose of the site; I am trying to find work in urban design and/or architecture. Web design is freelance work and while I'm not actively looking for tech work, it's helped me get interviews before, so for maximum exposure I wanted to show a range of design ability rather than create individual ""niche"" portfolios (although, please do tell me if this is a bad approach).

I just launched it tonight. It's a wordpress theme I made. It will look better when there are more articles posted and the homepage fills up a bit more. I'm having trouble getting the pointers at the bottom of brown boxes (blockquotes on pages, twitter updates on the homepage) to display correctly for all browsers, but that's more of a technical thing I need to fix.

I'm a little worried that I overused the background image (on every page other than the front) without thinking how it affected the content, but it can't think of what to replace it with. It's very appropriate for bio, mildly so for music and info, but it doesn't apply too much to store. I might remove it for the store page to allow more space for products and just keep the faded logo in the background. 

I'm also looking for suggestions on alternative formats for the music page, as it's very important to the site.

Thoughts?

After finding such a place, I instantly thought (having a photographers mind) ""I want to do something cool here"" and as I thought through it, the appeal of just having someone do things standing in the grass wasn't too good. I decided I wanted to add some real motion to this shoot and ended up borrowing a small trampoline to have the models jump of off. To keep this concise, the blankets, dress color and post processing came from inspiration as we pulled everything together for the shoot.



The final shot includes composite shots taken at the same time in order to form the final image.

Here's a step by step to give you an idea of how I went about doing it.

-The use of the logo is weird because this is one of the 4 restaurants on the resort, so regular branding doesn't really apply 100%.

- Mainly this will be on the menu (maybe) and a big wooden sign.

-The client wanted an oval around the logo and grill marks. I avoided using grill marks because it really kills the ""quality"" look of the logo. MIGHT ad a washed out look if the client insist.

I feel like the oval makes it look too much like a room number or address.

I'm also worried about the little swirls not translating well to print (im a pre-press guy by profession)

** Asking the client if they actually want the word steakhouse in the logo or not.

***Just 1885 it is.

****So stumped on this one.


-----------------
Update;


Second set:
1. obligatory what client wants.

2.I think getting rid of a border all together really helps this logo, the underlining strip is supposed to mimic the marks of a grill. Also it helps makes this logo aesthetically pleasing. Although as im typing this I realize they should go the other way to provoke ""flow"" as the viewer is reading. 

3. If they really want a border choose something other than a oval so it doesn't look so much like a hotel room number.

What the client wanted originally was grill marks through it, which I thought really took away from the ""classy"" look. 



I was going to add custom flourish inside the borders to fill the dead space, but they would really serve no purpose just extra crap.

**[TheNoteboard.com](http://www.thenoteboard.com/index.php)**

...and here are the shitty older versions:

[v 1.0](http://oldv0.rgft.net), right after I'd learned HTML.

[v 2.0](http://oldv1.rgft.net), boringass big wall of text, and yet somehow it still made my business go semi-viral.

[v 3.0](http://oldv2.rgft.net), I added sort-of navigation buttons (using *iframes, shudder*) of which I was really proud.

[v 4.0](http://oldv3.rgft.net), thought it'd make me look legitimate.

[v 5.0](http://oldv4.rgft.net), because more color's always better, right?

[v 6.0](http://oldv5.rgft.net), which wasn't bad, but was way too complicated for a single-product business.

I coded virtually this entire thing by myself from scratch, and I'm still pretty proud of that considering how I knew virtually nothing about HTML (let alone CSS, JS and PHP) a year ago.

Feedback [on version 7.0](http://www.thenoteboard.com) would be really, really appreciated! I discovered text-shadow and box-shadow in CSS and might have gone a little overboard.

I have 2 main questions.
  
My first question isn't design related but is on a potential copyright issue. My grandfather was a huge Packard fan and he was who inspired us to do this so we chose to use the ""Doughnut Chaser"" hood ornament (famous on Packards) as part of our logo. Is there some place we can find out if this is a copyrighted image? The Packard company was bought out by Studebaker in the early 50's and then Studebaker went defunct itself in 1967.   
  
My second question is design related. My brother doesn't like the font I chose. Does anyone know of another font that could be used in a design like this (classic, slick, clean)? I was also told the logo was rather bland and could use some color. I personally disagree but thought I'd see what you guys think. Does it need color?

A couple of months ago, though, I started dedicating a couple of minutes a day to coding a theme I'd try selling on ThemeForest. I basically made it up as I went - I had made a quick mockup in Fireworks, but things ended up looking nothing like it; so designing in the browser is apparently a very real thing, if anyone's wondering.

[Here's A look at a possible website portfolio front page image, and two sides to a business card concept, work in progress](http://imgur.com/a/Y5huh#0)


After a few iterations I've worked it down to one simple shape per letter, using negative space to partly form the letter forms, it is a tad abstract and obscure/illegible but in my opinion it's not crucial that people know what it is instantly (nike logo is not in fact a tick, it is the wing of the greek goddess Nike, goddess of flight, or so I was taught) , I may make it more obvious on my portfolio site through animation.


So let me know what you think, I'm a fan of minimalism and so maybe the shadows and gradients and hexagon background are way overboard, but removing it all that leaves it as a couple boring triangles. Not sure what to do.

Bascially the society is made up of doctors and professionals at the hospital, and is there to oversee things like holding events, fundraises, stuff like that. And on that note, that is the target audience.

Both the hospital and society have been around for about 150~ years and have an extensive history, but my client has said he would like to put more of an emphasis on focusing on the future rather than the past.

I am trying to capture the essence of the society, and create an identity that shoes both structure, connection and community. The reason I have chosen the hexagon is because the actual hospital logo features a 6 sided star that indicates 'hope for the suffering', so it is a nod to that. The hospital logo is also a shield, which I think when turned on the angle its on now, somewhat resembles that.

I haven't put any thought into the type yet. I am more after feedback for the image.

3.  Purpose:  It's for a poster in the background of 3D scene.  It's a minor element but I want it to look nice.  I usually do strictly 3D but I'm trying to get my design chops up.

4.  What brings me here:  I'd like some feedback on the design, especially on the font combination.  

Thanks everyone.

A while back I posted on here and /r/design looking for critiques on web design after my previous designer had been incredibly unreliable. Just wanted to give you all an update now the site is live!

I took a lot of your feedback on board, and there's lots of amends that will be glaringly apparent in the site design now.

http://www.controltheriot.co.uk/

1. The hierarchy of content has changed as per feedback. Date now takes a less prominent role.
2. All fonts have been updated to use Google Web Fonts.
3. The search bar was improved as per feedback.
4. The icons on the slider have been moved and resized to be more apparent.
5. Copy has been added to the feature image to make it more immediately obvious that it links to an article.

Just thought people might appreciate an update and like to see that their advice was taken on board! Really appreciate everyone's help, and wanted to say thank you to the community.

This is the logo for a stationery company that my boyfriend and I are starting. We're doing cards, invitations, announcements, etc. We're aiming to sell to sophisticated clientele looking for elegant and modern designs for their events and occasions. 

I was attempting to create something straightforward and clean, but still slightly whimsical and ""cute."" The font is Gotham Bold and I chose it because it the letterforms are even and the *o* and *c* characters are perfectly round, referring back to the ""stars"" that make up the constellation. The color scheme is self explanatory (I hope) and suggests a night sky. I'm on the fence, however, on whether or not the constellation should be brighter. On the one hand, I really like the subtlety, but on the other, I of course don't want it to be lost if it's on the blue background. More often than not, however, it will be on white and only on the blue when it can be printed at a reasonable enough size and printed on high quality paper with a quality press.

Through this program, I also receive the opportunity to work on co-op in the design field for one semester each school year.

[HERE](http://www.coobatis.com/) is my online portfolio, which I send to co-op employers in hopes of cinching an interview. I also occasionally do freelance work on the side and will direct potential clients to this site, as well.

I would like any critique concerning the layout of the site, my personal branding (both design and language), or anything else you may have to say!

**A few things to keep in mind:**

-I coded this website myself after a few courses in HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. I want this site to look as good as it can be, but while my skills may be limited, I still feel it's important for me to code this myself in order to showcase that skill I possess. I view using a platform like Squarespace as being a cop-out for me personally.

-I want to convey that I'm approachable/friendly and professional, while still having a slight cheekiness about me (which I also enjoy spreading into my work when I'm able).

-The work is diverse because our list of possible co-op choices is also diverse, so for now I do not want to pigeonhole myself into a certain area.

-I have some newer work I still need to add, including an interactive app (school), logo/branding projects (school and freelance), and environmental design (co-op).

-Although freelance clients are directed here, since I mainly use this for co-ops — which already have established rates — I am not listing any personal rates.

Anyways, the outline is a 'G' with the back removed in slight perspective that is meant to somewhat resemble an arrow, symbolizing a path and a circular process of learning and experience. Also, the 'o' in ""to"" makes up the dot of the 'i'. I certainly wasn't overthinking the design when I came up with it, but it seemed to work out.

* Body text.

**As well as:**
* General website layout
* General website content
* Background design
* Use of basic website principles i.e. CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity)
* Anything else you can talk about.

Also, I've made a comparison of two different layouts for one of the concepts. 

If you could assist me in this project, that would fantastic!

These are only concept **sketches** so are just images I created in Photoshop, rather than functioning websites.

By the way, Wellington's colours are black and yellow, hence I've chosen them as the primary colour scheme.

Also, the navigations on each concept I thought it would scroll down with the user scrolling down also, hence all the white space down its column.

The bare concept is that of transferring sound into textile design using both literal and lateral methods. 
I ended up using vibrations to transfer the sound for the splat design by bouncing paint off speakers and catching it on silk. I then Photoshopped it into a commercialised design which was then printed onto cotton poplin.
I recorded everyday sounds such as the toilet flushing, kettle boiling and light switch etc. These were the sounds I used to produce the samples and designs.
The other design is on pure silk and is a mix of screen printed sound-waves and laser cutting. It is predominantly pouring water as the sound-wave source, which I thought was pretty cool. 
Anyway, sorry, I tend to ramble.
I would be really interested/ slightly scared to get an honest critique.

I am not a designer by profession, this is just something that I have been doing on a side through out my school years.

The club is called Madison eSports. 18-22 years old. Our school is extremely strict on the usage of school's logos or mascots and we just decided to go out on a limb and create something of our own.

The idea is to have something that could be used as a logo for websites, pages, streams, games and printing... 

To start the process, I just went online and sort of analyzed the logos of professional eSport teams and tried working on something...

It ended up being XMAN style... The colors are our school colors, which are http://www.uc.wisc.edu/brand/web/colors.php ...

First, thoughts behind it:

I'm very into simplistic, minimal design, and am trying to reflect that in the logo. I'm also going for an logo that is very stand-alone, and has a 'symbol' feel to it. Related to that, when the logo is present with my work (portfolio site or what have you) I don't want it competing; the works should be the focus at that point.

My initials (NL) are present in both of the linked logos (albeit more noticeable in the first).

I was going for clean, minimal, and trying to reflect my design style and thought process. It doesn't say 'creativity' a whole lot to me though, so I'd particularly like input on how to address that.

The logo can be seen here: http://i.imgur.com/dLvkt.gif

Since then, I've been hard at work learning Drupal and coding my own modules. I have had a lot of hard time with Ubercart and ended up recoding the entire checkout process from scratch.

Among the things I'm happy about, the Floating shopping cart, the checkout pages and a few things that are coming out soon.

I'm planning my first portfolio site. I have always been hugely into minimalism when it comes to design. And while I plan doing/displaying other kinds of work in this portfolio, minimalism is going to be the main theme building it. And it feels appropriate starting with the logo.

The colors are just something I threw together for this presentation, but might be used in the final iteration. I like the concept of having [a logo that isn't always the same color](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Casa-da-Musica-Identity/4745703).

I'm not sure what letters people detect while looking at this. But I assume 'P I'. That is not correct though.

I have about 13 hours into it so far, just this much because it's the first time doing it and I am trying to make it as clean and organized as possible (check out the source code to see what I mean).  Everything is my own code except for the responsive template (1140.css, a VERY small, bare-bone 130 lines of CSS) and a few other obvious things like the slider on the front page.

~~[Resume Here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20237974/Resume_review_scitech_June12.pdf)~~

My target audience for this is engineering/research organizations that are searching for interns, entry-level temps, or part-time workers.  (I am also applying to some business and some communications positions, and the content is slightly different + I make the relevant skill--leadership, communications--the orange one).  The purpose of this work is to make an employer do a slight double-take during resume review and offer me an interview to find out more. 

I'm not a graphic designer by occupation, so I would be very grateful for any feedback you could provide on the design.  I'm particularly suspicious of the following items:

* Font in general - I'm a bit unsure of the Raleway/Calibiri pairing, and I think I might have too many different typefaces within the document.  I know that Raleway could be difficult during printing, and I have yet to test that. Thoughts?
* Layout/whitespace on the first page - something looks a bit off, but I don't know what.
* Timeline on the second page - I'm trying to figure out how to integrate slightly more information to make it much more useful (education, positions, etc.), but I'm at a loss.  At the moment, it is supposed to show how much time/energy I put into each area over time.  Any ideas?
* This is intended to be web/double-sided color print.  I'm making more versions for other situations - a b&amp;w one colored with black/grey/white and one that has easier margins to print.

Anyways, Long story short, I was so hammered I told him I'd make him a logo, and I haven't yet delivered because I've been busy.

The elements he wanted in the logo were as follows:

Audience is 6-8th graders, informational and intriguing poster about the solar system. I'm having a hard time organizing information, I feel like it's all kind of jumbled, I've tried alligning the edges of the planets so they're not centered so I could have a hard edge to place data, but it looks even worse IMO. I have the names of the planets with numbers on there to coralate with the planetary facts list.

Should I keep the numbers and names? Or loose the names, or both?
Do you think kids 6-8th grade will read the almost perdiodic table shortening of names in the graphs as planet names or get confused?

I was tasked to create the association logo, but someone decided to be creative too and made another proposal, and now we have to choose between these two.

We are a geeky association in a business school. Our target, and fellow students does not know this culture. They are all around 20 years old. That's why we decided to choose Vador as a symbol.
The chosen moto is : cool geek, hence the Raybans.
I retained the initials ""BG"", because it is not only initials but has another sense in french.

We want with this logo to affirm our identity and still be viewed as open and cool people.

* To give an impression of ""fun"" and ""motion"", the logo should feel active
* For the ""C"" and ""M"" to be readable
* The story behind ""ComboMash"" is that I take a combination of art, tech and other assets and ""mash"" them together into a product. Part of my business will be providing prototyping services to other people putting together projects.
* To have a high resolution logo that I could animate in 3D for a splash video, while also being able to have it be useful for print documents (black &amp; white).

Let's know what you think or which are the best/worst?

Also - I'm giving design critiques one last ditch effort for actual constructive critique/discussion, in the past I've only really got abuse hurled at me without any genuine help, this is not how critiquing works.

1370639239.0,7,self.design_critiques,1fvz8y,[Logo] Worth contacting a Community Centre with a new logo?,dxcucr,9,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/1fvz8y/logo_worth_contacting_a_community_centre_with_a/,"Hi guys, this is my first post here (in design_critiques and on reddit) so please be gentle!

I recently discovered the Royal Docks Learning &amp; Activity Centre and when I saw [their current logo](http://rdlac.org.uk/RDLACwebLogo2.gif), I decided that I could probably do better.

With that in mind, here is [my redesign](http://imgur.com/LlwzC5Z) which is a lot more simple and professional in my opinion.

The icon is a jigsaw puzzle piece to have a link between the two logos, but also to represent connectivity (I'm guessing this is why puzzle pieces are in the current logo). The icon is also meant to show an abstract crown and anchor to represent the Royal Docks.

I'm posting here because I firstly want to know what I can do to improve the logo design, but I also want to know if you guys think it's worth contacting the Centre with the new logo.

Please let me know, thanks.


EDIT: The RD / LA letters touching was intentional and I have also created [another version](http://imgur.com/WWuem5R) with all of the letters touching.

Long time since I've used all caps in a serif face and the double O's and RE are kind've throwing me off my game. Can I get some critiques of whether or not it looks funny? I currently feel like the M could move over to right a little but I'm also at my 28th attempt to kern this and figure it's time to step away from this and get some outsider perspective.
