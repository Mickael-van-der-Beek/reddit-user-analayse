1373936321.0,85,self.Velo,1idoro,I enjoy losing races. Seriously.,ireallylikeoranges,101,16,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1idoro/i_enjoy_losing_races_seriously/,"I am a cyclist.  No scratch that, I am a bike racer! 

I still hang out with a lot of friends I knew before I got myself wrapped up in this spandex riddled world.  Now if I were to see one of them at a party or a bar their first question is usually,

“how is the whole bike thing going for ya?”

Cycling has become a part of my identity.  They don’t know, can’t understand why I subject myself to isolation and self induced agony.  At least that is what they envision when I describe my daily habit. 

Waking up at 5 a.m. so I can meet a few teammates for a ride before work or class started, willingly going to bed at ten on a Friday night so I can wake up at six and drive four hours to race three hours only to be dropped a few km  from the finish line.  Its not isolation but drive.  Ambition. 

I have been racing for a few years now.  Most of my teammates would probably describe me as a “pretty good rider.”  They likely would not embellish my talents any further than that. 

I wouldn’t argue with that description.  I consider myself pretty good.  Nothing special. 

I rarely if ever win a bike race. 

I put in months of preparation each year, hours of daily work trying to improve myself.  At one point I had a coach and was following a very strict training program, logging what I ate and how I felt before and after each workout.  I pushed myself everyday to get better and I would still fail.  I still would not win.  I came close a few times.  I was leading a few races before a flat or mechanical slowed me down.  I got second to an extremely fast local.  That was cool.

In the heat of the moment I was disappointed, sure.  Angry with myself for allowing something to slip away or for not being completely prepared.

That said, I am still extremely proud of the small victories I accomplished.  From riding in a breakaway with people I had been admiring the year before or chasing down someone I only knew via social media.  I was getting better.  Constantly  improving myself.  And I knew it.

I think this whole bike racing thing applies a lot to life in many ways.  We are all trying to improve ourselves no matter what we do.  We all want to win the race.  We all want to get that new job or a bigger salary.  The thing to realize, however, is that we are going to fail most of the time.  We are rarely if ever going to win.  This small fact should not deter us from trying though.  Quite the opposite.  We should cherish each small victory.  We should see failures as glaring ways to improve ourselves.  

tl;dr, Keep losing.  It is good for you. ",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_1idoro,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1idoro/i_enjoy_losing_races_seriously/,

1361286685.0,38,self.Velo,18tjl4,Tactics Series Entry 2: Pacelines,like2ridebikes,42,4,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18tjl4/tactics_series_entry_2_pacelines/,"Welcome back to the tactics thread. My intro post is [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/17ycnr/biweekly_tactics_series_entry_1/)

For my first post I’m going to talk about riding in pacelines. This may sound counter-intuitive, as winning a race requires that one ride *out* of the group; however, a rider who conserves energy by riding smoothly and in the best position within the group will have more power available when s/he makes his big move to stay away. This week I am writing about riding in **pacelines**. I was going to write some tips for riding in a large group but it got long, so I’ll make a follow-up post next week. In the next regular entry (two weeks) I’ll start writing about what tactics to employ when it’s time to make a move for the win. 

I apologize in advance that this may not be as exciting as a discussion on winning the Tour, but these are fundamentals you will need to use so that you have the energy to implement the more exciting tactics. As usual, feel free to chime in with additional advice or questions.

[Open this diagram in a separate tab for reference.](http://shreveportbicycleclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/paceline_inset.jpg)

**P A C E L I N E S:** 

Pacelines are the most basic formations for a group of riders. They can be small (2 riders), medium sized (a break of 3-10 riders), and will often form at the front of a peloton. If you ever do a team time trial, good paceline skills and communication are essential. For now, let’s assume that everyone is working evenly on the front and the group is not attacking each other, like in a team time trial. You can still save energy compared to your break-mates!

**Single Paceline:** This is the most basic formation, and consists of any number of riders in a straight line. Riders in line can save 20-30% depending on the wind and speed. Pulls can range in length depending on wind, hills, corners, and the strength of riders in the group. After a rider finishes his/her pull, s/he will pull to the left and go to the back. Here are some tips for saving energy:

* Avoid braking. If you have to brake in the paceline, you pedaled too hard, and most people over-brake, so you will need to pedal harder again to regain your speed. The best way to do this is NOT to look at the rider/wheel in front of you. If you are new to the sport this will feel uncomfortable and it may take some time to learn. Try looking 3-5 riders ahead and spot changes in pace ahead of time so that you can pedal *easier* for a few seconds instead of braking. If the rider in front of you makes a sudden move, your peripheral vision will catch it and respond. Trust your instincts, and focus your attention on what’s happening near the front of the group.

* When the person in front of you rotates off, do not accelerate. New riders are especially guilty of this, and it’s typically not intentional. When you pull through, you’ve had the longest rest in the group, you’re feeling strong, and you don’t want to look like the weak rider. The best way to ensure a steady change is to stay in the same gear and keep an eye on your cadence (or use speed). This should become habit, but the first few times you focus on it you may be amazed at your tendency to speed up when you pull through. In a team time trial, the surge will only hurt your teammates and break the rhythm. In a breakaway with opponents, you’re only doing more work than others and should be saving that energy for one big surge to get away later. Don’t waste it while they’re drafting you. Example: I was recently riding with a guy new on our team. I was riding at 300 watts, and when he pulled through I was doing 420w just to hold on his wheel, but after about 15 seconds I could return to 300w and cruise right by him. The bottom line is that surging like this tends to slow the group down, despite the momentary increase in speed.

* Start accelerating before you’re at the back. You just pulled off and you’re tired; the last thing you want is to miss the tail end of the group and chase back through the wind. You should know how many riders are in your paceline and count them as you drift back. Shift to a higher gear with one or two riders to go and return to the group’s speed to get on the back of the line.

**Double Paceline:** A double paceline is just two single pacelines side-by-side. Riders pull off to the outside (beware or traffic on training rides as this makes the group four-abreast). This tends to form in larger groups when a rider would spend a long time rotating to the back after pulling in a single paceline. The same basics apply to this formation, and you’ll save a little more energy than a single paceline because of being shielded from the side.

**Rotating Paceline:** A rotating paceline can be one of the most efficient formations as long as all members are working together. Communication is really important, especially when you are establishing the pattern of the group. A rotating paceline is essentially a double paceline where one side is going faster than the other side. Ride to the front in the fast lane, and when you get there move into the slower lane (a call of “clear” from the rider you are going in front of is helpful). You shouldn’t brake or coast, just ease up a little bit. Don’t show off by taking a longer pull; doing so only exposes the slow lane to the wind and ruins the power savings for the rider that should be behind you. When you get to the back of the slow lane, accelerate and get back in the fast lane. The acceleration is easier than in a single paceline because there are two people, side-by-side, protecting you from the wind. This formation tends to work better with medium sized groups (6-12), but can work in smaller or larger groups with good communication.

**Echelons:** Echelons occur when there is a crosswind, and can make the race extremely tactical. We’ll discuss crosswind tactics at some point in this thread, but for today let’s just focus on working together. Since the wind is coming from the side, riders line up diagonally across the road to find the most protected area from the wind. Wheels will overlap, and riding in this formation requires good bike handling skills, good communication, and trust for the riders around you. As a reference point, I typically get my brake hood as close to the rider’s hip in front of me as I think is safe. This depends on strength of the wind and how much I trust the rider in front of me.

If the wind is from the right, the first rider will be on the right side of the road, and the line will go diagonally to the left (be safe and use your judgment when training). When the first rider is done with their pull they will drop straight back, ride behind the echelon, and rejoin on the back left side. The acceleration is harder since you will need to go around the last rider and move forward.

* * * * * 

OK, this was a long post, but I hope it helps some of the beginners here in learning how to work with other riders efficiently and conserve some energy. Next week I will post about how these skills can be applied to riding in a large peloton. After that, we’ll start getting to the fun stuff like attacking out of the group and, hopefully, winning!

We've had a few comments about race spoilers in the titles of posts. Our community is made up of people from all over the globe, this means races are shown at times inconvenient for many. Often the only way to watch a race is to record it and watch it later. People should be able to browse their Reddit front page without having races spoiled, so the moderation team has thought about this and we have made a decision:

###No spoilers in post titles, instead, put [SPOILER] at the start of the title

That's it, there are no more rules. We suggest a title along the following lines:

*[SPOILER] Tour de France: Stage 1 2013 Results and Discussion*  
or  
*[SPOILER] Tour of Flanders 2013 Results and Discussion*

We hope this suits everyone, is easy to follow and make sense. If you have questions, please ask!

Hello again r/Velo!


So a few weeks ago I posted this:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/shh8w/tips_for_first_time_support_car_driver/


Having done the race now I thought I'd share what we learned in case you might be thinking about volunteering yourself. There's also some tips for riders with support cars farther down.


a) Practice beforehand. I got my best friend (who's a cat 5) to ride next to my car while we practiced taking and handing out bottles on both sides of the car as well as fast wheel changes. Made for a lot less surprises at the actual race.


b) No ""Sticky/Turbo/Booster"" Bottles unless you're driving behind an elite race where the riders might know how to do that.


c) Turn off your music so you can hear the race radio. All hail the mighty race radio.


d) Do all your feeds on the right side of the car if possible. This puts you in between the rider and oncoming traffic. Plus your co-driver can lean out of the car if the rider doesn't want to get too close.


e) Open the wrappers on bars/gels/bananas before handing them to the rider. 


f) Put your blinkers on, and write what race you're following on the windows and windshield in grease marker. This way the riders know that you're part of the race and not some jerk trying to scare them.


g) When you stop to swap wheels, have a pre-determined strategy. For us, since I'm a mechanic and my gf is new to cycling, I'd go to the bike and get the wheel off while she grabbed a new wheel from the back of the car and brought it to me. I'd put the new wheel on while she'd put the old one back in the car and then get back in. I'd give the rider a push and then get in and get moving again.


h) Ask the organizer or an official if it's ok to let riders draft off you at this event. For Quabbin the dropped riders from earlier races could draft but the ones for the race we were following couldn't.


i) Give the dispatcher updates on your location from time to time. It makes it easier for them to keep the EMTs nearby.


j) 9 times out of ten, when a breakaway goes, you stay with the pack. If you don't know what to do, stay with the pack.


h) Avoid passing dropped riders on descents. If you have to (like if you're stuck behind dropped riders and the pack is getting away), give them as wide a berth as possible. Best place to pass is on a straightaway either on a climb or the flats. Don't be afraid to go down the left side of the road if you have to (and if you can do so safely)


And here's some tips for racers at an event where there's a wheel car:


a) Quick release lever goes on the left side. Also, make sure it points straight down, back, or straight towards the center of the rear triangle. For front skewers don't put them flush with the fork leg. That way the wheel car can get you back on the road much faster.


PS: Don't over-tighten your skewer. That slows things down.


b) If you need a  rear wheel, shift into your little ring and smallest cog before stopping. This also speeds up the process.


c) Do not lean on the side mirror of the support cars. It will abruptly fold back and you might fall. If you need to hold on to the car, use the windowsill, the ""B Pillar"", or the roofline. Practice leaning on the car with a friend you trust.


d) Don't get pissed at the person changing your wheel or fixing your bike on the side of the road. They're doing the best they can and cussing them out won't get you moving again any faster.


e) Check your bike before the race. If you aren't a competent mechanic, get one to do it for you. I know this sounds like common sense but most of the mechanicals I saw in this race at least were things that were completely avoidable like messed up limit screws.


d) If you want to draft off the car, ask first. They'll probably know whether you're allowed to at that race, plus you don't want to draft of a nervous driver.


e) When you've been dropped, stay to the right when possible. The car needs to be close to the pack to be helpful. If you're in the middle of the lane it makes it much much harder for the car to safely get back to the pack. Especially if the yellow line rule is in effect.


f) If you have been dropped and the support car is beeping his horn at you, it's because the car needs to get past you and you're blocking them. You've been dropped and their job is to support the people who haven't been dropped yet. Please be magnanimous and let them by. Or at least try not to get pissed at them or anything.

g) Lastly, after the race, say thank you. The support car people are giving up their day to ride/race so they can drive to the race wishing they could be on their bike, sit in a car driving fairly slowly (for a car) for a few hours wishing they were on their bike, and then drive back home wishing they could be on their bike, usually without getting paid. In all likelihood they woke up earlier than you did and will have to stick around until well after the race. Saying thank you really means a lot.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,True,,,True,t3_t1ne9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/t1ne9/things_i_learned_as_a_first_time_support_car/,

1361894180.0,39,self.Velo,199i5n,Tactics Series Entry 2.5 - Pack Riding,like2ridebikes,39,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/199i5n/tactics_series_entry_25_pack_riding/,"Hi everyone! Today I’m making a follow up post to last week’s post on saving energy in [pacelines.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18tjl4/tactics_series_entry_2_pacelines/) Like last week, this post is going to focus on conserving energy in a group, and won’t cover attacking. I know this stuff isn’t exciting, but you can have the best strategy in the world, but without the legs to execute it your move will go nowhere. This is important for conserving energy so you have the most energy possible to commit to your attacks.

**PACK SHAPE:** 

**Wide -** When the pace is slower, the pack fills the entire width of the road. Since the pace is slow, there are many riders who are willing to be at the very front.

**Narrow -** When things speed up, the riders who were formally willing to be in the wind start looking for a wheel. The faster the race gets, the fewer people there are willing to feel the wind, and at the highest speeds the pack will evolve into a giant paceline. Often we see a long paceline on the front with a “V” shaped pack attached to the back. At a certain point, someone has decided that they’re willing to sacrifice some draft because they’re just not willing to go any further back. [Note that in professional races the pack will be spread across the entire road at the highest speeds as they set up their leadouts for the finish. This is an exception to this generalization; we’ll definitely talk about leadouts here. This happens a lot less frequently in amateur racing.]

**POSITIONING:** Ask anyone for advice on any race, and the first thing out of their mouth will be, “Stay at the front.” That sounds great, but if there are 50 people in a race, all of whom want to be ‘at the front,’ some of them will be left at the back. There are certain advantages of being near the front – better cornering, lower risk of crashing, visibility of race tactics, pack splits, ‘grace room’ during surges – but if everyone is trying to be at the front then you will need to evaluate if it’s worth battling for position at a non-critical time of the race. 

When the race is approaching a section that can split the field (i.e. crosswinds, dirt, hills) it is important to be near the front. If the pace gets high and the pack takes on a narrow shape, all it takes is one person who can’t hold the wheel in front of them, and all of a sudden you’re in the second group and may need to bridge to the main pack. This is a huge waste of energy. Many times you may not even realize that the pack is splitting, especially if you are suffering and not focusing so far ahead.

**MOVING UP:** The race is coming up on a critical moment, and you’ve found yourself near the back, what to do? **The earlier you start looking for a chance to move up, the lower your chances of expending a lot of energy.** When the pace is slow, the pack often takes up the entire width of the road, and even though you’re not working hard and have plenty of energy, there simply isn’t a path forward. Try to get to one side of the road, and you will have to wait for a path to open up. Luckily, as the race approaches a critical point it will speed up and lanes will open, but you’ll need to work harder because of the speed. As the pace increases look for someone else who has decided to move up and jump on their wheel. Don’t swerve and take someone out; there are ways to force a spot open without being dangerous. Practice on training rides with people you know. If you have to move up on your own, try to do it in a tailwind section. **The worst situation is to move up in a headwind on your own.** You’ll probably burn so much energy that you’ll go straight back at the next surge.

Another great time to move up is when the pace slows down, but you need to be attentive and do it *immediately.* The pack will go from narrow to wide, shutting down passing lanes, but when a surge lets up most people are happy for the break and start coasting, leaving the lanes open for a few seconds. Keep working for just an extra 10 seconds and you can make it right up to the front.

Of course it’s ideal to be near the front all the time, but if people are scrambling to get to the front at a time you think is non-critical, you need to evaluate if it’s worth the effort. Sometimes it really is better just to sit in the middle. **Times you should be near the front: climbs, technical corners, and crosswinds. We’ll talk about these situations in future threads.**

**CORNERING:**OK, I’m not going to talk about cornering technique; there are a lot of resources out there and it takes practice more than anything. [Here’s one.]( http://www.cyclingtips.com.au/2009/10/cornering-tips/) What I will say is this: get good at it. I don’t care if you’re a ‘climber,’ and you don’t do many crits; this can only help you. Bad cornering will burn you in crits and road races with technical finishes. Good cornering can save you a lot of energy in crits, and bad cornering can make you go from the front of the pack to tailgunning in a single lap. You will be amazed at how tight of a corner you can take while still pedaling and not clip a pedal. If you have a normal 2-lane road and 90-degree corner, you should be able to pedal through the corner as long as it’s not downhill or tailwind going in. It’s a good idea because using your Zone 6 has a much higher physiological cost per energy than Zone 1 or 2. If you can take three or four easy pedal strokes through a corner that could save one really hard pedal stroke on the way out. Do 30 laps of a six-corner course and that adds up.

Eventually I will make a whole post dedicated to crits, but I want to emphasize their importance for road racers. Many amateur stage races have a road race one day and then a crit and TT the other day. You may not be gunning for a good crit placing, but with good cornering and strategy you can save a lot of energy that you can use in the TT.

Stopped by Speedway to pick up a nutritious breakfast of 2 cream filled donuts and a monster coffee energy drink. Wasn't feeling too fast this morning, and my bottom bracket was making all kinds of lovely popping and grinding sounds. Almost didn't race. Stood there for about half an hour waiting for the junior women to finish so we could do some warmup laps. Started feeling pretty good as I pre-rode the course. Got to the line and could have had a front row position, but I opted for row 2. Didn't want to work at all. 

After the normal spiel of rules, we were off. I wanted to stay towards the back due to my fear of my bottom bracket going out. Each lap, we accelerated hard after the only hard turn on the course. I was ready for it each lap. For some reason, once the downhill leveled off, the guys in the front would drastically slow, which caused several close calls. One junior locked up his rear wheel and almost took someone out. The hill repeats I've been doing must really be paying off, because the short climb didn't phase me. I easily could have overtaken most of the pack on the hill, but opted to stay in the back. I continued drafting with minimal exertion for a while. Kept forgetting to look at the lap counter, so I had no idea how much longer we had. I just kept my head down and stayed on whatever wheel was closest. I finally looked down once as we were on the back climb and my timer on my computer said something like 26 minutes. My heart started racing. Could it be! Were we about to hit the final lap?! Was I actually going to finish the race with the pack!? I couldn't believe it! I had tons of energy to spare and decided I was going to give it my all. As we crossed and the bell rang, it finally became a race. I heard my mom and daughter screaming to cheer me on, which really gave me a boost. Everyone dropped the hammer. I stayed on a wheel in about 15th until we came to the hill. I made my move too soon and got spent. I thought for sure I would get dropped and finish last. I grabbed a wheel around 10th and managed to catch my breath. The finish line was in site. The final lap had averaged about 28 mph, and now it was time to sprint. I didn't think I'd have anything left, but I gave it everything I got and passed about 4 riders. I think I finished around 6th. Won't know for sure until results are posted, but from my estimate, I was right around 6th...maybe 7th or 8th. As soon as I crossed the line, a wave of emotion hit me. I teared up. I couldn't believe it! Not only did I just finish my first criterium, I finished with the pack, and in the top 10! I had the dumbest grin on my face and tears in my eyes as I took a cool down lap. 

Everything I've learned over my 1 year of racing finally meshed. I stayed on a wheel almost the whole race, stayed in the drops, powered through the one corner to avoid the accordion, shifted at the right times, braked at the right times....it just went great. I really think that if I hadn't made that mistake on the back hill on the final lap, I could have won. Maybe next time.

[I added a new domain: www.bikevideoarchive.com.  The old one still works too but this one is easier to remember.]

If you want to check it out, here's the link http://californiacyclingracing.blogspot.com/

The URL has California in it but I collected videos from all over the world.  You can sort the videos by label (aka tag) or search by race name.

Also if you want me to post your video on the site or just a video you found, message me the Youtube link and the following information: Year/Location/Race Name/Highlight or Full Race Video/Category/Race Type (E.G. Criterium or Time Trial).   I hope to create a website where people can find amateur bike racing videos easier and with more information than sifting through Youtube.  

Also if you notice that one of the videos could use a label that I missed, comment below the video on my site and I'll fix it.  I'd appreciate the help!

I’m creating a bi-weekly tactics thread here. I have a few ideas about where to go with this, but I also want your suggestions so that it can be as helpful as possible. Here are some ideas:

* Generic tactics: road races, criteriums, hill climbs, time trials, stage races

* Upcoming races for /r/Velo members, i.e. *I have a big road race next month, how should I approach it?*

* Upcoming and past professional races, i.e. *How will Andy Schleck make up all the time he lost in the TT?* or *Why do riders even bother with a breakaway?*

* Pro racing vs amateur racing

A little about me: I’m a cat 2 and this will be my fourth year racing. I’ve won a few races (mostly road races and hill climbs), but I’m no expert and am still learning a lot myself. I will definitely be looking to the comments for people to chime in with advice that I may not be able to offer. I want to learn, too!

I’m looking forward to some good discussions this spring and summer. Feel free to PM me with requests or just post them in the comments. I'm hoping to post every other Tuesday.

Most people here are probably lower levels since racing is a pyramid scheme; however, there must also be some experience in here too. Here are the threads I have in mind. 

* Motivation thread - something similar to the 'what will you accomplish this weekend' thread. No real expertise needed, just a good attitude. 
* Coaching thread (or training) - a thread to bounce ideas off someone with more experience than you and get ideas for training and preparing for racing. Can talk power, equipment, course profiles, etc. 
* Tactics thread - Analyze courses, teammates, competitors, race reports (seeking constructive criticism), Would be cool to have some hard details too, links to race fliers, results sheets, historic TT/HC times. Talk of your strengths and weaknesses. A place where you can get help mentally preparing for your next race.

Some lessons, video and thoughts.",blandjoe,31,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1fml95/first_cat5_win_some_lessons_video_and_thoughts/,"I am still really stoked for my first win in a crit over the weekend. I’ve come a long way [since my first race earlier this year](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/19leg1/my_first_crit_crashed_out_heres_what_i_learned/), and I’ve put in for the Cat4 upgrade. I lived by this /r/ for the last few months. The links and discussion really helped me get better. So, thank you.

[This is the finish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=VDFb79qenaI#t=612s). It should play from 10:15 and I’m in the blue top coming up the left. I feel like my move might be considered dangerous (too close on the inside?), but maybe you can tell me if I should feel guilty or not. I held the line and didn’t cut anyone off, but I get very worried that I might offend people while racing. I think I care more about that than placing in a race.

Anyway, there is a lot on this sub, but I want to share a few things I’ve learned that really helped me and might help another beginning rider. 

1. Definitely attack at some point. The first time I ever attacked I got a small gap but quickly redlined into uselessness and I finished last. I was really hesitant to have a go again. [My attack this weekend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=plOk60MQgIk#t=933s) didn’t stick, but it did affect the race. The course had a small, 5% grade hill. With half the race to go, I went up with the peloton and then powered up and over the top. I held a 9 second gap with another rider for ¾ of a lap, but we didn’t really have the juice to extend it and make it stick so early in the race. We got brought back, but had time to recover. The guy I broke with eventually came in second place. So the break didn’t work, but we gained some insight on the course -- where it was difficult solo, how it felt to charge toward the lap line, things you don’t get a feel for in the peloton. It got our bodies ready for that kind of push, which came in handy at the end of the race. It also had a psychological effect -- people thought we were toast when we got caught, but I slowly crept my way back to the front after recovering, and I think that made people think about what I might be thinking. It’s also a boost to know that you can get a gap, if you want it bad enough. If you fail, you learned something and you will be better next time, guaranteed. 

2. Read your opponents. I spent a lot of time looking at people this race. Trying to see what their bodies were saying, if they start bending forward more (tired? About to make a run for it?), moving their legs faster, trying to see if their physical state showed in their face, little things that can tell you a lot about where a person is at and what they are planning. I oddly found this to be kinda, calming in some way.

3. Conserving energy is not just about staying in the peloton. Practice different seat positions that will use different leg muscles. In that break, I learned I could get a jump on people if I got out of the saddle and pushed hard over the top. I was thinking this would either be my move, or someone else’s toward the end, so I wanted to make sure I had those muscles ready. The last 3 laps, I sat up, handled the bars near the stem, and sat as far back on my seat as I could and climbed that way, gearing as needed to stay with the front ten. I ended up needing those legs as we charged up the hill later and made a long sprint for the finish.

That's it from this race. Right now, I’m still working hard to get top three in a proper road race. It’s been a struggle with those races. Doing a lot of strength intervals, 3x15m to get there before the season is over.

I decided to enter my first race at Mallory Park race course in Leicestershire UK. It was a cat 4/3 race - 30 laps of the 1.2mile course. I managed to stay with the peloton throughout the race, and didn't get dropped. I accidentally got to the front a few times and that was real hard work. Also one guy bumped into me but I managed to keep my line. I think I finished about 15th from the back with 52 riders.

I hate to blow my own trumpet but I'm so impressed and proud of myself for even completing the race let alone not getting dropped. Average speed of about 23mph, distance 38 miles (including two warm up laps). 30 laps of race track got pretty boring after a while although a lot of hard work and it was horrible anticipating the sprints and the slight climbs each time round. 

[Here's a video](http://youtu.be/ftnQ6hnE7hw) my girlfriend took of one of the corners which was pretty terrifying - it got so close, and everyone sprinted out of it. 

A can of coke never tasted so good when I finished.

Apologies for lack of structure to my post my mind is still catching up with me!

1360620570.0,27,self.Velo,18c2p0,"Training Series, Entry 2:  The basics of the Plan.",imsowitty,35,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18c2p0/training_series_entry_2_the_basics_of_the_plan/,"So here is my interpretation of the standard cycling training plan.  It is not new; most books offer variations on the same thing.  What i've done is to try to condense it into an understandable forum post, rather than a 100+ page book.

**Every ride should be broken into intervals.  Every interval should be as intense as you can continuously sustain for the given time period.  As the season progresses from the beginning to end, intervals should get progressively shorter (and therefore more intense).**

That's it.  There's no magic, no special tricks.  Devote as much time as possible to training (as opposed to riding), and follow the plan.

Ok, so let's now get specific.  We will break the season up into 7 main periods.  Base1, Base2, Base3, Build 1, Build 2, Peak/Race, and Rest.  With the exception of the last two, there is no clear distinction between periods, just a steady progression.

Base1: (ALL Z2 ALL THE TIME!!)Start with as many hours as possible in zone 2.  20 hours/week or more is preferable, and 15ish is sort of a minimum for this plan to work.  This is not easy.  You should be exhausted at the end of a long ride, but exhausted because you did 4 hard hours at a constant pace, not because you blasted up the hills.  If you go on standard group rides, you'll get dropped anytime the pace picks up, but you'll drop them when they all slow down to talk or be lazy.

Base 2: (Z2/Z3)  Keep the Z2 stuff up on your longer days, but on shorter days, work in some Z3 stuff.   Work some   2(or 3)x30 at or 1x60 into your week.  On your long weekend ride, see keep it well under Z4, but do as much Z2 and Z3 as you can.

Base 3:  (Z3/Z4)  Start working one or 2 Z4 workouts in per week.   Options include 1x15, 2x20, or 3x10. Do Z2 the other days of the week and try not to go so crazy over the weekend that you're tired when you get back.  

Build 1:  Z4.  3 (or more)  LT workouts per week plus one ridiculous group ride. (destroy/get destroyed by your friends)

Build 2: (more Z4/less Z5) Work in 1 or 2 Z5 workouts (3x5, 4x4, 5x3, etc.) while keeping the Z4 going strong.  Group rides should start to feel like long races.

Build 3: (less Z4, more Z5):  Just what it sounds like.  Continue the progression.  You're only working on top end here, so count on 1 fun group ride or race per week to keep your endurance on the radar.

Peak/Race.  This is personal, but I prefer to do 2 weeks of intense Z5 with lots of rest in between.  On the race week I'll take it easy and just do some hours of recovery.  Some people like openers.  I don't.  YMMV.

Some things to keep in mind:  You obviously can't do this for every race.  Pick the most important race of the season, set it as your ""race"", and work backwards to build your training plan.  As a Cat 3, I did this and won 2 major (to me) races on back to back weekends.  If you have an important race relatively early in the season, take a week of rest and start over at Build 1 (or 2, whatever you have time for).
Each period should last about a month, but this means 3 weeks on and 1 week of easy rest.  As the season progresses you'll notice that you have much less interval time (3x5 is only 15 minutes of actual hard riding).  The rest of your riding hours that week should be spent in recovery.  You can't ride too easy during this period, since you really should be wasted from the harder intervals. 


This post got super long and I haven't said nearly enough yet.   I skipped the 'why' and just talked about (some of) the 'how.'  If you want to know why this plan works so well, feel free to ask.  If enough people care, I'll throw it into a different post.  Otherwise, I'll ask any questions you'd like and I'll get more specific in the next post.

Credentials:  I started cycling seriously at 25.  Upgraded from Cat 5-Cat 1 in 5 years.  I spent 1 complete season as a 3, but upgraded once/season otherwise.  All of my points came from wins or podiums in RR's and stage races.  All of my good race results came from small group or solo breakaways.  I was decent at TT's, but hated crits and any RR that finished in a pack sprint.  I stopped racing last year to finish my PhD in physics, and now I work a full time job that doesn't permit the sort of hours necessary to race against 1s and Pro's.  I'm not interested in being mediocre at racing, so I now ride for fun and enjoy sharing what I've learned on the internet.

Disclaimer:  You should read The Cyclists Training Bible, by Joe Friel.  Every training book I've read follows the same basic guidelines, this book just happens to lay it out most effectively.  Everything I'll have to say here is a combination of what I've read in this book, what I've picked up by critically reading stuff online, and the experiences of myself and my teammates.  If you think I""m ripping off Friel, I probably am, but he wasn't the first or the only person to have published what I'll be referring to as 'the plan.'  His book also has a lot of what (in my opinion) is just filler designed to kill time and fill pages.  No matter how effective, you can't sell a training plan if it's only a few pages long.  Also, if you have 1 hr of intervals to do on a particular day, but need to do a 2 hour ride, you need to fill the rest with something.  The solution to both of these is the filler that doesn't really make you faster on the bike:  Spin ups, cadence drills, one legged pedaling, all of these sound more interesting than ""ride around for an hour but don't go too hard,"" which is really what they accomplish.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_18c2p0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18c2p0/training_series_entry_2_the_basics_of_the_plan/,

Starting from the beginning, I got to the venue a little later than I would have liked and had a slight issue at registration but luckily, it worked out. After registering and whatnot I warmed up for maybe 15 minutes or so (a little less than I would have liked, but I'll make sure to leave earlier the next time) with /u/SneakyKiwiz. Then the time came to line up at the start, I wasn't incredibly nervous and I was just trying to remember all the tips you guys had given me. Once the whistle blew I clipped in an next thing I know I'm in the middle of the group doing about 27 mph. The first corner wasn't bad and I held my line through it and didn't get yelled at so that was good but I definitely got a feel of the accordion effect. So it continued pretty steadily like that, continuously jockeying for positions and whatnot, all the while I just kept remembering what you guys were saying, if you're not moving up, you're moving back. So I had worked my way towards the front 1/4 of the pack around the 10th or 11th (out of 15) lap and my lungs were burning but I felt good, a little too good. I decided it would be a good idea to stick up with this breakaway attempt that was forming near the only hill on the course. I was carrying a too much speed to tuck in behind one of the members of the attempted breakaway so I continued along beside them without anyone to draft off of, big mistake. When we crested the hill and started down the other side, I was spent. I moved onto the outside of the course and let the peloton pass me. I hopped on the end for a bit but it didn't last long thanks to the accordion effect and my earlier than expected fatigue so I ended up getting dropped off the back with about 4 or so laps to go. I kept on riding, not wanting to drop out (at the time I didn't realize the rules stated that you can sit out a lap but then jump back in) and it ended up one other person got dropped too so I wasn't alone so we rode 2 laps together then the peloton lapped us and we got pulled out with one lap (for the peloton) to go. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely do it again next week and hopefully hang on a bit longer!

1359750368.0,27,self.Velo,17pplq,"Training Series, Entry 1: Nomenclature.",imsowitty,32,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/17pplq/training_series_entry_1_nomenclature/,"I am starting a series of posts related to training.  So that we're all on the same page on what we're talking about, here is a list of terms.  Not much advice quite yet, just a framework for us to discuss fitness training in the future.  

First let's talk about training zones.  First I'll give a name, and a time interval associated with that intensity.  If you can hold a particular intensity for longer than the max time, your zones are low and you need to increase them.  Percentages are all given in terms of LT power.  You don't need a power meter to play along, however if you can afford it, a power meter (and the correct training plan to go with it) is the best money you can spend in cycling, outside of a simple bike and healthy food.  You use roughly the same percentages for HR or rate of perceived exertion (RPE)

Zone 1: Recovery (0-50%)(all day):  The hard part about Z1 is forcing yourself to ride easy enough in it.  It's very common to creep up into Z2, and then you aren't accomplishing your goal of active recovery.  If you are too tired because you haven't fully recovered or you rode too hard on your easy day, then you won't be strong enough to hit the right numbers later when it gets hard.

Zone 2: Base.(50-75%)(all day)  The biggest misconception about base is that it should be easy.  It shouldn't.  Base rides are very long; and at the end of a 4 hour day, you should be exhausted.  The only difference between base and other types of training is that the intensity is kept as constant as possible.  Instead of the ups and downs of a standard group ride or race, you ride at 75% of your LT the entire time.  This means going super easy up hills and pedaling down them.  You should be getting dropped by groups whenever they go hard, but you should be dropping them when they stop to chat afterwards.

Most people just use base as an excuse to ride easy in the early season.  There is a time for riding easy, but it isn't during base rides.  Also, most people don't have the time required to devote to properly training base.  If you can't throw at least 15 or more hours per week into training, base should be swapped out for endurance and LT work.

Zone 3:  Endurance(75-85%) ~~(30 mins - 1 hour)~~ (1-4 hours, I disagree but this is the standard) This is the point where you first start to notice pain.  Endurance intervals aren't as intense as LT ones, but they seem to hurt just about as much.

Zone 4: LT(86-105%) ~~(10-30 mins)~~(15mins-1 hour);  Lactate Threshold.  Also called anaerobic threshold (AT), functional threshold power (FTP), and Carmaichel might call it CP30 or something.  All of these are slightly different in terms of their definition, and what is going on in your body

LT is the holy grail of cycling.  Of course other things are important, but if you can have 1 thing in cycling, it's a high LT.  LT is the point where the lactic acid produced by your muscles is just barely capable of being cleared out be the rest of your system.  It's what you can steadily sustain for 20-30 minutes.  It hurts.  A lot.  The end of a LT interval leave you gasping and drooling and both physically and mentally exhausted.  Note that all of the other zones are based as percentages of LT.  If your LT goes up, the power at which you can recover goes up, so at a certain speed in the race while others are working a little, you are recovering.  Similarly, when others are dipping into their V02MAX reserves during a surge or hard effort, if you can hold the same speed but stay in your LT zone, you can ride for twice as long as they can before giving out.  Everything done in terms of fitness training is about raising your power produced at LT.

Zone 5: V02Max(106-140%) (15 mins - 1 min)  This is the power associated with a surge or an attack in a race.  It's not an all-out sprint, but it hurts, and you'll need to dip below LT for some time after the effort is over.  VO2 max training is important for 2 reasons:

1.  Surges tend to be when people get dropped in races.  Attacks are how you get away.  You can have LT for days, but if you don't have enough V02Max to get away, then you'll just finish in the pack.  This happens to triathletes in road races ALL THE TIME.  They can drag the pack along all day, but they can't get away or sprint, so they finish 20th or whatever.

2.  Training V02MAX intervals can increase your LT.   I was hesitant to believe this because I don't like the short, searing pain of these intervals compared to the longer, slightly duller pain of LT intervals.  The year I got serious about V02MAX intervals corresponded to a sizeable jump in both V02Max power and LT power.

Zone 6+:(150%+) (0-1 min.)  Anaerobic/Sprint.  What it sounds like.  If you get to the end of a race and you aren't alone, you're going to have to sprint.  Sprint power has little to do with breathing and LT and lots to do with muscle strength.  Track sprinters care about this and almost nothing else, which is why they tend to have huge legs compared to road cyclists, and the majority of their training isn't even on the bike, it's weight training and plyometric stuff.  I'm a horrible sprinter and won't be giving much advice on how to sprint in groups larger than 5.  I'm sure a pure pack sprinter can give you all the advice you need if you're willing to ask.

Intervals:  An interval is simply a stretch of time where you're doing a single effort.  It doesn't have to mean 2 minutes of pain.  It could be a 20 minute LT interval, or a 30 second rest interval.

Intensity:  Intensity refers to how hard you are riding.

Volume:   Volume refers to the duration of your ride.  Most people will measure volume in hours, not miles.  You can tell a newbie to training, because they'll tell you how many miles they rode last week.  A 20+ hour week is impressive.  A 500 mile week (as some bike shop kid claimed to me recently) means you're lying.  Anyone who can actually train 500 mile weeks is measuring their volume in hours.

2x20, 3x10, 4x5x8 etc.  This nomenclature refers to the number &amp;amp; duration of intervals in a given workout.  The first number is the number of intervals done.  The second one is the time duration in minutes.  The third number is often omitted, but represents the rest between intervals in that set.  If I go out and do 3x10's that means I'm riding for 10 minutes, resting, and repeating for a total of 3 intervals.  5x2x2 means 5 intervals, 2 minutes long, with 2 minutes of rest in between.

Power/weight.  (measured in watts/kilo) is a popular metric people on the internet use to compare against each other.  It's often called the eWang, and there's an eWang chart that says which category you should be in based on your W/kg for different time periods.  There a lots of ways to cheat and lie about this number, but if you are honest with yourself, it's a great way to track progress and take into account weight loss or gain when gaining or losing power.  The value commonly accepted as the maximum human capacity at LT is 6 W/kg.  This is the number guys like Schleck, Contador, and Cuddles are capable of in recent years.  Lance (and most of his team) regularly did 7 back in the day....

1367412832.0,25,self.Velo,1dh7yy,Race report: First all-women's crit,girlieq3,30,5,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1dh7yy/race_report_first_allwomens_crit/,"Novel ahead.

It was my fourth race ever. Not a big deal, just the weekly training series. Here's the thing - usually I race with the men. We don't have a huge number of women in the area, so there's 2 or 3 or 4 of us there in any given week. Not really enough for our own race, so we just race with the slower of the two men's groups. 

Last week we raced with the men. First race of the year. There were 3 women - two very good, nation-champion types - and me. That's fine. I hung on to the men's group for half the race before getting dropped, then finished the race on my own. It's not a big deal to get dropped from the men's race because they're generally faster anyways. The other two women placed in the top 5. I was actually pretty proud of myself. I used to pansy out if I fell back a little on the corners and was off the pack in no time. This time when my lines sucked and I ended up 20 feet off the back, I fought to get back on, and did successfully for a good portion of the race. 

So this week, it took a ton of advertising but we got together enough women to run our own race. There were about 12 or 14 of us. Quite a few out for their first race who were too scared to race the men. Figured I'd have a good chance, right? 

So the race starts off. It's super windy. I hang out in the front 1/3rd - but not right at the front, because I don't want to do all the work, but I've made the mistake of hanging out at the back and getting dropped every corner too many times. I'm drafting perfectly, it feels like there's no wind, and all the girls in front are doing the hard work. My cornering is much better than last week. I can tell some of the girls have never raced because they're swerving all over the road - I just about got my wheel taken out a few times. 

Most of the race goes flawlessly. My positioning is right to deal with the wind, I'm drafting right, my corners are right. The girls I recognize that are here are fast and I'm right beside them. When it comes down to the sprint they'll kick my ass, but I don't care as long as I finish in the pack. They put up the sign - 3 laps to go. 

Two laps to go. To this point the pack has been pretty tight - it's not overly competitive. There are girls here that could take off and destroy everyone if they wanted to. 

But then my mistake - the 4 girls from the same team at the front put out an attack with a lap and a half to go. Right into the wind. I'm right behind them (and I should note - the only women on my team so I have no one to work with). But I waited too long. The stupid thing is.. I saw them getting ready. I could tell from their body language that they were preparing to take off. But I waited too god damn long - they were 10 or 15 feet ahead of me when I decided to get way too cocky and think I could catch up with them. I went for it, but I was in no-mans-land by myself and the wind was too much. I JUST got on the pack - and my legs died. I couldn't do it. RIGHT to the back and 50 feet behind. Literally LAST. The worst part is - they got caught anyways. If I had have just stayed with the rest of the pack, even though I would have been pulling, I would have ended up right back where I was, not wasted my energy, and been in a fine position to end the race. Instead, I'm in last. 

By some miracle I managed the JUST about get back on the group with a ton of hard work. The group was speeding up and girls were getting dropped left and right. The stronger girls had already taken off off the front and it was a pretty spread out group. I passed 3 or 4 that got dropped, but I never really got back to a solid spot. I ended up finishing way behind - around 8th out of 12. 

This was the first time I raced where the competition was actually fair, instead of racing the men. And I had a god damn chance at placing well instead of riding half the race on my own. Instead I made a stupid mistake and DESTROYED my race. I am NOT happy about this. It's so stupid. One stupid moment of hesitation, and ultimately a bad decision, cost me my first chance to actually place. Considering I race with the men and generally keep up for a good portion - this should have been easy. I should have had no problem against a bunch of girls that had never raced. But I ended up at the back of the pack, and for a bit - last. 

So mad at myself. 

**TL;DR** Did well in a race until 4 girls broke off the front and I tried to catch them on my own because I got cocky. Instead died from the sprint and finished poorly.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,1367413980.0,,ca,True,t3_1dh7yy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1dh7yy/race_report_first_allwomens_crit/,
1364177440.0,25,self.Velo,1ay6vh,"[Race Report] My first crit - hung on, but lots to learn",guttertech,28,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1ay6vh/race_report_my_first_crit_hung_on_but_lots_to/,"I raced this morning for the first time after lots of deliberation. I'm 29 years old and began riding seriously about a year and a half ago. I've wanted to give racing a try but always worried that my fitness wouldn't be there and that I'd get dropped pretty quickly. Once I found myself hanging with some faster guys on group rides, I figured that I might as well go for it. I went in with two goals: don't get dropped and don't crash.

I picked this race in particular because the course looked pretty newbie-friendly. It's a wide course - there are two 90-degree left turns and then a long gradual curve to bring you back to the line. I got to the race early this morning, warmed up (20 minutes, maybe not long enough?), and waited to start.

The pace was a little easier than I expected. I've been doing some practice crits and hard group rides lately that killed me by comparison. That's not to say the race was *easy* (otherwise I would have had a better result), just that I had the fitness to hang.

Once I realized that I probably had the fitness to finish with the pack, I deluded myself into thinking I might be able to be competitive. I started to think about position and worked myself into the front third. I eventually made some mistakes. First, during a prime lap, I found myself at the front even though I didn't intend to contest it. It took me a while to realize that everyone was going to sit on my wheel for as long as I'd let them (or until I blew up). I think I burned some matches, especially when I backed off the pace to let some riders pass and got blocked out of some wheels. I had to fight to gain position all over again.

During the last few laps, I found myself in what I thought was a good spot, but the rider in front of me looked like he couldn't hang on while the front of the pack upped the pace. I had to go around and sprint to catch up. Definitely wore myself out enough that I couldn't quite respond during the last half lap. I ended up finishing 12th out of 20 riders.

I've got the bug and am looking forward to racing again in a couple weeks. I think that I've got some work to do in terms of tactical awareness and sprint power (probably more the former). I'm pumped that I was able to meet both of my goals this time around.

How long is the learning curve? I suppose it's probably different for everyone, but I'm curious how long it took more experienced racers to feel competitive.

Lots of great advice on here - it definitely helped me have a good race (by my standards) today!",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_1ay6vh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1ay6vh/race_report_my_first_crit_hung_on_but_lots_to/,

Granted, some of them were due to weather, which makes crashes harder to avoid. It made me think about how I race and how I avoid crashes. I'm going to list some thing I try and do, please feel free to expand the list and make it so everyone can be safer.

1. **Protect your front wheel at all times.**
If you always look out for your front wheel then you can get out of most bad situations. The only place I would ever overlap is if there are two cyclists in front of me to either side so it is impossible for them to come over and hit my wheel.
2. **Look ahead**
Don't stare at the person in front of you. Look 3-5 maybe more people ahead of you. It's easier to see how to pack is moving and you'll be able to anticipate surges/slow downs better. 
3. **Hold your line**
Pretty self explanatory, but it still needs to be said. Practice cornering if you have to.
4. **Be predictable**
Don't make sudden movements. It is possible to put out a lot of power and be smooth at the same time.
5. **Know when to back off**
Be aggressive, but knowing when to back off can help avoid crashes. If you're in a crit don't try moving up in the last lap, or in a corner by cutting people off. Move up earlier, get in a good position. 

That's basically what I can think of now. I've been in plenty of races with sketchy riders, but if keep the things I listed in mind I think the risk of crashing is much less.

[Tyler Farrar](http://www.slipstreamsports.com/garmin-slipstream-pro-team/tyler-farrar) will be there throwing down, spinning the legs out in preparation for the Tour of California next week. I'm kinda interested to see what happens.

It looks like we have a 15-lap scratch, a points race, and some other not very fun looking race. Any ideas for how I should handle this? He's a sprinter, so I was thinking of just attacking in the middle of the points race after everyone bolts for an early sprint lap. Perhaps a breakaway could stay away for the rest of the race. I'm not sure.

All I know is this is going to be pretty fun.

UPDATE: I ended up 5th or 6th on the night out of 35 or so. Tyler beat everybody in all three races. I went off the front with 9 to go in the 15 lap scratch race and forced Tyler to chase me. It took him 4 laps to reel me back in. In my opinion, that's a WIN for this amateur trackie. Went up against him in a small field sprint and finished just a bike length or two behind.

1362526375.0,25,self.Velo,19qml5,Training Series Entry 3 - Leadouts,like2ridebikes,26,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/19qml5/training_series_entry_3_leadouts/,"Today I’m going to write about leadouts. Leadouts are one of the most basic tactics in principle, but one of the most difficult to execute properly. Although typically thought of as a sprint tactic, various forms of the leadout can be used any time you want to deliver your team leader to the crux of the race in the best possible position.

TV commentators almost always describe a leadout as, ‘delivering your sprinter to the line,’ but that is really vague and doesn’t really explain how it works. The two functions of a leadout that increase your team’s chances of winning are:

* Giving your team leader a head start

* Putting a large percentage of opponents out of contention

In order for this tactic to work you need to have a group of riders who are able to ride at the very front and also be willing to sacrifice their result completely. Ditch your Mark Renshaw illusions of coasting across the line in second place with your arms up celebrating your teammate’s win. Think about all the hours you spend at work each week; those guys are out practicing their leadouts. You squeeze in an hour each week with your teammates to practice this. They are professionals, and exceptionally good at what they do. If you do a leadout properly, you will probably finish at the very back of the pack.

In an amateur race, you may only have one person who can help you; that’s OK. The riders need to have similar fitness levels because they need to ride on the front fast enough such that no other riders can ride ahead of them. Typically in lower categories, the differences in fitness levels are so great that your helper is either not strong enough to help you effectively or they are stronger than you and should be the team leader themselves. Chances are that you won’t have a line of 6 guys on the front with 3km to go. In amateur races, your best bet is to have one or two domestiques and try to use other riders to start your leadout.

**So, how does a leadout put riders out of contention?**

Remember last week we talked about pack shape. When the race gets fast, fewer riders are willing to ride at the front and the pack gets long and narrow. By putting a rider on the front going as hard as he can it will string out the pack into a long paceline. This rider will have zero chance of winning the race, but he has to commit to this high pace until his job is over. Let’s say that there are ten riders capable of winning the sprint, all hovering near the front. As your teammate increases the pace and the pack narrows, some of them will not get a good spot in the line, and are forced either to burn their energy in the wind to stay near the front, or they take a bad spot in line. It’s a catch-22 for them, because if they stay at the front they won’t have any energy for the actual sprint, and if they stay back in the draft they won’t be able to make up such a great distance in the final. Now, instead of 10 people who could possibly win the race, there are three. 

Assuming you have four riders (one leader, two leadouts, one other),here’s how this would go. Your ‘other’ [sorry, couldn’t think of a good term] will make sure that your team is near the front with about 5km to go. He won’t ride the front, but if people start moving up he’ll go into the wind briefly to match those moves and keep you out of the wind. You don’t want your team to get boxed in, so this rider’s job is basically to keep your team in a position where you can take the front when you need to. Your first leadout rider takes the front with 1500m to go and just goes as hard as he possibly can until 500m to go (about 90 seconds). He needs to commit to this, 500m to go is his finish line and he sprints like it is. This pace should also serve to discourage any attacks.

**The head start.**

Now you’re at 500m to go and there is one leadout rider in front of you. His finish line is 200m to go. If he doesn’t go fast enough, another leadout could come up alongside him and eliminate your advantage. We see this happening at the end of pro races where the pack is wide even though the speed is high. All the leadout trains are trying to establish themselves as the front so they are lined up next to each other. In the lower categories (4/5) this is probably not a concern because there won’t be many people working together. If you are going fast enough then you should have the front of the pack strung out in a single paceline, and here’s where the head start comes in. When you begin your sprint, you don’t need to be the fastest sprinter to win! You already have at least a one-bike-length lead on everyone else.

**Other uses of a leadout.**

TV commentators really only use the term ‘leadout’ when talking about a sprint, but you can apply this to other parts of a race. Starting a big climb at the back of the pack is a huge disadvantage. You could be starting the climb 100m behind the leaders and need to work your way around dropped riders. By using a few of your teammates to increase the pace before the base of a climb you may catch a few of the good climbers in bad position. You can do this before dirt road sections, technical corners, descents, or any time you want to ensure that you are in a good position.

This can all sound easy in theory, but it takes a lot of practice to do it well. If you start too early your riders will fade and you’ll be left to sprint way too early. If you start too late then other teams may come around you and box you in before you even have a chance to start. Try to practice with your friends and teammates so you can figure out what communication you want to use and if there’s a good order for you to work in. 

**Looking for help here:** I’m not a sprinter, so I’d love to hear what the good sprinters have to say about this. Was there anything I was way off about or you think I should have included? Thanks!

Mr. Johnson,

I would like to express my displeasure with USA Cycling and UCI'c enforcement of your rule 1.2.019(the registered Pro team fine for racing unsanctioned event fine). I have raced mountain and road bikes for over 10 years. I have bought day licenses many times as our local sanctioned series has been on the verge of bankruptcy for years and one of the poorest run businesses I have ever seen. Races start late, awards take hours to process and it takes months of work to repair trails after they have decided to run a mountain bike race on the 3rd straight day of rain. Our local shop team has spent it's money and time on local trail development and youth rider development, the only times we ever hear of USA Cycling or UCI is went they are fining someone. Last night at our year race layout meeting it was again brought up that you are now fining Pro Team members that are racing non sanctioned events, this letter is to inform you that me nor any of our team will race any USA Cycling event on a one day licence or a year license. We are also sending letters of support to ALL local and national promoters that are not converting to USA Cycling. 

This enforcement does not just hurt the Pro that comes to an event, it hurts the trails that the local groups use race money to support and the kids and young adults that local teams like ours fund and educated. We all know with better pro turn out comes better racing and it also brings out a bigger crowd. However USA Cycling does not help our local trails and our local youth development our local promoters do. They run a better race anyway.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_15u3yj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/15u3yj/usa_cycling_letter/,

Race report, and a question: I know the bike doesn't matter, but does the bike matter?",aaronkz,24,1,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1ebmq4/first_race_ever_yesterday_race_report_and_a/,"I tested the Cat 5 waters yesterday on a 6 lap race of a 2 mile circuit. It was great! Simultaneously humbling and encouraging. 

I'm not really a cyclist, this was just an impulse idea when I saw how low the barriers to entry are. I've probably biked a grand total of about 50 miles for recreation this year, tack on another 50 for ambling around town when it's so nice out I can't morally justify driving.

Anyhow, the race went well. I sucked wheel for most of the race, staying near the front. Felt super comfortable in the pack and with cornering, which was what I was most nervous about pre-race. I took my turn in the wind at the start of the last lap. Whoops. I dropped back into the pack to recover for a few seconds before the sprint and was able to climb back up to a 6th place finish, of about 10 in the pack and another 10 off the back.

So [this is the bike I did this on](http://i.imgur.com/jyj6Hl0.jpg) (EDIT: I did have clipless pedals though). Don't worry, I took the pouch and lights off. And while I did kind of expect it, it was still pretty intimidating when virtually every other bike out there was a dedicated race bike. The majority of even the other cat 5s had carbon bikes, and a bunch even had carbon wheels. My wheels are deep V's with extra beefy spokes that I built up when I weighed 280.

I'm thinking about renting a low end race bike for next week. Do you guys think it would make a difference or should I stick with my 30lb monster that fits perfectly?

EDIT: Thank you all so much! There's an incredible amount of great advice in here and it's all come from such a small community. Plus not one person made me feel unwelcome as a beginner or called me a fag. I like you, /r/velo.

This week has been crazy with studying and taking all my finals for the semester. Yesterday, I went out to take my cycling final (i made that up) in Northern Utah. The Cat 3-4 race was just over 60 miles with about 3200 feet of climbing, all of it was right at the beginning and then a five mile climb at the end.

There were about 75 guys who signed up for the race, but, because of the weather, only 55 showed up. The race started on the same 5 mile climb that we would finish on. We slowly went over it, and it took me the whole climb just to move to the front. As we got up to the top, hail started to come down. I moved to the front and led the descent so that I wouldn't be in any danger. It was tough to even look up with the stinging ice coming down. Eventually we got low enough and it turned in to rain. Not much better because it started pouring down. Within 20 minutes of starting the race, we were completely drenched.

After the descent, we turned around and went right back over the hill, through the rain and hail. Right near the top, the grade picked up pretty steep and so I made a little move, just to check out how strong the field was. I noticed two things. One, my legs felt like jello from the cold. Two, the whole field stayed and seemed very strong. We got over the top of the climb and out of the rain and hail only to descend into the wind and the cold.

The next forty miles I spent mostly sitting in. There were a couple solo attacks, but the big teams worked together and brought them back. It was basically just a flat out and back. The pace was fast and the wind was very strong, but nothing unbearable. The toughest part was trying to get my legs warm and feeling better from the cold. I did a couple pulls, just to try and warm up and get my legs going a bit.

About a mile before the last climb up to the finish, I made my way to the front. I'm guessing there were about 35 of us as we got to it. We got to the first little pitch and the attacks and accelerations started. The first one hurt, and I dropped back about 15 positions. I kept wondering when any of these guys were going to pop. The grade leveled off and so did the pace for a minute. I recovered as best I could and as we hit the next one I made my way back to the front. I was about 8th wheel and we were about halfway up.

A couple of teams starting forming in the front to lead out their guys and bring back any solo attacks that went off. I hovered behind them and stayed with the accelerations. At this point guys starting popping. We were probably a mile out from the finish and the grade started to pick up again. Another solo attack went and got a pretty good gap. The only guy with a teammate left in our group put his guy in the front to close it down. The teammate popped after closing most of the gap down, probably about 500 meters or so from the line. The hail started coming down again, stinging our already hurting bodies.

The guy who had his teammate bury himself launched first and early. At that point I was sitting 4th or 5th wheel. He bridged the gap quickly and moved on, going hard. I stood up and went, going around the other side. We were side by side, about 75 meters from the line, maybe 5 guys on our wheel. I picked it up and kicked as hard as I could, putting a small gap on everyone. I held it to the top and managed to hold it all the way to the line for the win.

The bad weather makes this one so much more satisfying. This race was also the first real race in Utah of the season but I'm pleased that I can throw down with the 3's and 4's. I just got my upgrade approved yesterday so now ill be racing as a 3.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_1d5q3y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1d5q3y/race_report_echo_canyon_rr_cat_34/,

1375908176.0,20,self.Velo,1jwq1x,"2013 Bryan Park Circuit Race, Cat 4/5 and Cat 3/4",rvlvrlvr,21,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1jwq1x/2013_bryan_park_circuit_race_cat_45_and_cat_34/,"These two races were run back-to-back, Cat 4/5 first then the Cat 3/4, with a 15 minute break between. Though there is a weekly training race on Tuesdays in Bryan Park in Richmond, VA, this was my first time racing here since I live two hours north and getting down to Richmond during rush hour along I-95 would be impossible. The pavement was pretty rough, about as rough as [BikeJam](http://youtu.be/JnkLBnnJpJg) in Patterson Park, Baltimore, MD (i.e. ""cheese grater"" surface - great for traction, but so help you if you were to go down at speed), but the course was pretty non-technical and non-selective, with two left-turns and no real climbs.

I had given my legs a good thrashing the day before at the 53-mile Cat 4 Page Valley Road Race, and I had dug a pretty deep hole earlier in the week before that by doing a time trial the previous Saturday, and then missing the start to a group ride on Sunday and basically hammering all alone for 50 miles trying to catch them (and not getting good rest during the week and then joining in on a couple hammerfests didn't help either). So I didn't have many expectations for the Bryan Park races, and indeed I hadn't even planned on racing them at all until a teammate said he was considering them earlier in the week...and then decided not to race *after* I registered. So I was racing without teammates to help -- but I did have friends on other teams in the same fields, and so at least I wouldn't be alone and might even be able to form an alliance. Warm-up was fairly *blah*, just spinning on a trainer in Z1-Z2 heartrate (and maybe 80% FTP) for half an hour, with a few minutes at FTP thrown in (which barely bumped my heartrate into Z3), and then a lap of the course.

In the Cat 4/5 race it became VERY apparent that I was racing with Cat 5s - many riders seemed to have a lot of trouble clipping in, and I was able to jump out front and slot-in at second wheel for half a lap before the peloton finally gets organized and some riders join us lead riders. Cornering, especially on the one 'sharp' turn, left a lot to be desired (including myself, though I did better as the laps wore on). Several laps in we have a slow-down caused by a slight rise (I did say there weren't any real climbs - I meant there wasn't anything that we'd need to go in the red for), and of course the peloton bunches up...and we have our first crash of the day which although it was just in front of me, I managed to avoid. One lap later, a rider seemingly flips himself out of the peloton and into the grass for no reason (looking back at the video, he seems to have crossed his own front wheel and overcorrected). The rest of the laps were pretty uneventful, though I did note a few riders who I thought were pretty sketchy and did my best to stay away from them.

On the final sprint, I started from wayyy too far back, but managed to pick off a lot of riders and take 4th place. Being a Cat 4 in a mixed 4/5 field (and likely with 20+ Cat 4s), this means that I should get 2 points towards my upgrade. I had 16 points going into the race, and so 2 points gets me to 18 and will help make my case for upgrading (along with the pack finishes and top 10s that I've accrued over the past couple seasons).

The Cat 3/4 race was faster and longer, but also much smoother. Initially I was feeling that I might not be able to make it to the end having tired myself out a little in the 4/5 race, but since this race was smoother there were fewer surges and I didn't find myself caught up in the accordion effect too often. At one point, a 4 man break popped off the front and I was able to jump into the chase, and then bridge across when the chase stalled. However, I wanted to latch on and become dead weight to the break to shut them down, since I was still a little unsure about being able to finish well and I wasn't really interested in working that hard anyways. I followed a few more attacks, but ultimately the group stayed together and it came down to a group sprint at the end. Again, I started from wayyy too far back, but this time the leaders were stronger and too far ahead to catch and I was only able to pick off seven or so riders to take 13th.

So I had fun, stayed upright, got some results, and cemented my decision to apply for the upgrade to Cat 3 after this weekend (even though I don't quite have the points).

I had my helmet-cam mounted, so I was able to take videos of both races. I also chopped them up into highlights videos, and even found some music that I thought would be appropriate (and to try the whole race/music-video thing).

Thanks also to the people in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/xsxoq/hey_rvelo_most_road_race_seasons_are_winding_down/) everyone's advice was extremely helpful!

I worked this morning, 11am-3pm.  Rode my bike home and sat around until 4ish when I left to my LBS where I was going to talk to the guys and have my fit checked out a little more.  After I got done with that I rode to where our Crits are held.  

The course is a short 1km loop with two sharp turns and 2 not-sharp-at-all-turns.  The home straight had a nasty head wind today, I don't just mean a baby head wind... This was making small trees move around.  I wasn't too pumped for that, but hey the race goes on!  I arrived around 5:40, did my registration dealio, and talked to some guys on my LBS's race team.  We warmed up together and then got to the line.

I had myself position in the middle of the line at the front in the field of 15-25 riders.  The ref say go, and we're off.  All our turning was to the right btw... we enter the first not-so-sharp-turn and I'm position around 10th.  On the backstretch we have a crazy tail wind at our backs and a lot of people got out of the saddle to try and move up.  Everything is going smoothly until we enter turn 3.......... it's a sharp turn.

The peloton enters the turn no more than 2 wide and I'm sitting between 10-15.... All of a sudden I see a duck just waddling across the road.  He's approach from the inside of the turn and he's about 20m ahead of me.  He gets to the outside of the road where us riders are swinging to from exiting the turn and he, the duck, is right in front of two riders, both of which I'm behind...  The duck seriously could not have given less fucks.  The two riders both have slam on their brakes (skid marks were made) to avoid nailing the duck and I'm thinking to myself ""Are you fucking kidding me.... first race, first lap, and I'm going to crash... all because of a retarded duck.""

I quickly ease on the brakes and appropriate amount to try and avoid hitting the riders and to avoid getting rear-ended.  Everyone makes it through the turn without crashing.  I think to myself ""Fuck yes, I lived"" but I quickly realize that this duck has fucked everyone outside of the top 10.  The duck caused the peloton to cut in two and there was literally nothing we could do to get back to the top 10 riders (It also doesn't help that the strongest riders in the race were all in the top 10).  We enter turn 4 and the head wind begins to destroy group 2, we are out of formation because of the duck, and behind now by quite a margin.  We get organized once more about 1/2 through the front stretch and head wind.  I sit towards the back of group two getting a feel for the speed and trying to take in everything that is going on around me.

After a few laps sitting towards the back of the group, I decide I want to be towards the front of it and exiting turn 3 (where the duck fucked us). I decide to put in some effort and swing up.

This was a very bad idea... The 2 riders I had been sitting behind were clearly more experienced and stronger than I, should've never tried to over take them.  Also... I shouldn't have tried this coming off of turn 3 and into turn 4, because this is where the head wind started.  

I **think** this is what ended up happening... but I can't be sure... a little gap formed between me and the rider whose wheel I wanted to get onto and the head wind proved too much for me.  I lost the group two and took a few riders with me T__T.  After one lap of me leading this small group the rider behind me signaled to grab his back wheel when he took off to catch group 2.  I jumped slightly too late and got crushed again by the head wind trying to keep his back wheel.  Now all I could do was suffer as I was in no mans land.  I pushed as hard as I could being alone and after 4 laps of me being alone the leaders caught me.  

The cat 2 rider who I've been taking to a lot at the LBS told me when this happened to get up and sprint to insert myself into the group.  That's what I did.  I hung with them for 2 laps and it was so much easier than being alone, It was nuts.  I was thinking to myself ""Awesome, I have people again for the rest of the race.""  At the end of my 2nd lap with them a rider 3 people in front of me made a hand single to the rider behind him and attack at the finish line into the head wind.  The rest of the riders took off... again I was too slow to respond and got stranded... Luckly I only had 3 more laps to go and did my best to keep pushing as hard as I could.  The race was over.

I didn't stop moving after I crossed the line.  I kept riding (thanks for the advice velo! :D), and after two laps stopped with the rest of the racers at the finish line and talked for a bit.  

All in all it was a good experience.  Didn't crash, didn't get pulled, didn't get last, booyah.  I had done a lot of riding during the day and my ride to get to the crit area was longer than every other rider.  My actually riding time before the race started was an hour and a half... I don't know if that has anything to do with my performance but I'm sure it doesn't.  I'm going to have to ride that much every time I go anyway so might as well get used to it... haha.

I think I can safely say I'm addicted,  I missed the feeling of racing so much.  I'll give a little bio of myself if anyone wants it! 

Here's a short one: runner for 5 years HS and collegiate, quit running July 2011 (tired of injuries), was stagnant until June this year and I'm looking to get fit again and put my aerobic prowess to work!

1367243378.0,20,self.Velo,1dc56s,Race Report: First Cat 5 Crit,smithtys,21,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1dc56s/race_report_first_cat_5_crit/,"I know /r/Velo just couldn't wait to have another Cat 5 race report, so I'm here to deliver.

Spoiler alert: It ends as you expect it to.

So this season a local bike shop and brewery decide they want to enter the team sponsorship fray. For reasons wholly unknown to me (other than I spend too much money at both places) they ask me to join the team. I sign up and then find out they've decided to launch a brand-new crit in our downtown as part of a local heritage festival. No problem, I think. Sure, the tales of Cat 5 crits on /r/Velo and videos of said crits on YouTube are enough to strike fear into anyone, but I owe it to my sponsors to be in this race and support their cause. Suck it up.

We get lined up and right away my teammate and I are in a bad spot (no fault of our own; the way they lined us up was screwy, and then they only let us use half of the road to start). We're in the last quarter of a 50 person field and immediately upon starting the field splits and we're not in the split. 

We spend 2-3 laps (don't remember exactly) moving up by surfing wheels before a guy we know is getting back in after a mechanical. Having ridden with this guy a few times in the past I know he's going to kill himself to get back to the lead group and that's exactly what he does, and I get a free ride back on the process. My teammate (who, BTW, is riding on a CX bike with CX gearing) catches up about a half lap later. We've both used more energy than we'd have liked to at this point, but we're top 15 now, in the lead group and feeling ok. 8 laps to go.

As the laps tick away, the lead group starts yo-yoing a bit. Some of the less experienced riders are braking a lot in corners and the guys on the front are coasting through, causing us to have to jump more than we'd like at times to stay on (we were at the back). With about 3 laps to go friends of ours who were watching the race (who are more experienced racers) start shouting at us to move up. Teammate and I discuss and decide to sit in and save energy (major mistake). We figure we can let the other guys do the work, pass the less experienced folks with 1 lap to go, and then have a decent finish (we weren't going to win, but we could maybe do top 5, certainly top 10).

2 laps to go and friends are emphatic that we need to move up. We do jump up a few spots and are now somewhere around 10-12 in the lead group. But it's starting to string out, so we're probably 15 bike lengths from the front. Pace picks up a bit but nothing major.

Just as we approach the Start/Finish for the last lap we make our move. I get on my teammates wheel and we move up several spots - probably 8/9 or thereabouts, and we're continuing to move up. Problem is everyone else decides they want to move up, too, and things start to get sketchy. Hit the first corner and we're carrying some speed (90-degree right turn) and it's a short straight into a 90-degree left-hander. Problem is the straight is 4 lanes wide and it slams down to 1 lane for the left. I'm out of position (more in the middle of the road than I'd like) but no biggie - I can handle the turn from here, I just can't carry as much speed as I want out of it. Hit the left and a guy on my right panics - doesn't hold his line, hammers his brakes, and starts forcing me into the curb. I start yelling ""Inside! Inside! Inside!"" which he seemed to take as some sort of instruction for him to deviate even further from his line. I laid my bike over as far as I could and hoped for the best, but it wasn't to be...lost the rear wheel and down I went (thankfully I didn't take anyone else out and, due to being the the break, I was out of the road before the riders behind were affected). Some pretty bad road rash and the bike needs a new tire and some new bar tape, but could have been a lot worse.

Definitely bummed because I actually felt ok during the race and wasn't as terrified as I'd expected. My teammate ended up finishing 12th as he lost a couple of places looking around for me after the crash and then couldn't do much to wind up his sprint with a 46T big chainring. But it was his first crit, too, so a good result all things considered.

Lessons learned:

1. There's no truer adage than, ""If you're not moving up you're moving back."" You don't have to be consciously moving up places the entire time, but if you're not flowing toward the front somehow you're dead. There's no such thing as staying ""static"" in a crit because the constant yo-yoing will have you chasing all day.

2. You don't need your brakes as much as you think you do. Get off the gas a bit sooner, countersteer, weight your outside pedal, apex, and then get back on the gas. A lot faster than pedalpedalpedalBRAKEBRAKEBRAKEpedalpedalpedal and your legs will thank you for it.

3. Be in the top 1/3 of whatever group you're in. At the end, I should've worked to be in 5th or 6th in my group rather than being content with being in the top 1/3 of the field as a whole.

4. Don't wait until the last lap to move up. Get in the position you want to be in with at least a couple of laps to go.

5. Crashing sucks, but it's not as terrifying as you think it is. It happens so fast that you don't really notice it until you get in the shower.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,usmi,True,t3_1dc56s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1dc56s/race_report_first_cat_5_crit/,

So I have my first race ever coming up in just over a month. I am 25 and rode recreationally starting two years ago. I'm around 5 foot 7 and 135lbs (I dont know if this information is usefull). This past summer I decided that 2013 would be my year to start racing. During the past summers rides with my club I would ride with my clubs 2nd fastest group and try my best to take my pulls on the front and continue to hang with the pack. Other times I would ride with my clubs fastest group and just try to hang with them instead of taking too many pulls. I didn't have a HR monitor or computer at this time, so I don't really have any way of numerically guaging my skill from these rides.

This past winter I've been riding a trainer indoors a few times a week and seeing a trainer once a month or so. I have ordered The Cyclists Training Bible from my local Chapters but its been about a week and it hasn't come in yet. Most of my training from October to December was just long efforts in zone 2/3 (HR). From January until now my training has been intervals, but since im still pretty unsure of what I should be doing I usually do an hour ride of 12mins intervals in zone 5 with 4mins of rest in between. 

I will be racing either in a ""Begginer"" category or in the lowest ranked category in Ontario Category 4. Last years speeds of the races I will be racing were between the 33-41km/hr average range and it has me quite worried as I don't know if this will be too fast for me. Can you guys give me any advice on testing my race readiness? I've never competed in any type of racing sport before and I feel like not finishing would be very discouraging and fear putting myself into a situation where I am unlikely to be competitive. 

Thanks for any help you can give!

For the HRM part, Motorola discontinued their Motoactv product, and as a result the ANT+ HR straps are for sale on Amazon for $35.  These are made in the same Chinese factory as Garmin, Zephyr, Wahoo, and many other straps.  Having owned 4 different HRMs from this factory including the Garmin unit, I have reason to believe these are the exact same unit as the Garmin but with a different plastic shroud.

At the start of last season, I went on an early-season club ride. It was mainly enthusiasts, not many racers, though some of the guys were pretty quick. The rides usually turned competitive up front. Well, I had just started road racing, so I felt like I was a hotshot on this club ride, even though I was just a Cat 5 at the time. I'd been keeping my fitness up doing some intervals on the trainer through the winter, so I figured I could thrash this group ride. I remember putting in a dig early on, and only a few guys were able to hang with me. One guy was wearing raggedy bibs and a wife beater. We got to a big climb that I figured I would win on. Wrong. Wife beater guy dropped everyone by A LOT and soloed away.

I think I have fairly strong leg muscles from a weightlifting point of view (I think last winter I could pistol squat 80 pounds), but I can't sprint at all/have no acceleration. When I sprint/accelerate, I sort of feel like I'm not getting much power to the pedals and feel a bit uncoordinated. 

I know the answer to get better is to practice, but I'm wondering if there's common mistakes, or any other tips for sprinting.

* I race solo - no teammates. Before every race starts, I introduce myself to 4-5 people and memorize their names. During the race, I make a point to say hi again and call them by their name. This makes me a friend, and later if I really need it I can ask them for some help, and 99% of the time they will help
* To make space for myself, I'll pedal and flair my knee out on a few revolutions. Totally safe, but a lot of guys will back out and open up space subconsciously. This lets me move over. I sincerely doubt this will work past the 3s.

I'm a (potentially former) collegiate runner with bone/joint alignment problems which create muscular imbalances that limit any significant mileage/intensity/training. I am giving running one last shot, but I doubt it will work out. I've been in physical therapy, etc. for 16+ months and I'm looking to commit to something that is far less likely to injure me.

I have the build of a cyclist and a strong aerobic ""engine."" I have access to resources to get a good bike and equipment, as well as connections to riders in a ""semi-pro"" training group in my area. I have several months of cycling experience already (as a form of cross training) and plenty of physiology and aerobic training knowledge. I follow some aspects of professional cycling, but I don't have in-depth knowledge.

Questions I have:

1. Anyone in this subreddit transition from running to cycling?

2. Volume. How many miles/hours do you cycle per week?

3. Workouts. Frequency? How do you measure your intensity? How do you measure the length of intervals? Do you do intervals? Hill repeats? Tempo sessions? Really long rides? Do you do a kind of warm up and warm down before workouts?

4. Periodization. Do you practice it in order to have the best race performances? If so, how do you go about it?

5. Supplemental Training. Resistance training? Dynamic flexibility work?

6. Winter/Inconsistent Weather. How do you train in the winter? If it rains regularly (once a week+) how do you ride everyday? Do you use stationary trainers or stationary bikes?

7. Any other relevant advice? I'm looking for some really detailed takes on training, especially workouts and the physiological principles behind them.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_onr40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/onr40/hardcoreprofessional_cyclists_explain_your/,

It was a clear day which was nice, since there was a chance of rain. I signed in and went to find a spot to warm up a bit. I really had no idea how to warm up, so just cruised around at a decent speed and practiced sprints a few times. 

The field was comprised of 17 riders and started on time. The first few laps were jittery for me, I was shaking so much it took me a bit get clipped in haha. There were a few early attempts at a breakaway that I stayed away from and the front guys caught them. After everyone got situated and the breaks  were under control the pace settled and so did my nerves.

The next few laps were uneventful, I began to feel more comfortable cornering and began to actually feel that I may be able to be competitive and not get dropped; which was my biggest fear as I'm not very confident to begin with. I started to think about all the things I had read on here and started moving up in the group. I was in second wheel for a while and then all of a sudden found myself pulling. I pulled for a few laps and when I looked back it seemed like the group was letting me go so I decided to push my luck and attack. I did a lap on my own and wasn't sure how much longer was left and second guessed myself and let myself get caught.

It turned out there was only 5 laps to go and I still felt really good. The next four laps were fairly uneventful and on the last lap I started moving up again, the race was pretty strung out at this point so I ended up beside the main pace line. On the second last corner another group came up beside me and I got really boxed in, and ultimately was unable to sprint as the front three guys took off and the rest just coasted in. 

I ended up finishing mid pack, and happy with the result for no other reason that I felt strong, it was just my poor tactical knowledge that led me to end up in a bad spot. 

I know it's hard to give advice without watching, but is there anything you guys can suggest to help? And I just wanted to thank this sub for all the previous advice and encouragement, not just to me but other beginners. Reading all the supportive posts to others gave me enough confidence to actually give racing a try! I can't wait for next season; I'm even more excited for training now haha.

I still ride, and am going to get back into racing again this year (already started training!). Ever since I started riding, I've been on an aluminum frame, and ever since I started riding, I've wanted a carbon frame.

My reasons for the desire and twofold:
1. The weight/performance advantages; a lighter frame means a lighter bike, and I also understand just how strong carbon can be which can help with power transfer/performance (however negligible it may be).
2. Carbon bikes just look so cool! It's something of vanity, but honestly, I feel as though having a higher end frame of the carbon variety can project an aura of seriousness about the sport.

I've avoided getting carbon because well, the frames can be quite pricey, and I don't exactly have money to throw around. The other reason is because I've always followed the motto ""don't race what you can't replace,"" and if something were to happen, I would be out of a frame.

Am I just lusting after carbon because I don't have it? Or should I take the plunge?",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,usil,True,t3_13cu3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/13cu3x/carbon_frames_worth_switching_to_from_aluminum/,

I had just moved back in with my parents after a tumultuous 3 years of living with my friends who were so embroiled within the Columbus drug scene that I was beginning to fear for my life, but that's another story. I had just started losing weight in an attempt to regain my grip on sanity and a healthy, normal life. With this in mind, I decided to take up bicycling to and from school. I had been riding with my mother who bicycles religiously and already knew I could travel entirely on bicycle paths from my house, twenty miles south to the university campus. I started this during the summer and loved it. I was so tired when I came home the first day I lay flat on my bike on the kitchen floor in an attempt to cool off against the tile. 

The next day I could barely walk. But I kept at it. It felt so good, the wind on my face, the trees rushing past, the smell of the beautiful mossy loamy patches of green surrounding ponds that seemed so haphazardly scattered about. That second day I didn't feel so bad when I got home. Then the next day I felt even better. I started timing myself to see how fast I could go. from an hour and a half to an hour fifteen. then down to 1 hour. I was getting faster and it felt so good to be like a normal person. The rush of accomplishment from achieving something, anything, after what seemed so dire a situation just months prior. I wanted more. On the weekends and breaks from school I would find century rides. 100 miles. My first one took 6 hours and I ended up riding with a firefighting father who told me all kinds of tips and tricks for how to pedal efficiently, how to not lose energy, and how to keep a pace. After a while and a few more centuries, someone suggested I race. I had never even considered it before. I eagerly looked up the website they spoke of and found a race was that weekend! 

The race was a ""criterium"" which I later learned was a short, technical course that you would ride within a certain time frame. for beginners, it was 45 minutes. I was so pumped. I washed my bike and bicycle clothes for the big day. My steel framed beauty would surely deliver me to the finish line ahead of everyone else. I was so sure I would win. I had ridden centuries, How could I fail? That night I slept the sleep of a man disturbed. no dreams came, only an excited and nervous smile kept vigil over a restless bed. The race began at 9 AM with the beginners, I arrived at 8 in order to register and warm up. 

I talked nervously to fellow racers who were in line at registration which turned out to be a plastic canopy covering an older woman at an equally plastic table. I could see the other racers glistening carbon fiber bikes by their side. I held my old 93' yellow schwinn road bike close, its bulky steel frame and tread worn tires left nothing to the imagination. I was given a piece of waxed paper with my number on it and some clothespins. I slowly circled the parking lot attempting to warm up, careful not to stray too far as I was afraid I would miss the start. When I saw other people starting to line up at the starting line I followed. We all stood anxiously as a race official in a blue polo shirt emblazoned with the logo ""USA Cycling Federation"" barked out the rules. I had read them a thousand times before hand and I silently mouthed the speech along with him. ""30 seconds!"" he yelled, and then moved to the side, whistle in his mouth, staring at his watch. 

The whistle screamed and the ""click-clacking"" of bicycle shoes clipping into their corresponding pedals surrounded me. We started off rather slowly, each turn was very deliberate. I knew the power of drafting and knew that I didn't want to be in the lead, but wanted to stay near the front just in case. After two slow laps a flash of color shot by on my left as someone was attempting to sprint ahead of the pack. The entire group of cyclists lurched forward and swallowed his attempt quickly. Then there was another, and another. Soon the pack wasn't picking them up so quickly. I realized I had to follow their lead. With one man up the road, just 100 yards ahead, I slipped out of the pack and charged forward. The difference between riding behind someone and riding into the wind was incredible. I stood on the pedals, caught up to and settled in behind the lead man. I glanced backwards and for a second I thought no one else would join us, but the thought faded as the group slowly but surely reeled us in, except now we were tired. panting for breath. Each gasp of air filled our lungs with cold. The two of us settled back into the protection of a large group and tried to catch our breath the best we could. In seeing our failed attempt, it seemed to deflate any would be attackers for the time being, and another few laps passed uneventfully. We were 25 minutes into the race and we started seeing lapped riders appear ahead of us. Old overweight men who decided to try it out on their commuter bikes were being given harsh reminders, as young men bolted past in a brazen attempt to show off their youth. I admit that I was one of them. Slowly but surely the group began to fade and it was down to 10 of us, each one trying to force the rest with the duty of staying up front, of breaking the wind. Each person who found themselves upfront seemed admonished that no one would help him, as if he had forgotten his own attitude just seconds prior. As we passed the start/finish line we saw the lap cards, 5 to go. One of our group who was more successful in shying from the front leapt forward and sprinted ahead, out of the saddle, legs pumping furiously in an attempt to catch us off guard. I was ready. 

I had thought about that tactic myself, and was preparing to do it with 3 laps to go, but seeing as I had to catch up with this joker, it seemed silly now. Most of the group caught up and the aggressive one was now relinquished to be the front man. We followed him for another lap before more attacks were sprung, I was having trouble keeping up with each of them, but we were so close to the finish. 2 laps to go. Another rider went for it and no one responded. The one slight uphill section of the course was the perfect place to attack such a weary group. I doggedly marked him only to find that no one else followed! It was him and I crossing the the line one last time, 1 lap to go. We careened past the cheering crowd as they blew whistles and rang their cowbells. 

We both knew that if we at least wanted to finish 2nd, we couldn't play games, we had to keep the gas on or be caught by the group. I took the lead. The road seemed endless when the wind was on you. It felt like cycling through mud. There was the uphill section that preceded two right hand turns before the finish. We were going to make it, but now who was going to win? I was still in the lead and we flew up the small hill and turned right. I thought ahead through gasps of air and knew I wanted the inside curve. I could feel him on my right, trying to get in between me and the curb. He wanted to box me out, make me turn wide while he raced home on the final stretch. I couldn't let that happen. I edged right and rode in the gutter, and he was forced to brake slightly and take to my left. I had the inside curve, the race was mine! 

The turn came up and I rubbed my brakes, slowing slightly for the 90 degree turn, all the while sensing him on my left. As I started the turn I could feel him inching up, not slowing, I thought ""the fool, he's not going to be able to make the turn!"" I was wrong. He did make the turn, but what I hadn't counted on was his turn interfering with mine. Going faster, he swung left and dove into the turn, edging past me slightly, and directly into the path I was traveling. my front tire hit his pedal and I faltered. for just a second I thought I could stay upright, but that thought was dashed as quickly as I was. my bike skidded out from underneath me and I came down, hard, on my right shoulder. I slid across the street and came to a stop on the opposite gutter, I jumped up to let out a string of expletives and cursed him to the heavens before sheepishly realizing I was standing inches from a 4 year old girl in a pink ""hello kitty"" dress while her father stood behind her desperately trying to cover her ears. As the rest of the group sprinted past to glory I remounted my bike and slowly crossed the finish line in tenth. I didn't even stop. I rode straight to my car, packed up my bicycle, and drove home. 

My mother anxiously waited in the kitchen and let out a cheer as I walked in. She smiled and asked ""How did it go!?"" I sat down at the table with a half full water bottle, still dirty, sweaty, and adorned in my bicycling gear. After a long drink I replied, ""It was great.""",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,usoh,True,t3_t8hpp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/t8hpp/i_wrote_out_the_story_of_my_first_race_thought_i/,

1331495603.0,15,self.Velo,qruid,"Yesterday's road race, Sequim 1",paddedroom,17,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/qruid/yesterdays_road_race_sequim_1/,"I CAST LEVEL 10 WALL OF TEXT!

""Where your team for the day isn't your team at all."" - (Quote goes to a teammate after he heard the story)

Sequim overall was way more fun than my Mason Lake run last weekend, and I'm a little angry at myself for not bringing the GoPro this time. There were more team mates in my group, the field was 48 deep instead of 27, and a few other teams brought out some big groups to play around with. Because it was my 2nd race, I had a few personal goals for the day: work on threading forward and back through the pack, work on spotting surges, and finish better than last week at Mason Lake. 

For the first lap I felt awesome - speed was great, cadence felt great, the small climbs were no problem, and I was able to maneuver my way over to the right or left side of the group where I could wheel up when people were braking needlessly. Sequim had a handful of 90 degree corners at road  junctions and most were staying within the confines of the painted lanes. To keep from hitting the brake shockwave, I was late-apexing corners and using as much of the paved inside as I could to make a better line. Every time I went for the dive I'd jump 5 to 10 people and slot myself up nicely - all very good.

The group kicked up in Lap 2. In a (seemingly solitary) moment of brilliance, I was on the outside when the leaders did some more of that unnecessary slowing and just by keeping my pace lept up from mid pack all the way to the front. My brain screamed both ""WTF are you doing?"" and ""OH HEY WE'RE IN FRONT!"" at the same time. Granted, I knew I didn't belong up here, but I was laughing on the inside because the leap came so easily. 

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction and this is where I started feeling the lack of base miles and endurance hit. My recoups weren't coming fast enough and (had I more experience) I wouldn't have pushed myself to hold the pace. Having found myself in the front, I SHOULD have used to time to reel the group back. So after being overtaken and winding up the 2nd of the climbs, I was left gassed for the main straight. *Flush* Out the back I went. 

Ever headstrong - I wasn't going to let it go without a fight. I caught a junior from JLVelo that was struggling and told him to latch on and rotate out, 5 second pulls. We quickly caught up to a Bikesale rider and I had him hop on, now I had 3 and we started rotating out, never spending too much time pulling and we caught up with a Motofish rider - up to 4. Hey lookee here, we almost have a decent paceline and BAM, another Bikesale rider and shortly after we soaked up a guy from House Wines as well. I was coaxing and prodding the group along, barking commands to make sure no one ever spent time up front, running in true tank-tread rotation, ""NO SPRINTS!... KEEP THE PACE!"". We weren't running anywhere near enough to catch the peloton, but we doing great as a group - brilliant really - for it being my race #2, race #1 for a couple of the others. I kept us chatty to keep our minds off the pain that I knew we were all feeling and we were calling each other by jersey since we didn't know each others names. ""House, did you bring enough wine for all of us today?"" ""C'mon Moto! Take the front. Good work, drop it back!""

This year Im coming back after a nasty injury during a race and an awful battle with autoimmune disease, and i'm fulltime in the throes of anatomy, physiology, cadavers and research.

basically, i want to be fit enough to do some short XC races and cross races to warm up my season. Anyone here have some advice short of hiring a coach and emailing my schedule/study plans?

what kind of interval work do i need to do? How much do i need to work in on one weekend day of volume?

I posted my old power figures, but basically, I can hold 300 watts for 15-20 minutes at my pre season peak. i'm probably down to 240-250 now. my estimated FTP was around 280-290 depending on how i was feeling (right before the illness battle)

what kind of things should I work on with a limit of about an hour and a half every other day...
should i even bother riding outside during the week or stick to the trainer sufferfests?

With the Tour de France just around the corner, it's time for us to open up our Velogames Fantasy Competition league!

For those that haven't played Velogames before, it's a similar concept to fantasy football. You pick your riders and they score points based on a bunch of different metrics. You may make unlimited changes to your team until the entry deadline of 12:15 CEST (Central European Summer Time) on Saturday 29th June 2013. Once the race starts, there are no transfers, so you won't be able to change your team again throughout the race. Your picks must include the following:

* 2 All-Rounders
* 2 Climbers
* 1 Sprinter
* 3 Domestiques
* 1 Wild Card

The rules and scoring system can be found [here](http://www.velogames.com/tour-de-france/2013/rules.php)

You can sign up here: [Velogames Fantasy Tour de France](http://www.velogames.com/tour-de-france/2013/index.php)

The /r/Velo league is: [20022120](http://www.velogames.com/tour-de-france/2013/leaguescores.php?league=20022120)

Last years standings looked like [this](http://www.velogames.com/tdf/leaguescores.php?league=26162854). We had 8 entries at the Tour last year (and 25 at the Giro this year) - so we should comfortably beat that this year.

* Organising ""club"" events that clearly only suit themselves. Rejecting club events put forward by anyone outside of their circle.
* Blaming incidents on riders that didn't do anything wrong.

However, this was done without help from my 3 teammates. As the team leader/sprinter, I expect some help now and then but I understand if they get dropped or have positioning issues. Unfortunately though, one of them is an insecure/egotistic sack of shit. Here's what happened this past weekend:


In the road race, I broke away off the front (solo) mostly unintentionally and gained a 1:30 minute gap on the field. I got caught after about 11 miles right before a steep hill where I got dropped because I didn't get enough time to recover in the pack. I later find out that my teammate had gone to the front while I was off the front and pushed the pace. He did this multiple times (despite other riders saying ""why the fuck is he chasing his own teammate?"") until another teammate yelled at him. Later in the evening he claimed that he had ""forgotten"" that I was off the front and tried to laugh it off. Interestingly, he had never gone to the front and chased any other breakaways. I may not have stayed away the entire race, but I would have gotten a head start on the steep hill if it were not for this incident, and could have sat in the pack and waited for the sprint at the end.


In the crit, one of my teammates crashed in a freak accident during warm up and skipped the race and another got dropped, leaving me with the shitty teammate. Despite him being able to move to the front on the narrow one lane road the day before and push the pace, he proved incapable in helping me chase down the breakaway of two riders from the same team. I couldn't get any help at the front, so I tried to bridge, brought the gap down from 15 to 6 seconds, but because no one else pulled through, we didn't catch them. I won the field sprint despite not getting any help in terms of positioning or a lead-out. Another teammate criticized his sudden lack of effort this race and he again just laughed it off with some bullshit excuse.


All in all, he is becoming more and more frustrating, and I kind of want to just punch him in the face, then upgrade so that I don't have to race with him anymore.

Thanks for all of your help r/velo",mike_burck,18,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/kjann/did_my_first_criterium_today_and_i_cant_wait_to/,"I posted a couple of questions on here the last few months asking for advice about group riding and looking for some good first race stories.  The advice you guys gave was extremely helpful, and I felt it help me during the race.

Here's my story:

The .7mile track was on a wide city streets, featuring two 90 degree turns and one long horseshoe turn; it was well paved, clean and flat. 

I got a good warm up in, and I found that the time on the trainer did as much for my mind as it did for my body.  I watched a little bit of the race before me, and it made me a little nervous.  The pace was fast, and seeing them power through the turns made me reconsider my decision to race (only for a moment).  Once I got on the trainer and focused on my warm-up plan, heart rate and liquid intake, my anxiety went way down.  

I couldn't have picked a better spot on the line to start.  I was front row, slightly to the outside of the first turn (about 60m ahead of the start line).  I was able to fall in to about the 8th spot for the first few laps.  I focused on finding the best line and keeping the right cadence for the first couple of laps.  

After about the 3rd lap, I looked down at my computer.  I was amazed to see how fast we were going.  I expected to see an average from 22-24mph, but we kept it at 25 or above for most of the race.  I hadn't expected such a quick pace, but it was surprisingly easy.  

I spent the next several laps ranging from 10th to 20th place.  There were some teams riding, and they often didn't let people fall in between their riders.  I found finding a wheel to be the biggest challenge.  The pack would fan out and regroup, and it took time for lines to get in order.  Overall, I was pleased with how well people communicated though.  For such a fast cat 5 race, it was a well disciplined group and nobody went down.  

At one point, I worked myself up to about 4th or 5th position.  By my estimation, we had about 10 minutes of racing left (our race was delayed and I didn't know the start time... like an idiot I forgot to reset my computer after the warm up laps).  I felt more comfortable at around 10th position, so I decided to try and move backwards in the pack.  I came out of line expecting to be able to fall back, just as the front of the pack decided to try and make a break.  The pack responded and I wasn't able to fall back in until the end of the pack.  Unfortunately, the guy I was behind let a gap form and I wasn't able to make the jump back up to the pack.  I ended up getting dropped.

It turned out that there wasn't 10 minutes to go, only 3 laps.  Had I known we were at 3 to go, I would have stayed in 5th position happily.  I feel that if I stayed there, I would have been able to respond to the attack and stay with the pack. That's what I get for ignoring the ""laps left"" sign.  

Even though I was dropped, I was extremely happy with my experience.  I proved to myself that I can hang with racers (at least in category 5).  With a little better strategy and discipline, I know I can finish (and eventually compete for a high placing).

I just joined my college's team, and I plan on riding a lot of collegian crits with them.  

Again, thanks for all of your help leading up to the race.  I had a ton of fun, and I look forward to possibly racing against some of you guys in the future.  ",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_kjann,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/kjann/did_my_first_criterium_today_and_i_cant_wait_to/,

Though he and I live on opposite ends of the coast, I *do* think using Reddit to find riding partners is an excellent idea.

Unfortunately, recent updates to Reddit prevent commenting on threads of a certain age, so we'll need to figure out a way to host our hypothetical riders list.

The two options that immediately come to mind are:

* Google docs- We create a shared Google doc with our state/region, preferred riding pace (&lt; 14mph, 14 - 17mph, 17mph+, etc.), preferred contact method, et al. From there individual riders within a region can email the group and propose rides.

* Monthly thread- Each month we create a new ""riding partners"" thread and pretty much do the same exact thing.

Any thoughts/feedback? 

**Edit**: It looks like the masses have spoken, and a monthly thread it is! 

Because of Reddit's new thread expiration policy -- users used to be able to vote/comment in threads indefinitely, but now can only comment or vote in a thread for a set period of time -- we'll need to create a fresh group ride thread every 4 weeks or so, so I'll plan on doing it on the first of each month.

Gotta be proud of my Canadian - albeit French Canadian brethren. The Garneau boys controlled the race from start to finish. They got two in the break and then shut everything down. I got into a few moves but they'd always get one guy into every chase group that would just sit on so nothing cohesive could form. Over the final stage road climb the attrition was huge, we were down to about 20 riders, primarily due to the pacesetting of Garneau again. Those boys can climb. Then they lead Langlois out for 4th place (3 from the break stayed away - two of them Garneau). I somehow sprinted well and took 6th overall. Happy with the result but I really wish I had got into that break. I did the Fondo the next day too (I ""won"" - treated it as a good training ride because I don't get these kinds of hills where I'm from). Overall we had a great time, and our team did very well.

Your body uses a chemical called ATP to make your muscles contract (as well as a whole bunch of other stuff).  At any given moment, your body only has enough ATP for about 8 seconds of effort, so you're constantly replenishing it*1.  While exercising, most ATP production comes from the breakdown of sugars.  The most efficient way to do this is to use oxygen in a process called aerobic respiration.  In this process, a single sugar molecule will get you about 36 ATP molecules.  Anaerobic respiration on the other hand, will only get you 4 ATP per sugar, and will produce lactic acid, which as we all know, hurts.  A lot.  Aerobic respiration is much more efficient, but it is limited by how much oxygen you can pull in, and how fast you can get it where it needs to go.  ATP production from anaerobic respiration is practically unlimited in the short term, but is unsustainable over time due to the lactic acid buildup.  At high intensities, production of lactic acid outpaces your body's ability to neutralize it.  In the very short term, we are limited by our muscles, the force they're capable of delivering to the pedals, and the speed at which they can spin.

As road cyclists (and in particular, those of us who dislike sprinting), we very rarely use more than our body weight, so our legs are plenty 'strong' in terms of how much force they have to deliver to the pedals *2.  What we're really working on when we train are the first 2 mechanisms: Aerobic and Anaerobic respiration.  It's a weird way of thinking of it, but at the end of the day, the strongest cyclist is simply the one who is the most efficient at turning food into forward motion.

As long as your body has stored sugar and oxygen, Aerobic respiration is superior.   You can get more work done with a limited supply of fuel, and it's relatively painless.  Anaerobic respiration is necessary for energy needed above what aerobic respiration can handle*3.

Ok, so there are two systems, maybe I've gotten too into describing it, but the TL;DR is.  **Aerobic respiration is good for sustained efforts below a certain intensity and Anaerobic respiration is necessary for high intensity efforts.**

Here's the part related to training though:  **Aerobic fitness takes longer to gain, and takes longer to fade than anaerobic fitness.  This is why we spend the bulk of the season on low intensity work, and why we do it first.  You are maxing out your capacity for aerobic gains before moving on to anaerobic workouts.**  This is more effective than training both simultaneously throughout the season.  Although LT work is essentially training both systems at the same time, the intensity required to get performance gains isn't sustainable over an entire year.  Having pure aerobic periods early, and mostly anaerobic periods later in the season allows you to partially isolate each system, and get faster as a whole.


*1.  Molecular biologists and physiologists will say I'm oversimplifying most if not all of this, but for the sake of our purposes, I think this is fair.  Feel free to clarify if it will contribute.

*2.  Track sprinting is almost a different sport in this sense.  Sprinters are much more focused on pure force strength than any sort of endurance.

*3 It isn't this simple.  Your body is always using both types of respiration, but as effort increases, the proportion of your ATP production coming from the anaerobic process will increase.  Once you are producing lactic acid faster than your body can get rid of it, you've crossed over your LT.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_18jdis,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18jdis/training_series_entry_25_why_the_plan_works/,

This ride sports the tagline: **""A fashionable training experience to be enjoyed with friends and lovers on the most romantic roads central Texas has to offer""** 

As such, my 4-man team spent much of our 6 hour journey making lists of things which were and were not romantic about the ride. Here's what I remember:


**Romantic**

* 4 man teams
* Borrowing kit from a teammate
* Teammate making inspirational laminated route cards for the 40% chance of rain we had all week
* Finishing with all your teammates together
* Womens teams
* womens teams in pink knee-high socks with sock-garters
* Riding in fog
* Racing in rain
* Pulling for a women's team
* Dirt roads
* River crossings without algae
* Rest stops organized beside a river crossing on a dirt road 30 miles from the nearest gas station. 
* Heckling your teammate for getting dropped on a dirt road
* Sunburns in January
* Dedicated photographers shooting your ride
* Hitch racks on cars
* Announcers with 5-star beards
* Ice cold beer at the finish
* Riding 98 miles of backcountry paved and dirt roads without coming across a single traffic light or stop sign. 
* Good coffee at the start with real cream


**Not Romantic**

* Forgetting a piece of kit
* splitting a 4 man team into 2s
* road spray
* Getting dropped by a women's team
* Running out of water at an organized rest stop beside a river crossing on a dirt road 30 miles from the nearest gas station
* Getting dropped by your team on a dirt road
* Carrying a jacket for 98 miles when you didn't need it
* Fitting 2 bikes in the trunk of a sedan
* 15 mph headwinds and 15% grades in the last 10 miles
* Running out of tacos and cokes at the finish
* Chaffing
* Strava app/iPhone battery running out of battery and losing half the ride
* Garmin's route navigation functionality
* Gravel in corners (but any other time it's romantic)
* Teams too busy TeamTimeTrialing to heckle lesser mortals

1345065072.0,14,self.Velo,ya6hn,Just did my first criterium.  I have some questions...,SonicSemae,20,6,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/ya6hn/just_did_my_first_criterium_i_have_some_questions/,"Yesterday, I attempted my first criterium.  This was also my first bike race.  Although it was only a training crit, I've been working towards this all summer and I was both excited and scared.  There were all different types of riders there.  From what I gleaned by talking to people, it seemed to be mostly Cat 2/3/4 racers.  As far I know I was the only one riding with a one-day license.  It was 25 laps of a closed, 1.3 mile course on a one-car wide road.

I got to the course a bit early, did a lap or two to try to familiarize myself with the course and then settled in and waited for the start.  The first couple laps were scary as hell.  I've never really ridden like that in any way, shape, or form, but after a little while I got more comfortable and settled in.  The pace was brilliant, it wasn't demanding at all.  Then, things started to disintegrate.  I took a corner a bit wide and scared one of the other racers (sounded like he had to jam on his brakes).  I think I also jumped out in front of someone else who was trying to pass me.  Eventually, I found myself towards the front of the group and bolted with a couple guys who went off the front.  I held with them for a bit, then realized I had almost half the race left and fell back to the peloton, letting them continue up the road.  I let myself fall about half-way back and then picked up the pace again.  Just after lap 13, someone was passing on the outside of me.  He got a little ahead of me, then pulled into the pack.  I feathered the pedals to slow down a bit, but I was still rather close (about 6 inches or so off his rear wheel).  I'm not sure exactly what happened next, but I remember seeing him stand up out of his saddle.  He slowed down just enough for me to rub up against his rear wheel.  I fought against it, bounced off the rider next to me, and went down.

After sliding across the pavement, I lied there for a fraction of a second trying comprehend what happened.  Then all I heard was, ""Roll!  F***ing roll!""  Still clipped into my bicycle, I half crawled, half lunged off the course and watched the pack whiz by.  Luckily, no one came down with me.  After taking a moment to collect myself, I hopped back on my bike and rode back to the starting line.  I wanted to wait and rejoin the race, but after stopping for a moment I realized that I was bleeding profusely.  The race director and a helpful spectator helped patched me up, and I rode home.

When it was all said and done, I had some nasty road rash on my left side and 3 stitches in my left elbow.  The bike seems to have made it out okay with just cosmetic damage, but I'm going to do a thorough tear-down and inspection before I ride it again.

Despite the crash, I loved the whole experience.  I really want to do it again, but I'm rather scared.  I feel like the crash was my fault (I should have been quicker on the brakes and backed off his rear wheel).  Compared to the other riders, I felt very green and I'm worried I might be a liability.  I guess I'm also just discouraged.  If I can't even finish my first race, how can I expect to make through my second one?

I guess I could use advice.  Should I keep racing?  Is there anything I can do to improve my bike handling skills and keep this from happening again?

**TL;DR**:  Crashed on my first crit and I'm worried I'm a liability to other riders and myself.  Should I keep racing, and what can I do to improve?",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,1345069589.0,,,True,t3_ya6hn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/ya6hn/just_did_my_first_criterium_i_have_some_questions/,

I've been riding since I was a kid (mainly mountain biking back then), stopped riding from about age 18 to 24, started casually riding again (both mountain and road) at age 25, and became  serious about training last June (more road than mountain, especially lately).  I’m now age 27.

Since June, I've dropped 30lbs (now 5' 5"", 132), stopped smoking pot, focused on minimizing fat &amp; simple sugars, maximizing carbs, protein, &amp; vegs in my diet.  I try to eat 4 to 5 small/medium sized meals per day.  Typical training week goes like this:

* Monday (rest)
* Tuesday: intervals - 4 sets of 3 @ 1.5min each
* Wednesday: tempo ride - 2 hours
* Thursday: hills (high intensity) - 1.25 hours
* Friday: recovery ride – 30 to 60 minutes
* Saturday: group ride - 1.75 hours
* Sunday: group ride - 1.75 hours

I always drink a protein + flax + banana + strawberry + water shake and eat some grains after a ride.

For now, my goal is to be able to win a cat 4 race - either a crit or a stage race.  My first race (cat 5 crit) is march 10th.

I love bicycling, I love what it's done to me both mentally and physically, I love pushing myself to do better, and I'm really pleased with the results so far.  

My question is, what do I need to be doing to achieve my current goal of a top finish in a cat 4 race?  Any training suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance,
Mike

Edit: Formatting

Edit 2:  Just want to express my appreciation for all of this advice, thanks for sharing your velo-knowledge with this anxious velo-newb.  So far it seems like I should:

* Incorporate some ""Sweet Spot Training""
* Mix up the length of the intervals
* Replace a group ride with a 3 hour ride/do more endurance + distance rides
* Start perioditizing my training
* Do an easy ride, between the high intensity workouts
* Read up on the Training Bible
* Save some money for a power meter, then use the data to target certain areas of training + monitor progress
* Do some kind of eating during the long rides (still looking into this)
* Aim to be most competitive in races with hills.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,True,,california,True,t3_fr66p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/fr66p/hi_velo_how_can_i_take_my_cycling_fitness_to_the/,

Deleted my account a while back and decided to comeback for this question: Is there any good blogs or websites that have a lot of information about coaching, nutrition, recovery, training plans and access to the latest studies on all kinds of sports? 

I'm an elite rider in Canada and I'm fed up with the concept of having a coach. I feel like I trust them too much and I'm not listening to my body enough. After two disappointing seasons with two different coaches, I want to try to coach myself next season. But in order to do this in a professional way, I need as much information as I can and like any professional, I need access to the latest studies and technologies out there and how they affect me as an athlete. 

I've already bought and going through:

*  The Feed Zone Cookbook
* Cutting Edge Cycling
* Training and Racing with a Powermeter
* The Cyclist's Training Bible
* Weight Training for Cyclists
- The Athlete's Guide to Yoga
- The Athlete's Guide to Recovery

I'm certain that I can go very far with all of this information, but I need to keep myself up-to-date. I'd also be nice if there was a community of coaches and athletes that could answer and discuss training related questions. Finally, I feel like we could learn stuff from other sports as well. Didn't Wiggins have a new preparation with an aussie swimming coach this year? Read: http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/wiggins-lauds-new-training-philosophy

This is where an eventual subreddit comes into my mind. I think we all have something to learn from each other.

1331096418.0,15,self.Velo,qlayc,[Review] November Bicycles RFSC 58s Wheelset,mike_burck,15,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/qlayc/review_november_bicycles_rfsc_58s_wheelset/,"In another thread I mentioned that I have a set of November wheels.  There were a couple of inquiries about how the wheels perform, so I thought I'd write up a (not so) quick review of the wheels. 

**About me:** 

I've been riding seriously for only a couple of years and I only recently started racing. Given that, I know that my review wont (and probably shouldn't) receive the same credibility as a much more experienced rider.  

At the same time, I feel that a lot of November's potential customers have a similar resume as mine --  I love cycling, I race, and though my skill set may not merit the finest mechanical offerings, I want quality gear.

I'm a college student with a pretty nice job, so I'm kind of in a financial grey area;  I'm not scrounging for my next meal and riding a 1982 Walmart Special, but I'm also in no position to drop $2000+ for a set of Zipps.  I spent a lot of time looking at Nuevations, Williams and mysterious Ebay no-namers and eventually settled on the November RFSC 58s (I'll explain why later).

I guess it's also important to note that I'm 165lbs.  

**The Company**

The reason I went with November over the other value brands was because of their business model and customer service.  I could write 1,000 words just on the quality of customer service I recieved **before I was even a paying customer.**  

[The guys that run it](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/about-us/) have [an excellent business model](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/economics/) that makes a ton of sense to me. Spend some time reading their blog and you'll realize that they're racers who sell products to other racers.  Their ability to communicate frankly and without bullshit really resonated with me.  

If you're at all interested in buying something from them, shoot them and email and watch how quickly they shoot back a thoughtful and thorough response. I sent at least a dozen emails with questions and concerns, and each was answered within a few hours.  I had some whacky shipping requests, and they went above and beyond what I expected of them to satisfy my requests.  

They also offer a [nice warranty](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/warranty/), and a [crash replacement plan](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/wheel-crash-replacement/) that makes me a little less nervous every time I use their wheels.  For a budget brand, I thought having a warranty and replacement option was a very reassuring touch.  

**[The Wheels](http://www.novemberbicycles.com/rfsc-58s/)**

I ordred my wheels with the 20/24 build and the standard Novatec hubs.  I missed their pre-order, so my Dec 23rd order meant that my wheels arrived at my door mid-February.  The shipment included some pretty decent skewers, rim tape, valve extenders (with tool) and brake pads. All new orders also include 3 tubes.  

I built mine up with Bontrager race X-Lite tubes and Michelin Pro Race 4 tires.

The first thing that struck me with the wheels was the stiffness.  I had never ridden deep profile carbon wheels before, but I have tried nice alloy rims and I'd put the Novembers above them all in terms of stiffness.  When you say ""Go!"" the wheels are already gone.  I can't speak as a true sprinter, but for my needs the Novembers are plenty stiff.  

The stiffness also makes for excellent handling.  My descending skills have improved immensely since I've been riding my new wheels.  Because they're so responsive, I have a lot more confidence with aggressive lines through the turns.  

Another thing I love about the Novembers is their weight.  At 1525g for the set, they're as light or lighter than most comparable wheels.  They may not satisfy the strictest weight-weenie, but they're light enough for all of the terrain I tackle.  They spin up easily and make for surprisingly capable climbing wheels. 

The standard Novatec hubs are quite nimble and have caused no problems as of yet.  Informal ""spin-those-fuckers-and-see-how-long-they-go"" tests indicate that they are, in fact, pretty nice fuckers.  I wish I had more to say about them, but there's not much to say about hubs besides ""they spin well"".... which they do.  

Like with all carbon wheels (or so I hear), brake performance took some getting used to.  The included brake pads work okay, but I don't feel like I have as much control as I do with aluminum wheels.  I ordered a new set of brakes, so my opinion might change, but for now I give the brake performance a C.  

Aesthetically, the wheels are everything I could have asked for.  I love matte black and I hate bright decals, so I couldn't be more pleased with how they look.  I spent $20 extra on the black spokes, and it makes my ride look extra-ninja-like. 

**Summary**

Pros:

- Great Customer Service
- Super Stiff
- Light Weight 
- Reasonably Priced
- Fast

Cons 

- $900 is *relatively* cheap, but not *cheap* cheap
- Brake performance is lacking
- Not a lot of flash

If you're looking at budget wheels, I can't recommend the Novembers enough.  They're everything you want for racing, without bullshit mark-up or bullshit frills.   ",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_qlayc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/qlayc/review_november_bicycles_rfsc_58s_wheelset/,

I consider myself to be more of a climber than anything else (140lbs/6ft/4w per kg threshold), but as you can see from my threshold, I haven't been riding very long.  I've gone on plenty of group rides, so I feel confident in riding within a pack.  And yes, since it's my first race, it's cat 5.

So that's not what concerns me.  What concerns me is my first race will be a (really short) criterium - 9 miles long.  I've gotten used to doing 60-70 mile rides in the mountains a few times a week, but clearly at a much slower pace.  To me this seems like it will just be nine miles of pure pain, and I'm not confident I'll be able to even keep up.  Additionally, it seems like the race distance is small enough to virtually guarantee that whoever gets into the break will be the winner.

I started riding seriously last year and picked up racing this year, though it's coming towards the end of the racing season here so I'm looking at next year. Currently I average about 140 miles or so a week (usually 200+ recently though due to having more free time) in 30-60 mile rides typically but it is just going out and riding fairly hard - the only real structure I have is that every week I try and get in a hilly ride, a ride where I do a 10 mile TT, and a day off. 

I'm really enjoying my cycling at the moment and I have definitely improved both my speed and endurance, but with a view to moving from occasional pack-finishing cat 4 (UK so the entry cat) to being more competitive, is it worth putting more structure into my rides or can I get away with just going hard over 40 miles three or four times a week, going a little bit slower and further in the winter months?

Been riding about 3 years, and thus far have focused on logging base miles and dropping weight, with my ""training"" consisting almost entirely of Spinervals DVDs in the offseason and trying to hang on during hard in-season rides w/ groups that are faster than me.

I'm thinking about working intervals in this time around, but have no idea if that's where my efforts are best focused or if the gains realized will be dramatic.

As context, I generally have no problem going out for a 70-ish mile group ride and cruising along at 24-26mph (it's flat around here); BUT, stick me in a 30 min cyclocross race with all of its crazy accelerations and whatnot and by the end I feel like my lungs are bleeding and my legs are completely shot (BTW, I don't race crits for this very reason).

So, Velo, what say you about intervals? Is the payoff worth the agony, or should I stick to base miles and Coach Troy and his tucked in t-shirts? If the payoff is there, what do you recommend in terms of a schedule for someone who has done little to no interval work in the past? I'd probably be able to dedicate about 6-10 hours per week (indoors/outdoors combined).

FWIW, I have The Cyclist's Training Bible, but it wasn't really for me because I don't target specific races and harbor no illusions of becoming a dedicated racer any time soon.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions/thoughts.

EDIT: Great info and discussion! Very much appreciate everyone chiming in; hopefully others will see this thread and find it as useful as I have. Funny how discussing intervals is getting me pumped up to go out and ride intervals; everyone says I'll be ready to puke/die by the end of a workout, and that sounds awful, but hot damn I can't wait to get out there and kill myself on the bike!

After working incredibly hard on my fitness over the last 12 months (lost 75lbs) I decided to add a little competition to my hobby and started racing mid way through this season. 

My first race went well. It was a crit, about 18mi and fairly technical. I was dropped by the pack but I did finish (not last place either). Second race was a TT, and I really enjoyed it. I wanted more. My third race was a 31mi road race and it was yesterday. The Cat5 group looked extraordinarily sketchy even before the race started which would prove itself true after only about 4mi into the race as I was lying on my back in the middle of the road.

I went down hard. After seeing some X-rays today, I learned I suffered a grade 3 AC separation and torn rotator cuff, along with the loss of a decent amount of skin. The damage to my body is nothing compared to the damage to my bike (totaled).

So now I'm left here, awaiting medical bills and deciding on which frameset to build up, wondering if this will be my first and last racing season.

But a win is a win, and I'll take it. 

This one was relatively easy. 19m hillclimb of Mt. Hamilton in San Jose. 3 distinct climbs with 2 short descents in the middle.

I pushed the pace at the top of the first two climbs, and led both descents. By the 3rd climb we were down to 4 riders. I tried to jump with 5 miles to go, but 2 of the 3 came with me so I sat up.

Around 4m to go I increased the pace for a good bit, then with 2 to go we turned into a tailwind section. I jumped as hard as I could for 90 seconds, and when I looked back I had a 20-second lead on 2nd place.

I just kept a measured effort from there, with one eye on 2nd place, making sure he couldn't close. Kept waiting for something to go wrong, but it didn't. Finished comfortably in first. 

I have another 5! c-5 races if I do all 10. I'm thinking of asking to go to 4s early if I place well at my next race. But I'll savor the wins while I can.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,california,True,t3_hr0fb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/hr0fb/velo_2_in_a_row_for_me_c5_group_a/,

We're around 60 guys in Cat D at the start line. The course is 4 x 27 km and totally flat and on many narrow roads, but with a lot of wind, which came to play a crucial role. First lap is relatively easy and apart from a few accelerations to kind of test the field, nothing happens. I take notice on the crosswind sections and stay in front (4th-15th pos). 

Second lap is pretty much the same, but then on the 3rd lap some strong guys decide to tear the whole thing apart. I am in a bad position at this point and start to panic a little because there's no room for moving up. Speed is around 45-50 kph for 4-5 km in a terrible crosswind where the field is strung out. People start to open gaps and blow up and I know this is a decisive moment. I jump from group to group while small gaps open everywhere and now I can actually see the front group, 12-14 guys drilling it. 

I realize I don't have the power to make another jump and bridge the gap, so I sit with 5 others or so and we start working together. We have the front group only 100 meters ahead, but we don't seem to be getting closer. One guy decides to use his lead in the double paceline to attack and try to bridge for himself. He fails and the group stops working together because everyone is in survival mode trying to hang on because of the acceleration... I call him a retard and tell people to get back in the paceline, but everyone is wasted. I have two options: bridge the gap myself or accept my faith. I try to bridge and go with all I got for 3-4 minutes, but the deal is done. The front group is now 250 meters up ahead and I'm blown.

5 or 6 other guys then join us, now on the final lap, and we kind of get a chase going again, but we know they are gone. I win the second group sprint by going out in the wind alone on the opposite side of the road, while everyone is trying to get shelter and find a good wheel to follow, but I'm the first guy to not get points... Fucking fuck.

Here's a pic of second group sprint with me in front (sorry about the quality):

http://i.imgur.com/FGvbh.jpg

I'm a little disappointed because I feel I should've been in the front group. But I can only blame myself for poor positioning, especially when it's so windy... Overall a good and very hard race. My computer said 42 kph average which is slightly above normal for my category.

How do you stay focused, what do you do to motivate yourself to stay aggressive, and how do you cope when a race doesn't go your way?

**Expanded Info and Context:**  I have been a cat 3 racer for 2 years now, and typically race 2x week from March - Sept.  I am pretty focused and dedicated with my trainig and diet and whatnot, but cannot seem to ever position myself to do better than 7th place in many of the races I enter.  I believe it is mostly because I can't get out of my head and tell myself to move or act.  I feel myself start to panic when it gets down to the wire, slinking back in the pack and losing position.  Then, after doing poorly in a race [e.g not top 6, which I aim for to get upgrade points], I spend *days* beating myself up mentally, losing sleep, almost willing to give up the sport entirely.  I am hoping racers who do well can provide some advice not only on how to maintain a positive and clear mental state during the race, but also how to mentally recover after a poor race.  

In terms of fitness, I frequently ride with many cat 1s and 2s and other 3s that do well or win in racing situations and have no problems winning town line sprints or pulling/chasing down breaks on our ""world championship"" group rides against them.  I know this is not fantastic evidence of physical fitness for bike racing purposes, and maybe this is why I am misguided, but I don't know what else to look at to assess whether it's physical or not.

I was sitting 6th into the final bend, lost about 15 metres to the front three riders on the hairpin turn but then managed to go past 4th and 5th in the final 150 metre sprint which was a 4-5% grade. Caught up to the first three on the line, and finished 4th with 1st only a bike length ahead of me. 

So, I think I would have won if I had cornered better or attacked just before the bend.

My problem with cornering seems to be my fear of leaning too far and slipping out. Before tonight I thought I was pretty good at cornering but I noticed all the way through the race that I wasn't cornering as well as a lot of others and it was costing me energy. I often ended up losing more speed and taking longer lines around the corner.

Now I've read up on cornering techniques and kind of know what I have to do, but any extra tips would be great.

Also, I'll do a few training sessions focussing on cornering in the next week or so. What do you recommend I try? How do I see how much I can lean without stacking?

* Created a google docs to collaborate
* Outline the topics we want to cover for the wiki/faq
* Nominate one or two peeps to oversee general flow/outline 
* Flesh out the sections
* No arguing, if there's a difference of opinion on stuff we can have footnotes with alternative viewpoints. 
* Edit/fine tune/trim sections/content less relevant (no hurt feelings)
* Move it into community wiki here on /r/velo
* One or two contributors finalize editing
* Publish
* Update as needed

I have the google docs created, /u/tubadeedoo has written some stuff up already. I've begun an outline of topics. To make this *good* and *useful* will be quite an undertaking. 

I like wiki format better than faq format, but that's me, Whoever wants to oversee the outline can make that decision, or contributors can vote whatever. 

So... Post up here if you want to help and in what capacity. Thinking out loud here, we likely need:

* one to two master-editors to make the overall decisions on format and content
* plenty of contributors to writing
* an few illustrators to help contributors with figures - pro shit ya?
* A couple people good with reddit formating for the wiki code

Thoughts? Suggestions? Critiques? Help?

I've been wanting to make a post of this sort for a week or so now and decided 4am this morning to do it.

I really don't know how I am planning on structuring this post, or what questions I'll be asking or statements I'll be making. I think I'll be rambling quite a bit. I just hope to get some feedback and advice. 

I was an elite highschool runner, division 1 scholarships, top 5 recruit out of the state, etc etc. I did this on, what my coach called a lot of ""talent"" and some hardwork. I didn't train as much as my competitors, slacked off a lot and was injured a lot. I didn't accept my scholarships and decided to go division 3, no scholarships not as good of competition.  I did this because i wanted to be with my friends and was scared to go off on my own to a different state, sometimes i regret this decision as I'm in a lot of debt now.  I ran at this school for 1 year, and was injured almost the entire time, training almost exclusively on an ""anti-gravity"" treadmill, because of my injuries.  I quit running july 2011, because I was tired of being injured and was burnt out on running.  

I sat on my ass, doing literally nothing but playing videogames, reddit, work, school until late june this year when I decided to start riding my bike to work and cancel my car insurance.  My commute was short and easy but I had a good time.  After commuting for a few weeks I thought to myself ""Hmm. Let's ride this bike far.""  I found bikeit, velo, and peloton and was hooked, started riding my dad's steel racing bike from the 80s ""a long ways"" did a half century on a whim one day and it was awesome averaged like 16mph and felt like a fucking badass.  Then I started going into a bike shop a lot, found out they had a weekly ride.  For 10 days after my splurge week (the week I decided to ride my bike a lot, 160miles) I didn't really do much besides my commute.

My first group ride was great (July 25th). I showed up in old running tights and a drifit tee shirt. didn't think i'd be the only young person there or the only steel bike rider there, I was.  We did a loop I had never heard of with what I thought were big hills, now I know they're just little bumps in the road, and it was hard. I got through it but it was tough.  Was a 30mile ride at a tougher pace than I was used to, but it was a no drop ride so it wasn't too bad.  

From there I was hooked, I spent the whole next week debating buying a new bike with the tip money I had been saving from my job, and I caved.  Bought a nice BMC street racer with full 105 (aug 8th).  It is a beaut, I love it.

All of August I spent riding that thing, group rides, solo rides, even 2 crits! Many of you might remember my post [""fucking ducks, my first crit""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/xvage/race_report_first_crit_fucking_duck/) or something like that.  That took place the first week of august.  I didn't even own a kit yet, was still riding in old running tights and running shirt.

I have a kit now. 2 actually. Bibs are pretty great. Wouldn't ever ride without one again.

I guess now that the history is over I'll get onto the main point.

My second crit was the last week of August. I had been riding all month long and felt a lot stronger. It was a cat 4/5 and again had a massive head wind on the home stretch.  Pretty much I led 1/3 of the race alternating the lead with a bunch of other riders all the while the more experienced riders just let a few of us do all the work for them.  No one really knew who I was and they all had confused looks after the race.  I didn't finish well as in turn 3 on the final lap with 200 or 300 ft left my inside pedal hit the ground and I bounced a foot into the air.  Ended up staying up-right but was shocked and scared so I didn't sprint, just coasted into the finish.  Was in 3rd place when my pedal hit the ground.  I got a lot of compliments after the race and people giving me advice. Most of the people in the field had been riding for years, I asked a lot of them because I was curious.  I thought ""Hm. I've only been riding for a little over a month, could I be good at this?""  

The following weeks I really tried to push myself on rides. (I know strava isn't a good measure of ability but it's all I really have to go off of) I was beginning to post times that were right up there with cat 1/2/3 riders in the area. Just this week I took two KOMs from a cat 2 rider i have become friendly with; he works at the LBS I bought my bike at. (I bet him $50 I could take his times in 6 months, did it in 1.5) He told me i'd never get them.  The second KOM I took yesterday the first time I rode the segment.  I stopped by the LBS before my ride and asked how to get to it, he told me how and said ""You'll never get it, and if you do I'll cut your spokes"" (jokingly of course).

So I'm just wondering, if I'm ""competing"" with cat 1/2/3 riders on hilly strava segments after riding for about two months, what can I expect if i keep it up for years to come with real structured training, not just ""Oh, I wanna go ride that hill today"".

I have just over 1000 miles logged in the 2 months I've been riding. I turned 20 less than a month ago.  Where does my future lie if i keep it up?  What can I do to become the best cyclist I can be?  I've bought the bible, and read a bit, but don't have a Power Meter.  I'm determined and really like cycling.. a lot more than running. Tell me your thoughts, advice, tell me I'm a moron, anything! I'd love to hear from you guys here on velo. 

Here's my [strava](http://app.strava.com/athletes/723519), has every ride I've done so far.

I apologize for the ramblyness of this... I tried to proof read it, and such but it's 5:30am now... I'm going to sleep...

I am buying my first new bike, probably a CAAD10 rival and putting some upgrades on it right away. Wheels are one of the area's I am looking at going into.

I am a 140 lb 5'9"" rider. So my two questions are, if money was available for any set of race wheels, what would you recommend? If money is kept tight and limited to maybe $1500, what would you recommend then?

I can only justify one set of race wheels right now. They should be clinchers. I expect durability and value. I'm honestly not sure if aero rims are worth it for my only set or if traditional box are best. And by race wheels, I mean a set I'll probably end up training on at least some of the time too -- unless that is a huge no-no in this price range and then I will go cheaper.

Do I treat this week as a recovery week, and the following week as a peak week?  If not, how should I transition in the next 12 days?

Bonus question: my good friend &amp; teammate is hoping to wrap up a series win at a local criterum.  It's pretty important to him and we've all been working hard together as a team to get him points.  The final race is Thursday afternoon 8/25/11.  I want to do some work for him at the race, but from what I've read, 2 days before an ""A"" race should be off the bike, or at most, a short recovery ride...  It's possible that he can secure the series win  by taking 1st in the 1st prime...  Would it be a terrible idea to help my buddy in the crit &amp; drop out after the 1st prime, given that my ""A"" race starts 36 hours later?

1) Do sports-specific products really work better than 'normal' food or was my experience down to ineffective fueling prior to eating the bar?

2) If sports nutrition products are worth it, how do I choose a brand?  They all seem to do pretty much the same thing, so is it just down to taste preferences?
Some brands I quite like the look of:
Powerbar - favorable experience
SIS - British company (I'd like to support my own country's products) and sponsor lots of cycling teams
High5 - British company and sponsor lots of endurance events.  Seem very popular on wiggle.  Their packaging do make their products seem very low-tech though
Clif Bar - I like the idea of natural ingredients and the simple product range.  They do not seem to have much involvement with pro cycling though

How does everyone else handle over training?

I've gotten into some limited racing over the end of this last road season with a good group of friends and after really enjoying it (and some good results/wins) we plan on competing as much as possible next year. Problem! Most races are 2+ hours away and it has been getting pretty expensive for all of us, even carpooling, between entrance fees and travel costs. We know that's all part of the game but we want to try and limit the financial hit we'll be taking racing next year as much as possible. 

Anyway we've set up a budget for next year for the 6 of us and have a little over half of it pledged so far by local businesses willing to sponsor us. 

My questions to you guys are:

**A** Will we be required to register as a team with USA Cycling? (We're all Cat 5) 4 Cat 5 men, 1 male junior, and 1 cat 4 woman. I've read into this a bit on USA Cycling and if we're required to host an event...that isn't really plausible.  

**B** Will we be required to register as a corporation to accept money from these local businesses? I've been told we'll need a Tax ID if ~~we want our sponsors to be able to write off their contributions,~~ and I assume we'll have to sign an agreement that we're willing to do X activity to receive Y benefit. 

Thanks!

We rolled out at 6:45am for a 35mi circuit race in a local park and my team showed up deep - eight guys controlling the front for most of the race. We were trading turns following breaks for the first two laps and then one broke right in front of me and not to be a slouch I followed it despite having just pulled the field up to a doomed break. 

The guy who broke away was really strong, riding a heavy gear at ~26mph *average*. Since I followed, my team was blocking for us on the front but one other guy managed to bridge the (at that point) 30sec or so gap on this rolling parcours. So me and the guy who initiated were trading turns, putting down ridiculous power and maintaining our gap and this other dude just sat in for a while. Initially, my thoughts were ""it's cool, he just killed himself in no-man's-land trying to bridge, we'll let him rest for a few turns, then we can really solidify this break."" 

After about ten or so leg-crushing pulls on the front of our pitiful little break, I realized this guy's intention was to just sit in - for the entirety of the life of the break. Every time I would pull off the front and the initiator would pull through, this guy was at least a bike-length and a half off his wheel forcing me to either fuck with the tempo or fall in second again. 

Sure, we yelled at him, cussed at him, tried to shake him; but nothing worked, he simply refused to do any work. We got him to take the lead only twice, but each time the pace suffered dramatically and we wasted valuable time cajoling him into the wind.

Then, after about six laps of intense effort, as we were approaching the only moderately graded hill on the course, the initiator of the break motions to me that he wants to shake the tagalong. I was nearly cooked but I was game. We both broke away in beautiful harmony. Then we did it again. and again. 

The whole time this tagalong dude was absolutely glued to my wheel, he was so fresh from riding our slipstream, there was no shaking him. The initiator surged hard for the fourth time and I simply couldn't follow. The tagalong went around me and the two ended up dropping me on that hill.

Luckily, as I was sensing I was about to get swallowed up by the field, four riders shoot past me and the second in line, a teammate, slaps me hard on the back as he passes and says ""we got 'em."" They caught the other two up the road and managed to stay clear of a field that had forgotten about them entirely.

My teammate ended up getting 4th, the guy who initiated the break wound up getting 5th (If I remember correctly) and the tagalong guy snagged 2nd in the sprint. 

I know this is all totally legal in racing and it happens in pro races all the time - where one guy just sits in and snakes the sprint - but I can't not forever think of that guy as a complete and utter scumbag for doing that ""legal"" as it may be. What's your take r/velo? sitting in on a 3 man break for the majority of a race, doing practically zero work, and then trying to take the win. cool or uncool?

tl;dr: out on a 3 man break for most of a race with no help from one guy who then sprints onto the podium - cool/uncool?

EDIT: thanks for the feedback everyone, It's great hearing everyone's take. ALSO! I should have made it clearer that all three of us on the break were from different teams, not me and a teammate versus one other guy.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,True,,,True,t3_r4fj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/r4fj6/race_report_tagalongs/,

Though having not ridden for a week or so because of finals and school, I managed to make it through all the selections and stay with the lead pack of the race (albeit I was struggling for most of the race until I got comfortable). On the back half of the last lap, a couple riders got antsy in the pack and squeezed onto a guy unfortunately stuck in the middle of them. Someone ended up hitting one of the middle guy's wheels and he lost control. He hit the road right in front of me and I had no room to avoid him. After gathering myself off the asphalt and resetting my dropped chain, I managed to somehow still claim 8th in the crit. I didn't realize until after I got to the finish line that there was a sizable dent in the top tube from either buckling or impacting something on the middle guy's bike.

I'd like to check them out, because I've always been intimidated by crits.  However, most of my training has been for endurance events, save for the weekly cross training race.  

Questions for you hammerheads: 

* Will the cross training carry over as far as the two types of racing being similar (an hour of all out effort)? 
* Should I be transitioning to intervals to simulate the accelerations, or will my endurance rides still be beneficial? 
* What are your favorite workouts for crit training?

I'll be leaving for the crit at 4:30pm so it'll probably too early to eat dinner but any snacks I should have?

What about gels? I use Cytomax anyway so I'll have that in my bottle but what are your thoughts on eating a Gu or something like 15 minutes before the race?

Reading the other threads it seems the general pace for a cat 4/5 is around 22 mph for the slower rider and around 25-26 mph for the winners. Right now I can ride the same distance as the crit (~12 miles) on a slightly hillier course with an average of 20.7 mph but it doesn't have the corners like the crit course has. Do you think I'm in decent shape for the race or is it likely I will get dropped pretty fast?

I'm pretty nervous but I can't wait to race. I appreciate all your input!

Edit: To clarify, the crit is considered part of a training series so it's nothing to serious but after being a spectator at it, it's not a race to be taken lightly.

With the Giro d'Italia just around the corner, it's time for us to open up our Velogames Fantasy Competition league!

For those that haven't played Velogames before, it's a similar concept to fantasy football. You pick your riders and they score points based on a bunch of different metrics. You may make unlimited changes to your team until the entry deadline of 13:30 CEST on Saturday 4th May 2013. Once the race starts, there are no transfers, so you won't be able to change your team again throughout the race. Your picks must include the following:

* 2 All-Rounders
* 2 Climbers
* 1 Sprinter
* 3 Domestiques
* 1 Wild Card

The rules and scoring system can be found [here](http://www.velogames.com/giro-ditalia/2013/rules.php)

You can sign up here: [Velogames Fantasy Spring Classics](http://www.velogames.com/giro-ditalia/2013/index.php)

1366636551.0,9,self.Velo,1cv0cd,(First!) Race Report - Mooresville Challenge (Crit),studentengineer,10,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1cv0cd/first_race_report_mooresville_challenge_crit/,"First race ever!

4/5 Start was at 10am. I was at the park at 7am to watch the Masters race and get a feel for the track. 1 mi loop; first half is curvy with nice 5-10ft rollers ... then a sharp ~30ft drop with a right hand turn, followed by a CAT5 climb to the finish line.

Did not really do much of a warm up; I rode the course 3 or 4 times early in the morning at Z3 to get a feel for lines.

Lined up and saw a familiar face at the start; a fraternity brother from a different school, and we introduced ourselves and talked a little bit. Staged at the line, this is where the race day jitters really started to sink in. My only goals for my first race were to A.) not wreck anyone and B.) not get spit OTB. There were 35 riders for the 4/5; I planned on staying in the peloton in the back 5-10 spots to just observe.

The 50 minute crit race started and everyone got up to speed. I settled in the back for a majority of the race behind my fraternity brother and observed everyone else's tactics. I remember looking at the official time every lap we did and thinking ""we're only 12 min in?!"", but I finally found my groove and settled in. Everything else was second nature and I do not really remember anything until 2 laps to go. At this point I am still feeling quite good and think about making a go of it just for fun. As the thought is in my mind, my new friend attacks mid pack up the final hill pre-bell lap. He is cut off by a slower rider and loses momentum. As we pass the bell I can tell he is really tired. At this point I am still trying to follow my goals A and B, and figure I can burn my final match here where there is minimal chance of me screwing things up for others. He is falling off the back of the group, so I get next to him and ask him if he wants to grab my wheel and go up the right side. He nods and gets behind me, and I bust my ass and take him up the inside for 3/4 mi and drop him off back in the top 10. My buddy ended up in the top 10; I finished with the group; 25/30. 

Things I learned:

1. I don't know why I put two full bottle waters on my frame for this race; I never even thought of drinking during the 50 minutes.

2. (At least in this race) CAT 5 was not as sketchy as everyone on this forum made it out to be. If anything was even semi risk in terms of movement, it was called out by the rider and confirmed by those around him.

3. You can make friends just doing a little small talk in the back of the peloton.

4. The last lap is stupid fast.

5. I need to do more group rides ASAP. Though I was fine being square in the middle of the peloton, I was uncomfortable on ""choke points"" in the race.

6. I could have done a MUCH better job of hiding from the wind, see number 5 above.

7. It felt really good to sacrifice for others; that is what I enjoy about racing the most so far.

C. I apparently have my FTP set too low (IF 1.09); NP was 300W even for a 45min race, I had FTP at 275W. Felt fine at the end, could easily finish 1h at that pace.

I'm a Cat 3, looking to move out of my parents house and explore the country racing and training on the bike. Thinking I'll take a road trip this summer to look for a happier location among the greater 48 states! I'll explain my present situation and ask questions at the end...

-My current training routes are something like this: I've got a back road route that gets me to Caumsett Park with few traffic lights (For those of you who don't know, traffic lights on the Long Island Expressway service road, can really wreck the rhythm of a ride). Once near the park, there's an 8 mile stretch of road with rolling hills and a large hill in each direction.  The loop at LIU Westbury campus is ~3.5 miles long with rolling hills; it's very safe and relatively close to my home town (in Nassau County). Kissena Velodrome is a 30 minute car ride away (though I haven't invested in track cycling yet) , and there are training crits at Floyd Bennett Field (in Brooklyn~ 45 mins to an hour and 15 mins away) every Tuesday night during the summer. The hill climbs we have around here are 2:30 ~ 4 minutes max (the short hills are very steep while the longer hills are pretty gentle inclines) so, it's hard to get any real climbing in without driving 1.5 hours to Bear Mountain. In other words, there are no real hills to climb, or flats to hammer around my town.

I belong to a medium size club: 50~60 strong, broken up into three groups (fast, intermediate, and slow), with about 20 cyclists in each group. I am currently the fastest cyclist in the group (I don't mean to brag; I'm just trying to give an honest overview in hopes that some of you will do the same). I'm training with power and I dream of getting my Cat 1 license! I am looking for a place to live, where geography and access to other bike resources will foster my growth as a cyclist and athlete.

Do any of you, wonderful cyclists (American or otherwise) live somewhere worth noting for it's effective geography/ group rides/ access to races/ availability of teams/ anything I forgot to mention/ etc...? I would love to hear about them!

This is my first winter riding a trainer (or riding at all for that matter; Cycleops Fluid2 FYI).

Thing is, a Watt on the trainer is much harder than a Watt on the road, or at least that is what my heart and RPE is telling me. I can sit at 200W on the road with a heart rate of ~145bpm, but on the trainer, 200W steady state and I am pushing a constant HR of ~170bpm.

Now I know that the trainer cannot be exactly like the road: that the bike flexes differently, that the flywheel needs constant energy to maintain its velocity, that I am more inefficient with the buildup of heat, etc.

What I did tonight was instead of staying in zone 2 in terms of watts (160-215W for me) I stayed in zone 2 in terms of heart rate (121-150bpm) which put me at an average output of 140W. It felt much more like a typical aerobic day; legs feel like they rode, but it wasn't terribly difficult and could be done day after day without rest.

This is my first year of road racing and third of racing at the velodrome.

This year, I've been involved in four wrecks. The first was unequivocally my fault. I was breaking off the front of the pack in a crit, and went too fast around a corner. My back tire kicked out and I went down quick. Thankfully, was far enough ahead that only one other came down with, sustaining minor road rash. He was able to continue, I was not.

The next two happened in a single day at the velodrome. Pulling off the boards for warmup, I settled in right behind the guy at the front of the pace line. Immediately, he slips on a painted line. I missed the split-second opportunity to go high, and we go down at about 10mph. One other comes down with us. Everyone is fine but me — I banged up my hip badly enough that walking was excruciating, but back on the bike I was pain-free. I sat out the next race, but joined in the one after.

Two races later, a points race. I'm leading in points after the first twelve laps, and the peloton has settled down after the previous sprint. I'm riding at the middle of the track, there's a pace line down in the sprinter's lane, and another line just above me. Suddenly, in turn three, the third rider in the sprint lane decides he's had enough of the pace and swings out wide — without looking, right through my front wheel. I try to pull up as much as possible before he makes contact, but it's not enough (any higher, and I would have gone into the group above me). Six or seven go down, one guy has a nasty arm break.

Jump to yesterday. My first race since the previous events, with about two months of training and touring in-between. It's a road race, and we're about seven miles in. I'm sitting in the middle of the pack, riding conservatively, watching the other riders for any hints of instability or wobbliness. Everyone's riding well, nobody's done anything crazy, and people are just sitting in and letting the miles tick by. I reach down for my water bottle on a slight downhill, when I see a flash of blue on the road. A tenth of a second later, my front wheel is airborne, having just run over a reflector (glued smack in the *middle* of the lane, not at the center line) at about 35mph. My bike yaws right and pitches left, and there's not much I can do when the front wheel makes contact with the ground.

Four accidents in one race season is a lot. Obviously, the first accident could have been prevented through just having more experience and — simply put — being better. The third, I think, was entirely out of my hands.

[The podium](http://i.imgur.com/7u5zY.jpg)



**TLDR:**  Shit was hot, Mark’s (teammate) advice kept me from overheating and cramping, Sean (our team’s sprinter playing the role of domestique in this race) was indispensably helpful throughout the race, the finish was chaotic &amp; painful, and I managed to take 3rd.
 


**Also, full sized cyclists and generally more awesome cyclists, try not to hate on this 128 pound guy's power numbers or any Fred moves I may not realize, but feel free to comment/critique/etc.**
 
 


Bakersfield is really hot.  The Garmin was reading over 100 degrees at the race start and it says the average temperature during the race was 99.4.  But thankfully the heat didn't overwhelm me like it did a few weeks earlier at De Vlees (similar course, same location).   I credit this to Mark’s suggestion of putting some bags of ice in my jersey and taking electrolyte pills during the race in addition to the 2 bottles of ice cold water with me at the start, a bottle of ice cold water from Wifey at the feed zone, another bottle of the icy cold that Sean picked up at the feed for me, and a few extra splashes of water from Sean’s extra water.  Don’t get me wrong though, it was uncomfortably hot out there, just not overwhelmingly hot.
 


In fact, the first lap was almost comfortable, save for a few efforts in Sean’s draft to close gaps within the pack.  People were already blowing up at the first climb, but Sean hung in there like a boss.  He kept a close eye on the front of the group as mini breaks would form and identify whether or not they were a threat.  Small gaps formed on some of the rollers, but Sean brought me right back to the front group’s wheels, always with a smooth consistent tempo to make it easy on my explosive-power-lacking muscles.  I thought for sure I’d set some MMPs for the race on the second lap up the first climb since it felt a bit harder than the first lap, but my 5 minute MMP was on the first lap up the first climb – only 93% of FTP.  Part of that’s the heat – it really saps power out of everyone’s body.  Part of that’s the beauty of sitting in the pack with a domestique who knows when to chase and when it's safe to sit in.
 


The group was mostly together after the turnaround on lap one (Eat some Gu, take some electrolyte pills, pour water on self, keep on Sean’s wheel), but shortly after, Tommy (a friend &amp; cyclist with a reputation for his incredible power) managed to build up about 30 seconds off the front.  On one of the mini climbs after the turn around, it looked like Sean was approaching explosion zone, but those bad asses from Die Hard (the original, of course) correctly cut the red wire, and Sean managed to make it over the top, guts intact.  On the way back to the feed zone Sean decided the best risk/reward at the feed zone would be for each of us to grab one bottle of the icy cold.  Sean gave his bottle to me.  The plan went off without a hitch.
 

Oh right, Tommy is still 30 to 45 seconds off the front (he likes it out there).  The group wasn't anxious to reel him on the flat, so Sean went up front to put in a few pulls and rally the troops.  As we approached the base of the first climb (2nd lap), there was a solid 10-15 person pace line going and it wasn’t long until we had Tommy back with us.  Sean relieved himself of his domestique duty and received an honorable discharge, having done everything I could have asked of him and even things I didn’t know I needed (like to not risk grabbing two separate bottles at the feed).  At this point there were probably about 25 people in the front group out of the 85 who started the race.
 


So the rollers out to the turnaround were pretty uneventful.  A few minor attacks were quickly brought back without gaining more than 5 seconds (Eat some Gu, take some electrolyte pills, pour water on self).  Tommy attacked on the main downhill, but everyone knows what he’s capable of, so that was shut down pretty quickly.  We mostly soft pedaled on the flat approaching the final kicker &amp; finish line.  I made sure I stayed near the front with shelter from the cross wind. 
 


2 minutes from the line, just before the base of the kicker, a rider went off the front and just kind of teased the group (HR 140).  I went for the bait. I put in a 20 second 290 watt dig (HR is 175) to bridge up to his wheel.  The group surged behind me.  Another 20 seconds at 290 watts later (HR is 182) we’re at the base of the kicker and Tommy guns it.  I feel my right inner quad claim cramp, but surely it’s bluffing (No legs, you’re not cramping, you’re pedaling, so shut up and pedal!).  35 seconds at 575 watts later (HR is 196), I’m one wheel behind Tommy (Jim is on Tommy’s wheel) and dear god I’m in a world of hurt as I start to fade.  Tommy seems gassed and so does Jim.  I sit behind Jim for another 15 seconds at 315 watts [HR is 197].  **“HERE THEY COME HERE THEY COME THEY’RE COMING AROUND ON THE LEFT THEY’RE SPRINTING!”** shouts someone behind me.   Two guys wiz by me.  I pull around Jim as my legs are begging for me to stop the pain and my heart &amp; lungs are overwhelmed with oxygen debt (something something financial Armageddon, bailout, Federal Reserve prints 25 seconds more of oxygen) (HR is 198).  I hammer with every last bit of I-don’t-know-what for 25 more seconds at 435 watts (HR is 199) and I am absolutely beyond wrecked, so much so, that I stopped pedaling a few feet in before the finish line, but thankfully no one came around me.  3rd place.  3rd F-ing place.  Feels good man.

Can I just jump into intro races without getting dropped, or do I need a season to train and prepare myself?

I would really appreciate any advice or source material in regards to training, where to start looking for intro races, and what to expect when/if I get there.

1332601463.0,9,self.Velo,rbfle,Race Report - Not having much luck!,ductions,9,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/rbfle/race_report_not_having_much_luck/,"*WALL OF TEXT INITIATED. Scroll down for tl;dr!*

[Last week I wrote about my first race of the year](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/r23ub/race_report_first_of_the_year/) . The week leading up to it all I could think about were things that could go wrong. Which didn’t really help my nerves. That race started ok, but I was dropped on the 1st of 4 laps at the first hill. I carried on and finished but not in true racing fashion. 

Today I had my first proper criterium race at Victoria Park in Leamington Spa and compared to the lead up to my first race I hardly thought about it during the week and was relatively calm. I’d even go as far as to say I was feeling pretty confident, especially as it was just 4th cat riders and most importantly no hills. In fact as a criterium the race couldn’t be more different from last week’s race.

Andy, my clubmate who was also taking part kindly drove me to Leamington. We signed on and put our numbers on. After taking advice from others, I brought along my trainer so I could get a proper warm up. I spent a good 15 minutes spinning - could really feel my legs loosening up, not something I’d want to experience at the start of a race. I then joined Andy riding around the course to get a feel for it. Very smooth and very fast. Also a lot of carbon!

At 9:30 we lined up ready to start. By now the adrenaline and nerves had set in, but I imagine that is normal. The flag went down and we raced. I thought it was going to be a lot quicker than it started - I knew I wasn’t going to get dropped this time. After reading up on basic racing tactics, I tried to stay near the front in order to avoid the elastic band effect of the peloton that you get from staying at the back (which absolutely killed me last year at racing at Mallory Park). Something clicked during this race, and I felt confident enough to move up and to the side without feeling like I’m going to kill someone. I think maybe I did get shouted at once for going a little wide on a corner, but I like to think this is part of the learning experience.

As the course was basically an oval there were no sharp corners, although the last corner leading to the finish was the sharper than the rest. I managed to hold my line at all times. It really is quite an experience going around corners at ~30mph with a guy on your left and a guy on your right both leaning into the curve taking the same line as you.

Fitness wise I felt great, and even when I was moving up in the bunch on the outside, I still felt like I had more to give. I probably should’ve pulled, but didn’t want to risk it - maybe next time. 

When the final lap bell rang, the speed instantly picked up, and you could see more riders slumped into their drops really giving it some. I was still quite near to the front, and was keeping up fine. People started moving up (or more accurately, overtaking me) coming out of the first corner. I’ve read many times that there is no point sprinting to finish in a race like this if you aren’t in the top 10. And it makes sense, you’re not going to win anything and will probably cause a crash.

But that is what happened next. Coming to the last “tight” corner I heard shouts and a loud pop, and then saw people on the ground. This all happened in a split second right in front of me. I think I braked with both hands, not locking the front, but as it was such a sudden stop I went right over my handlebars, narrowly avoiding a tree and landing head first on the grass (not the first time this has happened!). I’m not entirely sure what had happened in front of me, but I’m really glad I hadn’t caused the crash. I lay on the ground for a bit, and the St. Johns guys made sure I was ok. I sat up to see [Andy bloody faced](http://yfrog.com/ketlrtcj) being treated on the track. He lost half a tooth and split his chin open. 

So frustrating as it was the last corner with the finish line in sight. As I hit my head I decided not to take part in the second race of the day, and I think I would’ve been a little on edge. And plus, we had to sort out car/bike/hospital/home logistics with my mum, Andy and his friend.

Video (of race and crash) is uploading on youtube right now.

2) More specifically, I've been looking for a car that can fit two bikes inside (front wheel off, back seats down), standing up (not lying on top of each other), and then have enough room to shove gear bags/wheels in between. Ideally I'd like to not have to take the seatposts out, but that can be done if need be. Budget is about $30k. New is okay, used is okay, ideally newer (2005+). Reliability is always good. Manual transmission are also good. Not looking for crossovers or SUVs. 

I've got a roof rack now, but I am really starting to hate it. I hate the way the car drives with bikes on the roof with any sort of wind, the lack of security, even with locks on the trays, the gas mileage hit, the extra noise, and the potential for damage due to road debris or stray wildlife (it's happened). I'd also like to avoid using a hitch rack as well, for similar security reasons, and the issue of bikes being destroyed if rear ended, along with the car (Texans can be shitty drivers). 

Things that have popped up on my short list are:

* Volkswagen Jetta SportsWagen TDI - Crossed off unfortunately due to a really shallow cargo area.  
* Subaru Legacy GT/Outback - Similar to the VW, surprisingly shallow loading area.  
* Honda Fit - Surprisingly roomy. Saw two bikes loaded up inside (diagonally) with wheels and gear shoved in between this weekend.  
* Volvo V70R - Unfortunately hard to find with lower miles.  
* Mazdaspeed3 - Not sure if bikes can fit in the back. Anyone with a 3 can confirm whether they can or not?  
* Subaru Impreza WRX STi - I've seen one bike fit in the back of the hatch version with the seats down, but can two?  
* Mercedes Benz E350 - Depreciation on these things is awesome, and puts them within budget. Not sure if bikes will fit, but it's as capacious as the Volvo.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,True,,ustx,True,t3_ln3k0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/ln3k0/car_shopping_multiple_race_bike_hauler/,

This spring I bought a Cannondale Synapse alloy; I am slower on it than on my hybrid.

In any case, I remembered that Garmin-Cervelo puts up edge data from some of their riders, so I decided to see how WKO rated them.

[David Millar's (select) Power Profile](http://i.imgur.com/LdNkk.png)

In that image, the bars to the left are from his winning ITT in 3 Days of De Panne (2010) wherein he also took the overall.  The right-hand bars are from stage 19 of the Tour de France (ITT).  I [grabbed his weight from here](http://www.slipstreamsports.com/garmin-slipstream-pro-team/pro-men/david-millar).  Granted, his race weight may actually be much lighter than that, but it's still amazing to me that WKO only rates him as a top-level domestic, not even a domestic pro in some instances.

I did the same for Daniel Martin's winning ride in the 2010 edition of Tre Valli Varesine, and in it his highest rating (5min) was a mid-level domestic pro.

So I'm taking two things from this.  The first is that the power profile in the software is probably underestimating, and the second is that in a race, power is clearly not the sole deciding factor.

There was some bad marshelling and there was a back up of cars. We decided to go around the cars and went into the corner after the line.

tl;dr I got hit by a car during a race.

**PICS**

[My Steed and I](http://i.imgur.com/j2bKZK7.jpg)

[With My Competition](http://i.imgur.com/rChZbjt.jpg)



Just came back from my first road race at CAT 5, 40 mile race (loop), 21 miles each lap. This was actually my first real ride on the road this year since we literally just came out of a harsh, icy and 6th month long Winter this week in Minnesota.

**Temperature in the 70s,** clear skies and very sunny. As I predicted, I received plenty of funny looks  and  a few snide remarks from snobs about my vintage ride I brought.  Race begins, had a little  trouble clipping in so I had to up the pace a little bit to get back on the tail end of the peloton.  Now in the back I'm finally able to get a chance to get a feel for the group flow.  Moved up a couple positions.  Man are we moving fast, and holy shit does this feel easy!  We were going probably 25-30mph (Didn't have time this morning to install my computer) but it really felt like a very easy, leisurely warmup pace despite how fast we were actually going. It was almost mesmerizing, the unified hum of many hubs and tires on the asphalt. Lots of yelling, mostly ""HOLE!"" and ""SLOWING!"" (Winters here in Minnesota are very harsh on the roads causing many a large cracks and potholes).  Couple close calls of guys slamming on their brakes. After some long miles of straightaways, there were of course 90 degree turns for the next 5 mile straight away and hills, which surprisingly enough I had absolutely no problem sprinting or climbing along the competition.


**About 15 miles in** or so I couldn't find a safe opening, except on the right hand side along the white line.  I'm feeling  very fresh so I go into sprint mode half assedly to move about 10 heads up.. Suddenly someone behind me yells chain. I look down, my chain slid off my front chainrings on the inside, I yell chain myself, move to the right and slow down as I go into a shifting frenzy trying to get the chain to latch on.  Finally got my chain to latch back on but the peloton was already 30-40 meters away. Of course I sprinted after them to catch the rear but it seemed they were very eager to drop a man while hes down.  


**Now dropped**, I'm a lone wolf fighting the everlasting forces of full blast headwinds.  I glance back and see two bikes in the distance closing in on me, dropped guys as well.  They finally catch up to me and I hitch a ride on that train faster than a hobo escaping the five-O.  After a couple minutes of getting my break from the wind I move up a bit and pull.  They couldn't seem to keep pace so they eventually hopped off my train and disappeared back in the distance behind me.  Every few miles I had to readjust my handlebars because all the bumps in the road apparently loosened my stem a bit (Did I mention that I just had this bike overhauled at the LBS not even 2 weeks ago?).  Because of that, me and this fellow in a Motobecane kept Yo-Yoing.  He'd catch up to me, I'd break away, then I had to stop and readjust my bars again and he would pass me, I'd catch up again and leave him a half mile back, Stopped for a pee break, he'd catch up again, and so on and so forth. 


**Eventually** two different breakaways of women passed us, one group of three and another of four, I think they were the Womens CAT 123 group. Blew right past us at a pretty good clip. Had to slow down on some descents because the handlebar misalignment was so bad I  would have gotten seriously injured if I was too rough at this point. Seriously, I LOOOOVE descending as fast as I can but this was outright **sketchy as fuck** with my tire like this **I** and my handlebars like this **/**. There were some pretty long, steep hills towards the end too, which weren't really much of a problem except my legs literally locking/freezing up on the final hill on the last lap. I completed the race though, that's what matters.


**My Excuse** for not thoroughly checking the bike on a long ride as soon as I got it back from the overhaul at the LBS is that it was snowing and freezing rain thundersnowing all the past few weeks here in MN and didn't want to get all the salt on my clean ride I just got back from the shop.  As soon as I got back home from the race I went in to the shop and chewed them out for doing a sloppy job on my ride, embarrassing me and ultimately costing me the race. I handed them my bike and told them to get it done right.  Shop manager was pretty cool about it and understanding.  Still pretty pissed about the ordeal considering the extra few week delay and price.


**Couple Things I learned**

* **1.)** If you want something done right, just do the damn thing yourself.

* **2.)** Thoroughly inspect your ride before the race.. To paraphrase Muhammad Ali, ""It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe.""

* **2.)** I'm a much stronger climber than I previously thought (At my 5'8"", 150lbs frame and 30lb bike) as I would consider myself and my general build that of a natural sprinter.

* **3.)** I need to improve my leg strength and sprint endurance to make sure I can catch the peloton if that happens again.  Not really an issue since I'm naturally a very fast sprinter and endurance was my ultimate weakness so I've been primarily working on my base for one year now.

* **4** I can confidently say I'm too much engine for my wet noodle of a frame of a 1974 Raleigh.  Will be using my much stiffer and lighter [2004 KHS Flite 500](http://i.imgur.com/U6P91v1.jpg) from now on.

* **5.)** A lot of people throw a LOT of money into this sport.

I ask because I've had my rear tire heat up (and puncture from glass that was already in the tire) while following riders down a hill slower than I'd like where lots of braking was required to not run into the back of them.

I have a Garmin Edge 500 and utilize 4 of the 5 data field display pages as follows:

I don't have a speed sensor— I use GPS for speed (but pay approximately .09% attention to it anyway) when riding outdoors and train by my power numbers while indoors. Cadence and Power are set to Zero Avg. and Data Recording is set to, Every Second.

I use screen 2 approximately 95% of the time that I spend training. When my Quarq needs servicing, I'll flip it to screen 4 and entertain myself by pondering the validity of HR numbers. I often find myself wondering what data Pros are looking at on their computers. I also wonder if I could be using my computer more effectively while training. I tend to avoid repeating any data fields among pages, but then I wonder if it might be useful to try.


SSSOOOOOooooooo......

How do you configure YOUR computer head unit? 


How many data pages do you use? 

Do you use auto scroll?

What do you find in/effective about your current configuration? 

What pages do you prefer to use most often? 

Do you have a race specific data field vs a training specific data field?

I don't have any experience with other high powered head units. Don't feel excluded if you're using a Joule/ PowerControl/ something else; please feel free to let us know how you have them set up!

1. On Wednesday I did some speed work on the rollers, Z3 for 10 mins three times, I could hold 285 watts at 110 rpm for all three intervals.
2. On Thursday I did a ""hill climb"" type workout on a fluid resistance trainer, 5 five minute intervals at 85 rpm in Z3. Honestly I expected my wattage to be significantly higher during this workout since I am a strong climber (63 kilos) and my natural cadence is much closer to 85 rpm than it is to 110. Also, I figured the balancing act required on the rollers would eke my hr up a bit too. But this was far from the case: I could barely hold 260 watts on the stupid trainer and my heart rate was right at the cusp of Z4 on the last interval.
3. On the road I am certain I have knocked out 300 watts for 20 minutes before, and at least 350 watts for 10 minutes during a hill climb event last year (based on power profiles of similarly sized people that I beat).

So I am more or less where I'd expect on the rollers, but I am convinced there's something happening on the trainer that makes the numbers so shitty.

If you aren't familiar with it, my understanding so far is that you start with short race pace efforts and slowly build up over the weeks to longer and longer efforts at the same or similar pace. 

My interest in this was spurred on by the fact that, for me, truly long rides are 4+ hours and I can hardly stand more than an hour on the trainer. How does one do base properly in a Cold/rainy/snowy winter? My understanding from Friel is that it is eagerly a low intensity effort with larger time investments. This idea of reverse periodization makes sense from a practical standpoint simply because I do short intense efforts in doors and when roads begin to thaw I'm ready to crank out longer rides outside. 

My research so far on the subject hasn't actually been all that fruitful. I did find some random blog posts saying Wiggins may have used this method, not that I care about that speculation, just what will help me meet my specific road season goals.

Secondly what lacing pattern should be used on a front wheel used for racing and training? Does it matter? I weigh around 68kg, but I worry about wheel stiffness.

So with all that in mind, the question that comes up for me is that of rest days.  

I typically don't have a problem with going 'hard enough' on my 'hard' days.  I ride with a few guys who can legitimately destroy me.  All I need to do is say 'put the hurt on me today' and they're more than happy to do it.  The training benefit of this is, potentially, huge.  But where I run into trouble is figuring out what to do on the days I'm not getting my lungs ripped out of my chest by these monsters.  Often, I find myself in the situation of riding 2-3 hours at 'tempo' pace on Monday, then going out and getting my head hammered off on Tuesday, then going out to my local group ride on Wednesday and barely being able to hang on, even though I *should* be the guy putting the hurt on most of that group.

Then Thursday I'll rest or just commute, and on Friday I'm back to a 2-3hr tempo ride and by the time the race starts on say Sunday morning I'm hardly recovered and can usually do little more than sit in or launch a couple token, feeble attacks.

OK, maybe it's not quite that bad, but when I see people talking about how they do 2 days of FTP work, 2 days of VO2Max work, plus a couple long rides, plus some other stuff... I just wonder how they're fitting it all in without getting totally destroyed and compromising basically all of those workouts.   I've got a good base from years of long-distance triathlon.  I don't typically get 'overtrained' in the classic sense.  But I'd just love for my legs to be a little fresher and suspect I'm not recovering well enough to let the stress of hard sessions really sink in.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_qzhnh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/qzhnh/rvelo_how_do_you_organize_your_rest_days/,

I've used both styles before, and had problems with each. My old round drops were pretty shallow and tiny, which didn't give me much room to move around or gain any variety (which I believe is the reason I hated them, which the larger, deeper Rotundo might fix).

My currently-installed anatomic bars are one of FSA's sharply-angled, [flat-section-in-the-middle type](http://www.bikebaron.com/shop/pc/catalog/FSA8GOBAAK44ex1.jpg), and I'm not a huge fan as it forces my hands onto that one and only spot on the drops. 

Would a larger, round drop bar solve my problems, thus allowing me to change hand positions as I see fit? Or am I just running a cheap bar with shitty ergonomics, and a better-designed anatomic drop would be a better solution?

My hands thank you in advance.

I did my first race the other weekend. Thought I would post the stats for those who were in my shoes and thinking about racing but worried about it (if there are any).

Here are my exports:
http://connect.garmin.com/activity/91412447 (has heart rate)
http://app.strava.com/rides/707790

I messed up my start time and missed resetting the lap timer until 4 min into the race. So, there is ~4 minutes not on the export. 

Race was in Folsom, CA, flat, in a business park - 30 minute total. 

I was worried about racing for a bit, the biggest factor was b/c I am always injured and don't like competing unless I can give it my all. I got over that when I realized I am always injured and will just ride through pain (bum knee - surgery, no meniscus; chronic lower back for 10+ yrs). Secondary factors where: if I could handle the speed I kept reading about, riding in a large group (generally the corning part). 

I've owned a road bike for about 4 years, and for probably 2 I've mostly off the bike b/c of injuries.

I started ""training"" about 1.5 months ago, coming out of a triathlon. I wanted to do triathlons, but I have nerve issues in my foot that keep me from being capable of running ( trying to overcome), also triathlons are expensive!

**Race run-down**: My goal was not to get dropped. It was my first race (cat5). I got there, brought my friends trainer and scratched that and road the course a few times. I lined up to a field of ~45 people, we did a ""practice"" lap first with ride mentors (since this was cat5 race). However, when they asked who've raced before, I was pretty much the only one who didn't raise my hand. A fair amount of older guys who looked pretty prof. and seemed like they raced a 1-2 cat5s a yr (if that ) to avoid moving up :P 

Starting out, I was thinking -- wow, this is pretty easy. I've ridden in groups before but never this big (both deep and wide). So, the lack of wind resistence in the middle of the pack was more than I was expecting. I ended up leading for about 5 laps throughout the race. Wasn't my intention, I just followed someone moving up front and ended up in the front. With 5 laps to go, a team sprinted ahead of me and I decided to conserve as the pack wrapped around me -- thinking, I will conserve for 2-3 laps, then make a move... Well, I ride pretty conservatively, and I ended being stuck in the gutter and I couldn't make any moves. Didn't want to try to move out and cause a crash. So as the last lap approached, I was like fuck-me; I cannot do anything but I've got all this energy left. The finish was right after a decently sharp right turn, so I tried to make a move right after that turn but was stifled as a guy apparently ran out of gas right in front of me and caused me to loose my momentum. At the end of the day I finished 19/~45. Way better than I was expecting -- but kind of disappointing because I felt like I was only giving like 70% for most of the face. 

My heart rate monitor said I was ""working"" hard, but I think it was mostly jitters from the first time. My lactic threshold is ~170 (had it measured), but I felt like I was cruising the entire time. After the race, I wasn't winded or sore.

I would like to make a dynamic leaderboard on our sidebar displaying our best racers.  Problem is, I don't know where to start as far as valuing placings relative to fields, categories, etc.  Does anyone have any ideas as far as a formula or rubric for ranking?

Okay guys, here's where we stand:

BrainInAJar would like weighted values for our 5 categories, with cat 3 as the baseline.

I'm thinking we'll assign points for the top 10 places, regardless of field size.  Our points series in FL doesn't discriminate on field size, so I don't think we should either.  Points will run 15 - 13 - 11 - 9 - 7 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.

One idea Hellvis and I have thrown around is running three categories, A, B, and C.  A = 1/2, B = 3, C = 4/5.  We'll have podiums for top three racers in each category.

From johnybutts: 
The scoreboard should be based from 25 pts for 1st place down to 1 point for 26th place.

It should be category independent - after all a win for a cat 5 feels just as good as a win for a cat 1.

We should separate road, CX, track, and Mtb though.

If y'all feel like those in more southern climbs will race more and therefore have an advantage, only score points for the best 10 races.

I think a mid-season upgrade should also be worth 25 points. And it'd be worth defining the season as Jan 1 through Dec. 31 for road/track/mtb, and whatever the CX season is for CX.

Anyways, those are my thoughts.

I'll be compiling this based on the race results page, so be sure to send them in.

I am right between a 54 and a 56. I am 5'9"", 31"" inseam,  and currently riding the Allez in a 56. The thing is, the stand over height feels a touch too tall, but when riding, the handlebars seem relatively close.  
  
I honestly can't make up my mind. I am leaning towards the 54cm and possibly getting a longer stem for it if the handlebars are too close again, I definitely am aiming for a more aggressive fit. I have done limited test riding on each size frame and it hasn't helped my decision making.

It was on a 2.2KM/1.35M long car track with quite a few curves, 45 minutes + 3 laps. There were about 80-100 riders, and the field was very diverse: people like me, a bunch of amateur elite racers (not sure how it maps to US racing, but I guess you could compare them to cat 1 or 2), and I even spotted a local Olympian.

I came mainly to learn a lot; as long as I wouldn't crash I'd be happy. For the first 20 minutes or so I managed to keep up with the main peloton, but at that point I took a curve too fast, and ended up of the road in the next curve. I tried to accelerate out of it as quick as I could, a guy from my club who was riding  behind me even tried to pace me back, but I didn't manage to catch up anymore. The rest of the race I just tried to keep going at a good tempo, got picked up by 3 others who I rode a few laps with, then the group grew to 8 or 9 and that's how we finished. We got lapped by the main field on the penultimate lap, but I didn't really mind because a club mate was out on an attack with 1 other :). (He didn't manage to keep away though.)

So that's a recap of today, now here's my questions:

- I tried to follow the ideal line, but while still in the peloton I noticed that because so many do the same you end up losing a few spots anyway because there's only so much space. Is it better to ride a slightly worse line, for the sake of not having to brake?

- The tactic I tried to follow is that if most people around me held there legs still for 10 seconds or so (which seemed to happen when an attack got caught), I kept pedalling to move up 10 or 12 spots. The idea behind that being that I'd have less of a elastic band effect if I'd be more forward. I'd usually lose that spot after a while, but win them back on the next moment it slowed than a bit. Is this is a good tactic or is it unnecessary? 

EDIT: 1 more question I just remembered:

- Having been lurking on this sub for a while I've learned that you should keep pedalling as much as possible in curves. However my pedal hit the road twice; only briefly so it didn't have consequences except for me being a bit scared. Any tips on knowing how tight you can take a corner while keeping pedalling, or is it just instinct/experience?",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,1376150609.0,,,True,t3_1k3ani,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1k3ani/just_rode_my_first_ever_training_race_got_2/,

I'm in quite the predicament here. For background: My team, LBS, gives me a 20% off. Of what bikes they have, I have narrowed it down to a Scott Foil 40 (or similar, CR1 is pretty much a Foil, IMHO)  at 20% off. 

Now where it gets complicated is that as a junior, I have access to Argon18 bikes at 30% off (Through a local junior program). I am told that I can get a Krypton for around $1700 (!). 

My teammates are giving me crap for wanting a bike that wont be bought through our Team shop, since we are really encouraged to give them our loyalty, when possible. I really like the Argon, but I feel kinda like a jerk not buying from the shop.

 Do you think it would be okay? Do you think either bike is better than the other? Pros and cons? They are both pretty much the same price for a Foil 40 (although the Foil would cost more), and the Krypton. 

Also if you were to vote for me to go Argon, do you think its worth upgrading to a Galium or Gallium Pro? I want a stiff bike, but a stiff bike is only relative, because I'm only a 110lb Junior. 


For reference, although I cant provide link to the Argon's with prices, These are link to the Scott Foils that I would be buying. Mind that the price you see would be 20% less.

1371412310.0,7,self.Velo,1ggydl,Former runner now cyclist has some questions (plus interesting back story),blatchcorn,7,0,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1ggydl/former_runner_now_cyclist_has_some_questions_plus/,"1)  I am training as per the cyclist's training bible's programme and it recommends if you are new to the sport to only base train for the first one or two years.  I know how important base training is, but If I have experience in other sports can I ignore this piece of advice?

2)  I need to lose about 2 stone.  Doing lots of cycling at the moment means I am burning lots of calories, but is it ok to eat more than usual to keep the calorie deficit sensible?  I often burn off 1000+ calories a day according to my garmin, and eat enough to get around a 700 calorie deficit.

3) I had a bike fit done and it was pointed out that my right knee makes a circular motion. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C1RjSUHrY (left = new bike fit; right = old bike fit).  How can I stop this?

4)  I am 21 years old, and this is a fairly representative example of a current long ride http://app.strava.com/activities/60690268 and am doing 14.5 hours a week.

Given my background, in particular running a 1:22:08 half marathon with a heart defect (now fixed) and not great training, how much potential do you think I have?  Is it completely out of the question to become cat 1/semi pro or even full pro?  In the back of mind I am thinking to myself this is something I could have achieved but am starting too late.

5)  What is the best way to learn about racing tactics other than watching pro racing like the grand tours and classics?

6)  With running, 100 miles per week was considered the standard amount of volume required to get good enough to win races; is there an equivalent in cycling?

7)  In cycling your heart rate varies quite a lot and is much harder to keep constant compared to running.  I am trying to keep my HR between 130-150bpm.  Is it ok to go outside of these parameters as long as the average for the ride is in the correct zone?

Thanks a lot!  I have been a lurker for a while but will start contributing to this community.



Back story (optional reading):
I got into running when I was 17 and trained by myself for a few years and got quite competitive without really being very scientific with, or planning, my training.  I was able to run a 1:22:08 half marathon when I was 19 and off quite little training (under 50 miles per week).

I picked up a bad case of trochanteric bursitis and didn't really do much rehab and took a year to get over it.  I came back super motivated and did some incredible base training to the point where running 95 miles per week 'was so easy' according to my training diary.  I also really educated myself of endurance/running training and adopted team sky's principals of marginal gains and trained with the mind set if I want to be a pro I got to act like a pro, so almost perfected my diet, ice bathed, used compression, foam rollers, core workouts, recovery products.

All going well then a medical nightmare happened.  Long-story short, I got an abscess on my leg that compressed my veins and caused a DVT.  

At that time I had an undiagnosed atrial septal defect, which is essentially a hole in between the two chambers of the heart.  This is bad because it means some of the blood the heart sends to the muscles is deoxygenated, having gone through one chamber to the next and by-passing the lungs.  Therefore aerobic capacity is reduced. 

This blood clot in my leg traveled up to my heart and went through the hole and then up to my brain.  This caused a stroke.  I lost use of my left arm and could not use my mouth properly. I also had delayed reactions.  After being in hospital for two weeks, I made an amazing recovery.  Leg operated on to drain abscess, my heart fixed with cutting-edge key hole surgery and got super lucky to make a 99.99% recovery from my stroke. My baby finger does not have perfect sense of touch but cannot complain about that really.

I trained for a bout 7 months since then but kept getting constant minor injuries (hamstrings, plantar faciitis).  I have always been interested in cycling and have a CAAD10 road bike to cross train on.  

But I have recently decided to ditch running and take up cycling.  I feel like I have sacrificed to much of my life to running and had nothing in return.  I find cycling more fun and running just reminds me of how good I should be by now if it was not for injuries and health issues.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,1371412796.0,,,True,t3_1ggydl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1ggydl/former_runner_now_cyclist_has_some_questions_plus/,

My preferred type of cycling is track however I am essentially on standby for our team's upcoming road series so I will be doing training for distance too.

Looking at the stats from my last crit, which I don't have handy right now, I averaged 174bpm over the ~46 minute rate with a maximum of 195bpm occurring on both the prime and the final sprint. I'm 25 years old.

From the stats I've seen posted in this /r/ from similar level crit racers my heart rate seems unusually high with the majority averaging closer to ~165bpm?

I know that nerves and excitement always push my HR to ~115bpm before I even start the race but even once I'm settled and feeling perfectly fresh with controlled breathing I rarely see below 170bpm.

I'm referring to training yourself to (or naturally) pedal(ing) like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1j1j0ttVPU) and [this](http://www.bicycling.com/training-nutrition/training-fitness/perfect-pedal-stroke).  So specifically, is it advisable to engage muscles during the ""pull back"" phase &amp; lift up phase, and/or employ ankling?


The reason I ask is my physical therapist says my pedal stroke is quad dominated (i.e. the majority of my force occurs during the down stroke and I slack off during the pull back &amp; lift up) and in his experience many of the cyclists he treats for [patella femoral pain syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome) and to some extent, [IT band syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome) (both of which I've managed to incur on myself) also have quad heavy pedal strokes.  (He's also worked with me on bike fit, strengthening glutes &amp; core, stretching, &amp; foam rolling, but I trust that part of the rehabilitation process)


My previous understanding was that you should pedal in a way that feels natural, but given my injuries &amp; PT's advice, it seems like I need to re-evaluate that belief.

* I've upgraded to cat 1/2 this year.
* I've been riding the stock wheels that came with my bike, Ultegra 6700 tubeless, I've noticed a decent amount of flex in the front wheel while sprinting.
* I broke a spoke on the back wheel last weekend, it is going to cost ~$200 to get it fixed (spokes aren't cheap and you can't get them in singles).
* A new ultegra 6700 rear online ~$200. 

So I'm looking at my options $1k is my preferred budget, I don't like buying speed I let my legs do the talking... Fix the ultegra rear and get a race wheelset? suggestions for a good race wheelset for ~$800? Or should I spend my budget on one all purpose wheelset, suggestions? It would have to be clincher so that I don't get stranded somewhere, I don't have a wife support car.

My price range is kinda tight (sub $700-800) and I really don't know too much wheel shopping. Thus far I've found a pair of Eastons and a pair of Mavics that I'm digging...

Suggestions, endorsements anyone??

Many thanks!

[EDIT] I've also just been recommended Zipp 101's. I'm really digging them from the reviews I've seen.

[RE-EDIT] Ok so the front runners right now are...
                -Mavic Ksyrium Elites
                -Williams system 30's 
                -Rol D'Huez wheels",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,True,,,True,t3_plg8u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/plg8u/groovy_wheelsets/,

I'd like to keep it under $500, and I'm open to used frames (though they're hard to come by).

Most of my fellow riders race a lot, or ride how they feel.  Some hire coaches who make goals and training schedules for them, and some make their own goals and ride how they feel geared towards that.  It's hard to tell which is best, since we all seem to be getting faster together.

So what works for you, what hasn't worked for you?

I'll start I guess.  Last year I didn't do any base training, I jumped right into muscular endurance, so by the time I got to my first race, I had tapered too much and lost a lot of fitness.  So I got advice from some athletes and made a new schedule which included racing a lot...  I got slowly better, but I was still lacking the endurance emphasis since I could make good attacks and sprint, but couldn't keep up on hills or keep the pace in breakaways.  So by almost the end of last season (mid July or so) I started doing the build 2 period from the Cyclist's Training Bible as well as putting in monster miles on saturdays (followed by sunday morning crits) and it worked wonders for me.",,False,self,t5_2s4ji,False,,,True,t3_o00rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/o00rz/how_do_you_determine_your_training_schedule_what/,
