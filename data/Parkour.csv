When people have specific questions on progressions or building a conditioning routine or what have you, that deserves a specific response and discussion. On the other hand, fairly regularly we see posts asking blindly for help for a total beginner. It's not bad that these posts exist, by any means, but I think that they would best be helped by something in the sidebar tailored for people starting from nothing.

Has anything appropriate been written already that we should put up a link for? There's the link to APK tutorials, but I'm imaging something a bit broader in scope, i.e. talking about how to train safely and how to recognize good places to train.

Next, let's confirm some things.  We are a group of traceurs and aspiring traceurs, yes?  And we aim to encourage as many people as we can to become a part of this community, yes?  So why are we downvoting amateur videos simply because it's amateur?  [Take this post from earlier today](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1f4ibw/a_video_my_friends_and_i_made_a_while_back/) as an example.  Granted there are a few things wrong with this clip (poorly shot/edited, short, generic music) but you can plainly see that they are serious about parkour.  Is downvoting a video justifiable by saying that the *video itself* is poorly made?  That post recieved two upvotes and *seven downvotes*!  Not only that, but no comments whatsoever!  If you're downvoting because you think their technique is off, then please tell them so in the comments so that they can improve!  How do you expect people to improve or *want to improve* if they are just laughed at without being given any constructive criticism?

This isn't the only case, and it seems that any amateur video is downvoted to absolute shit.  As long as the video isn't about making fun of parkour or something completely irrelevant, it shouldn't be downvoted without explanation.  This is not what we're about and we should be encouraging everyone, *amateur and professional*.",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_1f4yo2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1f4yo2/could_someone_please_explain_to_me_something/,

Thing is what's usually really happening at this stage is security got a call, they don't have any protocol to follow and they'd rather play it safe. In my case this is the first encounter they'd had with a traceur. I asked around to figure out who i'd have to talk to for permission and set up an appointment. I just got out of it, the school's fine with it, they just ask that I try not to do any damage to the school. If people are interested they said they'd even be fine with setting up a club.


tl;dr
Security doesn't have the final word. If you get kicked from a campus take it up the chain of command.

This is my beginner traceur/traceuse resource post. I pretty consistently update, modify, and repost it in various short forms around /r/parkour and I'll keep doing so, but this is something you can link to when the next wave of new potential traceurs comes through the subreddit asking how to start. It is **not** meant to be a comprehensive post about parkour, but it should nudge you in the right direction (Spoiler alert: Outside, not the internet, is the right direction). Get it? **Reading this will give you an idea of what you can start doing today to be considered a parkour practitioner from here on out.**

**First off**, if you have the option to train with other people who already know what they’re doing, do it. Now. No excuses. No youtube. Go find them, buy them food, and hang out with these people. They’ll take care of you. 

**If you don't have a group to plug in with** from the start because you can’t find one or you’re terrified of social interaction, I suggest checking out these resources to get some of the basic techniques down. Better yet, go find three like-minded friends and have them go through these resources *with* you. Don’t send them a link. Go get them, feed them, and go through everything together in person. You’re going to be a lot more excited to go out and train if you’re not hitting the pavement alone. I promise.

**Let’s talk shop!**

Here is the reality of beginning parkour: You can go out on Day 1 and, assuming you're reasonably fit and healthy, perform virtually all of the basic parkour techniques. Practicing parkour isn't so much about trying to learn that new advanced technique as it is to combine and tweak very basic techniques in long sequences.

It really helped me when I was just starting out to make a formal list of 5 techniques that I wanted to master and then drill them purposefully for a couple months. Otherwise, I knew I'd catch myself nailing things once or twice and considering them mastered if I didn't artifically limit my pace. **Parkour is a lot about fine body control.** It takes time to truly train your body to perform how you want it to. It's going to be tempting to walk outside, read safety vault on your handy dandy little list, step over something and say you've mastered it. You haven't. And you're going to be sorely disappointed when you go to your first jam and realize you know nothing. You need to play with those basic techniques until you've made them your own. More on this later.

**But what about flips?**

What about flips? If you want to learn them, go learn them. It will challenge your body and mind. That's good. If you ever see anything labelled 'Parkour vs. Freerunning' avoid it like the plague. If you don't and I see you mixed up in some stupid debate about the delineation of the two, that's bad.

**But where can I train?!? D:**

* Outside: Local fitness trails, playgrounds without children, nature, man-made things.

* Inside: Open gymnastics gyms, your living room.

If you can jump on or near it without breaking anything, getting shot at, or being asked to lave, you can train parkour there. People make this complicated for no reason whatsoever.

**What should I spend my time doing?**

Work on the microscale and work on the macroscale.

The Microscale: 

* Individual techniques. We discussed this above. Choose a few and get to work on them.

* Stay fit to keep doing the things you love, not just for the sake of being fit. Pay attention to your whole body and your mental health. Be positive. Put good things in your body. Get outside and do things. Read this: [Fit for a Purpose](http://www.parkourgenerations.com/article/fit-purpose). Check out some [Demon Drills](http://www.youtube.com/user/DemonDrills) and [nature challenges](http://www.youtube.com/user/Obsidian1138/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0) for ideas on bodyweight drills. Learn to planche. It's fun. Too easy? Get over to [/r/bodyweightfitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness). and learn all the good things we discuss over there. Look at [Beast Skills](http://www.beastskills.com/), feel jealous, and get on that guy's level. Think you've reached the peak of human strength already? [I guarantee you have not](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuxcbB_nIh4). Consider taking up [barefoot running](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo).

The Macroscale:

* This is where many traceurs fall short. Everybody spends so much time focusing on specific moves and short sequences, that they forget **the ultimate goal of parkour - to get from one location to another as quickly and efficiently as possible.** Not from one location to another, conveniently close location. ANY location to ANY location. Make it a game. Choose somewhere on the horizon and get there in as straight a line as possible. Do this regularly.

**MY PARKOUR PHILOSOPHY**

This is what I would tell you if I knew you in person.

* Buy yourself a halfway decent pair of tennis shoes (I like Onitsuka Tiger's Ultimate 81s. Read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/12ztt9/five_finger_shoes/c6zpq28) if you're interested in [minimalist shoes](http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/10kh89/tried_slacklining_for_the_first_time_yesterday/c6ec3kb).) and some walmart/target/cheap loose fitting sweatpants with a drawstring and then don't think about gear again. **You don't need anything to start parkour.** If you feel the need to buy something, get a $20 pullup bar to throw in the doorway of your room. Max out your reps every time you go in and out.
* Go try techniques out for yourself. Don't rely on the internet for your information. Go do things! The human body is awesome. Use it. Experiment to find out what works and what doesn't. You'll increase your body awareness in so many ways. **Any activity becomes creative when the doer cares about doing it right or better.** Movement can be an insanely fulfilling expression of art.
* Always keep drilling the basics. Over and over again. Can you safety vault like a pro? Great! Now make sure you can do it on both sides and control the distance you're vaulting. Work to double that distance. Now link it to two other moves. Can you do those on all sides? Can you do them barefoot at 3AM when it's pouring rain? This is what it takes to truly master a set of skills. Sure, you might be physically strong enough to front flip 10 foot gaps within a month of starting your training, but should you? I'd say no every time. [Parkour Generations](http://www.parkourgenerations.com/article/dilution) has some fantastic things to say on the subject.
* Innovate. Bring in aspects of your other pursuits. Cross pollination encourages growth. I'm big into skateboarding, so I always try to spend some time bringing aspects of that pursuit over to parkour. Parkour with a skateboard? Why not! Climbing has helped my parkour immensely.
* Keep jamming with people that are better than you. They'll push you to improve and teach you new things. Plus, traceurs are universally awesome people to hang out with. Don't know when any jams are? We've got traceurs from all over the world in this subreddit. We'll hook you up. [Universal Parkour](http://www.universalparkour.com/parkour-groups/) also has a resource, albeit an incomplete one.
* Add to the community. Are you good at video editing, writing, photography, being friendly, etc? Take those skills, put them toward parkour, and give back to the community so we can grow it. I can kind of write and I enjoy organizing my thoughts through writing. You get cool guides out of it. It's a win-win.
* Enjoy every second of training.
* Share your passion. People won’t retain everything you tell them, but they will remember the things you are excited about.
* **Subtle awesomeness is sexy.** Train for your own personal edification, not public props.

**I KEEP GETTING HECKLED/PARKOUR IS TOO HARD/SOME MINOR ASPECT OF MY BEING THAT I'VE OVERJUSTIFIED AS A MAJOR LIFE ISSUE IS HOLDING ME BACK**

My team has adopted the practice of yelling ""WALKING!"" and give our best exaggerated impressions of that when passerbys try to emulate the scene in The Office and yell ""PARKOUR!"". It's super effective.
Don't be so sensitive. Yelling in passing is nothing.

Reality: Excuses don't make you feel good when you get up in the morning. Get out and do stuff. I know it's hard and you feel like everything has to be perfect for you to make the jump into something new, but it doesn't. Movement is movement. And sitting around waiting for a year for the perfect conditions makes for a really lame life story if parkour is really what you want to do.

**How do I know how I'm doing?**

* Ask yo' buddies, punk.
* Find some [Challenge series]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/x1ed8/proposal_subreddit_bimonthly_parkour_challenge/) or crazy [rail balance challenges](http://blane-parkour.blogspot.com/2012/01/1-mile-of-rail-balance.html). Better yet, make up your own stuff and share with the community.
* Check out this [Skill Standards Resource](http://eatmoveimprove.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Skill-Standards.pdf)
* **Keep a training notebook!** I think this is the best idea ever and will be doing a series of resources on this practice in the near future.
* Hit up /r/ParkourTeachers . Ask questions.

**AND FINALLY!**

1338160285.0,52,self.Parkour,u7vkl,A proposition for this subreddit re: parkour/freerunning.,lethalbeef,56,4,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/u7vkl/a_proposition_for_this_subreddit_re/,"Obviously there's an issue between whether or not so-called freerunning links should be posted on this subreddit, as it is labeled r/parkour, and there is an ongoing debate over whether or not freerunning should be subsumed under this subreddit.

Personally I don't find the ""solution"" of banishing all freerunners to a separate subreddit (r/freerun) to be effective at all. New users will not understand the dynamic or will be overzealous about it, it creates a dichotomy that may be excessively partisan, and it does nothing to promote the understanding of the disciplines or the principles behind things because it stifles discussion and attempts to keep traceurs from learning from freerunners and vice versa.

I think the real problem is not that people don't understand that a perceived difference exists. I think the problem is in essence, two things:
1) Some people (sometimes) are not interested in seeing the various innovations/integrations that we find in freerunning videos, they are only in this subreddit looking for videos, etc that focus on power and speed.
2) Some people are disappointed that after the effort it has taken to create a dichotomy/understand the terminology, the main subreddit about parkour does not seem to be respecting that in the links that are submitted.

My proposition is that, instead of trying to put freerunning links in a corner (r/freerun has 300 subscribers and infrequent links, let's share the love), we can put both of the issues described above to rest by labeling links and videos that are submitted to this site. So we could create guidelines for this subreddit (better formed guidelines should exist anyway) for placing tags on links, namely **[pk]** or **[fr]** in order to clearly demarcate what is going on. 

For now, I think we should test this out on videos only, because they probably cause the biggest stir. If it works well and seems like it'd be effective, we might want to label other things, or think of other labels and guidelines. Hopefully this can lead to a more structured, reasonably organized, self-regulating community.

Again, this is an initial proposition. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts or suggestions on this. No implementation yet.",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_u7vkl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/u7vkl/a_proposition_for_this_subreddit_re/,moderator

1302996590.0,41,self.Parkour,grqnd,Tips on dealing with security - From a security guard,yugosaki,43,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/grqnd/tips_on_dealing_with_security_from_a_security/,"Hey, I'm a traceur who also happens to work security, so I have a perspective of ""the security issue"" from both sides, figured I'd give you guys my take on it.

First and foremost, there are two basic types of security guard you'll encounter: the kind who are just doing their job and don't actually care (i.e. me) and the kind that are just jerks, you can usually tell them apart by the tone they take with you right off the bat.

When dealing with the second type, generally the best course of action is to calmly and quickly GTFO. In my experience, these are terrible guards who don't know the limits of their authority. I have personally been attacked (no injury) by one of these guys, not worth dealing with. Don't run, but make it clear you are leaving.

When dealing with the first type, be as polite as possible, and don't make sudden movements (we could be on edge if there is a group or something, lots of idiots like to take a swing at us) Generally the guard will just ask you to leave, and nothing more. It may be helpful to ask where the boundaries to the property are if you don't know, as encountering the same guard multiple times in a day will look really bad for you. I have had smartasses (no traceurs yet) think they were clever by just going to another part of the property, thinking they'll avoid me. If I catch the same person 3 times in the same day, I usually nail em for trespassing.

If you are in a group, only have ONE person approach the guard. A group swarming the guy will ramp the tension through the roof. It's a good idea to just have everyone stay put until the conversation with the guard is over.

In general, we do not like calling police, and most of us either can't or don't want to make arrests, so being polite and complying will avoid this nastiness altogether.

DON'T RUN. If I don't know exactly what you were doing, and you run when I show up, I'll assume you were up to something and give chase. Even if I don't catch you, I'll be logging your description and preserving any CCTV footage I have. If something comes up later and you happen to match the description, it could cause issues for you. If you don't run and leave quietly, I'll log the incident, but probably not the details, or bother pulling footage or anything.

Quite often we're only confronting you because we have to. Please don't give us a hard time. You'll notice training around an entrance will often get more negative attention than say, a loading dock. Yes, I know good stuff is usually around an entrance, but if you're not immediately visible/""in the way"", i would be less inclined to confront, and probably won't receive complaints from people.

If someone gives me a hard time, I'll be more inclined to be harder on them the next time I see them (i.e. I won't turn a blind eye, I'll hand out ban notices, etc) When someone is a jerk to me I don't want them anywhere near the people I'm responsible for.

It's also important to note whether you're on private or public property. I can kick you off of private property without any reason at all. Public property (depending on where you are) there generally has to be a reason to deny you access. I suggest looking up your city's bylaws governing use of public property.

Keep an eye out for signs that say ""no trespassing"" or anything like that, and try not to hop any fences to gain access to the property. Even if you're caught, we normally just escort you out, but (at least in my area) most guards can arrest trespassers and hand them over to police. At least according to Canadian law, it's not trespassing unless there are posted notices, you defeated a barrier (like a fence), or you are informed you are trespassing by someone.

Hope that helps out some, any questions?",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_grqnd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/grqnd/tips_on_dealing_with_security_from_a_security/,

[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/grqnd/tips_on_dealing_with_security_from_a_security/)

&gt;Hey, I'm a traceur who also happens to work security, so I have a perspective of ""the security issue"" from both sides, figured I'd give you guys my take on it.

&gt;First and foremost, there are two basic types of security guard you'll encounter: the kind who are just doing their job and don't actually care (i.e. me) and the kind that are just jerks, you can usually tell them apart by the tone they take with you right off the bat.

&gt;When dealing with the second type, generally the best course of action is to calmly and quickly GTFO. In my experience, these are terrible guards who don't know the limits of their authority. I have personally been attacked (no injury) by one of these guys, not worth dealing with. Don't run, but make it clear you are leaving.

&gt;When dealing with the first type, be as polite as possible, and don't make sudden movements (we could be on edge if there is a group or something, lots of idiots like to take a swing at us) Generally the guard will just ask you to leave, and nothing more. It may be helpful to ask where the boundaries to the property are if you don't know, as encountering the same guard multiple times in a day will look really bad for you. I have had smartasses (no traceurs yet) think they were clever by just going to another part of the property, thinking they'll avoid me. If I catch the same person 3 times in the same day, I usually nail em for trespassing.

&gt;If you are in a group, only have ONE person approach the guard. A group swarming the guy will ramp the tension through the roof. It's a good idea to just have everyone stay put until the conversation with the guard is over.

&gt;In general, we do not like calling police, and most of us either can't or don't want to make arrests, so being polite and complying will avoid this nastiness altogether.

&gt;DON'T RUN. If I don't know exactly what you were doing, and you run when I show up, I'll assume you were up to something and give chase. Even if I don't catch you, I'll be logging your description and preserving any CCTV footage I have. If something comes up later and you happen to match the description, it could cause issues for you. If you don't run and leave quietly, I'll log the incident, but probably not the details, or bother pulling footage or anything.

&gt;Quite often we're only confronting you because we have to. Please don't give us a hard time. You'll notice training around an entrance will often get more negative attention than say, a loading dock. Yes, I know good stuff is usually around an entrance, but if you're not immediately visible/""in the way"", i would be less inclined to confront, and probably won't receive complaints from people.

&gt;If someone gives me a hard time, I'll be more inclined to be harder on them the next time I see them (i.e. I won't turn a blind eye, I'll hand out ban notices, etc) When someone is a jerk to me I don't want them anywhere near the people I'm responsible for.

&gt;It's also important to note whether you're on private or public property. I can kick you off of private property without any reason at all. Public property (depending on where you are) there generally has to be a reason to deny you access. I suggest looking up your city's bylaws governing use of public property.

&gt;Keep an eye out for signs that say ""no trespassing"" or anything like that, and try not to hop any fences to gain access to the property. Even if you're caught, we normally just escort you out, but (at least in my area) most guards can arrest trespassers and hand them over to police. At least according to Canadian law, it's not trespassing unless there are posted notices, you defeated a barrier (like a fence), or you are informed you are trespassing by someone.

&gt;Hope that helps out some, any questions?",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_opyz0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/opyz0/tips_on_dealing_with_security_repost_thought_itd/,

Many moons ago I was a breaker (b-boy, break dancer, take your pic of terms) and I slowly found that I hated the competitive nature of it. I didn't want to do better then other people, I wanted to do better then myself. Allow myself to be creative and original. Find that creativity in me, and for a long time I did. After a time though it became about being better then them, our crew over them, my style over his/hers/theirs, and I hated it. That is what drew me to parkour and freerunning. Its personal expression. The ability to push your own limits and to find the most efficient ways for you. What I'm starting to see more and more of though is this idea that it should be a competition. The moment it becomes about being better then others then to me parkour has lost its meaning. To me it has always been about pushing yourself and helping others find their own limits. I can run into a group of runners or trickers and they seem to be more interested in what they can learn from you then doing it better. I don't want parkour to lose that community feeling and acceptance that many other practises have. Who else feels that by adding competition and adversary outside yourself and your own will will eventually turn parkour/freerunning into another x-games cash cow?

Some of the founders of parkour came over from france to lead a seminar. When asked about the difference of parkour and freerunning they basicly said what you call it does not matter. Train how you want and what you want to do. That is what is most important, not what you call it.

We talked about this concept a few weeks ago and I'd like to start implementing it as of today. As the updated sidebar states, we are asking everyone to please include a tag for all videos links submitted to this subreddit so as to distinguish what type of training is being displayed.

Please include the tag [PK] at the beginning of your link title to mark it as a video that primarily exhibits movement that is fast, powerful, practical, and versatile - especially in the sense of navigating environments.

Example: [\[PK\] Fun challenges in some amazing looking spots in New York](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdEdT5Aebw)

Please include the tag [FR] to the title of video links that display parkour movements in conjunction with techniques from other disciplines, such as tricking, dance, gymnastics, extreme wheelbarrowing, and others.

Example: [\[FR\] Incredible creativity and flow from Poland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S81VqFQ2qQ)

Of course, it is going to be very difficult in some cases to make a solid classification, but I hope that if we do our best it will at least be helpful. Don't bicker about the tagging in the comments - if it is so bad that it upsets you, just downvote! Just because something has a single flip in it doesn't mean that it isn't a [PK] video. If someone posts a video that isn't tagged, feel free to remind them in the comments.

As always, please be descriptive in your titles! For now, this is still a small subreddit and we do not need gimmicky titles to attract attention to links. Hopefully good titles and tagging can help  us be a community that is inclusive of all parkour-related movement without being ignorant of the conversation regarding the definition of ""parkour.""

Note that for now this is just for tagging video links.

Thanks!

Some of them are more freerunning based, but I find there's a lot of overlap skill-wise and that they're still worth watching.

**EDIT:** Adding in all additional links. Thanks everyone who is contributing!

**EDIT II:** Throwing in some more specific categories. Let me know what you think.

If there's interest, I can further differentiate the categories by rough skill level, production values, etc. Also, I'm not intimately familiar with all of these channels, so only take the categories I've given as a guideline.

* Storror caused some media fury earlier in this week with [some stunts like this](http://redd.it/1i4m4p). How do you feel about it? Is climbing privately owned cranes a legitimate training exercise or should they be looking elsewhere?
* Are you doing a Parkour 365 or similar project? Share it [in this thread](http://redd.it/1i32es0) for some subreddit subscription love.
* What have been some of your biggest jumps? [Check out this thread to vaguely visualize jumps based off definitely not exaggerated numbers](http://redd.it/1i69hu).

* There were a ton of great videos shared this week, but I'm only going to call attention to a few of them, because they're still right there to be scrolled to, if you're into watching hours of video.

* The Ampisound Video Challenge is [turning out some great stuff](http://redd.it/1i8i6u). I'm not sure what about this video drew me to it exactly, but it's worth a watch.

* Katie McDonnell tears it up [in her new sampler](http://redd.it/1ig2bf).

* Dodo Freerunning made us all jealous of [their backyard set up](http://redd.it/1ifh17) with this footage.

* An epic handstand picture contest went down this week. Check out /u/NickVeraldi 's triggger post [here](http://redd.it/1i8sun).

* /u/Infamise countered with [this picture](http://redd.it/1iaiu3)

* /u/humanlimbspool continued the trend with [this](http://redd.it/1ibcti)

* /u/brickardparkour rounded out the week with [his entry](http://redd.it/1id69o).

* Just kidding. /u/ApathyVeteran snuck in this morning with [this picture](http://redd.it/1ilpmb)

* Get psyched out over dive kongs? [So do these folks](http://redd.it/1i9ueq). Check in for some advise.

* [This thread discusses some options for sweats](http://redd.it/1iae5r) to accommodate the heat. I""ll save you some time. It boils down to this: Go to store, buy pants.

* Increasing the height of your lazy vault? [Definitely possible](http://redd.it/1ii6tf).

/u/Jake_of_all_Trades [offered good reasons for implementing OPTION 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1f55ay/discussion_post_please_upvote_should_we_keep/ca6x35l), but it isn't possible to keep such a change consistent for all users, and there exists keyboard shortcuts to upvote and downvote entries.

Hi my fellow traceurs, an idea of making this post has gone to my mind quiet a time before. How do people who train parkour deal with drugs? Mainly with alcohol, tobacco and cannabis? In czech, IMO most of traceurs here dont smoke, however there are some who do (lets say 20%) . However, there are quiet lot people who do drink alcohol regularly. Or more accuratly, i know only few guys who dont drink alcohol at all (like me). So, i would say 80-90% of traceurs here drink alcohol. But know comes the funny thing. Marijuana usage. In czech alone, we have pretty big cannabis culture. I think some researches claim that we are the number one in cannabis use of young people in Europe. So there is a lot of people who smoke like few times a month, but now that much people who smoke every day. In czech parkour community, i think that there is 15-20% of traceurs who smoke few times a week (including me). Then about 50% who smoke rarely and the rest are people who dont smoke at all and/or think cannabis is dangerous. Those people who smoke regularly , are by no means ""weaker"" in parkour/freerun then anyone else. Even in our main pk group i know about 4 guys. We train just as hard, sometimes harder then people who dont smoke.

See what's up with the subreddit and ask beginner questions here today!",rogueoperative,29,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1fehl9/friday_new_traceur_thread_for_may_31_2013_see/,"Woah! I woke up and realized it was Friday already. This is the summer of strength training and that's been knocking me out stone cold at night, but I've had my morning protein bar and downed a glass of ice cold water now, so let's get this started!

**Notable Threads from the Past Week**: 

Get an idea what's been going on this week!

* **TOP NEWS** [/r/parkour moderator nominations are now open!](http://redd.it/1f7ssq) Make sure you head over there to see the direction the subreddit is heading and put in your two cents. This matters people. Vote!

* [Should /r/Parkour remove downvotes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1f55ay/discussion_post_please_upvote_should_we_keep/).

* This digs slightly into last week's treasure trove, but Apex Movement's Ryan Ford posted [an awesome resource on bodyweight exercises](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1eutlj/top_10_bodyweight_exercises_for_intermediate/). I'm a big proponent of these. Try mixing some into your weekly training.

* [The good old ""What shoes do I wear?"" thread showed up near the beginning of the week.](http://redd.it/1ey4aw)  Not a particularly auspicious start to the week, but there was a small discussion there with some valuable information.

* /u/lTlonster nailed his first [gainers](http://redd.it/1eztfp) this week **and** posted a nifty gif of his doing so. Make sure to give him some props for mastering a tricky move!

* [This](http://redd.it/1f267q) video about Parkour practitioners in Spain didn't get much love, but I thought it was worth a watch. It definitely helps to know some Spanish to get the most out of it.

* A short discussion cropped up mid week about [refining front flips](http://redd.it/1f2q2r). There's always traceurs that are going to shun them from their training, but, hey, you know they look pretty awesome and learning them is an excellent way to gain aerial awareness.

* A thread by /u/PepsiSpice confirmed [what the world already knew](http://redd.it/1f3q9d).  Some people occasionally train parkour by themselves.

* Omar Zaki of Impulse Freerunning posted this [sweet video](http://redd.it/1f9s3r) of freerunning in Dubai. This is right after a  nifty video of him [solo training in a local gym](http://redd.it/1f546y). Support the smaller name traceurs, guys! He's producing regular content and it's damn good stuff, let's give him some views.

* A recent thread that could use some love about [backyard workouts](http://redd.it/1f7yr9) discusses some equipment you could build yourself to train on.

* Go compare scars in [this thread about common injuries](http://redd.it/1f8wig)

* Check out Beast Coast 2013 via [these images](http://redd.it/1f9qhv).

* Darn it, people. I thought we were over [this shoe thing](http://redd.it/1fc5pw).

**So what's this thread for?**

This thread is a judgement free zone for new traceurs to ask all those questions they're wary of making a new thread for. Upvote every question and offer your experience and advice without any of that casual snippiness we like to welcome the newbies with during the rest of the week. Safety. gear. techniques, training, injury - it's all fair game for questions here!

1365329653.0,23,self.Parkour,1buhic,I made a new subreddit that could include quite a bit of parkour and free running,,29,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1buhic/i_made_a_new_subreddit_that_could_include_quite_a/,"I'm subscribed to many of the major sports subreddits and I just recently subscribed here. I've found the videos or highlights to be some of my favorite content, especially of parkour. So I thought that it might be cool to group the best videos into one place and make a sort of highlight reel of human athleticism. It's called /r/athleticfeats

I'm just learning about parkour and I don't know much background. I'm looking to feature it pretty prominently on the subreddit because it takes so much physical skill. 

So basically my idea is to get the best parkour videos or the best videos from any sport really and to group them all into one subreddit. I'm looking to make a Sportcenter Top 10 but with a lot more content and from a lot more sources. I've posted everything from monster dunks to free diving and I'm looking to include more parkour. 

The concept is to find a cool video, post it in the sub or cross post it and then users can watch highlights and then be provided with a link to the sub that specializes in that specific sport or discipline. 

Feedback is appreciated so let me know what you think. ",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_1buhic,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1buhic/i_made_a_new_subreddit_that_could_include_quite_a/,

I started it up last year, but took a summer vacation and when I came back I wound up having a full time job (as a call center technician. Ick.) Anyway, I wound up getting out of Parkour and such, but just recently I quit my job, and started going to practices with the only two guys in my area that do any Parkour and Freerunning. However, they're both strongly the ""Mentor"" types, and I'm more of the ""beginner"" level, so they feel the need to coach me. Which is all well and fine, but they tend to show off their skill level in comparison to my obviously-much-lower skill level, saying how ""Easy"" it is, how I should be able to do absolutely everything they know how to do already. It's a huge turn off to the whole feel of Parkour to me. So, here's the question /r/Parkour, is it better to study videos, read up on techniques, and go out and practice by yourself? Or is it better to have someone there with you, teaching you and showing you, but in the most ass-hat way?

Life was meh, school was boring, and I just felt meh. I decided to go out and just let loose. I started just doing some precisions and some vaults and started to wind down. I started thinking about parkour as more than just a physical thing. 

Physically, parkour is using your environment to overcome obstacles in your environment. I then remembered that one is supposed to live this out in their life. So, my environment is my past experiences and knowledge. I'm supposed to use this to overcome the problems I have in my life and just keep going on my way from here to there.

Once I realized this, everything I did had a whole new meaning to it. Not landing a precision reminded me of a time I messed up in my past. Moving on and forgetting the missed precision, helped me to kind of forget about that screw up. Landing a precision gave a great feeling like I just accomplished something great in my life. I just kept going last night for like 20 minutes and I felt at peace with myself.

The parkour subreddit currently has enough subscribers that we could probably maintain a user generated series of exercises.

This kind of thing will be great for all traceurs who frequent this subreddit (and it'll be a way to get you guys off the computer and doing at least a bit of training), but more importantly, it'll be a really good way for beginners to find a direction to start their training. We often respond to the question of ""how do I get started"" with ""just do parkour, you'll get conditioned through practice,"" but it can still be very confusing to figure out what exactly should be done.

I know I was outside running and jumping on things everyday this week. I've been challenging myself to see how many obstacles I can find in a typical, lawn and fenced yard, suburban neighborhood. Turns out, quite a few if you can be creative with storm drains.

Note that there were some sweet videos that are worth going back to by brute scrolling, as I'll only highlight a few here.


**This Week (Abridged)**

* Our resident shoe expert, /u/Zullwick, weighed in on whether shoes [should have a heel to toe drop](http://redd.it/1io5jx) earlier in the week. All three of his posts in the thread are worth reading if you're curious about what you strap onto your feet at all.
* /u/The51Cents shared [this t-shirt design](http://redd.it/1iq0v8) which looks enough not like a kong vault to cause me to snort so hard milk came out my nose.
* Freeflow Academy in Rocklin, California posted up it's [demo video](http://redd.it/1iq52u). Always worth taking a look at those, especially if you're within driving distance.
* This one initially got caught up in the spam filter, but /u/ryandemonford made a nifty guide to the [step vault](http://redd.it/1itqnz). This caught my attention because I kind of phased out step vaults in my training in favor of more powerful feeling alternatives, but his step vaults look clean and strong. It's pushed me to revisit them.
* Are you training with longevity in mind? Has that even ever occurred to you? /u/kellock71 shares his [thoughts on the matter](http://redd.it/1iuftf). Highly recommended read.
* The [71-year old freerunner](http://redd.it/1itosk) is a big deal this week. for good reason. Glad to see more quality content coming from the FLOW network. Definitely keeping up with them.
* Dodo Freerunning is fast becoming one of my favorite teams to follow. [Check out their latest and greatest](http://redd.it/1iwoio) and feel a little jealous of their skills.
* Ampisound is still at it with their video challenge. [Check out their recent video, put together in 24 hours](http://redd.it/1j0pzs).
* Although I always recommend asking a doctor or actual fitness instructor for help on getting cut, this thread on [parkour conditioning](http://redd.it/1ixl2q) showcased some of our members knowledge on the subject in a good way. Hats off to /u/JedaiMustang for his well thought out post.

**As always**

This thread is a judgement free zone for new-ish traceurs to ask all those questions they're wary of making a new thread for. Upvote every question and offer your experience and advice without any of that casual snippiness we like to welcome the newbies with during the rest of the week. Safety. gear. techniques, training, injury - it's all fair game for questions here! **Have at it and feel free to continue posting here throughout the week!**

Everyone, please upvote all questions!

Let us know how we can follow your progress!,rogueoperative,29,10,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1i32es/doing_a_365_let_us_know_how_we_can_follow_your/,"It occurred to me last week that there are probably dozens of people on this subreddit currently pushing through the middle months of a parkour 365. If you're not familiar with 365 projects, they're essentially just personal projects where a person commits to an activity once a day everyday for an entire year. You see it all the time with photographers o tumblr. Most of the traceurs that have committed to training everyday are producing monthly videos or daily/weekly blogs of their progress.

So share your channel or blog if you're currently doing a 365! I have a lot of respect for committing to something like this and would love to see I the subreddit can support your progress in any way, whether that's through some channel subscriptions or feedback on technique.

If you are interested in doing a 365, but haven't started because of the intimidating time commitment, keep an eye out for a forthcoming month long challenge that I will be issuing soon. 30 days of training with some corresponding blogging or resource creation.
Yay!

Climbing trees and hopping fences and rolling off always seemed to come naturally. Anyway, I recently have gotten somewhat depressed and stopping practicing for two reasons. One is that where I live, NO ONE does Parkour. Ever. My friends won't try because either they're scared they will hurt themselves or they are scared they will get embarrassed. Secondly, there really isn't anywhere to practice. I know this is cliche, but honestly. There are tons of places to practice SINGULAR skills, like repeating cat leaps and vaults, etc., but there isn't any appearant place to go on full runs, and recently I've hit a plateau because of this. Any tips would be immensely appreciated.

Tl;Dr: how do you practice fluidity in Parkour with no one and nowhere to practice?

I made a couple guides and link compilations that I hope you guys have found useful, but now I'm looking to other subreddits for ideas. 

/r/climbing does a very successful [New Climbers Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/1eyuw2/friday_new_climber_thread_for_march_24_2013/) every Friday, highlighting some popular posts from the preceding week and inviting people to ask short questions that they might not be comfortable making a new thread for. It's a simple concept, but it really helps trim down on the repetitive basic questions that would otherwise clog up the subreddit.

Obviously, this will take a bit of work to throw together and it needs to be consistent to be successful. We'll need people in those threads upvoting and replying in a friendly way.

Many new parkour practitioners look online to begin their training.  Unfortunately, most of the time these new practitioners are either lost in a sea of excess information or confused by poorly designed content.  I am here to let you know of a new online resource, Training For Parkour [http://www.TrainingForParkour.org](http://www.TrainingForParkour.org).  It is my hope that this information will be beneficial to newcomers and even those who have been training for a while.

Training For Parkour is led by my good friend Ben Krueger.  Ben has been training for many years now and brings experience he has gained from Parkour Horizons in Ohio, Parkour Generations in the UK, and even some of the founding members of Yamakasi.  More about Ben and his experience can be found on the Training For Parkour website.

As of now, Training For Parkour has five complete lessons up and running along with a few other articles of varying subject.  Some of the topics we have already covered include the parkour warmup, the roll, basic vaults, the importance of control, how to fall correctly, and much more. These lessons are designed to fit every type of learning.  Each lesson has a written portion, downloadable workout outline, and video tutorial to match.  It is our goal to continually provide quality content that is beneficial to everyone.

So if you need help getting started, or need a resource to recommend to friends, please consider [Training For Parkour](http://www.TrainingForParkour.org).  Any questions, comments, or feedback would be greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR** [Training For Parkour](http://www.TrainingForParkour.org) is a new website that provides quality tutorials, articles, and workouts designed for parkour.

This is reddit, it's about user generated content, it's about user interaction, so let's make an FAQ together. I'll be submitting stuff alongside you guys (and maybe if this ends up being a really shitty FAQ I'll just can it and write my own).

**SO HERE'S THE DEAL**: This is going to be similar to the previous call for FAQuestions, but it will be ongoing, hopefully regularly updated. If you have a question about parkour, submit a top level comment in this thread. Only one question per comment. PLEASE check to see that the question has not been asked yet. I will remove repeated questions, etc. Upvote if you agree that this is a question that needs to be answered - particularly if it will be helpful to beginners. And honestly, ""what kind of shoes should I wear"" is a more useful question than ""what are the finer points of distinction between extreme freerunning and ultimate no-limits rage froobling"". Keep in mind that FAQs are for beginners.

**AND THEN** if you have an answer to these questions, feel free to write one! If other people have written answers, you can still add your own. If you like someone's answer, upvote it. There can be many answers to these questions, and that's okay. It's not like anyone is really an ""expert"" on parkour, it's a growing, developing community of practitioners.

**CAVEAT** This FAQ thread is NOT the place for discussion. If you have an opposing view, you are free to post your own answer, but do not argue/oppose others' responses. This thread will consist of questions and individual responses to those questions only, and that will be enforced arbitrarily.

*Answerers*: respond in a descriptive, clear, helpful way. If you don't have a clear opinion, let someone else answer the question. Discussion is not allowed.

It looks like we're back to normal on /r/Parkour. We had a bit of a run in with a banned user who threw a tantrum a little earlier this week. The spam filter and a small squad of mods worked over time to get that junk under control and, after a brief chat with the Reddit admins, it looks like we're good to go. I apologize to everyone who had their threads buried under arbitrary downvotes! We tried to mitigate the damage as much as possible, but I know that even our own comment histories took quite a liberal sprinkling of teen angst from this guy. As another bit of damage, the spam filter is still being wonky and sensitive. If you make a post and it does not show up and it is not of a random butt hole, please let me know and I'll get that sorted out ASAP.

Let's get to this week!

**This Week [Abridged]**

* My favorite article from this week was posted by /u/Joecracko. [Are playgrounds becoming too safe?](http://redd.it/1jkcai). Definitely worth the read.

* /u/h4cklusser posted up his [weekly challenge entry](http://redd.it/1jkw9n) from last week. Keep upvoting this kind of stuff, crew! The more support it has, the more motivation we have to keep putting content together.

* We had a lot of shoe threads this week. I'm not gracing those with any quick links here.

* I had never heard of Ido Portal before [this thread](http://redd.it/1jny5i). Honestly, the guy's movements look awesome, but I'm not getting the feel like he's having a lot of fun while he's defying gravity over there. The general response in the thread was hero worship though, so to each his own.

* /u/Apathyveteran has been doing this cool [Weekly training discussion threads](http://redd.it/1jp2st). Keep following those for some general community stoke.

* Self conscious around more experience traceurs? [It's a pretty common feeling](http://redd.it/1jp422). I liken it to imposter syndrome in graduate students.
 
* /u/personofdoom shared his part of an article for [a local newspaper](http://redd.it/1jpvf5).

* /u/donkeydicksrule also [got a last minute entry in](http://redd.it/1jt08w) for the Weekly Challenge 1. He opened himself up for some technical critiques, which is pretty ballsy, in my opinion.

* **Weekly Challenge #2 is out** [Go try your hand at it](http://redd.it/1jt6zl) and post up your results.

* A thread about hand strength ended up becoming a [great resource on grip strength conditioning](http://redd.it/1ju0pf).

* /u/ApathyVeteran keeps rocking the great question, bringing up a discussion on [parkour purity](http://redd.it/1ju29o). I hate semantics debates, but this one has stayed civil.

* [Calories burned during parkour?](http://redd.it/1jxbcs) The thread didn't get a response, **but I have the numbers for you**! I'll be sharing shortly when I get chance to use the large scanner at work tomorrow. My small scanner made a mess of my calculation sheet.

**As always**

This thread is a judgement free zone for new-ish traceurs to ask all those questions they're wary of making a new thread for. Upvote every question and offer your experience and advice without any of that casual snippiness we like to welcome the newbies with during the rest of the week. Safety. gear. techniques, training, injury - it's all fair game for questions here! Have at it and feel free to continue posting here throughout the week!

**Everyone, please upvote all questions!**

**What went down this week**

* My man [Ryan Ford](http://redd.it/1fk26l) one upped himself with a new resource on improving your climb ups. Check it out!
* [Brooke Bjerke](http://redd.it/1ffi39) posted a video of her training in Brazil. The thread was a pretty good example of how to do constructive criticism right. Worth taking a look at!
* While it was mostly just an ad [Young Pioneers](http://redd.it/1fgiy1) posted up an opportunity to train in North Korea. How awesome would that be?
* [This cat](http://redd.it/1ffgad) was a big deal for a couple of hours for some reason that's beyond me. &lt;-- Dog person.
* [This video](http://redd.it/1fg6h5) can carry it's own weight. No description needed.
* [This thread](http://redd.it/1fh68s) made me aware that Ollo Sapiens are unavailable until August. I've been on the edge about getting them, but this makes sure my money stays in my pocket. I like [the new colors](http://www.ollopk.com/) on their site, but I really want them to ditch the weird sizing scale so I know they'll fit.
* [Team Farang](http://redd.it/1fiyoi) has a documentary up on the FLOW channel. Definitely subscribe to that. They've been producing all kinds of good content.
* [Is all your confidence in your pants?](http://redd.it/1fkvu7). Pretty sure mine isn't, but the rest of the community seems torn.
* [This thread](http://redd.it/1fmmwe) just made me sad. Don't be dicks to the rest of the world, people. Parkour is great, but it's not the end all.
* [Self conscious about training alone?](http://redd.it/1fpf72) so are all these guys. Check this thread out for some advice on how to deal with the gawkers.

**AND MOST IMPORTANTLY!**

* [COME GRILL YOUR NEW MODS](http://redd.it/1fqe0b).

This can serve as a discussion thread for your experiences.

I'll sum up what I've learned through experimentation:

Disclaimer right away - no noises. Never suck in air or push it out with ""conscious force"" (lacking a better term).

Out: Breathing out means relaxing the core. It's crucial for impacts and helpful in explosive movements of all kinds, including but not limited to take-off and landing.

In: In order to breathe in the core becomes tense. This helps you control your limbs while in the air. Caution: Always stop breathing in *well* before an impact or you will be too tense.",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_xixrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/xixrm/breathing/,

Well, today everything clicked.  I went out to train and looked at the table and thought, ""Today is the day."" After about a half dozen tries I had a mental revelation that if I only focused on getting my hands to the far edge of the picnic table, everything else will follow.  

I started running, focused my mind on the spot I wanted my hands to land, and I hit my best kong ever.  I did it five more times with the same result to just make sure it wasn't a freak accident.

That's where you'll come in, you'll write a chapter from a novel in which parkour plays a big role. You're not writing the entire novel (unless you want to), just a single chapter in it, where your hero(es) come to Frederick, MD and meet a local freerunning legend. It will be a challenge, because you'll need to write a chapter that's interesting in its own right but also implies that there's a wider story going on.

Some of the chapters in this novel are transformed into a different genre, and this chapter can be too. If you'd be interested in making it, say, cyberpunk or steampunk themed as well, that's doable. I realize that's a little odd, but it gives you more creative freedom in some ways. I always imagined this chapter being straight-real-world, so don't feel obligated to take this route, but it's an available option.

tl;dr: If you can't read three paragraphs, how are you going to write an entire chapter?",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_nh4fk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/nh4fk/im_putting_together_a_collaborative_novel_with/,

I have NEVER done any gymnastics nor free running nor parkour in my life. I got introduced to it about 2-3 years ago, and it blows my mind

I have been, however, a bit athletic, and have worked out for at least twice a week for my entire life... I have also been into martial arts [tae kwon do, muay thai, boxing, greco-roman wrestling &amp; BJJ] all my life, so my flexibility isn't that bad. 

I have been working out more carefully for the past couple of months, and have gotten into working out almost daily...

Problem is, however, that when ever i see a video about parkour / free running its usually late teens/early twenties [id say 16-24] who are are actively practicing it... never about someone who start at around 28!!!!! Am I too old? Is there hope?

EDIT1: YAY! i'm convinced! I'm off to [this starting page](http://www.americanparkour.com/learn/faq-english/faq/155/887-how-do-i-get-started) and i'll start today... keep you all posted!

* Pavel Kashin passed away this week in a parkour related incident. Share your sentiments [in this thread](http://redd.it/1hstm8).

* /u/Vanillazingzong70 [wants to get another challenge series up and running](http://redd.it/1hvkmj). I'm all for it, but we need you guys to participate to make it worthwhile. Go show him some love!

* [This sampler video](http://redd.it/1hvhfo) blew up the subreddit midweek. Definitely worth a watch.

* Difficulties dealing with police while training? [Check out this thread](http://redd.it/1hxgqq) for some tips on staying friendly with the guys in uniform. It really does make a difference in how the general public views parkour. Rep us well out there!

* [What was the first flip you learned?](http://redd.it/1hzkqd) Go share.

* Why do some people quit parkour? [Go hear their stories!](http://redd.it/1i0u4l) Maybe encourage them to come back into the fold.

I have a challenge for you (the first of many, perhaps?).

I want to see pictures of your training this week, but not just any pictures - no - I want to see you speedvaulting an eagle while F22s fly in formation overhead. I want to see you precision jumping with a fully garnished hotdog in hand and fireworks licking at the soles of your feet. I want to see a moment in time where you have a flag on your pants and patriotism literally pouring from trachea.

Post your picture in the subreddit titled ""Challenge 1: -whatever you like-"". I'll find them all and link them in a giant post at the end of the week. Will there be a prize? Well, maybe. I leaned how to make stickers this week and could probably whip up some sweet custom parkour themed ones and pay the postage out of pocket. It would kind of be like a limited edition trial run. We'll see how it goes.

Basic rules:

* Don't get political. I get it. It's trendy to be loud about guns and religion, but this is not the medium for it.

* Don't get naked, unless you're really, really attractive.
* Don't wear harem pants. They look ridiculous.

If you are not from the US, feel free to still participate! Show us up. Out-patriotism us. I can offer you up to six months of unlimited bragging rights.

The best I was able to do was 20 seconds on my left leg and 17 on my right leg. I was able to walk a few steps as well, but then I would fall. 

Anyway, I was using a rail near a small stone ledge, and there was another nearby. I was using the small stone ledge next to it to get onto the rail, and I was doing precisions from the two stone ledges (only about 5'). So, on one of the precisions, I fell a little short because I was being careless and not thinking, and I landed on the rail, flawlessly. I crouched there for about 2-3 seconds, then once my shock wore of I lost my balance. I feel like it was because my brain caught up. So my question is, how much of balance is all in your head?

**TL;DR I was training rail balance for the first time and unintentionally did a precision to a rail and landed effortlessly. How much of balance is in your head?**",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_15s7xk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/15s7xk/how_much_of_balance_is_in_your_head/,

Howdy,

So I did my first bit of ""actual"" freerunning the other day and I am pretty damn proud of it. I have been training parkour for a year this month somewhere, but have always messed around with flips inside a gym when possible. Went out for a birthday parkour session last week and really felt the urge to try some ""real"" freerunning"".

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I understand that I could've thrown it higher, instead of out so far, but any extra pointers would be awesome.


Hopefully putting more vids up sometime in the near future of regular training etc.",,False,self,t5_2qk85,False,,,True,t3_1201s9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/1201s9/fr_first_catpass_to_frontflip/,

this week, lets try to emphasize conditioning and endurance. we can either:

- do 100 precision at 80% of your max distance with minimal breaks

- plan a long route with at least 8 obstacles and run it in one go

- or, as someone suggested in an earlier thread, work those fast twitch leg muscles by jumping over something waist-high 100 times

for those of you who are just starting out and would rather a more practical challenge this week, ive got you covered:

- do a turn vault to cat, then a 180 from the cat to a shoulder roll.

this sounds a lot more complicated than it actually is. the trick is to break it down into 3 parts (1.turn to cat 2. cat 180 3. shoulder roll) and master each one on its own, then string them together. heres some tutorial vids to get you going:

- turn vault

- rolls
