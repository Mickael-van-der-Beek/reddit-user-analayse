I'm looking for some game suggestions for what seems like a dead/dying genre.  I've been longing for a game that I can play and get completely lost in.  By that I mean that I want to be set loose in a huge world with lots to discover and adventures galore.  I don't want my hand to be held or things to be extremely easy.  I'm not a big fan of leveled enemies or loot.  I don't mind having my ass handed to me by a giant that I shouldn't have messed with.  Games I've played that may be similiar to what I'm looking for are Might and Magic 6, Daggerfall, Morrowind etc.  I want a game that I can get lost in if I'm not careful.  A game where I can spend hours wandering and continue to be enthralled by a huge realized world.  I played Skyrim/Oblivion and some other modern RPG's but I haven't been real impressed by much lately.  I have all current and many old consoles as well as a decent PC setup so just about any suggestions are welcome.  Where should I start my next adventure?

My wife likes to watch me play games like this. 

OK, I'm looking for a good hentai/porn game. The focus is on the word good. I've not liked most of the hentai games I've played. It has to fulfill the following conditions:

1) It should not be so awkward that only a virgin 12 year old will like it.

2) Females should look similar to real human beings. No woman has a boob bigger than double the size of her head.

3) It should not be too much porn with no story. But it shouldn't be too much story with no porn. Both extremes are boring, specially to my wife, because she is only watching me play.

I first used the search the function, but it looks like no one has ever asked for this kind of game in here before. I hope you can help me. Is there a good porn game for adults?

I always get a bit sad when every ""What are some great games I can get for free?""-threads are answered with the same 3 games every time. So I decided to make a list of great freeware-titles *without* Cave Story and friends for once. All of these games are highly enjoyable and I'll try to give a brief explanation of each one. Also, I'm not saying that these games are *completely* unknown. They just deserve more attention. Anyway, have a great summer!

[★★★] = good game

[★★★★] = great game

[★★★★★] = stop everything you are doing right now and download this shit.

*List is not sorted in any way*
_____

**Pixelships** [★★★★] [Link](http://pixelships.com/pxs_details.html)

Combine classic DOS-space shooters with Pokémon-like „collect 'em all“-gameplay and you get Pixelships. Sadly, there is no sound whatsoever. I recommend playing with some kind of media-player in the background.

**Blockball Evolution** [★★★★] [Link](http://www.blockball.de/)

Made by students of the german „Games Academy“ in Frankfurt. A Marble Madness-Clone with somewhat clunky controlls but highly enjoyable gameplay and a level editor!

**Synasthete** [★★★] [Link](http://www.fishbeat.com/games/synaesthete/)

Holy Hell, this game is trippy. A wierd combination between a Bemani-type rythm game and a third person shooter. No, I'm Serious. Unfortunately, it's also a bit too easy. Created by students at DigiPen.

**Genetos** [★★★★★] [Link](http://www.tatsuya-koyama.com/software/wg002_genetos_eng.html)

Do you like Shmups? Good, because this game is probably the best one you will get for free. Great presentation, a weapon system that adapts to your playstyle, tight gameplay and much much more.

**SoulFu** [★★★] [Link](http://www.aaronbishopgames.com/)

Short for „Secret of Ultimate Legendary Fantasy Unleashed“. A sprirtual successor to the classic Egoboo. Definitely not without it's flaws but if you like a nice 3D-Dungeon Crawler, give this game at least a try.

**RunMan: Race Around the world** [★★★★★] [Link](http://whatareyouwait.info/)

Probably my favourite platformer on the web. If you liked the 16-Bit Sonics in any way, this innocent-looking game by Tom Sennet and Matt Thorson will give you the ride of your life.

**Sonic Robo Blast 2** [★★★★] [Link](http://srb2.org/)

Speaking of Sonic. This is an awesome 3D-Platformer starring the blue Hedgehog. Complete with Multiplayer and Modding-Support. Yes, you heard that right. A 3D-Sonic. And it works.

**Wind&amp;Water: Puzzle Battles** [★★★★★] [Link](http://www.wind-water.net/)

One of the best Dreamcast puzzle games, ported to the PC and made freeware. If you like games like Bejewled or Tetris-Attack, look no further than this.

**Osu!** [★★★★★] [Link](http://osu.ppy.sh/)

An amazing Elite Beat Agents/Quendan-Clone with a vast library of songs, that is continously expanded by the community. Also, online leaderboards. Multiplayer, and a few other bells and whistles.

**Brogue** [★★★★] [Link](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/)

The ASCII-Roguelike of your dreams. Amazing depth, huge floors full of nasty surprises, Potions, Scrolls, Exploding Ooze, everything! One of my favourite coffee-break-games.

**Hydorah** [★★★★★] [Link](http://www.locomalito.com/hydorah.php)

A way too good-looking 2D-Shmup that feels like a mix between Star Fox and R-Type. Also, it is hard as shit. It can get frustrating but the overall production value is so high, that this is easy to overlook.

**Hero Core** [★★★★] [Link](http://www.remar.se/daniel/herocore.php)

A monochrome, zero-gravity metroidvania-game that will keep you glued to the screen for hours. The gameplay is as simple as it gets, but somethimes that is all you need.

**GeneRally** [★★★] [Link](http://gene-rally.com/)

A cute and chaotic miniature racing game that plays kind of like micro machines. While not incredibly fun when played alone, GeneRally becomes an absolute blast, when playing with friends.

**Echoes** [★★★★★] [Link](http://binaryzoo.com/games/echoes/)

Good news for everyone that likes Arena-Shooters: Echoes is a freeware mix between Asteroids and Geometry Wars and it is awesome. There's also an XBLIG-version called Echoes+

**Ta-Ta Mahatta** [★★★] [Link](http://www.renegadeware.com/TaTaMahatta/)

A 3D-Puzzle Platformer that hasn't exactly aged well, but is still very enjoyable. Well worth a look if you like the genre and can cope with somewhat slow gameplay.  Beware though. This game has *terrible* puns.

**Trilby: The Art of Theft** [★★★★] [Link](http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/games.htm)

What many people don't know: Ben „Yahtzee“ Croshaw, known for his Webshow „Zero Punctuation“ designs freeware adventure-games in his spare time. This is one of them. And it is quite enjoyable.

**War§ow** [★★★★★] [Link](http://www.warsow.net/)

By far, my favourite freeware shooting-game of all time. War§ow is a ridiculously fast competitive FPS that has a steep learning curve but provides a great sense of momentum, once you get behind the controls. 

**Happyland Adventures** [★★★] [Link](http://www.freelunchdesign.com/happylandadventures/)

A fun Platformer that reminds me of some of the older DOS-Jump'n'Runs. It's charming, it has great music and was made by the same people that created Icy Tower. 

**Hero Fighter** [★★★★] [Link](http://www.herofighter.com/)

The spiritual successor to Little Fighter 2 (You remamber that one, don't you? ;)) There are people who prefer LF2 to this. I actually like Hero Fighter a bit better. The combat feels really smooth.  

**Mobility** [★★★★★] [Link](ftp://ftp.hs-niederrhein.de/pub/win9x/games/mobility.exe)

Mobility is a city-simulator much like Sim City 2000 but with a focus on infrastructure and public transport. The difficulty curve is also a bit smoother. Freeware only until v1.73! Make sure to set language to english in the options menu.

**AceSpeeder** [★★★] [Link](http://www.raingraph.com/acespeeder)

I. Love. This. Game. And I have no Idea why. AceSpeeder is a racing game in the spirit of Wipeout or F-Zero. It's incredibly simple, but fun nonetheless. May or may not work on Windows 7!

**Ninjah** [★★★★] [Link](http://chrismingay.co.uk/ninjah/)

A colorful game about a little ninja that uses a hookshot and a gun to move around the map and will put your 2D-platforming-skills to the test. Level editor is included. Also avaivable on XBLIG.

**Super Mario Bros. X** [★★★★] [Link](http://smbx.mtsapd.com/)

No List would be Complete without a freeware Super Mario Bros.-tribute game. And from what I can tell, this is the best one. Don't believe me? Come and see for yourself. You will be amazed.

**suteF** [★★★] [Link](http://gamejolt.com/freeware/games/puzzle/sutef/4195/)

A creepy puzzle-platformer with amazing atmosphere, smart gameplay and a great finale. Not a long game but definitely one that will have your brain working to get to the end.

**Wing Commander Saga** [★★★★★] [Link](http://wcsaga.com/)

A full Wing Commander Fangame that has recently been released but never made much impact (As far as I can tell, anyways...). Oddly enough, because this is without a doubt one of the most impressive freeware games I have ever seen.

**Kernel Panic** [★★★★] [Link](http://springrts.com/wiki/Kernel_Panic)

A frantic real-time strategy game that plays somewhat similar to Darvinia/Mulltivinia but actually predates it. There is no resource-managing in this game, just pure tactics. Made using the Spring RTS-Engine. 

**Monolith** [★★★] [Pixelprospector-Link, because I couldn't find the real homepage :(](http://www.pixelprospector.com/monolith/)

For some reason, this game's presentation reminds me very much of Yoshi's Island. Anyway, Monolith is a nice Jump'n'Run with unique 2.5D-“cube“ graphics but also somewhat clunky controls.

I included a comeplte list of the ones I know about below. You know what I mean - games like Planescape: Torment or Mass Effect. I'm only counting adventure games where the different choices result in different gamestates, like in the Walking Dead.


**Sandbox**: the games mostly let you go where you want, though often limited in some way

5/5 *Fallout series*, a favorite of mine and a perfect example as you can talk past fights

3/5 *the Elder Scrolls series*, generally doesn't actually have that much dialogue that matters

1/5 *Two Worlds*, I guess there's a questline or two where it forks based on what you say

1/5 *Risen* some very basic choosing different questlines


**Highly Limited Sandbox**: you can go where you want but it's all gated off quite alot

5/5 *Planescape: Torment*, probably my favorite game ever

2/5 *Fable Series* I think Fable 1 was better for this, but basically you only get to choose from being a stereotypical nice guy or being a murderous cruel jerk for little reason


**Hub**: you get to move freely around a small area at a time

5/5 *Deus Ex series*

5/5 *Vampire: Bloodlines*] just started playing it, reminds me of Deus Ex quite a bit

5/5 *KotOR series*

4/5 *Mass Effect series*, fewer less detailed choices

?/5 *Jade Empire*... I didn't play much of this, I dont really recall. It was pretty prominent right?

**Mission Based**: you get to choose the order of missions somewhat, but you basically have to go through them all in a row

5/5 *Alpha Protocol*

4/5 *Dragon Age series*, very similar to Mass Effect there aren't a ton of choices


**Railroaded**: you have to go straight along the story, but you make choices as you do

5/5 *the Walking Dead*, pretty much the entirety of the game

1/5 *Binary Domain*, very limited, it's mostly a Third Person Shooter but there are different conversations and endings based on how you treat your squad

I suffered far too long from the ""no-games-to-play"" syndrome.

i've got nearly 200 games in my steam library and had always some difficulties choosing ""the one"" that i actually wanted to play.
in the process of choosing i often entered a state of depression, cause of the fact that i've got too much to choose from.


Recently i watched another episode of Dragonball (the first tournament). I thought about the system and how they tried to evaluate who fights who. Simply put, they made the first fights random by choosing balls with numbers. The fighters then progressed in form of the good old 1v1 system, the winner enters the next round and so on.


hopefully you get my idea by now :)

**My Solution:**

i made a list of my Steam library (i moved to the ""common"" folder via commandline, typed in ""dir"" and copied the whole list into a .txt file, naming it ""Steambattle.txt"")

**So i started with Round 1:**
i let the games fight against each other, starting with the game on top fighting the game below, thinking about the qualities of each game and compared them to my needs.  The winner will be cut out and moved in another .txt file called ""steambattle_round_2.txt"".

**Round 2:** 
the same procedure as Round 1.

* 1v1 (top vs bottom)

* compare qualities to needs

* move to round 3

**That way i came down to 6 games:** 

* BioShock Infinite

* Dead Space

* Fallout 3 goty

* Gothic II

* Morrowind

* The Witcher Enhanced Edition


I am perfectly fine with the selection given me by that list and want to play each game it contains. Now comes the hard part, deciding what i want to play now. but thats a fight i have to fight for myself, just wanted to give you guys a brief idea of the ""solution"" that works for me. 

The whole procedure (including writing this post) took me a good hour. Creating the list and fighting the tournament took me 20 minutes + 10 minutes for what we call in austria ""brainfapping"" (actually thinking about this post, formatting, and an idea of automating this process)

The post took me roughly half an hour. It's obvious that english ain't my first language, so i've got a couple of difficulties and hope you understand my post ;)

help is appreciated.


**tldr:**  Let the games fight Dragonball- tournament style. Let the game win that you want to play most, always comparing 2 games against each other and to your needs (1v1, game at the top of the list vs the game below it, excluding DLC's/Addons)",,False,,t5_2sxyv,False,,,True,t3_1jg5mq,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1jg5mq/steambattle_my_solution_to_nogamestoplay_syndrome/,

This can apply to ANY genre. Absolutely any game that shows you growing in power visually, be it a city builder, an RPG or adventure, an RTS war simulator, or so on. So long as I can SEE this growth.

For example, Crusader Kings is all played on a boardgame. I can't SEE my cities or my armies or castles or anything like that.

In Civ V, for example, you can actually notice your cities grow visually and buildings be built on each plot of land you take over.

Regarding RPGs or adventure games, use Overlord for example. Your little dark tower thing turns from a rotting ruin into a Mordor-esque upgradeable fortress that looks cooler as the game progresses.

I did the first little bomb quest, completed Arefu, explored vault 106, finished two of three Moira book quests, and did a bit of random recon.  I got to level 7 or so and then... my worst nightmare.  Everyone's worst gaming nightmare.

My SO had just finished his turn playing and passed the controller to me.  He had just saved his game and I went to load my own save and, in my stuffed-up head-cold daze, I SAVED OVER MY OWN SAVE WITH HIS SAVE!  I hadn't backed out of the save menu into the load menu!  I realized right away what had happened and I felt even sicker than I already was.  There's nothing I can do.  My save is GONE!

Sigh.

I accepted my fate and started over from the vault save.  This time, though, I blazed through the quests with confidence and I'm close to caught up.  I'm going to make a new save every once in a while now.  I almost have as much money as I did before.  I would love to know your thoughts on house upgrades and if any of them are worth the money.

So, have any of you suffered a save-loss before?

Nothing pleases me more than million-damage hits in Disgaea or removing the time limit in Viccy and watching my population swell to billions. In short I'm the kind of guy who likes unlimited games where numbers get increasingly crazier.

Some examples:

* Level 90 factories in Victoria
* Solar system-sized ships in Star Ruler
* Gemcraft Labyrinth (multi-million damage towers)
* OpenTTD (huge map with 50,000+ population cities, though sadly airport size caps)
* Space Empires 5 (infinite research)

EDIT: Games I've already played (in addition to the above):

* Civilization series
* X series
* Anno series
* Factorio (in infinite game world)
* Elder Scrolls series (always looked for no skill cap mods)
* Dungeon Defenders (CRAZY numbers)
* Prison Architect (infinite land purchases = infinite prison)
* Minecraft
* Terraria
* Disgaea
* Star Ruler
* Victoria

Not to sound like a hipster, but as it's old and obscure it's unlikely that you've heard of it, so let me explain.
Basically, it is a space sandbox similar to Elite or Freelancer, but 2D and turn-based, made by a team of no-name Russian developers who years later went on to develop recent King's Bounty titles, amongst other things.  
You are a ranger - a space mercenary, your sole mission is to defeat alien invaders threatening your arm of the galaxy, you don't get any funding or anything, but no obligations either - in fact, you can do whatever and watch other rangers win the game for you.  
It all boils down to ""get more money, buy better gear, take on stronger enemies and get more money"". There are various ways to earn money and experience and kill time: you can, well, kill invaders and sell loot for profit; you can be a pirate and either rob civilian ships or just blow them up and pick up what's left; you can trade goods (buy low, sell high, nothing special) blowing up pirates as you go; or you can help governments on their missions, ranging from simple FedEx quests to text-based adventures. There are in fact hundreds of those, from simple puzzles to various simulators, strategy games and RPGs, all written on the game's own engine.  
Oh, and you can fight real-time top-down shooter minigames if you want to get artifacts to enhance your ship in unique ways.  
The sequel adds more stuff, such as competing factions of alien invaders, planetary exploration, buffs, debuffs and enchantments (stims, hacks and modules in technobabble), real time strategy battles with with custom robots, and so on, is generally superior in every way and vastly recommended over the original (the game doesn't exactly have a lengthy plotline so there's nothing to miss)  
Despite its seeming simplicity, however, it is very complex mechanically. For example, the price of goods depends on supply and demand, economical system and the type of government the planet has. Or, aside from you there are hundreds of ships, maybe thousands, and every single ship does the things they do depending on their internal logic - traders watch the market, read news, buy low and sell high, etc, etc. I won't of course mention all the various tips and tricks as there are literally hundreds of them, such as dropping some of your loot as an impromptu countermeasure against incoming rocket swarms, or blowing up fuel cans to wipe several enemies at once, etc.  
Also, for an old 2-D game it looks absolutely stunning. Sprites don't get old, and screenshots of space and planetary surfaces are so breath-taking they deserve being wallpapers.  
That's it, I guess.

Shooters with Rpg elements like Farcry 1, 2 ,3, and the Bioshock games. And of course I've been into Zelda games since I was a kid. Problem is, I've delved back a decade or two even, so I've played Baldur's date 1 and 2, Planescape Torment, System Shock, Deus Ex, and the other older games usually recommended on r/gamingsuggestions.

I'll just jump right into it. I don't want to completely throw out older RPGs, but I'd prefer more modern ones. I won't care at all if I only get older games suggested, but I'm just saying in case it matters.

Graphics aren't huge but a nice aesthetic is important. I couldn't get into Gothic because it's aesthetic was just.. off to me. Yet I loved the way Baldur's Gate looks. It just looks pleasing, and I can get myself immersed into the game.

As for how I'm playing, I do not want a party game. I'm so tired of party games and micro managing, I just want to be the hero, no one else. I'm looking for an Elder Scrolls feel where my hero is the focus of my game, I guess.

That's the biggest thing I look for in an RPG. Whether or not it's turn-based or click to swing doesn't matter, so long as it's intuitive and I don't have to draw magic or something, haha.

As for what I'd be playing it on, I have an xbox 360 and a PC that can just barely make Skyrim's cut. Witcher 2 was not going to happen on this poor laptop.

Story would be nice to have, but I'm not going to totally avoid a game with a typical story. I felt Oblivion was a very typical game in terms of it's story that had rather cliched fantasy elements, but it was told nicely and it was fun to play through. So, that's just my take on it. I mean, the better the story, the happier I am. But I'm not the kind of gamer who stopped playing Fallout 3 because it wasn't anywhere near up to par of Fallout 1/2.

Now I'll just list off RPGs that I really enjoy;

Witcher 1/2, The Elder Scrolls 3-5, Dark Souls, Star Wars: KotOR, Fable TLC, Mass Effect 1-3, Baldur's Gate 1/2, Dablo 1-3, WoW, Guild Wars 1, and I'm stretching to think of any other's. There's others but I don't think they really would influence someone's decision of a game to recommend.

* Turn based combat

* A new game typically lasts 45-60 mins. After that it ends. The dungeons/characters are randomly generated each time.

* You have some characters and it's a turn based fight - top view. The characters don't animate I guess. It's just their pics.

* The graphics were kind of cartoonish. It's not a very old game. Came out within the last 6-8 years max.

* The dungeon has a top view and is divided into sections. At any time you can see only your room and a very little bit into the neighboring room.


* You have 4 characters throughout the game. You control them at the same time.

**Edit: Added some more info since people said it sounds generic.**

* At a time you cannot see the whole map. You can only see 2-3 rooms max. The rooms appear big. The characters are about the size of Dota Heroes on screen kind of. 

* Most of the suggestions currently are showing the dos game type having pixels, and where you can see the full map. But this game is a fairly new one. I'm sure it came out in the 2000s only and not before. And it runs on windows.

* When the fighting happens then you go into a different screen with all your characters on one side and enemy characters on the other side. Actually your characters = card showing you character photo.

**Edit2: Solved!**

So, here's the thing. Since I can remember, I really enjoy games where you can watch/manipulate npcs fights. I always enjoyed summon classes, monster collecting games, but I' looking for something with more action or, how can I say, more alive.

For example, In Skyrim I loved to just sit and watch Imperials fight Stormcloaks, then I spawned dragons, werewolves, giants and just sat there watching everything. I got tired really quick, but enjoyed.

And then I played Borderlands 2. If you haven't played yet (I really recommend it) there's an enemy called Goliath. If you shoot a Goliath in the head it goes on a rampage fighting every living thing around. And the best thing is that when it kills his companions he can level up and grow bigger and stronger, adquiring new names like Bad-ass Goliath, Huge Mass of Destruction and Godliath. I enjoyed this **so much** in Borderlands 2 that now I'm craving for a game with something similar. I fucking **love** games where enemies can level up/transform and can act almost as a player.

The perfect thing for me would probably be a first person adventure game where I can be/am on godmode and I can watch/manipulate fights between loads and loads of different npcs.

So, suggestions? And also, does this kind of ""genre"" have a name?

The Testament of Sherlock Holmes,

OTOH, getting a Thursday or Friday.... ahem... team-building event rolling with the guys that work for me (I run a software development dept.) might not be a bad idea.  Kicking the boss's ass in a game might start the weekend off right, and I might build the skills to keep up with my son.

-Thanks-

I am not talking only Space Sims, though I think those are the most numerous.**

Personally, I have been playing Faster Than Light and want something similar but deeper. I also supported the kick starter for [Start Citizen](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen/) but it wont be out till 2014. Also, Mount and Blade I think sort of fits this style of game, even though there is no ship, and it is one of my all time favorites. But traditionally I've not played many space sims, so I am hesitant to jump into them, especially since some (X3) I hear have a steep learning curve.

I would like to see if we can make a list of all these games along with key features and how to decide which one is right for people.

**To Define it** - this genre is a mix between RPG set in a large world with Small unit tactical fights when you encounter enemies. Combat and trade and (sometimes) politics are allowed. Economy is important.

You Start off with one person/ship and you expand, possibly into an fleet of ships, or a trade empire. You often hire companions or wing men, and they too might progress in an RPG fashion.

There is strategy and resources but these are **NOT** 4x games. And not JUST space flight sims. 

Though EVE online is certainly one of these, I want to focus on single player games. 

**EXAMPLE GAMES:**

* X Series
* Freelancer
* Sid Meiers Pirates!
* Mount and Blade

There are a ton more... If you have played one, put it up and describe it. Even old games, if they are still the best option for some reason and still playable.

**Questions to answer:**

* Ease or Complexity to Learn?
* Realistic Death (Perm Death vs Just losing Ship, etc)?
* How ""deep"" is the economy - What can/can't you buy?
* How open is the game or is it Story Driven?
* Realism vs Cartoony
* More Simulation or RPG oriented?
* Can you hire crew/companions? How detailed is this?
* Can you make your own ship, or customize? How detailed is this?
* How does it relate to other games in this genre you have played?
* Also, would you recommend others play and any other key details...

What I'm looking for are games where the player exists in an ever changing, dynamic battle between various computer controlled factions. However, unlike some games (CIV, EU, and similar), you aren't really bound to any particular side or a target. You just exist as an independent agent who is looking to build up their empire/wealth/country/whatever. 

Further in the game, you can start to take sides, subjecting yourself to the battles of the computer, or you can decide to carve out your own space and act as a raider/pirate/legitimate nation/whatever. The eventual goal is to navigate and survive this changing political landscape.

I think a major attraction to this type of game is that you're working for something. You don't start off with a mighty kingdom or vast wealth, and you're certainly not going to be able to take on any of your potential adversaries. You have to build it up yourself, and there is a worry that your work will go to waste.

Even if it is part of a tried and true series (The Elder Scrolls) or a slowly dying hack-n-slash (Koei's Warriors series) I always find more of a return on time invested watching what happens with my created object and seeing what they go through. I've played the majority of Sims titles, and Civ/AoE/Spore have my strategy fix.

TL;DR Create your own player games.

(sort of like the weekly /r/Games thread)",swancheez,23,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1glojx/new_gaming_subreddit_rwhatareyouplaying_designed/,"Hi everyone!

I don't know about you, but one of my favorite parts of /r/Games is the weekly ""What games are you playing"" discussion thread. It always sparks interesting conversation, and gives me the opportunity to see how others feel about the games they are currently playing. Granted, you can find that kind of information in reviews and the like, but what makes the /r/Games thread so special is that anyone can contribute and any game can be discussed! It is so refreshing to see peopel discussing games that were released decades ago right alongside games that were released only a few days ago. These types of discussions help to bring up major points about a game without ruining the experience for those of us who have not yet managed to play some of these games, or who may be on the fence on whether or not to purchase a game.

This is where /r/WhatAreYouPlaying comes in! It is an entire subreddit dedicated to discussing the games that you are currently playing, without the restriction of it being once a week in a thread that gets buried far too quickly (especially around this time when new consoles are all the talk). With the new subreddit, I hope to accomplish everything that the /r/Games weekly discussion thread accomplishes, plus a few more objectives. While the /r/Games discussion may be enough for some, I know I am craving just a little bit more, so with /r/WhatAreYouPlaying, we hope to:

* Foster any and all discussion about games of the past and present
* Unlike the current threads, we will have spoiler and spoiler-free threads for game discussions.
* Entire threads can be dedicated to single games, instead of one thread dedicated to entire game catalogs. 
* Bring players of old and new games together for invigorating discussions.
* Limit all posts to self-posts so as to not have the front page cluttered with nonsense

Lastly, and this feature is one that I am striving for and can only hope to achieve with active participation, is a sort of ""look and find"" for players of particular games, especially those with low player counts. I know it can be hard sometimes to find gamers to play certain games with online due to lack of server support, general lack of players, or just a need to play with individuals who meet our gamer criteria. With this new community, I hope to merge the field of ""What are you playing"" with the need to find gamers for a particular game, so that there is a one-stop community where everyone can go to find gamers that they want to play with, and to discuss the current games they are playing.

This is of course only the start of this community, so help keep it active and join today! (Also looking for extra moderators if the subscriber count jumps!) :)",,False,,t5_2sxyv,False,,,True,t3_1glojx,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1glojx/new_gaming_subreddit_rwhatareyouplaying_designed/,

*(Super awesome second edit: I also have a DS, the regular kind, but I don't play it as often)*

A lot of the games I've played have been fun, but not many of them have made me feel like I've accomplished or achieved anything. Except the ""achievements"" on consoles and Steam, but most of those are just spoonfed to you. What are some games that made you feel like you did something of consequence? What games gave you the feeling that your time spent with it was worthwhile?

Some of the few games I've played that have done this for me are:

* Morrowind and Oblivion. (tried Skyrim, it hurt to play, I'm sorry)
* Fable II and III (liked them both, but for different reasons I can't quite place at the moment)
* Faster Than Light (still haven't beaten it, but *damn* is it fun trying)
* Portal I and II (sure, the boss battles weren't great, but it was more about solving the science)
* *Edit for funsies: Saints Row 2, as wacky and nutty as it was, I still felt like I accomplished something while playing it. Except that damn epilogue. How hard is it to stop a damn bus without blowing it up?*

I've played several Star Wars games (Knights of the Old Republic II, Jedi Academy, and Jedi Outcast) and those were close, but KOTOR felt like it dragged on too long and there were many elements I just ignored because I never seemed to need them, and the Jedi games were okay. I've tried Dragon Age Origins, but it felt very bland. And Lord of the Rings War in the North felt more like ""Brown/Gray RPG"".

*Still first edit for first funsies: GTA IV, while pretty good overall, was just weighed down by the ""companion"" system/missions, for lack of a better word, where you have to hang out with Roman and everyone else in order to get bonuses. I liked the idea, but it became too involved over time.*

I have Legend of Grimrock sitting in my Steam account and I'm probably going to start that next; I've heard good things. I also have Witcher 1 &amp; 2 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution waiting at home. I'm holding off on Mass Effect for when I have a bit more time on my hands, as from what I've heard I'll be sinking a lot of time into it.

Just wanted to post an update. Thanks for all your suggestions. The simplest solution was also, in retrospect, the most obvious one.

When she arrived at my place, she discovered the little white box under my TV and said: ""Do you have a Wii?"" I replied that yes, this was a Wii. Basically she had seen a report on how Nintendo gave a couple of consoles to retirement homes in Germany and how beneficial it was for the seniors to have something to do that also involved moving around.

We played Mariokart, Wii Sports (tennis, golf, bowling) and Wii Play (mostly ping pong and laser hockey). She won at laser hockey and lost all the other games, but she really loved playing all of them, especially bowling - she used to go bowling with my dad once a month, but can't do it anymore thanks to age and arthritis. She had trouble releasing the button in the right moment and didn't really get the analogy Nintendo tried to pull with how the Wiimote has to be held to control the ball - but she loved every minute of it.

As I said, in retrospect, it was quite obvious. I showed her several PC games I enjoyed, from casual games like Peggle or Puzzleworld, to sophisticated games like Assassin's Creed or L.A. Noire. While she marveled at the graphics and the level of story telling, she didn't understand much of it (as I said, she only speaks German) and as she doesn't like violence, it didn't have much appeal.

I'm looking for good TBS games to play on my PC. I've played a bunch of them and I would like some suggestions.

I mainly enjoy turn based fights which require a good strategy. If the game has some RPG elements it would be better. If possible, it should be recent or have nice graphics (Jagged Alliance 2 and Fallout are OK, Xcom: UFO defense and HOMM 3 are not).

So far I have played:

* Xcom: EU (really enjoyed it)
* Shadowrun Returns (great story, combat too easy and lack of balance)
* Omerta (meh, repetitive, combat too easy)
* Expeditions: Conquistador (awesome game, need a lot of strategy to survive, great RPG elements)
* King's Bounty Legend (playing it right now, the RPG part is fine, the TBS combat feels a bit ""flat"", terrains are really really small, you can't deploy a good strategy and you have very few units)
* Fallout (needed some time to get use to the graphics, but great game)
* Jagged Alliance 2 (same as Fallout)

I've tried some games like the Total War series or Civilization, but it's not really what I'm looking for. 

Bonus Questions: I also have the others king's bounty, thanks to the 1C bundle from last week. How are they compared to the ""Legend"" ?

But where do I go from here?

Minecraft - is tits of course. Slap on tekkit for some serious industrial scale shenanigans, the possibilities are endless.

Dwarf Fortress - Perfect except for the fact that deep down you know your computer will crap out if you try and do something cool, and even playing it safe it's only a matter of time until the lag starts. This is the end-all-be-all of base building games.

Kerbal Space Program - omfg so good. If only the attachments for space stations were more stable. Add in some sort of resource management/gathering and I would lose another month of my life to it.

Cataclysm (the zombie roguelike) - Awesome game, the only real zombie apocalypse game that I know of besides DayZ. The rest are all fps/puzzle/arcade/story based bullshit. I played an awesome flash based one a while ago called dead frontier but the developer killed it by changing the zombies into ""monsters"".

DayZ - The best survive/scavenge game I've ever played, hackers killed it dead though.

And that's it, no point looking at Minecraft clones or dumbed down base building games those two are basically the pinnacle of their respective arenas. After DayZ and cataclysm any other already existing sandbox survival game (if one even exists) would only be a let down. I would absolutely love a space game where I could build my own ships and scour the universe for resources to build a bigger ship etc. It sounds like notch is working on something like that but aside from shores of whatever it is (which is too buggy to play) they don't exist yet.

I'm looking for what you might call a unique racing game.  I typically only play racers or online flash games, because FPS games give me motion sickness headaches and that sucks.

Anywho, I'm looking for a racing game where you start at the bottom and work your way up.  You either drive for your own 'team' with junk equipment and finishing near the bottom of the field, or you drive for another team with junk.  As you get money, you upgrade your car and your team, until you're running up front and winning races.  The closest game I can think of this is NASCAR '06: Total Team Control.  I'd also like it if you could own a team, or your own team and manage finances, R&amp;D, etc., preferably for PC.  I only own a PC and a 360.

I've played GRiD which was fun, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for as far as the team aspect, and upgrading vehicles.  I also own F1 2010, which is another good one, and very similar to what I'm looking for.  It doesn't necessarily have to be NASCAR-style games, but just as long as it's fun and it has the majority of the features listed above.

-Really good storyline that makes you want to find out what happens next (Heavy Rain, pretty much any Final Fantasy)

-Macabre and over-the-top, but relatively easy action (Alice games, Shadows of the Damned)

For some reason, I liked FF XIII a lot while recognizing its numerous flaws, and I can't get into XIII-2 at all for some reason.  It seems like most people feel the opposite about these two games.  I'm about 20 hours into the game and have absolutely no idea what I'm even supposed to be doing any more.  (Like many other people, FFVI is my all-time fave in the series, and I'm going to DL FFVII from the store)  Also, if a game is too hard I'll generally just put it down or rage-quit.  I like RPGs that aren't too insanely open and complex - I couldn't get into the Elder Scrolls or Fallout games.  They make me feel like a senile old man in a Walmart.  I guess the reason I liked FF XIII is that it did enough hand-holding that I didn't get totally lost.  I tend not to like anime-style graphics, as well. 

I've added Dead Island (over the top, macabre, mindless violence), Shadow of the Colossus (just seems to be universally favored so I'll give it a whirl), and Dungeon Siege III (I haven't played it and understand that it might fall into the category of being more open-ended and complicated than I normally go for, but I'll try it anyhow).

I love the assassins creed games as they fit this criteria perfectly. Not to big of a fan of RPGs but rather like playing action/adventure games.

Just some games that I have played recently that I really enjoyed to give you guys a taste of what I enjoy:

* Max Payne 3
* Assassins Creed Series
* Mass Effect Series ( RPG but simplied RPG which I dont mind )
* Arkham Asylum and Arkham City
* SWTOR ( could not afford monthly fees )
* Half Life Games
* Portal 1 / Portal 2

I am really running out of games to play that fit my picky requirements. I was thinking of playing Spec Ops The Line as I heard the story was awesome but I really want to play something fantasy or medieval times ( I want to stab someone with a sword :D ). 

Any help from you guys would be greatly appreciated

Things I enjoyed about Jump to Lightspeed:

- Nicely done character advancement. It was excited to get new ships, buy a new missile launcher, reach a new rank in the military, etc.
- It was Star Wars. Other settings are fine, as long as it's an engaging IP.
- You could explore fairly risk free: other players weren't shooting at you, and the penalty for dying was not severe.
- The game had social aspects - you could fly with other players, and there were nice economic tie-ins between the space and ground games.
- A game with good graphics would be nice (I'm running an ATI 7870) but that's low importance.

I've been curious about getting into an MMO again, but it seems like such an over-saturated market.

A couple things:

**I accept the holy trinity.**

I like the idea of a healer being a healer, a tank being a tank, and a DPS type character dealing damage. Fulfilling a role is one of the reasons I PLAY MMOs.

**I like being encouraged/force to work together with others.**

I've been playing a LOT of DotA 2 lately, and the cooperation it requires of all 5 members makes it extremely addicting. Some of my most memorable experiences in WoW involve dungeons and bosses where a group has to work together in an intricate weave of cooperation.

**I am done paying monthly fees.**

Since the day I added up the amount of money I had spent on WoW (Base game and expansions) and monthly fees, I have no interest in paying a monthly fee. I am alright with an initial purchase, and even a game that has payment options for additional content, quicker leveling, etc. I just can't justify a monthly fee these days, as spare time gets less.

**Conclusion.**

Since moving to China I've found that playing my regular group of games (Borderlands, Company of Heroes, Team Fortress etc.) with friends back in the UK is just about impossible due to latency.

I do, however, really like the idea of having a 'long-term' multiplayer game that I can play with friends, something that doesn't require low latency and something that we can just dip into now and again. Sim City would have been pretty much perfect if it weren't for all the derpiness going on there.

Canvas Rider    
Blood Brothers (Android)   
Pokemon/Pokemonium   
Bejeweled (certain modes)

All these games don't have any time limit or pressing need to continue, and simple controls. That means I can easily flip from what I am doing to the game for a moment or two and then drop the game where it is and go back to what I was doing originally. 

I'm not a casual gamer, but I do enjoy casual games. So tactical turn-based games or casual whatever is ok. It just has to run windowed, and be relatively resource light and able to be muted.

I'm looking for a game to get hooked on until D3 and GW2 come out.  Genre-wise, I tend to avoid first person game or ""hyper-masculine main character"" games.  Almost anything else is open!

I loved WoW, enjoyed SWToR somewhat.  I rocked skyrim, but loathed Kingdoms of Amalur and Two Worlds 2 because they felt so... unoriginal.  I found Fallout 3 too sparsely populated to enjoy, so I didn't get far (does it get better?)

Civ 5 kept me occupied for a month, and SimCity 2k will always have a special place in my heart.  I know Anno 2070 is on sale, but I haven't seen any compelling videos that make it stand out over something like SimCity.

I had a hankering for Myst, and it's had some of my most enjoyable gaming moments.

Basically... I love games that have a rich world and encourage skill development. Whether that skill is puzzle solving or city organization I'm pretty open. Something I can really sink my brain in to.

I've been considering Anno 2070, Fable: The Lost Chapters (never played a Fable game), re-playing the Myst games, or even re-subbing to WoW.  Graphics matter to me, so going to far into the late 90's gaming library can be a challenge.

1375915121.0,11,self.gamingsuggestions,1jwzmd,I'm looking for games with great exploration.,Johnicus,11,0,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1jwzmd/im_looking_for_games_with_great_exploration/,"I have a PC (can run pretty much anything since I recently upgraded), a PS2, a PS3 and a DS. 

I'd like to play more games that have fun exploration mechanics. I love exploring new places in games and finding cool things in out-of-the-way locations and so on, and just exploring games with great landscapes or maps. Getting rewarded for exploration or having it be a major focus would be a plus.

I like it when games reward you for poking around and exploring. For example: games like The Last of Us where, if you take your time, you can get a lot of secret or extra supplies, or the Serious Sam games, where clever thinking and exploration can bring you to whole new areas and get you secret items, are good, if small, examples of this. However, I often explore too much and it becomes very tedious getting back to the main action if there's a large area to look around and nothing really in it. Games like Dark Souls that can give you a huge reward for exploring (finding two entire levels because you broke through a few fake walls) are fantastic, but making the exploration nearly impossible if you don't have a guide/an experienced player isn't so great (EG figuring out that there are two false walls in that area). I'd prefer the game to require some clever thinking and problem solving if it has these kinds of secrets.

Things I'm not really too excited about are exploration systems like WoW or some parts of Oblivion where you can find a really neat area or location, but the game just throws a little bit of experience at you and essentially tells you ""good job, now either come back when you have the right quest to actually get something out of this place"" or ""enjoy your pointless easter egg area"". These games also have very few of the rewarding-to-find secrets or really interesting locations I'm looking for compared to the size of their worlds. Both games have a lot of neat areas...that are all kinda samey and that the game leads you to with a breadcrumb trail. The places that are off the beaten path usually don't have anything really good in them and aren't interesting. The reason I'm harping on about this is that an open-world game with the kind of stuff I'm looking for would be *awesome*, but a lot of the time there are just a few little secrets in a *HUGE* world, and it isn't really worth it to look for them.

As far as the games go, I put gameplay before everything else (if it isn't fun to play, why play it?). Otherwise, I love a great story and soundtrack. Graphics aren't really a big point, but I do like games that look nice. Basically, I love the hell out of the first Deus Ex (looks like ass), but I also love games like Dark Souls and Tales of Graces (looks pretty damn great).

I apologize if I'm going on and on and on, but I figure that you guys having as much context and clarification as possible for your suggestions is better than just saying ""hey I like exploring shit and having it work my skinner box k gimme suggestions"" and then looking like an ass because I respond to a bunch of you with ""no it has X that I don't like"" or ""not enough Y"" or you get the point.

* Itemization somewhere between that game and Baldur's Gate 2 (in terms of variety, ""cool"", unique, upgrade-able magic weapons, etc.)

* Item customization magically merging systems from Diablo 2 or better clones, with Final Fantasy 7's Materia system.

* A large sandbox/open world like Elder Scrolls games to explore.

The other restriction is on the battle system: I want some sort of interaction in the combat system other than pressing Attack and waiting. Some notable games that I like that have this sort of system are:

The Legend of Dragoon - Turn based; press attack and you have to perform an Addition, essentially a combo with timed button presses.

Star Ocean series - Free to run around in a small battle area, able to use skills and normal attacks at any time.

.hack series - Not one of my favorites, however has all the basic elements I like. Open world inhabited by monsters, no ""battle mode""; fight monsters in an open field, able to use skills and attack at any time.

Baten Kaitos - Turn based, all attack and defense based on a card system similar to Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, tactics involved in keeping cards you need available.

Kingdom Hearts - Great amount of mobility on the battle field, definitely a lot of action elements, which I enjoy.

In short, lots of meaningful data but good interface.

Unfortunately the underlying game in EvE was boring to me. I'd have much more fun with just playing the spreadsheets (just kidding... but close).

I expect MMO's have the most ""real"" economies (due to real players). But what I am looking for does not have to be an online game, even single player is fine if the economy is simulated well enough.

Noire and I really enjoyed the first few cases. It was fun to investigate the crime scene, interrogate witnesses, look for clues or inconsistencies in the suspects' stories, etc. After a while, though, it became too easy since, if a clue was irrelevant, the main character would say so and, if it was relevant, a note would be added to your journal. Also, every case relied too heavily on lie detection and you could solve just about every case by reading people's faces correctly.

I recently made a post over at /r/Games where I was asking about quality games for someone age 12-14, and I was told about the existence of this subreddit. 

I recently built my little brother a budget-based gaming computer, and he's been loving it so far. He spends almost all of his time playing Minecraft, which is a great game to play with friends (he has his own server that they all use). 

Anyway, I just figured that he might expand his gaming library a bit now that he has a considerably more powerful rig.

A few (rough) guidelines. He tends to enjoy games that can be played with friends. I've tried to get him into single-player games, but he hasn't really bit that bullet yet. Games with multiplayer functionality are greatly preferred.

A few suggestions that came up on /r/Games were:

Torchlight II: I showed this to him and he looked interested. This might be the current front-runner because he can still play this with his friends.

AoE II: I had never played this game when I was younger, and I feel like I missed out on part of my childhood. I showed it to him after he requested a 'war' game, and he seemed to really like the idea of it. Multiplayer makes the game much more appealing as well.

FTL: I don't know about this one. I *loved* the game, but I feel that it could potentially be frustrating for someone a bit younger, and there is a noticeable learning curve. It's also hard to show someone the game, as it tends to be one of those games where you only really enjoy it when you play it yourself. 

A few others that came up were Tribes: Ascend (which he plays), Left 4 Dead 2 (rated M as far as I know... that won't fly), Just Cause 2 (he's watched my older brother play this... again, won't fly with the parents), and a few others.

I'm a huge Tradewinds fan (yes, the pirate game). I love the opening up new areas and trading commodities for profit and bombing the crap out of some pirates and upgrading my ship. The UI is simple, so I don't have to spend a fortnight learning a new game (which, frankly, unless it's the best damned game ever made, I don't have time for - I work and commute a ton). I also love space.

I'm late to the PC gaming scene (started late in 2003 or so), so I hadn't even heard of Freelancer until about 2 months ago. I've been playing it quite a bit, as well as another game I ran across called Black Market HD, which I actually like quite a bit more. If you aren't familiar with it, you can take a look at it over at http://www.bigblockgames.com/games/blackmarket/ ...it's basically Tradewinds in space. There's that demo there and then there's a full game they don't really tell you about right up front, so be warned. The demo probably lasts for 2-3 hours before you start running in to issues.

Are there any other games like this out there? I am having some real difficulty in finding any.

Thanks a bunch!

Edit: Ooooh, and Galaxy on Fire. I have that one too. It's excellent.

Follow up edit: Thanks for all the great suggestions, guys! A lot of these games (like Evochron Mercenary or X3) do not lend themselves well to an extremely limited amount of playtime, but they are definitely excellent suggestions (and I own most of them). If anyone has suggestions which are more like Tradewinds or Black Market, I am all ears. If you are not familiar with these games, they are characterized by an easy to understand UI, storyline quests and open world trading. Unfortunately, I am out of the house for work upwards of 65 hours per week and I am not interested in spending 10 hours to learn a game (basically, if you would use the words ""tactics"", ""depth"" or ""learning curve"" in your description, it's probably not a good fit).

Just looking for thoughtful responses.",JHouck8390,14,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/19djao/ah_a_self_post_just_looking_for_thoughtful/,"If I were to create a game, I would like it to be deadly. I would NOT like it to be the kind of game where players run around killing each other for the hell of it. To make the game deadly, players will need to put forth effort to survive. In a well supported area, that may be a small amount of effort, but in the wilder areas of the world, it may take quite a bit more. The most difficult thing for a game to do is curb the influx of players who like to cause other players grief. It would seem to me that the best method of doing this is to allow for extensive PvE content and to put in place many barriers that cause griefing to be far too difficult to warrant the effort except to the incredibly dedicated.

Now, the game would require an extensive crafting system built off of a complex resource gathering and management system. The problem that many games encounter is players build a crafter or gatherer and also create another character to have fun on. I put forth the challenge that gathering and crafting should be fun to begin with. Nothing harms an ingame economy more than the presence of mule characters whose sole purpose is to perpetuate the open world arena deathmatch style of gameplay which pervades the attempts to create a sandbox MMO.

The following ideas are not put in any specific order, but are all important to the conceptualization of this game. Resources should be gathered in asymmetrical chunks, not easily divisible units. All, or nearly all, resources should have meaningful uses, and a balanced tradeoff should exist between all competing resources. There should be no spawn points in the traditional sense, because they become exploitable and players place them on farm. Instead, there should be a breeding mechanic for wild and domesticated animals. Owning a farm would become a viable playstyle. Breeding should also allow for super-breeds which increase some aspect of the species. Skills should decay on inactivity. There should be an exponential curve in regards to building a skill and effort placed into it. The decay of a skill should begin slow and accelerate if left to fester. Writing or reading a book should allow players to retain their skill without decay and also avoid using materials in a method similar to grinding. Books should have diminishing returns, though. So if you only own one book, you begin to decay even though you read it. Books should only support skills used by the writer. Magic should exist. Magic should be extremely risky and highly rewarding. It should also fail, a lot. Failure can be mundane, uninspiring and discouraging, but it also has a chance to be debilitating, destructive and deadly. So risk must be mitigated, and skill gained in magic should be slow going. But skill, once gained, allows for control over potent power. Permadeath is a requirement to allow each mechanic I envision to work. It allows balance between risk and reward. You won't risk losing your magician that can cast unimaginable magic in order to pursue omnipotence. You won't kill another player in the middle of town and risk dying yourself since you have spent so long finding that amazing armor. Caravans, wagons, and other methods of mass transportation of goods must exist to allow players to move items. Bandits should have legitimate opportunity to be bandits. Being a bandit does not mean killing people and laughing that you destroyed the fruits of their labor. Being a bandit means you kill a convoy of caravans in the wilderness and loot their wares to sell as your own. Killing all witnesses and never revealing your criminal behavior to anyone is what it means to be a successful bandit. Outlaws should exist, too. They should be utilized by bandits, or desperate players, to do unsavory things they would dare not do. An underworld should be fostered, but it should not be allowed to flow into the light.

I will edit this later for readability, maybe. But, for now, I want to just put ideas out there to be commented on and feed the discussion of the community. It just occurred to me, that the most important aspect that is missing from many attempts at creating an MMOS is the RPG. You don't need programmed content to roleplay. In fact, storyline quests actually railroad roleplaying. You do need a dynamic framework and other players willing to meld into your narrative. So, I guess, what I really want to create is a MMOSRPG. (MMOSandboxRPG for you slow ones.)

EDIT::
Additional suggestions:
Apprenticing other players via some sort of cooperative crafting option. Also, could have them study books you've written as a more advanced practitioner of whatever art you are teaching them.
An example of complexity in resources would be building a fire for refining iron to steel. Certain amounts of certain wood would create the necessary temperature. Or, lesser wood and some accelerants would accomplish the goal. You would need to experiment to find the right combination. At the same time, burning too hot would cause an action to fail miserable... such as cooking a steak.
A dynasty system could lessen the impact of permadeath, but I would require it to necessitate raising a child you've adopted or had born to your dynasty. It would allow you to govern the education and socialization of a following character that sort of pre-trains it for how you want to play. Or, you could pay someone else to train your child for you, if you're wealthy and not into raising children.
I didn't originally like the idea of NPCs, but I think it could be balanced if you have to pay a wage to your NPC workers who have specific tasks. For example, if you have a huge stockpile of goods, you hire an NPC to sell something for a target price, or you locate a mineral vein and hire NPCs to hack away at it and transport the minerals to a gathering point. These NPCs should be VERY expensive (read: almost null profit margin), so that they do not force players out of the occupation they fill. The NPCs should be there to mitigate a lack of interest in an occupation, not cause players to not participate in those occupations. They should also be vulnerable. In addition to hiring these NPC workers, you would either need to personally guard them, or hire guards to protect them from dangers of the wild and or bandits, etc.
You should have a visual tool to customize almost everything in game via dyes, paint, etc. (These should all be professions/skills.)
Every action should be taken to combat bots and macros and afk exploiters.
Dedicated staff who play specific roles in the game and are hugely important to the main city. Think about how awesome it would be to have every important character in the main city interactive because there's a player behind it. They would have specific mandated goals and roles, but be free to make new decisions as the game progresses...
Local chat, Mail system. No global, no trade, no guild chat.
Module construction/building. You should be able to build walls, floors, roofs, windows, doors, etc and create whatever buildings you want... And if you don't build it properly, you can watch it fall apart, or have it fall apart on you...

I love open world games like Fallout and TES series, sweet little games like Machinarium and Bastion and some casual fun like Worms.
Thing is, when I played Fallout, TES, Borderlands, HOMM 3, Civilization, I was in college and therefor could invest sleepless nights in gaming. Now I work from 9 to 5 and can't do such thing.
I've read that Dark Souls is a great game, but most people recommend it for its complexity and rewarding combat mechanics, not the atmosphere and overall feeling. Most of them complained about the simplicity of Skyrim. I also thought Skyrim was too simple, but it still had a nice atmosphere, soundtrack and that sense of freedom. And TES lore of course. Now, I would sort of like a game where you don't have to be a hardcore gamer to succeed, but rather just enjoy the game.
So, I've rambled a bit, but the question remains. I started playing Dark Souls(on PC with a controller) and from the start it looks like something I would have to invest many hours to get good at. Is it worth it? I don't care about how awesomely difficult the swordplay is, I just want a nice environment and a good story.
Could you suggest other good, but not too demanding games? Really anything except generic first person shooters with a linear story.
At the moment, I've been playing Borderlands 2, but by the time I reached level 25, it got a bit repetitive and boring. I might pick that up though some time.

Some time ago I got to play Dear Esther and shortly after that also Stanley Parable. I was absolutely enchanted by the way their creators experimented with storytelling to create something completely different; little works of art presented in the much underappreciated medium that is video games.

Does anyone know any other games with experimental storytelling? To be honest I'm not that much into gameplay and more into the *experience* of the game, very much how Dear Esther had virtually no gameplay as such.

Seeing as the title will probably be confusing, I'll go into further detail here. One of my abso-freaking-lute favorite games ever is the Shivering Isles expansion for Oblivion. In fact I'm fairly certain I spent more time in that than I did in the main story. Why is that, you may ask?

The thing I loved most about Shivering Isles is that it gave you choices. You could go down the path of the Demented, you could go down the path of the Manic, you could mix and match the two, and your choices were more for aesthetic (the Sacellum for example) and preferred boosts here and there (which units you command, which armor/items you get, how the Gatekeeper buffs, etc.) rather than changing the outcome of the game. You could play it over and over and rarely make the same choices twice if you so desired. The choices weren't ""good"" or ""bad"", they were ""A"" or ""B"" and the choices didn't change the overall story but rather certain elements of it.

Are there any other games that do that kind of thing? I would love it if there were, but everything seems to be about moral choices.

What are other games I'd like, based on what and why I like what I like?    
  
These are in no order, though MGS3 is my favorite game of all time. Feel free to suggest stuff from any time period, not just limited to games right now. Keep in mind that I might not have played a common game.    

  
  
**GAMES I LIKE A LOT**  
Okami - amazing stylization, world changes while you rescue it, cool powers and use of those, hidden stuff. It's just a really grand adventure full of giant and ominous things and captures 'culture' really well (through specific instruments and settings).  
  
.  
  

Metal Gear Solid 3 (series) - I don't think I need to explain why I like MGS3. Everything is incredible. Perfect stealth, difficulty, characters (Boss was the coolest relationship to another character I've seen in a game), variability, boss fights, plot, levels as they relate to stealth, etc. In terms of whole series, sometimes plot gets too convoluted, but I can look past that because the game is that fun.
  
.  
  
Viewtiful Joe - Arcade-y rule type gameplay. It's kind of like Scream, it's the same thing it's parodying. Lots of stylization, lots of attention to detail, cool use of powers.
  
.    
  

Braid - Mind bending genius puzzles with the coolest ending I've ever seen, with a nice folklore style behind it. What other game forces you to think in non-linear time?
  
.  
  

Portal - Game makes really good uses(aka puzzles) out of a feature that I've dreamed of (portaling). Runs super smooth and is just plain fun to use. It's also like a semi-horror movie, like the Cube. Just trapped in a room, and all you have is a robot voice as a companion. Who knows who the good guy or bad guy or whatever is, it's just you and surviving.  
  
.  
  


GTA San Andreas - I've always liked street gang things, and there's just so much you can do in this game. It's also semi silly, the cheats add a lot to it, and great controls. Missions were pretty varied as well. I hated GTA4.  
  
.  
  


Wind Waker - I love the sailing, the art (kiddie cel shading looked really nice), and just going around on a boat being a pirate. Awesome music, cool dungeons, all that LoZ stuff except it didn't get as stale (though I'm not even done with it yet, but I do like it more than I've enjoyed the Zelda's I have played).  
  
.  
  


God of War (series) - I like Greek mythology, and the story is actually a pretty nice classical Greek tragedy. The gameplay is also really smooth, everything you do combos (even though light light heavy or heavy heavy heavy was the main thing I ever did), grand boss battles, nice variety on enemies and what they do, cool little things that break up the game (like chain swinging or platforming bits or whatever). It's a great story with really nice controls and variety behind it.  
  
.  
  


Kingdom Hearts (1 2) - Travelling across Disney worlds, getting to be a part of some of my favorite characters/movies of all time? Amazing. Each world had it's own style to it as well. Great music behind it as well, and the combat was at least interesting enough. Cool looking enemies, enemies ranged from cute to dark-awesome, get some cool abilities, all that RPG stuff.  
  
.  
  


Parappa the Rapper - What a music game should be. It gives you a template of what a song is, and you play whatever you'd like with it. If it sounds good, the game rewards you. I think Parappa was too lenient, sometimes randomly mashing stuff was also considered good, but the point remains that I can still do whatever I want to the song. I also like the style a lot. It's just a cute and silly game, from story (conflicts and characters) to song basis.

Shadow of the Colossus - Dream like world, vague but intriguing backstory/mystery, but most importantly, the grandness of the boss fights and the almost intuitive cool puzzle-like effect of taking them down. There were times in the game where I tried something overly complex to try and beat a boss, and I knew it was too complex thanks to the game just needing you to think a little more. Nice consequential puzzles. And holy s*** were some of those bosses epic.  
  
.  
  



Phoenix Wright - It's silly, but I feel like a badass when all the other guy can do is just cower in fear at my God levels of logic mwahaha (I like that about fighting games too). It actually makes me interact with it (while being a cool lawyer in the process), whereas any other visual novel is just making random stupid decisions. It's really a logic-puzzle game at heart, like Braid (except Braid goes beyond our dimension).  
  
.  
  


Super Mario World - Just everything good about Mario games. Great enemies, memorable level design, teasing secrets, great music to reflect what's going on, nice power ups. Really kind of does feel like a world, cause the levels have some base with how the world is.  
  
.  
  


Super Mario 64 - I thought it was really neat that all you had was just a tiny hint of where the Star could be, and from there you just have to explore and notice differences in the level. Tight controls, great music, etc. The overworld was also really awesome too.  
  
.  
  


Donkey Kong Country 2 - Everything about SMW, except DKC2 had the DK coin, which is the coolest collectible ever. As the levels went on, the placement started getting trickier, and as Sirlin has said (great article), I actually did kind of start to think of where the developer might put it next. It's like developer vs player first, and awesome platformer after.  
  
.  
  


Megaman 9 - Tight controls and the game put you in specific situations that required you to make the most out of your character. Whenever you die, you know exactly what went wrong. It's never a random death. (same thing I like about fighting games, though sometimes there is randomness. It's hard to describe)  
  
.  
  


Spiderman 2 - The great swinging mechanic with free world. Really that's it. I'd play (and can still play) this game and just swing around doing Spidey favors for random civilians for hours at a time. I felt like Spiderman, yo.  
  
.  
  


Bioshock - Lots and lots of detail to a really interesting and awesome world. There's also cool powerups you get. I'm only halfway done with this game so far. I lost it, so I need to rebuy it. I didn't like Fallout 3 because it was way too open and I felt like I was just doing sidequests that were disguised as just grinding/fetching quests a lot of the time.

My favorite part of most games is the prep-work; researching and min/max-ing different characters. Sometimes I enjoy this part more than the actual game.


For example, in League of Legends I'd spend more time looking at different item sets and talent point/rune builds than actually playing the game. I wasn't very good at it either...

In Dark Souls I have a few fully built characters with upgraded weapons and armor. I don't really have the urge to beat the game with them or PvP, but I enjoyed ""finishing"" them.

I love Magic the Gathering; one of my favorite parts of the game is deck building. Even if I don't get to play that often, I still love researching new cards and figuring out how they could make my old decks better. (I really like the board/card game Dominion for this same reason)

What i liked about the game was that the learning curve is not too steep. Eg Europe Universalis has a really steep learning curve which puts me off really quickly. I'm a casual gamer so I don't want to read manuals for hours before hitting the game.

Also money is a problem. I can't really afford a game so it'll have to be under 20$ and no monthly payments. The newest games will not run on my system (hitman absolution is i think the limit of my machine).

I'm looking for a game where a single playing session has lasting influence. Red Alert, for example, is just play a map, start again, play a map, start again. Rome TW campaign is longer which makes it more fun for me.  Warcraft III has the same issue, though you advance in a campaign, each next map is just starting over again. Another great casual game is Transport Tycoon or Minecraft but i've noticed that both lack enough direction for me).

but i noticed in total war that after a while i autoplayed most battles, even city sieges. Only when i was heavily outnumbered would i take control to limit the damage.

So looking at my options now, i'm inclined to go for another game in the TW series (if the squalor issue si dealt with). Which one should i get? Rome TW 2 is too expensive and i'm not sure if it would run on my machine.

i thought medieval total war was too similar to Rome. Can anybody contrast Shogun 2, Empire, and Napoleon? Maybe another campaign like strategy is an option?

I'd appreciate if there was some form of online playing, but i'm not sure if that would work with my casual approach (1-6 hours a week). I'd probably get my ass kicked by more serious gamers.

In conclusion, i'm looking for a game in a (semi) persistent world with a low threshold money and learning-curve wise. it can be a RTS, but i'm open to other suggestions too. I'd also appreciate a comparison between different TW games (i know Rome, have some experience with medieval). 

Edit: i really liked puzzle pirates too, except that it after a while you had to pay to continue growing. I might be interested in a game where you can work yourself to the top, but where i stay a low level footsoldier stopping by from time to time (as long as i'd have some degree of freedom and interesting stuff to do).

What's important is that the atmosphere has to be good (some warm atmosphere, I don't like these games in cold areas and vast landscapes, rather crowded and warm or medieval, like with cities and stuff e.g.), the engine should be nice (like smooth movement and animations and such), the gameplay should fit (like that it's fun to play or motivation to play, etc.) and additionally a good story wouldn't harm.

Some games I enjoyed were: Assassin's Creed 1&amp;2, BioShock series, Civilization series, DotA2, Company of Heroes, Gothic 1 and 2 (favourite games), Far Cry 3, Binding of Isaac, Half-Life, Portal series, Don't Starve, Shogun 2, Orcs Must Die!, Evil Genius, Overlord series, The Witcher 2, Crazy Taxi, to give you a little impression

* Skyrim
* Mass Effect 1
* Borderlands 2 (Some people might not call this an RPG, but what ever)
* Fallout 3

My favorite of all of these is easily Skyrim.

I played ME1 for only like the first two missions but I couldn't get into it that much and I didn't have much time to play it (I rented it for something like 3 days). Maybe I should give that another look or something? I'm not sure.

Borderlands 2 and FO3 I did not really enjoy that much or if not, then I didn't enjoy them at all. I know they're two completely different games and it's unfair to put them together. But I don't like the idea of always having to be concerned about running around paying attention to my health, looking for bullets etc. Sure Skyrim kind of did that, but you looted for either stronger weapons or better armor. I was rewarded for going through dead bodies; I didn't go through bodies to find something I'll just waste and need more again such as bullets.

I'm here for a suggestion for a PC game. I'm looking after a game with grinding, but doesn't require a lot of mechanical skill like mouse accuracy or good reflexes.

I have serious problems playing Moba type games, so those are excluded. I also can't manage to play platformers, like the new Rogue Legacy for example (i'm level 43 in it and i find it frustratingly hard). 

I also find it annoying to play 2-3 hours on a mission just to fail it and have to start it all over ,and i generally dislike games that demand to end an objective or a mission in a strict single way with deadlines. (Had those two problems on heroes of might and magic campaigns)

Having a storyline is a bonus, but is not a must.

But this is not so obvious to everyone, despite the fact it's an exceedingly good idea. Maybe a paragraph containing guidelines to this effect could be added to the sidebar?

I can't finish Bioshock Infinite because pure (single player) FPS games are boring as hell to me.  The entirety of their mechanics/tricks-of-the-trade are introduced to you in the first 5 min (actually... make that 20 years ago) and the only thing pushing you from then on is the story.

I can't finish a Total War campaign anymore because once I've seen a faction's interesting units I don't have any motivation to continue.

I couldn't finish Dishonored because once I toyed around with most of the abilities I realized the only thing left was to plod through the missions.  And they were alright, but nothing groundbreaking.  The story was the usual video-game-dross that has been done a million times over in other mediums.

I couldn't finish Skyrim because.. well it sucked overall.  But I couldn't finish it once I hit around level 30 and I realized there was no challenge and no big, groundbreaking new gameplay elements for me to discover.  I had my magic, I had some crazy armors, I had some crazy weapons, and I've seen dragons/dragon priests, most of the game world, etc.

So I think the problem is that once I've seen a game's novel elements and all that's left for me is to complete the game for completion's sake, I just can't will myself to do it.

Are there any games that don't have this problem?  Are there any games that introduce genuinely new mechanics/aspects throughout the story, so that I can finally finish a game? 

Also, and this isn't THAT important, but are there any NEW games that fall under this category?  I bought this great gaming pc and all I do is play old shit like KOTOR, SNES/PS1 ROMs, etc. for nostalgia's sake because most modern games bore the hell out of me.

Borderlands 1 allows splitscreen OR online, but not both, for instance.

The only games we've found that allow both are the various Halos, L4D, and Borderlands 2. Halo gets boring quick, so we've been playing the fuck out of Borderlands 2... but we need some variety.

Alternately, if you have any really good fun-friendly competitive games that fit the bill, those would be appreciated.

Please help!,jgortner,9,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/132tlc/tabletop_dd_group_needs_digital_rpg_game_to_play/,"Hi everyone,

Our Dungeons and Dragons group (pen and paper tabletop group) can no longer meet because of distance reasons.  We're open to any and all suggestions with the following being some of the attributes we're looking for.

* We can cooporatively play together
* There is a progression / advancement of charater, unit, or whatever
* Highly replayable whether it be finishing a ""campaign"" (or equivallent) and starting a new one or a game that doesn't really end
* Isn't just button mashing (ie. Diablo 3)
* Doesn't require a brand new computer to run (PC game)

Numerous MMORPG games might fit the bill here but we need one that doesn't stress spending a TON of time in game. We're probably going to meet once a week.  So MMOs are welcome as a suggestion but please state why your suggestion fits the bill well. But also feel free to recommend outside of this space as well.

Also if anyone knows of a **robust** online system that moreso emulates the tabletop RPG experience that is welcome too.  However, none of us really have much time to DM so this is probably not viable.

Thanks!

Sorry if this isn't exactly the right subreddit for this question, but I figure it's close enough.

Over the past few months I've really grown to respect and love some old games that I had never really considered before for the sole purpose that they were old.  It started when I decided to finally give Vampire: The Masquerade a try and I fucking LOVED it.  So, I figured to go even older, and looked into Planescape: Torment, which is touted as one of the best (if not the best) RPG of all time.

I'm only about two hours in - definitely not far enough to form any real opinions about the game - and I'm trying to give it a chance, but it really just isn't *grabbing* me.  It has nothing to do with the way the game is set up - I'm an avid reader, so the concept of an RPG that's more focused on text sounded great to me.  And I love the dialogue!  It's refreshing and fun, and I can see why people love this game.  But it just hasn't *grabbed* me yet, and I think a big part of that might be the fact that I've never really played a top down RPG like that before, and I'm a little put off by the fact that the game really just feels dated to me.  

So I'm wondering if I should give Baldur's Gate a try. Is it different enough from Planescape that it might just click better with me, providing me a better segway into a genre that's pretty well-aged?  I really do see the potential in these games, so I don't want to dismiss them as being too old before I give them the fair shot they deserve.",,False,,t5_2sxyv,False,,,True,t3_11zmi9,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/11zmi9/should_i_try_baldurs_gate_instead/,

Sorry for all the text but I thought I should be thorough.* 


I'm a 23 year old girl, and I'm sort of new to 'proper' gaming. I'm not even sure if this is something that will stick.

 I had a SNES and a PS1 growing up and only had all of the Donkey Kong and Mario games for SNES; Gex, Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, Harry Potter and Tekken for the PS1. We were poor, I felt grateful just to have the consoles at all. Anyway, I immersed myself in them, and I do love playing video games. 

I never learnt to use joysticks and I have some trouble with them, they don't come naturally to me but I'm trying. I find a lot of games on newer consoles pretty hard because of this, but I'm hoping practise will fix it. 

* I have a SNES again now and don't really know what games to get for it, other than having rebought the ones I grew up with.
 
*   I have a Wii but only have New Super Mario Bros, Donkey Kong Returns, Animal Crossing, Paper Mario etc. 

* I have a N64 but no games as of yet. I've never played this console, so I don't know what is good or not. 

* I have a Gamecube, same deal as the N64. It has never left its box. I don't think I've ever even touched one or seen one plugged in. I know nothing.

* I have a PS1 and PS2, only game I have is Tomba. 

* Nintendo DS, only braintraining games and Cooking Mama.

* PSP, no games.

* Gameboy Advance, no games.
* SEGA Genesis, no games. I liked Aladdin and Ecco for this, but I was maybe 14 at most last time I played them. 

* I didn't mind but didn't particularly like Doom for the PC, same with Penumbra. Loved WoW, Limbo, Princess Maker, Angry Birds etc and like Facebook gaming (please don't judge!) other than the social aspect.

* Bought a PS3 today because I love playing on my sister-in-laws. Got Heavy Rain, LA Noire, Assassins Creed and Bayonetta because I know I love them from playing hers. Also got Infamous, De Blob, Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3, Little Big Planet and Ratchet and Clank because I had to start a collection somewhere and they all looked interesting. Debated getting Lollipop Chainsaw and Tales of Graces F but decided I was taking enough chances with my money for one day. 


TL;DR - looking for games on a variety of consoles, I'm not terribly good at anything post-SNES yet but I'd like to try. And I'm awesome on the SNES. Last controller that ever felt natural.

**My favourite games are Limbo, the Donkey Kong series, Mario series, Heavy Rain, Prince of Persia, Assassins Creed, Bayonetta, Little Big Planet, LA Noire, Crash Bandicoot series and Harry Potter series. I love platformers and sidescrollers. I'm not social so I don't even know what is out there, so please don't leave something out because it seems obvious or 'what everyone says/knows'**

2.  Can you use mods on the steam version, and do they work on multi-player?

3.  What DLC's are worth getting, if any?

I realized recently that I miss that style of combat system. All these new games have gotten away from anything turn-based. I'm all for progress, but sometimes I'd like a throwback to the classics.

I was looking for a new game (2010-2012) that uses a similar combat system to what got me hooked on RPGs to begin with. I like how most intricacies are spelled out for me to quickly determine what strategy to use.

I almost despise these new games where I can't really figure out how damage is calc'd until I'm almost done with the game. Now that I have responsibilities and shit, I don't have the kind of time needed to invest in discovering why my badass weapons aren't bringing about the murderfest I thought they would. Some hidden effects are okay, but there's definitely a line that's been getting crossed a lot recently.

Also, I'll note that I'm aware Japan puts out a few of these games every year. However, most of these games aren't exactly my style. If there is one that doesn't involve a 15 year old kid and his buxom anime friends singing their way to justice, I might be interested in it.

While I'm at it, I'll go ahead and say that I also miss the definitive rewards for sidequests. A chest/accomplishment that I need to revisit/redo because the percentages weren't in my favor is bullshit. Once again, I ain't got time for that nonsense, give me my shit and let me get back to the game.

You have limited resources, and you have to balance out what you spend resources on, such as progression, aquiring more resources, staying alive, etc.

I'm not really talking about any specific genre of games here, as long as this element is present, and the game has a reasonably decent interface (i'm not patient enough to learn another dwarf fortress-interface)

Some examples to better explain what i mean:  
   
* Nethack: You start with very little, and have to try to find good weapons, tools, magic rings and amulets, while gathering food to stay alive and carefully considering what to use your potions, wands and scrolls for.  
* Dwarf fortress: You start with only 7 dwarves and a small stockpile. While trying to survive you gather more and more materials to build a nice pimp fortress.  
* Command &amp; Conquer (1): In the harder late game levels, you only have a few units, an MCV and very limited credits. Almost every tiberium field is guarded, and you are under constant attack. This means you have to prioritize defense, teching up, and fighting for tiberium.  
* Minecraft: In the early game, you have to search for valuable materials, chose what to spend them on, and try to build a decent stronghold all at the same time as farming food to stay fed. This is way better with for instance industrial craft.  

Most of 4x games also contain this element, but i'd like something not too complicated. I also really love older games. The direction newer games have taken with interface, animation and other fanciness slows down the gameplay a lot. I'm not saying NO NEW GAMES, just that i'm fine with older ones.

After watching EVO and seeing the awesome SSF fights, I wanted to start playing a fighting game LIKE SSF, but which also has MMO aspects and character progression.  

I did my fair share of searching and already tried these games:  
- LaTale -&gt; Clunky controlls/outdated  
- Rusty Hearts -&gt; Nonexistent PvP playerbase  
- Grand Chase -&gt; Outdated  
- Rumble Fighter -&gt; Outdated  
- Elsword -&gt; Outdated/clunky  
- Lost Saga -&gt; Didn't like PvP system  
- Dragon Nest -&gt; Not bad but missing something  
 
None of these really had that ""X Factor"" that I was looking for. I can't really pinpoint exactly WHAT I'm looking for, but none of those games really stuck with me.
 
I'm currently trying out RIFT, and thats turning out alright at best. The PvP early game isn't as balanced as I would have hoped and smurfs completely ruin gameplay (gear is extremely important).
 
In essence, I'm looking for a very PvP heavy game WITH ranking and some sort of character progression be it MMO style or something else. To clarify, I like the idea of getting new gear, levels, etc.
 
I know this might be impossible/too vague, but any help at all would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks so much guys

1372249536.0,5,self.gamingsuggestions,1h3qng,Discussion: Make an offical GvG-setting in Guild Wars 2 (It's already in the name of the game),Elder_Sang,14,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1h3qng/discussion_make_an_offical_gvgsetting_in_guild/,"I would like to make a proposal to integrate a feature into GW2 that already exist from the player community.
I mean, It is after all GUILD WARS and there isn't a setting for Guild versus Guild

**My proposal : Cross-Server GvG**


**Why**

There are world-wide a bunch of Guilds who have their focus primarily on World versus World. Most of them like it for the tactics, wiping bigger groups with you small group, roaming, fighting real wars against real opponents, conquer castles and keeps. Everyone who has ever seen films like LOTR 2 wants to be in the battle of helmsdeep or LOTR 3 the fight for Minas Tirith, where small armies destroy the huge army of Sauron (ok, the army of the undead was a little OP).

I have been in WvW from the start, been commanding ever since. I’ve seen the shift between going for points and be the strongest server, towards guilds that want to have good fights. Lots of guilds hate the lag, hate the blobs of +100 people in T1, hate queues, but have to stay in a top 9 tier server to encounter other guilds of the same level and have the epic fights they are thriving for.

As you can see on [www.gw2gvg.com](http://www.gw2gvg.com) there are atm 59 EU-guilds and 39 US-guilds who are organizing their own unofficial GvG’s. This is not that easy because you have to trust the honesty of your opponents, it’s a lot of work to organize a GvG, AND you can’t fight every guild you want due to the fact you are stuck to a server, so you will never know who is the strongest guild. Certainly not between US and EU servers.

A possible solution could be guesting a server and then entering WvW, but we all know that this will lead to more spying in the normal WvW, so this is out of the question. Switching servers is not a solution, it’s 2 costly after a while, certainly if you have to bring over +30 people every time. People won’t do it and this will result in the death of the GvG-scene or could lead to abuse of external resources (buying ingame money).The only way to really compete at this time is you gather all WvW/GvG-guilds in the same three servers, which means you destroy the WvW on those servers (to much people on it, lags, queues, unplayable, look at matchups with Vizunah) and destroy the WvW on the other servers (why try if we never will beat those three servers).


**Proposal**

I propose the making of a Cross-server GvG-structure, where all the guilds from all over the world can participate at. It should be possible in the current setting, otherwise guesting wouldn’t be possible.
The advantage of this project is that you can take several existing elements from other parts of GW2 and adapt them a bit. I will give some examples.

*The score table/leaderboard*

* This is already used in WvW, PvP, sPvP, tPvP. Another list based on these isn’t hard to do

*Terrain options*

* You can make very easy-going terrains. The most beautiful example is the terrain in WvW where the GvG’s are currently held between SE and SW spawn. It has to be mainly open terrain, some soft slopes/hard slopes, nothing to fancy. The setting at that place is beautiful, with the mountain, the water, the little forest and the mill.
* No need for capturing points as the purpose is to just wipe the other team
* That area is precisely right if you look at the size, enough place to move around, retreat and heal up, etc. It doesn’t have to be bigger then that.
* The coliseum of Rome could be a nice setting

*Starting point*

* Something like the PvP-area where you can form your teams. Or something like in GW1 with the guild mansion.
* The people of those teams go and stand on a portal and one person of each party start the countdown for his party.
* You spawn like you do in PvP-arena, but also like in dragon ball arena or similar.
* This way you can limit the number of players who join the battle, and you have to be in a party of at least 4 to be able to enter.
* Once you enter the portal you get to a spawn point. After the start the spawn point stays open for 30s. If you are not out it closes and you can’t play that round.
* Guild-keeps could be implemented, the system will load an empty instance with one guild's keep on one side and the other guild's keep on the other in a '2 forts' style fashion

**Rules**

* To participate you have to be part of the guild (wear the tag + represent)
* Only an officer can start the GvG.
* You have to choose between 15v15 / 20v20 / 25v25. Ofcourse, both guilds have to choose the same number.
*You can not go random (perhaps later) you can contact the guild contact who is on the leaderboard next to the guild.
* Only format is death match, every opponent has to be dead. You can die completely twice. If you get resurrected you can participate again. The third time you die completely you get portaled back to your spawn and you cannot enter anymore for that round. 
* You can choose if stacks received in the fight can be used, but at the start of a GvG every stack will be gone.
* Win = every opponent is dead. First to get 10 wins gains victory in that GvG.

**Advantages**

There are several advantages to implementing this system.

* Less players will be leaving GW2 due to the new challenge.
* Less server switch, which makes the total WvW-scene much more attractable and more stable.
* The level of WvW will rise, Guilds will use WvW as a training ground, resulting in even more beautiful battles. GvG will only count as the real competition.
* Guilds can fight guilds of their own server too.
* There is no real reward. Or nothing especially designed for GvG. It’s for the glory of being the best GvG-guild in the world.

**Possible Expansions**

GvGvGvG

* A map were guilds are all enemy of eachother, and you find people who want to fight as a guild, not versus keeps and doors. This means a little bit large map and 4 spawnpoints on each side with no real advantage from either spawnpoint.

I hope A-net reads this plea. Please do make suggestions to improve this idea even more and vote it up if you would love this feature as hard as I do. I don’t mind criticism, but please make it so I can use stuff you say.

I have spent more than 1200 hours on it, but I find that even when I haven't gotten bored of it yet, I would like a few other games to play before I get bored with Dark Souls.

One major part of Dark Souls I enjoyed (and enjoy in any game) is that it didn't patronise me. It didn't tell me what I was going up against, and didn't hold my hand throughout the entire game. You can't even pause the game. I love this. Plenty of modern games nowadays will hold your hand in places where it thinks you will struggle, and some games even go so far as to not let you into a difficult area because it is simply not confident in the player's abilities.

Another part of Dark Souls I enjoyed was how deep it was. Something a lot of modern games fail to capture your attention for more than a few months (ahem, Call of Duty), yet Dark Souls held my attention for a year (and counting).

I also love difficulty in games. I hate to brag, but I do consider myself, within reason, to be pretty good at Dark Souls. I would not consider myself a ""hardcore"" gamer, but I have found that difficulty is relative. Would Dark Souls be considered hard if all games were as hard as Dark Souls, and it's difficulty was what most people consider today to be normal? No. People would be used to it.

So, what other games do you guys think I will enjoy? Other games I have played (and finished) include Demon's Souls and Super Meat Boy. Both of those games are really hard and are non-patronising. I don't really have much concern with graphics, I have played plenty of roguelikes (and loved them), as well as Dwarf Fortress (and I would like to hear your comments about it), and I don't really mind exactly how difficult a game is, although difficulty is a bonus. And, no, I am not a masochist, I simply love the feeling of accomplishment after overcoming a huge difficulty. I also dislike a game patronising me.

Super Nintendo,Azarius,8,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1df2y0/shadowrun_genesis_vs_super_nintendo/,"I see that they're planning on releasing a sequel to the Shadowrun games on SNES and Genesis, with funds from a Kickstarter campaign. I have never played Shadowrun, besides that awful Xbox 360 game, so I don't have experience, whatsoever. But, I have currently gained some interest in this new title and I would like to go back and play the old ones, so I have a good idea what the games are about. 



Now, my question is, which one is really the *better* game and *worthwhile* playing game?



From what I have read the SNES version is said to have a better story, superior graphics, great music, etc, but some people still say that the Genesis version is the best. Is this just nostalgia for some people or is the SNES version really the better one? I also head that the Genesis version stay more true to the tabletop  RPG (which I have no experience with.)



Just looking for some heads-up on this. Not too sure of which one to pick up. Any input is welcome



Thanks!



Edit: I'd like to add that I learn more towards story-oriented games. If it's got a good story, then I'm all about it.
Also, music. Music is a big thing for me in games.



Update: Picked up Shadowrun for the Genesis yesterday for $30.

Suggestions?*

A group of friends and I are looking for a group game to play on our computers during the upcoming summer break. We'll be across the country - perhaps across the world, at times - and not all of us will have access to top-end machines. Also, we're all looking for slightly different things in this game, but we're keeping ourselves open-minded. We might not all be able to come on at the same time, and there are maybe 10 of us at most.

We could go for a game where we all work together cooperatively towards a goal or where we play competitively against one another; where we play in parallel towards independent or smaller-group goals; where we all play at the same time or where we all play whenever we can get online into some kind of overworld. Not *absolutely* anything, but we're looking for whatever kind of fun multiplayer experience we can get. We have varying skill levels and familiarity with different games, but we're hoping for fun for everyone.

Some ideas that we've come up with, although they don't all strictly adhere to the guides above:

* World of Warcraft/ Other WoW-like MMORPG

* Minecraft

* Pokemon MMO

* League of Legends/Other MOBAs (Heroes of Newerth, DoTA2, etc)

* Starcraft: Brood War/ Starcraft 2

* Diablo III/Other action-RPG (Torchlight, Path of Exile, etc)

* Age of Empires 2 HD/Other ""Age of"" RTSs (Mythology, or regular AoE2X so that Mac users can play - unless we convince them to bootcamp)

* Team Fortress 2

* Left 4 Dead/2

* Borderlands 2

* Crusader Kings/Europa Universalis III

* Civilization 5

(I suggested giving Monaco a try, although I've gotten no support so far. I also suggested passing around a Dwarf Fortress game, but that's a difficult game to tackle. Also, most of the highly competitive games listed above we'd play just amongst ourselves, although we'd of course look into how we fair against other people.)

So what do you think, /r/Games? Any glaring omissions, or helpful perspectives? We haven't had much time to play games recently, especially not as a group, and we won't have much time to invest outside of this summer. 

Right now, parallel Nuzlockes in the Pokemon MMO, Minecraft, TF2, and L4D/2 are our top picks. League is also gaining traction. 

*Edit:* Other suggesions:

* SimCity (Mixed feelings about this game, paying into always-on, awful DRM, etc. Also, smaller scope compared to previous SimCity's, but we do get multiplayer, eh?)

* Star Wars: The Old Republic

* Terraria

* Monaco (again, it's back on motherfuckers)",,False,,t5_2sxyv,1367203951.0,,,True,t3_1dazxm,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1dazxm/what_are_some_good_multiplayer_games_to_play_with/,

I figured instead of making a bunch of posts asking for games fitting these themes, I'd just combine it all into one. Themes are listed in no particular order. If you can recommend a game fitting any of them, please do!    

**1 - Games that would trigger fear of open water, claustrophobia, or fear of heights**  

I have an intense fear of open water to the point that swimming more than a short distance in Skyrim makes my skin crawl, so I'm looking for games taking place underwater to trigger that fear. Big, scary sea creatures are a bonus. I'm also claustrophobic and afraid of heights, so I'm also interested in any game that would trigger those fears.  

**2 - Psychological horror games**  

Pure gore and jumping scares don't do it for me, in movies or games, so I'm looking for real psychological horror games to scare the living crap out of me.  

**3 - Open world games**  

I have Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout NV, GTA VC and SA, and I already know of Far Cry 3. Are there any games I'm missing? Not just for PC, but consoles and handhelds as well.  

**4 - RPGs**  

Bonus points if it's for PSP or a system I can emulate on PSP (mainly SNES, GB/GBC/GBA). I enjoy playing my PSP while I'm on the elliptical and it's difficult to play games requiring precise button presses while moving. Game mechanics similar to Pokemon (turn- and menu-based combat) are preferable.  

**5 - Games with unique gameplay**  

I only recently got my PSP so I'm discovering all of the neat games for it for the first time - Patapon, Loco Roco and the like. I really enjoy games like this that deviate from standard gameplay.  

**6 - Rhythm games**  

I'm currently hooked on Patapon and Taiko no Tatsujin Portable DX. What other rhythm games are out there? I've played all of the Rhythm Heaven games.  

**7 - Lesser-known games/your favorite games/whatever you want to recommend**  

I'm open to anything, basically. I play all types of games, from FPS to MOBA to puzzle to horror to music to visual novel to platform... *anything*.   

Also, anyone know of more games like Bushido Blade that don't have a health bar for combat?",,False,,t5_2sxyv,False,,,True,t3_1d6scq,http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1d6scq/looking_for_all_kinds_of_suggestions/,

So i am now looking for something similar that will fill the gap.

 I've recently played BFBC2 and MW2 just to have something to play, and while it can be fun it it doesn't really do it for me, what i'm looking for is a game with high skill ceiling, both movement and twitch reflexes/aiming, with good mapdesign, balance and gamemodes. The closest mw2 and BF comes to that is twitch aiming and quickscoping, not very entertaining in the long run.


 I've been thinking about quake live and other similar titles, but i feel im a bit late to the party, those are all small and dedicated communities with competitive players who have been playing for years, a bit hard to get into. 


The only real option that i've found so far is shootmania, and while i'm sure it is fun when you get into it, it still looks a bit stale and samey, and would probably grow old pretty fast. And i also like it if there is a more casual side to the game, so i can just jump in and have some fun without going all tryhard mode every once in a while. 

This is sort of my last effort to try and find a game that will work for me, it seems impossible to find anything else than military shooters or just more casual, funoriented indie shooters these days.
