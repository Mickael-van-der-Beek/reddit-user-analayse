From the Jane English Translation:
Twenty-One
----
    Do you think you can take over the universe and improve it?
    I do not believe it can be done.
    
    The universe is sacred.
    You cannot improve it.
    If you try to change it, you will ruin it.
    If you try to hold it, you will lose it.
    
    So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;
    Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;
    Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;
    Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.
    
    Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.

Detachment means to have neither regrets for the past nor fears for the future; to let life take its course without attempting to interfere with its movement and change, neither trying to prolong the stay of things pleasant nor to hasten the departure of things unpleasant. To do this is to move in time with life, to be in perfect accord with its changing music, and this is called Enlightenment. In short, it is to be detached from both past and future and to live in the eternal Now; by themselves they are illusions. Life exists only at this very moment, and in this moment it is infinite and eternal. For the present moment is infinitely small; before we can measure it, it has gone, and yet it persists for ever. This movement and change has been called Dao by the Chinese, yet in fact there is no movement, for the moment is the only reality and there is nothing beside it in relation to which it can be said to move. Thus it can be called at once the eternally moving and eternally resting. 

How can we bring ourselves in accord with this Dao? A sage has said that if we *try* to accord with it, we shall get away from it. But he was not altogether right. For the curious thing is that you cannot get out of accord with it even if you want to; though your thoughts may run into the past or the future they cannot escape the present moment. However far back or forward they try to escape they can never be separated from the moment, for those thoughts are themselves of the moment; just as much as anything else they partake of, and, indeed, *are* the movement of life which is Dao. You may believe yourself out of harmony with life and its eternal Now; but you cannot be, for you are life and exist now--otherwise you would not be here. Hence the infinite Dao is something which you can neither escape by flight nor catch by pursuit; there is no coming toward it or going away from it; it *is*, and you are it. So become what you are.""

problems with our friends or family, we blame the other 
person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will 
grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive 
effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason

Well anyways, today it was windier than normal with overcast skies and a light misting of rain, but I decided to run despite the conditions. While on my run I was running upwind with the rain pelting pelting my face, making me squint in an attempt to ward off the water droplets. The squinting hurt my head after a while and then I realized I was trying to work against the rain and its Inner Nature. I opened my eyes, and while I struggled keeping them open at first, by the end of the run I was able to keep my eyes open effortlessly. After my ""awakening"", whenever the rain hit me, it started to cool me down, in fact it was very relaxing and refreshing.

**Once I started accepting the rain, it no longer bothered me.**

Anyways, I guess its pretty small and simple, but it was a big deal for me to put Wu Wei into action into an aspect of my life I would have never considered implementing a Taoist principle in otherwise.

Up to this point all I needed to do to get him to do something he didn't want to do was to gently insist, for the most part.  And if he really didn't want to do something, I didn't make him.  But this was no longer working, so it was time to introduce discipline.  Although my primary motivation was that he learn to behave well, part of my motivation for introducing discipline was the ego-driven thought, ""I refuse to be a weak parent.""

So I started to discipline him.  When he refused to wash his hands, or brush his teeth, I would tell him in a stern tone, ""do it now.""  At first he would do it, but then he wanted to test it, and would say, ""No.""  At this, I knew it was imperative to stand my ground at all costs.  So I would repeat my command, and when he did not obey, I would get angry, adopt a still harsher tone, and put him in timeout in his room and close the door.

When he began to cry I would feel bad and let him out, I would speak soothingly to him, and he would do as I asked.  

But then before long he began to cry all the time, after I asked him to do anything.  So I asked around and according to a couple of ""experts"" he was crying because I rewarded it, so the solution was to put him in timeout for crying as well.

The first time I did this was very hard for both of us.  He cried and screamed vehemently for 45 minutes, and had wet himself when it was all over.  His mood was wrecked for the day, and I lessened my demands on him for fear of having to put him through the timeout again, which was horrible for him.  He went home to his mother's house that night, and the next day when I saw him he soon began crying for no reason.  I put him in timeout and it did not last so long.  ""The wave is passing,"" I thought.  

Hard is it was for both of us, it was a battle of the wills that I needed to win, for his own sake.  ""Right now it is hard,"" I told myself, ""but that is what the battle of parenting is all about.  Good parenting is difficult to achieve precisely because of this difficulty--any parent can be soft and succumb to the will of their child in order to keep them happy in the moment.  This is the emotionally easy, lazy thing to do.  But the child will grow up without self-discipline (or good sleeping habits, or good eating habits, or good health) and live a miserable life as an adult.""  ""No,"" I said to myself, ""the good parent must sometimes harden one's heart against one's child for their own sake"" 

But when we went out that day he was still in a sad mood, and he still felt inclined to cry at the drop of a hat.  He was always difficult to get to sleep, but now it was incredibly difficult, which worsened both of our moods.  Moreover, he started behaving badly in new ways, refusing to wash his hands after using the bathroom, and starting to wet himself every time we went out.  My response was to be ever more firm, and to adopt an angry tone even when I did not feel angry, and give longer timeouts, in order that he would not perceive my weakening heart.

I started to become totally frayed.  I wanted to go back to how things were before, when we would go out and have fun, and he was generally in a good mood, and would, for the most part, behave well without being told to.  I woke up one morning and said to myself, ""I will bring the fun back, I will cook him french toast with as much syrup as he wants, then take him out to the park, and place no demands on him all day so that we can get the fun back.  Then the battle can continue.""

But he wanted the battle to continue immediately.  His french toast brought no joy and he threw it to the ground, refused to put on his shoes or even let me put on his shoes when it was time to go out, and began to cry and scream loudly in protest.  He used to *ask* for french toast and to go out, but now it was a battle to get him to do either.  So I put on my angry face as I knew I had to do, and put him in timeout alone in his room.  And he started to cry even louder.

And my heart broke.  All of my concerns about his discipline, and where we stood in the battle, melted away.  I simply decided that I wasn't going through it with him, so I let him out and gave him a hug.  I realized instinctively that I had introduced too much anger, frustration, and sadness into our relations.  At first this anger was just a ruse, a tool which I somehow thought necessary for him to believe that I meant what I said, but it had since become real and now it was a flame lit in both of us, and moreover it was a flame that I was trying to put out with *more* fire.  My heart told me, again only at an instinctive level, that I needed to put the fire out immediately on my end.

So I dropped it, I dropped the whole plan and left the battle entirely.  I decided that at all costs I would not show him any anger, and would quell it within myself as best I could.  As I held him and tried to console him my consolations did not work, he did not believe them and this upset me.  But I held back and let him down as he wanted.  I placed no demands on him and just let him do as he pleased.

But still the problem remained.  Still he was defiant and refused to do even the smallest thing.  So when he had gone to the bathroom and refused to wash his hands, I told him that he had to have a timeout in a simple, almost friendly tone.  And rather than pushing him into his room and closing the door, I sat him down on the bed, held him gently in place, and stared off into space.  I simply turned off all of my reactions.

And he screamed, and cried, and pleaded for timeout to end, and I sat with him quietly.  I let him get out all of his frustrations at me without even a hint of anger or frustration emanating from myself.  He could do as he pleased, the only rule was that he could not get up from timeout until timeout was over.  

When it ended I brought him back to the sink and asked him to wash his hands again.  Again he was defiant, and screamed ""NO"" at me.  I told him, again in a simple tone, that he can either wash his hands or have more timeout.  He chose more timeout and so we went again to timeout together.  This time he did not cry so much as scream at me in anger.  I sat quietly and allowed him his anger, and did not return it.  I saw it, rather, as my job to absorb his anger.  The only rule was that he had to sit in timeout until timeout was over.  But timeout had nothing to do with us.  Gradually it began to feel as though timeout came from somewhere else, from above maybe.

When timeout was over, he was calmer.  I asked him again to wash his hands, and this time (after a moment of thought), he decided to do it.  For the rest of the day I needed to use more timeouts to get him to do things.  But they were no longer painful.  For him they were simply a nuisance.  More importantly, they no longer represented a personal battle against me.  Timeout became, rather, a dull, empty event.  Reasoning, negotiation, and rage had no affect on timeout any more than they would have an effect on a stone.

The next day he needed only two timeouts.  The next two days, only one timeout apiece.  Day after that, no timeouts.  Meanwhile, the fun came back, because our battle was over.

**Moral:**  I introduced a needless element into my discipline, namely anger.  I did not see that it was unnecessary, and in fact harmful, because I had already framed discipline as a form of battle in my mind, which then made it a battle in reality.  It was not until my heart broke through to me that I was willing to lose the battle, at which point it ended.  But this moment of apparent defeat was actually the destruction of a superfluous and harmful construction of my own mind.  The collapse of this mental construction made the superfluousness and harmfulness of the anger it gave birth to immediately apparent to my heart, even though my mind could not rationalize it at the moment.  As a result, a more humane and effective form of discipline naturally arose, and my son and I reestablished our former state of harmony.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,False,,,True,t3_1i2k22,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1i2k22/a_concrete_example_of_the_usefulness_of_defeat/,

They moved out to California a few years ago.  Me, having graduated college a year ago and been unable to find relevant work, wanted to spend some quality time with them and save up money before going off on my own again.  I am doing this journey West solo, which was not my initial plan, but all the people I invited to tag along were busy.

I have been mostly camping out at free spots in order to save money.  One of the spots is in Cherokee National Forest in Eastern Tennessee.  I was doing a bit of walking along the creek before setting up my tent.  Although I didn't really feel lonely before, seeing car after car of 2+ groups of people drive by - to go swimming or fishing - made me feel like an outcast.  I've been having a great trip thus far, but this was my definitely a low point.
 
So I wander for an hour or so - my feet are starting to get sore, so I head back to my car to set up the tent.  On the way, I see a beautiful blue and black (spicebush swallowfly I believe) butterfly, zig-zagging around on the path.  I realize - the butterfly is a solitary creature, yet lives beautifully and with the Tao.  Also, the butterfly travels around rather chaotically - never on a linear way.  This observation was highly insightful, so I veer off the path a bit to write a poem about this.  

Afterwards, I get back on the path and continue heading back.  As I cross a small bridge over the creek, I see the same species of butterfly (perhaps the same one) fly up extremely close to me and circle around my head a few times, before flying off and disappearing behind the setting sun.  I am in disbelief, utterly stunned - I no longer feel alone or sad but incredibly tranquil and blissful.

I quickly realized that it was largely because I was travelling solo that I had seen the butterfly and had the insights.  Otherwise, my experience would have been totally different.

Approximately 30 seconds later, I see a bald eagle flying over the path, very low to the ground.  Although they aren't too rare in this area, I hardly ever see them - much less one so close up!  At this point, I start shedding tears of joy, really thinking I was in a dream or something (I was not... I think!).

I am still on my journey West, writing this at a McDonalds as my electronics charge.  While it has all been insightful, beautiful, and dynamic - the experience I mentioned seemed like a turning point or sorts.

Please do not bring them up in this survey's topic. We are collecting opinions on spirituality, not attempting to fire up yet another debate.

Please upvote this survey so that more data can be collected. This is a self post, so I'm not getting any karma. But we get the best results when many, many people take the survey.

Just thought I'd share and ask what you all feel about what I think.  

Ok so I have read the Tao of pooh, and am currently reading Tao Te Ching. Granted, there are many things I still do not grasp fully, but the main thing iv been thinking about is the Wu-Wei. At first glance, it sounds like it means don't do anything at all, and let what happens happen, in the way it wants to happen. That seems like a very un productive way to live. By productive I mean connected with anything. Essentially just laying in bed doing nothing. Then after applying to things such as playing an instrument it seemed like even less of a way of doing anything. No action means no learning and no progress. What's the point of even playing? Then after reading the second chapter of Tao Te Ching, it came to me. The sage acts with out expectations, and accomplishes without abiding in her accomplishments. Then with ""just being""ness of the uncarved block, the benefits of not desiring, and many other aspects, i achieved an idea and connection. If applied to an instrument or anything that requires practice, to effectively practice Wu-Wei, it would be simply play the instrument (or whatever your doing. Instrument is my main reference). Do not play to get better, do not play to impress, just simply play. I mean, still practice and do what you enjoy, but not have the mentality ""if I practice I WILL get better, I will improve"". When I ask my friends how they preform so well, they say ""I don't know I just play"" I finally made the connection, and it makes so much sense to me. So when doing anything in life, ideally the goal is to just do what you are trying to do.  
""just do"" sounds like doing something you don't enjoy, and I don't mean that intonation. Still enjoy what you do, don't be void of liveliness.  
  
This is just my thought process after a few days, I could be over thinking it, or completely wrong. But I thought I'd share my thoughts. Let me know what you think.

Conquer the mind, do non-doing.
In activity and quietude, know the source progenitor.
There is no thing; whom else do you seek?
Real constancy should respond to people;

When you don't get confused, your nature is naturally stable;
When your nature is stable, energy naturally returns.
When energy returns, Elixir spontaneously crystallizes,
In the pot pairing water and fire.
Yin and yang arise, alternating over and over again,
Everywhere producing the sound of thunder.
White clouds assemble on the summit,
Sweet dew bathes the polar mountain.
Having drunk the wine of longevity,
You wander free; who can know you?
You sit and listen to the stringless tune,
You clearly understand the mechanism of creation.
The whole of these twenty verses
is a ladder straight to heaven.”

He admired most of the teachings of Dogen, the 13th century monk who first brought Soto Zen to Japan. He was also drawn to the unconventional life and poetry of the Zen mountain poet Han-shan, who lived in China sometime during the T’ang Dynasty (618 to 907). He repeatedly refused to be honored or confined as a 'professional,' either as a Buddhist priest or as a poet. 

&gt;He wrote:
&gt;
&gt;Who says my poems are poems?

&gt;These poems are not poems.

&gt;When you can understand this,
    
&gt;then we can begin to speak of poetry.
&gt;
&gt;Ryokan never published a collection of verse while he was alive. His practice consisted of sitting in zazen meditation, walking in the woods, playing with children, making his daily begging rounds, reading and writing poetry, doing calligraphy, and on occasion drinking wine with friends.
&gt;
&gt;Ryokan later dubbed himself Taigu, or 'Great Fool,' but this title had a special meaning. A Zen master who taught the young Ryokan described him this way: 'Ryokan looks like a fool, but his way of life is an entirely emancipated one. He lives on playing, so to say, with his destiny, liberating himself from every kind of fetter.' He went on to describe his disciple’s simple life: 'In the morning he wanders out of his hut and goes God knows where and in the evening loiters around somewhere. For fame he cares nothing. Men’s cunning ways he puts out of the question.'

**In My Youth I Put Aside My Studies**

    In my youth I put aside my studies 
    And I aspired to be a saint. 
    Living austerely as a mendicant monk, 
    I wandered here and there for many springs. 
    Finally I returned home to settle under a craggy peak. 
    I live peacefully in a grass hut, 
    Listening to the birds for music. 
    Clouds are my best neighbors. 
    Below a pure spring where I refresh body and mind; 
    Above, towering pines and oaks that provide shade and brushwood. 
    Free, so free, day after day -- 
    I never want to leave! 


***


**No Mind**

    With no mind, flowers lure the
    butterfly;
    With no mind, the butterfly visits
    the blossoms.
    Yet when flowers bloom, the butterfly
    comes;
    When the butterfly comes, the
    flowers bloom. 


***

**Midsummer**

    Midsummer -- 
    I walk about with my staff. 
    Old farmers spot me 
    And call me over for a drink. 
    We sit in the fields 
    using leaves for plates. 
    Pleasantly drunk and so happy 
    I drift off peacefully 
    Sprawled out on a paddy bank. 



***


**At Dusk**


    at dusk
    i often climb
    to the peak of kugami.
    deer bellow,
    their voices
    soaked up by
    piles of maple leaves
    lying undisturbed at
    the foot of the mountain. 


***



**Like the Little Stream**

    Like the little stream 
    Making its way 
    Through the mossy crevices 
    I, too, quietly 
    Turn clear and transparent. 



***

**Yes, I'm Truly a Dunce**

    Yes, I’m truly a dunce
    Living among trees and plants.
    Please don’t question me about illusion and enlightenment --
    This old fellow just likes to smile to himself.
    I wade across streams with bony legs,
    And carry a bag about in fine spring weather.
    That’s my life,
    And the world owes me nothing.

When the world ignores Dao war horses are pastured on the public common. 


There is no sin greater than desire. There is no misfortune greater than discontent. There is no calamity greater than acquisitiveness. 


Therefore to know extreme contentment is simply to be content. 




Interpretation:

It is sometimes surprising how many people have never examined what and why they desire.  For example, there are very many people in the world who, when you greet them, will immediately and consistently tell you what is wrong, with them, with the weather, with the world.   Since they tend to always respond this way, they must have some desire.  They must be seeking some gratification.  But what?  And why?

This chapter is perhaps the most accessible to the western mind.  It begins with an observation of social behavior and then personalizes it.

The first stanza observes that horses can serve prosperous ends when Dao is followed but destructive ends when it is not.  

The second stanza states clearly that it is desire, (and the Buddha might add, ""the inability to acquire what we desire) that keeps us discontent.

The third stanza might be interpreted as ""contentment comes from being happy for no reason.  always we want things, the weekend, the new TV, the better job.   How do we feel when we are experiencing a simple pleasure?   petting the dog?  Combing long hair slowly?   Is it possible to feel content simply for the sake of feeling content without any stimuli?

1333979363.0,30,self.taoism,s0rgw,I think Herman Hesse’s masterpiece “Siddhartha” is a book about the Tao.,Wolvenfire86,32,2,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/s0rgw/i_think_herman_hesses_masterpiece_siddhartha_is_a/,"I just finished reading the masterpiece Siddhartha yesterday and I felt such a connection to the main character, partly because his own spiritual quest reminds me of my own in some places, partly because his beliefs matched Taoist beliefs too.

When Siddhartha meets the Buddha, he listens to the beliefs but cannot accept them. Buddha’s teachings are “right”, they make sense, Buddha was a great man and his followers are good people, but Siddhartha could not accept the teachings because something was just wrong with the idea of using words to teach, having someone share wisdom when wisdom cannot be shared directly. I felt this same way when studying the major religions of the world. Had I not encountered Buddhism, my discontent with some of its beliefs never would have led me to the Tao (in this book, they say Atman).

When Siddhartha goes to a river and becomes a ferryman’s assistance, he learns from water. He learns to listen. He learns to think through nature. He learns so many extraordinary things from an old ferryman who barely spoke. He learned that time does not exist, that there is a “music to nature” and the river has many voices. These are themes I have heard from the poems Huang Zi.

The final chapter is extraordinary. Siddhartha says that wisdom cannot be shared through words, knowledge can be shared through qwords but not wisdom. He says that all things are beautiful because they exist now and not for what they “might become”, Siddhartha says he wants to love the earth only as it is, picks up a stone and remarks on its beauty (the uncarved block). “The world is never incomplete or on its path to completeness. It is complete at every moment.” His old friend who hears these words does not understand them, thinks they are strange, and Taoists know exactly why that is.

I have high respect for Buddhism and Buddhist, but it is not for me. It doesn’t make me feel as…whole as Taoism. Perhaps it is the striking similarities like these that is why Taoists and Buddhists get along so well.

For example, when one listens to a good piece of music, one does not merely hear a sequence of sounds.  Rather, the bare content of what is heard resonates in the soul and gives rise to something entirely new.  

Some people say it is simply emotion--happiness, sadness, what have you.  But this does not quite fit.  Songs like Beethoven's *Moonlight Sonata*, or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGxNnnXTvKs) radiohead song, seem to do more than merely provoke a raw emotion.  It is more like they directly communicate some deep aspect of reality, something which cannot be expressed in words or understood in any other way.  

Another way to describe it is that it gives birth to something new inside of you which soaks deep in little rivulets as the song progresses, lighting you up with emotion as they pass through.  Sometimes these rivulets touch some part of you that you have long forgotten, or never knew existed, and bring it to life.

But it is not only music which brings about such unspeakable experiences.  Both commonplace experiences like a quiet moment of eye contact with your child, and rare experiences like the death of a friend, communicate something beyond words or bare sensory information.  They have a musical effect all their own.  In fact, music is actually just an imitation of what these moments produce.  Happy or sad, good or evil, one should probably try to listen closely.

Many people, including myself, have often searched for the ""meaning of life.""  I am beginning to think, however, that this is something which cannot be learned from philosophy or religion.  It is, perhaps, truly without words, but not inaccessible.  Rather, it is something we come to understand over time, bit by bit, as we listen to our experiences.  And death teaches the final lesson.  Perhaps it feels something like spinning plates.

This page and a h'alf of text was from the section""Where I Lived, and What I Lived For"". A great read for anyone interested in a 19th century perspective of an emerging globalized world.

Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths. while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worth things have any permanent and absolute existence,-that petty fears and petty pleasure are but the shadow of reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think that they are wiser bu experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo book, that ""there was a kind's son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his father's ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,"" continues the Hindoo philosopher, ""from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows itself to be Brahme."" I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think you, would the ""Milldam"" go to? If he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail, or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and the would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Le us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it. 

I encourage everyone to read this book. I think these communities will fall in love with its philosophy and style. Not so much for the types of words, but because this seems to be one of the last, untainted views of the natural world before the industrial revolution culminates in the the fast-paced world we live now.

As bold as it is, I pondered a ""second meaning"" to the very first lines

&gt;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao

My thoughts:

Yes, this is the de-facto original statement that the Tao is ineffable and incomprehensible. But, consider this. The Tao that can be *told.* Followed by, of course

&gt;The name that can be named is not the true name

Would it be incorrect to assume that these lines, while expressing the ineffability of such concepts, also is a renouncement of any real form of ""preaching""? When I read the first line, I feel as if it's saying, in layman's terms, ""No-one can really tell you what the Tao is. And if they try to tell you otherwise, then they're not talking about the real Tao. Ergo, it's not that you'll never know what it is. It's that you have to figure it out for yourself.""

Second thought:

I recently had a chat with my English teacher after finding out that he's read the Tao Classics. He told me that he thought, in his interpretation, that Taoism ""wasn't very intellectual"". He was referring to Chapter 19

&gt;End sagacity; abandon knowledge; The people benefit a hundred times

My thoughts: When I read that, I see it not as abandonment of knowledge and discovery in terms of intelligence or intellectualism. Rather, I see it as the abandonment of formalized, organized scholar systems. To end sagacity is to end the categorization, classification, and subsequent division of knowledge. In ending sagacity and abandoning ""knowledge"", all true wisdom and discovery can become apparent to everyone from the distinguished noble to even the common peasant.

""Converting to Taosim"" sounds cool but at the same time, it's more of just a life philosophy  than a belief in Immortals and such. A contemporary western view I suppose. 

I love the ideas behind the Tao though, and I guess any way of life can be considered a religion in some way. 

Anyway, I've always heard people say to just do something new without being afraid of being uncomfortable, and also to stay positive. But something about reading up on Taoism really clicked with me. Letting negative people and situations affect me in a positive way, opening my mind to new things. Suppressing desire has actually been quite effective as well (instead of 'wanting' to lose weight, just get on the treadmill and do it. This skips the bad emotions that comes with desire/lust, at least it does for me).

One example of how Taoism has changed me: Yesterday I went to a place called ""Grant's Farm"". It is Ulysses S. Grant's private farm, which is basically a small zoo. I'd been there many times before, but this time was different.  Things that normally annoyed me seemed to please me.  The hot weather reminded me that all the trees were green and beautiful.  The smell of animal shit reminded me there is life all around, incredible exotic life I'd never see in my back yard.  The pleasure of sitting in a chair and just *absorbing* the atmosphere of a restaurant. It was a great experience and I felt ""at peace"" and that nothing could truly bother me.

One quirk I have is that, usually whenever I go to social events, I get terribly, terribly nervous beforehand.  This has happened to me for that last 4 years for no discernible reason. This morning, on facebook I saw that my ex was attending a grad party that I also planned on attending. My stomach dropped out from under me and I just sat there saying ""No, no. . . ."" Then I sat up, said ""chill the fuck out bro. Think of the Tao."" And before my rational mind even began processing exactly what I meant by that, I was already calm and no longer nervous.  So what if she is there?  There's no point resisting. I'll see her and nothing bad will happen.  She won't make me feel terrible because *I'm over her*.  Tons of my friends will be there and interacting with her will most likely be short and for the most part sweet.  If not, it's another life experience I can take with me. 

Questions/comments are welcome.

P.S. I probably won't get into any kind of meditation techniques, alchemy, etc. but the idea of being a Taoist is very interesting to me. It's like a religion but with nothing to fight for, a true religion of peace. That sounds wonderful to me.  

P.P.S. I purchased ""The Tao of Pooh"" and eagerly await its delivery.

Now, I was reading Tao Te Ching today and it's interesting and I've always been interested in asian culture and art and mysticism.  Anyways I get the stuff about embracing the subtle and appreciating the simplicity of nothing.  Some of the verses though seemed like they were just written to appease workers.  Instead of having a large base of your population angry and rioting about wages and work conditions, it seems much more pleasant to have them all be docile and accepting of slum conditions.  It seems that it goes beyond ""be thankful for what you have"" to ""If you had more, things would be bad.  Have less, in fact strive to have nothing."" 

When I think of Taoism generally, I think of modesty, nature, meditation... The idea of nothing is an interesting concept when taken out of society, and I don't just mean western society.  The idea of living in harmony with nature, taking from the earth that which you need and observing beauty might just be the epitome of Taoism.  But from what I've read so far, Tao Te Ching discusses kings, society, work.  In my mind, from what I believed about Taoism previously, it's not contradictory for a man to take pride in his work, and to strive for modesty.  If empty-mindedness means truly to have no responsibilities and no desires, then what does a man live for?  Why doesn't a Taoist simply end his life to achieve true harmony with the earth?",,False,,t5_2qhmd,False,,,True,t3_10qp9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/10qp9c/elements_of_brainwashing/,

'You are now advanced in years. Is there any member of your family whom I could employ to look for horses in your stead?' 

Po Lo replied: 'A good horse can be picked out by its general build and appearance. But the superlative horse--one that raises no dust and leaves no tracks--is something evanescent and fleeting, elusive as thin air. The talent of my sons lies on a lower plane altogether: they can tell a good horse when they see one, but they cannot tell a superlative horse. I have a friend, however, one Chiu-fang Kao, a hawker of fuel and vegetables, who in things appertaining to horses is nowise my inferior. Pray see him.'

Duke Mu did so, and subsequently despatched him on the quest for a steed. 

Three months later, he returned with the news that he had found one. 'It is now in Sha-ch'iu,' he added. 'What kind of a horse is it?' asked the Duke. 'Oh, it is a dun-coloured mare,' was the reply. However, on some one being sent to fetch it, the animal turned out to be a coal-black stallion! 

Much displeased, the Duke sent for Po Lo. 'That friend of yours,' he said, 'whom I commissioned to look for a horse, has made a nice mess of it. Why, he cannot even distinguish a beast's colour or sex! What on earth can he know about horses?' 

Po Lo heaved a sigh of satisfaction. 'Has he really got as far as that?' he cried. 'Ah, then he is worth a thousand of me put together. There is no comparison between us. What Kao keeps in view is the spiritual mechanism. In making sure of the essential, he forgets the homely details; intent on the inward qualities, he loses sight of the external. He sees what he wants to see, and not what he does not want to see. He looks at the things he ought to look at, and neglects those that need not be looked at. So clever a judge of horses is Kao, that he has it in him to judge something better than horses.'

When the horse arrived, it turned out indeed to be a superlative horse.

1344104013.0,23,self.taoism,xoge9,I've noticed a lot of people seeking a discussion on Christianity and how it relates to Taoism.,TheReggular,27,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/xoge9/ive_noticed_a_lot_of_people_seeking_a_discussion/,"The consensus seems to be that Christianity and Taoism are compatible. Some people have said that reading Taoist texts and inserting Christian terms elicits more or less the same teachings as the Bible. Some people are even going so far as to say that Christianity and Taoism are basically the same thing.

I think there is a very important, fundamental difference between the two.

Certain churches within Christianity teach of ""total depravity,"" a consequence of ""original sin"" that basically tells us that every individual is born as a slave in the service of sin. Man is ""fallen,"" meaning that we are not capable of doing real good--even the bit of us that intends to do good is only self-service in disguise. Not only that, but in your natural state you aren't even able to see or appreciate the nature of God and his goodness (which you could equate ""the Tao""). Only through great effort and renouncement of your old, flawed self can you even get an idea about the good that exists in the realm of God, which is separate from ours. Christianity draws a very clear line between the true, real good that God does and the futile attempts at virtue that are the best efforts of man. (The specifics of this are as many as there are churches within the Christian faith, and the conversations are ongoing.)

Taoism shows the individual as having a totally different relationship to the world, the universe, and the way it works (which you could equate to ""God""). You are a piece of everything that is in the world--good and bad. You are connected, always a participator in all things from the lowest levels of complexity to the very highest. But more importantly, it requires no great effort on your part to know and feel that this is true. In fact, the more you try to see it, the harder it is to see.

I enjoy conversations about Taoism with my Christian friends, and this is always the impasse that we reach-- it's a question of what you believe about human nature.

EDIT: fixed typo, TL;DR: Christianity says that mankind is fundamentally flawed and effort fixes you. Taoism says that mankind is fundamentally unflawed and effort ruins you.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,1344186536.0,,,True,t3_xoge9,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/xoge9/ive_noticed_a_lot_of_people_seeking_a_discussion/,

For 10 years I've thought of myself as Taoist but disagree with them on some points. Also, over ten years of Taoist study, meditation, Chi Kung, and Kung Fu I still feel like it is missing something. What I cannot say. Buddhism is very intriguing to me as I recently found out they generally do not believe in Gods (a hang up for me with Taoism that has often resulted in me saying I am a 'philosophical Taoist'). I also like how they seem to feel regarding the pursuit of happiness. Their appreciation for science is also refreshing. I would like to ask the communities were my beliefs most closely align. Can one be a Taoist and Buddhist? Are there any large differences between the two? Are these labels meaningless anyway? These are my personal beliefs: I do not believe in God, Heaven, or Hell. I have never seen a good justification for the belief in reincarnation neither. The writings of Lao Tzu are some of may favorite things in the world and while just starting to more thoroughly read the teaching of the Buddha, they are great as well. I believe what each author is saying ~99% of the time. Chi Kung and meditation produce results that I can feel. I believe strongly in science though and hate it when the religious hold on to ancient thoughts regardless of how disproven by science. I believe in questioning absolutes. I believe while on earth we should pursue happiness and we should be helpful to others. I do both of these thing already. But am curious which belief describe me? Or does it not matter?

1368817239.0,22,self.taoism,1ej8fg,Pretty alarming concerns over a teacher I have trusted for almost a year,taoaway,23,1,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1ej8fg/pretty_alarming_concerns_over_a_teacher_i_have/,"So, I'm not going to mention any names, but I've been studying ""marital arts"" and whatnot from a taoist priest. He comes from a very bonafide lineage and, without being too specific, he is as qualified to teach as anyone else could be. He is from a monastery in China and has been teaching for over 20 years.

Anyways, I've been studying under this person, informally, for 8 months. In the course of these 8 months I've learned all sorts awesome qi gong and tai ji, taoist concepts and even some taoist medicine. However I've started to notice certain things that don't quite line up with the teachings on kindness, mercy and forgiveness that drew me to taoism in the first place. 

1. His harsh methods. Ordinarily in everyday interaction, aside for his appearance as a robed priest, he is humorous, kind and gracious. However he is quite harsh to students that are closer to him. I have seen him publicly shame his top disciple/teacher for inconsequential occurrences such as forgetting to open the flu for the fireplace in the room we train in. The feeling of overwhelming shame that washed over her in that moment left me feeling very uncomfortable, and I was so sorry for that poor student in that moment. As well, he has singled out another close student of his and called his tai ji ugly multiple times in the same training session. After that session I approached him and asked him about the ordeal. He said that our teacher was being so hard on him because he is the worst in the class and needs to improve. He saw it as a good thing. I tried to remember believing that I was the ""worst"" at something, like when I was a child learning something, and the feeligns I managed to invoke were not health-promoting. The way I see it for myself, and this is my own opinion and nothing more, is that this student is taking on an identity given to him by this teacher as someone who sucks. I  can see it in the way he walks, in his interactions with myself and others, and it's not the attitude I want to cultivate for myself. 

Keep in mind as the class started our teacher made a comment about how he can see our whole lives through our tai ji, through the way we do it and whatnot. So the implication is that our teacher can call the way this guy runs his own life ugly and publicly shame him for it. I'm aware that in warrior traditions this harshness is necessary for creating people that will fight, maim and even kill others. However we are studying tai ji for health. Even in his lectures he justifies his own behavior with references to how a father beats his children out of love. My father beat the shit out of me, and I know it wasn't out of love. When he picked me up from soccer, when he fed me, when he provided warmth and safety for me, that was out of love. His beatings were out of frustration and anger, out of liver qi with no root due to his alcoholism. This supposed priest is justifying abuse and it makes me uncomfortable.

2. He is preferential to the women that visit our class, and the more attractive they are the more hands-on attention they get with instruction. I can't put my finger on it, but it seems slightly predatory when I combine this observation with his habit of talking to the attractive girls outside of class much more than any of the men or the older woman (not to put you beautiful women down!). Also, without getting into specifics, I recently learned some things about his personal life that seem to match up with facilitating these behaviors.

3. He is asking for money to fund a very expensive project worth millions of dollars while he himself lives in, to put it mildly, a very nice mansion. I just learned this recently as well, sparking this dilemma inside myself. I feel weird donating money to someone who clearly doesnt need it. He owns so much property, so many overseas business worth millions of dollars, etc., it makes me wonder why I would ever not give money to someone on the side of the road begging for change if I have money to spare for this guy. He clearly does not need it but he is soliciting funds for this project. It just smacks of all the other spiritual gurus out there that preach charity and simplicity yet lead lavish lives for themselves and don't give as much as they could or encourage others to. 

I don't know what to do. Am I overinflating these concerns? I don't even want to begin to confront him on this stuff. I would prefer to do nothing other than withdraw and give no explanation. I just need to hear someone else' thoughts.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who put some thought into my question.

In a way, I feel this clashes with the non-striving, non-willing (or -wanting) aspect of Tao. As such, there is conflict, and I don't know how to respond.

I was meditating a few nights ago. My personal form of meditation is an odd sort of blend of mindfulness meditation (to promote calm and tranquility) as well as psychonautic (receiving visions or experiences through exploration of my own psyche). I have had a number of experiences through meditation that qualify as any and all of the following:

* Out of Body Experience
* Wake-Induced Lucid Dreaming
* Astral Projection
* Spiritual Journey

With this backstory out of the way, I'd simply like to tell you all of this one particular experience. As I sat completely still on the floor, eyes closed, mind gently calming, I realized that my tactile sensations were subtly fading. It felt as though my arms and legs were going numb, but similarly, it felt as if they were being encompassed by something. I became aware of what exactly was ""around"" me. Every molecule of air brushing against my skin, I discovered, was inherently no different in shape or size than the molecules present in my cells. It was as if my physical body was leaving my mind behind, going off to mingle with other physical things like itself. Afterwards, with some of my body still relatively sensitive, I felt a sort of energy around my head. It was as if one were watching honey drip out of a bottle, against gravity. Something soft, warm and tender felt as though it were ascending out of my head in thick strands and drops, not unlike the Taoist ""Spiritual Cosmonaut"" idea of a spirit leaving its body to explore outside its vessel.

After some time, as all meditation is, the feelings faded, and I stood, stretched, and went to bed. I simply wanted to share all this to see if any fellow Taoists have had a similar experience, or could provide some sort of alternative perspective / additional knowledge of what I went through myself.

Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.
You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

I've fashioned a loose rendering of it for your perusal, let me know what you think.  

&gt;When the Buddha sees a rose, does he recognize it as a rose in the same way that we do?  Of course he does.  But before he says that a rose is a rose, the Buddha has seen that it is also not a rose.  He has seen that it is made up of non-rose elements, with no clear line of demarcation between the rose and those elements that are not the rose.  
When we perceive things, we generally separate what we perceive as reality into seperate pieces saying ""This piece is A and cannot be B, C, or D.""  But when ""A"" is looked at in light of ""co-dependent arising"", we see that ""A"" is comprised of B,C,D, and everything else in the Universe; ""A"" can never exist by itself alone.  
This is the way the Buddha looks at a rose, and it is why he is not attached to the rose.  This is also the basis for the well known Zen koan:  ""Before practicing Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers.  While practicing Zen, mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers. After practicing Zen, mountains are mountains again, and rivers are rivers again.""  The Tao is the true nature of wisdom, love, and happiness.  Only when we can recognize the signless nature of signs do we have a chance of perceiving the Tao.  When we look at a rose without being caught up in its signs, we can see the nature of non-rose; and therefore we begin to perceive the Tao in the rose.  If we look into a pebble, a tree, or even a child in this manner, we can see the Tao in them as well.

It was a fun exercise and made me consider how many possible ways the Chinese language could be taken. Especially as sparsely written as the Tao to Ching is, it is closer to poetry.

I appreciate that life is going to be the way that it's going to be and I simply can't deal with the rocks it casts in my river with maxims, dogma or doctrine and instead like to deal with them according to what they are lest I crash into them.

At the same time, I love Ayn Rand. A couple years ago I read ""The Fountainhead"" and am going to read it again very soon. I understand that Rand isn't the most popular person in the world and I don't agree with quite a few of her ""I hate poor people"" philosophies, but I adore I views on the self. I love her ideals as applied to liberty and (to a point) the philosophies of rational egoism.

I view myself as a meritocrat (albeit a horribly bad one) and, while I see how my belief in both Taoism and hierarchical meritocracy with rational egoism can blend, I'm not sure it's right.

Taoism is quite the opposite!

Individualists believe in exerting their will upon the world. How does this compare with Taoist words?

""He allows things to come and go.""

Taoism repeatedly states very non-individualistic concepts:

""Can you love people and lead them
without imposing your will?
Can you deal with the most vital matters
by letting events take their course?""

From Wikipedia:
Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology, or social outlook that emphasizes ""the moral worth of the individual"". Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by society or institutions such as the government.

While certainly, I believe most Taoists are critical, independent thinkers, there is confusion to equate that with individualism. While an individualist would promote their ideas, morals and goals upon the external world, the Taoist would not interfere, would let the world be what it is.

The evidence seems to be stacked against that, and yet some people persist in what appears to be a delusion.  In fact, if this is taken into consideration, does the word annihilation even have anything it can be applied to?  The word is useless in any kind of literal sense.

Some look fierce, but are mild.
Some seem timid, but are vicious.
Look beyond appearances;
position yourself for the advantage.

***

Without experience, it is easy to be fooled by appearances. A large man speaks loudly, so we instantly judge him crass or belligerent. He may later turn out to be quite kind and generous. If we approach him too defensively, we may never see these positive traits. On the other hand, when we notice a petite, quiet woman in our midst, we may allow our guard to fall, becoming complacent. If she turns out to be a treacherous person, our laxity contributed to our victimization.

Sometimes people are exactly as they appear. Other times, they are merely using camouflage. ~Deng

Humans, like animals, use different strategies for survival. Coloring, movement, scent, and sound are all used in the animal kingdom as means of deception, to draw prey in or to frighten predators away. Humans are no different. A man may promise a great many things and never come through. A woman may proclaim lifelong love and affection while sleeping around. Even if this man or woman disappears from your life, never to return, you will not be without their presence. The wounds caused from misplaced trust are often the hardest to heal.

Learn to discern the personalities of others from the facades which they project. See beyond the mask they wear.

Now some people may say that it actually goes against Taoist saying that chess all about fighting and controlling the board, while Taoist say its better to let go and find harmony, I will attempt to dispute this in this following wall of text.

The first thing you need to do to be able to see my view is look at the opposing sides of pieces (black &amp; white) as yin and yang. Now, if you've ever played chess before you know that there is no such thing as the perfect defense, so you know that wherever there is a high accumulation of white pieces, most likely a black piece will find it's way there and a battle would ensue. 

This leads into my next idea, that every move is a strategic yielding of yin to yang, or vice versa. Now, when I say strategic, I'm saying strategy in a way following a certain harmony with the goal of overcoming the other. I believe that yin and yang are constantly in conflict with each other, rather than gently gliding by each other in easy harmony, but still I see these as the same, in a way. Like if you were looking at a volcano eruption from a spaceship far away, the volcano lava would look perfectly harmonious with the shape of the earth, wouldn't it? But of course we know that's not true, volcanoes destroy trees and eat up land. So fighting and harmony are the same. And wherever there is yin present there is the yang principle also, and if that's true, then even if the yang principle is destroyed then it will just arise in different form. An easy way to think about this is if you have a class full of women (yin), and only a few men (yang). Eventually, the yang principle will try to balance, either by the men acting manlier or the women developing manly qualities to compensate.

This is why I don't try cultivate non-thinking (although I find meditation good for other reasons), because within every thought, every idea, non-thinking is present. Think about the action of kicking a ball, you think ""To kick the ball I first have to get my foot under the ball"". But what's really going on behind the idea ""get under the ball""? A crazy amount factors unfactorable! Un-thinkable thoughts. See what I'm getting at? And if you try to think about those un-thinkable thoughts, like how does one get under the ball? You might come up with answers like ""by moving the foot forward"" or ""by just kicking it"", but how does one move the foot forward? How does one just kick? That could go on to infinity, infinitely rejuvenating the yang principle.

So you see, you can't really let go fighting and struggling, that would be denying reality. And there is no real way to let go of harmony either, because fighting is harmony close up.

Also I thought this was interesting:

pond-moves 1 space vertical (barely any action)

knight-L shaped movement (more action than the pond) 

bishop-full diagonal movement (more than knight or pond)

rook-full horizontal movement (same as bishop)

Queen-full horizontal and diagonal (greater than knight and bishop)

King Wen's statement is among the most beautiful passages of the text. Wilhelm/Baynes translate it:

&gt;THE WELL. The town may be changed,

&gt;	But the well cannot be changed.

&gt;	It neither decreases nor increases.

&gt;	They come and go and draw from the well.

&gt;	If one gets down almost to the water

&gt;	And the rope does not go all the way,

&gt;	Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.

I feel like this passage taps into the very core of Taoism. Everything which becomes of it (the town) may flux, but the Tao is constant. The Tao never increases or decreases, which is reiterated many times in the Tao Te Ching. Many people come and go and draw from the Tao, but as we see, not everybody, for some people get almost down to the purest source, their rope does not extend, and even their jug may break.

Now the latter part is especially interesting, because it introduces a lot of symbols into this picture: the rope and the jug. One of my questions is, if this passage is truly indicative of the Tao, which I believe it is (but feel free to argue with that concept), what do these symbols represent? Especially in reference to the Tao Te Ching, which followed it, and was highly influenced by the I Ching.

All in the world recognize the beautiful as beautiful.  
herein lies ugliness.  
All recognize the good as good.

Therefore  
being and non-being produce each other.  
Difficulty and ease bring about each other.  
Long and short delimit each other.  
High and low rest on each other.  
sound and voice harmonize each other.  
Front and back follow each other.  
  
  
Therefore the sage abides in the condition of wu-wei

John farmer sat at his door one September evening, after a hard day's work, his mind still running on his labor more or less. Having bathed he sat down to recreate his intellectual man. It was a rather cool evening, and some of his neighbors were apprehending a frost. He had not attended to the train of his thoughts long when he heard some one paying on a flute, and that sound harmonized with his mood. Still he thought of his work; but the burden of this thought was, that though this kept running in his head, and he found himself planning and contriving it against his will, yet it concerned him very little. It was no more than the scurf of his skin, which was constantly shuffled off. But the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for a certain faculties which slumbered in him. They gently did away with the street, and the village, and the state in which he lived. A voice said to him, -Why do you stay here and live this mean moiling life, when a glorious existence is possible for you? Those same stars twinkle over other fields than these. -But how to come out of this condition and actually migrate thither? All that he could think of was to practise new austerity, to let his mind descend into his body and redeem it, and treat himself with ever increasing respect.

First, I would like to make the case that this is spam (to those who don't believe it is). Second, I would like to make sure people would be fine with getting rid of it. 

I messaged the moderators about this guy, I got a pm back from sunny_mcjoyride basically saying that since some of his posts were upvoted (it is actually only one) he is fine. I don't think he is fine. Here is why:

* He has posted 14 times to /r/taoism in the last [28 days](http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/search?q=site%3Awp.me&amp;restrict_sr=on) (link to search of wp.me in this sub). Only one of these has a score above 2, while most are at zero.

* I have only downvoted 9 of the posts in that search and he is at -18 according to my RES history. That means there are at least 9 posts in addition to the 14 that show up. (Now I believe these have been deleted when they score too low, or sometimes reposted as shown below.)

* It is a spam account that, at least 90% of the time, only posts links to his blog. When he does comment it does not contribute to any sort of discussion, it is just to note what is on his blog.

* The fact that one of their posts has been upvoted is not a justification for allowing it. If you post every other day, some of your content will get upvoted, that is just how reddit works (and I imagine many people will upvote anything they see in a niche subreddit like [/r/taoism](/r/taoism) ). It is not a sign that the person is contributing anything of value. They are at a net loss in contribution (many zero posts).

* This subreddit does not have much content. So that even his downvoted posts stick around for a long time. Since he posts a lot of low scoring content, he is polluting the subreddit.

[Item Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/qdskf/the_taoist_sage_a_spiritual_portrait_10th_chapter/)

Item one was posted earlier. It is a link to an article on that guy's blog. It got downvoted. It is now deleted and reposted as item two. If anything confirms the uselessness of this guy, it is the deletion and reposting.

The spammer in question has been reported to [/r/reportthespammers](/r/reportthespammers) 4 times (only once by me).

Personally, I am sick of this blog spam. I am a little annoyed that the mods aren't addressing it, but I guess they are entitled to their opinion. Can we call for stricter moderation on non-contributing accounts? Should I just unsubscribe and call it a day? How do you guys feel about his posts?

* ""It seems rather odd, somehow, that Taoism, the way of the Whole Man, True Man, Spirit Man (to use a few Taoist terms) is for the most part interpreted here in the West by the Scholarly Owl --by the Brain, by the Academician, the dry-as-dust Absentminded Professor.""

* (immediately following) ""this incomplete and unbalanced creature divides all kinds of abstract things into little categories and compartments, while remaining rather helpless and disorganized in his daily life.""

There is no notion of the book being controversial on its Wikipedia page. I'm rather curious -- how much of the Taoist community would identify with such remarks about scholars and academics? Is it really the wrong way of life, as the book seems to suggest?

I don't think that I did anything particularly condescending, but that's completely a matter of perspective. I'm used to being surrounded with people who appreciate my absolute honesty. If I say something to offend them, they will tell me immediately. She's not like that, and I'm finding it difficult to adjust.

I want her to be happy with her decisions and not care if I disagree with them. Not that I want her to ignore my thoughts on the matter, just like I don't want to ignore hers, but more that if we disagree I want that to be ok with her. As I'm typing this, I realize that I'm not sure what she wants, which explains why I feel a bit lost.

I recognize a great opportunity here: I will become more able to tell someone how I feel about something in a way that does not make them feel chastised or belittled. But I'm finding the road difficult.

Advice? Passages or thoughts or ramblings or really anything would be appreciated. :)

When I start eating real food, I'll be mostly eating things like lots of salads, fish, almonds, cooked (not raw) vegetables which on all accounts looks like the paleo diet. I would like to have some sort of carb like brown rice or quinoa but there seems to be two schools. One school is okay with certain grains like brown rice and quinoa which is better for the body than say pasta if you want carbs. The other school is 辟穀 or Bigu (grain avoidance), which is referenced in multiple places in taoist literature, referring to the grain as something that creates ""body humors"". This makes sense as we see folks having to eliminate gluten. The extra acid and yeast being the precursors to some cancers. 

The Bigu method seems to be limited to fasts while others stick to it whole heartedly. You see this in many Asian cultures as the evidence of obsesity is quite low, compared to Western dietary choices. Its not uncommon to see warm greens next to a bowl of sweet congee for breakfast. This fact is changing with the increase of the middle class in China, clamoring for unhealthy American tastes.

I was wondering if anyone had any thought about a synthesis of Virtue Theory and Taoism.

So just a little background information on Virtue Theories. Virtue Theories are much more focused on the character of the moral agent than with the particular action (Deontology) or with its outcomes (Utilitarian). The primary question in response to a situation is something like ""How can I use this situation to be kind, charitable, empathetic, [list of virtues]?"". Some examples of Virtue Theories are Aristotelian Ethics developed by Aristotle (~350 BCE) and Confucianism developed by Confucius (~500 BCE). Exactly which virtues or character traits ought to be sought after depends on which theory is being used. The Ancient Greeks and Chinese, for example, would praise different virtues. And the virtues can also be different for different types of people within one ethical framework. For instance Confucianism tends to focus on questions like ""What would a virtuous mother/father/child do in this situation?"" as opposed to ""What would a virtuous person do in this situation?"". For this reason Confucianism is sometimes called a Role Ethic instead of a Virtue Ethic.

Now I am mostly just looking for a compare and contrast of general virtue theories and Taoism. I have long been an appreciator of Taoism and last year I had a course on Ethics which discussed Deontology, Utilitarianism and Aristotelian Ethics. Of these three I found myself most inclined towards the Virtue Theory. What I liked about it was its focus on character and not specifically the virtues that Aristotle lists. I felt that some type of virtue theory could be reconciled with my already present Taoist leanings.  Then just recently I began to look into Confucianism and was surprised to find that it can be classified as a type of virtue theory. And the general impression that I had gotten from the Taoist communities that I am engaged in is that Confucianism and Taoism have some severe differences.

So if looked at naively this seems like a separation within myself into an appreciator of virtue theories and an appreciator of Taoism. So against this idea I would like to seek out a synthesis (as much as possible) of a general virtue theory framework and Taoism. Most of this synthesis will happen within myself but I think that hearing your ideas would be helpful.

Thanks for your time.

Hey, I just recently started getting into Taoism and I have a question.

For example, a while ago I broke my wrist. While I was recovering it was easy for me to not worry about it and just remember that like all things, it would end eventually. Conversely, today a wasp started flying around me and I freaked out and ran away. In all likelihood the wasp would not have stung me and I would've been fine if I had just stayed calm and not moved.

I thought I'd tell you a story you might find interesting.  I've been visiting this larger city recently in the USA and have been going to this Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant.  Last time I was there the owner who is this Taiwanese lady started talking to me about Taoism.  She's like 40 or 50-ish and said her whole life she was never religious until about five years ago.  She said her husband was diagnosed with cancer and had only a couple days / weeks to live but he stopped eating meat and starting studying taoism and ended up living another two years after that.  According to her meat is harder to digest and is not only bad for your body but is bad for your karma (I'm not a vegetarian, just repeating what she told me).

Anyway she gave me a bunch of literature about Taoism.  Most of it is bilingual Chinese / English and it looks like they were all published by the [Happy Buddha Temple](http://www.happybuddhatemple.org/).   They have a library where you can read most of these.

* *Shower of Wisdom: A Collection of Teacher Ji-Gong's Works (濟公老師慈語綠)*
* *The Great Learning (大學)*
* *The Revelation of General Douglas MacArthur*
* *The Testimony of Tao Through Parables and Scriptures in the Bible*
* *Introduction to Dao (先天大道 簡介)* (completely in Chinese)
* *The Revelation of Jesus Christ*

A couple things stood out.

1) She pronounces it ""Daoism"" with a hard ""D"".

2) She said we're all caught in a cycle of rebirth and build up karma over a long time but once you start studying Daoism I'm pretty sure she said your past karma stops being important.

3) She said the ""Dao"" (道 = road) is the path ""back to God"".

4) She talked about a state of mind that's positive and not governed by negative emotions like greed.

5) She talked a lot about Buddhism and Confucianism and some of the literature she gave me also does this.  I think it was all kind of the same to her.  Like the Buddha, Confucius, and probably Jesus (had I asked) were all studiers of the Dao.

I've been wanting to learn about Taoism for a while now so I'm looking forward to reading some of this.  She also talked about this Taoist master who goes city to city giving seminar and stuff, but it kind of sounded like he does faith healing.  Anyway I guess if you want to try your luck feel free to ask about Taoism at your local Chinese restaurant.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,False,,,True,t3_z5mfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/z5mfx/got_a_bunch_of_taoist_literature_from_a_taiwanese/,

During my last stretch of abstinence, after 30 days I felt a lot 'cleaner' spiritually, everything felt simpler, and I felt a lot less tired. Unfortunately that final day was a bad one, I had an argument and I watched some pornography to cheer me up. I didn't masturbate or orgasm, but watched enough to feel all the old stirrings again.

The next day I felt very low in energy again, and quite anxious. Pretty much most of the confidence I'd built up over the past month had disappeared.

I feel like there must be some other form of sexual energy release other than through orgasm, merely concentrated lust itself dissipates the body of energy. I'm not religious myself but when I have dabbled I've found the Eastern beliefs to be more convincing, **are there any books that talk about abstinence and the processes it involves in more detail?**

Any advice? ,curiouscretin,16,1,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1ac5vm/imbalance_and_inner_conflict_any_advice/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I seek input on a situation that, whilst known to me for many years, has become more obvious as of late. Inside I feel there are two competing selves. One is the pure me. The untainted, pure, natural state that is happy and peaceful, that wants to help others selflessly, that doesn't need to seek enlightenment because it knows it's already here in the Now. The other, and I feel this is just as natural, is aggressive, cautious, self serving, prone to anger, and seeks something to satiate itself. 

Now, I lived a long time only knowing the latter and rarely the former. Taoism has introduced me to new ways of thinking and has profoundly influenced my life these past 5 years. As I worked to peel away the layers of ego through quieting the mind and contemplation, I became more at peace, happier, more willing to help, and ""present."" It seems, though, that the more layers I strip away, the more the beast within fights for survival. It feels like an atavistic trait trying to break free from my genetic code, begging to let it express itself; a reemergence of those ancient animal survival instincts. 

My concern is that I am trying to suppress this side of myself. I know that it is as natural to me as the air I breath, however it has caused great harm to myself and others in the past. I feared it. I hated it. I call it an it instead of me. I have separated myself from myself. I suppose that may be my issue. I was lacking the peaceful side, so I sought to replace one with another, rather than simply balancing it out. Instead of reaching balance and harmony, I ran to the other extreme. Now I am dealing with the push and pull scenario of my inner yin and yang. 

In time, with meditation, patience, and contemplation, these two sides will meld into one (it's already One, but they will act harmoniously as one), so this post really isn't so much about asking for help or speaking concern. Honestly, I really just wanted to voice my thoughts on what's been going through my head recently to a group of people I think would understand. If anyone can relate, please share your experiences.

It says near the beginning, ""Therefore the Sage, when he governs, empties their minds and fills their bellies, weakens their inclinations and strengthens their bones. His constant object is to keep the people without knowledge and without desire, or to prevent those who have knowledge from daring to act.""

And later, ""In ancient times those who knew how to practise Tao did not use it to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them ignorant. The difficulty of governing the people arises from their having too much knowledge.""

Am I reading this correctly? According to Taoism, should the populace be kept ignorant and without knowledge? Or am I misreading it and/or lacking context for what is being said?

Those who are not good he also regards as good.

I'm feeling unsure on consulting an ""oracle"" to develop my beginning practice.  At a glance the book feels much more mystical than I feel comfortable with.

To me the Tao is that unanswerable question that I will always have. It is that boundless, eternal thing that I can put my entire faith in but can never adequately define. It is that uncaused cause; that exception to the rule; that inconsistency in the logic; that omniscient, all-powerful, and beautiful force that drives everything that I can and cannot perceive to exist. I have been told by some that what I am describing does not exist and there others who say it cannot be named. Many have told me I've got it all wrong and am I experiencing something else but to me, that has been manifested as what I like to call the Tao.

    To use words but rarely
    Is to be natural.

    Hence a gusty wind cannot last all morning, and a sudden downpour cannot last all day.
    Who is it that produces these? Heaven and earth.
    If even heaven and earth cannot go on forever, much less can man.
    That is why one follows the way.

    A man of the way conforms to the way;
    A man of virtue conforms to virtue;
    A man of loss conforms to loss.
    He who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way;
    He who conforms to virtue is gladly accepted by virtue;

I was thinking earlier today, after seeing the movie ""Stranger Than Fiction"" on my shelf-- by the way, if you don't know, this is actually a pretty decent and genuinely good Will Ferrel movie-- and wondered how a Taoist would approach his situation.

Anyway, Howard Crick has his boring life turn around once he stops taking life so seriously, like a Taoist. However, once his english professor/shrink reads the author's draft, he tells Howard that he needs to die. He tells Howard that there is no death that could be more beautiful, poetic, or (it is implied) quick than the one written for him. Howard is obviously very upset and has a breakdown. So my question is this: Would you fight it? After having a new life, getting a girl you loved, etc., would you ""go against the flow"" even though you knew it meant you were ruining what people might remember as a ""beautiful life""? fdnaj  jdaup  feauehhguea  fjda jlg    df ueafebnan fehua  hfohaef  nfdsahfd  end spoilers

Here is my second question: How do Taoists feel when it comes to violence? Do they only go to war in a draft? Would they dodge a draft if they feel the war is for an unjust cause?

Obviously my main question is about the movie, and I am unsure if spoiler tags work in this subreddit so I used an old tactic that worked in a forum I used to hang out on

You'll have to forgive the philosophizing, which I'm pretty sure is frowned upon by most taoists as being pointless and distracting. But we might as well have some kind of discussion going on in a discussion board.

Physicalism, or materialism, is the philosophical idea that everything that exists is whatever's physical or material - the *stuff* in the universe is all there is. Our consciousness is an illusion, all our emotions and brain patterns are neural patterns, and so on. This is the strictly scientific view.

Dualism is the idea that there is something ""else"" that exists ""outside"" the material. The particulars vary from there - reincarnation, life after death, living souls; there are many flavors. This is generally considered a ""religious"" or ""spiritual"" perspective.

It would seem that these ideas are mutually exclusive - it must be one or the other, it can't be both. Either everything is material, or everything isn't material. Western society's seeming obsession with the battle between the two has been raging since Ancient Greece.

But one of Taoism's great themes is the unity of all things. It's not alone among the eastern philosophies for a sort of monist worldview, but in Taoism I've found it best expressed - all things are all things, and therefore are one and the same. (I'll assume I'm preaching to the choir on this point, which is of course the most difficult to get across to most people, but hopefully won't be an issue here. Feel free, by the way, to disagree and posit a better wording or perspective.)

The key is that taoists wouldn't recognize a difference between the spiritual and the material. These are two labels slapped on different ""parts"" of the Tao. Since existence, to a taoist, is essentially experiential, what's important isn't distinguishing between materials and non-materials, but recognizing all things as part of your experience, and therefore part of everything. Any other way is as pointless as identifying an ""absolute east"".

Of course, this doesn't mean science or religion are wrong. A scientist is only using a certain tool set to achieve his goals. But the deepest questions of life can never be answered by him, and even the answers he does have are approximate. The priest does the same - he answers other questions, but never with perfect accuracy, and always with a strong bias towards what worked for him.

Only the Tao unifies all, is blind to bias, and transcends perspective.

Do you think you can clear your mind by sitting constantly in silent meditation? This makes your mind narrow, not clear. Integral awareness is fluid and adaptable, present in all places and at all times. That is true meditation. Who can attain clarity and simplicity by avoiding the world? The Tao is clear and simple, and it doesn't avoid the world. Why not simply honor your parents, love your children, help your brothers and sisters, be faithful to your friends, care for your mate with devotion, complete your work cooperatively and joyfully, assume responsibility for problems, practice virtue without first demanding it of others, understand the highest truths yet retain an ordinary manner? That would be true clarity, true simplicity, true mastery.

Therefore, verse 80 (below) gives me some trouble.

I think there's no way around this one, but a partial way to get around it is to say that one should be occupied with one's work: so an inventor who is constantly inventing and improving, and enjoying the ""labor of his hands"" would be following this; but an inventor who invents things to do his work for him *and then he stops* would be going against the tao.

Another example is a person who works very hard to become independently wealthy so they can ""live off the interest"" would be going against the tao - but if they continued to be active and laboring at the same task (as many wealthy people do), or at another one, then they would be more in accord with the tao.

An example closer to verse 80, is someone who invents something to make them rich (or writes music, a book etc), and then stops. Some companies are like this; but most go the other way, and are continually improving their product, creating similar products and new product lines altogether (e.g. intel was mainly a memory company before they invented the microprocessor; Nintendo made playing cards). For these companies, although they are making labor saving machines, it doesn't stop them from laboring.

As I said, I don't think this gets around verse 80; but I think the above is a way for an inventor to live that is *partly* in accord with the tao.

You see, ignorance alone does not make one blissful. Think to your own past, and you can think of many moments where you did not know something and the not knowing made you frustrated or even angry.  One must be aware of their lack of knowledge or understanding, and also be accepting of it, not wasting much time and effort fretting over simple ignorance.


People who consider themselves smart do often worry themselves with things such as science and religion. However, there is some debate on how much can be *known*—and proven undeniably—through either science or religion.  (The only thing known absolutely is I perceive my reality in my own way, and you perceive your reality in your own way.  We will agree upon some things, but oftentimes there will be discrepancies—sometimes without compromise.  The “real” reality is beyond our grasp, and we are limited in experience, knowledge and understanding by the human form we take.  Collectively, we can aim to pool our minds, thereby gaining more perspectives and perhaps a slightly less dim image of ourselves and the rest of existence, but still we fall short—even with the internet.) Although some religions and some science can be very convincing, and though we may even accept some things as truths collectively or personally, there is no belief system that stands up to scrutiny without at some point attributing some part to faith. (Science is included, because many have put their faith in science—some without ever studying any field—and they trust theories such as The Big Bang or The Multiverse or what have you.)  And faith really means that we trust our “gut feeling” or “the most logical solution to the riddle” (logic only providing the most likely scenario, not a record of the event itself), which relies wholly on *perspective*.

So why are the ignorant blissful? In the end, we are all undeniably limited by our own perspectives, and everyone is pretty ignorant in one way or another…so maybe this has little do to with ignorance after all. Rather, those who see the struggle of others to convince everyone of their views, and who see the battles, both intellectual and brutal, that take place over and over between these convicted, devout, patriotic peoples with never a clear victor—those who recognize the folly and futility in this internal and continually externally realized Kampf are obliged to step out of themselves and this world for a moment or more to ask themselves what the struggle is for….

I plan on leaving and hitchhiking around the country, a desire Ive had for a while that has really only manifested as a possibility within the last year and half.

**Introduction**

Dialectics is the study of change. It is a way of thinking that tries to explain how change works, and why. Dialectics has been around for thousands of years, but it isn't very well known in most of the Western world. There are reasons for this, which we will explore later in this article. But first, let's find out more about what dialectics is.

**The Study of Change**

Why study change? The answer is simple. Dialectics believes that change is all there is. Everything is change. A popular statement reflecting this viewpoint is ""change is the only constant."" Most people believe this to be true and insightful when they hear it, without realizing that most of Western culture is based on the opposite viewpoint, that things are somehow static, fixed, permanent, and eternal. But this opposing viewpoint doesn't contradict dialectics, as we will discover. Instead, it affirms dialectics by being the antithesis of the dialectical viewpoint itself. But before that can make any sense, we have to find out about an important concept known as the unity of opposites.

**The Unity of Opposites**

The Unity of Opposites is the idea that things that seem to be opposed are actually united in a deeper sense. The best way to understand this idea is to use real-world examples. The early Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who was the father of dialectical thought in the West, used the example of a bow. The bowstring and the wooden part of the bow move in opposite directions, but they are both necessary parts of the whole. Without either of them, there is no bow. The existence of the bow itself depends on the opposition of the bow string and the wooden backbone. When these two aspects of the bow are drawn in opposite directions, the bow becomes capable of its function. Male and female to reproduce, in and out go the tides to churn the ocean, the piston does up and down and the wheels turn round.  This is the unity of opposites.


**Monism**

Monism is the idea that everything in the world is made from a single undivided ""substance."" It doesn't matter what the substance is, the important thing is that it is a single substance that everything comes from, rather than two or more substances. This may seem like a strange thing to worry about, but it's really very important, because much of Western culture is based on the idea that there are two basic substances in the world, usually called ""mind"" and ""body"" or ""spirit"" and ""matter."" This view is called dualism, and it is the basis of most of the things modern Westerners believe.

But monism, which has always been much more popular in the Eastern world, says that there really aren't two substances, even though it might seem that way. Everything comes from and is always a part of a single undivided reality, which could be called Tao, Void, God, Nothingness, or any number of things. Some of these names for the ""one substance"" may seem to contradict each other, but they really don't. They are just different names for the same thing, or the same ""nothing."" But that is a very complicated matter, and before we can make sense of it, we need to understand where dialectics fits into the picture.

**Dialectical Monism**

Dialectical Monism is the basic metaphysical position of dialectics itself. Metaphysics is the part of philosophy that is concerned with questions like ""is there really only one kind of thing in the world, or are there two or more?"" Even though dialectics talks about everything having two ""sides,"" it uses the idea of the Unity of Opposites to show that they are ""two sides of the same coin."" So, as we discovered in the previous section on Monism, there is really only one ""substance"" which the whole world is made from, but that substance always takes the form of complementary opposites.

This can be a very confusing idea for some people, because it's hard to understand how everything could be one undivided reality and also be composed of opposites at the same time. But the answer is a simple one, once we know where to look for it. To understand why the single ""substance"" of the world always appears as opposing things interacting with each other, it's necessary to understand the nature of consciousness.

The sub-sections are going to get a bit longer now, because the remaining material might be trickier for some readers. But we will try to keep it as straightforward as we can, considering the subject matter.

**The Nature of Consciousness**

Consciousness is the self-aware state of the human brain. The brain is a small part of the world which has become so complex in its structure that it has achieved the ability to be aware of itself and the rest of the world. The result of this ability is the set of thinking processes known as the mind.

Ideas such as dialectics are concepts. In order to create concepts, the mind has to distinguish one thing from another thing. It isn't possible to have a thought without making a distinction. This is why even though the world is really a single undivided substance, it always appears to us as a collection of things interacting with each other. In order to have thoughts, the mind creates things in the conceptual sense by making distinctions within the undivided whole.

However, this doesn't mean that things aren't ""real."" It just means that they are segments of the whole which are defined by the human mind's ability to infer relationships. In other words, they don't exist independently of other things. Things are like waves on the ocean. No waves exist apart from the ocean itself, and the ocean ""is"" the waves in a very real sense. But for a sailor in a small boat, it can be very useful to distinguish one wave from another. The human brain and mind are survival tools. They allow us to make distinctions and have thoughts, because some ""waves"" on the ocean (aspects of the whole) are very bad for our health and we need to be able to deal with them, or we die.

The dualistic nature of thought can be easily demonstrated by considering how we can think about any ""thing"" we can think about. For example, a lamp cannot be defined as a lamp without creating a distinction between ""the lamp"" and ""everything else that is not the lamp."" Like all thoughts, this creates a dualistic distinction. Even though we understand that monism is true, anytime we think, we establish dualism in our own minds. So, while monism is true of the world, dualism is true of the mind. That is what is meant by ""dialectical monism."" This is also why Zen masters and other mystics stress getting rid of thought to perceive the world directly, but that's another issue.

For now, let's go back to the unity of opposites, but instead of focusing on how the opposing things are the same at a deeper level, let's focus on how they are opposed as the human mind sees it.

**Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis**

Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis is the ""formula of dialectics."" Scholars don't always like these terms, because the people who helped create most of the important concepts in dialectics didn't use them. But they are useful in spite of this, and they make the concepts involved easier to understand.

A thesis is any thing, idea, or other distinction, and an antithesis is the opposite of that thesis. It's important to note that the antithesis doesn't always have to be the ""exact opposite"" in the way we usually think of opposites. For example, in the case of the lamp we discussed in the previous article, the antithesis of ""the lamp"" was given as ""everything that is not the lamp."" In other words, thesis and antithesis are context-dependent. It isn't important that we find the ""exact opposite"" in the usual sense, but instead, we should find the opposite that is meaningful within the given context.

Now we are getting to the interesting part. In the Introduction section, it was stated that dialectics is ""the study of change,"" but so far not much has been said about that subject. That will change in the next subsection.

**Principles of Change**

Change is the result of a thesis interacting with its antithesis. For example, when a piece of ice is dropped into a hot frying pan, thesis (cold) and antithesis (heat) interact, resulting in change - the ice melts and the pan fills with water. This process is known as synthesis.

But it doesn't stop there. Each time a synthesis is created, it becomes a new thesis which begins to change due to the influence of its antithesis. The water in the pan won't stay there forever, even if the heat is turned off. It will begin evaporating due to other factors in the environment, which serve as the antithesis of the new thesis. Wherever there is a thesis (any thing, idea, or distinction of any kind), there will be an antithesis, and therefore the process of change is never-ending. New syntheses are continuously created and transformed as they become theses themselves.

There is nothing in the world that is immune to change and transformation. This is actually very simple to understand if we have followed the previous sections. The only thing that is constant is the single undivided reality of being, or ""the ocean."" But this ocean is not a ""thing"" like the oceans on Earth. Our oceans can be distinguished from their antithesis, land. But the ocean of being cannot be distinguished from any other ""thing"" because it contains all things. There is nothing outside it, therefore it cannot be envisioned, conceptualized, or thought about. It can only be experienced directly.

The direct experience of undivided reality is available to us at all times, but when we are thinking, we are dividing reality, making distinctions, and creating conceptual ""things."" That's why dialectics is the study of things and how they change. It is not just a way of thinking about the world, it is a way of thinking about how people think.

**Progress**

Progress is a description of how change looks from a human perspective over long periods of time. As new syntheses are constantly created, the state of the world becomes increasingly complex. While a more complex state is not ""better"" from a disinterested ""objective"" perspective, increasing complexity in human affairs is motivated by the necessity of survival and therefore tends to result in survival-enhancing outcomes over the long term.

This may sound very ""academic,"" but it is easily demonstrated in everyday life. For example, human lifespans have been continuously extended from 30-40 years in primitive times to 70-80 years today. Living conditions for a large portion of the world's population have improved by a similar degree. For larger and larger areas of the world, much of the drudgery, hard physical labor, and pain of life has been eliminated through modern labor-saving devices, medicines, and improvements across the whole spectrum. Many painful and even fatal diseases which once killed millions have been entirely wiped out. Slavery is no longer practiced in developed nations. Science has uncovered increasingly useful truths about the natural world which have led to countless advancements.

Despite all this, the concept of progress has become less popular in recent years, owing largely to the devastating wars of the 20th century and the social upheaval which followed. As a result, many people no longer buy the idea that human society is ""going anywhere."" While war and conflict are undeniably tragic, this view ignores the reality that many of the most important advancements in history have resulted from them. Heraclitus said that ""war is king of all and father of all."" While this statement may be understandably uncomfortable to modern audiences, even that discomfort is evidence of progress - we are gradually becoming increasingly humane in our outlook and less willing to tolerate the outrages and abuses of war. War makes us uncomfortable, whereas a thousand years ago, our lives might have centered around its glory.

Progress is a constant process, but it is not a linear one. In the short-term view of a single human lifespan, it does not go ""directly forward"" without setbacks or reversals. In fact, setbacks and reversals are what ultimately drive progress forward, because a synthesis cannot be obtained unless an antithesis interacts with any given thesis. To use an anaolgy, unless the away team wins some of the games, the home team doesn't learn much, and may not go on to win the state championship next year as a result.

Even though nobody can tell you whether a single coin flip will come up heads or tells with any accuracy, it's easy to figure out what the result of a million coin flips will be to a good degree of accuracy. Similarly, while we may not know exactly what the next scientific advancement will be or who will win an upcoming election, over very long time scales, progress has a predictable course. If we understand that nature of things and how change works, we can look at the whole course of human history and use it to figure out what will happen in the future with a high level of confidence.

If this sounds difficult to believe, it is only because dialectics has not been taught in most of the Western world, so people have no tools to use for the job. There are very good reasons for this, and most of them have to do with the best interests of those who have the most money and power in Western society. It isn't in their interest for ordinary people to understand dialectics, history, or the future. This isn't an organized ""conspiracy theory,"" it's just human nature. The ""powers that be"" are benefiting from things just the way they are, so why should they want people to understand the nature of change? Naturally, they aren't going to go out of their way to teach anyone that sort of thing, and that's part of the reason this article exists.

When Frédéric Bastiat and Gustave de Molinari expressed their wonder at the beauty of the free market, the underlying intelligence through which a superorganism of humans arrives at a natural balance of production and cooperation without any authority telling them to produce or cooperate, they were expressing their wonder at the nation's Li, which leads to economic growth and prosperity for humans just as surely as the free flow of tree sap leads to the shape and structure of the woodgrain that best ensures the growth of our magnificent trees and forests.""

Living in the west (Atlanta, Georgia to be precise), in a city that isn't as even metropolitan enough to have its own Chinatown (I know that New York and San Francisco have a couple Taoist temples), I've yet to truly find someone other than my best friend who understands the word of Tao. So, I thought to show my appreciation, I would share with you my story on how I was ""converted"", persay, to Taoism.
I was raised slightly Christian, but never went to Church. My father, who was raised Baptist, had a disdain for organized religion. Stumbling upon a yoga book when I was around six, that was my first interest in Eastern philosophy. Up until age nine or ten, I kept to myself about it, and started to consider myself a blend of Red-Letter Christianity and Buddhist. As I aged and found myself juxtaposed against the environment of middle school, however, I was soon bullied due to my religious beliefs. I stayed away from religion for a few years after that, and two years ago my father gave me two books to read: ""The Tao of Pooh"" by Benjamin Hoff and ""Illusions"", by Richard Bach. While the former should be a fun read recognizable for any Taoist, Illusions was something different. Illusions, as I would later discover, encompasses just so much of Taoist philosophy from a Western standpoint. Quotes like ""We are but the otters of the universe"" and ""Living your life is like going to the movies"" peppered the lovely little piece of fiction. Just recently my best friend told me how he found a copy of the Tao De Ching, with Chinese and English transliterations. I borrowed it, and read. And read. And read. Words of politics, philosophy, ethics and morality that spoke to me more than any Christian prayer or Buddhist koan. It was sublime. I closed the book and felt...at peace. For the first time in a long time, I was like the uncarved block, with no emotion present except a simple, pleasant contentment. Since then, I've just recently finished Daniel Reed's ""The Tao of Health, Sex and Longevity"", and I can say that the Taoist life, the life that strives to being an adept, has changed me. I have also embraced the animistic and shamanistic qualities of Taoism, something which has gotten me much flack from my peers once again. But I do not care. I spend my days meditating, exercising, brewing tonics and elixars. I have meditated to a state of deep conscious self-reflection, and have even communed with what I can only call a ""spirit guide"", but that is another story for another time.

**A Personal Interpretation**

The first paragraph in this chapter, I believe, is referring to the role of contrast in defining an idea's existence. For example: if I placed a black dot on a white sheet of paper I can tell it's existence due to the contrast. If the dot was pure white like the paper, I could not tell it's existence through visual methods alone. It would be indistinguishable from the paper. What I extrapolate from this is that in order for an idea to be considered to exist it must have an equal and opposite counter-idea to give it ""shape"", or to define it's ""border"".
The second paragraph, I interpret, is giving examples of this realization - showing the dependence of extremes on other extremes. This could be seen as the concept of Yin &amp; Yang in action.

I've recently become interested in researching the philosophical side of taosim and applying the guidance of the 道德经 to my life. I've studied Chinese martial arts for 8 years, Mandarin Chinese for 3, and have recently been struggling with being atheist but still seeking guidance and philosophical depth in my life. To me these combine to make learning about Taoism the next logical step.

I plan on picking up The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet, as I read the first part of the former and found it accessible and refreshing. Are there any other such books along these lines of light hearted and not incredibly mind blowing introductions, particularly to Yinyang, Wuwei, and Wuxing?

I also plan on reading the TaoTeChing in short order, but am debating whether or not to read it in modern Mandarin or English my first time through. My Mandarin is good enough to understand the text with minimal dictionary work if I get a modern version, but my comprehension of English is much better, as it is my native language. Has anybody attempted reading it in Chinese first? Does anybody have a good side-by-side translation version (online or hardcopy source) to recommend? 

I was given a copy of TaoTeChing in Mandarin with Pinyin (pronunciation/romanization) last year by a DaoShi (Taoist priest? I don't actually know how to refer to them in English...)and may just use that. I've also greatly enjoyed visiting the many temples around Beijing, including the White Cloud Temple just last weekend.

Thanks in advance for any guidance or recommendations anyone may have. I searched the sub extensively I promise, but the language issue is really what I am most curious about.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,False,,,True,t3_1jfa92,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1jfa92/philosophical_daoism_where_to_start_what_to_read/,

While they are linked, eventually (6 months? 1 year?) the posts will get archived and no one will be able to comment on them. Should we repost them cyclically? Should we write a bot? A bot would take the heart out of choosing a translation in the OP post (yay random selection), but it would make life very easy.

For writing a bot I would probably do it at the end of this first cycle. It wouldn't take me long, but if anyone else out there is a programmer or wants to learn, let me know. I've been pretty busy but I'm sure I'll be able to find time before chapter 81 rolls around.

Way breeds one, one breeds two, two breeds three, three breeds the many things;  
The many things bear shade yet harbor light;  
Fumes are cleared through harmonious being.  
A man arrives at a dreadful spot;  
A lone orphan, widowed, not prosperous. But the Noble Universal acts methodically.  
Amid passing things, ruin may come, but it is profitable; profit may come, but it is ruinous.  
The man arrives at a place of learning; Self also arrives at learning.  
Mighty crossing: those who do not attain, perish.  
We are nourished through service to the teachings of the Elders.

----EDIT---- 
Updated translation:

Way sprouts one, one sprouts two, two sprouts three, three sprouts the myriad beings.  
The myriad beings bear dark yet cradle light;  
Harmonious outpouring of vitality.^1  
A man arrives at a dreadful place;  
A lone orphan, widowed, not prosperous. But the Noble Universal acts appropriately.  
Thus beings may reach loss, but gain; may reach gain, but lose.  
The man arrives at a teaching place; the arrival of teaching also manifests.^2  
Mighty crossing: those who do not attain, perish.  
We are nourished through the practice of the teachings of the elders. 

^1 Qi, I completely missed this the first time. I was tempted to use vim but that's probably too obscure.  
^2 我 means to announce oneself, to manifest. It represents a hand holding an axe. Coincidentally, manifests come from Latin manus + festus, struck by hand. The sentence is kind of awkward but reflects the structure of the original as grammatically as possible.

However, I do notice what I take to be misconceptions about Taoism occasionally, not necessarily on this subreddit but just in general when I discuss the Tao with friends.  An example would be that Taoism is about ""going with the flow"".  This is true, but only to a limited extent.  To be sure, the central concept of wu-wei would seem to prescribe letting things be, and it does, but to me wu-wei can also be used to oppose the direction in which things are going (e.g. a boycott as a form of protest).  Also, we find Lao Tzu prescribing action when appropriate in chapter 29 of the Tao Te Ching:

*In fact, for all things there is a time for going ahead, and a time for following behind;*

*A time for slow-breathing and a time for fast-breathing;*

*A time to grow in strength and a time to decay;*

*A time to be up and a time to be down.*

*Therefore, the Sage avoids all extremes, excesses and extravagances.*

Then, painstakingly copy and paste your passage character by character into http://www.chineseetymology.org/ to get the translation and etymology for the character. It might help to have your preferred English translation for comparison as you go along. I've also been copying the characters on a notepad by hand as I go along to aid in memorization. I know it sounds like a lot of work but it's really awesome, once you've made sense of how the pictures relate to the character's meaning it's really easy to remember, and once you've done the whole passage you can basically go back and re-read it in Chinese, and actually understand. It's beyond awesome.

It really works, too. On a bathroom/bong rip break, I was able to mentally recall all the characters I'd done so far and their meaning... It's THAT intuitive once you get it.

God bless the roots! -- Body and soul are one!

The small become the great, the great the small;

The right thing happens to the happy man.




Child of the dark, he can out leap the sun,

His being single, and that being all;

The right thing happens to the happy man.




Or he sits still, a solid figure when

The self-destructive shake the common wall;

Takes to himself what mystery he can.




And, praising change as the slow night comes on,

I've looked around online for a place in my area (I live in Tampa, Florida) where there might be Taoist meetings but there was no such luck. 

I would say I've mostly embraced Taoism rather than changed myself toward its ideals (like becoming the sage). I'm not sure how much influence the philosophy could have over someone who doesn't have tendencies of embracing different cultures or flowing like natural currents. 

There are some aspects of Taoism which I don't accept (and maybe just don't have a full understanding over them). Wu wei for example seems to be almost like condoning anti-productivity and the concept of being one with the world seems almost like conformity. I believe in finding peace within yourself and within your world, but I also feel that being a good worker and going against the main consensus is essential for progress and well-being.

My main point in writing this is to basically admit that I'm not sure what to get out of Taoism even though I think its general message has a lot to offer. I'm not sure how to really apply it to my life but I kind of think I would feel more homely in society if more people embraced the philosophy and lived by its teachings to a certain extent.

I'm not getting much love on the r/DebateReligion subreddit, so I'd be interested in a Taoist response to this thesis.  Some of the examples in this post I've given here on r/Taoism, so forgive any repetition.  I'm basically trying to account for how a loving God could have created evil in the world, though from a non-Christian perspective, more as a thought experiment than anything else.  Any thoughts?

Here is my post:

I am certain someone else has proposed a similar solution, so I claim no originality here. This thought was prompted by chapter II of the Tao Te Ching.

You can't have up without down. You can't have positive without negative. You can't have good without evil.

That's it. But, allow me to flesh this thought out a bit.

God as conceived by most religions is a non-dual being. Independent of time, beyond comprehension to our limited, worldly minds, the ultimate being is just that: Ultimate. It encompasses everything, all possibilities and potentialities. I do not know whether such a being exists, and venture no guess. However, assuming that there is such a being, and assuming further that it does contain within it all possibilities, would it not be absurd, perhaps even worse, to question the possibility of evil existing?

Not only that, but in order to have any sort of opposing polarities at all, they must be mutually arising. Similarly to hot and cold or rich and poor, good and evil are relative to one another, they each determine the boundary in to which the other cannot intrude. Sure some things can be neutral or neither good nor evil, but the very possibility of good is necessarily dependent on the possibility of evil. Here is a concrete example of how this is the case:

If I were to show you a blank sheet of white paper, you would not be able to get any information from it. If I then take black ink and draw a circle on it, you can see a circle, by virtue of the fact that there is a thing that is the circle (composed of ink) and a thing that is not the circle (the blank part of the page). Then if I take the black ink and dump it all over the page, you will no longer have a circle, since there is no distinction between circle and non-circle. You cannot have one without the other.

Now, take the Judeo-Christian conception of God-the-Father. As far as I understand, a traditional interpretation is that the Judeo-Christian God is infinitely loving. However, God is also responsible for the creation of a being known as Satan, which as far as I can tell, is infinitely treacherous and full of hatred... hatred toward God, humanity, creation, everything. How could it be that an infinitely loving God is capable of producing an being of infinite hatred?

How could it be any other way?

Apart from the fact that an ultimate being is capable of anything, in our limited world there is no possibility of good without evil. This is to say nothing of God's ability to have good without evil, only that we can't. Good and evil set measure to each other. To have only one polarity is to have nothing. This is why there is evil in the world, because without it, there would be no good.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,False,,,True,t3_1i2rmx,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1i2rmx/a_taoist_interpretation_of_the_problem_of_evil/,

I'm a PhD student from Melbourne, Australia, currently doing some research into psychological well-being and how it results from the goals and aspirations we have in life. 

The basic theory is derived from Iain McGilchrist (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFs9WO2B8uI) who suggests that the left hemisphere of the brain sees the world in a fragmented, atomistic, 'mechanistic' way. The right brain he suggests is more 'holistic' - it sees the interdependencies and relationships which connect all things within the big picture. I'm also influenced by Arran Gare, a process philosopher who has suggested that the dominant metaphysics of Western civilisation (i.e., the inherent understanding of the nature of existence and the way that life 'is') is mechanistic materialism. He explains it similarly to McGilchrist and also suggests that this mindset sees people not as complex, unique individuals, but as means to an end. Similarly, the environment is not seen as complex ecosystems that all things require for life, but as exploitable resources for human gain. 

I was drifting around reddit and came across this:

""""All things are at one with Infinity.
When humanity is centered in this oneness:
the sky remains clear and beautiful, the earth remains pure and sustains life, the spirit of humanity is in harmony, the valley is the source of abundance, all creatures reproduce, regenerate and replenish the earth, leaders and kings are in harmony and nations are at peace.
When humanity focuses on the manifestations of Infinity, distinguishes and judges all things and thereby forgets the oneness of Infinity:
the sky becomes cloudy with pollution, the earth becomes a cesspool unable to easily neutralize the many poisons, the spirit of humanity becomes confused and accepts conflict as the nature of humanity, the valley no longer produces abundance and what it does produce is tainted. Leaders and kings take their nations to war in order to control the untainted lands, creatures no longer reproduce, species die out and parts of the earth, unattended by the myriad creatures, no longer regenerate or replenish themselves, the people of all nations live in conflict, fear, hunger and depression.""
What is your favourite interpretation of the Tao? What is the single greatest message you get from it? The text still resonates with me after all this time, it provides such a simple solution to all our problems, and yet, every day it seems we get further away. Do you file the Tao under ""new age""?
Oneness with infinity, that's all we need."" (http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/ktcpq/the_tao_te_ching_on_the_problems_of_our/)

I thought there was a bit of an overlap between the theory guiding my research and Taoist philosophy, so I thought I'd post here. I'd be really interested in any ideas people might have or books that you think I should read. Just in case you're interested in what I'm doing, here's the link to the second survey comprising my PhD: http://opinio.online.swin.edu.au/s?s=12375 

A major aspect of my thesis is looking at consumer materialism and how it arises as a result of reifying the abstract connotations associated with objects (from an idea called the Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness), which I think is also relevant to Taoist perspectives.

--

Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao,
Counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe.
For this would only cause resistance.
Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed.
Lean years follow in the wake of a great war.
Just do what needs to be done.
Never take advantage of power.

Achieve results,
But never glory in them.
Achieve results,
But never boast.
Achieve results,
But never be proud.
Achieve results,
Because this is the natural way.
Achieve results,
But not through violence.

Force is followed by loss of strength.
This is not the way of Tao.

Essentially she was raised Jewish (Jewish mother, Catholic father) and he is Christian (whole family is), but neither really practices in a formal fashion anymore.  She is under pressure from her mother to raise her kids Jewish and my cousin would rather them be raised Christian or even have a dual approach (expose kids to both religions equally).  This seems to be causing some friction in the relationship.

So, what should my cousin do?  

 * 1-Stand his ground Christian only

 * 2-Go with his middle ground idea of exposure to both religions equally and fairly or even no formal exposure to either (he would do both, she has yet to agree to either)

 * 3-concede to the Jewish only option as her father had done?

 * 4-other?

What I mean is.. For example some buddhism branches seem to have a lot of agendas or aims or goals (my limited understanding): spreading dharma, helping every being to enlightenment (mahayana bodhisatva stuff) in addition to personal development, etc.. 

I don't see any taoists going door-to-door like Jemima's witnesses to spread the word or trying to help every being ""to the other side"" or banging drums wearing yellow robes. On the other hand, I'm not located in the most taoisty part of out teensy planet.

Hard work, complicated papers, a lot of tension, etc.

I used to be very anxious, to the point of getting aches to all my body. I treated that, and during and after my treatment I came to know better the tao. I was already introduced to eastern philosophy and culture, but never came to know what Confucius, Lao Tze and others have said.

Just recently my classes came back from a long period of strike, and I expected even more tension and anxiety, from my teachers, my classmates, the ambient and myself. I came to be wrong. All was going very naturally, except by the fact that in the first days there were a lot of girls turning me on, and my feelings were in a storm.

I don't know what happened today. Maybe is something that I read in here or in a book, but the thought of ""when there is no desire, all things are at peace"" has been in my mind for days. Ever since then, when something happens I always think ""well, I can work around with that"", or when something is about to happen I automatically think ""well, if it goes that way, then it will be so"". Not sadly calm... Something more like ""deadly"" calm, like a calm tactician, a calm engineer who knows no anxiety, and has true passion accomplishing things through the way of the peace and the calm.

As I have told before, I'm still a teenager. I should be considered an adult, yes, but that's not how it works, actually. When I faced the so-tempting girls, the neediness and the emotional storm that previously stroke me so hard could be seen from a distance. I knew they were there, but I myself was in peace. I knew I wanted that, but I also knew I didn't desperately need that, so instead of being ""ohmygod that ass"", ""ohmygod so beautiful"", ""ohmygod so cute"", ""ohmygod so sexy"" all inside, i was more like... ""*long breath* nice girl..."".

The final point is the objectivity. I can think much clearer now, and when I need to update some statistic data for my conclusion of course work, I can do in a few hours what it used to take a few days. No more multifocusing and multitasking, but lots of ""inner preparation"". I went like I already knew how to do it in the most efficient way, with no argues with myself, just ""accepting"" what my mind was ordering. It was like I had done it a lot of times before, but by the way I don't recall adopting such methods before.

It's more like that that peace brings almost instantly to me conclusions that before used to take a long time thinking.

I didn't like what he had to say. ,poekoelan,13,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/jna72/had_a_vivid_dream_where_my_teacher_came_to_visit/,"Backstory: my taoism teacher is also my martial arts teacher. The martial arts and taoism teachings are intertwined and pretty much go hand in hand. Occasionally I'll see him in my dreams and we'll talk (he's still alive).

In the dream, my teacher basically said that I should give up on teaching martial arts, not because my skills are bad, but because I was psychologically imbalanced and had proven that I was unfit to teach martial arts. Although I'm doing something else at the moment, it's always been my dream to teach martial arts full time. I felt very sad when I woke up.

It's probably true - although I was a good student, at a certain point I became very agitated towards my teacher and threatened him with violence, because I thought he had treated my mother badly. It was a very weird situation, hard to unwind. I'll tell the story if there's any interest. Then earlier this year I went joined a muay thai gym and got a little out of hand during sparring, ended up axe-kicking the muay thai teacher in the face and then boasting about it on facebook. A very immature thing to do, and I feel too ashamed to go back to the gym despite paying $150 a month for it. It also seems to me evidence that I am not ready to lead any sort of personal development class, which is what martial arts is to me, much more than just exercise.

What do you think? Should I talk to my teacher in person? Just accept it? Maybe I misinterpreted things... dreams are odd, and he didn't *explicitly* say that I shouldn't teach martial arts, it was more of an overall feeling. Maybe I should just cultivate on my own.

Quite possibly unrelated, but I recently gave up coffee and feel like a different person. The last two years I have been getting more and more into coffee, drinking strong coffee everyday where I never had before. Since I've given it up last week I feel so much calmer, so much less agitated (also my kidneys feel stronger and I don't sweat at night anymore).

Nonyielding - 非收益 - Fēi shōuyì

Follow the rules
of the combat arena.
Inside the cage,
never yield to aggressors.
When outside,
affirm compassion.

~inspired by Deng Ming-Dao

The world and society as a whole are competitive. The sages use the warrior metaphor to show how to meet this competition. Never yield to the aggression of an opponent. Sidestep, but never give way.

Whether you are a lawyer, officer, firefighter, doctor, businessman, athlete, or any other profession, you will invariably come into competition with others in the field (or natural forces which present obstacles in your way). There is a right and a wrong way to compete. Avoid anger and greed. Use concentration and awareness.

It is not mere coincidence that concentration and awareness are also a necessity for spiritual cultivation. This is why followers of Tao incorporate the way of the warrior into spiritual training. The warrior and the sage both seek transcendence of emotion and pettiness as a path to self-perfection - a life lived in pursuit of the deepest truth.

Outside the arena, always remember to be kind. Leave the associated aggression of competition behind. You must still possess awareness, concentration, and reflex but use a different form of expression. Compassion can be exercised in place of force. That is why the combination of these two ways, of the warrior and Tao, can coexist so perfectly. The versatility provided to the complete being cannot be replicated by the brash and boastful swordsman. The complete being commands the extremes of the universe while maintaining the balance within.

 The teachings also suggest that the promptings that create this compulsion are without root – non-abiding (de, shen, self). This basic view is not the RESULT of effort (development of clarity or improvement of any kind) and is where the so-called spiritual path BEGINS not where it ends.

These ideas confine meaning to verbal, communicable, comprehensible information, which is totally fine, but I think if people expanded their idea of meaning to all its possible forms, they would see that each and every thing is filled up to the brim of its identity with its own meaning, with the meaning being exactly what the thing is. There isn't a common language to connect them all, and there doesn't have to be.

One of my more enjoyable pastimes is to see Taoism (or, rather, the principles within) in as many aspects of belief as possible (seeing it in Christianity is absolutely delightful, btw).

Okay. That said, I went through an Abraham-Hicks, Wayne Dyer, ""Manifest Your Dreams"" phase earlier in my life, before immersing in The Way, and I began feeling it quite unnecessary to do anything but love/observe what is in front of me.

However, I'm reading Tao: The Watercourse Way by Alan Watts right now, and I keep having these little niggling ideas about how these two concepts (Taosim and this ""manifestation"" fad) are perhaps interrelated.

In short, the ""manifestation"" principle is a fledgling beginning to observation as seen through Taoism.

In other words, those things which one would wish to ""manifest"" are already there, but through the practice of opening to life (which is a basic idea through manifesting) with INTENTION of seeing/having what you desire to see/have, you're actually just seeing more of what is in front of you and has always been.

Then, like the butcher who cuts where the meat tells him to cut, you make the appropriate moves to bring you and that thing into proximity of each other. By, I don't know, for lack of a better word ... ""right action."" It would appear as if you (your ego/personality) made it happen, but in actually it was just your attention to reality. There is nothing magical or ""you are in ultimate control"" about it.

And, of course, the desire to have something you don't have is stepping, in your mind, outside of your Way. And without the full understanding of ""mutual arising"" and how everything evokes its opposite, you end up with as much ""don't want"" as ""want."" Which is where, I think, the ""manifestation"" idea does a disservice to those it preaches to by not honoring this, and where it deviates harshly from Taoism.

I guess my point in posting this/opening up a discussion about it is that it illustrates, imo, how beliefs/understandings are cycling back into (or have always had aspects of) those based in Taoism. 

And that's why I have an unnaturally strong irritation to those who would scoff at ""those New Agey crackpot beliefs."" It was those beliefs that brought me here in order to let them go with more expansive understanding.

I am currently writing a paper on Taoism for my Asian Religions class. Sometimes I worry I am completely missing the point or not saying much of anything at all. A small snippet is below. I'd be interested in and appreciative of anyone's thoughts/opinions.. However, as I do not want to unintentionally plagiarize, I am most interested in where you may see a contradiction/leap/misunderstanding..

&gt;To apply the Taoist value of the natural to a query, we must first understand what is meant by natural. If we have natural on the one hand, we have unnatural on the other. These two concepts are notions of a greater whole; we must explore that which is complete to understand its components. Taoism sets up this frame of reference through yin and yang. The yin and the yang are two parts of one whole, separate and recognizable on their own right yet encompassed within and flowing into the other. “The world is formed from the void/like utensils from a block of wood” (Mitchell, 28). The ultimate will differentiate but that does not imply that essence is lost. The world comes out of the void, like utensils may come out of a block of wood; at their core, though, the utensils are still formed of and contain the original block of wood.  “The master knows the utensils,/yet keeps to the block:/thus she can use all things” (Mitchell, 28). In order to utilize the full potential of one’s tool set, she must recognize the part but understand the whole. Without yin, yang cannot be comprehended; without yang, yin is lost. The qualities of each need not be equal, only balanced. “The Master allows things to happen./She shapes events as they come./She steps out of the way/and lets the Tao speak for itself” (Mitchell, 45). The Tao, given appropriate space and consideration, will find such a balance. In the balance, we find the natural. The Tao flows in and around all we can conceive of as well as past perception. “Since before time and space were,/the Tao is./It is beyond is and is not. How do I know this is true?/I look inside myself and see” (Mitchell, 21). At once creationary and preservatory, the Tao begets and sustains. Due to this pervasive quality, if followed, the Tao will lead to the natural state of a balanced nature.

(I am continuing now to write on the unnatural, its relationship to the natural, and of course I will be citing Chuang Tzu and the oxen's four legs VS the bull ring)

This post is a call to everyone to create their own Sangha, in order to further your meditative process. For those of you in the NYC surrounding area, I want to organize a bi-weekly meditation/spirituality discussion group so that we may all learn from each other, and help each other through any difficulties. We are here to discuss both positive and negative experiences from meditation and to offer support to other spiritual seekers. I think this differs from the majority of meditation meetups and events, which are often either about studying theory or texts, like the Tao te ching or I ching, silently practicing together, or listening to a talk by a master. To me, group discussion is equally as important as these approaches, and is unfortunately often neglected in spiritual practice. Understanding other meditators and feeling a connection to them is essential to continuing on the Way. 

We meet every two weeks at Whole Foods (Bowery location), 95 East Houston St.

Saturday or Sunday depending on best availability for most members.

The idea for a spirituality/meditation discussion &amp; support group comes from the Buddhist concept of a Sangha:

Obviously many of the people on this subreddit are westerners. Many probably read the Tao Te Ching and other mainstays of Taoism and found the philosophy attractive. However, recently, I've been seeing some people say that when westerners read these foreign texts and then interpret them based on their own western sensibilities that this is something along the lines of religious imperialism, or is at the very least not what the texts/philosophy was meant for. 

Furthermore, in China Taoism usually has a much more traditionally religious aspect to it as far as I know. Most Westerners ignore this aspect, and only practice the underlying philosophy. Is this like claiming to be a Christian if you agree with biblical morality but don't believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ? Is it okay to strip away the religious aspect?

Well I've visited a couple times, but this will be my first post here.  This is how I see wu wei in the river metaphor after absorbing the comments in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/10nrol/having_difficulty_understanding_wu_wei_can/).

There is a river flowing over a seemingly random landscape. The source of the water is too far in the distance to make any presumptions and the destination of the water is obscured by a wall of thick fog that seems to move along at the pace and in the direction of the flowing water. You are in the water and, while capable of maneuvering, you're still very much subject to the occasionally overpowering force of its flow.

Wu wei is not the force of the water against your body for what you can feel through touch is parallel to the tangible and objectively observable present reality, the one we know without doubt.  

Wu wei is not the shifting waves, sharp turns or trouble on the horizon for what you can see through your eyes is parallel to your subjective  perception of your environment beyond the range of your 5 physical senses; your instinct, intuition, or any other emotional guidance. 

Wu wei is not the force that shaped the landscape for wu wei is order and the landscape's artist is chaos.

Wu wei is the gravity within the metaphor, a force applied evenly and universally, it holds the river to the landscape and your body to the water. It is essential to the form of the metaphor, but also essential to its function. It pulls the water, and yourself in it, toward lower ground and you begin to travel over the landscape. From your perspective there is always motion, often turbulent and sometimes confusing yet there are always visual cues to the events of the immediate future, you just need to keep your eyes open.

The gravity which is essential to the form and enabling of the function of the metaphor is paralleled in reality as the passing of time. With time frozen the universe is completely still and stable. Unfrozen there is motion, interaction and change. No change can begin or settle without the passing of time.

From a human perspective, the sum of changes over long periods of time is progress. The forefront of progress is always pressed to the edge of time, but unlike time, progress is not linear, although it may appear to be when viewed over eons and from great distance. The path of progress is not circular either as was supposed in the past with less knowledge and narrower perspective.  The path of progress is best described as a corkscrew, easy to confuse for a line from afar or a circle from within.

TLDR;

Wu wei is passing time, the power behind change , and the guiding force of progress.  To fight against any advancement on any of these fronts is to fight against the metaphoric gravity. You will not stop it, you will not alter it, you will only drive yourself to insanity or exhaustion.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,1349480399.0,,,True,t3_10p1py,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/10p1py/wu_wei_and_its_river_metaphor_revised_more/,

This is something that I've wanted to discuss for a while, but never got the audience to talk to until now.

I personally am very in-touch with my feminine side, and admire, if not idolize, the female sex. Because of this, I tend to fall for more tomboyish/masculine women. But this made me think...In homosexual relationships, male or female, do Taoists still suggest a healthy masculine/feminine relationship, even with with yin or yang-only sexes involved?

I rarely lash out in anger the way I did as a confused adolescent boy. I see anger as a tool when properly honed.
However, a recent trip to the country to visit my girlfriends family resulted in not one, but two incidents of near blind rage on my part.
The first incident resulted from my overhearing that everyone in Iraq was a ""savage."" This resulted in a long, heated argument about the history of various religions and the implications of their teachings.
The second incident had to do with a conversation about unions. It's a bit involved to explain, but basically we had a long talk about how my dad's union cheated him out of his pension and about corruption that can worm its way into union work.
Both situations resulted in actual conversations and an exchange of ideas. However, I was brought to a point I can only describe as seeing red before I calmed myself back down quite quickly. 
My real question to you all out there is, how do you deal with anger? Do you still have outbursts of anger such as I had? What is it that causes you to get that way? 
I had quite a long period where I was very angry. Long enough that I almost began to enjoy it, but I pulled myself back onto the path.

1371337705.0,6,self.taoism,1gfacn,An anecdote from today,Salamosam,8,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1gfacn/an_anecdote_from_today/,"In order to attend a week-long conference on meditation, leadership, and group dynamics, I'm volunteering to help set up beforehand and tear down afterward. It's the [ALIA summer conference 2013](http://aliainstitute.org/summer2013/), in case anyone's interested, held at a university  in my city.

Yesterday I was asked to move some chairs around in the main hallway to create some nice sitting spaces, places where people can come and sit after listening to the speaker, relax, contemplate, and engage with other people in conversation. I went all out. Me and another volunteer spent 45 moving these chairs around. They are the modular, industrial type chairs you might see in a university lounge: low, comfortable together or separately, easy to move and place in an oddly-shaped environment. We arranged and rearranged the chairs, and created four different spaces of different sizes and imagined that everyone could be comfortable in one, regardless of their mood and level of sociability. I felt we put a lot of creative energy into this relatively straight forward task.

The very first chair I moved, I turned upside down. It was the first thought I had after being assigned the task. I put the back of a chair on the floor, such that if you were sitting in it in it's proper orientation, you would face the ceiling. You could still sort of sit on it regularly, especially if you were a toddler or kid. All the chairs had a five sided shape, so it sort of made an interesting thing to look at if you were sitting in the other chairs nearby. My intention, if I had one, was to create a conversation starter. Why was this chair upside down? I imagined that people who didn't know each other would look at it and make a joke, and then possibly start a conversation that wouldn't have started otherwise. I thought a focal point like an upside down chair would create a sense of play in an otherwise unplayful environment.

In fact before I left last night that is exactly what happened. Two guys from facilities management raised a few eyebrows at the chair, made a few jokes, and sat down across from each other with the upside down chair between them. One of them tinkled the keys of the piano next to him. I sat down in another nearby chair and created an equilateral triangle between us, and laughed at their jokes. Very quickly I felt like I was in a space of great potential. 

I talked with my roommate about the chairs and how it was an interesting creative project. I said it was interesting how one volunteer didn't get into it and was slow to move things around or offer suggestions, while another got right into it and was willing to experiment to create a great space.

When I came in today the chair was right side up. Other chairs nearby were spread out again and the sense of enclosed conversation space was gone. I vowed, good-naturedly, to return them to the way they were. I learned that they were moved by an authority figure to make sure that people could move through the space easily from one side to the other, and not be blocked by the formation of chairs. A fine motive, but not one that explained returning the challenging chair to it's mundane orientation.

I returned the chairs as best I could to the way they were set up yesterday, including the inversion. Shortly afterward, another volunteer suggested that I was creating some antagonism by directly undoing the work of the authority figure who wanted to increase the flow of people. I agreed wholeheartedly, but stuck to my guns. I believed the upside down chair did not block the flow, and that the authority figure returned it to it's normal position only because it made her uncomfortable, because it challenged her complacency.

Now I know the authority figure from another context, and we have a mutual respect for each other. Her role in the conference is an administrative one, and she has been working very hard, and continues to, to make this conference a success, to create new wisdom and spread it as far as she can, and to make the world a better place the best way she knows how. I agreed to talk with her about the upside down chair, to try to address her issues and also to offer my perspective. She had a few minutes to look at the chairs with me, and she agreed that the traffic flow was improved and no longer an issue, but that the upside down chair had to go. I asked her why but she was unable to provide an answer. She said she didn't have the ""bandwidth"" to deal with this kind of thing. I asked if I could present my case for the chair and she reluctantly agreed, but I was unable to convince her, so I turned the chair back to it's normal position.

We spent a few amiable minutes together moving a few other chairs around, and now it's a comfortable and welcoming sitting space. She then said that now she's probably a ""bitch that squashed your creativity,"" but I quickly tried to get rid of that thought. I said that I was here to help and that I'm not trying to make things difficult.

Returning to the other volunteers and my other tasks I felt deflated, like my creative self-expression was deemed invalid, and that an authority figure felt threatened by something as simple as a chair upside down and returned it to a position of conformity. The other volunteers, one of whom thought the space I created was ""fun"", and another who encouraged me to return the space to they way I wanted it, knowing that I got such a kick out of it, did not talk to me about the chairs. The matter was dropped like it never existed. My precious positive energy started to drain away quickly.

I'm still thinking about it, enough to write several paragraphs about it and post it to a bunch of strangers on the internet. I have a strong feeling of unsatisfactory resolution, and I will have a memory of this for a long time.",,False,,t5_2qhmd,False,,,True,t3_1gfacn,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1gfacn/an_anecdote_from_today/,

1371148783.0,3,self.taoism,1ga993,A brief essay on wu-wei.,chewingofthecud,6,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1ga993/a_brief_essay_on_wuwei/,"Wu-wei is one of those things that I've always known about intuitively, but it took getting in to Taoism before the full profundity of it hit me.  For Westerners, the closest thing we have to it is the phrase ""less is more"".  I'd like to look at wu-wei through the lens of a few things that we are all familiar with, and how it can be applied across many aspects of life.  In the spirit of wu-wei I will try to keep this as short as possible.

1)  **Wu-wei and creativity:**  As a musician, creativity is very important to me.  I can't explain where it comes from, or how to tap in to it, but I *can* tell you how to destroy creativity: over-think it.  I played guitar for about a decade before I wrote my first song that I was happy with, and in that time I tried to master the technique of playing, to become a ""skilled"" guitarist.  But I took this too far.  Instead of this technique helping me say what I wanted to say, I would always over-analyze and think too hard about the theory behind any idea I came up with, which would stop my momentum.  It wasn't until I stopped trying, and paid attention to that little voice inside (my ""muse"" for lack of a better word), that I began to create.  I don't write music now - I am a vessel through which music writes itself.  As a concrete example, I often wake up in the morning and have a tune stuck in my head.  In this semi-conscious state I always think it is a song that I heard on the radio or elsewhere, but when I get up and work out the tune on the guitar, it is almost always something brand new.  I can't make it happen, but what I can do is to be receptive to it when it does happen.

2)  **Wu-wei and civil disobedience:**  When you look at social movements, they happen because someone said ""no"" as often as they happen because someone said ""yes"".  It's easy to stop one person who is trying to accomplish something, but when a person says ""no"", when they refuse to participate, no amount of force in the world can make them do so, if their conviction is firm.  To change things through political action requires a lot of effort, often people must devote a whole lifetime to climbing the ranks and gaining influence - yet achieving things through political *inaction* can sometimes be the catalyst to turning things around instantly.  I'll give some examples... there are many.  The most obvious one is Rosa Parks; her refusal to move to the back of the bus during the era of civil rights strife in America was a turning point.  Why?  Because she said ""no"", because she'd had enough and no one could budge her.  Another, more modern example:  Mohamed Bouazizi was a street vendor from Tunisia who suffered humiliation and antagonism from corrupt local officials, to the extent that his life became unbearable.  In 2011, he killed himself by immolation.  While this sounds like an action, it is really a refusal to continue, an ""opting out"".  His very public suicide was arguably *the* flashpoint which ignited the Arab Spring.

3)  **Wu-wei and governance:**  Politics is a touchy issue.  I will not attempt to proselytize anyone in to adopting my own beliefs about government.  However the Tao Te Ching is undeniably political, being among other things a book of advice to the Sage-as-ruler.  And where you see this advice in the Tao Te Ching, it nearly always is in diminishing the role of government than otherwise.  Rather than spelling it out, I will simply suggest some reading with this in mind.  Look at chapters 17, 58, 59 and especially 57 and 75.

Icons, Ritual and Scripture in Contemplative Traditions: Part One: Can there be a Skillful Use of Iconic Symbols in Meditation practice?

What is meditation? There are many types of meditation; we will speak about non-conceptual meditation. Non-conceptual meditation (zuowang or zuochan) is roughly defined as a practice that uses the qi to find the Qi – or uses the mind to find the Mind – uses the de (shen) to find Dao. The method/process is generally directed “inward” (neidan, neigong) relative to our pattern of compulsive “doing and thinking”. 

How does compulsion arise and maintain itself? The view/assumption is that wisdom (reality) is found through a direct experience of our true nature; that apparently can be temporarily obscured by excessive and compulsive directing the qi/mind “outward” to create a false, dream-like or imaginary world that contains no true sense of satisfaction or comfort – no abiding sense of the real (Dao). In this case, we can say our relative condition is dual and our true or natural condition is non-dual, indefinable, unconditioned. 

When the practice of meditation is associated with or offered in the context of religion it comes with a set of symbols and icons – a set of teachings. These teachings, often beginning as iconoclastic (revolutionary, rebellious), inevitably take on the characteristics of history (time) and culture (socio-political norms) – and often “redefine” or transform conventional culture (customary use of symbols). These symbols eventually form a single “orthodoxy” – a standard set of symbols.

What is an icon – symbol? As infants (before speech) our perceptions are direct and perhaps quite plain. Firm definitions do not define our experience . 
We “learn” symbols as we learn language and much of this process is accompanied by praise and blame, approval and disapproval from our family/peers/school. We could then say that symbols are associated with and support the notion of dualism (self-other, them-us, me and a world). Ultimately whether we identify as an “insider” with conventional behaviors/symbols or an “outcast” with rebellious with idiomatic, anarchistic behavior/symbols, our “position” or point of view is always relative to a set of symbols (customs, language and relationships). In fact, we can imagine the symbols use us when they become a compulsive struggle for finding “meaning” and “value” outside our experience (salvation, committed “love”, material prosperity, etc.) .
The contemplative sense of awakening undermines the solid validity of symbols the practitioner may have established. Likewise meditation exposes the transparency of symbols while the eroding the notion of an abiding self. To avoid the extremes of nihilism (pre-occupation with emptiness or meaninglessness) and transcendence (excitement – spiritual materialism) we continue to relate to symbols but in what way? Symbols remain of interest as a means of expression rather than as a means of solid definition of experience. 

We use icon/symbols to define our own experience AND express it in our interactive relationships. The practice of meditation offers a personal experience that does not require effort per se. With the view that it is a “return” to our unchanging true nature there is a suggestion that we will be “liberating” our experience from the compulsive use of symbols. The experience of meditation itself defies definition (apophetic). But to abandon symbols/language/icons altogether is not possible – our relative condition is, in the end, a wonderful art project – a place to express our nature and, by so doing, complete our experience of wisdom – awakening. For this reason ancestral lineages of practitioners have left us a wealth of symbols and icons. If we view them as artwork we have a choice to become curators or artists. In the matter of Asian traditions being transmitted to the so-called West, there is problem of suitability and a chance to refresh the transmission. Those busy creating and sustaining spiritual materialism are not true artists. If we are burdened by exclusively curatorial motives or oppressive curatorial leaders the beauty is loss in the invitation to seeking wisdom and the tide of materialism goes on defining and redefining hope and fear – nothing else. 

There is a sense of maturation that arises in meditation practice that seeks completion in some sort of expression . When this occurs the icons/symbols of the transmission become our own – they are revealed, so to speak. If the revelation is complete the practitioner sees past the form into the basic or root of the symbol and is therefore able to “reform” it. 
This circle of revelation or expression is of supreme importance. As the practice finds a new home in the qi, hearts and minds of various practitioners (new countries, new generations) the opportunity to be innovative and/or creative will naturally override simple curatorship. As the Asian traditions mature in the qi hearts/minds of Western practitioners we will have the chance, indeed responsibility, to renew the language/symbols/icons of the tradition. 
Without fully maturing the practice of meditation we risk losing the momentum of our lineage ancestors and remaining incomplete. This incomplete quality leaves us with feelings of compromise, hopelessness and, even, self-hate. When the complete teaching and its fruition are not alive the practice of meditation will become nothing but an emotional sedative. 

Over the Dharma Assemblies of the next few months let’s look at icons, vestments, scripture and ritual with new eyes and ears – let’s find a way to cultivate freedom to completion and find creative outlet for our natural condition finding expression in this relative world! Honor the ancestors without lazily becoming mindless curators!

Most photographers probably haven't made a connection between their work and taoism, but the similarities in practice are very interesting. Thanks

enlighten the people,/
but rather to keep them in the dark./
The people are hard to govern because they know too much./
And so to rule a state with knowledge is to be a detriment to the state./
Not to rule a state through knowledge is to be a blessing to the state.""

She's married to Stephen Mitchell (yes, *that* Stephen Mitchell). Before meeting/marrying him, she went through her own spiritual transformation and ended up with ""The Work,"" which is what she calls the process of, basically, questioning our thoughts until we end up with ... I don't know ... basically a pure understanding of What Is.

It's been a very transformational process in my own life, and her beliefs are VERY ""Taoist"" in nature, though she does not identify as a Taoist and didn't know anything about Taoism before meeting Stephen.

ANYWAY, the specific book A Thousand Names for Joy was compiled by Stephen reading verses from the Tao Te Ching (most likely his translation, of course) and asking Katie what she thinks it means and how she lives that in her life. It's a pretty profound, and very not-mainstream way to understand and live life. But it is fascinating to read understandings of the Tao Te Ching from someone who is completely unblocked, uncluttered, and IN it.

I do believe that she's one of the only teachers (as it were) out there right now who is really mainlined into ""The Tao"" or ""reality"" or ""what is.""

I need a real real asian gods supplies store that sells online at reasonable prices.  I saw on ebay someone selling ""hell bank notes"" for $1 a note, when you can readily get them in the hundreds for a dollar.   Anyway, if anyone can help direct me to an online store it'd be greatly appreciated.

Shouldn't being with the Tao, in addition to being a peaceful mind, a go-with-the-flow mentality, ALSO be everything negative and hard-headed and aggressive?

Here's what I mean. The Tao is beyond descriptions, beyond concepts, and beyond ideas. This means there is as much Tao to be ""found"" in a forest as there is in an industrial wasteland. There's as much Tao ""in"" a river as there is in a heroin needle. All of man's creations are created by man, who are natural and with the Tao, and so therefore so are chemical plants, wars, genital mutilations, and donuts. They all ""are,"" and are therefore the Tao.

So - since aggression, pain, and all things negative are just as much Tao as their opposites (Tao is beyond such concepts as ""opposite"" and ""positive"" or ""negative"" anyway), what's to stop an angry, abusive, miserable person from declaring that they, too, are enlightened?

After all, no one said that being enlightened means you aren't a douche.

There is a concept in the Elder Scrolls called CHIM, and while it does not come up directly in any of the games it is possibly the most important thing that can happen to the characters.  Here I will provide a brief explanation of what it is.  

&gt;""To understand CHIM you must firstly understand that the whole of the Elder Scrolls universe is the dream of the Godhead, an unknown entity turned schizophrenic by the raging battle between the 'Order' of Anu and the 'Change' of Padomay. This 'dream' is subgradient which means that each level of the dream (Void to Aurbis to Mundus) are lesser parts of the dream. Therefore all the beings seen in the Elder Scrolls games are parts of the Godhead, as is the player character him/herself.
CHIM, is the realisation that you are a part of this Godhead whilst also being an individual within it. Failure to realise the second part leads to zero-summing, which is blanking out of the dream. It is called zero-summing because of the equation that is needed to attain CHIM. In order to attain CHIM you must balance the 'I AM' (of existence) and the 'I AM NOT' (of non-existence) and still conclude that 'I AM' or adding 1 and -1 and still getting 1. If you get 0, you zero-sum out of existence, which is not desired....

    Receding, it is described as far away,
    Being far away, it is described as turning back.

    Hence the way is great;
    Heaven is great;
    Earth is great;
    The king is also great.
    Within the realm there are four things that are great,

So I'm rather conflicted at the moment. I've been hanging out with and sleeping with this girl, and I quite enjoy our conversations, and I really enjoy the sex. I'm aware that I'm crushing pretty hard on her; she took my virginity and I had a crush on her before that happened. The ""beginning"", if you will, of the conflict I'm experiencing stems because I don't trust her. There are multiple reasons: she has a boyfriend who doesn't know about us, she's extremely closed and guarded, and she's quite intelligent and clearly knows how to manipulate people. As a side note, I'm not saying this because she's a woman; men can be just as manipulative.

Anywho, on top of this, many times I don't particularly enjoy her company. Generally, that happens when I really want to be having sex and we're doing something else or she's not in the mood, but sometimes we're just hanging out and I don't feel comfortable around her.

This leads me to have an internal struggle with myself with one voice saying I should just tell her I can't see her anymore, and the other saying I should wait and decide whether to hang out with her on a case by case basis.

And that is why I'm posting this story here. I can see both sides being in the Tao. I don't know if I'm letting fear of losing what might be keeping me from letting her go and granting myself peace of mind. I also don't know if that course of action is putting too much weight to the future.

I have a feeling that it's pride and lust keeping me from ending things, so I'm beginning to lean towards ending things.

TL;DR I don't know whether to tell someone that I can't have them in my life, or whether to just wait and make every decision completely in the moment.

&gt;My dear, I used to think I was serving humanity... and I pleasured in the thought. Then I discovered that humanity does not want to be served; on the contrary, it resents any attempt to serve it. So now I do what pleases [me].

**Chapter 22**  
*If you want to become whole,  
let yourself be partial.  
If you want to become straight,  
let yourself be crooked.  
If you want to become full,  
let yourself be empty.  
If you want to be reborn,  
let yourself die.  
If you want to be given everything,  
give everything up.*

&gt;The fact that he had broken his oath(1) more times than there were years intervening did not trouble him; his was not a small mind bothered by logic and consistency. Nor did the mere presence of two more pensioners sleeping under his roof and eating at his table bother him. Pinching pennies was not in him. **In the course of nearly a century of gusty living he had been broke many times, had several times been wealthier than he now was; he regarded both conditions as he did shifts in the weather, and never counted his change.**

(1)The oath was to not take more ""strays"" (people) into his house

**Chapter 12**  
*The Master observes the world  
but trusts his inner vision.  
He allows things to come and go.  
His heart is open as the sky.*

[After accidentally tying his shoes together and then falling over:]
&gt;I have learned only two ways to tie my shoes. One way is only good for lying down. The other way is good for walking. 

*The character, Mike, does not view things as having a ""right way"" and a ""wrong way"". Just different states of being which may be more suited to certain things.*

&gt;""Wait a minute, son. Don't give up so quickly. You simply haven't learned to laugh yet... and you'll never learn just by trying. But you will learn, I promise you. If you live among us long enough, one day you will see how funny we are - and you will laugh"" ""I will?"" ""You will. Don't worry about it and don't try to grok it; just let it come.""

*You can't ""understand"" (as much as we can ever understand it) the dao by chasing after it... understanding will come gradually, naturally and effortlessly.*

&gt;""Thou art God,"" Mike repeated serenely. ""That which groks. Anne is God. I am God. The happy grass are God, Jill groks in beauty always. Jill is God. All shaping and making and creating together-."" He croaked something in Martian and smiled.

**Chapter 25**  
*There was something formless and perfect  
before the universe was born.  
It is serene. Empty.  
Solitary. Unchanging.  
Infinite. Eternally present.  
It is the mother of the universe.  
For lack of a better name,  
I call it the Tao.*  
  
*It flows through all things,  
inside and outside, and returns  
to the origin of all things.*

I'm going through a really tough period in my life at the minute. I have a 6 year relationship going very steadily wrong and the people closest to me say I am changing from the happy, fun person I used to be to someone who constantly looks depressed, frustrated, stressed and angry.

I don't however feel like I have changed at all so this is very scary to me. Although I didn't really know myself before I now feel like I don't know anything about me and I am becoming everything I don't want to be without even realising.

I have recently started Tai Chi (1 lesson) and while I was doing it I truly felt a difference in how I felt about myself and my happiest in a long long time. 

As a result of this tai chi experience I'm wondering if I should have a small look at taoism to see if this can help me improve my life and how I feel and maybe combat this change I am going through and not hurt those around me.

Quote from the intro:
&gt;Ithkuil, on the other hand, views the world as being based on complementary principles, where, instead of discrete independence between related entities, such concepts are seen as complementary aspects of a single holistic entity. Such complementarity is in turn reflected in the derivation of word-roots. By “complementarity” is meant that the manifestation of a concept appears in any given context as either one sort of entity or another, but never both simultaneously; yet, neither manifestation can be considered to be a discrete whole without the existence of the other. A simple illustration of complementarity is the flip of a coin: the coin can only land on one side or the other, yet without both sides being part of the coin, any given coin toss has no meaning or contextual relevance no matter which side is face-up.

The best example I can think of is dukkha. Its so much more than ""suffering""

Anyway,

If wei and li are the same, what is a Chinese word for wuwei? 

If someone could take wei and li and translate them into Tao words, Chinese words and Sanskrit and talk about them for a bit I would be shocked but also wholly satisfied.

I guess what i'm wondering comes down to: li implies that the way of nature, what happens on its own, has a pattern, like the grain in wood. Does Wei imply a pattern? Or just chaos. And if all this stuff i'm taking about isn't way off, what is the relationship between wuwei and li?  Is wuwei no li? 

So the planets, they revolve around the sun without doing, so that's a good example of wuwei. But they have a pattern, which implies li. What i'm thinking of now is a sort of patterned chaos, which isn't wei, wuweI, li or nonli. There's chaos, when you roll the dice a different number will come up each time. but natural patterns do exist, like the grain in wood. Am I just hung up on perception? Lol. Maybe there are patterns, but within these patterns is chaos, not every tree is the same obviously, but this sorry if implies there's only chaos to a point and is really fatalistic and I don't believe in fatalism at all just for the fact that I can put hsuxiebsixofnrvsispxkxkckxowllls in this post.

(source: Liu Ming, see comments)",poekoelan,1,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/no64p/chinese_astrology_dec_23_2011_jan_3_2012_winter/,"Fri Dec 23 – 11/29 – Good day for funerals, human trafficking and child abuse. Keep a vigilant eye on your kids. Having said that – the inner world that may be full of wounds and regrets can be purged with outbursts of generosity and strict new disciplines. Try it, even if it often doesn’t “work” for you. Dharmapala offering day.

Sat Dec 24 – 11/30 – If you dared to look inward yesterday (and did a bit of house cleaning in your gnarly subconscious) a fresh start could be wonderful. If you are clinging to old patterns they may fall on you like a ton-o-bricks. Emergency medical centers will be busy and your blind habits may, in fact, actually make blind you today. Withdrawal is the best bet.

Sun Dec 25 – 12/1 – First day of the Metal Ox Moon. Yeah, I know, it’s Christmas day. So if you are with family it can go well if you just sit and watch – do not announce your gender reassignment plans to Aunt Agatha – it might kill her. Qi lurching or running off at the mouth will be tempting but bring on catastrophe – stuff it! If you’re doing belated rainbow solstice with LGBT friends don’t push the happiness – be home by 10pm. 

Mon Dec 26 – 12/2 – If you are keeping the precepts of jie qi – following the mandates of the Chinese calendar, today is splendid. A splendid day in the dead of winter however can be best enjoyed by simply signing in for the results of the always-so. There should be big sales to go to, getting back to work proves successful and enjoying the company of friends is rich. Watching a DVD you got for Xmas is suitable entertainment. If you have wasted energy w modern solar winter “holidays” the day provides no respite – you will get even more tired. 

Tue Dec 27 – 12/3 – Today is much like yesterday. Still tired from overdoing it? Consult the Oracle. Travel and talking too much will drain you dry. Let someone help. Get a very modest medical treatment but not a colonic. Fire Dragon day indicator could provide dangerous lurches (thinking you have enough energy to be vigorous and daring) – actions w/out thought. Don’t take any dares. There is risk of suddenly exhausting the new-year yang that has barely sprouted. 

Wed Dec 28 – 12/4 – Those in “tune” with jie qi will have another very nice day. Long-range plans will deliver some long awaited fruition. The day has an unusually smooth qi. The elements and animals (Stem/Branches) line up very well. Consult the ancestors for visions of the Lunar New Year. Learn from Jim Kelly’s fate in Enter the Dragon when he over-stated: “I will be too busy looking good, Mr Han-man!” Good day to get your car serviced, hair cut and do some planning, but don’t over-estimate your cool!

Thu Dec 29 – 12/5 – Goodness and gentleness pay off. The day is full of new starts that are solid and have been well-planned. It’s easy to find your place in the pack/team/posse – it’s good to work w others. Starting a journey or going back to school goes well especially when you head southeast (go w modesty and freshness).

Fri Dec 30 – 12/6 – Misconduct will put you in the crosshairs of the assassin. You will be visited by ominous apparently unjust retribution. Whatever you do, keep your mouth shut – no arguing, no gossiping (even you) and stay away from hospitals, cemeteries and the Tenderloin. Genetic predispositions for death (dying like your parents did) have the advantage today. According to the Tibetan calendar 9 BAD omens collide today (from 5:30pm to 7pm tomorrow) – the Chinese calendar generally concurs. Building today will bring calamity to the family. Arguments will destroy your reputation. Harmless bad habits turn into raging addictions and chronic diseases. If you can, stay home under the covers and think good thoughts. Eat vegetarian food. Think last chance for the haunting ancestors to harm you.

Sat Dec 31 – 12/7 – Not outa the dark yet – eat veggies. Though nine GOOD omens start this evening – wait for it – the sweet good qi will arrive like a gentle breeze around 7pm. Cuddle up w your number one and spoon quietly into the night. Dreams should be awesome. Think the haunting ones are heading back to hell – you did your best. They will take their auto-accident score and go down. Before you sleep make a sincere pledge to be a better person in 2012. 

Sun Jan 1 – 12/8 – The nine GOOD omens rule until 9pm! Happy New Year! Ya, ya I know the Chinese calendar is Lunar, but the 8th day of the 12th moon is a La Festival that predates the current traditional Chinese calendar (2012 is 4710). The day could not have better omen for the New Year! Community altars may open with Rites designed to support (new) leaders. It is an excellent day to open your heart and support all the strange and wonderful worldwide revolutions of the Metal Rabbit year. Put your money where your mouth is. Give peace a chance. Make a plan to work positively in the recalibration that will come w the Water Dragon year. Solidify your convictions and plan to make a better world - then do it! Forget the “enemy”, stop analyzing the “conflict” and change the world by your own positive actions! Taking a dose of tonic herbs might help. 

Mon Jan 2 – 12/9 – Ok calm down. Avoid divination, unless you know an insightful sooth-sayer. Let the remnants of your 2011 conflicts depart. Long distance travel is auspicious. Let things happen of themselves. Dig down and unearth the roots of your belligerent selfishness. Start cleaning the house for New Year. If you have moved house in the last few months – do not neglect the settling in process; unpack, edit and pretty up your new place. You won’t find much at the sales. 

Tue Jan 3 – 12/10 – Use the day to commit to your New Year’s resolutions. Back-peddle. Go home if you have been traveling. The tsok (offering) for Guru Rinpoche today is directed to Dorje Drolo (his wrathful emanation). It serves as a reminder to use the sharp edge of your belligerence to cut out the very heart of your belligerence. Never mind trying to be perfect just enlist your imperfections in the Great Enterprise – beyond good and bad! Deep below the thick ice a mini-dragon (secret yang) is stirring.

For example looking at the lyrics to ""Damn it Feels Good to be a Gangsta"" by the Geto Boys

""A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right 
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin mouth 
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights"" 

Seems to follow the Taoist philosophy to a t. The sage would not wish to contend (or start fights) much less talk much of their own philosophy or virtues (run his fucking mouth). They would play their 'cards right' in accordance with the tao. 

""And niggas always gotta high cap 
Showin' all his boys how he shot em 
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts 
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em 
And everythings cool in the mind of a gangsta"" 

Less sage like persons brag about their endeavors (high cap, showing their boys how they shot him) but the sage would not brag of previous victories because they know themselves and thats enough. As in the Tao of Kung Fu when the monk takes on the swordsmen blind and the master asks him who he was proving it to ""himself or these pupils?"" and continues with ""Is it not better know oneself truly then to impress others?"" (not the exact quote.) The mind of the Sage is truly 'cool' as well.

The rest of the song does not quite lend itself quite as well to the ideals of Taoism but these first lines do express a 'gangsta' with the mind of a sage.

Open, round, immeasurable., it is boundlessly vast. Covering everything, containing everything, it produces myriad beings without presuming on its virtue, it bestows blessings on myriad beings without expectation of reward. Whether people are respectful or insincere, supportive or antagonistic, is left up to them. Whether people are good or bad, attractive or repulsive, and whether creatures are violent and stubborn or docile and obedient, they are allowed to be so of themselves, without any contrivance. The earth is very thick. Lowly, below all else, it bears everything and nurtures all beings. It can bear even the weight of the great mountains, and it can endure even the erosive force of great waters. It tolerates being pierced by plants and trees, and it submits to the tread of birds and beasts. It does not mind being cheapened by pollution. What I realize as I observe this is the Tao of emulating heaven and earth. If people can be open-minded and magnanimous, be receptive to all, take pity on the old and the poor, assist those in peril and rescue those in trouble, give of themselves without seeking reward, never bear grudges, look upon others and self impartially, realize all as one, then people can be companions of heaven. If people can be flexible and yielding, humble with self-control, entirely free of agitation, cleared of all volatility, not angered by criticism, ignoring insult, docilely accepting all hardships, illnesses, and natural disasters, utterly without anxiety or resentment when faced with danger or adversity, then people can be companions of earth.

Watch out I'm philosophical and sharey today!

So, maybe it's all a matter of perspective -- life, that is. That transgression, perceived or real, that happened to you; would the world stop turning if you just let it go?

That's not to say that there aren't important matters, but try to constantly challenge your beliefs and see how those issues matter in perspective to the rest of the world, the rest of the universe.

Once perspective is achieved then we can begin to take our egos out of the equation. If I die tomorrow does that mean the universe stops working? Does that mean that the world stops turning? Does that mean that someone across town breaks their daily routine? No. Am I important? Ultimately, no, but to a few people -- myself included -- the answer is ""Yes"".

Once perspective is achieved and ego is removed then we can see the world for what it is. What is the world? It doesn't matter. Again, ""perspective"".

Good things and bad things happen. How do we appreciate the good times without the bad times? Would they feel as good? What is good and bad, but shades of each other? Again, ""perspective"".

We can know the bad parts, and even appreciate them, but try to keep to the good parts. Embrace the darkness and light together.

I am a huge admirer of Carl Jung and just recently I tried the coin method of I Ching... And the hexagram talked about what was happening lately in my life

I also always admired yin yang since I came to know it, much by the fact that it can be used to understand physics in a easier way.

So, here's my question: is the yin and yang (the tao?) able to be used to understand better what's happening in romantic relationships? What's happening between the two souls?

I can only imagine there are phases of more 'outer' expression and phases of more 'inner' thought, but I would like to expand that view of mine, like how yin and yang can not only be used to explain the phases of matter, but also the seasons of the year.

One guard, a tricky guy, moments before the cage was locked, tossed to them an apple and a deck of cards. ""Have fun, but be careful with that apple, it looked a little dangerous"".

The three men take his advice, and each in turn, and sometimes together, they set about playing with the deck of cards, each in humble contentment.

Soon the Resentment Machine kicks in, as each man grows bored with the cards. Typically when this happened they would sleep for a while, and when they woke their passion for cards was renewed again.
But this time there is a silent understanding between the men. Cards are no longer enough, let us now taste the apple we were given. Each man bites it, and though they do not yet know it they have become the three Vinegar Tasters. And for them rest is never enough to silence their Resentment Machine, ever after, for the have felt the Will to Power. Now, bearers of logic they are, they no longer pass the cards around freely, but instead each man takes 1/3 the deck, to be His and His alone.

The first man, Buddha and Schopenhauer, idly passes through the cards a few times before declaring it a game for children, amusing enough but ultimately best put out of mind. He renounces his Will to Life, and he sits in the corner, content.

The second man, Confucius and Christ, looks through the shuffled deck and finds the disorder hateful. He sets about sorting the cards exactly as he considers best. Once his project complete, he gazes peacefully at his creation, content with the creation of his Will to Power.

The third man, Laozi and Nietzsche, shuffle the deck endlessly, marveling at the patterns that emerge by chance. Thus he whiles away eternity, merging his Will to Power and Will to Life with that of the cards.

And so the men sit, for 5000 years of card play. When suddenly a wizard teleports into the room, startling all 4 men quite a lot.
""Oh, cards! I love cards"" the Wizard says, holding out his hand. Though the three men are fearful to hand over their cards so easily, the bold confidence of the Wizard intrigues them, and they do.

""Behold, a trick!"" The Wizard shuffles with skill, cards falling and passing in complex patterns that only make glimpses of sense from without. The three men look on, and the wizard brings his trick to an end and pulls from the deck a Key.

With the key the wizard unlocks the cage, and walks out. The three men hesitate briefly, but soon follow him out.

So I was drunk and had been recently practicing some neikung.

I was walking down the street and yelled at a car, in quebecois « t’étais ben mieux » which means something like « a good thing I didn’t caught you doing that » and then a guy just came out of behind the car, as if hidden and afraid of me…

I started feeling really agressive, as if I had just escaped someone trying to mug me and I cannot really explain what happened but it’s like a deep down rage just came out… My fists went really tensed and I started walking really agressively, as if in a battlefield…

Then I started hitting everything, car mirrors, bus signs, publicities until I started feeling really dangerous, nothing seemed to hurt me (yes I was drunk but after all that I will tell you, I just have a little scratch on my left arm and two very little bruising on my right hand) and then at one point, I just remembered that all this strength was because of the meditation I had done, accumulating some yin and yang as I had studied and that I was projecting and absorbing energy through my centers…

So I just spontaneously decided, as a drunk guy can be spontaneous, to do it consciously and when I hit the next car, the whole passenger side just blew into pieces, I couldn’t believe what had happened, I just started walking faster, fleeing the « crime » scene, looked at my hand but couldn’t see any bruising, didn’t felt any pain, yet so much of the car had gone to pieces, it looked like a hammer pierced through it many times…

For the first time in my life, I felt like I had destroyed something not with my physical body, but with energy, I was excited, ego proud, yet at the same time, afraid of what I could do, seeing that I was kinda out of control…

I’ve been meditating ever since and feeling ups and downs regarding this ego proudness and amazment to the manipulation of energy… I guess I should say that I have already healed people through what looks like Reiki (altough I just did it from my own personal non traditional point of view), and so can see, at least theoretically, the passage of energy from me to someone else, as something possible. I guess, right now, through writing it, I somehow realize that I just never thought that I could use it to destroy as well…

Anyhow, it just feels really weird, I hope I’m not becoming a Sith Lord hehe but I know it’s probably just something I had to realize, to understand, and that, yes, I could accumulate this energy, but that I had to do it with some respect… Good thing it was just a car and not a human, I guess…

EDIT: after a private exchange, I wanted to clarify one simple thing: when I yelled at the car, which started the whole thing, the guy who came hidden, exactly from where I was pointing, looked like a guy who was hiding because he wanted to rob me, and that I had intuitively felt him and yelled at him before he attacked me.... I thought it was obvious so I didn't explained more, but that's what made me mad, but at the same time, I felt very confident, because I guessed where he was (and his intentions, I guess) and that's where anger start getting uncontrollable, I felt I could feel things and that this guy had no chance with me because I could predict his motion, etc., and a bit like Hulk loosing control, the rage just got a strong vibe over me until I just exploded with fury and started feeling invincible until the moment I totally exploded and realized the damage all this destructive energy had... on the car...",,False,,t5_2qhmd,True,,,True,t3_s1ioc,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/s1ioc/so_i_destroyed_a_few_cars/,

Chuang Tzu sums up my first issue:

&gt; *As I look at the matter, the first principles of benevolence and rightousness and the paths of approval and disapproval are inextricably mixed and confused together:-- how is it possible that I should know how to discriminate among them?'*

CT, II, 7

And it's true, even when it seems obvious a post is good or bad, that there's a whole lot more going on and my judgment of it can only be an expression of ignorance. The praying mantis waving its arms to stop the carriage.

At the same time, can we turn to Taoist wisdom and find some guide to action? There're a lot of stories in CT whose essential message seems to be ""Let what happens happen, *wu wei*""; there're a number of quotes in the Tao Te Ching that say the same thing:

&gt; *The sages are impartial*

&gt; *They regard people as straw dogs*

TTC, I, 5

&gt; *Therefore the sage says:*

&gt; *I take unattached action, and the people transform themselves*

&gt; *I prefer quiet, and the people right themselves*

&gt; *I do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves*

&gt; *I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves*

TTC, II, 57

So regards up/downvoting, it seems the approach they advise taking is to abstain from them altogether.

But then there're some other passages that suggest something different:

&gt; *Act without action*

&gt; *Manage without meddling*

&gt; *Taste without tasting*

&gt; *Great, small, many, few*

&gt; *Respond to hatred with virtue*

TTC, II, 63

&gt; *The one who meddles will fail*

&gt; *The one who grasps will lose*

&gt; *Therefore, sages do not meddle and thus do not fail*

&gt; *They do not grasp and thus do not lose*

TTC, II, 64

There's an emphasis there on action-as-meddling. I read it as, if you're trying to achieve a particular end, well you shouldn't act at all. So (and this is something that comes up in Chuang Tzu as well) (I'm quoting that less because the lessons come from the stories as a whole and they'd be too long to include here) if you just want to upvote/downvote something, do it. If it comes naturally, let it. But if you're doing it for some further end - trying to highlight agreement or admonish disagreement, trying to advance some cause or thwart another - then don't act.

The second quote I gave from the TTC agrees with that: it's not ""I take *no* action"" but ""I take unattached action"". So upvote/downvote away as you wish, but don't do it for some further purpose.

But then...some more possibilities:

&gt; *Sages do not accumulate*

&gt; *The more they assist others, the more they possess*

&gt; *The more they give to others, the more they gain*

&gt; *The Tao of heaven*

&gt; *Benefits and does not harm*

&gt; *The Tao of sages*

&gt; *Assists and does not contend*

TTC, II, 81

&gt; *The sages have no constant mind*

&gt; *They take the mind of the people as their mind*

&gt; *Those who are good, I am good to them*

&gt; *Those who are not good, I am also good to them*

&gt; *Thus the virtue of goodness*

TTC, II, 49

Those passages say to me, not to upvote/downvote based on your personal feelings but to attend to others solely. Upvote not because you want to upvote; upvote because the person you're upvoting will be gladdened by it. (And I think, pretty strongly it's suggested that you shouldn't downvote: even people who ""are not good"", you should be good to them).

This is another quote that could relate to downvoting:

&gt; *The highest goodness resembles water*

&gt; *Water greatly benefits myriad things without contention*

&gt; *It stays in places that people dislike*

&gt; *Therefore it is similar to the Tao*

TTC, I, 8

To me that makes it pretty clear that downvoting is not cool. Even the disliked should be accepted. And downvoting does seem harder to separate from meddling, from wanting to affect consequences - something which goes strongly against Taoist principles.

At this point though I was wondering, would the Taoist upvote everything then? And that seems like a lot of effort, so surely not. But then on what basis would they upvote only select things and *not* everything?

And then I found the following passages:

&gt; *Favor and disgrace make one fearful*

&gt; *The greatest misfortune is the self*

&gt; *What does ""favor and disgrace make one fearful"" mean?*

&gt; *Favor is high; disgrace is low*

&gt; *Having it makes one fearful*

&gt; *Losing it makes one fearful*

TTC, 1, 13


&gt; *Do not glorify the achievers*

&gt; *So the people will not squabble*

TTC, I, 3

Now that kinda suggests the whole reddit system is contrary to Taoist principles. And really, that's probably true. But it also brings us back to the first position, that maybe the right thing to do is to abstain from up/downvoting altogether. (Maybe really the right thing to do is not be on reddit at all).

So anyway. I don't know, I'm just playing around with this stuff. But do you up/downvote certain things? Or not at all? And why? And does Taoism come into it for you?",,False,,t5_2qhmd,1360423399.0,,,True,t3_186zz7,http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/186zz7/updownvoting_and_taoism/,
