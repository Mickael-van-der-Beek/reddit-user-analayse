Across from me is a church, and earlier I see two teenaged boys together on a quad (ATV) riding up on the lawn of the church.  They start spinning around, shredding the grass.  Then they start ""jumping"" the logs that are laid down to mark parking spots.  These huge logs are flailing about, banging on the ground.  360's in the parking lot, gravel flying everywhere.  They seemed to be escalating, so I called the police.  Long story short, the cops take too long to get there, the guys are gone, but the cops see the damage.  Right after they pull away?  Little bastard comes out from behind the church!  They did some more stuff, eventually left.  Police must have found them, though.  45 minutes later, I see the kids walking with some older man (Dad?), and they walk to the church.  Older guy starts directing them where to put the logs back, etc.  spent about ten minutes fixing things, then he stood there and lectured them in the parking lot for another ten.  Eventually they begin to walk back down the street.  Just when I thought it was all, done, SMACK!  Dad smacks both the boys in the back of the head while walking down the street.  Made me chuckle.  :)

** UPDATE**. Just had a call from the police to tell me that they caught the two hellions.  Small town, remember....the cop told me he had seen them earlier bootin' around town, and it turns out the one boy, owner of the quad, lives just down the street from the cop.  So he pulled in alongside the boy's house, and waited.  Sure enough, little bugger comes whipping in, and lands right in front of the cop.  What makes this even sillier is 1) This same boy almost lost his life last summer in a quadding accident, had to be air-lifted out, the town came together did fundraising, etc. and 2) This little shit is the brother of my daughter's best friend!  Gotta love a small town. :)

I own a townhouse in an urban area of Portland, Oregon. The street I live on is basically a sardine can of townhouses, one after another on both sides for several blocks. Each townhouse has a single-car driveway and a small front lawn. 

My street has a ""gang"" of children. There are around 10 of them, plus or minus 5 depending on the time of day, that just hang out on the street. They never go anywhere. They run around and ride bikes/skateboards in the street and in everyone's driveways. The trample all of the lawns, which are all dead due to the heavy foot traffic. The climb on the trees and break off branches. They go through everyone's trash and recycling and use whatever they find to make ramps and other makeshift garbage toys. They yell and scream all day and all night. They ignore cars that drive up and down the road, causing people to honk their car horns all day and all night. They knock on my door every other day trying to sell me rocks or candy. 

It's a nightmare. I've gone to their parents' house and tried to ask them to help curb the insensate noise, soliciting, theft and destruction of property, and I've basically been told to go fuck myself and mind my own business. One of the fathers threatened to call the police if I ever spoke to his child, even if he was on my property. I don't even think all of them live on my street, this is just their hangout spot. The group of kids is growing, and as they get older, it's getting worse. 

Is there anything I can do? I would love to just move away, but I'm not financially ready to sell the townhouse and buy another. Any suggestions are much appreciated. 

**Edit after reading comments:**

Thank you to everyone for the great advice. I've been reading all of the comments and have decided to talk with the local police about my best options. to answer some common questions/suggestions I've seen:

* I've lived at this location for about five years, and the kids have been a growing problem for the past two-ish years. Up to this point, I've put forth every effort to be friendly. I've had friendly conversation with them from time to time and they seem to have no ill-will towards me specifically. I've not been mean, but less friendly, since the unwanted soliciting began. The ""no soliciting"" sign has not helped, not that I really thought it would. 
* I live in a lower-income area of town because I decided to buy a house instead of wasting my money renting. When I purchased the house, I wasn't necessarily financially ready for the burden of a mortgage, and the bills do put me outside my means (basically 90% of my income is dedicated to bills on auto-pay). This being said, I don't have spare income for any high-tech solutions. I really do like the idea of the high-pitched anti-loitering speaker system and the automated motion-activated sprinklers (although, as pointed out already, our standard sprinkler system in Portland is the sky). 
*  The ""yard"" is a bit too small for a fence, and it's connected to the neighbors. [This is not my house, but here is picture of a similar townhouse layout](http://i.imgur.com/lnKgYdX.jpg) for reference. The biggest difference is that there are trees in the shared grass areas. 
* Another concern is my car. I use the garage for storage and park outside (as does everyone on my street), and I'm sure the kids have hit my car with balls/bikes/fistsofrage before. Car alarms go off regularly on my street, so I know they hit cars sometimes.

I'm a smoker now, and I always stand like 30-40 feet away from any non-smokers if I'm ever at a social gathering.  That would have been inconceivable 20 year ago.

Along the way, I picked up all sorts of informational confetti. General knowledge became my speciality.

My butterfly-mindedness had a consequence; I knew stuff. When a question came up in school, in an office, in a circle of friends, I became the bloke who people asked; 'how do you spell ......?', 'what's the capital of ...... ?', 'how does ..... work?', 'what does ..... mean?' - and, most of the time, with a little bullshit here and there, i had answers - as long as I kept quiet when a real expert was in the room.

But, over the last ten or so years, the questions have dried up somewhat. People no longer ask the bloke that knows stuff; they ask Google, they ask Wikipedia.

Below are the tasks associated with each stage of adulthood according to Robert Havighurst, an educator on aging. Please read them and reflect on your own life during the ages associated with each stage. Please describe how you felt you have adjusted or not adjusted to these tasks. Some tasks may not apply. Share as much or as little detail as you feel comfortable. Whatever you say will only be shared with my professor and then deleted. Your name will not be used. You may either answer below or send me your answers in a PM. Thank you very much for your participation!

Early adulthood (24-34): *Selecting a mate *Learning to live with mate *Starting a family *Rearing children *Managing a home *Getting started in an occupation *Taking on civic responsibility *Finding a congenial social group

Middle adulthood (35-60): *Achieving adult civic and social responsibility *Establishing and maintaining an economic standard of living *Developing adult leisure time activities *Assisting teenage children in becoming responsible adults *Adjusting to physiological changes *Adjusting to aging parents

Late adulthood (61 and up): *Adjusting to decreasing physical strength *Adjusting to retirement and decreased income *Adjusting to death of spouse *Establishing an explicit affiliation with one’s age group *Meeting social and civic obligations *Establishing satisfactory physical living arrangements",,False,self,t5_2sh93,False,,,True,t3_1b2630,http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1b2630/anyone_65_and_up_who_wants_to_help_me_with_an/,

This is generally a no-frills community, but after chatting with an /r/RedditForGrownups  member, we thought that ""user flair"" could be a useful addition to our experience.

I've opened up user flair to community control so you can add it if you'd like, or not of course.  The things we talked about doing include using our age or year of birth as flair (for the brave ones) or even your generation nickname.  Or if you're like me you could just add a piece about how old you feel... 

Please, get creative if you'd like, as I don't think I have to set any restrictions or rules about this kinda stuff in our sub.  And if things start to get odd or distracting we can certainly decide to reverse course on this in the future.  No big deal.

To set up yours it is simple:

 - You should see your username on the right bar not far under the subreddit title
 - Click the ""edit"" button next to your name
 - And edit away!

Let me know if you guys think this is a good/bad idea, as I'm always open to opinions on stuff like this.

*EDIT*: And while you're here, I just wanted to mention that the spam collector, while improving, is still pretty finicky, so you'll see a couple posts that are 3+ days old if you look down a few spots on our home page.  So if you submit something (that isn't spam) and you don't see it post right away just let me know and I'll be sure to save it from the spam bin ASAP.

Someone from /r/askreddit suggested I post this here, I guess I'll just jump right in, use some of what I wrote in my original post and elaborate a bit more, I'll try not to make it too long. I know this is Reddit and not therapy, so you can just completely skip it if you wish, no hard feelings.

Recently I've realized my being a slacker at work really might be holding me back, I've never really been what one considered lazy, but when I used to be one of the harder workers at my job I would go almost unnoticed and then talked down to and looked upon like I was barely even there. That's not to say I'm completely lazy now, I run the area I work in practically by myself and do everything the manager of the area should be doing plus more, but again it basically goes completely unnoticed. Saying something about it won't do much good, I've tried it more than I can remember and well I'm sure you all know how it goes, nowhere. I know if I left the place they would be screwed (doesn't everyone say that tho?), but I'm not exactly where I could go that would be any better.

I've more than started to realize that I've wasted some good years of my life at my job and I'm completely terrified, because (again) I honestly don't know where to go, what to do and I have nobody around that can guide me and give me some solid advice. I can't really rely on my friends for advice, not that they're bad (honestly, I'm lucky to have them), but some are in a similar situation, or have way too much going on for me to bother them. Sure there's my family, but I always get the same thing said to me, one of which I should move up in the company and it should be ""easy"" since I've been ""loyal and working there for years"", but that's unlikely to ever happen. I remember talking to a Manager that I'm on more than good terms with about the status of the store and it lead into me being getting in a higher position, she said that in her honest opinion she wouldn't trust me with running an area and training other people, which is absolutely blasphemous since I've trained more than my share of people over the years (most of which stayed with the company for years, 4 or 5 who currently still are), so right there I feel I have a good track record. She's also appointed me to take over of the area I'm currently in several times (naturally, minus the title, but all of the responsibility) because the person running it had gotten demoted and the other person that took over literally had no idea what she was doing, even when given very detailed notes and had her hand held the entire time. 

That's also something that really gets to me, not matter what I do, I know I'll be looked at there like I'm nothing. I guess maybe it's my own fault? I can have a rather laid back look and I can get most things done pretty easily (maybe too easy), but I hardly see how that's something I can change. I am able to work under pressure most of the time and maybe take too much crap from the people I work with (including other associates and Management), but again that's really something I don't think I can change and (again) saying something about it won't do a damn thing anyway. Who knows, maybe the manager was right, I'm completely delusional and really just a terrible worker.

I feel alone and I'm miserable, only thing I can do is move forward, I only wish I could see in front of me. I guess what I'm trying to say is I really need some outside advice, I know I'm the only one who can make myself change things and maybe I should just man up, but hearing some words from people with real life experience is something I really need right now.

Again, sorry if this came off as a childish rant and if it went on entirely too long. And again, please just move on if there's nothing to say.

TL;DR I am terrified of life right now, have no idea what to do and really need some advice from people who know better.

edit: Wow, this got a bigger response than I expected. I just want to thank everyone who gave their input, there's some very solid advice here and hopefully others like me will see it and get something out of it as well. I have a lot to think about and I'll try and post an update a couple of months from now.

I can't help but think to myself if they only knew how much being an adult actually sucks. The responsibility.. The money management.. The children of my own running around the house.. what I would give to be a child again free from responsibilities I mean what a life i had.. Sometimes I try to explain to them that being an adult is not all it's cracked up to be.. the general response normally similar to something like ""yeah right""..

After living in our house for coming up on 12 years now I'm finally able to give my wife her new kitchen.  Over the years we've done everything but kitchens and bathrooms - roof, windows, furnace, floors, etc etc etc... - but the kitchen has always been the big issue and now it looks like it can finally happen.

That is, if we don't kill each other.  To my wife, I'm penny pinching every decision and, now that we've *got* a kitchen fund, I'm doing everything I can not to spend it.  To me, my wife doesn't like to hear anything other than ""I want what I want and don't tell me I can't have it"" and even when she knows a contractor's allowance for certain materials she'll go off shopping and pick what she likes without ever even asking the price.

I know both sides of that make us sound awful, and in fairness it's not that bad - I'm not asking her to settle for bottom of the barrel stuff and she's not looking for gold plated stuff either.  But if the budget for something was $5000, I'm the one saying ""Hey here's something for $3500"" and she's the one saying ""I like this one for $6000.""

So, somebody that's gone through this, tell me it gets easier?  Tell me that yes, while it looks overwhelming now, it's actually going to all work out and that we're both going to be happy when it's over? I'm begging ya :).

Here's a more specific question to work with - how do you budget the project?  I have a max number in my head, that allows for a certain percentage over, that will still allow us to comfortably afford the project.  My wife feels that, after all these years of waiting for a kitchen, that I am deliberately holding back money and preventing her from getting what she wants, and that the very idea of having a maximum number takes all the fun out of it.  She knows how much money we have in total and knows that you don't just go spend all of it - but she refuses to agree to a smaller number.


Context - I'm 43, she's 40, we've got 3 small kids and a dog. We both work (me full time, her part time) so there's already enough normal every day stress to go around.  What can we do to get some fun back into the project?

I hope everyone is pleased with the direction of our little community, because so far I know I am.  The quality of the comments has been exactly what we were hoping for, and the posts have been great.  But if there is one thing I would like us to strive for it is only this: more of the same.

And by more I speak of quantity.  I know there are more like us out there in the vastness of Reddit, and I'd like them to be able to join us here.  Not only would that mean more quality posts for us to talk about, it would mean more quality people involved in our discussions.  

Getting the word out isn't particularly tough, it's just a matter of remembering we're here!  So when you see that comment about being confused/frustrated/annoyed about how things aren't how they used to be, just send them our way.  Or when you come across that post complaining about kids these days, that you just know Redditors of our ilk are going to read, just remember to post a link that would guide fellow grownups our way.  Hopefully soon we can can have lots to talk about every day, and lots of people to talk about it with!

Now with the part about how we should shamelessly plug our community out of the way, is there anything you guys *aren't* happy with?  Is there anything you'd like to see us do that we aren't yet doing?  And please, feel free to leave positive comments as well so we can continue to do things that you think are right!

And lastly, remember that on this site upvotes speak volumes.  As silly as it sounds, it is those votes that give us a simple way to validate and encourage each other.  So if you read a comment that you like, upvote it!  And if the post you just read was interesting, do the same.  These votes will keep people posting, and it will let your fellow grownups know that their comments aren't falling upon deaf ears.  It's that polite nod that we give in conversations that we cant do within the threads of RFG.

So we are looking into options for where and what to do with her.

Just recently she stopped driving and is stuck at home unless either myself, wife, or sister take her out.

* Looking at assisted living medicaid requires all assets to be liquified which sucks. She has great medical insurance (retired from a huge weapons design corporation), social security, pension, home paid off, IRA's and savings.
* Nice places cost 5-10K a month.

Thank you for joining, now please read this post to see how you could help us grow into a not so little community!",MrRabbit,24,10,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/h6y1o/hey_everybody_thank_you_for_joining_now_please/,"It's pretty easy actually. 

Just start posting whatever interesting links, thoughts, pictures, videos, ect. that you think this community of grownups would enjoy discussing.  And for that matter, start discussing!  If you see something interesting posted by a fellow grownup and you find it interesting, scary, thought provoking, or inspiring then make sure you let them know why.

Let's try to keep this community active as an oasis from the front page antics that brought us here in the first place.

Lastly, like any community, we want to grow.  But I really don't want to spam our name out there like many other subs do.  So if you have a good discussion with a fellow Redditor and you think they would like to join our little sub, then please invite them to contribute!  And if you see one of those posts that are just *screaming* ""Get off my lawn!'"" then just tell the OP and anyone who agrees that we decided that rather than complain about it, we just decided to make our own little community!

So go ahead! Post whatever you want! We have no topical guidelines here.  It will just be nice to know that when you get into a discussion with someone in our community that you won't be punned into oblivion, and that you are talking to another interested adult.

- The average age of the participants was over 40.

- The fastest average times were in the 35-40 bracket, followed by 30-35, THEN 25-30!

- This sport is very expensive!

So I was wondering if there were any other folks out there swimming/biking/running with me, and how you fit your training into your different lifestyles?

I love it, and the thought of the next race has been my best motivation for exercising that I have found yet.  But why do you guys think it skews older as it does?  I have a couple theories, but I'll post them as a comment rather than cluttering things up here with my crazy ideas.

And for those of you who might want to try it out, I just read this GREAT article over in /r/triathlon.  It captures the essence of the whole thing perfectly:

1364413744.0,3,self.RedditForGrownups,1b4obr,"Grownups of Reddit, Is not planning to get married and planning to work for love instead of money a good idea?",snuV,5,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1b4obr/grownups_of_reddit_is_not_planning_to_get_married/,"About marriage: 

I (think) I understand the importance of having kids. I wouldn't be here if my parents had thought what I am thinking. But I find the sacrifices and compromises that people make for setting up a family disconcerting. 

I am from a developing Asian country, where most jobs take up your entire waking day, leaving you with little time for yourself or your family. Yet, I find people with families going through the grind so that they can support their families. 

I never wanted to work at a job doing the same thing for years, so that I can eventually get promoted and sit in the cabin that my supervisor, who is nearing retirement, sits in. But I find people in my office doing the same thing, because they have families to support. 

I have immense respect for these people and the jobs that we do. I know and undertsand the value that people doing their jobs bring to society. Even without getting married, I would still continue working, but without the added pressure. Perhaps somewhere with less money and more something-I-don't-know-clearly-but-I-think-I-am-missing. Perhaps at my own business. (Off topic: I cannot think of pursuing my own venture with a family. The idea of failing makes it difficult. I know people will say I have to plan out the risks. That I have to take calculated risks. For eg. Build up a capital, have an emergency fund and have a plan. And then the risks may be lesser. And maybe they are true.) 

I am asking this question because something which a senior workmate said to me at work struck me. The impression I got was that he was continuing in a job, which left him with no time for his family, because he wanted that promotion and the extra money and perks that will come with it, so that he can serve his family better when he is older.

I know I am being shortsighted about many things here. For example: 

1. I might want to get married later on. If I intend to do that, I'd have to plan things differently.   

2. I have to be practical. I have to make sacrifices now, so that I can have a better life when I am older.  

3. The world does not care about my interests. I have to work hard and make money if I want to live. 

But the reason, I am being shortsighted about these points is because I really do not know them. I feel that, like the points above,  I assume a lot of things to be true. But I am not sure and I want to ask those who have been through this phase of life if they have learnt any different. 

I assume that raising kids into ""responsible"" adults is one of the highest achievements of being a human being (I mean this positively and I don't mean to offend people who chose not to or cannot have kids.). I assume ""responsible"" means who raise responsible kids of their own and/or who contribute to society. But I don't know.

Similarly, I don't know what is most imporatnt in life.

I am grateful to you for reading this through. I am asking for something which is priceless, your experience, which you had to give your life to obtain.

A young girl ran into me on her bike, apparently she lost control, did a diagonal across the path, clipped my elbow with her handlebar but when I looked back she was still upright(!), I was too so no harm done.

Guess the only thing I can do is ignore the problem and hope it sorts itself out, either with them getting caught on their own, or for them to realize that it's not worth the risks.

Edit 2: I'm going ahead and closing this down, since this is turning into ""YOU AREN'T LISTENING"" ""JEEZ GROW UP"" and other various statements. I've already apologized for arguing, I think it's high time for some of you to grow up and stop attacking me. This thread isn't about how harmless weed is, it's about what to do in a situation like this. Sure, weed is harmless. You know what else weed is? Illegal.


After being told by /r/advice that I'm apparently gay for these two and I'm a horrible person for wanting to help do something about the serious drug problem in my hometown, I come to you guys. I'm not entirely a ""grownup"" (I've still got much to learn, not much experience, hell I'm only 21.), but you guys seem like the only other subreddit I can really post this on.


I've got two friends who I've known since basically middle school. They're all around nice guys, but they've lately decided that they're going to begin selling drugs from one of their mom's house.


While I'm not one of those straight-edge ""Oh god, drugs are of the devil and need to be purged from Earth itself"" kind of guys, I still think it's pretty stupid that weed is all they ever talk about now. Like non-stop. We're talking can't last 2 minutes in a conversation without talking about how great lighting up a blunt is.


Armed with the knowledge that they're dealing, I've been tempted countless times now to just call the cops on them when I know they're making a sale, but I don't want to ruin the friendship.


I've already told them how I feel on the subject, and they're still not quite seeing it the way I do, where they're eventually going to get caught anyways, and it might be a good idea to stop doing stuff like this publicly.

I pick and choose the subreddits I subscribe to, avoid the really awful places.  But tonight's post where a guy bragged about how he and a buddy tricked their girlfriends into making out on a rollercoaster (""we'll make out if you will""), so that their picture got taken, with the guys fist pumping in the background...well, I labeled it for the tacky frat boy behavior I saw it as.

I shouldn't have.  People are wrong on the internet ALL THE TIME, and there's no crime to being young and ignorant.  But tonight, with a hard day at work behind me and part of a bottle of wine inside of me, I was just tired of it all.  So I called it tacky and dickish and a willingness to lie and break a promise if it's funny, and now I'm getting all sorts of comments calling me a wet blanket, no fun, humorless bitch.  

I've gone and unsubscribed from /r/funny.  It's honestly not all that funny.  But I'm just tired of it all tonight.
