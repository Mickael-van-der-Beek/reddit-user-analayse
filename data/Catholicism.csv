1369620450.0,303,self.Catholicism,1f441m,An atheist's love letter to /r/Catholicism,jongwon1013,336,33,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1f441m/an_atheists_love_letter_to_rcatholicism/,"A few hours ago, I posted a question here about something that Pope Francis had said about atheists.  For those who might have missed it, this is the address you can find it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1f2yfl/question_from_an_atheist/

When I came to this subreddit to post the question, I expected some insightful answers but also some nasty comments.  What I got instead was insightful and patient answers to my questions as well as an outpouring of a highly intelligent, well thought-out theological discussion/debate amongst Catholics whom I was surprised to find out did not share a monolithic view of Catholicism.  It was so much more than I had hoped.

Furthermore, there wasn't a single person who made me feel unwelcome here whatsoever.  Considering the fact that I come from a philosophical school of thought that is diagonally opposed to the Catholic Church (or most other mainstream religions), it speaks volumes toward your charity.

I didn't start out as an atheist.  I was baptized as a Presbyterian.  During my time as a Presbyterian, I heard little to nothing about the Catholic Church.  I only knew that it was the institution that other Christian denominations had broken away from.  When I later on became an atheist, I got to hear much about the Catholic Church - from the likes of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and of course, the news in regards to the legal and moral scandals that the Catholic Church has been and is still mired in.  Although I am philosophically inclined to agree with Dawkins and Hitchens rather than not, at least in regards to skepticism toward religion, it would appear that both men, along with other influential atheists, have committed the crime of failing to be civil.

What I have come to learn from this subreddit, besides the answers to my questions, is that it is far better to engage in polite discussions with people whom I disagree with rather than be a part of a like-minded mob because in the end, like-minded or not, a mob is still a mob and mobs are almost always an ugly lot.

I think the reason why people join like-minded mobs, however, is because, and I could be wrong, rightly or wrongly, people fall into a victimhood mentality - the thought that we are surrounded by enemies and that we feel the need to lash out lest we are forced out of existence.  As an individual, I doubt that my experiences here will bring about a tectonic shift in the way theists and atheists discuss with one another, much less dispel people's sense of victimhood.  However, it has reminded me of the importance of civility and the need to understand rather than hate.  Perhaps this modest start is as good as any.

Thank you, /r/Catholicism.  Though I don't think that my faith in God will be restored any time soon, you have helped to restore my faith in humanity just a bit more.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,1369620963.0,,,True,t3_1f441m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1f441m/an_atheists_love_letter_to_rcatholicism/,

Here is his original post: ""I'm an atheist, she's a Catholic...help explain the Catholic dating process and the difference of courtship to me. See text for additional details.. I should also note, that although I am atheist. She has brought me very close to god. She is a Women of such high virtue that I feel sinful without having the ability to be there for her spiritually so I have been expanding my insights into this process. As someone who's mother was raised a Roman Catholic this is an interesting Journey(I was never baptized or confirmed).""

The first response was proselytizing and trying to get him to join the Church. The second or third post called him out about bring up ""god"" and ""sin,"" to which he said ""piss off."" And the third major response said ""learn your place, boy."" 

These are not the ways of Christ or His disciples.  I tried my best responding, but the darkness from everyone else in this post resulted in him deleting it entirely. That is a Catholic Fail.

I finally did it, and the priest was so unbelievably kind. I could barely speak, and he guided me through the process. He told me that by confessing I was forgiven, and that I would still bear guilt and think about it, but I was completely forgiven in the eyes of God.

That's right folks, the only life worth living is the one of complete physical and mental health.

Now for some quotes from comments, starting with the top one. I'm bolding/italicizing the best parts:

&gt;1. It [Downs Syndrome] is, regardless of what some might think, a terrible disease which drastically reduces quality of life, and indeed lifespam [sic].

&gt;2. It sounds harsh, but I couldn't agree more. They would significantly reduce quality of life for their family, and you will have to take care of them forever. One of the joys of raising kids is to see them grow up and make something special of themselves. This way you're just sitting heartbroken and exhausted until you die of old age

&gt;3. I absolutely support this. Nothing against Down's syndrome people. It's just that back in the day, nature would handle these **problems** for you. A pack of dogs would eat them or a giant hawk would carry them off. *But now that we're civilized*, we have people breeding defective kids and there are support system all set up for them.

&gt;4. These kids put an incredibly strain on the entire family. You can love them, you can have fun with them, but that stress of dealing with someone who will *never be a whole, equal person* never goes away.

Now, of course this is talking about abortion, but I have to wonder if these people would feel the same way about the quality of life of someone who *became* handicap in an accident or illness. 

I dunno, /r/Catholicism*, but it looks like we're the only voice suggesting life is worth living not because of what you can *do*, but because of who you *are*. We are human *beings* who get our being from he who *is* being itself. Our worth comes from that reality, not what we can or can't do for others.

**Edit**: By ""we're"" I mean The Catholic Church, not our subreddit...and I don't mean that non-Catholics *aren't* voicing opposition to abortions and such, but that Catholicism *especially* teaches that the worth of a human being is not based on what he can or cannot *do*, but who he *is*: a human.

I finally stopped wimping out and made a decision. 

I've emailed people at the parish I'll be attending, I've told my parents, and I'm going to Mass on Sunday.

**I'm becoming Catholic!**

I know it's pretty involved, and I know it's going to be a while, but I know I won't regret it. 

So, that's that. 

I'm going to start a series on [my blog](http://www.316trees.blogspot.com) detailing each step, if anyone is interested in reading it. I'll post a link to the first post in this subreddit.

Also, if anyone else has experience becoming Catholic from a Protestant background, if you could comment a brief summary of what I should expect, I'd love that.

:D

Edit: so, my mom doesn't seem to believe me. I mean, she recognizes what I want to do, but she's convinced I'm more interested in ""exploring"" than actually joining. No reaction from my dad yet. Also, she thinks I mean I want to be a priest.  THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER BALL GAME.

Edit 2: My dad (former Catholic) almost seems amused. He says he wants to talk about it later, so that'll be fun :P

Edit 3: My parents are pretty good with it now. I think they're both a bit hesitant, which is understandable. My little brother is being weird about it though.

I had the biggest smile on my face afterwards, before tearing up as I walked away. For Confirmation, I wasn't nervous or shaking at all.   
I had been chosen to bring up the gifts, and I cannot tell you how humbling, yet joyful it was to know that I would be receiving the very gifts I had just offered!  
I teared up again the first Eucharist line, but had the biggest smile on when I FINALLY received our Lord! I think it was only then that I finally understood why the Eucharist is so great and treasured.  
I've finally found peace, family, Truth and a new Life this past year in the Catholic Church. The future has never looked so bright! God is truly great and incredible!!

At the request of someone on catholicism, my Aunt - who is a retired nun - will be doing an AMA this morning, March 26th from 10:30 to 2:30 Eastern time.  I will be relaying the questions to her and then either pasting email replies or typing if she elects to do this over the phone.

A couple of notes for introduction:


-She is Canadian, but doesn`t want to get more specific than that.

-She is a member of the [Sisters of Charity of St. Louis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_Charity_of_St._Louis), and primarily worked as a teacher during her time.  She also worked in Rome and Montreal as an administrator for their congregation.

-She went into the convent at age 17, and retired last year.


She asked me to be very clear that any views she expresses are hers alone.  She is not authorized to speak 'on behalf of' or representative of either the church or her order.  

I will also note that I will not pass along any obvious troll comments (not that I expect a lot in this sub-reddit), and for the duration of this article I will note if it is 'me' talking rather than her.

Thanks!!

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for your time and questions.  She has an appointment this afternoon so unfortunately we have to shut this down.  There was one question outstanding - I'm not sure if she will have a chance to respond to that but will check my email later to see if she does.

I received a private message from a user that was just created today and will probably never be logged on again. This user told me to kill myself, told me they were glad I was infertile and that it was God's way of ending my line of bigotry with me, and told me that my beliefs were far worse than the sin of supporting gay rights.

Needless to say, I am shock. Since the miscarriage of my last child on this past Christmas Eve, I have been struggling greatly with both my faith and my life. A few weeks ago, I sat on the bedroom floor, gun in my hand, ready to end it all. I wrote a letter to my husband, but I never delivered it because as I wept, I looked up at that cross above my bed and realized that there was hope, even if it was just the smallest bit.

So I went and got help. Even though I still struggle with my faith, I was part of this community because it built each other up, it built ME up, and reminded me that there are good people out there. After that message, simply entitled ""Your Catholicism"", I can't be a part of this subreddit anymore. Things have gone too far. To attack me for my beliefs is one thing, but to tell me that God has made me barren because of them is an issue of another level.

I want to thank those of you who kept me on the straight and narrow for so long. Honestly, I couldn't have done it without you. Whoever wrote me that message, I forgive you. You must be in deep pain to write something so awful to a stranger. I only hope you can forgive me for whatever I have done to upset you so much.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1by6nf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1by6nf/peace_friends/,

In real life and here. 

If you look back at my comment history, my first post was about joining the RCIA!

Here on Reddit i have met very wise, knowledgeable Catholics who demonstrate that the faith isn't empty of anything but is full of symbolism, and holy guidance and wisdom (most notably in the form of the Catechism)

I believe i was guided to this point because at many points i could have packed it all in on account of my own fractious internal discourse which plays devils advocate with everything, i was walking a knife-edge with my commitment but somehow i got through to the end.

It's only the start of my journey but i now i have recourse to Mary, angels and Guardian angels, saints (i was confirmed in the name of Jude (St. Jude the Apostle))

It was a a wholly Holy Easter Vigil. Thanks everyone and maybe i'll post here more often!

[EDIT(2): I have indeed come home to the Holy Catholic Church. Just to elucidate on my own background. I am of non-Christian heritage - hence Baptism - which makes what transpired conversion in the foremost instance. I'd like to post a quasi-ecumenical ""Why I am not ""X"".

http://i.imgur.com/QESdl2c.png

Both of you do not represent the Catholic Church's position, nor do you speak for people (like myself) with same-sex attraction.

Yes I'm not a sodomite, nor do I think that being homosexual makes certain sins worse in the eyes of God (and definitely not worse than murder). But this doesn't mean I don't accept what is natural and a given: The complementarity of the sexes and its life-giving properties that come along with it. Please stop assuming that you are defending me/us when you support the redefinition of marriage and the acceptance of sexual sins socially.

Again I would like to note how amazing the Church has been in being the voice of reason and moderation throughout the century. It's really funny how one side calls it the extreme right, and another the extreme left, when it is the Extreme Truth. It doesn't teach the acceptance of sin, nor the shunning of the sinner who is struggling and seeking redemption.

Tl;Dr : The Church is awesome. God is awesome. I am way too happy even though it's a Monday and I'm bombarded with [this] (http://imgur.com/2DanLLF) on the one place I thought I could come and celebrate this awesomeness.

I'm writing this because I and a few others on /r/Catholicism have been guilty of it, and quite frankly, it needs to stop.

We can't run around /r/Catholicism trying to evangelize, use apologetics, or demonstrate our knowledge of theology or Church History and act like complete and total jerks to other users and still call ourselves ""Good"" Catholics.

I notice that a lot of times, random folks pop in to ask strange questions, and the knee-jerk reaction is ""OMG A TROLL"" and people either start firing off apologetical scripture references and CCC block-quote-bombs, or they use sarcasm and belittling comments to respond...instead of actually trying to give a well thought out response. Every absurd question isn't an automatic troll...given the state of Religious Ed in the Church and of religious understanding in the USA, yes, people are really *that* confused about religion that sometimes it seems like only a troll would ask such a stupid question. If they obviously start trolling, then hey, feel free to CCC/Bible-bomb them...but do it without name-calling.

I found some evangelization Guidelines from a popular Catholic forum that I think are appropriate for us all to keep in mind when dealing with others:

- Do unto others as you would have them do unto you...*not* do unto others before they do unto you!
- Always be respectful.
- Question others; do not accuse them.
- Do not question someone's sincerity of belief.
- Do not assume you know someone else's mind/motives.
- Don't use derogatory names or insults.
- Don't place labels on people.
- Discuss, not bash.

Basically, whether we like it or not, when people come to /r/Catholicism to ask Catholics about the Catholic faith, *we* are representing our Church to them. What we say is taken as what the Church says. When we insult users, belittle them, call them names, or are generally rude to them (even if they are this way to us), then to the observer, it is the Church that is being a jerk.

A simple rule to remember: Accept all people as Christ...

&gt; Then the righteous will answer him, “Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?” And the king will answer them, “Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.” 

- Matthew 25:37-40

From the context of that passage we learn about the Corporal Works of Mercy, which pair also with the Spiritual Works of instructing the ignorant and admonishing sinners. If you wouldn't speak to Christ with some of the language and attitude you have when speaking to other redditors, then re-evaluate your approach or shut up. It doesn't matter how ""right"" or correct you are in your statements, if you are being rude, arrogant, or mean, then your message is *wrong*.

**TL;DR**: Don't be a Jerk for Jesus, because if you are, you are being a Jerk *to* Jesus.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,1359819294.0,,,True,t3_17r7gg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/17r7gg/how_not_to_be_a_cathojerk_for/,

1367292587.0,89,self.Catholicism,1ddzky,From the Moon to the Cross. My story of my conversion from Islam to Catholicism.,SlouchKlown,108,19,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1ddzky/from_the_moon_to_the_cross_my_story_of_my/,"My story is insanely long, so grab some popcorn or something. I dont think im going to edit this because of how long its going to take me to type, so pardon any grammar or spelling mistakes. A couple things to note: Im still new to the faith, I was baptized, confirmed, and received first Eucharist on Easter Vigil night, because of that, Im still learning lots. Ive currently started an online reading plan that reads me through the bible in a year, and then every month I pick a book to study, probably starting from the old testament . Im going to mention my vocation to priesthood a lot in this. I know the churches stance, a newly baptized must wait 2 years to join the seminary, but as the story goes you'll notice that a year before my baptism (when I was converted) God was already making it extremely obviously where He wanted me. With that, lets begin.

I believe everything happens for a reason, but I could never explain my first memory until a few weeks ago. My first ever memory, I remember being surrounded by darkness, sounding like I was drowning. I could see what looked like a white line going vertically across my vision. A few weeks ago, I realized this was a memory of me in my mother womb. When my mother was with my biological father, he had forced her to get two abortions. I dont know if these were before or after me. Regardless to say, if you need proof that theres life in the womb, there it is. I actually remember being inside it.

Well when I was a newborn baby, my mother and father had baptized me as a Muslim. We went to mosque regularily, but I was never taught what was being said. Everything was spoken in arabic after all. All I knew was that we believed in a God and he was merciful. I also knew we followed a man called the Aga Khan, supposedly the decedant of prophet muhammed. Thing is, we worshiped this man as if he was God. Something didnt seem right to me, the entire thing just felt like a giant scam. On top of that, my parents divorced. I couldnt believe in a God that would let something like that happen.  Around age 9 I quit believing in God and insisted on never going to mosque if I could help it. I still got dragged along every so often, but I sure didnt like it. 

My atheist life was interesting. I was a very angry kid. I got into fights, I actually almost killed 2 people in my younger teen years. As I started aging, I started realizing that I was so angry simply because of how the world has evolved in terms of human interaction. The world is cold and cruel place and had made me the same. I found a quote that I live by to this day. ""Be the change you wish to see in the world""-Ghandi. Problem was, I didnt know how to be a positive influence on the world around me.

Shortly after I got into drugs and was drinking heavily all the time. I was around 15-16 at the time. I dont really want to dwell too much on this, but my life was becoming a mess. I had been kicked out of mothers house (who had remarried a catholic man and had 2 children by this point) and my father house. I was living with my grandparents and things were rocky there too. Essentially, I was trying to kick a hard drug and was going through withdrawals and didnt know what to do, so I told my parents. I went through rehab treatments, psych wards (I was suicidal), was in lockdown in my own house, was arrested 2 times for trying to run. Id like to tell you ive been sober for 4 years (Im 20 now) but thats simply not true. Im not sure on your guys stance on pot, but I still consider it a drug, and I had some a few months before my baptism. Regardless of that, I had eventually decided that I didnt want to do drugs anymore and would do my best to stay clean. I obviously had my slips here and there, but I always got back on me feet. I started going to Narcotics anonymous meetings, and in their 12 step program, the third step is to find ""God or a form of higher power"". Seemed like a load of crap to me, so I stopped going.

3 years ago, my mother had gone on a trip to India. My stepdads mother lived there so they went to visit her. My mother was gone for 3 months and I never heard anything from her. When she came back, she took me for a drive, and the first thing she told me was ""Im going to be baptized into the Roman Catholic Church"". This was HUGE, she was still a practicing Muslim up to this point. I was extremely shocked, but I said ""I dont agree with your choice, but if it will make you happy then go for it, Im not one to stop you."" I attended her baptism at Easter Vigil. I was happy for her, she had gone through a lot of stuff and whatever had happened to her definitely had made her happy. 

Well a year ago at lent, my mother had brought a man from Dubai named Aneel Aranha to speak at some of our local parishes. He runs a global ministry called Holy Spirit Interactive. He has a wonderful story of how he was an Atheist for 20 something odd years of his life and came back to the church and is now a worldwide evangelist. Heres his website if you want to check him out and contact him to come to your local parish. http://www.holyspiritinteractive.org/. By this point in my life I was trying to search for deeper meaning of existence (really weird for a 19 year old to be thinking about I know). I had gotten back in drinking very heavily too. I was becoming extremely depressed, to the point where I was inflicting harm on my own body. My mother insisted that I meet with this guy, and since she wouldnt leave me alone, I agreed. I walked into the room with him, and I said this.
""I believe there must be some kind of a higher power or 'God' out there, but I do not like religion and I do not like the church."" Aneel, being a man of very few words in personal conversation, simply said this. "" I believe in God, but I agree with your stance on religion"". Just like that, I was convinced to listen to his 3 day program. I recently asked him why he said that, after all he preaches telling people to go to confession, repent, and be children of God. He still says he has NO idea why he said it, but the Holy Spirit was INSISTENT of him saying it to me. This is where my story takes a very mystical turn, which most people do not believe.

I went to Aneels 3 day program. On all the days, he talked about how cold and cruel the world is, how much hate and intolerance is present in everyday lives, how evil and corrupt the world around us has become. Essentially, everything in my life I had experienced, he was preaching right back to me. I had this supernatural sensation that my destiny was to be sitting in this church listening to this man. He would talk about the way to redemption through Christ and things like that too, but I was not as focused on that. On the third day, he held a giant healing mass. For those of you who have never been to one of these, what essentially happens is you get prayed over by a priest of a lay person in an attempt to bring the holy spirit into you, to bring healing into your life. Its not one of those events where people are screaming and slapping each other, just getting prayed over. 

I had never heard of the charismatic side of the church, and let me tell you I was TERRIFIED of what was happening around me. I was asked to volunteer to catch people as they were slain in the spirit, and I watched as some people were literally blasted off their feet. People on the ground would start singing in tongues, and it scared the heck out of me. Eventually everyone in the church was finished, except of course, for me. I went to go sit down, but my mother insisted on me getting prayed over. I just went to one of the priests, and he hovered his hand over me. I closed my eyes and sat there as he prayed, when I started to feel something push on my forehead. I opened my eyes, and his hands were still quite a distance away from me. I figured I was imagining things, and closed my eyes again. The pushing got more forceful, and eventually it was like the force of a sledgehammer had hit me in the face (No pain dont worry). I fell to the ground, but I was totally aware of my surroundings, I could hear people talking and moving.

I figured I should stand up, as everyone was waiting for me to get up and sit, but when I tried to move my legs I couldnt. I tried to move my arms and I couldnt. I tried to at least open my eyes, and I could not. I was paralyzed totally, so in my mind I began to freak right out. And then I heard a voice tell me ""Shaf, be calm"" (Shaf is what everyone calls me, my full name is shafraz). Naturally, I freak out even more, Im hearing voices! Again, I hear a voice say ""Shaf, be calm"". So I calm down and I say in my mind ""Ok, im calm, im listening"".
The voice then said ""Shaf, you are meant for so much more than this, YOU, will change the world"". My body unfroze and my eyes snapped open. I Got up to see my mother bawling her eyes out behind me, and I sat down. 

I struggled for an extremely long time with that experience, and eventually had to believe I had heard the voice of God that night, or more specifically the Holy Spirit. Usually my story ends here, about me telling you how I kicked all my addictions. I quit binge drinking, I quit smoking, all effortlessly through the power of the Holy Spirit.  I would normally tell you I would be getting baptized the coming Easter, but my baptism has already happened, so all of you who are reading this are the first people who will get to hear the (extremely awesome) experience I had at my baptism.

By this point I had already received many many gifts of the spirit, including some charismatic ones such as Tongues, Interpretation of Tongues, Wisdom and Knowledge. I had dreams and visions, and lots and lots of ""Supernatural"" events. God continuously brought people into my life who already assumed I was a priest just when they saw me. I even had a Jesuit priest come up to me and ask what order I belonged to! I understand God wanted me to become a part of this vocation, but I also knew I was ALWAYS given a choice. I didnt know if I could do it, I had problems, and sometimes still do, with my sexual desires. I wanted to have kids someday. I know the option of a Deacon was there, but It was either Priest or nothing. Well, that decision was made shortly after my baptism

The day of my baptism, I was a nervous wreck. I had an experience similar to the day of my conversion, in which the spirit told me to keep my eyes open as I was submerged into the water (We were dunked into a hot tub of blessed water).I stepped into the water and got on my knees, and agreed to be baptized. Im going to write this EXACTLY how I had experienced it. Keep in mind, I did not think I would actually FEEL anything, I believed the whole thing was merely symbolic.

""Shafraz I baptize you in the name of the Fath-"" I got dunked. I opened my eyes, and immediately became winded, as if I was being bear hugged extremely tightly. I lost every breath of air in me, and I came back up. ""And in the name of the-"" Dunked, before I could even breathe. This time, it seemed like all of time had slowed down. I could feel something leaving my body, as if something was being sucked through every pore and opening in my body, including my eyes. Like a vacuum was trying to suck out my soul. ""And in the name of the Holy Spir-"" Dunked again. What happened at this point may never be able to be explained properly. I could write an entire series of books on what I had felt, and still would not be able to accurately describe what happened to me that night. It was as if my entire being was sucked away and left inside the water. I felt empty, like there was nothing inside me, but in a good sense, like a anvil has been lifted off of me. I had a huge crowd there to support me, and as I stepped out of the water, all I could hear was yelling and screaming and cheering. People were running and giving me handshakes, but I still had the empty feeling, so I just smiled and went to get changed for confirmation.

My confirmation ceremony was nothing too crazy, after all I had already been baptized by fire in the Holy Spirit. If you are curious, I had chosing Saint Augustine as my patron saint. The story is long as to why I chose him, but if you ever read his life, its almost an exact mimic of mine. We were both credited as great speaker, had mothers that continuously prayed for us, worshiped false gods, were both party animals, had experiences with the Holy Sprit, and he even became a priest, a bishop to be exact!

My first Holy Communion was definitely  a tremendous experience. I did truly believe Jesus was present, body blood soul and divinity, but I did not believe I would feel anything substantial except maybe a good happy feeling after eating Him. We were sitting at the front of the church and the priest was walking to each of his to give us the Body, and as my turn came, I hears a voice so powerful that it made my body shake. It said ""Kneel before your God"". I immediately dropped to my knees and received it  on my tongue. My body began to shake violently. I could feel this warming sensation spreading throughout my body, but I could NOT stop shaking. Then the blood was passed, and I took a sip. When it touched my tongue, it was like I was struck by lightning, the shaking was even more excessive. I could not stop vibrating for almost an hour afterwards. But most of all, the peace I had felt when receiving was the most spectacular thing I had ever felt. I was at so much peace I could barely speak at all. I just wanted to sit in silence and ecstasy.

From that day, I had decided that all of the goals I had set in my life would not even come close in comparison to the feeling I had that day if I accomplished them. I swore my life to Gods service and have now decided to join the seminary as soon as possible. 

I want to thank you guys for reading this. This story is in no way to say ""Im so much more spiritual than you are"", I feel my writing style might impact people that way. I still have much to learn, and a long long way to go in my journey. I still have yet to truly understand what is meant by ""You will change the world"", but I leave it in Gods hands and have complete trust in him.

Please feel free to ask me anything, ill be here almost all night.

God bless
-Shaf

It was surprisingly easy. Took about 2 days to kick the habit, and after that I didn't even miss it, though I really thought I was going to.

2. Reddit overstates its own significance. After stepping away, the question of what other redditors think, or what is being talked about on reddit seemed not only unimportant to me, but also to the world at large. For some reason everything on reddit seemed like a big deal before.

3. Being ""a redditor"" is a rather meaningless form of identity.

4. Reddit is a fantastic tool for communication with young people beyond your own social sphere. I place a greater value than before on the gift it is to have all of you only a few keystrokes away.

5. Christians have little need to feel offended because offense diminishes with perspective. I often found myself offended as a Catholic, a theist, a woman, etc while browsing reddit in the past, but the depth of the offense came from an overblown idea of the significance of a reddit comment, or 100 upvotes, or 3 downvotes. 

6. Wasting time on reddit (beyond using it as a tool) seems like an innocent vice, but every moment spent on page 15 of r/ffffffuuuuuuuuu is a moment that could have drawn you closer to God, to a friend who needs you, to a deeper vision of life, or even some extra sleep you probably need.

7. ""Do not conform any longer to the pattern of reddit, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."" is very cheesy, but makes some serious sense to me now.

It's wonderful to be back with a new perspective. Hope you all had a wonderful Lent! I'm so grateful to be able to rejoin the fellowship here!",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_s1lah,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/s1lah/what_i_learned_from_giving_up_reddit_for_lent/,

It's a throwaway account and he's since disappeared, so thankfully, its probably not true.

I expected that there would be mass-downvoting against the redditors who dared mention that a human life had been ended.  But the ways that some of them rationalized it, saying that the mother's life would have been wrecked by having the child, and - worst of all -  how one of them *thanked* him for what he had done.......it made me want to throw up.  I may yet - I've never been this appalled.  

I never understood why the Church was so adamant about abortion.  Now I get it.  It's not just that it's murder.  It's not just that the victim is a helpless, innocent baby.  Rather, it's the loss of humanity that occurs - *that people can actually express gratitude to someone for committing such a horrible act.*

John's friend, Isa—a very intelligent and faithful Muslim—expressed an interest in understanding the Catholic faith (not out of any doubt of his own) and asked John to take him to Mass. After Mass, John asked Isa what he had thought of it. Isa said, very slowly and thoughtfully, ""Do Catholics really believe that thing, that piece of bread, is not bread at all but Jesus Christ (blessed be his name)?"" (Christ is a revered prophet to Muslims, though not the Son of God.)

""We do, said John.

""Your Church teaches that he is really present there, yes? That what's there is the man who was God?"" ""

Yes. The formula is 'Body and blood, soul and divinity.'""

""And you believe that?"" ""Yes.""

Isa made as if to say something, but stifled it. John assured him he would not be offended.

Finally, reluctantly, Isa said, ""I don't understand.""

""I understand how you feel. It sounds very shocking.""

""No, you don't understand. That's not what I mean. You will take it as an insult, but I don't mean it to be.""

""I promise I won't take it as an insult. But I really want to know what's on your mind.""

""Well then. ...I don't think you really do believe that. I don't mean to say you're dishonest, but . . . .""

""I think I know what you mean. You can't empathize with anyone who believes something so shocking. You don't see how you could ever get down on your knees before that altar.""

""No, I don't see how I could ever get up. If I believed that thing that looks like a little round piece of bread was really Allah Himself, I think I would just faint. I would fall at His feet like a dead man.""

John looked carefully at my reaction as he reported Isa's words. My eyes opened, and he smiled. ""What did you say to him?"" I asked.

""Nothing. Then, after a while, just 'Yes.""' John is a wise man. ",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_15nbnk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/15nbnk/what_i_learned_from_a_muslim_about_eucharistic/,

One thing I've noticed is that, within Protestantism, there tend to be two movements--the liberal relativists, who want to throw out any belief that they don't like or that doesn't fit with their view of how the world should be apart from their religious views (i.e., their worldview shapes their religious views, and not vice versa), and the conservative fundamentalists, who take extreme positions, and often take the Bible too literally. Catholicism, meanwhile, takes the moderate course. It avoids the errors of relativism without sinking into fundamentalism. It teaches faith and reason together. It opposes sin without attacking those under its power. It's truly a wonderful thing that we don't often take time to think about that Catholicism is, was, and always will be set up in such a way that it will take the moderate course, preserve the faith, and not get too entangled in contemporary squabbles.

Furthermore, Catholicism is *hard*. It's uncomfortable, both in terms of what we believe, and in terms of the limitations we place on ourselves. We don't simply give in to our desires, but rather place emphasis on control. We strive to do what we are called to do, and to believe what we should believe, regardless of the discomfort it may cause.

These reasons, for me, are evidence that Catholicism is right--it isn't easy, and isn't something that can be shaped to our will, and furthermore, it avoids the two major errors that have divided Christianity today.

Just felt like sharing these observations; they're something we should think about more, and share with our friends to show them what Catholicism really is.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1h8h5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1h8h5f/a_few_thoughts_on_catholicism_and_where_it_stands/,

My mother's reaction was at first kind; she tried to understand.  As soon as she walked out of the room, despair took hold of her and she kept repeating how God had failed her, she had failed me, I had failed her.

My dad's reaction was the opposite.  He was angry, even livid at first, but after cooling down we hammered out some doctrinal issues.  He realized he was wrong in a few areas, and expressed a lot of hope for our relationship.  

If it's not too much to ask, could you please pray for my parents?  They're going through a lot right now.  I'm mainly just feeling guilty and sad for them, but if you want to pray for me too, it is always appreciated.

Why can't the Church allow homosexuals to get married?! Why does the Church enter the public square on issues?), and with seeing basically the same replies every thread, along with the continuing growth of the forum, I think a FAQ is almost certainly needed at this point instead of the constant deluge of '..well I just don't think that's right, women should be Priests' or 'What is the Church doing about pedophiles?', 'Why not birth control and abortion?', and the ineffable 'Why not Zoidberg?', that's been basically been going on the past year or so. In point, its extremely frustrating to see a well typed out response that had to have taken some time to do, official citations, references and all, and then two days later seeing the same thread-line of questions posed again. It takes fifteen seconds to make an accusation or question, but fifteen minutes to answer.

I see this as an increasing problem here for a few reasons. Chiefly, that those who are replying genuinely want to answer/help those that have questions, and try to do so (generally, heh) with well-cited and researched replies. But with those replies, and the sometimes inevitable 'well what about *THIS* completely unrelated thing!' reply, a burn-out comes. Only so many times can I reference the Catechism on homosexuality (surprise, we don't hate homosexual people!) before I just stop because I'm *literally tired of doing it*.  

Thoughts? Opinions on how to get this done? Should we even do one? Should we hold off?

Acceptance can be really hard for me for certain situations. Yesterday I had a hard time accepting the fact that another Catholic didn't agree with me with the use or legalization of marijuana in the United States. Today,however, it makes things like marijuana seem extremely trivial in my mind when I wake up this morning and stumble across the AMA. What got me the most was two words in the first sentence. ""In celebration"". 

I'm heading to a 7a.m Mass. Peace

TL;DR-Waking up to two abortion clinic workers on AMA makes me sad and puts perspective on life for me

1361763539.0,57,self.Catholicism,1966g7,6 reasons why Redditors should attend my Parish when visiting Chicago.,Exponential,61,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1966g7/6_reasons_why_redditors_should_attend_my_parish/,"I absolutely love [my Parish](http://www.cantius.org/) and I'm certain catholic redditors would as well, so I want to convince you to stop by if you're ever in town.  

1. **It's proximity to Public Transportation** - If you're visiting Chicago, you're likely close to CTA stop.  St. John Cantius is located a block from the Chicago blue line stop.  30 minutes from O'Haire by 'L' or a few minutes from downtown.  Either way, [getting there is super easy](http://www.cantius.org/go/about_us/category/directions/).

2. **Confession before *and during* every mass** - This one is big for me.  I love the fact that if I need/want to go to confession, its available.  During mass there are usually 3 confessors available.  

3. **Solid Homilies - Orthodox, engaging, challenging.** Some of the best homilies I've ever heard have been from Father Bartholomew, one of the [6 Priests](http://www.cantius.org/go/about_us/category/parish_staff/) who serve the Parish. 

4.  **Wide options in Mass form** - You like Latin?  You like Tridentine?  You like Novus Ordo in English?  We've got you covered.  Cantius offers a [wide variety of worship options](http://www.cantius.org/go/liturgy_devotions/category/liturgical_devotional_schedule/). *see below

5. **Reverence** - The Parish itself is home to a religious order, founded in 1998, [The Society of St. John Cantius](http://www.canons-regular.org/).  The [charism](http://www.canons-regular.org/go/about/charism/) of the society is to ""Restore the sacred"" within the Church and everyday life.  This translates into masses that are absolutely stunning.  Always reverent, serious, uplifting.  Check out these [pictures of Palm Sunday 2011](http://cantius.org/uploads/photos/2011-palm-sunday/) to get an idea what a mass looks like at Cantius.

6.  **The Music** Oh the glorious music.  Music is a [HUGE part](http://www.cantius.org/go/music/) of this parish's identity.  Every Sunday at every mass heavenly sounds fill the air.  At any one mass as many as two, yes two, of the Parish's [eight choirs](http://www.cantius.org/go/music/category/choirs_of_st_john_cantius/) will lift their voices heaven.  Right now the Choir Loft is being reinforced in preparation for installation of The Casavante Opus 1130 pipe organ, being saved from a Methodist Church, and [will be installed this summer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=W5wpnvpVJ8A)  Many consider this organ to be the best sounding pipe organ in Chicago.

Afterwards, I spoke with the priest for about 20 minutes. Underwent confession. Did penance. I tell you, the feeling I had from being forgiven for my sins was great.

The priest was SO nice about everything, too. I think he knew I'm a keeper and that I'll be back!

I wasn't sure about a lot of what was going on (mainly the responses to things), but I met a woman there who helped me out, so I won't be afraid to go back.

Going to Mass, doing confession, meeting the priest were definitely the right thing for me to do.

&gt;Dear Member of the (High School)'s Family,

&gt;I regret to inform you that the (High School)’s campus suffered vandalism last night:  the cafeteria, the chapel, the baseball facility, Founders’ Circle, the main school building, and our religious statues were spray painted with graffiti.  What is particularly disturbing is the nature of the graffiti:  anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, pro-satanic, and obscene.  The police have said it qualifies as a “hate crime.” 

&gt;While we will try to get things back to normal for Monday, as I really don’t want any of you exposed to this level of hatred, I cannot guarantee it.  Maintenance Director (name) and a couple of parents in the painting business are determining the best course of action.  In any event, we WILL definitely have school on Monday!

&gt;Word is already spreading among the student body, so I wanted you to hear from me what happened, as I’m sure the story will magnify as it’s re-told.

&gt;What I don’t want is “conclusion jumping” as to who and why this act of destruction was committed.

&gt;We pray for those who are so filled with hate that they must senselessly destroy.  May God convert their hearts with His love.  I’ll keep you informed.

Not the best of His sons, but in his last years, the best man he could have been. I love you grandpa.

I am an Independent Protestant that currently attends a United Methodist Church. Recently I have been extremely intrigued and fascinated by Catholicism, and am considering converting. So, if you are a Catholic that was once a Protestant, I have a few questions for you (if you don't mind answering):

1.) What drew you as a Protestant to convert to Catholicism?

2.) What about converting to Catholicism did you find most difficult?

3.) How did other Christians react when they found out that you had converted?

4.) Is there anything I should know about or watch out for before I convert (assuming that I do)?

I know that both Protestants and Catholics serve the same God and His Son, and that both are going to heaven. But recently I've felt like God's calling me to Catholicism. I don't know why He would, but I do know that if He's calling me there then it's because He wants to use me there. I don't know how He would, but I know He would. God wouldn't call me to make so drastic a decision for no reason (I trust).

*NOTE: I am open to responses from everyone, but I prefer responses from Catholics that were once Protestants. And please, no responses that attack nuances in either Protestant or Catholic doctrine. I am asking an honest question, and do not want this to explode into some pointless debate.

**ANOTHER NOTE: I hate using a word like ""convert,"" as Protestants and Catholics follow the same faith, just in different forms.

1. No accusations. Everyone here is a Catholic making a serious attempt to understand and live out Church teaching. Let us give each other the benefit of the doubt. For now, lets assume that no one here is a bigot, or a cafeteria Catholic.

2. Be thoughtful. Say a prayer before you submit a comment and consider whether your words will bring clarity and focus to the discussion, or if you're muddying the waters.

Some points that I think are very worth discussing are

1. Why does the Church teach that sacramental marriage is between one man and one woman?

2. What is the distinction between sacramental marriage and civil marriage?

3. What is the relationship between sacramental marriage and civil marriage?

4. What role does civil marriage play in secular society?

5. How exactly does civil gay marriage pose or not pose a threat to sacramental marriage?

6. How do we decide as Catholic citizens where to draw the line between legislating morality, and cultivating freedom?

This decree covers many areas of social communication even before those means existed.  I think that Catholic Redditors might be surprised that there are little challenges to each of us to stand up for truth and be witnesses to the Gospel in this important decree.  

We often place clergy and religious as the foremost evangelizers but the laity has an extraordinarily important role.  Many priests and sisters know nothing about Reddit and are probably not inclined to learn about Rage Comics, Advice Animals, or up-voting.  
The decree reminds the users of social media to “…strive, through these media as well, to form and spread sound public opinion (IM 8).”  The decree also warns those involved not to put themselves in the danger of sin or evil.  

It seems that the Second Vatican Council anticipated the various forms of social communication even though there was no internet and in many places less than 3 television channels.  We should take care to read what the Second Vatican Council says about social communication to help us be better evangelizers in the world.

tl;dr - read this thing [Decree on the Media of Social Communication]( http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19631204_inter-mirifica_en.html) (It's longer than this post)

And, as a Jesuit, he's probably always know that martyrdom is a possibility. The limited protection provided by the popemobile is probably not worth the barrier.

Is this 51% of the Catholics non-church goers that just associated with Catholicism still? According to the gallup poll which mixed every religion, if you attend weekly you're more opposed, but if it is less often you're more for gay marriage.

Anyone have studies on this? I am very, very curious being a ""Cafeteria"" Catholic.  I'd love to know the percentage of weekly church-goes who feel this way. Since the gallup poll mixes them all and protestants scored much lower it is hard to tell. 

It seems the Catholics who stopped going weekly may have stopped because of their stance on homosexuality and marriages. Obviously this is correlation and does not mean causation. But I am highly intrigued on how Catholics poll today in America and what it means.

My quality of life has gone down. I cannot sleep because all I do is look for answers on the internet, which leads to me being more exposed to stupid things like gore videos, pornography etc.

A friend of mine left our non-denominational church about a year ago and last night we hung out and started talking. He's been looking into Catholicism and he shared some videos from Mark Hart (10 reason's not to leave the Catholic Church) and Fr. Robert Barron. 

After about 2 hours I sat there feeling. 

#1. Very drawn to Catholic doctrine and wanting a better understanding of Catholicism

#2. Very surprised at how much I agreed with just about everything said and how some of it echoed thoughts I have already had/things I have already heard in 12 years at my Non-denominational church.

#3. Very sorry for judging Catholics in the way I have.

At this point I am prayerfully considering the possibility God may be calling myself and my friend to the Catholic church and I was wondering as far as Mass goes. 

Can I just show up? 
Is there anything specific I should know before attending?

I hate having them believe I've failed them somehow.  I hate hurting them this way.  But... when you know the truth, there is no denying it.

I was told by my Archbishop that I should share my story. As I have a few hours now until I have to get dressed up and head to church, now is a good time to write it out.

I was raised in a ""non-denominational"" Protestant family. My parents were not very religious, but they exposed it to me well enough. I was never baptized. We went to a few churches and I started going to youth services at one of them on a regular basis. I made friends and learned the basics of Christianity.

I took the message to heart. I went on retreats and cared about it in a very sincere way. I remember the feeling of ""spiritual joy"" I had during worship and when I was 13 years old I prayed for Jesus to enter my heart.

However nobody seemed to take it as seriously as me. Friends, family, and others were apparently not as moved by the idea of God. I started feeling slightly apart due to my religious belief.

A few years later while I tried reading the Bible. I enjoyed Genesis well enough, and thought Exodus was enjoyable (despite some seemingly excessive details of the Arc/tabernacle/etc). But when I got to Leviticus I lost it. This religion was just too weird. So much animal sacrifice, so much other stuff that made no sense to me and seemed archaic. How could this be the teaching of the unchanging God? I couldn't make sense of it with the Christianity I had been taught.

First I disqualified the Bible. Then I disqualified the churches I went to, because they preached the Bible but seemed to hide these issues. I tried to look inward for God, and come up with my own rationale of how he must operate. I studied all of the other religions and tried to fuse them into something syncretic and just.

But eventually I realized I had no basis for this. I decided I had been duped. God wasn't real, and I had been a fool to believe in him.

Thus I became an atheist and took on a cynical and jaded worldview. Perhaps if God wasn't real, the prohibitions on lust were unnecessary; so I began indulging in sexual sin. If God wasn't real, maybe the notion of love and forgiveness was naive; so I began to indulge in hatred and cruelty. If God wasn't real, maybe trying to evade death through religion was merely comforting fantasy; so I began to embrace the thought of my own death as though it were a welcoming end to a difficult and pointless life.

However, I could possibly use this life to maximize worldly experiences and pleasures. For many people, life started to seem almost like a game to see who would enjoy it the most before they died. But something deep inside kept me melancholic and I refused to accept hedonism as an ethical system. I indulged in it all sorts of sins but I still felt sort of bad about them.

It was when I reached the apex of my sins, when I started to truly hate the poor for their failings, when I felt envious of everyone else who I thought had better lives than me, and when I started indulging in truly heinous sexual desires, that I felt separated from the rest of humanity. I could only see myself as either above everyone else, or below everyone else. It seemed like an endless cycle between those two perspectives.

I studied all manner of atheistic philosophy, especially existentialism and absurdism. I started buying into anti-theistic rhetoric and accusing everyone who seemed content of deluding themselves in some way. Camus told me that the proper way to live life was to imagine Sisyphus, the Greek myth of a man who is doomed to push a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll down again just before the peak, forever. We were supposed to imagine that he was happy.

I found this rather unsatisfactory; it seemed like another form of self-delusion, and a miserable one. So I started studying theological existentialism. I was heavily moved by the Brothers Karamazov and started to think I should consider religion again from a clean slate.

I studied more: Kierkegaard, CS Lewis, GK Chesterton. It was a new take on religion I had never heard before. I thought that I should try going to church again. By now I was 30 years old.

There is a large cathedral nearby which was calling out to me, so I went there. I had never known anything about Catholicism before this. I did some brief research, and it seemed to me that it was the original Christian church, so I figured it would be a good place to start. I became interested in Catholic perspectives of things like Luther, and thoroughly impressed by the level of theology and history I found in the Church. It seemed much more intellectual and philosophical than the Christianity I had grown up with. I liked that it kept integrity all the way back to the time of St. Peter instead of disowning over a millennium of tradition.

When I first went to Mass, it was a confusing experience. I had no idea what liturgy was. But I was impressed by the solemnity of it. It was very moving and sincere. You had the feeling that this was a serious occasion. Given my melancholy nature this fit right in perfectly. I enjoyed singing.

I came to love the ritualistic elements and the more I studied the more I was convinced this was the church for me. I thought that regular Mass attendance, confession of sins, and the Eucharist would aid me in my quest to improve my soul from its ruined state.

So far it has had a big effect on me. Catholic views have affected all of my political opinions. I came to see the desperately poor around me not as the scum of humanity, but as my neighbors. I started almsgiving again. I am surprised by how this enormous and thorough ideology which is so important to the world and history has been so neglected in my life. I have now read over half of the Bible, and it makes much more sense now than it did when I was a teen.

Telling my friends and family was difficult. It was embarrassing. Some were disappointed but others were happy and supportive. Ultimately though I was surprised by the level of acceptance, and I try to keep it relatively private and intimate.

I cannot be sure what the future holds, but RCIA ends tonight and I will be baptized, confirmed, and take First Communion. I have butterflies in my stomach, but I think I can relax myself when the time comes. Last night I was in a sort of agony as I thought about the life and mentality I was leaving behind by taking this step. There were a lot of evil pleasures I can no longer enjoy fully. From now on I will not be able to sin without confessing it. This fills me with a conflicting sense of both hope and dread. But mostly hope.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1bbvoz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1bbvoz/i_will_be_baptized_tonight/,
1363607420.0,48,self.Catholicism,1aipnl,St. Malachi was right after - why Francis is Petrus Romanus,Speculum,71,23,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1aipnl/st_malachi_was_right_after_why_francis_is_petrus/,"So you were expecting Peter II....(Peter the Roman at the end of whose reign Rome will be destroyed)? I know some people are confused now wondering how the prophecy of Malachi applies to Pope Francis I. Well, look closer! It is not difficult to see 

1) Card. Bergoglio took the name of Francis after Francis of Assisi. Now Francis of Assisi's real baptismal name was Giovanni or John. Now, among the apostles there were two pairs of brothers ""James and John"" and ""Peter and Andrew"". If their names are ordered alphabetically, then the pairing is Andrew-James and John-Peter. Now clearly this means that John and Peter really are the same, whence by taking the name Francis references John and clearly indicates Peter.

2) Card Bergoglio clearly is ""the Roman"". He might come from Buenos Aires but his ancestors are from Piemont. The capital of Piemont is Torino. Now with the high speed train Frecciarossa it takes 4:10 h from Torino to Roma. This is 250 minutes. If you add the number of white and yellow (papal colors) umbrellas present yesterday at St. Peters, then guess what: it adds up to 665. A clear indication that the ""beast"" is around the corner.

3) Rome will be destroyed. This is even easier to see. Following the example of Pope Francis, people in Rome will leave their Fiats at home and take the bus. What will look like an environmental revolution in the beginning will lead to the destruction of Rome. For there will be much less traffic and consequently much, much less honking. This in turn will mean that Italian pedestrians will no longer be able to navigate safely through traffic while texting on their phones. Within days of the ascension of Pope Francis, an estimate 150.000 pedestrians will die tragically resulting in chaos, contempt and uprisings: the ruin of Rome. The ""dreadful judge"" could refer to Berlusconi, but that is not quite clear yet.

QED. You see it all makes perfect sense 
So be careful and watch out...and don't text while walking through the streets of Rome over the next few days!

I went to Rome, and visited a few beautiful Catholic churches there.  I was wondering about some things I saw, and I don't come from a Christian background, or know any Christians in real life to ask, so I hope people won't mind if I ask here?  

1.  What are the ""side churches"" in the bigger churches used for?  I'm not sure what they are called, but the rooms off the side of a big church, that have their own altar, and seats.  Would there be a smaller Mass going on here at the same time as the main church? 

2.  In St. Peter's Basilica, we saw the grave of a pope, in a glass coffin.  That was the first time I had seen a grave in a church where the body of the person was visible, and I was wondering if there is a story behind this particular grave being different?  I could tell it was a very special place for the Catholic visitors, we saw many people were praying in the seats set up in front.

3.  At one church we saw some little booths with Priests sitting inside, talking to people through a window, I thought it might be for confessions, but it wasn't private, the people were not sitting in the booth, it looked like a window you might buy tickets or food from is the best way I can describe it.  What are these for?

4.  Lastly, I was wondering if there are specific things that Catholics do when they visit a church - I noticed that while many tourists like me walk in the front door and then just stop and look up and around at the beautiful building, some people clearly walk in with purpose.  They come in and make the Cross gesture with their hand, wash their hands in what I assume is holy water, and head right into the church, clearly well familiar with ""what to do"".  Is there a standard ""to do list"" for a Catholic visitor to a church?

(If it helps, churches we visited were St. Peter's Basilica, St. Maria Maggiore, and St. Clement's Basilica)

Thanks in advance if anyone can help me understand better and answer a question or two - and I very much apologize if I have used any incorrect words or terminology, I don't mean to offend.  And, of course, thank you Catholics for welcoming visitors to your beautiful churches!

I don't really know any of you, but I want to tell you, why I am and always will be Catholic. So can I vent off to you guys? (I'm new to reddit)

Please bear with me as I type my thoughts at 3 a.m. English is my third language. So hopefully I can stay on topic and explain myself well.   
I was born in Iraq, where 99% of the population is Muslim. My family worked very hard to create a life for themselves in Iraq. I'm chaldean/Assyrian, we're the indigenous people of mesopotamia. 
All my friends (except a couple) were muslims. I grew up during Iraq's poorest years due to the many sanction by the U.S. Which basically meant the government can only import essential food. So for e.g. because my family was well-off (thanks to my grandfather r.i.p) we could afford to get bananas on christmas/holidays, and let me tell you I remember enjoying every single bite and slowly eating it to savor the flavor, that sh*t was like caviar for little me. Sorry I got off topic again... 
tbc in a few minutes...

http://imgur.com/mnfbaqz I'm realizing how hard it is to type this from my fraternity house...

I guess I was trying to say is that I had the best childhood. the best. 
When middle school came along I had a few incidents where kids from school would say things and ask why aren't you converting to Islam?  some would say you christians worship the idols in your churches etc. I remember my middle school teacher (she taught Islam, which is a required class taken by all muslim students every semester. And it's a study hall for christian students) would try to buy me snacks so I would stay in and learn about Islam, But I never did. Despite all the bad experiences with religion throughout middle school, It wasn't all that bad, I have great memories with friends who treated me like a brother.  
Looking back, I think I was proud to be Catholic, but I hated being different, I never felt at home. I felt like a foreigner in my own land. Other than that I LOVED being apart of a small community. The Church in Iraq is usually more involved in people's lives than here in the U.S. In Iraq when you hear the word catholic, it's usually associated with help/love/work/feeding ANYONE who needed help. I remember I used to see old muslim women with burkas coming in and praying passionately (to whoever they were praying to). Just to be clear the moral of the story is church was a place for anyone to come and talk to God. I guess a sociologist would call it a case of ""model minority.""
....

I'm gonna fast forward  to college, so I can start talking about Catholicism and not bore you with my life story. I can do an AMA if u guys have any questions.
 So now I'm in the U.S. (http://i.imgur.com/jTE4KEG.jpg) in college. I'm in a fratertnity I lived in the fraternity house and had many friends and a great social life. I was doing everything any college kid wants. But to be honest, I wasn't satisfied. I was thirsty and craving something, but I didn't know how to quench my thirst. Sometime in my early teens something was awaken inside me, but I've ignored it for years. But now I couldn't ignore it anymore. I started looking at all religions. At this time, I've started to drift away from catholicism. My teacher in HS talked about how evil the catholic church was. By now I have been influeced by the news, the internet, schools, college have changed what I thought of when I heard the word Catholic. Now when I hear the word catholic three things come to mind 1. Pedophilia 2. abortion 3. homophobia. Yep... the word sure did change since I left Iraq. Time has taken it's toll, now I've become embarassed to be catholic, and I had enough. So I sopped considering myself catholic so I considered myself just christian (even changed it on fb, so it was facebook official). From there I started leaning toward agnosticism, easiest way out. I can still be 'deep' (http://imgur.com/HVcOnWi) yet I wont have to defend anything. Then A little over a year ago, I went to a little get together picnic at some family friends. I started chatting with a Greek Orthodox Catholic Priest, father Greg. He's very well spoken, very spiritual and easy to talk to. I swear you could sit there for hours and just listen to this man talk. He had a wife and a son, which was very starnge for me. Anyways before leaving, he said something along the lines of ""I'm glad you're questioning yourself, it's an important part of your life."" and told me to look up a book by Thomas Aquinas and other catholic philosophy. My mind was blown... TBC

*       Hey new friends! I'm sorry, and I feel bad for not finishing up my post after all the support I received from all of you. But I'm literally having the worst day of my life. I have ignored a really serious problem for a while, and now it finally caught up to me and I'm facing the music. 
I've had a rough life and I've have seen/experienced shit from living in a  war zone, but this has mentally wore me down. Once I get through this day(hopefully) I'll come back with more enthusiasm than ever.

We haven't always been there for each other, and there were rocky times, but at 20 I just feel too young to be losing him. 

In July, he went to the ER with trouble breathing and they found stomach cancer. He had chemo and everything seemed to be getting better. He was gaining weight and going back to work (self employed) some days. We weren't speaking frequently over the past few months because his girlfriend hates his whole family and has brainwashed him. Anyway, we received a call last night from a drunk employee that works with his girlfriend, saying that he's been in the hospital since Thursday. After some calls, we find out that the cancer has spread to his brain. 

According to his nurse, it's a matter of a few days. I don't think it's right for me to pray for God not to take him at 59, but I find myself doing it anyway. I know God has a plan for him, and I have been praying and praying that God take care of him and help him pass without pain.

The post can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ozxfs/my_friend_angela_at_a_prolife_rally/). I'm sorry if this post isn't welcome here, I just feel like I have no voice anywhere but the Catholic Church.

Why am I told this all the time? How am I somehow less of a woman because I believe that conception means life and that no one has the right to take a life from another? Shouldn't we celebrate the fact that as a woman I have the freedom to express myself without fear of serious, and in some parts of the world deadly, ramifications instead of concentrating on what that opinion actually is?

Let me start off by saying that I hate--no, despise is a better word--the terms ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"". They are slogans designed to inspire an emotional response from people and they imply that if you are one, you can't be the other. The majority of people are both pro-life and pro-choice--no one is arguing that life isn't sacred, that death is somehow superior to life, and no one is arguing that women shouldn't have a voice or choices. So why do we use those terms?

I believe in freedom, I believe in choices, but I also believe that all life is sacred. For some reason, having this opinion gives people the impression that I am ""anti-woman""; for some reason, it has become a social norm for people to say that I am less than woman because I don't think abortion is right. Somehow, me being against ending a pregnancy is the same thing as restricting a woman's freedom to do with her body as she chooses. The same people that accuse me of attempting to suppress women are doing just that when they try to silence my opinion and threaten my femininity for disagreeing with them.

I am not less of a woman because I am anti-abortion. I am not ""anti-choice"" because I feel it is immoral to end a pregnancy. I am not against women because I think adoption is the better option. The people that say they are standing up for women's rights so that we cannot define what a woman is or what she decides to do with her body are hypocritically attacking my womanness because I don't agree with them. They aren't trying to stop the world from defining and controlling women; they're trying to force their own definition of womanness on the rest of us.

So go ahead and threaten my femininity. Try to change my beliefs with bully tactics and threats that my opinions will somehow make me unwoman. The fact of the matter is that I am exercising what all feminists claim to fight for--the right to have a voice, the right to fight for what you believe in, and the right to be the woman I want to be.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_p083s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/p083s/antichoice_is_antiwoman/,

As such, they were very near the finish line.  Hearing of the incident on the news, he was very concerned for the well-being of his parents.  He then, later, sent out this in an email to let everyone know they were okay.  Here is an excerpt...

My question is about the line I italicized below.

""Once emergency officials arrived he continued searching for my mother.  30 minutes later, they were reunited, both unscathed.  This whole time, my family was praying for their safety.  *Sure enough, God was looking over us, as he always is.*""

No doubt, God was looking over them.  But, he looks over everyone.  This just got me thinking about those whose loved ones didn't fare as well as my friend's parents.  For instance, let's say it was my parents, and my dad was waiting for my mom, only to find out 30 minutes later that her leg was blown off, or worse that she had died.  I can only conclude that God was looking over us also.

I know this gets to the point of being thankful to God for all things.  And that the injuries sustained are the result of people's free will and sin, and that God will use all situations for good.

But, what would be a more appropriate prayer in a time when you fear someone is in danger?  Should you pray that they are okay, and come out unscathed.  Or, should you pray ""Thy will be done"" and for the strength and courage to accept it, no matter what?  Or, maybe the answer isn't either or, but both.

I think I just answered my own question, as I just remembered this verse...*“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”* - Luke 22:42

But, since I typed it all out, I wouldn't mind hearing what anyone has to say.

During the homily, I kind of zoned the priest out and was struck with an epiphany of sorts. When was the last time I enjoyed church as much as those girls in front of me? When was the last time the music moved me? They weren't snapping their fingers or clapping--just moving.

While the vocal, anti-theistic practice slowed down as the years went, my beliefs were always strong and steadfast that I was correct that I had truly found truth in science and what I scientifically knew to be true.

During this period, I successfully tore my protestant wife away from her beliefs and she is now agnostic.  I also had a child, who I was intent on raising secular and knowing the truths science has to offer, and not filling his head with religion.  Then my mindset changed.  It was sudden and scared the hell out me (no pun intended).  It took a while for me to figure out where my change came from.  Initially, regaining a desire for the Church was harder than leaving, because I thought, ""I've already been through the questioning phase; I've had my religious journey and come out the other end!""  I could not under stand why, seemingly out of nowhere, I felt called to return to Mass and the Eucharist.  

A few months prior to this, my grandmother passed away.  She was devout in her Catholicism, and never turned away from Christ.  Her funeral was a full Catholic Mass, and the first one I'd been to in almost 6 or 7 years.   It was held in our dioceses Basilica, which obviously comes with the all beauty and gothic like structure that the Church is known for.  I think this is what set me on my road back to the Church.  

The more I reflected, the more I remembered how positive my experience was with the Church growing up, and the more I began to get overrun with guilt thinking I would be denying my son the same experience I was fortunate enough to have.  Being the nerdy redditor I am, I knew I had a great option at my disposal.  I'd already been lurking here, so I made an anonymous throwaway account and asked for advice.  

The response to that was almost overwhelming.  It took a few weeks (longer than what I said in that thread) but I went to confession a last week, and immediately followed with a weekday morning mass.  I went  to another weekday mass this morning, and will be taking my son (3 years old) this Sunday.  

My wife, while still completely confused about my sudden transformation, is supportive of me taking our son.  While she has no immediate plans of attending RCIA, she has agreed to come with us also.  I wont be pressuring her, and with her protestant background, she doesn't understand the beauty of the sacraments that Catholics, and even a lot of ex Catholics, do.  I'm just happy she's coming.

I'll be honest that the beauty of the Church, the liturgy and traditions that are what I'm missing.  I still struggle quite a bit with a true, Gnostic belief in God.  During my confession, my priest said the struggles are what make faith what it is, and working through that is our cross.  I hope as time comes on, I begin to feel the holy spirit in the way I once did.  Struggles in theology aside, I feel like I am at home again, and I believe things will fall into place as time goes on.

Thank you again to the people that replied to my original post.  I will try to be more active on this subreddit.

Religion was a big part of my life and even at a young age I really internalized the religious teachings I learned at school. I prayed all the time and felt God's presence with me. 

Fast forward to eighth grade, for various reasons I began attending public school (which was a very good turn of events for me in the social sense) and quickly things began to fall apart. My mother was a teacher at my Catholic school, but not a Catholic herself so she did not take me to church on sundays. My father who was actually the ""official Catholic"" of the two of them was basically lapsed and never went to church either. Add into this a lot of exposure to atheists/agnostics and my faith began to drift.

From about the age of thirteen or so I'd started to have doubts about the existence of God. I started to see believing in God as feeble-minded , and thought that science and logic rationally dispelled any kind of ridiculous notion of a higher power or afterlife. By the time I was seventeen, I formally called myself an atheist.

Up until yesterday, that is. Earlier this week I was riding my bike around the neighborhood, and passed a Catholic church with a board out front- the message of the week was ""return to me with your whole heart"".  It stirred a deep emotion in me, and I puzzled over it on the ride home, of course telling myself that the feelings I were having had nothing to do with me feeling God, or wanting to believe in God. However, yesterday out of the blue I was struck by the urge to attend mass. Lucky for me there was a mid-day service, I went, and it was like coming home. I broke down crying afterward, not really knowing what had come over me. Thinking ""what if I believe in God? What if I wanted to be Catholic again?"" . All kinds of worries filled my head- would my friends still accept me? Would people see me as a flip-flopper? Would God have me?

I think that a big part of it for me is that for the last eight years I've associated God and Jesus with the evangelicals I seem to come across so often, who are anti-intellectual, narrow-minded, and seem to view questioning one's faith as the biggest insult to God there is. However, I know there must be another side to it. My problem now is that my brain still wants to shoot down all notions I might have of believing in God with logic. I really don't know how to proceed, I would really like to feel the presence of God again, if I can believe there is a presence to be felt.  Any help you can give me would be welcome.

When it was time for me to enter school, my parents took me to test for a private Christian (non-Catholic) institution.  I was not admitted to the school.  I was sad that they did not want me.  My parents sent me to a public school for kindergarten and decided they would try again for private school the following year.  If I had got into the first school, I would not have applied for Catholic school the next year.

I made it in to this one, and stayed for my elementary and junior high years.  As I got older, I noticed that our school did not have state of the art equipment and was often low on money.  I would sometimes wish that I went to another school with greater material wealth.  If I my wish had been granted, I never would have seen the flyer for an all boys Catholic summer camp.

If had not seen the flyer, I would not asked my parents to go.  When I was away at the camp I wished that I was not the only boy from my school who was attending.  I wondered what might friends were doing at home with their summers and how I might enjoy that more.  If I was not there, I would not have fallen in love with the Norbertine priests running the program and their abbey.

If I did not love that abbey, I would not have begged my parents to go to the on site boarding school.  When I was at the school I was sometimes homesick.  I missed my family, my friends, television, and girls.  Early on I even once asked my mom if I could leave mid-year.   She said no.

If she had not denied my request, I would not have graduated from that high school.  I would not have spent those formative years learning from the priests.  I would not have looked at my life and wanted something more.  I would not have looked back fondly at my time at the abbey and made the decision to enter the seminary.

I was accepted into the seminary and began studying to be a priest.  I began to think that I might not have a priestly vocation and with the help of my superior discerned that I did not.  I was frustrated with the time I had spent working towards a goal that was no longer in sight.  I was embarrassed to be returning home and see all the people I had said goodbye to forever.  I had given away most of what I owned and was in need of an income.

If I was not in such need, I would not have taken a job that was below my qualifications.  If I had not taken that job, I would not have been quickly promoted.  Despite that early promotion, I felt like I was stuck.  I applied for various other positions but didn’t get them.  Each time I was more and more disappointed.  If I had got any of those positions  I would not have met John.

If I had not met John we would not have become friends and spent time outside of work.  If we had not been out with him one night I would not have met Pamela, who knew John’s wife.  We would not have been married one year later and we would not have a beautiful daughter.

My stance on the issue has always been throwing my hands in the air and saying I trust the Church's teaching, and so I would not say I have rebelled in any way. But I still want to be fully in line with the Church with my whole belief system, and to do that I must fully reconcile my thoughts on the sanctity of marriage.

I know our church is against divorce, but it seems like for an issue that literally destroys families, the Church is not as active in fighting it. While there are plenty of groups that exist to maintain the illegality of gay marriage, I have yet to find a group that exists that is fighting to make divorce illegal. I have seen countless Catholic seminars in my area advertising discussions on the Church and gay marriage, but not once have I seen a divorce discussion. Not even support groups for families victimized by divorce (I'm hoping those exist, but they don't seem as common as they should be). It just doesn't seem like the Church is fighting hard to make divorce illegal, but for the topic of gay marriage we are ceaselessly up in arms. 

I think I can form a more consistent view on the sanctity of marriage once I have some closure on marriage issues outside of homosexuality. Could you guys offer me some insights?

Sharing an experience, asking for your help.",hairyotter,42,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/w8f6i/struggles_with_chastity_sharing_an_experience/,"Hey bunch of people that I do not know, and maybe some that I do, just had an interesting experience that I’d like to share, and maybe it will help some others as well.


Like most young men I have known, I have problems with chastity. I do a pretty good job of hiding it. While it certainly has “improved” since high school days, it definitely still rears its ugly head, mostly finding its way to the surface in the forms of pornography and masturbation.


Yesterday I went to one of the “worst” confessions in my life; I just moved, and this is the first time I’ve been to this church and confessed to this priest. Honestly, he seemed pretty rude. He cut me off a few times, sighed, and even one time (when I rambled a bit) he asked me bluntly “So what exactly are you trying to confess here?” in an impatient tone. I was pretty surprised and kind of uncomfortable. He took this blunt tone further- when it came to confessing my sins of impurity, this is how our conversation went:


    “You know that this is a serious sin, don’t you?”

    “Yes, Father.”

    “And I am sure that this is not the first time you have confessed it.”

    “No, Father.”

    “And I am sure that other priests have given you advice on how to fight this sin, haven’t they?”

    “Yes, Father.”

    “And have you been following that advice to your best ability?”


Here I was stuck, because I wanted to tell him that I’ve tried, that I did my best, that I did all that I could do, but honestly, I knew deep down that that wasn’t really true. I’m a pretty lazy guy and it is one of those kind of things that “just happens”, isn’t it? But he didn’t even give me the chance to answer because after a quarter-second of silence he added:


    “That’s right, you haven’t.”

    “….(pretty harsh, I thought)…”

    “So what exactly are you doing here? Look, I’m not going to say it is easy, and I am not going to say that God does not forgive you, but you need to understand that when you sit right there and confess, you are promising that you will do everything you can do to not sin again. You need to consider whether you take that promise seriously.”

    “Yes, Father.”


Honestly, it felt like a slap to the face. It hurt. I’ve never been called out like that. I’ve never been that uncomfortable, and even a bit embarrassed. But with sin, especially habitual sin, maybe that is what I needed.


Just felt a desire to share this experience, because in the end, it was liberating. It cut through my excuses and my rationalizations, and made me pissed off, first at the priest but then more reasonably at myself for my sins (and isn’t that what confession is supposed to do?).


So I am asking for your help, first, for your prayers, but also in a more tangible way, a commitment— I’m looking for accountability partners, and if you are in a similar boat as me, maybe you could use one too. We are all busy people for sure, but checking in once a week would be awesome, and a cool way I think for us to help one another out.


My cat’s out of the bag. I think that has always been the hardest thing to do, just come out and say it straight, because I think most people who know me don’t think of me as someone who ever has to struggle with this kind of thing. Maybe that is you as well, or maybe you are suffering from the fact (as I have also experienced) that Catholic peers just don’t really like to talk about this kind of thing. Well, I’m not hiding anymore, and it feels better than I thought it would. Maybe I can help you get yourself out of that hole as well. Send me a quick PM with your email. Do it now, before you change your mind. No explanation necessary, just say “I’m in.” Let’s help each other out.

I think in many ways the casual limitation of the scope of the word is doing harm.

When someone mentions that we're having a ""vocation-crisis"" in the Church, I whole-heartedly agree. But that doesn't just mean a shortage of priests, it's a shortage of men and women willing to answer the demands of love. There is indeed a vocation crisis for the married vocation as well. Just as husbands and wives are failing left and right to love each other fully, so does the priesthood fail to grow with men teaming to give themselves as a sacrifice to the beloved.

At the root, I think we need to focus less on convincing Catholic men to be open to the priesthood, and instead finding new ways for men and women to realize they live for 'the other' and not for themselves. To really investigate the intimidating demands of love.

Is this a concern anyone shares?",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1ipbr8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1ipbr8/a_topic_id_like_to_discuss_vocation_religious_life/,

A friend of mine is heading into an **unexpected, emergency surgery** and is in desperate need of prayers. I thought I'd put in a request to my fellow Catholics (I've already said the rosary!). My friend is having major issues with her insides--maybe there's a saint for that?!

Please pray for my friend, who is like a sister to me. She's a recent college grad, trying to make it out on her own, and then this happens. She's very scared and could use God's grace and peaceful presence right now.

Thanks in advance for your prayerful charity.

Thank you SO MUCH for all of your prayers. **Alexis** (that's her name for those of you who asked!) is not out of the woods yet -- apparently there is an infection; she needs to remain hospitalized, and the procedure cannot be finished til the infection goes away.

***EDIT 2:*** I have no idea if anyone is still checking this... but I wanted to update just in case. Doctors are worried about the infection spreading, so they've left her with an open wound. She will remain hospitalized until Thursday, and by then they will hopefully be able to suture. *Please* continue to pray!

WHY SHOULD I BE CATHOLIC?
---

* Why is a priesthood needed to confess one's sins? What is the Catholic ""beef"" with the priesthood of all believers?

* The Holiness of Mary and ""co-redemptrix"": how and why is this justified? Why do so many of the declared infallible dogmas have to do with Mary?

* Do any of you feel some Church teaching is less strictly biblical and more strictly Aristotelian (i.e. transubstantiation)? I mean I get the concept of the ""real presence"" but why must it be defined as it was by the undoubtedly Greek-philosophically-influenced Aquinas? (i.e. with talk about ""essences"" and other Greek ideas)

* What is the Catholic response to the idea the Pope was the ""first among equals"" and not the ""final say in all things"", so to speak, earlier in the Church's history?

*  Cardinals: where did they come from? I see Bishops in early Church history and in Holy Scripture, but not Cardinals. Now they all appear to be Bishops but this was not always the case.

* And, finally, free for all: Why would it be better for me to be a Catholic as opposed to a Protestant?

We immediately started trying to have a child, and after a year and a half of only conceiving once (which resulted in an 8 week miscarriage), we sought fertility help. We are out of funds and it hasn't worked.

This week, I have been emotional support for a friend who has had her fourth abortion, I have sent a gift to my friend having her fifth child, and I have a friend who just announced she is pregnant with her first child, though the father has decided to not be in the picture. The icing on this cake was a post on /r/Christianity about a young woman who had an abortion when she was a teenager. One comment in particular set me over the edge this morning:

&gt; Adoption was never an option for me. There was no way that I could carry my child to term, then give it up to someone else. I didn't give it a second thought.

My husband and I are currently waiting to be matched with a child under the age of 18 months. This sentiment cut me deep. So, so deep. This mentality that people have that if they can't have their child, then no one can, is what has helped to make our estimated wait time for a baby to be 5-7 years. I'm finding it harder and harder to sympathize with people who have abortions and I really can't take it much longer.

It's been a tough week for me. I haven't been to church in weeks because it's just so damn difficult for me to sit in those pews and see people holding their children or having parishioners smile at me and ask when we will be having one of our own and not feel resentful towards God. I read every day about childless couples in the Bible, and while it used to help, it has only ended up making me resentful recently.

I try to handle this as best as I can, but with my Napro treatment failing, and my inability to afford the treatment anymore (insurance didn't cover it, so it all came out of pocket), there is nothing left to do. I'm having trouble finding any beauty in my faith. I know (I hope) it's just a passing storm, but God does it hurt. Especially this week, where it feels like God is just laughing at me now.

Edit: The overwhelming support of this community has literally brought me to tears. I have read each and every comment, and honestly, I spent a lot of time in prayer yesterday. My husband and I spoke, God and I spoke, and I feel like I'm in a better place today. Many of you are right: I should count the blessings I do have instead of focusing on those I don't. God loves me and wants what is best for me, even if it doesn't feel like it and even if I don't like what that is right now. He's not out to hurt me. I really want to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt more loved than I do right now.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,1353160040.0,,,True,t3_13aw0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/13aw0c/im_in_a_losing_battle_with_my_faith_right_now/,

If you haven't thoroughly read this, you really have no place supporting the LCWR against the Vatican. This isn't a case of the Vatican strong arming an innocent group of nuns. This is a case of the Vatican very charitably letting this group know that the things happening are leading people astray. 

I mean for goodness sake, the Vatican compliments the nuns several times in the assessment. Yet because the media has spun this in such a manner and because the rebelling of the leaders of this organization we have many confused Catholics who haven't read the assessment and are confused.

This is Chapter 1 of [My Daily Bread](http://www.confraternitypb.org/books.html) from the Confraternity of the Precious Blood.

**CHRIST:**

MY CHILD, the highest goal of your life is union with Me in Heaven.  Let your intentions throughout the day be guided by this truth.  In all things be sure to stay on the path which leads to Heaven.  Do not become too deeply interested in the passing desires and brief enjoyments of this earthly life. 

I have given you everything that you are and everything you have.  All things come to you from Me, the Supreme Good.  Whatever comes, accept it, use it, enjoy it, as I wish and as much as I wish.

If you think only of satisfying yourself, without considering My approval, your mind becomes confused and your will becomes weak.  Mistakes and sins will rob you of peace on earth and of unending happiness in Heaven.  In all things, therefore, keep your eyes on Me. 

Happy are those who desire only what I want, trying steadily to do My Will.  Such people do not let themselves become completely absorbed by their daily activities.  They frequently offer their activities to Me.  They see the brevity of human contentment on earth.

Examine your motives in your daily words and actions.  Find out how you may please Me more, and avoid everything which may draw you away from Me.

**THINK:**

I was created for eternal happiness with God in Heaven.  Everything else must take second place in my life, because if I lose Heaven, I will be losing everything.  The sure guide to Heaven is God’s holy Will.  If I follow it in me daily life, every moment on earth will be a sure step toward the perfect happiness which my heart craves. 


**PRAY:**

My God and loving Father, grant me the wisdom to think, speak, and act each day as You want me to.  May I never be such a fool as to disagree with Your supreme goodness and wisdom.  Nothing on earth can bring me any lasting happiness.  Therefore, let me never sin for the sake of anything.  I want to live for the perfect happiness for which you created me.


Amen

Ever since I've been at university I've become increasingly involved at the Catholic center on campus, even taking on a position as a leader/planner of various events and ministries here.  Hell, I live here, the Catholic Church is about ten feet from my door, and my landlord is my priest.  I've also been studying religion (academically) and philosophy, and have set the goal of pursuing a graduate degree in Catholic Studies and serving the Church in some way with that, perhaps teaching at Catholic universities.  So yeah, it was only a matter of time before someone told me ""hey, have you ever thought about becoming a priest?""

It was my good friend and roommate, who is going to seminary next fall.  And really, this subject isn't something that scares me or that I'm running from, it is just something that I haven't felt the call to do.  I love and admire the priesthood--I even envy seminarians some days, because they will be studying nearly exactly what I will be except in an awesome and holy environment, and with the Church paying the bill.  The thing is that I admire priests the same way I admire National Geographic photographers--I respect so highly what they do, and even sometimes imagine myself in their shoes, but I recognize in myself that I am not *for* a position as a NatGeo photographer.  I see in myself that I wouldn't fit the lifestyle.  And the same with priesthood.  I consider myself open to the possibility, and would take great pride in serving the Church in that way--but I haven't *felt* that.  I would need an extraordinary sign or change to occur in my life to begin to think that is my calling.  As it is, things seem to be going very well.  I am happy in my studies, happily two years into the most respectful and loving relationship of my life, and unless something drastic occurs to change my life, I am happy to follow the path I am currently on and see where it leads.

The thing is that this roommate of mine pointed to all the things I have been gradually coming into--leaving photojournalism for Religious Studies and philosophy, becoming a leader in my faith community, giving everything I have to the kids who come through the Catholic youth camp I work at in summers--and pointed out how they all seemed to be leading me into a place for religious discernment.

I think I just needed to put this out there for you all to comment about, to see what you all think.  I know you folks don't know me on a personal level, and maybe you don't feel like you can say much, but I'd like to hear some kind words.  Honestly I remain pretty darn sure that I am called to serve the Church as laity, and that my relationship is going somewhere for a reason.  I have often prayed that God would help me come into my vocation, and if it was his will to bless my relationship with this young woman--and if not, to help us prepare each other for our true vocations.  I have taken the success of this relationship as a sign that I should, certainly at the present time, continue to devote myself to that.  I have also considered often, that if this relationship didn't pan out after me basically giving all I had to it, and all the success we've enjoyed this far, that I would take *that* as a sign that I should begin giving myself over to priesthood discernment.

Well, there you go, a novel by yours truly.  It is past 4:00 AM, and even though I remain convinced of my call to laity and perhaps even marriage, I feel like I have a lot to think about in light of that conversation with my roommate.  Make out of it what you will.

Love you all,

1365516176.0,41,self.Catholicism,1bzmbc,Promotion of Homosexual Marriage Can Constitute the Promotion of Grave Sin,KnightGalahad,83,42,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1bzmbc/promotion_of_homosexual_marriage_can_constitute/,"The discussion yesterday regarding Mr. Peters's statement that a Catholic who promotes homosexual marriage should not receive communion was informative and challenging.  However, I think the focus was lost in part.  Forgive me that I did not read all the comments.  I know a few of you did maintain your focus with Yoda-like intensity.  

My understanding of Mr. Peters's conclusion is that it flows from the premise that a Catholic who affirmatively promotes the commission of grave sin is himself in a state of grave sin.  Here is the key part of his analysis:

&gt;Catholics who promote “same-sex marriage” act contrary to Canon 209 § 1 and should not approach for holy Communion per Canon 916. Depending on the facts of the case, they also risk having holy Communion withheld from them under Canon 915, being rebuked under Canon 1339 § 2, and/or being sanctioned under Canon 1369 for gravely injuring good morals.

Canon 209  § 1 states:  ""The Christian faithful, even in their own manner of acting, are always obliged to maintain communion with the Church.""  

Canon 916 states:  ""A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to celebrate Mass or receive the body of the Lord without previous sacramental confession unless there is a grave reason and there is no opportunity to confess; in this case the person is to remember the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition which includes the resolution of confessing as soon as possible.""

Canon 1339, section 2:  ""He can also rebuke a person whose behavior causes scandal or a grave disturbance of order, in a manner accommodated to the special conditions of the person and the deed.""

Canon 1369 states:   ""A person who in a public show or speech, in published writing, or in other uses of the instruments of social communication utters blasphemy, gravely injures good morals, expresses insults, or excites hatred or contempt against religion or the Church is to be punished with a just penalty.""

Peters goes on to give a similar analysis regarding Catholics who promote or assist an actual attempt at a homsexual marriage:

&gt;Catholics who assist others toward attempting a “same-sex marriage” cooperate in the bad act of those others, which cooperation is liable to moral assessment in accord with the usual principles applicable to cooperation with evil and, under certain facts, according to the canonical principles applying to cooperation in crime per Canon 1329 and/or scandal per Canon 1339 § 2, etc.  

My understanding of his analysis is that from a Catholic moral standpoint the promotion of homsexual marriage and the active assistance in an attempt of such marriage are equivalent because they result in a break with communion with the Church through the promotion of error and promotion of the immoral acts of others.

A question on veneration of Mary (and saints),God_loves_redditors,36,2,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1glhsh/feeling_a_pull_towards_catholicism_from/,"Hey all. I was raised protestant but I see a lot of beauty in the Catholic church and was trying to analyze what was holding me back from possibly joining the Catholic church. Surprisingly, there are relatively fewer issues nowadays then when I was younger. A lot of misconceptions have been cleared up by some great catholic users in /r/Christianity

Some background to the question: I realize that Catholics do not worship Mary, but rather 'venerate' her. I appreciate that the church teaches that Mary is not to be worshiped. However, I still have DEEP unease about the attention given to Mary (in a sense relative to the attention given to Christ). I know that any Catholic, when asked, would of course say that Christ is more important, but when observing Catholic practices and iconography I get this feeling in the pit of my stomach like something is 'off'. Like, even though Christ has most of the focus, the ratio of Christ focus to Mary/Saints focus is a little too close to even for my liking.

Ok so after that long-winded paragraph, my actual question: If I were to become Catholic, how much veneration must I, personally, give to Mary? I affirm her statement in the Magnificat that she is blessed and experienced incredible favor from God in that she was entrusted with carrying and raising the Son of God. On the other hand, I understand that in confession, a priest may ask me to pray to her (say Hail Marys?) as part of penance. This sets off all sorts of alarm bells for me. I've been assured by my catholic brethren that praying to Mary is not worship but is just asking her to pray for you. Do I HAVE to pray to Mary for penance? Can I ask the priest for ""Our Father's"" instead?",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1glhsh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1glhsh/feeling_a_pull_towards_catholicism_from/,

 I was never religious at all growing up, and didn't think about it much until a few years ago when I started college. Many things didn't (and still don't) make sense to me about any sort of God. I went to a Mass a few times with my Catholic girlfriend and tried to talk to her about things but she could still never convince me about it very well. She always said that if you're looking from the outside, it doesn't make sense. But if you're looking from the inside, you can't explain it. This never sat right with me, I didn't understand how you can believe in something this immense and not be able to explain it to others. But that never mattered much because we were in love and I thought that that would prevail over all. 



So we had been having unprotected sex for a couple years using the pull out method and then of course she got pregnant. We were both very excited at first. But her parents seemed pretty disappointed with her and I think that along with being visibly pregnant walking around college campus at 20 made her feel ashamed. After she had the baby I could tell she was slowly pulling away from me. We had long since stopped having sex but she would no longer kiss me goodbye or tell me that she loved me anymore.
 


Finally she talked to me about everything and said that she was just being a Cafeteria Catholic and how everything we did was wrong and that she didn't want to be with me because she could no longer see us getting married because I didn't believe in God.



This really hurt me because I never wanted her to feel hurt or let down. And I was always planning on marrying her one day. And I guess that's what has brought me here. I know that the only way we could ever be together is if I convert. And I feel like I do belong with her because I still love her very much and want to be with her for the rest of my life. Ya know? I feel like there's gotta be something more and that this must have some meaning or I wouldn't still be feeling the way I feel about her.



I feel so lost. I can't understand why this would happen to me.. She has given me a couple books which I have read (one was about a surfing priest and the other was a gynecologist explaining Catholic marriage), she has also given me a scapular which I try to wear, but I feel nothing with it on. I've prayed many times trying to seek guidance or anything but I don't feel anything. I don't understand why nothing is happening when I'm trying to be so open.



I want to know how Catholicism makes sense to you and why you have faith in it. If you just want to tell me your story, or explain your reasoning, or tell me a book to read that would not only help me understand why there is a god, but why the Catholic version is correct would be appreciated.

tl;dr: try to explain to me why Catholicism is the truth, by whatever means.

**update:** I went to Barnes and Noble and bought The Case for Christ and Orthodoxy. I saw a few more that were mentioned in this thread and some others that looked interesting but I had to refrain for now for the sake of my sanity and my pay check.

Before I accepted Catholicism as my own faith, rather than just my parents', I spent a good deal of time contemplating and searching for Truth. (I am what some people might call a bit of an intellectual.) I studied philosophy, Buddhism, Judaism, sciences, psychology, history, and on and on and on.  I felt so lost, but always desperately yearned for Truth--I just wasn't sure what that meant.  I did not leave the faith, but I did sort of make it stand trial while I continued my investigation.

Then one Holy Week a few years ago,  I was sitting in my upper room alone with the lights off and the door locked (sounds familiar, right?) and I was watching the Passion of the Christ on my laptop (great movie!)  When it came to the scene where Jesus was on trial before Pontius Pilate, I was absolutely struck by how much of myself I saw in Pilate.  *Pilate!*  I felt embarrassed and ashamed that of all the wonderful people in the bible, *Pilate* was the one I identified with.  Like him, I felt as if I was questioning an innocent man when I was questioning my faith. I did not want to condemn him, I did not *want* to leave my faith, but so many people were around me pushing me to do so (""Crucify him! Crucify him!"") I was just so utterly *lost* in my search for Truth.  

Then there comes a point where Jesus says ""For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the Truth."" and Pilate replies **""Quid est veritas?""-- ""What is Truth?""** That just blew me away. I felt like I shared in his frustration and his cynicism.  I had before me a man, my faith, who many held to be a king among kings, a truly holy man; some even called him the Messiah and the Son of God (in the case of the Church, the Rock of Peter and the Bride of Christ.)  I even *liked* him, and saw no blame in him.  But all around me there was an angry crowd telling me how terrible he was, and how he deserved to die.  

Pilate makes his choice, and the rest is history.  But what about me?  Like Pilate, I was left with a choice--wash my hands of this man, my faith, and let the crowds do what they want to him, or investigate further his claim that he came to ""testify to the Truth.""   I chose the latter.  I chose to ask questions, to immerse myself in the faith and learn of its history.  I no longer sought Truth in some vague sense, I sought Truth in Christ--*and I found it!!*

A young devout Catholic sister, Angel de Maria, close to friends of mine in Veracruz, Mexico is in dire need of our support and help.

**Story**

She is a leader in a Christian university work in Veracruz. She is highly respected by many of her friends and known to be a faithful sister. She was traveling to see Pope Francis in Brazil with other sisters. She had to fly through Peru. In Peru she noticed that her passport was stolen, for which she was returned to Mexico City. She asked for her luggage to be sent back and they told her that the code had to change as well. In Mexico city they told her that her bag was lost.

Her father picked her up. Then the airlines brought them in, and presented them with her luggage. She DENIED that it was her luggage. They both went to pick some exchange and call by phone. Through the cellphone airlines authorities contacted her saying her bag was found again. She went back without her father. On the way, 10 policemen stop her, and put her in an enclosed room. They presented her with the same luggage. She again DENIED for a second time the ownership of the luggage, and asked for her real one. The police proceeded to open the luggage and they found 10 kilos of drugs.

Her father was also intercepted by police and asked the same questions.  The sister is currently going to a high security penitentiary facility in Mexico accused of Narcotics trafficking.

**Help and Support** 

The attempt is to reach national TV media in Mexico. Thousands of people are coming to her aid and support but the problem has not reached the proper attention needed. Please:

1. Prayer for our sister in Christ Angel de Maria. 
2. There is work for open letters to the public opinion and the government to ask for the release and for justice for Angel de Maria, and to find the proper culprits. 
3. Please also join the facebook page https://www.facebook.com/liberADMe1. 
4. Spread the message to any forums. All attention will help get her case properly heard.
5. Twitter hash tag: #LiberADMe
6. Try to let the Pope know.
 
 
**Note:** **Please upvote this** as this needs as many eyes as possible. I am not looking for Karma here, this is a self post. This is for a sister that needs help.

**Update 1:** Some **news sources** have started picking up the story. I will add them here as I find them:

* [Poster with her picture](http://imgur.com/632J729)
* http://www.elcomercio.com/mundo/Policias-antidrogas-aeropuerto-Lima-narcotrafico-drogas-cocaina_0_888511291.html
* http://yucatan.com.mx/mexico/derechos-humanos-mexico/veracruzana-iba-a-ver-al-papa-y-le-sembraron-droga
* The media director of the Archdiocese in Xalapa showing support for the sister and asking the authorities for a proper investigation: http://metropolitanoenlinea.com/?p=231743

**Update 2:**

It turns out that even though she had traveled with only ONE bag, on the way back the airline registered 11 bags under her name, without giving her notice. Where did the other 10 bags come from? It seems clear that Angel was a victim of a narcotics traffic network between Peru and Mexico.

As for more media outlets picking this up:

* The issue was broadcast on both Mexican nation wide TV stations' news shows. 
* CNN editors are investigating the issue and deciding if they are going to broadcast it. Pray so that their decision is enlightened.

**Update 3:**

The Federal Attorney General (I think that's the correct translation) of Mexico just announced that Angel de Maria will be freed in the next hours for obvious reasons and evidence in her favor!!!

Glory be to God!!!

Lets keep praying until she is back safe home with her parents.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,1374094095.0,,,True,t3_1ih69j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1ih69j/urgent_help_for_a_catholic_sister_angel_de_maria/,

""The men who discouraged the Israelites from going into the Promised Land told them that it was a country that ‘devoured its inhabitants.’ In other words, they said that the air was so malignant it was impossible to live there for long and its natives such monsters that they ate men like locusts. 

It is in this manner...that the world vilifies holy devotion as much as it can. It pictures devout persons are having discontented, gloomy, sullen faces and claims that devotion brings on depression and unbearable moods.

But just as Joshua and Caleb held both that the Promised Land was good and beautiful and that its possession would be sweet and agreeable so too the Holy Spirit by the mouths of all the saints and our Lord by his own mouth assure us that a devout life is a life that is sweet, happy, and lovable.""

---

I always find amusement and consolation in the fact that what we struggle with as devout Catholics is nothing new.  The Israelites, St. Francis de Sales, and we face the *same* issues - those steeped in secularism accuse the devout of never being happy, but rather of always carrying around an unnecessary burden of guilt.

1. Why is idolatry the opposite of faith? What is idolatry? P.13

1. What is the significance of a mediator between me and God? Why can’t I ‘access’ God alone? P.14

1. Is Jesus merely an object of my faith? What does faith in Jesus mean? P.18
1. Is my faith only a private matter? What is the importance of an ecclesial (church) form of faith? P.22

1. What happens what the faith is not true? Doesn’t it still at least motivate me? P.24

1. Why is love and truth inseparable? P.27

1. What ‘senses’ are required to acquire faith? Why are they attached to faith? P.30

1. Does saying that the faith is true mean it is totalitarian? Isn’t it intolerant? P.34a

1. Is faith against science? P.34b

1. What about non-believers? Are they simply ‘faithless’? P.35c

1. Is theology a futile human effort? What is the goal of theology? P.36

1. How can I be certain that the faith we believe in is authentic? How do I know the Jesus I am told of is the real Jesus?  P.38-39

1. Why are the sacraments necessary to transmit the faith? Don’t ideas, teachings, only need repetition of the contents? P.40b

1. Why are infants baptized? P.43

1. Isn’t the creed only a set of abstract truths unrelated to my own self? P.45

1. Aren’t the Ten Commandments only a set of rules forbidding many things? P.46b

1. Aren’t there some people who know a deeper, fuller, teaching of Jesus? P.47c

1. Why must I profess the whole set of doctrines of the faith? Can’t I simply reject one or a few? P.48

1. Does God do anything so that the faith is integrally transmitted? P.49

1. Does faith make me withdraw from the world? What is the role of faith to the common good? P.51

1. How does faith make me appreciate mankind and nature more? P.54b

1. How is suffering related to my faith, and to other people who suffer? P.56-57a

1. In whom is fulfilled the long history of faith of the Old Testament, with its account of so many faithful women, beginning with Sarah?

Just for you to know, this are some facts about abortion in Spain, which is fully legal during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy since 2010:

* 47,265,321 inhabitants in 2012.
* 453,637 births in 2012 (-12.8% from 2008) – [[source]](http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20130618/numero-nacimientos-espana-cae-128-desde-empezo-crisis-2008/691181.shtml)
* **118,359 abortions in 2011** (+4.71% from 2010) – [[source]](http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20121221/numero-abortos-2011-aumento-47-respecto-ano-anterior/591602.shtml)

Note that the main cause of the declining birth rate is the economic crisis, but the number of abortions in relation to births is overwhelming. 

Right now more or less the **50% of population thinks the law has to be changed** [[source]](http://infocatolica.com/?t=noticia&amp;cod=17127) and the current conservative government promised a new more restrictive law, but a year later we're still waiting. The previous law defined some cases in which the abortion could be legal: malformations, risk to mother and rape. 

When the law was passed, the main opposition was the Catholic Church. In may 2013, 72.4% of population *is* Catholic, but **only 14.8% goes to mass** every sunday. [[source]](http://datos.cis.es/pdf/Es2987mar_A.pdf)

I'll admit I could have probably been more tender and gentle and less confrontational in some respects). Some of the things people say in regards to Catholicism really frustrate me, and it saddens me to know that there are so many people who profess the faith, yet know so little about it and make no effort to change that. I'll admit that there is much for me to learn, but at least (I think) I'm trying.


So please pray for these people, that they may put their arrogance and pride aside and take the time to truly reflect on the church, what she teaches, and why. May blessed Mary gently guide them to the Lord, and may Jesus overwhelm them with his mercy and love.


It's been a stressful day thinking about all this, but one thought in particular gave me comfort. Inside of me, there is a flame that is my love for God and God's love for me. I shouldn't go around trying to cover the mouths of those who try and blow it out. I should grow my flame to be so immense that no one can extinguish it, and that it grows the flames of those around me.

I believe that Jesus' death on the cross was atonement for my sin and now I have been redeemed and I have eternal salvation in Jesus Christ.

Romans 8:1-4
""Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death. For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."" (Romans 8:1-4 NIV)

Galatians 2:20-21
""I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!” (Galatians 2:20, 21 NIV)

Ephesians 2:4-10
""But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."" (Ephesians 2:4-10 NIV)

Do Catholics believe the same? If so, why are things like confession and communion necessary?

I come from a family of non-believers and I go to a Baptist College. I have never had exposure to Catholicism and I only know some basics. I have had this question for sometime and I figured this was the perfect place to ask! I'm not wanting to argue doctrine or anything, I am just curious as to what your beliefs are and why.

I had been struggling hard with a drinking problem, living on my own, starting back in school, and having my two year old daughter 80% of the time. I had enrolled in RCIA but had to quit because my daughter's mother wouldn't show up most of the time to watch her while I went to the classes. 

One day I was walking back from the liquor store in Uptown Minneapolis with some beer. I was in the middle of one of the most depressing and hopeless times of my life. As I was walking there was some old guy stumbling around crying out ""Help, I can't see!"" ""Someone  help me I can't see!"" Now Uptown Minneapolis isn't short on weird eccentric types so I didn't pay much attention. There were a lot of people around all completely ignoring this guy. The way he was saying he couldn't see was way over dramatic and seemed faked. I didn't believe he couldn't see. He was acting like someone from a scene in a bad ""B"" movie. For some reason I felt compelled to help this guy; I turned around and walked towards him.

""Do you need help getting somewhere?""

""Yes, please I can't see. I got off the bus on the wrong stop.""

""Ok, where do you need to go?""

""Just walk me up to the pizza place. I have some friends there and they can help me.""

Now, at the time, it never occurred to me to ask him how he knew that there was a pizza place (Dulano's) about three blocks up if he couldn't see. Needless to say, I didn't ask. I did think that I was probably being scammed in some way and remained on alert for our walk. He grabbed my arm and walked with me all the while blathering on about how he was lost and couldn't see. I got him to the pizza place and he asked me if I wanted to join him. I turned him down and said I had to get home. He grabbed me by the arm very tightly, startling me, looked right at me and said ""Jesus loves you very much!"" He turned, walked towards the door of the pizza place and went inside (all done very well for a guy who couldn't ""see"").

Scripture was interpreted seemingly arbitrarily and nothing was ever said to ""shock"" the audience, as it were -- they claimed that tithing was good because it led to greater material benefits, that it acted like a sort of ""spiritual investment scheme"" and that people who gave would actually earn more in a hard, material sense, for example.  On top of that, they would use pseudo-scientific evidence for the existence of God, like claiming that fish fossils on mountains proved the existence of the flood, or that the existence of monkeys disproves evolution, etc.

I lost religion by about middle school, because frankly I had never seen anything or any reasoning that presented a legitimate case for it.  I heard the pastor and the congregation exchange rumors and gossip behind each-other's backs, saw rich congregation members scoff at the idea of giving aid to the homeless, etc.

I started re-examining my atheism in college, in light of some of the philosophy courses that I had/have/am taken/taking, and essays that I had read, etc.  The more I read of Catholic philosophers, and particularly the those that spoke of the sort of God that Aquinas spoke of, the more sense it all made.  Things like the ""problem of evil"" no longer seemed too daunting when I reasoned through them, whereas previously such questions elicited complaints that I should not ask questions at all.  Moreover, I found in Catholicism something that seemed far too lacking in my Protestant experiences, namely consistency and tradition, but also an intellectual background that seemed more rich.

Suppose I can reason myself into the proposition that a God exists and is omnipotent, omnibenevolent, omnibenevolent, and is justice, truth, and love itself -- and I have seen this position defended quite thoroughly.  But how from there does one move toward the more specific dogmas of the faith, particularly ascetic values and specific rituals?  That is the bit that I have trouble with.

Notably, an account associated with Fr. Longenecker's blog ([/u/dlongenecker1](http://www.reddit.com/user/dlongenecker1)), simply posts links from the blog, using same title of the blog post. Perhaps this is done automatically (I would wager so, since posting happens regularly and the user account never has, as of this post, commented). There may be other accounts like this, but this one comes to mind as the most notable.

I am not sure if the moderators have addressed this issue already (apologies if a ruling has already been made), but I worry about the effect of this practice. Fr. Longenecker's blog is pretty mainstream in viewpoint (let's not nitpick that point). I wonder what happens when a blog on the extremities of the Catholic sphere begins to use the same tactic?

If these were posted by a human contributor to this reddit, I would not take issue. Signs of humanity can be as simple as a better headline, a self post with TL;DR, or whatnot. Signs of humanity can also be commenting along with those posting comments to your links.

**For these reasons, I propose then to ban overt automatic blog post links. This would require mod monitoring and blocking if the rule isn't adhered to.**

Thoughts? I won't bring up the issue more than this selfpost, and will continue to downvote things that I think contravene [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette),  but I think [/r/Catholicism](/r/Catholicism) would do well to warn and block accounts associated with this practice.

***EDITED TO ADD:*** [+21 hours]

With thanks due for clarifying the current situation, moderator [/u/Saint_Peter](http://www.reddit.com/user/Saint_Peter) has commented [below](http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/sqa4n/proposal_to_ban_automatic_blog_post_links/c4g8lw7) (emphasis mine):
&gt;I agree with pretty much everything people have been posting. Active users in the community should not be discouraged from posting their own blog posts, but spammers will be removed. In fact, there are quite a few blogs that have already been permanently banned, yet still submit links to their blogs which get put in the spam filter automatically. So, to some degree, this is already happening.

&gt;However, it's hard to catch all of them as they start popping up and submitting. **So, if you feel that a certain user has simply been spamming, please hit the report button under the submission instead of just downvoting. Otherwise I may miss it.**

Wrapping up the *sensum redditum* on the account in question, and this practice in general:

* [/u/dlongenecker1](http://www.reddit.com/user/dlongenecker1)'s links do contribute to good, solid, Catholic conversations
* most oppose the seeming link-and-ditch method (see: [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette))
* someone suggested an AMA here, which would serve two purposes: *verification* and *engagement*
* someone suggested [/u/dlongenecker1](http://www.reddit.com/user/dlongenecker1) be cut some slack because Fr. Longenecker a member of the clergy
* a few disliked that seemingly every blog post was linked (we are not a dumping ground)
* a few noted feeling conflicted: at what price an active community?
* plenty felt there was nothing wrong

**On a positive note:** While it is still unclear how automated [/u/dlongenecker1](http://www.reddit.com/user/dlongenecker1)'s postings are, the ***as-yet-unverified*** user account has now commented on a post! A hopeful sign, perhaps.

---

My (probably) final comment: The general feeling of the community and the like-it percentage (currently 85% of 40 votes) is that there is a good amount of support for banning of automated linking. Since it is still a manual process, please follow moderator's suggested plan above if any poster begins to cross the line.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,True,,,True,t3_sqa4n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/sqa4n/proposal_to_ban_automatic_blog_post_links/,

1315906883.0,33,self.Catholicism,ke2k2,My wife just told me she cheated on me.,distraught-and-lost,37,4,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/ke2k2/my_wife_just_told_me_she_cheated_on_me/,"I came home from work today and my wife told me she cheated on me on saturday night. She had went out dancing and drinking with her girlfriends and then meet up with a co-worker. She didn't arrive home until nearly seven in the morning. She originally told me she had just stayed out to sober up at work. In hindsight I know this seems obvious that this was risky behavior, even if she had only done exactly what she said but I trusted her and took her at
her word. I feel like such a fool.

Right now I don't know what to do. Everything feels surreal, like it's all a horrible dream. When she told me I felt like I was going to faint, I couldn't breathe and I just kept waiting for her to say it was just some sort of sick joke. 

It's been about 5 hours now and I can't sleep. I feel like I have the flu now. I think I have a fever but I have the chills, I feel lightheaded, nausatious, my mouth is dry and I have a terrible headache. 

I am also having terrible thoughts. I can't stop thinking about the actual sex act she did with him. I keep thinking about going and beating the hell out of him. I am also having fleetting thoughts of suicide. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to post this is the other reddits because I don't want advice from non Christians. I don't want to get divorced but I don't know how to handle this. My wife seems remorseful but the thought keeps going through my head that if I stay, it's like I'm telling her it's not a big deal. I wonder how I can ever trust her again. 

I just don't know what to do, what to say. Please pray for us. 

Where can we go for catholic marriage counseling? Has anyone else dealt with this? 

Edit; We are going to morning mass and to talk to the priest afterwards. I hope we can get through this.

2nd edit; 

My wife and I went to morning Mass and meet with the priest afterwards, went to confession and talked with him. He is going to find an appropriate counselor and he also said that just a week ago a couple told him that if any married couple was contemplating divorce because of infidelity to have them contact them. 

First, I want to thank everyone for the advice , thoughts and prayers. 

Secondly, this is a bit stream of consciousness so it may seem all over the place but I don't feel I can share if with anyone. 

As far as the cheating, it was not just a drunken mistake. She had been drinking but she has admitted to me that she had developed a crush on this person in the previous week or so and that very same night had discussed with another coworker that this man wanted to cheat with her. She told the other coworker she wouldn't do it but loved the attention. She meet up the the man with the intention of flirting and later left with him with intention of cheating. Literally the morning of the very day she went out at night, she brought up out of the blue that she loved me so much she didn't think she could leave me if I ever cheated on her. It wasn't just a situation she fell into. She put herself into a situation were she knew this was a possible outcome.

My wife has self esteem issues. I know this so I make a strong effort to compliment her, tell her she looks attractive. I never criticize her looks or call her names. Which is why it hurts so much that she wanted to go outside for validation. I compliment her for nearly a decade, emotionally support her and protect her feelings and someone she meet 2 works ago calls her a nice, attractive person and she tosses me aside for the simplest of pickup lines. It's emasculating. It's humilating. 

I am scared. I am heartbroken beyond anything I have ever felt. I know this sounds awful but when I came home and saw the look on her face, I know what she was going to say and in that brief time before she spoke I though ""please God, not this. Maybe she's going to tell me someone died but not this."" I feel ashamed that I still wish it had been a death in the family.

The priest told us that sometimes after cheating a marriage can be better than ever. I'd like to believe that. I WANT to believe that. But I don't believe that. Maybe I'm just too caught up in my emotions but I don't see how this is possible.

We've had marital difficulty before. When we first got together my now wife felt like she had to discuss the #'s of past sexual partners. I had none before her. She gave me the # and details about some of them (one night stand, dated for awhile, etc). I didn't ask (mostly because I was embarrassed about being a virgin, I was not a Catholic at the time or a practicing Christian, we converted a few years after we were married) but just though ""okay."" The problem was that slowly through our marriage she would mention things that were inconsistent with what she had told me before. Relationships changed, the # got bigger. I could have accepted that as being ashamed and wanting to protect my feelings, because she knew some of those details could be hurtful. But with her friends, she laughed about these stories and told details of her past she had never told me, details that she knew where humiliating. 

When this information came out, bit by bit, I became more and more depressed. I stopped going to Mass and was angry that God wasn't helping with my pain. I hated God for that and cursed his name everytime I had those depressing thoughts. We went to non Christian counseling and through the course of it my wife told me the entire truth. I know many of you may think I didn't need to know, that it seems like I was judging her for her past but I wasn't. It wasn't a matter of ""I need to know everything"" it was that I was finding this stuff out in some of the most humiliating ways possible.

During and after this we stopped going to Mass. I was still angry with God. But I slowly started to heal from this rough part in our marriage and felt a draw back to the Mass, first at the invitation of my wife, that we should be going to church.  We both went to confession and started attending regularly again. At first it felt odd to be back but then, for lack of a better word it felt, nice. It felt like home.

I thought we were in the best place possible in our marriage. We have never been able to have children but even that didn't feel lacking. If it happened, it happened, no worries. I felt so alive, so happy, so content. And now this. My life is changed forever in a 6 hour time period. 

I'm not angry with God. At least not now. I can't say that I won't experience that emotion in the future. But as of now, I am so hurt. I keep asking God ""why?"" Why did you allow this? Why didn't you tell me there was a problem before? Why didn't you warn me? Why did you let me think everything was so great just to let the rug be pulled from under me? I am drowning! I am dying inside! Why aren't you helping with this pain? 

My wife quit her job. She also changed her phone number and cut ties with her friends at work. She said she wants to rebuild trust, that she doesn't have to work and that she wants to be open and not hide her communications with friends. Mostly i find this reassuring but a small part of me is very scared she is going to resent all of these changes and leave me. 

The priest said not to make any decisions for 6 months or more. I know this is the right thing to do. My emotions change minute to minute. I can't imagine basing a life altering decision on the way I feel now.

I am not drinking. I want to. I want to really badly. I just want to feel numb. But I don't think I could stop if I started right now. And I know alcohol and depression don't mix very well.

I was humbled to receive such a gift.  I hardly consider my presence here a blessing, especially when I consider myself a moody old curmudgeon.

As my posts show, I suffer from the incurable wound of pride.  Though I try to overcome this vice, and though I confess it on a weekly basis, I still suffer from a grave deficiency of the virtue that is humility.  

I am reminded of a great quote from St. Josemaria Escriva, ""*You...?  Proud?  Of what?*""

I can only *hope* that the gift was given because I have served as a mere instrument to bring the gift-giver closer to Christ in *some way*.

However, a thought occurred to me yesterday. If the situation were reversed, *i.e.* I had grown up with the current translation which was being replaced with the old translation, I'd almost certainly hate the changes. I'd bemoan the the dumbing down of mass and the lack of reverence in the new words compared to the old. I'd be like, ""Dammit, we have a perfectly good word that means ""one in being"" and that word is *consubstantial*!"" My feelings would not be mixed, they would be almost wholly negative.

1370431139.0,35,self.Catholicism,1fpqpn,"Contraception, NFP, and the Tradition",InTeConfidoIesu,42,7,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1fpqpn/contraception_nfp_and_the_tradition/,"(I originally wrote this as a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1fphnz/sex_denied_crisis_magazine/), but spent so much time on it, and think it's important enough, that I'm submitting it here for general discussion.) 

I have been in an endless and acute internal debate about the issue of contraception for months now. Last week, my non-believing girlfriend and I decided to take a break while I figured out to what degree this teaching can determine the future course of my life. It's sort of an existential issue at the moment, and so I'd like to share my thoughts. Note that I am not some raging liberal, but rather someone sincerely attempting to find the truth.

The problem is that the Church is experiencing some major cognitive dissonance at the moment. This dissonance is perfectly expressed in its promotion of Natural Family Planning (NFP). Basically, the Church has—in a move deeply out of line with the Church Fathers and much of the tradition—recognized (a) that there can be reasons for married couples not to have children, (b) there can be reasons to have sex without intending procreation, and (c) that sexuality is somehow a ""beautiful thing."" Like it or not, this is not in line with the Tradition.

Here is what Augustine had to say:

&gt;It is, however, one thing for married persons to have intercourse only for the wish to beget children, which is not sinful: it is another thing for them to desire carnal pleasure in cohabitation, but with the spouse only, which involves venial sin. For although propagation of offspring is not the motive of the intercourse, there is still no attempt to prevent such propagation, either by wrong desire or evil appliance. They who resort to these, although called by the name of spouses, are really not such; they retain no vestige of true matrimony, but pretend the honourable designation as a cloak for criminal conduct. (On Marriage &amp; Concupiscence)

This is not an eccentricity on the part of Augustine; some of the Church Fathers were even more radical:

&gt;If a man marries in order to have children, he ought not to have a sexual desire for his wife. He ought to produce children by a reverent, disciplined act of will. (Clement of Alexandria)

&gt;Do you imagine that we approve of any sexual intercourse except for the procreation of children? He who is too ardent a lover of his own wife is an adulterer. (Jerome)

And of course Paul said ""it is better not to touch a woman,"" and Christ advised those who could manage it to be celibate.

So basically, in the Tradition, the only legitimate purpose of sex is procreation. It is a sin to take pleasure in sex, and a *mortal* sin to avoid procreation by ""wrong desire""—e.g. NFP. (Augustine actually mentions a primitive form of the rhythm method as an abomination in another writing which I can't find right now.)

By accepting NFP, the Church has shown that two strains of thought are on a collision course: the anti-sex Tradition and the new, emerging, pleasure-is-fundamentally-good, sex-is-beautiful tradition.

I really have not taken a position here yet, but I think it has to go either one way or the other, without this contradiction which causes so much psychic pain to so many believers. I have tried defending NFP so many times, but it all rings false—in the end, NFP is using a technology to prevent conception while still allowing sexual intercourse. Either the Church has to embrace contraception, or drop NFP. I don't see a way around it.

In the same treatise (On Marriage &amp; Concupiscence), Augustine makes a distinction between the Old and New Testaments. Aiming to have a ""full quiver,"" a big family, was applicable only in a world before Christ. After Christ, our duty is to deny ourselves and spread the word. Fertility as such is not important in the early Tradition. Paul advises marriage mainly to avoid fornication. How is that incompatible with a contracepted relationship? The main argument against marriage has always been the fact that it turns one's eyes away from God and toward wife and children. Could not a family with a wife and two children be more conducive to focus on God than a family with a wife and ten children, and all the massive worldly worries that brings up today?

It is possible the Church Fathers were simply wrong on this issue. The argument could be made that they—esp. Augustine—were so heavily influenced by Platonic dualism and Stoicism that they separated soul and body too much in their thought. Or they were right, and the Church is wrong on NFP.

Either sexual pleasure is a good independent of the children it produces, or it is a necessary evil aimed purely at reproduction. This usual line of argument tries to have it both ways. The Church either needs to take the traditional hard line and ban NFP (which will alienate many) or grant that there are reasons for sexual pleasure not intended to create children, and that the type of technology you use to contracept (remember, NFP is contraception, and, I would argue, artificial to boot) is not an essential matter.

The stakes here are very high: for those, like myself, who are trying their best to be faithful, obedient Catholics, being confronted by this mixed message can lead to all sorts of uncertainty about the Church's teaching authority. It is sort of a ""lynchpin"" issue. Thoughts?

(Also, a little factoid which made me ponder a bit: one of the main developers of the Pill ([John Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rock_\(American_scientist\))) was a faithful Catholic and developed it to find a Catholic solution to the problem of contraception &amp; the rhythm method [NFP].)",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1fpqpn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1fpqpn/contraception_nfp_and_the_tradition/,

Still haven't found that perfect church just yet, but I've definitely learned what little things I really like and really don't like.

**Bonum:**

- A proper narthex. In too many churches, this has been reduced to a vestibule or lobby. However, the little space between the outside world and inside the church should be a place where you can mentally set earthly things aside and prepare yourself to focus on God. I love it when churches are built to accommodate this.

- Putting the baptismal font front and center when you enter the nave. This is where baptisms should be performed, as the new Christian symbolically ""enters"" the Church.

- A sprinkling of Latin. I'm no SSPX Vatican II denier, but I certainly appreciate the role of the language of the Church as a unifying element (like Hebrew for Jews or Arabic for Muslims). I primarily attend Mass in English, but I love it when they do the Sanctus, the Agnus Dei, etc. in Latin.

- Well-behaved kids dressed up for Church. Shows that the parents are on the ball. Bonus points for little girls wearing the veil.

- Priests who actually talk to you! Open with a joke, make the homily relevant, show us a little emotion during the opening and closing! Make people *want* to come to Mass!

**Nefas:**

- Hands down, the biggest sin on modernist architecture is when the Tabernacle gets moved off to the side, and the presider's chair is placed at the center of the altar. It makes the church look like the priest's throne room (or worse, a Masonic temple), and that little box with crackers in it is an afterthought. I can barely bring myself to attend Mass in churches set up like this.

- Inefficient Communion distribution. I don't particularly like EMHCs (although I am trained as one myself). However, when you have 300+ people at Mass, one priest handing out Communion simply doesn't get the job done. I attended one very conservative parish where many parishioners chose to receive on their knees. That's great and wonderfully respectful, but said parish really ought to use the Communion rail just to keep things moving. While we're on this...

- Ushers dismissing people aisle by aisle to go up for Communion. Exactly what problem do they imagine they're solving here? Would people trample over one another to get in line if left to their own devices?

- Obvious high altar-ectomy. There are some churches where it's painfully obvious that a beautiful high altar was excavated the moment Vatican II was handed down. It's typically seen in large, older churches with very ornate fixtures and a big, solid, whitewashed square of wood at the back of the altar.

- Electric votive candles. I realize that God doesn't care if I light a real candle or an electric one, but it just feels... cheap. Especially when there's still a donation box for it (really?).

- Bad cantors. I'm sorry, but some are just painful. It's especially embarrassing going to Mass with my protestant wife, who grew up in a church where being in the choir was a really big deal.

Sorry, just had to vent. Anybody else have little knee-jerk turn-ons and turn-offs like that?",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1978kk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1978kk/the_little_things_about_a_church/,

As I implied just now, I have recently had some doubts on my mind about God or, about whether he truly watches over us. This is brought about from the recent shooting in Connecticut. I cannot understand how something like that could happen God willing.

Due to this, I went to speak to the Father at my local church about it, and what I feel is the last straw was dropped on me. He was in a hurry to talk to a group of those church-families who come to mass to speak with ""friends with benefits (I don't mean this in the sexual way)"" than for the Eucharist. I told him it would only take about 5 minutes. Then he responded by telling me to tell him right there in the middle of the room my troubles. It was hard to speak to him because others were talking loudly, but he finally understood and essentially told me: ""How can you doubt when you just finished mass?"". I explained to him how I am conflicted about something like the shooting happening and God allowing it. Then he went on about looking at flowers and nature and stars and know that God is all around us. Then he told me to pray and I would be consoled.

I was still not relieved at all, and so asked if I could meet with him another day. he simply repeated I ""pray, just pray"" and hurried off. I have never liked the church. And now I like it even less. I feel the church's clergy is largely populated by the same ""Pharisees"" Christ warned about. All ritual and flashy speeches and no true regard for the people of the church. I have always seen the church's management dominated by high-amount donor families who know all the other high-donor families and give each other hugs after each mass before asking each other for favors. They always reserve seating for themselves and make it so their kids are given first communion or confirmed earlier than others. They are always best of friends with the Father. 

On a bigger scale, it sickens me to see how much we have swayed away from the messages Christ taught us. We are more politicized that a good amount of fundamentalists churches. And this is continuing. I can see why abortion would be regarded as sinful by the church. I just hate how clergy and churchgoers alike spend more time picketing in front of abortion clinics than working at the food pantry. I hate how we give homosexuals the message that they are inhuman and hated by an all-loving God. How they will be eternally damned for a genetic disorder (most of the time) they have no choice over. I hate how we teach our children than their Jewish and Muslim friends at school are evil for not accepting Christ as God incarnate. I hate how clergy tells us who to vote for and what to think about things.

It sickens me and I'm tired of it. I want to be a servant of the Lord. But I am not to be a servant of the church nor the mob mentality that has plagued it since the middle ages on and off. I hate to sound like a protestant. but maybe that is what I am becoming. I am just afraid and angry. I have always been Catholic, and I know nothing more. If any of you have something that you think could enlighten my mind and help me through this, it is greatly appreciated.

From his [blog post](http://blog.archny.org/index.php/a-prayer-for-our-country-at-the-democratic-national-convention/):


&gt; With a “firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence,”  let us close this convention by praying for this land that we so cherish and love:

&gt; Let us Pray.

&gt; Almighty God, father of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, revealed to us so powerfully in your Son, Jesus Christ, we thank you for showering your blessings upon this our beloved nation.  Bless all here present, and all across this great land, who work hard for the day when a greater portion of your justice, and a more ample measure of your care for the poor and suffering, may prevail in these United States.  Help us to see that a society’s greatness is found above all in the respect it shows for the weakest and neediest among us.

&gt; We beseech you, almighty God to shed your grace on this noble experiment in ordered liberty, which began with the confident assertion of inalienable rights bestowed upon us by you:  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

&gt; Thus do we praise you for the gift of life.  Grant us the courage to defend it, life, without which no other rights are secure.  We ask your benediction on those waiting to be born, that they may be welcomed and protected.  Strengthen our sick and our elders waiting to see your holy face at life’s end, that they may be accompanied by true compassion and cherished with the dignity due those who are infirm and fragile.

&gt; We praise and thank you for the gift of liberty.  May this land of the free never lack those brave enough to defend our basic freedoms.  Renew in all our people a profound respect for religious liberty:  the first, most cherished freedom bequeathed upon us at our Founding. May our liberty be in harmony with truth; freedom ordered in goodness and justice.  Help us live our freedom in faith, hope, and love.  Make us ever-grateful for those who, for over two centuries, have given their lives in freedom’s defense; we commend their noble souls to your eternal care, as even now we beg the protection of your mighty arm upon our men and women in uniform.

&gt; We praise and thank you for granting us the life and the liberty by which we can pursue happiness.  Show us anew that happiness is found only in respecting the laws of nature and of nature’s God.  Empower us with your grace so that we might resist the temptation to replace the moral law with idols of our own making, or to remake those institutions you have given us for the nurturing of life and community.  May we welcome those who yearn to breathe free and to pursue happiness in this land of freedom, adding their gifts to those whose families have lived here for centuries.

&gt; We praise and thank you for the American genius of government of the people, by the people and for the people.  Oh God of wisdom, justice, and might, we ask your guidance for those who govern us:  President Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph Biden, Congress, the Supreme Court, and all those, including Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan, who seek to serve the common good by seeking public office.  Make them all worthy to serve you by serving our country.  Help them remember that the only just government is the government that serves its citizens rather than itself. With your grace, may all Americans choose wisely as we consider the future course of public policy.

&gt; And finally Lord, we beseech your benediction on all of us who depart from here this evening, and on all those, in every land, who yearn to conduct their lives in freedom and justice.  We beg you to remember, as we pledge to remember, those who are not free; those who suffer for freedom’s cause; those who are poor, out of work, needy, sick, or alone; those who are persecuted for their religious convictions, those still ravaged by war.

&gt; And most of all, God Almighty, we thank you for the great gift of our beloved country.

&gt; For we are indeed “one nation under God,” and “in God we trust.”

&gt; So dear God, bless America.  You who live and reign forever and ever.

He knows what I need, even if it's not what I want. And most importantly: life is fragile, so handle with prayer.**

Lately, I have been increasingly upset at God. After seven months of job applications, I had only been offered four interviews, none of which led to any job prospects--the money we had put aside for a baby we began using to cover living costs. My husband and I began fighting as things got tight around here, and though he is in school, the student loans and his part time job have only given us enough money for basic necessities. He began accusing me of not trying to find work and being lazy.

On top of this, we have been trying to conceive a child for three years. We finally got an appointment with a Napro Technologist doctor at the beginning of March of this year. After months of Metformin and still no baby, we were supposed to start Clomid in September, but because of our financial situation, we had to cancel the appointment--even though the program the doctor put us on is actually working and brought my period back after 18 months of not having one.

Fast forward to Monday of last week. I received word from a job I applied for that the position had been filled, and though my period was officially four days late, my pregnancy test came up negative. The icing on the cake was when a friend that I hadn't talked to in four years randomly messaged me on Facebook saying that she just had an abortion and really needed someone to talk to, and since I was the only one on at 3 am on a Tuesday, she decided to message me. Months of hard work, not eating an ounce of ice cream to help maintain the periods the Metformin had brought back, completely removing all forms of gluten from my diet, and drinking so much water I thought the local kids were going to use me as a swimming pool, my periods stopped AGAIN. And AGAIN, I was put in the position of comforting someone who destroyed this precious gift that I couldn't have.

I was so angry at God. Here I was doing everything I could to find a job, to get pregnant, and to improve my life, and nothing was happening. I cried and cried, wondering why all my hard work wasn't paying off, why everything was constantly falling apart in my life and had been falling apart since I converted to Catholicism. I asked Him what He wanted from me, what I could do to get in His favor again, and what He expected me to do. As with all my prayers for the past few months, I heard and felt nothing: only silence.

I didn't pray on Wednesday last week. I was like the angry child giving their parent the silent treatment because I didn't get my lollipop. I felt like God had abandoned me, forgotten about me, stopped loving me, and I felt like everyone else mattered more to Him in the world than me. Wednesday was not a good day.

Thursday morning, I began feeling guilty for the way I acted the day before. That morning, I said a rosary and scheduled a confession with a priest. When I got home, I received a phone call from a job that I had forgotten I had applied to. They wanted me to come in for an interview on Friday afternoon. I called them back and told them I would be there.

On Friday, I said a prayer before I went in, mostly an apology for the way I had been acting--I was at the end of my rope and lashing out. And then I told myself I was going to get that job.

The interview went really well, better than any other interview I ever went to: I wasn't even nervous. As soon as I got home, there was a message on my answering machine. I got the job. I GOT THE JOB. After months of being let down over and over, I finally got the job.

I woke up Saturday morning feeling completely rested and refreshed. I don't think I woke up once during the night. And when I went to pee, my underwear was completely soaked with blood. My period had started. My FREAKING period had started. As much as this would upset any normal woman, it meant that my hard work was continuing to pay off, even if it was a week late.

As if things couldn't get any better, it turns out my husband never cancelled the appointment we had for our fertility doctor, and only pushed it back to the end of October. Not only will I be starting Clomid at the end of October, but it will be covered by insurance! Because I'm employed! And the appointment is the day after my birthday! And I'm due to ovulate the day after the appointment! The timing of everything came together too perfectly for this all to be just a coincidence.

I apologize if this really isn't the appropriate place for this and that it was so long. I have no religious friends to share this with, and no family I can talk to. My husband and I have officially been celebrating all weekend, but I really wanted to share all these emotions with others. I feel there are so many times in our lives that we forget God loves us and wants what's best for us, especially if it doesn't fit with what we think is best for us. I know I felt like that just last week--I was so hopeless and angry, and I honestly felt like He had forgotten me. But I know better now. And I have learned to be prayerful and patient.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_yz93s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/yz93s/what_i_have_learned_about_patience_and_gods_love/,

1345073175.0,32,self.Catholicism,yafi2,Had a bit of an adventure today,Roryduck,35,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/yafi2/had_a_bit_of_an_adventure_today/,"The last time I went to Church was the Baccaularete (sp?) mass we held before graduation last May. I had zero intention of going back to mass ever again. Like a lot of people, having Catholicism shoved down my throat for 18 years (my grandmother threw a Bible at me once when I asked her WHY we believed something. I can't even remember what it was anymore) and 13 years of Catholic school had turned me off going to Church.

The past few months have been rough. I won't go into details, but suffice to say I will be infinitely glad once this year is over with. I started dating this wonderful guy who happens to be atheist. It was in our debates that I started wanting to go back to Church ironically enough. Not this past Sunday but the one before that, I attempted to go to mass. However, I forgot to eat beforehand and wound up getting sick and having to leave before the service even started.

Today, for no particular reason, I decided to go to mass. I wound up arriving at the Church 2 hours before the mass started, so I just wandered around, lit some candles as an offering and prayed. I saw some free rosaries with cards explaining how, and as I don't remember the mysteries nor all the prayers, I picked one up. Walking back to my dorm, I walked past an Interdenominational Church. I decided to walk in and explore that church as well. While sitting in the pew, I suddenly felt like praying the rosary. I went to pull down the kneeler, and realized there was no kneeler. Despite that, I kneeled on the floor and said the rosary. My knees were killing me, but considering how sinful I've been, I saw it as some sort of penance. 

By then, it was a lot closer to the mass time so I walked back to the Catholic Church and took a missal (I think that's they're called), which is when I realized that today was a Holy Day of Obligation. So rather than a quiet mass with not a lot of people judging me for wearing short shorts and a slightly low cut short, there would be lots of people. I still got there early enough that there weren't a lot of people, so someone in charge came and asked me if I would like to present the gifts. I went into a bit of a panic mode and declined. 

Once mass started I realized something. The responses have changed. I kept looking at everyone else, completely and totally lost. Thankfully, no one said anything about it to me. It was a little embarrassing, especially since the elderly lady sitting next to me seemed totally fine with the new responses, and it's so hard changing from what you've known for years. Afterwards, she and I talked a little bit. She was so nice, and the congregation seemed rather close to each other. So long story short, I think I'm going to start going to mass again and considering coming back to the Church.

I went to catholic schools all my life, from elementary to high school. I'm nearing the end of my 2nd year of university, and I'm beginning to feel worried about the strength of my faith and the lack of devotion I'm showing. 

Although my family is catholic, they are not very religious. I've tried to convince them to come to church with me every Sunday, but nothing has changed (yet, I'm sure they'll come around eventually). So instead of every Sunday, I started going to mass once a week at a church on campus. My campus is quite large, but the attendance is probably between 10-15 people per mass. Between school, work and everything in between, my devotion has been dwindling and I've become lazy... The only consistent thing I do is read a daily devotional ""Jesus Calling"" by Sarah Young every morning, and pray at night. 

To add to everything, although university is meant to be a place of welcoming for most things, there are a few times during lectures or discussions where someone (profs and students) will say something about the Church (not in a positive light), and I'll suddenly feel uncomfortable to speak. I know that the discussions are for academic purposes, but it often feels like an unsafe place to discuss my own beliefs. So I end up participating very little and listen to others (which truthfully I do not mind too much.) However, there have been many times where I wanted to speak up and defend the Church, but I worry that my knowledge of the church's history and teachings won't be enough to explain thoroughly and will fail to do the teachings of the Catholic Church any justice. 

So /r/catholicism, this is a plea for suggestions, advice, words of wisdom, and prayer for me please? I've never experienced being in a surrounding without engaging in prayer and speaking about religion regularly. Sounds pathetic for a 19 year old, but the lack of regularity is beginning to take a toll, which is the last thing I want. Thanks again and God bless.

So, I have some questions.
Also, wherever possible, please back your answer up with an excerpt from the Catechism or other Church document. 


1. What is the Church's specific teaching on evolution, specifically Adam and Eve? I personally believe in a literal Adam and Eve, and thought my belief was basically the same as the RCC's, though some recent things I've read seem to suggest otherwise. 

2. Can someone explain what the Church teaches about ""no salvation outside of the Church."" I always understood it to mean that the RCC is right about salvation, and everyone will be applied to its principle. Basically, can Protestants be saved? What about converts from Catholicism to a Protestant denomination?

3. What's the teaching on hell?

4. What are the best apologetics online for Catholicism?

For converts to Catholicism:

5. When were you certain that you had to become Catholic?

6. What was the time between when you first felt the pull to become Catholic and the time when you actually started the process?

This brought up a question about gay marriage:

1. First off, is what I read accurate? Or have you heard differently?
2. If it is true, why do Catholics so vehemently oppose the legalization of gay marriage if it's only civil and not viewed as a real marriage? 

I'm a conservative Catholic who fully supports the decision of the church not to grant sacramental marriages to gays but I've long been conflicted about the question of civil marriage for gays.

For a long while I was torn as to weither or not what I was doing was wrong, I quickly came to the conclusion that masturbating to pornography was wrong, but then the question came up, is masturbation without pornography wrong? I've read the health benefits of masturbation, and I don't think God would create something that is good for you to be a sin, but I'm not sure. Someone help.

Secondly, I've cried out to God numerous times, I've tried cutting myself off cold turkey, I've tried weening myself off of it, I've tried what I think to be everything. Nothing seems to work, temptation find my everywhere, I can't escape it. I unsubscribe from any and all racy subreddits, but it still finds me, and I'm feeling very helpless.

I am not Catholic, was baptized Episcopalian, but essentially have not been religious my entire life. On the other hand, he comes from an extremely devout Catholic family and faith plays a huge part in his life. For the past year, I’ve definitely challenged him on his beliefs – which I think has allowed for him to actually understand what he sincerely believes in versus what family, the Church, modern society etc. He has become more “religious” as a result of these conversations and has realized that he does indeed want to follow Catholic doctrine…which brings us to NFP post-marriage. I completely support him in his realization of everything, and sincerely think that his acceptance of his own beliefs has brought him peace. Once he realized this though we mutually decided that we should break up. The thing about that (and I definitely know how young we are, fish in the sea etc.) is that this relationship was/is so strong, it has meant so much to both of us, and when I picture my future I really do see him in it. (Not going to harp on that though, because I think that you get the drift that I’m conflicted)

NFP is something that initially when I hear about it it’s like “say what?” just because I was never brought up thinking about it or ever considering it as an option…like, EVER. I want a family, even a big one, pretty bad but I also believe in supporting my children financially as best as I can, and (let’s get real) constant pregnancy doesn’t sound too appealing to me (which I know if done correctly doesn’t happen). Recently though I have been reading more so about the natural aspects of it, and have found my own rationalization for the practice of it (it wouldn’t be my first choice necessarily, but there is non-theologically based rationalization). I need time to really discern all of this, and time to adjust to life without him, because I know that if I were to go back to him right now saying that “I think I could do this,” it would be as a result of a break up rather than my own individual reconciliation of the idea.

But, while this is still on my mind, I would really love to hear from people out there who practice NFP and their experiences. If people are of mixed religions too, I would really appreciate thoughts about what made you decide to use NFP etc., especially from the perspective of the non-Catholic partner? Or if you know of couples like that, would love to hear about their experiences, and how people have dealt with judgments from non-Catholic friends and family (definitely need help with that one).

1364528344.0,26,self.Catholicism,1b80js,My priest did his best to give a good definition of marriage.,catholic13,33,7,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1b80js/my_priest_did_his_best_to_give_a_good_definition/,"Fr. Jarett...Quick question...is the raising of children the main reason we, as Catholics, are against gay marriage becoming legal in the U.S.?
 
An important reason, but no...in my estimation the main reason is that we are one of the only denominations of Christianity to believe marriage to be a sacrament...okay, what's a sacrament?...a sacrament is something visible that reveals to us an invisible mystery of God.  In this case, the sacrament of marriage reveals to us God's innermost secret. That God exists as an eternal exchange of love...an eternal relationship of love between Father (Lover), Son (Beloved) and Holy Spirit (Love Shared).  Therefore, marriage is necessary to us for our understanding of God as love...best defined as the exchange between Lover, Beloved, and the Love they share...
 
Okay, so next question...Father &amp; Son in love...why not two men (or two women)? Can’t they exemplify Lover, Beloved, and shared Love? What’s the diff?  The Trinitarian Love of God as Lover, Beloved, and Generative Love is certainly revealed to us as a spiritually mysterious reality.  We use “Father” to be able to define some of the characteristics of the Trinitarian head because that is how God has been revealed to us, not because we believe he has possesses an old man’s body.  Certainly, this mysterious spiritual reality is confusing and that’s why God stamped into our human bodies a way to have a small taste of this exchange.  Thus, we come closest to experiencing this eternal exchange of love ""in the flesh"", by means of sex.  That's right sex. I'm not saying God is sexual, but that he reveals just a small taste of His infinity through the bonding power of our biological humanity.  This happens through the God given human ability to participate in the unitive as well as life-giving nature of the intimate exchange of the ""one flesh union""...Sex.  Husband, Wife, exchanging love by means of their bodies to the point that they become truly one...not some forced counterfeit union, but biologically through the unique complimentarity of their genital body parts...ONE...and therefore can become participants in the divine mystery of the generative creation of life in God. 
 
This is often tough to swallow, since long ago, by means of artificial birth control, our culture stripped sex and marriage far apart.  Saying marriage is not necessary for sex and sex is not necessary for marriage.  Resulting in a secularized marital ""union"" that simply means you can get some pictures, cake and government tax cuts.  If that was our definition of marriage, then sure, everybody should get some of that.  But no, the Church rightly states that marriage cannot be understood without sex and sex is not understood separate from marriage.
 
Thus, in other words, why are we so defensive of the definition of marriage?  Because we believe marriage to be the sacrament directly linked to our doctrinal understandings of who God is as Trinitarian ""Love"" and for what purpose He has created us.  So yeah, if it wasn't for that 2,000 year old understanding of marriage (or older since we get this revelation from Genesis), and the fact that this definition of marriage has existed throughout all the major cultures of Western civilization (because most of them were Christian), long, long before our baby government (230+ yrs. old) then heck yeah, SCOTUS, redefine marriage all you want.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_1b80js,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1b80js/my_priest_did_his_best_to_give_a_good_definition/,

We also do outreach into the community, and we get the students involved in the process of giving, to help them learn the importance of helping others.

A teacher at an area public school, upon hearing a student was planning on switching to our school, told her ""You know, it's really hard there."" Her response? ""Yes, that's why I want to be there.""

However, since we're tuition free, we rely completely on the generosity of others, typically larger Catholic communities throughout the United States and Canada.

We're currently in the process of switching to a new school building, and to continue our 20 year long presence in Appalachia, we have to reach out to benefactors beyond what our priests can raise on their weekend fundraising trips to urban parishes.

The new building is going to be a phenomenal step forward for our school--it's larger, and more centrally located, so we should be able to pull in more students and be a more visible part of the community.  However, the building we purchased needs extensive renovations to become a school.

For more information about our school, visit http://www.catholicmissionky.com

And, keep in mind there are lots of Catholic charities just like us.

1362519145.0,30,self.Catholicism,19qcjz,Prayer for Conversion ,mitkw,33,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/19qcjz/prayer_for_conversion/,"I would like to ask for prayer regarding my decision to enter into the Roman Catholic Church. This is something that has become an almost all consuming issue at the forefront of everything that I think about all the time. 

Some background first of all, I am finishing up my education at a large public university. I was raised in a very loving family of devout Protestant parents. I have been incredibly blessed to have been raised in such a devout home and I was saturated in Scripture at my earliest memory. My parents are both from the Southern Baptist tradition, but with the addition of Calvinism are Reformed Baptists. My parents moved between several small churches as I was growing up, the most recent of which they helped to start about 8 years ago. 5 years ago I graduated from High School and began going to school about 3 hours away from home.

At school I had a very difficult time in finding a church home. I knew that it was something that was important and that I needed to address. I visited several of the big Baptist churches in town but was met with difficulties of either doctrine (Calvinist background) or getting there (not having a car can be difficult) but I endeavored to attend church because I felt obligated to do so. Because of the difficult I had in attending churches I would bounce back and forth between one of the big Baptist churches in town and one of the big Methodist churches which was right next to campus. Because of my Calvinist background my parents also recommend I look into Presbyterianism, but they were not very welcoming of a non-Presbyterian. Ultimately I either could not get a ride to the big Baptist church, or I could not agree with everything about Methodism. So I would hop back and forth between churches, never really feeling at home.

While this was going on there was a leadership crisis at my home church which greatly disturbed me. The pastor had acted out of dishonesty and eventually left. The church was elder-led and my father was an elder. Then for 18 months there was a seemingly half-hearted search for a new pastor as if the elders did not know what to do or how to do it. This frustrated me a lot at what I saw as a deficiency of church government. So I started looking.

I study history, and have always been aware of the existence of Roman Catholicism and its influence over the development of Western Civilization. After what happened at home, I started reading more books. A clearly defined church polity really appealed to me, so I started looking into Presbyterianism, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, and slightly at Orthodoxy and Catholicism. The structure appealed to me so I started to look into doctrine.

At this point I really didn't think I would go into Catholicism. If you had told me I was thinking about it I would have laughed! My best friend since high school is Catholic, but I never thought I would convert. I tried to show him the error of his ways on numerous occasions. But here I was at school looking into more and more. Several of my close friends here were also Catholic, and Catholics are Christians, so why not look into it more? And that's when I started to dive in.

I started reading books, examining history, finding problems with some things, differences with others, and then. I started dating a Catholic girl. She wasn't very knowledgeable, attended Mass irregularly at best, but I wanted to know more! So I Started diving in more. Church was not really important to her, and I was getting tired of searching for a home after several years, so we quit going to church. And then last May, after she left for a study abroad, my world came crashing down.

I underwent a mental and spiritual breakdown in May. I was incredibly depressed and despondent. At some points I was close to ending my own life. I thank God for the people that He put in my life to stop me and bring me back to reason. As I was violently shaken that I would think about killing myself, a dear friend asked if I would talk to a priest, I said yes. I poured my soul out to this man about how I was scared that I was thinking about killing myself and I had to get my life with God back in order. He agreed to meet with me over the summer and recommended that if I was serious about my relationship with God to dive back into my faith. Between meeting with him and then also meeting with a counselor at school I started putting my life back together. The same friend offered again that I go on a retreat for college students that summer. He had tried to get me to go for years. With no excuse this time I went, and it changed my life. I was reminded that I was loved by God, that He purchased my life, and I need not fear. I still think that this helped save my life. My girlfriend returned from her Study Abroad after having her own experiences with God and a newfound fervor to return to the Church. Together we dove into this.

For me this consisted of enrolling through RCIA, asking questions of lots of people, talking with priests, and really smart people, and grappling with the doctrines and dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church. At this point I believe that I do want to become Catholic.

And here is the problem. I have expressed my desire to my family and they are literally mortified. My parents have both expressed their extreme displeasure with my examination of Catholicism, and that they would be deeply disappointed if I convert, and it would in some way break our relationship. My sister already thinks that I have fallen from grace and am now in the midst of a works-based quest to earn my way to heaven. My brother is the only one who does not criticize, because he believes he needs to be neutral. I have no desire to dishonor my parents, or cause them stress. I don't want to cause problems for them and their friends or the rest of our extended family. But at the same time I feel that I need to do something.

 Through experiencing the love of the Catholic community. The beauty of the Mass. The spiritual experiences I have had, I am convinced that the Holy Spirit is drawing me somewhere, and I am thinking that it is into the Church. But I am stuck! This entire process of thinking, and re-examining, evaluating, and re-evaluating is really starting to wear me out. And I don't know what to do.

As Easter draws closer and closer, I feel more and more strained between wanting to be Catholic, and wanting to stay in a good relationship with my family. At some points I have even thought about just delaying until a later time.

Really I just need prayer. Lots of it. And the courage to act upon whatever God wants me to do. I don't want to please everyone, I know I can't. But I want to feel at peace with God and the decision that I make. And advice! Any advice, or insight would be greatly welcomed. I have talked to many people, read some books and listened to talks by men such as Scott Hahn, Peter Kreeft, Taylor Marshall, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and others, but I still just don't know what to do. Or what would be best to do.

Sorry that was really long. Thank you!

TL;DR I am thinking about converting to Catholicism from Protestantism, but am experiencing severe backlash from my family. Please pray for me and offer advice.",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_19qcjz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/19qcjz/prayer_for_conversion/,
1361145877.0,29,self.Catholicism,18pw6a,Introducing Catholic Forum - an informal discussion of each week's liturgy.,Sporknight,30,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/18pw6a/introducing_catholic_forum_an_informal_discussion/,"The 1st Sunday of Lent, 2013  
Hello reddit!  My Lenten resolution this year is, instead of quitting reddit like many others have decided, to get more involved in this community!  To do that, I've decided to start a weekly discussion of each Mass’s readings, including their historical and liturgical background.  I’ll also go into their personal significance to me, and I’d love it if each of you brought your own wisdom and perspective as well!  
This idea is thanks to an adult faith formation group at my old church that would meet after each Mass to discuss the readings over coffee and pastries.  I found it helped me develop a lot as a Catholic, deepening my connection and appreciation of the faith and the Bible, and I’m hoping to recreate something similar here.

This week's readings can be found here:
http://usccb.org/bible/readings/021713.cfm

A disclaimer: I in no way claim to be any kind of authority on what these readings are really trying to get across.  I’m just trying to get a discussion going.

**1st Reading**:
DT 26:4-10
Deuteronomy, like many books of the Old Testament, was written well after the events it portrays.  The authors were using a retelling of these ancient stories to help get their people back in touch with the old laws, to guide them through difficult times (the Babylonian Exile, specifically) to be closer to God.  Whenever they celebrate the Lord by sacrificing the fruits of the land (that He led them to!), they are to recall the difficult path they took to get there, and how the Lord was always there to guide them in their time of need.

As a lector, I also find significance in the act of retelling these stories as a part of worship and celebration.  We are to never forget where we came from, what our ancestors endured, and what we can learn from those lessons.  Whenever we find ourselves oppressed and downtrodden, we should remember that the Lord is with us.  

I always like to find the connections between the first (usually Old Testament) reading, and the Gospel.  Here, I think of how the Jews spent many countless years wandering the desert before they made their way into the Promised Land.  Jesus was led into the desert, and was also subjected to challenges and temptations.  He remained steadfast, however, and made it through these challenges unharmed.  What kind of parallels can you draw between this reading and the Gospel?

**2nd Reading**:
ROM 10:8-13
The second reading is almost always an epistle, typically done in sequence throughout the year.  Looking at the overall context of said epistle can be very helpful, then.  Immediately before this reading begins, Paul writes:
""For Christ is the end of the law for the justification of everyone who has faith. Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from (the) law, 'The one who does these things will live by them.' But the righteousness that comes from faith says, 'Do not say in your heart, ""Who will go up into heaven?"" (that is, to bring Christ down) or ""Who will go down into the abyss?"" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).'""  

The coming of Jesus represents an evolution of God’s covenant with the people.  In Moses’s time, it was enough to just abide by the law.  Now, though, righteousness has to come from faith, too.  A faith that we must believe in our hearts, and confess with our mouths.  And it is this faith that unites us together under God.

I also like how this preceding passage calls us to not pass judgement on those around us by wondering who will go into heaven or hell.  Our priority should be in our belief in Christ.  

**Gospel**:
LK 4:1-13
This should be a familiar reading to most of us.  The desert stretching before us draws a parallel to the long 40 days of Lent, and while we fast from meat and make our Lenten sacrifice, we are certain to face many challenges.  What kind of challenges do you anticipate this Lenten season?

“One does not live on bread alone”.  Is He talking about the Manna in the desert that fed the wandering Jews?  Or perhaps he’s drawing an early connection to the Eucharist?  The bread is one thing, but the act of transubstantiation turns it into so much more.  Even then, we should do our part to carry that essence with us through the whole week, instead of forgetting about it by the time we get to the church parking lot.  Also, this is sound advice when you’re fasting!

“You shall worship the Lord your God, and him alone shall you serve”.  It’s easy for us to find ourselves serving more immediate pleasures over the Lord - sex, money, petty rage or envy.  These, through sin, only serve to distance us from God however.  In this day and age, I don’t think the concern would be us worshiping some other deity directly, but rather that we would be absorbed in material matters.  We should discern the difference between immediate pleasures, and true happiness.

“You shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test.”  I suppose that’s one response to “Could God microwave a burrito so hot, that even He could not eat it?”!  But seriously, this passage also emphasizes that we shouldn't go out of our way to put ourselves into ridiculously dangerous situations, and expect God to bail us out.

A final note that struck me at Mass this evening...The last few words of this reading: “He departed from him *for a time*.”  The Devil was done with his temptations for that particular moment, but was far from finished forever.  He never goes away fully - he’s always there, and temptation will always be there, even for Jesus.  We would do well to remain vigilant, and take each temptation as an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with God.  

I look forwards to hearing everyone's thoughts on this week's readings!",,False,self,t5_2qi4f,False,,,True,t3_18pw6a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/18pw6a/introducing_catholic_forum_an_informal_discussion/,

My wife and I were having a discussion about this that got a little heated last week. I'm in favor of such a world. She is not.

I noted that the English and Welsh bishops brought this back for their flocks last year. I noted that people (including me) don't take seriously the Friday penance. I said people would do one of the following: continue to disregard the rule (like they may do requirements about going to mass and any other law of the Church), they might do it out of some sense of obligation (cultural Catholics), and best case: they might do it and return closer to the Church.

She noted that if something like this came about while she was struggling with the faith, she might have been turned away for good. She said to an outsider or someone not properly catechized in the faith, this would look ludicrous, especially in today's world. She said there are more important things to worry about, particularly the notion of sin. She'd rather have, I think, a prescribed set of sermons/homilies over the course of a few years to reinvigorate the faithful. Overall though, she would prefer it always to remain an option, not a requirement.

This was a 30-minute-long discussion and I'm not giving either side its full due.

----

**So, r/Catholicism/,** in the context of Catholicism in the U.S.A.:

* Why or why wouldn't imposition of Friday abstinence (i.e., making it no longer only an acceptable Friday penance, but *the* Friday penance) be a good idea?
* If **yes**, how should it be implemented for best effect? / If **no**, is there a better way to reemphasize the penitential nature of Fridays? Or a need even?

I welcome also any English or Welsh Catholics to report on how this change has manifested itself since last year.

----

In any case, during the discussion I had with my wife, I resolved to go meatless on Fridays from now on. She is not on board.

I am not at all surprised. Today everything is in a state of crisis: the schools, the family, and above all, young people. What suprises me is that escape seems to be the only remedy to fight this widespread disease.  Many young people are skeptical of everything and everybody. Unable to stand on their own two feet, they seek refuge in drugs, alcohol, even music. Many young people make cardboard heroes for themselves and live a make-believe existence in their imitation. The models for youth are highly gifted individuals, who always win and are always happy!  Many young people identify themselves with these ""heroes"" in order to overcome their frustrations.

   The Church too has its heroes -- the saints. The saints, however, are not like the stars of movies or the music industry. They have no extraordinary talents and they do not live easy lives. The saints are normal people, just like you and me.  In the eyes of the world, the saints are losers, but in the eyes of God, they are the true heroes, the blessed, the first, the great ones.  The saints are ordinary people, with fears, and problems like everyone else. The only difference is that they live their own life, without handing it over to others. They suffer quietly. They take up something seriously and see it through.  The saints choose to love completely. They accept the wretchedness of the cross, as Christ did, for love of God and others. It does't seem like much, but really it is everything. It may seem easy, but it is true evangelical heroism.

   Consider choosing a saint to imitate. This does not mean that you can delegate your problems and your existence to them. The saints should not just be admired or prayed to, but rather imitated. Those who imitate that saints, imitate Christ, the greatest failure by the world's standards. Jesus Christ is not a super-star, but the poor one of God. The Church holds up the saints for our consideration to show us that perfection is accessible to everyone, and that sanctity does not require a nice voice, a remarkable intelligence, beauty, physical strength or fortune. No qualifications or recommendations are needed to become a saint. It is enough to have a heart and a  bit of good will. The grace of God and His mercy will do the rest. The saints may convince you that you too can stop leading a dull and useless life which you consider a failure and instead begin your adventure in search of holiness.""

I am 22 and stupid. I have sinned repeatedly, despite my warnings and my words to the Lord that I would cease. 
I have become addicted to sex and can hardly control it. I have cheated on my girlfriend many times, without her knowledge. I have lied about it. I have lied about many other things. I have spoken about people behind their backs. I have had unprotected sex with strangers. I have paid for sex. I have had sex with the same gender. I have lied about my schooling and shunned my biological father. I have told the Lord I would stop and myself, and then would continue.
Please absolve me of my sins. Please have mercy on me and, if I may ask, I am currently going through a STI scare. I'm praying everyday, all day, but I am scared that I may have herpes. Please, have mercy and forgive me and I ask that you pray for me to be clean. I do not want to ruin my life and my girlfriend's for my mistakes. I am willing to be a better person but please, pray for my forgiveness. I do not want to be diseased. Please pray for me.
I'm sorry.

I've felt so pathetic to claim myself a Roman Catholic and yet outside of Church life and the community of Catholics at my University, I act otherwise. I don't want to be lukewarm anymore. I don't want to fall into the same sins, like watching pornography and committing masturbation, and neglecting prayer life. I have a baby coming in a few months, and I need to be ready as I can be. I want to live a convicted life... To be who God planned for me to be.

In reading the bible, I have came across the same questions that many Atheists have. I am not looking for arguments, just your honest interpretation of the scripture. I wanted to ask about the Old Testament where it speaks on how to treat slaves, the clothing for women and their roles in the church. As well as the New Testament where little things such as Jesus condemning a fig tree. I'm curious as to how these rules have either changed or been forgotten. When I attended service (as well as PSR), I was taught that The Bible was the infallible word of God. How have these things changed? Have I missed something? I'm genuine in my curiosity, and mean no disrespect. I thank you for your time, and any help you can give to me on this subject.

Being born into the United Pentecostal Church, the idea that God is present in more than just the UPC is a little bit foreign to me. I think I want to be Catholic, but there are so many things in the Catechism that are hard for me to accept. The biggest problem for me is the non-belief in *sola scriptura* (being that there exists any document, authority, or code of law other than the Bible). Another teaching that I find hard to accept is the belief in the Trinity. The UPC taught that Jesus was the only person in the being that is God (much like sabellianism). The third and fourth problems are that I don't know how Blessed Mary could have been brought up into heavan body and soul, and I don't understand how she (or any Patron Saints) can intercede on our behalf whilst praying. Of course, there are many other small problems, but they are not the point. What I really want to know is how those of you not born into the Catholic faith came to understand it better, and how you were able to reject the older teachings (if that is the case). And as a final question, when you did make the choice to join the Church, how did your family and friends react? I ask because most of my family left the Catholic Church years ago, and one member truly renounced the faith completely, and is currently on something of a crusade against the Church. That's all I have, thank you so much for reading all of this!

Some examples I've seen are relieving menstrual pain, regulating hormones for PCOS, and controlling acne.  What's the Catholic position on these uses of a drug that also prevents conception?  Are they opposed to offering insurance plans that would cover Ortho-Cyclin for treatment of PCOS, for example?

I assume the Catholic church don't oppose hysterectomy in the event of uterine cancer, even though that also has a contraceptive effect.  Of course, the obvious difference is that women aren't likely to go to their doctor and say, ""Hey, doc, I have uterine cancer, can you give me a hysterectomy?"" when they just want to avoid getting pregnant. The Catholic church might reasonably foresee women saying to their doctors, ""I have bad cramps, can you give me the Pill?"" when they really just want a contraceptive.

I had a few questions that I am hoping people may be able to answer. 

I am 21 years old, I'm a girl, and I have huge problem in the dating aspect of my life. I've only had one boyfriend which didn't end very well because of my beliefs. I'm a moderately conservative person in a pretty liberal setting. I find it very hard to meet anyone who shares similar views.

I go to church every week with my mom but there isn't any men my age there and even if there was, I would be unsure how to approach them.

I was wondering if there are any suggestions on how to meet more people, even just to have more friends, that share similar beliefs. I've been to youth groups and retreats but there hasn't been much luck. Are their any dating sites? 

Also, in a culture that is so driven to tear any religion down- I especially see this because I am a science major and meet many people with interesting and different views- how do you stay positive and upbeat while feeling challenged by someone?

Starting this Advent, I'd like to wear and pray the devotional for a scapular.  How would I go about doing this, and which type of scapular should I wear?  Also if this is something that one can't simply start, please let me know.

Thanks!
