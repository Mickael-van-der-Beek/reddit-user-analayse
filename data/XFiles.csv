1361038980.0,28,self.XFiles,18nbhw,"Thoughts about the Anasazi trilogy (season 2-3), the great turning point of XF, from an old-timer fan",NeedingSleep,33,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/18nbhw/thoughts_about_the_anasazi_trilogy_season_23_the/,"INC wall of text, be warned.

I should be studying for an exam, but instead I find myself re-watching the Anasazi trilogy, contemplating my teenage years - my lost youth, and thinking about these lovely three episode and their impact on the series' progress. Anasazi, The Blessing Way and Paper Clip were the first episode trilogy IIRC - up to then, there were only two-parters and MoTWs. It was a little like an early X-Files movie. I was lucky enough to watch it on my early stages of fandom.


The year was 1998 or 1997. I started watching XF around S2, during a chain of horror-flavored monster-of-the-week style episodes. The show had an ""adults only"" warning, and being 14ish back then, I wanted to challenge myself and watch grown up TV. I had my blanket on, and whenever a gory scene came up, I buried my head under it. It was good TV, but the Anasazi trilogy - which surprisingly lacked any bloody or scary motifs - turned me into a fan. The local network that aired XF was proud for purchasing the 3rd season fast enough after the US airing, so we didn't have to wait for the cliff hanger resolution.


**WHY ANASAZI WAS AWESOME:**


What was so amazing about Anasazi, The Blessing Way and Paper Clip?
I really can't remember, and watching it now I can't help wondering how the *frak* I even understood it back then, knowing so little about the show's lore and the main characters. I reckon it was David Simon, the creator of The Wire, who once explained why he refuses to over-simplify the drug lingo on his show: his viewers, said Simon, are not stupid and rather think for themselves than have everything dumbed down for them. The XF mytharc was too quite convoluted, and required a lot of self-thinking. Some would even argue that in later stages, that idea was taken to the extreme and beyond all coherent plot. But at that time, it seemed simply brilliant, intriguing, thought-provoking and most of all very believable. 


Yep, believable science fiction. XF was my first introduction into scifi and provided me an easy landing in the genre: all three episodes discussed the possibility of a great government conspiracy to hide the existence of extraterrestrial life arriving on our planet, yet none displayed actual little green men on screen. The cadavers buried in the quarry were questionably-alien but in any case, not cartoonish. No one's disbelief would be suspended. 


Maybe the story conveyed on these three episodes wasn't really fictional, who knows. I used to think that the X-Files was not a very political show, and that the ideas of government conspiracy were to be treated as a plot device. But last week the Australian press revealed that my current government jailed a man - ostensibly a spy or a secret agent, according to sources - who committed ""suicide"" under very suspicious circumstances shortly after. Maybe truth is stranger than fiction. It's true that some of the creatures XF depicted were propesterous or plain silly sometimes, but the story of that trilogy could be real.



**Feminism, skepticism and one ginger abductee**



Other reasons for liking those episodes, in retrospect, is that they entailed a great shift in the working relationship of Mulder and Scully. As a feminist I always thought highly of the show for creating such a brilliant, independent, logical, not a sexual object and generally very positive female character like Dr. Scully - but some criticized the fact that she was dragging herself after Mulder, playing second violin to his demented quest for his lost sister. 

Anasazi was the turning point: after Mulder is shot, Scully nurses him back to health (was nice to see a softer side of her for a change too!) and tells him the following line:

&gt; SCULLY: There's something else. My name is in those files. It appears in the latest entries with Duane Barry's.

&gt; MULDER: In what context?

&gt; SCULLY: It's not clear, but it has something to do with a test. I want you to find out Mulder. I need you to.


This is, in my opinion, the point in which it became more than a job for her too. It has gradually turned into a joint quest, a truth they both had to seek from now on. After the return from her abduction, Scully was reluctant to discuss what happened to her, claiming she has no recollection of those events. Maybe she wanted to forget, knowing somewhere in the back of her head how traumatic the experience was. But after reviewing this file, she cannot turn a blind eye anymore. She is a part of it, this is her life now. Scully becomes more of a Mulder herself, so to speak.


Furthermore, on the last episode of the trilogy, Mulder allows her to make the final decision of whether to make the deal and give up the uncopyable DAT tape or not. She has gained the right to make those choices, because her sister was hurt, like his. Eventually, when Melissa dies, she truly becomes his equal: they both lost their sisters because of this search for some greater truth. Scully's character gained a lot more depth than the formerly slightly-nagging skeptic shorty.


Another interesting turning point was the well-manicured man's presentation as a congenial, friendlier conspirator. Later he'd make an excellent appearance on FTF as well. I miss his splendid accent, too bad he didn't get to play a bigger role.

**Closure**

During junior high and some of my high school years, I got carried into the online XF fandom world, reading lots and lots of sites on primitive browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. That was the dawn of the internet and everything was so low-tech and had their quaint charm. Some of those materials are, fortunately, still available thanks to The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. 

I drifted away from that world, only to return a decade and a half later, nearing my 30s. I think it's amazing that the show seems just as brilliant to a 30 year old girl as it was to a 15 one. Maybe I haven't changed that much since?

Unbeknown to them, an alien craft immobilized a US submarine patrolling under the Arctic ice and there is now an alien bounty hunter on the loose committing the murders. Mulder's world is turned upside down however when he receives an urgent call from his father telling him to come home. Once there, he finds a young woman in the living room talking to his mother. It's his sister Samantha, who was kidnapped by aliens 11 years ago. She tells him they are being hunted by an alien and that her life is in danger. Scully is surprised when Mulder calls her - because Mulder is standing in the room with her.

One of my favorite seasons so far without a doubt - so many good episodes. Unusual Suspects was great (the Lone Gunmen are freaking awesome), along with Post-Modern Prometheus, Kitsunegari, Bad Blood, the Pine Bluff Variant, and Folie a Deux. It was almost stressful watching Mulder struggle internally as he ""lost his faith"" throughout the season (thanks to Kritschgau), but today I found that it made for the perfect buildup to the Big Show.

Which brings me to the purpose of this post: Holy crow! That was great. The return of CSM in the S5 finale was, in a weird way, a relief - I feel like his machinations give the show a lot of momentum and tension - and I loved his role in the movie. It was awesome watching what really felt like a 2-hr long episode with movie-level production quality. More than anything, the look of wonder on Mulder's face when the UFO takes off towards the end was supremely satisfying. Can't wait to dig in to Season 6!

Did any of you guys and gals get to catch this one on the big screen? That must've been one hell of a show. I still can't believe I'm only getting around to watching all of this now, and I'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts on the first movie / Season 5.",,False,self,t5_2rtyt,False,,,True,t3_16gjcw,http://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/16gjcw/i_just_saw_fight_the_future_for_the_first_time_in/,

I have so much stuff.  I""m going to attempt to make a list now, and if anyone seems interested I will make a full detailed list and put some pics up.

Here it is
Over 150 Magazines with X-Files related covers.  All in mint/near mint condition in their own individual plastic sleeves.  Including almost all TV Guides that had an X-Files themed cover.

A few of the X-Files graphic novels/comics

A complete film reel (from a friend that worked at a theater) of the original X-Files movie trailer shown in theaters.

Two X-Files Binders

Almost a complete set of the CCG card came, all mint condition in sleeves.  This means all the commons, the uncommons, a few rares and a couple of the ultra rares.

Complete trading card sets of season 1-7 (I believe those are the right seasons but I will double check).  I may also have 8 and 9 but again I will check.

X-Files Lunchbox (not mint but great condition)

Action figures.  The boxes for the figures are beat up (the card board part).  However the figures inside are untouched.

There is more stuff I think but its late and I'm making this posting late.  So again, I can be more detailed and put pictures up but only if anyone seems interested.

Thanks!!!
&lt;3 XFMelissa


Ok, gonna post some pics within the next few minutes. My roommate is gonna help me get the box of magazines out of the storage room in a bit so those will be coming next

Second Edit:
 
Here is the album I'm working on: http://imgur.com/a/zCbEm#0
So far it has the Trading card sets, one binder, and the film reel.  I""m working on the rest of the pictures.  
For the trading card sets this is what I have:
Trading card set one (various episodes included in this set)
Season 1 Cards
Season 2 Cards
Season 3 Cards
Season 4 &amp; 5 Cards
Season 6 &amp; 7 Cards
Season 8 Cards
(No season 9 sorry)
X-Files FTF trading card set
X-Files Showcase cards

I also have some foil and holograms, gonna take picture of those next.

Now, it's possible that this was a coincidence. But after I recognized that line, I realized that the lead female character in TCITW was a redhead named Dana...

They have interesting and deep characters, the characters do evolve over time and important characters are never flat or just ""plain evil"", they all have more than just one side to them and the recurrent themes are just well made and well written. On top of that they don't spill the beans too quickly or show too many trashy alien shots, they keep it special and mysterious and they do a good job of avoiding too many tacky shots IMHO.

I downloaded the preview and noticed the forward was written by William B. David (CSM, but I'm sure you all knew that). In his forward, he talked about how, one of his idols, Richard Dawkins, HATED The X-Files. Having never heard that before, I Googled it. It was then I found this video interview with, the one and only, William B. Davis.

The interview is fairly lengthy, at just under 30 minutes. But, I found it pretty interesting. He talks about how he differs from his character, and how the show balanced the views of both a believer and a skeptic.

I'm a teenage girl who looks up to Scully as a role model and is critical of the portrayal of women in media, and this episode (as well as similar ones) didn't bother me. In fact, I thought it was a pretty strong Scully episode. The scene in the house where she finds out the man on stilts is the suspect is one of the best ""Scully takes authority"" scenes, and she remains calm throughout. In fact, the scenes building up to the climax are sort of anti-damsel in distress; she uses her head and talks to Schnauz (even using German at one point) instead of  just struggling and screaming helplessly.

I really don't think The X-Files has a damsel in distress problem, because I'm pretty sure there is an even divide between Mulder in peril/Scully in peril. In fact, I'd correctly predicted it would be her turn, after Mulder was put out of action in ""Teliko"". If anything, Scully is the stronger character because she thinks through things, while Mulder's instinct and lack of thinking things all the way through often gets him in trouble. And he's often beaten up just as much, if not more, as her (""Talitha Cumi""/""Herrenvolk"", anyone?). Not to mention he cries more. So what's sad, I think, is that it's just like how people wrongly accuse people of racism just because a character (or even real person) is black and is not thought highly of al the time. She's a woman who ends up tied to a chair, and a man saves her. Despite the fact many episodes are the opposite, and she was pretty darn strong the whole episode.

So what do you guys think? Did you ever feel the show veered into a ""damsel in distress"" cliche, or do you feel the same way I do? I must admit I was a little disappointed with Fight the Future, since it was a full-length Hollywood movie, after all (otherwise, that movie was pretty great--I love how they thought, ""Hey, we've got a really big budget, so let's have a really big, cool explosion. Except let's make it the most complicated and thought-provoking explosion ever!""). Overall, I think that part of the show being about two characters who are equals is to have them share the roles of being in peril and saving the other. I usually frown when it's Scully's turn, but I must say it worked rather well in ""Unruhe"".",,False,self,t5_2rtyt,False,,,True,t3_ush14,http://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/ush14/damsel_in_distress_problem/,

And when they slept together in All Things, it may not have been the first time either. I'm not saying it is or it isn't, but I hadn't really thought about it too much. But now that I'm watching it as an adult, I'm beginning to ask these questions.

 So what are the popular theories about this? Is there any evidence to suggest a specific point in time? Or, I guess, what are your personal opinions about, not only when it began, but the nature of it until the finale? Friends with bennies? Full-blown relationship? It's strange that--even when I started actively paying attention to it-- I couldn't really figure anything out. They obviously didn't give any clear-cut answers until the second film and even that is bizarrely vague.

""This isn't my project nor is it my creative property.  I enjoyed nine years of a brilliant science fiction series called 'The X-Files' and I want to give back.  The story deserves an ending.
  
Despite the mixed reactions and poor box-office success of the second film 'I Want To Believe', I strongly feel that a final mythology-based X-Files film would be far more successful.  
  
I understand that the film most likely cannot be made to fit the timeline given at the end of the series finale, but I have absolute faith in Carter, Spotnitz, Gilligan, Bowman and anyone else on The X-Files team to make this storyline work.  I can envision the 2012 invasion date coming and going, Dana Scully feeling relief but Fox Mulder growing increasingly skeptical and paranoid. Let's include John Doggett and even Monica Reyes.  Despite any mixed reception the last season received, these two characters became a major part of the final chapter in the television series and sacrificed a lot for the sake of Mulder and Scully.  Even if it's a small part, they should be brought aboard in some capacity.  Where's William? he'd be 11 or 12 years old at this point.  Maybe even Marita or Gibson could appear...maybe a new hacker nerd, inspired by the Lone Gunmen, seeks to aid Mulder in his final quest.  
  
Either way, I consider myself a devoted fan of the series and I would like to see these characters get closure.  Let's give Mulder and Scully their happy ending and fight off the oncoming invasion!""

The deadline is June 20, 2K13, just in the small, rare case that you need to get more acquainted with X-Files or need a catch up. Also because everyone is busy all the time, except in June. 

As far as content goes, you can draw hearts around Mulder’s face and X’s through Scully’s, but please no fan fiction! I’d like this to be ‘art’ orientated, or whatever that means. Let’s do cool stuff! Please feel free to draw the monsters and aliens too, a zine full of Mulders and Scullys would probably be boring to look at (as if).

Do whatever you want to do as far as sizing goes, but right now I’m imagining a single page to be 5.5in x 8.5 in (so, an 8.5 x 11 folded in half). Whatever you do, we’ll make it work.

You can email your submissions/questions to me!

I know this is a long time away, but if this turns out good, maybe we can do a kickstarter for nice printing, distribution, etc.?

My first ep was Blood from Season 2. I also have memories of watching Ice from Season 1. Later on i watched Anasazi and was intrigued to find out whether Mulder survives or not.

The ep that got me really hooked, though, was ""Syzygy"" from Season 3. I loved the zodiac story and the Mulder/Scully banter. That prompted me to watch the rest of season 3, as well as try to catch up with the eps I had missed, and I've been a huge fan since!

The first five seasons, you could give me a name of an episode or a quick rundown of the opening scene and I could have given you a complete description off the top of my head. These episodes were memorable.

I think my catchphrase watching season 6 and 7 was (pardon the language) 'Fucking Krycek.' Whenever something was going down with 'The Syndicate' he was there.

Recently I seen some comments around here saying '8 and 9 weren't as good' and others saying 'I enjoyed them' So I decided to watch 8 again to make my own decision. 

I have come to the conclusion that these episodes are just as good and memorable. Watching the opening scenes (or shortly after the opening titles) it all came back to me and are still fun to watch.

Now I haven't finished it yet, nor moved on to season 9 but I imagine it will all remain the same.

So when my friend (a film student) noticed that a former classmate of his made a status on facebook about how he was re-editing he X-files theme, he couldn't help but inquire what for. Apparently this guy is working for a company that re-edits film from older shows for HD. The same company that did the Star Trek: The Next Generation Blue-rays. 

I mentioned this in a comment recently and someone asked about the process. For those that are also unfamiliar, I'm going to just paste my response here: 

There doesn't seem to be any official announcement of it anywhere. Which is why it's cool to find out someone is working on it. From what I understand, film (like the kind the X-files was originally shot on) is actually already in high definition. What makes it standard definition is the way that film is then scanned and edited. As you know, they didn't have HD back then, so everything was scanned and edited in SD. So shows that were originally shot on film (they did this with Seinfeld, for instance) can now be re-scanned (using the old film negatives) and re-edited for HD using today's awesome technology. It's obviously a long and arduous process to re-edit hundreds of episodes AND re-doing all the effects (so that they meet today's HD standards) so it will take a while.

Originally I had read that they didn't think the series had enough commercial value to merit all the hours that would go into re-scanning and re-editing all the old film negatives. Which is why it's really exciting to hear that they actually are going through with it. I'm hoping enough people buy the blu-rays so that they realize there IS a demand for the show and that they should go ahead and green light a third move.

Still not proof but here's a link to an article discussing it: http://tv-tastic.com/2012/11/14/the-digital-bits-the-x-files-coming-to-blu-ray-in-2013/",,False,self,t5_2rtyt,1352932164.0,,,True,t3_12dx9q,http://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/12dx9q/xfiles_in_the_early_stages_of_being_rescanned_and/,

1348063960.0,15,self.XFiles,104wrq,So I have seven episodes left of the X-Files after rewatching them for the first time since they aired...,drewgarske,18,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/104wrq/so_i_have_seven_episodes_left_of_the_xfiles_after/,"Let me begin by saying that there is just way too much that goes on in the X-Files for any single post could do justice. Just thinking about how much you'd have to talk about to really discuss the show is kind of overwhelming. 201 episodes and 2 movies. That's a lot of entertainment.

Things I've enjoyed that I didn't fully understand the first time:

-The overall scope of the government trying to cover up The Truth.
Throughout the whole show are multiple story arcs, Samantha Mulder's abduction, the black oil, corruption within the FBI and the Cigarette Smoking Man's role in everything, Scully's abduction and pregnancy. I could go on and on.
-The show is more about Scully than it is Mulder. Sure, Mulder is the crusader for fighting the Cigarette Smoking Man and government conspirators; but Scully is the one joining the X-Files when we join the X-Files. We see her journey from skeptic to believer, her transformation into a mother. While Mulder says much the same (completely awesome, all the while), Scully is the more dynamic of the two. (Not that I don't love Mulder's long, arduous journey to his truth, but I prefer Scully's).
-The show has tons of awesome guest stars throughout. Bryan Cranston , Peter Boyle, Brad Douriff, Burt Reynolds, Jodie Foster, Bradley Whitford are some that come to mind right away. But that's not even scratching the surface. We also see lots of actors/actresses before they became huge stars (Shia LaBeouf, Ryan Reynolds, Aaron Paul).
-Mulder is a dirty bird. Lots of hilarious innuendos that I never understood being a four-year-old when the show started.
-John Doggett is actually pretty badass. I remember disliking him during the originally airing just because ""That's not Mulder!"". In reality, the character and Robert Patrick's portrayal of him are brilliant episode in and episode out.
-While the writers did their best, the show is not the same without Mulder. Sorry, but it's true. A lot of what made the X-Files so special was Mulder and Scully's partnership, sexual tension for so many seasons, the believer and the skeptic (while the show tries again with Doggett and Reyes, it feels forced to keep the feeling of 'Mulder and Scully' rolling along, as opposed to a natural partnership and dynamic like it was as it developed with Mulder and Scully from the get-go.
-Skinner is also a badass. We don't get many episodes that really focus on him, and as I wish I could know more of, his past. A couple episodes are Skinner-centric (Krychek with the micro-poison in Skinner's bloodstream, in the Dead Prostitute arc [for lack of having anything better to call it] we meet his Ex-Wife and see a bit of the personal side of him). 
-The show might have been better off not having a 9th season. Let's face it, the new opening credits suck, the ending of 8 was pretty much perfect to wrap up a show with, and season 9 doesn't really bring anything great to the table. We learn more about Doggett and Reyes, but it doesn't feel right for Scully to be more of a consultant to the X-Files than actually working the X-Files. As I mentioned before, I feel like the show is more about Scully's experiences with the X-Files and path from skeptic to believer; While I love seeing Scully as a mother and her life post-X-Files case work, with Scully being off the X-Files, the show just feels forced.

I like how some of the mythology and questions from the show go unanswered. I like how much of it still remains a mystery and unexplained. The show is about the inexplicable; for some of the mythology of the show to go unexplained is perfectly acceptable and in my opinion, preferred.

All that being said, I would love a third X-Files movie. And I hope it's more about the mythology of the show as opposed to like the second movie. Also, I would love for Doggett to be in it (and Reyes too I guess). Not having them in the second movie was a let down.

I don't understand the mythology at all.  Googling around it seems I'm not the only one.   Here are just a few questions off the top of my head:

1)  Who are the alien rebels?  Are they the same species as the colonist greys?  What do they want exactly?  For some reason, I'd been under the impression the rebels were a different race that could shapeshift until 'The Unnatural' where we saw that the greys can actually shapeshift.  So does that mean, the aliens are all one race?  wtf?

2)  Alien Bounty hunters.  I guess this goes along with the first question.   They seemed to be similar to the rebels, but are working for the colonists.  Why?  Are they controlled by the black oil?

3)  What the hell is the difference between an alien replicant, a hybrid, and a super soldier?

4)  Why does it seem sometimes you can kill an alien with a gunshot in the back of the neck, and sometimes you need a big goddamn needle?  

5)  Krycek?  I don't understand his motivations at all.  What was he after?  When I google, I see people say ""he was out for himself"".   Well, duh..  but what does that even mean when you're aware of a huge alien invasion that will enslave or wipe out humanity?  Was he trying to stop it all along?  I can't believe he was in it for money or whatever.  ANd of course his 'ghost' helps Mulder in the final episode.  Why, I have no idea.  

6)  CSM.  In the final episode, he talks about wanting to see Mulder 'defeated'.   wtf?  Early on, I understood what was going on with him, but after the rebels wiped out the syndicate, I couldn't follow his motivations any more.  

7)  Supersoldiers.  WTF?

8)  Scully's baby.  WTF?   It was either supposed to usher in alien armageddon or prevent it.  I still have no idea which, or why.  More human than human?  WTF does that mean?

9)  This one just annoyed me:  FBI somehow tries Mulder without giving him a real trial (ok, fine, whatever), and gives him the death penalty.  He escapes, and then they just ""forgive"" him later for helping solve a case.  Uh, what changed exactly?  Presumably, the super soldiers are still in government and still fear exposure from Mulder.  The last movie sucked ridiculously hard.   They seemed to ignore years of plot and characterization.  The whole thing with Scully wanting to drag Mulder back in then wanting him to drop it, then threatening to leave him..  so unbelievable given everything that went before.

Anyway, I really enjoyed the first 6 seasons or so and thought I was at least sort of following along, but seasons 7-9 were quite a chore to get through.  Loved the Mulder/Scully dynamic through most of the series, but in the last couple seasons, it seemed even Gillian was just phoning it in.  I almost wish I'd stopped watching after the syndicate was killed off.   Without the scully/mulder dynamic and the syndicate, I think the show really suffered.  Or maybe I just didn't understand it.

For me, the mytharc should have ended with the Syndicate burning up at the hands of the rebel aliens at the end of One Son. From there, the mythology episodes just got too convoluted for me. But season 7 had some great monster of the week episodes--some, even, where Anderson and Duchovney weren't really needed to keep my attention (I thought Hungry was great). I was satisfied enough with how they wrapped up certain loose ends (Sein und Zeit/ Closure) and would have been happy with Requiem as a series finale... but what happened with seasons 8 &amp; 9?

Was it the lack of Mulder?

Did the quality of the writing or acting decline?

Did that sappy, melodramatic, lonely Scully theme music piss anyone else off?

As a shipper, here's a weird one, but I missed the ""are they or aren't they"" sexual tension. Once Sculder was actually happening, it was kind of disappointing. Anyone else agree?

Did the direction the mythology took confuse the crap out of anyone else? I still don't understand what a super-soldier is...

What about Scully's pregnancy? Why write that in only to take away their kid?

I get that they had to write a story around Duchovney's departure, but couldn't they just commit to something instead of being like ""The aliens took him, we're never gonna find him. Oh he's back, but he's dead. We're burying him, he's really dead... just kidding! Oh but now he has to leave again.""

So, it’s not true.”

 

David confirmed that he’s still married to actress Tea Leoni, but they are separated. Asked about the tattoo on his ring finger, he explained that it was a substitute for an actual wedding ring. “Because I would always take a ring off at work,” he said. “I don’t like wearing jewelry. So, I got this (tattoo) instead of a wedding ring.”

 

The 52-year-old actor sounded optimistic about another “The X-Files” movie. “I hope so (it happens),” he said. “I rent one of (creator) Chris Carter’s many homes when I’m shooting in LA.  He says he’s going to have a script. We’re all eagerly awaiting what he’s got up his sleeve.”

In earlier episodes, government conspiracies were mostly about aliens and suppressing those who knew. This episode brought paranoia right to the viewer's home in something they have no choice but to trust: their food.

I liked how they used a real-life example of the government modifying our food using growth hormones. ""But it was deemed safe, passed by the FDA!"" ""Pfft...who says so? The government?"" It's a great way to show the cynicism and paranoia everyday citizens have with the government, and not just a special agent who chases aliens.

Weaving in the alien DNA was great; it made you think ""If the government can get us to accept growth hormones, what are they injecting that we DON'T know about?""

But the scariest conspiracy is how the government used the entire town as an experiment. The power to quietly do this is frightening. One of the lines that hit me the hardest is when Scully hypothesizes that the government planted the Red Museum as a control group. Completely manipulating people's views and daily lives just so they had a control.

This episode shows the power of monster-of-the-week episodes to make you think just as hard as the mytharcs. Episodes like these leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, a paranoia akin to Fox's.

I'm pretty sure the dog in this episode (around 15 minutes in) is DD's dog, Blue.

Other things I've noticed:

- in the second scene from Gender Bender, when Mulder is examining the dead guy's body, the ""dead"" guy blinks. Oops.

- Nicolas Lea is also in Gender Bender as a different person than Krycek.

- in ""Blood"", after Mulder walks out of the elevator crime scene with the cop, whatever the cop says is clearly dubbed over because his mouth doesn't match his speech *at all*. I've actually noticed a few obvious dubbed lines. 

Are there any things in the show that you've noticed upon viewing them again?

As for Nicolas Lea being two different characters on the show, I have to admit that recycling actors kinda bugs me. I love Terry O'Quinn, but I hate that they used him as three different characters (cop in ""Aubrey"", SAIC that gets blown up in FTF, and shadow man or whatever in s9).

1344917266.0,10,self.XFiles,y6og7,Enough is enough is enough (xpost r/GillianAnderson),ozziesoftballs,14,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/y6og7/enough_is_enough_is_enough_xpost_rgilliananderson/,"Earlier this year, I did an interview with Out Magazine to promote a film. During the course of the interview, I grew increasingly fond of the interviewer and we settled into a very comfortable camaraderie. He seemed to be a lovely, gentle, and intelligent man genuinely interested in the life experiences of another human being. Fortunately, it was an accurate, albeit risky, character assessment.

I chose during that interview to discuss the fact that, earlier in my life, I had been in relationship with a woman. It was the first time I revealed this fact in a public forum, and I chose to do so for two reasons. One was that a woman whom I was in relationship with had died a few months beforehand and I felt, in the context of our conversation, it was safe and appropriate to bring it up. Many years beforehand, and well beyond our time together, this woman had called me out of the blue at the height of my television fame to say that she had been offered $60,000 by a tabloid to provide a picture of us together. At the time, for various reasons, not including shame, I did not want that information in the public domain and despite the fact that she was struggling to pay her rent, I asked her not to sell our story. She took what at the time I considered to be the high road. To this day I regret asking her to do that. That 60 grand would have had a greater positive effect on her life than a negative effect on mine. By discussing our relationship in Out, I felt like I was honoring her memory in some way simply by admitting its existence.

The context of our discussion within the interview was 'choice', and I was sharing how, unlike those who identify themselves as being gay, I could not speak from experience to the fear and shame that sometimes accompanies that realization, because I have always been clear that I am not. During the interview, I do not believe that I had revealed the fact that she had recently died, but in a subsequent interview with another magazine, when asked why I had suddenly chosen to discuss this area of my personal life, I gave that as the predominant reason why but was keen to move on because I really did not want this to become the new topic of conversation about my life. It’s enough that a good proportion of reporters choose to mention the unfathomably boring fact that I was voted most likely to be arrested in high school or the worryingly inaccurate detail that my ex-partner Mark made his fortune in wheel clamping. But for some reason, lets call him Interviewer #2, decided that instead of reporting this legitimate and honest reason to reveal an aspect of my past, he would use the ironically correct impression that I had liked the interviewer of Out Magazine more than him as a point of humor or false discord, it’s hard to tell which. 

So imagine my dismay/horror/disgust to discover that after an interview with the London Sunday Times, interviewer #3 turned my brief response to yes, the same question, as motivation to turn the entire article into a lesbian impregnated specimen of veritable tabloid journalism. I don’t think I’ve ever used the word ""fluid"" in my life to describe my sexuality, nor would I be so stupid or selfish to count my four days with female friends over seven weeks of family holiday as my favorite part. Do I even need to mention that over my dead body would I refer to myself as a ""property wheeler dealer""? I could go on and on. It boggles my mind that this cutting and pasting schlock can be considered legitimate journalism, and by not just an associate editor but someone who fancies herself a champion of women, or should that be the other way round. This article is a perfect example of why publicists do ask for copy approval - not to cover their own lies but to extract the lies and insinuations whipped up by the journalist. I’m not sure if I’ve ever read such a mean spirited interview ""about"" me, although it fortunately and fabulously revealed more about the spitefulness of #3 than anything at all about its apparent subject. But I digress. A bit. Imagine as well, if you will, that I was actually considering asking this woman who was pretending at the time to be friendly, if she would consider finding a way to work into the article that Mark and I had been separated for some time. Fortunately in retrospect, I did not, so when for some very strange reason, she asked if I was still with my partner, I was justifiably thrown. Had I said something that implied this? Had I said it out loud even without realizing it? Had my publicist said something? #3 so cleverly picked up on all this confusion and I have to say those pauses and ellipses may be the only verbatim detail of the entire article. Bravo. 

But this post was not intended to reveal my opinions about horrible people in pseudo-powerful positions but to shed light on an intention to share once, and once only, the fact that a seemingly straight-laced almost middle aged woman with three children can be open and shame-free about her life and love experiences and it’s okay. But what I’ve learned from this is that maybe it’s not. It’s not possible to be honest through the siphon of another. It gets abused and misconstrued and silly me.

We were fortunate we could watch all the episodes right at once, but I feel bad for people who had to tune in weekly and deal with the monster of the week episodes. Especially when some were repeats of earlier episodes with either new agents or new monsters. The only exception to this being the episode where there was a cross over with COPS.

As for the main story arch, while we were fully engrossed in it, there were some things that just didn't make sense with it or rubbed us the wrong way.

The conspiracy just didn't make any sense. The ending to the show doesn't give a good sense of finality, it just feels like it's waiting. The sub plot with Dana's miracle child didn't make much sense to me either.

2. The FBI/Government doesn't seem to bothered about a human sized parasite on the loose attempting to find a new host, while the creature is not alien wouldn't the government want to destroy it like an alien to cover up its existence? Why does Skinner want to charge it with a crime? Why does Mulder not just suggest to the FBI that it be destroyed? (It's not an alien and it's dangerous therefore I don't see why Mulder would have any reason to keep it alive other than for research)

This is essentially a chain mail art project. It will be a sketchbook mailed from Phile to Phile, and after we get through everyone, I am going to mail it to Gillian Anderson, hopefully by February 23rd to celebrate Scully’s birthday. There is no artistic talent required for this. The sketchbook can be used in any way. You can write a short story, a poem, draw, write about the ways Gillian or the X-Files has inspired you... anything. 
Everyone who wants to participate should message me with your address. I will not use it for anything except this project. I will be the only one that sees all of the addresses, however the person before you will see your address. Here’s how it will start, and here’s what you need to do: I’ll be starting the project. Let’s say that you’re next in line. I will mail the sketchbook to you, and then I’ll message you the next address on the list. (I’ll message whoever is going to be getting the sketchbook next with the address they need to mail it to). Depending on how many people respond, each person won’t be able to have the sketchbook very long if we want to get it to Gillian in February. Please let me know in your message if you are not willing to mail the sketchbook outside the continental US or if you have any other questions. 
If you are wary about giving me your address, here is a picture of me: http://imgur.com/x31fd 
I can only assure you that I am a normal, non-creepy American citizen, and vow to not abuse the information you give me. However, I do completely understand if you don’t want to participate.  

If you don’t want to participate, there is a second reason we are doing this project… Gillian is a co-founder of SA-YES (synopsis below) and she recently tweeted that they are in need of donations, so if you are able to donate please think about it! You can mail a check to the address listed on their website (sa-yes.com) or the website has other payment methods as well, such as PayPal. If you donate, and still want to participate in the project, feel free to send me a message with some kind of proof and I will write your name in the back of the sketchbook when I get it at the end so you’re still included in the project (and Gillian will see your name!).

(South African Youth Education for Sustainability (SA-YES) was founded in the UK in 2008. SA-YES provides guidance and support for marginalized young people making the transition from living in residential care homes to living responsibly and independently in South Africa. 
Young people in South Africa face a number of challenges, especially those who have lived in care without the support and guidance of loving families. While residential care homes provide much needed support for them as children, when they reach the age when they must leave care, many young people end up living on the streets. Ill-equipped to live by legitimate means, too often they end up in prison having fallen into a downward spiral of drug use and crime. 
SA-YES has developed a programme to fill the gap between care and independent living. Each young person in the programme is matched carefully with a trained mentor who offers advice and assistance with housing, employment, education and skills training, personal development and support with family and community reintegration.  
Our aim at SA-YES is to prevent young people leaving care from ending up on the streets by getting them into further education and training, so that they are employable and can sustain themselves. We source scholarships, bursaries and employment opportunities with corporate partners while at the same time facilitating and supporting them during their transition to respected, contributing members of their communities). 

Let’s have an adventure!    

UPDATE: The project has officially started and we don't have anymore room for other people due to time constraints.

X-Files CCG was Clue without the board.  Three years into the TV show and a market full of successes like Magic: the Gathering, Star Wars CCG, Star Trek CCG, Middle Earth, etc... X-Files seemed like the perfect fit of sci-fi/fantasy based card games.  Sadly their was only a Premier set with both limited and unlimted (The Truth is Out There relaunch core set) cards and one expansion that was difficult to track down.  It was easy to pick up with the Basic Rules but become more difficult with the Advanced Rules.  Basic Rules was really fun to play and you could do multiple games a session as the rounds were quick.  Draw up your hand, deploy your agents, ask questions and figure out your X-File.  The Advanced Rules introduced far more micromanagement of your resources with a set limit. 

You pick your [X-File](http://i.imgur.com/D6pFz.jpg) for your opponent to figure out.  Each X-File was made up of the 'Affiliation' of the perp, their 'Motive,' 'Method,' and the 'End Result.'  [And you had a sheet to click off what your guess is for the X-File](http://i.imgur.com/4Ozqe.jpg).Much like the who, what room, and what weapon in Clue.  Even with knowing one of the identifiers of your X-File it would still be hard to figure out what your X-File was.  Your agents going from site to site would use witnesses and equipment cards to get to the truth, fighting adversaries, events, and bluffs with combat cards.  The only downside, other then 9 different card types, was with enough playing you would run out of your X-File cards to use.  My friends and I rectified our lack of individual X-File cards by pooling all the X-File cards so that all were an option to solve.

The downfall of X-Files was each season would have only offered a few cards and very little change to the game.  They had 3 seasons to build the first set, but the first expansion seemed forced for ideas that would actually expand the universe.  It was insanely hard to get a Mulder and Scully in the Premier set, but if you had them you could almost guarantee a victory, they were that good.  But, the relaunch of the Premier set as the ""Truth is Out There"" set changed the rarity of the premier set making the game less collectible.

In today's market this type of game would almost be suited into the market of the Call of Cthulhu, Munchkin, and Fluxx type games, were all have a small themed expansion that can be mixed or played solo.  I wonder if the X-Files took their core concept and went from a collectible game of starters and boosters into more of purchasing a set expansion deck game, if X-Files could have succeeded?  

X-Files is a fun game using Basic rules, and turns a little to demanding when using the Advanced rules.  1 thumb up for casual CCG/TCG players and 2 thumbs up for X-Files and 'who-dun-it' game fans.

I am still short of all 479 cards, but have noticed they are cheap when you find them.  I am still proud that at one time my [Scully](http://i.imgur.com/ToSID.jpg) card was worth $50, should of cashed that card out back than...

When Mulder first meets Kurtzweil outside the bar, he's taking a leak on a wall in the alley. On that wall there is a poster for Independence Day, a movie released two years earlier. 

This threw me back to the actual movie Independence Day, which I have watched many times. Early on in the movie, there is a very brief, background mention of X-Files. Some people are waking up other people by phone, and one is heard to say: ""I love The X-Files too, I hope you get to see it"". 

Both of these incidents are very subtle and completely irrelevant, out of focus and not at all ""important"", but I just thought it was funny. I don't know a lot about movie advertisement, but I guess a back alley behind a bar isn't the ideal placement for a theatrical poster for a movie. ID4 is after all a movie about an alien invasion (colonisation is strongly hinted), and the nod to X-Files in that movie makes sense. Perhaps the poster in Fight the Future is just Chris Carter's way of acknowledging that nod.

Is this all correct?

Couple questions; where do the shapeshifter aliens fit in with this, are they simply the final form of the Greys shapeshifting into humans (remember the episode with the baseball player who was a Grey in the past)

The black oil seems to be alive, when it infects individuals are those individuals separate or are they all connected via some kind of hive-mind?

Tyler1851 (the newest r/xfiles mod!!!) suggested using some sort of [dice simulator](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm) to randomly pick the episode, which is a fantastic (albeit pretty nerdy) idea.

So here's the gist of it: Episode of the Month (from now on referred to as EotM) will start August 1st. There will be a new EotW at the first of every month. We (the moderators) will create an official EotW post where you can come and comment on the episode in question. And that's pretty much it. Very simple!

I've not seen much of the series (only up to season 2) but I remember seeing a TV episode when I was a kid and I think it was from the X-Files. Vague description:

I remember someone (or more likely something) digging itself out from under (or near) a lamp post on some grass during the night and then breaking into someone's house to kill them. I'm pretty sure the victim hid upstairs in a cupboard and the attacker looked like a burn victim (red, cracked skin). Really not sure about that last part btw, but I think the rest of it is correct.

At this point I have a feeling my active imagination as a child and the fact that this was 10 years ago at least may have led me to confuse this event with Tooms breaking into the house in Season 1, though it wasn't really similar at all.

Like I said, not sure if this is the X-Files but I would sure appreciate it if one of you guys could tell me the episode name/number if it is.

Thanks.

* Why is he considered a bad guy? The aliens are the enemy. The Smoking Man opposes the aliens, but he realizes that direct conflict with them is futile, so he only works with them as a cover until he can find a vaccine for the alien virus. He is trying to save at least some small part of humanity, thus he seems more like a good guy to me, a complex and fascinating character. Can anyone explain why I am wrong to think this about the Smoking Man? 

* Also, does anyone else feel that the Smoking Man’s motivation for keeping Mulder alive kept changing over time? At first he said it was because Mulder’s death would turn him into a martyr and thus help his cause. Then he seemed to spare Mulder because of affection, and he shows kindness and admiration to Mulder. But then at the end he tells Mulder “I protected you all these years, waiting for this moment, to see you broken, afraid, now you can die.” So which is it? What are the real motivations for the Smoking Man? How did he feel about Mulder?

Those letters looked familiar to me so I went back through my notes and found that [Scully's license plate](http://i.imgur.com/cOdTUzG.jpg), is a scrambled version of Y0GTZE:

* Plate numbers: 3Y7 260
* closest corrosponding letters would be: EYT ZGO
* unscrambled would be: YOGTZE

(This is referring to Scully's actual D.C. car, not some rented one).

Anyway, he wanted us to not be as close for a little while as we forget about it, and while I was initally frustrated that I wouldn't get all of my questions about what happened answered, I realized that it really doesn't matter. We both need to forget.

And so, well, the mantra ""I Want to Forget"" popped into my head, and I instantly thought of a poster similar to Mulder's. *The X-Files* has helped me cope with the past few turbulant months, and so it seemed really appropriate. I'm wondering if anyone could design me a graphic with the words ""I Want to Forget"" in the same style as ""I Want to Believe"". Above the words, instead of the UFO, will be an image of the Silence from *Doctor Who*, which symbolizes forgetting (and is also an in-joke to my other favorite show). I've already picked out [this image](http://imgur.com/IGmAp). The ""poster"" doesn't need to be large at all; I want to keep it with me in a small agenda book. I am sure I can probably re-size it to fit on Word or Publisher.

I want to thank you in advance, because this means a lot to me. Feel free to direct me to a subreddit whose users may have more photoshop experitise; I was thinking x-posting this with [r/DoctorWho](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/) but as a new episode just aired it would probably get lost.

Now I'm willing to entertain the notion that the super-soldier project was already in motion long before it came to light in the show, and that Michaud was a super-soldier during Fight the Future. If this were true, committing suicide by letting the bomb detonate wouldn't matter if he knew he was going to regenerate. This would explain his death AND his reappearance.

But what it doesn't explain is why Scully has absolutely no memory of him when she meets him face-to-face as the informant, despite the fact that he ""sacrificed"" himself to save Mulder, Scully, and the rest of the people in the building.
