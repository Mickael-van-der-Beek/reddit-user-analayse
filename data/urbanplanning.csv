2. The recently posted rage comic is I think the first time I've ever seen anything like that. If it got out of control, there may be some cause for concern, but not yet.

3. The rage comic post *is* related to planning, and is an accurate summary of what many contemporary planners feel about the 20th century.

Forgive me if a bit of this comes off as whiny, but I need to vent a little bit anyways.

I got an unpaid summer internship with a consolidated city-county planning organization in my hometown. Most of my work is mind-numbing. Take these 50 pages of this 500 page Comprehensive Plan (mind you, this is a suburb of 25K) and put it in a spreadsheet. Take this twentysomething page list of neighborhood/civic organizations and fish through the internet for contact information, then do it again using the list from a spreadsheet, then double-check it again. Spreadsheets and Outlook and a fucking gray cubicle in a gray office in dead silence okay I'll stop now.

Now, I expected this to be something of a rude awakening. I'm an unpaid, undergrad intern, and this is my first job. I do the shit that nobody else wants to do in exchange for a bullet point on the resume, course credit, and an inside look at how a planning agency functions. I get that. I understand that planning can and will get a little mundane. Mix in zoning codes, bureaucratic red tape, etc....I'm sure y'all know what I'm talking about. My supervisor takes me to meetings, for example, to see the day-to day life of a planning organization. And they're boring, and so is my work at this instant. I accept these facts due to the nature of my internship and the nature of planning and am not complaining about that.

**What concerns me, however,** is that my future in planning doesn't look any more interesting or enriching than it is now. I'm starting to realize that the idealized version of planning that I'm being taught in school isn't just idealized, but *nothing* near the truth. The smartest minds in the region, collaborating around a map and a whiteboard, brainstorming how to save Detroit. Ideas flow freely; people innovate, create, inspire. They forge something beautiful out of something mediocre. And that's all Disneyland bullshit.

What I do see is people shuffling around doing paperwork about, solemnly organizing-then-re-organizing, collecting, synthesizing, and revising whatever arbitrary documents there are, instead of.....planning. You know, the exciting stuff that keeps me awake in class. I still read up on planning, devour subject material with intensity, and vigorously debate light rail with whoever dares to try me. The passion is still there. I just enjoy spending time in the GIS room more than in my planning cubicle.

So far in the professional world, I've only seen the boring and the mundane, and I'm starting to lose hope that there is something of substance if I choose to make this my livelihood. I don't want to spend half of my waking hours committed to this type of drudgery.

Congrats if you made it this far. Now, if any professional planners could shed some light on my predicament, give me some hope, or deliver the plan ol' ugly truth, I would really appreciate it.

**tl;dr** I knew it would be boring, but it turns out to be more boring than expected and I have not yet seen any glimmer of hope that a career in planning will prove to be any different

It was vague, and intentionally so. I think it fostered some excellent discussion over the topic with 41 well written comments in response. I was going to post today about height restrictions, but I wanted to sort of poll the community first. 

How would you guys feel about weekly(ish) discussions about a controversial issue in urbanplanning? I notice we have a lot of articles, but most of them only receive 2 or 3 comments. I don't want to overstep any boundaries here, so that's why I'm posting this first. Would the mods be ok with this?

**Edit:** So, looks like the community likes the idea of the occasional discussion thread. Responding to some comments: I plan on ""moderating"" the discussion, but I wouldn't call it that. I'll try to come up with some neat topics, but I am not nearly as knowledgeable as most of you, so I really just plan to sit back and listen to the brilliance. 

I really hope the discussion overflows into the comments of articles that are posted. I am looking at the front page right now, and the liveliest discussion is three comments. There are some great articles, but let's face it, that's a bit sad. I want to kickstart this kickass community!

I am not an urban planner by profession though, just a fan :)

In my own neighborhood I have noticed that there is a dearth of commercial amenities such as a coffee house or boutiques that are in immediate walking distance. In fact, just about the only thing other than homes, schools, and undeveloped space here are some churches. 

I wanted to see if there are any known precedents for getting a small patch for this limited use zoned or exempted -- either a couple of houses or church property. I'm also interested in how the various problems were addressed after such a change in zoning was made, and what happened after the businesses were operating.

We've seen them all downtown, but not all of them have adapted to their surroundings that's for sure.

I am currently working on a new blog post about big box stores adapting their footprint and design for downtowns. I am going to be comparing pros and cons, and writing about the best and worst efforts. 

Can you share some examples of big-time big-box stores that you would normally see in a mall or in the outskirts of town with huge parking lots, that you have seen adapted or at least trying to adapt to downtown guidelines, character, and sense of place? Perhaps some horrible examples too? Photos would be awesome, and international examples welcome (I'm from Toronto, Canada).

Let's talk about height restrictions and the myriad of topics directly related to height and density limitations imposed by cities. 

A couple of days ago, an [article](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2012/04/d_c_s_height_restrictions_on_buildings_are_hurting_america_.html?wpisrc=newsletter_tis) was posted claiming that Washington DC's height restrictions are hurting America. I didn't particularly like the article, because it did little to actually backup what it claimed in its title, but the article did make a few valid points. Office space is prohibitively expensive in downtown Washington DC, among the highest in the country. Skyscrapers would help alleviate this by ~~lowering demand~~ increasing supply, and thusly, lowering office space prices. On the other hand, some people argue that Washington DC is one of the more evenly developed cities and that height restrictions push development out of the urban core and into the surrounding communities that may have otherwise languished without demand.

Another topic is infrastructure. Los Angeles has had height and density limits for the longest time in an effort to not overwhelm the cities infrastructure. This has, obviously, resulted in sprawl. 

Lastly, we have the historical aspect. Paris is perhaps most famous for maintaining its pre-skyscraper skyline, but cities such as DC, Vancouver, and until recently, Philadelphia, have had height restrictions in place to preserve a natural beauty or important historic architecture. Is there a way to balance high-rise development without compromising historic values?

I hope you guys enjoy the conversation, and I hope we have a lot of varied discussion. I'm open to suggestions for next week's topic, as well!

The movement extends to include the notion that young families with children would rather live in a dense urban core rather than a suburban single detached dwelling. I admit that moving people back into city cores is great for many reasons, but I am dubious of people who tell me that subdivision development is going to have a significant slowdown to almost nothing; I just don't buy the idea that young families want to live in a dense urban core, particularly in high-rise apartments/condos. 

I have lived in a downtown core and liked it as it suited my single lifestyle at the time. Yes, I could walk everywhere, but I didn't have any personal space, nor any outdoor space to call my own. I now live in suburbia and couldn't be happier as my fiancee and I prepare to start a family. There is no way I would want to raise a family in a high-rise downtown. I also live in SW Ontario, which may have different trends than elsewhere.

(More specifically the Houston light rail)  Anyways he HATES the train because he claims it's slow, expensive, and is a safety hazard because it's in the road.  His point is that we should use busses since the target demographics are similar and the infrastructure already exists. If we are to use trains, build them up to increase safety (on that note you can't build underground in Houston because drainage is a big problem).  THe busses can go on the expressways, and they are faster than the train, which he quoted as costing 158 million per foot.  Personally I'm a big fan of trains and he posed some interesting points against them.  I have to admit, no matter how efficient trains are in comparison to busses, I can't condone compromising public safety.  When I think of trains in the city I'm thinking like the Disney monorail (which he said he didn't understand how they moved so many people so quickly, but Houston's train was slow) or the Dutch trolly systems are pretty feasible.

I think infrastructure changes lives more than people realize, and I think that the designers in charge of a city layout have the power to change the world. It sounds like the ideal job for me, but here's the catch:

My father is an architect, so I have a lot of experience with the brutal reality of his industry. From viewing his struggles, I've come to the conclusion that TV and media romanticize architecture as an art form, but in reality, the great bulk of the profession is frustrated clients, tight budgets, and cubicle offices. He loves to create beautiful things, and he is good at it, but he doesn't get as many chances as he'd like. He says that his creativity is only about 5% of his effort.

So here's the question: is there a similar fault with urban planning? To the urban planners out there, what's the typical day at the office like? Do you work for a city, or are you on your own? What are the public's biggest misconceptions of your trade?

I'm working on a school project where I have to come up with a theoretical community plan for an area in/around my city. I chose a small town just on the outskirts that is a primo example of single-family big box bedroom community.

I was hoping that you all might have some good examples of what a quintessential small town in North America looks like. I've hunted around Vermont and Maine on google maps but haven't had much luck (save for St. Johnsbury VT; gorgeous). I'm needing this for comparative reasons but also for my own interest.

Think of a place with the classic courthouse square, small streetside 
retail, steeples, grid network of roads. Somewhere you could see your grandparents going to buy woven baskets or maple syrup.

Thank you for any examples you come up with!

It's seems to me that usually you start with a little rougher neighborhood, maybe with a lot of crime, higher minority population, lower income; then it slowly transitions to a hip neighborhood, more bars and restaurants, younger demographic overall with more money than their predecessors but not a whole lot more; finally you end up with the newer development that the younger people and students can't afford.

It's a serious question and not meant to be snarky or anything--would it be fair to say that the people getting priced out of their neighborhood by the ""young urban professional"" crowd share some of the responsibility for the gentrification?

Before doing it, it'd be great to get some feedback from people here.

**Concentrations** - Are there certain specializations that are more marketable and in-demand? Likewise, are there some that are overly impacted and competitive?

**Schools** - I've seen the list of the top 10 programs, but are there accredited schools I should avoid? I've heard mixed input whereby some people seem to think schools matter a lot, while others say it's more important to match your interests with the program's location. On a side note, does anyone have input about UW-Madison's program? The location is pretty appealing to me.

**Employment** - Does a willingness to relocate anywhere in the US significantly increase employment prospects, or is it the norm to be unemployed for a long period of time subsequent to graduation regardless?

**Admissions** - Again, I've heard some mixed messages concerning how difficult it is to get into various graduate programs. I went to a respected university as an undergrad (sociology major/urban studies minor) and graduated with a 3.9 GPA. However, my GREs concern me a bit. The verbal (83rd%) and quant (68th%) seem fine, but I totally bombed the writing with a 3.5 score (30th%). Should I be worried?

Any info/advice is much appreciated.

Before posting this, I looked at the top 100 posts to make sure this wasn't covered recently.

I would especially appreciate any advice from those of you who have ever been in a position to hire a young planner.

1. The general theme I've gathered from previous threads is to get a master's degree in planning. Check. I've done that. I went to a PAB-accredited planning program and have a 3.98 GPA. I also had a planning internship and served in the Peace Corps in a planning capacity. I've even been invited by one of my professors to write a chapter in the second edition of a book she's editing. So what am I doing wrong? For those who have been in a position to hire: what are you looking for? (The HR departments of places I've applied to tell me that I am eligible for interview consideration, but I haven't gotten to that next level.)

2. (This one is geared to American planners.) Apart from education, I find the AICP process to be a Catch 22. One must have 2 years experience in a planning capacity, of which I am just shy. Most of the jobs I've seen have require AICP certification (or have a strong preference for applicants who do), but I can't get certified without first getting hired. Do any of you have tips on qualifying for AICP while just shy of the experience?

3. What I've been told from others (in planning and elsewhere), networking is a big deal. The only problem is I have no idea where to begin with networking. All I know of are APA-sponsored events, which can be really expensive, requiring membership, or in come cases, conferences. Where else can I go to meet planners? With this in mind, my latest approach has been marketing. I made a resume/portfolio website and business cards, but where do I go about sharing the goods?

Thanks in advance for any advice you might be able to bestow upon me.

**TL;DR: I Can't land an interview, have an MSP, just shy of AICP certification eligibility, who do I give my networking cards to?**

**Update:** Just got a call from a potential employer who likes what I have to offer. The source of that contact was through my graduate program's alumni network. I shared my resume, it was passed around for a few months, as soon as a position opened up on their website, I applied to show interest, and I got a call the next day.

How do you get ahead in the planning field when it feels like the jobs are few and far between?  

I graduated with my Masters in City and Metropolitan Planning last year after an (unpaid) internship in planning and several other internships before that.  I was struggling to find work after I graduated for almost a year until last May.  The job I got is with a government agency in my state, but is low-paying and has absolutely nothing to do with my field.  I know having a job is better than no job at all, but I am getting worried that I am going to get pigeon-holed into work that it not my field.  

I apply and apply to job after job and continue to be rejected.  So-called ""entry-level"" jobs ask for years of experience I do not have which is vexing.  I believe my internships should at least count as some experience though.  I have tried contacting my local American Planning Association chapter to try and volunteer so I could build a network.  It ended up being a bit disorganized though when I tried to help and so I am pretty sure this is a dead end too.

The state I live in is conservative with a large majority being one religious culture that I am not, so it is already an uphill battle.  I cannot just get up and move since I just barely got work.  

Is there any advice you can provide on how to keep up my skills and possibly finally get work in the field?



UPDATE:  Do you guys think maybe I would be better off going back to school again for something else such as architecture?  Not to sound like a downer, but it sometimes seems as if being in the planning field is probably not very advantageous by itself.  I am 27 now though, so if I do end up doing something that big, it will be a big deal financially and other ways too.

I currently have a list of schools I'm looking into any wondering if anyone has gone or knows anyone who goes to these schools.

Cleveland State University is currently my dream school with Rutgers University very close behind.

In no particular order


*  University at Albany, SUNY
*  University at Buffalo, SUNY
*  Michigan State University
*  Wayne State University
*  University of Michigan
*  University of Cincinnati
*  University of Wisconsin-Madison
*  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
*  University of Minnesota-Twin Cities
*  Cleveland State University
*  Rutgers University



SUNY would be the cheapest as I'm a state resident. All these schools offer various specializations that I'm interested in with CSU and Rutgers offering them all.

I want to specialize in all (yes all)


*  Community Development
*  Economic Development
*  Historical Preservation
*  Housing (mostly centered on public housing)
*  Urban regeneration
*  Transportation (mass transit/public transit)

My goal (and my thesis) is the revival of Buffalo, Cleveland and Detroit using socialistic means under a capitalist disguise. Further along encourage a massive and aggressive centralizing and concentrating policy.

I'm currently quite new to urban development, but I've found myself quite intrigued with the idea of ""building up vs building out"". I live in Melbourne, Australia, and we seem to have this horrendous problem by which we just seem to keep building out without improving and perfecting what we already have closer to our CBD.

I was simply wondering if anyone could lead me to some good (**yet simple**) articles on the positives and negatives of urban sprawl.

One overlooked fact that I've found was a statement here:

""Griffith University has found that people on the fringe suffer real financial difficulties,” he says. “It’s fine for a house and land package to cost only $230,000 but does the customer realise they will spend 25 per cent of their income getting to and from work and getting the milk? People don’t think of this.”

I thought this was quite a unique perspective on the issue, and I was merely wondering what the arguments were for both building out and building up!

Often it's like the second city serves as a large ghetto for the first. Is there a term for this phenomenon? Is it a studied trend? Am I hallucinating?

Some examples:

* Philadelphia - Camden
* Manhattan - Newark/Bronx
* San Francisco - Oakland
* Chicago - Gary, Indiana
* Los Angeles - Long Beach (LA is big enough to have its own multi-mile ghettos, too)

I think in the case of a lot of large cities in the U.S. and in the rest of the world, a megaopolis includes the poorer sub city and richer one together—Mexico City, Cairo, Tokyo, etc are just so large that there isn't a city distinction, but it's bigger than just a neighborhood or ghetto. 

Any thoughts? Is there terminology for this?

So I guess my main question, in short, is this: why are so many suburban streets designed to be -- the way I perceive them -- inefficient and hard to navigate? I can see how they may be relatively aesthetically pleasing, but my points still stand.

Besides, as a separate point, doesn't isolating subdivisions also create traffic problems by delineating which streets are arterial and should (and certainly do) receive more traffic)? Would a well-connected grid design solve this? And to what extent do warped grids provide both aesthetics and efficiency?

And a final question: what can be done to fix inefficient streets? I mean, I'm not sure how expectable it is that entire subdivisions could be feasibly torn down and rebuilt in a short amount of time as people would try to hold on to their property and whatnot, unless, more efficient street designs used the original streets as their base and simply extended on them.

Any suggestions Reddit?,ender6,16,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/dggmp/just_finished_my_masters_in_planning_and_am/,"So I finished my Masters in Urban Planning just before the summer, and after taking some time off to regain sanity through travel, I am now about to embark on the wonderous voyage of career discovery. So I figured where better to ask advice than from my favourite people...Reddit people.

I guess what I'm wondering is if anyone could suggest good resources that list jobs in urban planning or, even better, if anyone could suggest any specific planning firms or city positions that would be good to apply for. While I am very interested in gaining more experience on the design side, I remain open to just about any position or role that I would find compelling, while allowing me to gain a foothold in the industry and gain that valuable 'first-job' experience that I know I need. 

I currently live in Toronto, but would be willing to move just about anywhere in the world, provided the job is interesting enough. In school, my focus was on urban design, implementing renewable energy and using media as part of the planning process. While I would be very comfortable continuing along these lines, I am also very open to diving into other aspect of the planning field.

Any suggestions are welcome, and here's to hoping that for once, the power of Reddit can be harnessed to help improve my life...beyond the wonderful time sink it always provide.
