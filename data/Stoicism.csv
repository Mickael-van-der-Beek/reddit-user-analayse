Find the answers below, a big thanks to Dr John Sellars for taking the time to talk with us!

&gt;Do you see any evidence that Stoicism may have some ties to Buddhism, either in its original creation or similarities?  Can Stoicism be considered a ""Western"" version of ""Eastern"" philosophy?

I'm not aware of any evidence for a direct influence from the East on Stoicism, although there is evidence for Eastern influences on other ancient Greek schools (Pyrrhonism, Neoplatonism). There are certainly similarities between aspects of Stoicism and Buddhism, but I'm wary of trying to see Stoicism as simply a Western version of Buddhism because there are significant differences also. While there may be parallels on the ethical or practical side, they are built upon very different physics and metaphysics, and in both cases I think it's important to ground the ethics in the metaphysics. I'm a bit wary of thinking in terms of 'Western Philosophy' versus 'Eastern Philosophy' but I think it's safe to say that ancient Greek philosophy has more in common with Eastern philosophical traditions than modern academic philosophy does. So this is not restricted to Stoicism. Thomas McEvilley has tried to map out some of these connections in his book The Shape of Ancient Thought. 

&gt;What was the role of Heraclitus in Stoic philosophy?  Do you find AA Long's description of Stoic modifications to Heraclitus' concepts persuasive?

It seems that Heraclitus was an influence on Stoic physics, and we have evidence that the Stoic Cleanthes wrote a commentary on Heraclitus. A. A. Long maps out the issue very well. The big problem of course is that our evidence for Heraclitus is so fragmentary and its interpretation so contested that saying that the Stoics were definitely influenced by him doesn't give us very much to help us in trying to understand Stoic physics any better. Perhaps ironically, the Heraclitean flavour of Stoicism comes out most clearly at the other end of the history of ancient Stoicism, in the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. 

&gt;Is there any evidence (or any reason at all) to believe there has been a ""Stoic Sage"" or ""fully Stoic"" person? Is it believable that someone has been Stoic (limiting attention to what is in one's control, seeing oneself as given a certain fate) to the point of overcoming nearly all of life's suffering?  It seems that Epictetus, for instance, often used Zeno and Socrates as exemplars, would they have been considered sages by the later Stoics?

If you take seriously all of the attributes listed for the sage then it seems that no one could ever live up to the ideal. Perfect rationality is quite a challenge! Having said that (and going back to the Buddhist parallel), there are people in the Buddhist tradition such as monks who do seem to embody their tradition's ideal, but it is notable that in order to make such progress they have has to isolate themselves from daily life. There may well be similar examples in the Christian monastic tradition too. With those parallels in mind perhaps it would be possible to attain something close to the ideal that the Stoics propose. The fact that referring to concrete examples seems to help also helps to explain why someone like Epictetus continually points to examples like Socrates and Diogenes. It also helps explain the value placed on role models in ancient philosophy. I think Epictetus' response to the question would be something like ""It doesn't matter if a perfect sage ever existed, but Diogenes was certainly closer to the ideal than you are, and if he could get that far then so can you"". 

&gt;Do you think Aristotelian ethics are (at least partially) compatible with Stoicism?

Insofar as Stoicism and Aristotelianism both offer a eudaimonistic ethics there is certain amount of shared ground. But when one gets into the details there are a number of important points of difference, regarding weakness of will, the emotions, and the role of externals. Reading the Nicomachean Ethics, it is really the last of these that stands out for me as something distinctly un-Stoic and quite at odds with, say, what we find in Epictetus. But having said that, there is always something new to learn from Aristotle's ethics and would never be without a copy close to hand. In antiquity the relationship between the two positions was a preoccupation of Antiochus and is discussed at length in Books 4 and 5 of Cicero's On Ends. 

&gt;What is a good explanation of the motto ""follow nature""?

This is a very complex question but as a beginning I would say that it is worth remembering the earlier Sophists who contrasted things 'according to nature' with things 'according to convention'. The same distinction was taken over by the Cynics who of course were an important influence on the early development of Stoicism. So I would say begin by thinking about what the alternative would be, namely following the customs and conventions and values of society. I think that's a better way into the issue than trying to begin by grasping an abstract conception of nature and wondering what the ethical implications might be. To return to Epictetus and role models, I guess he would point to Diogenes the Cynic and say ""that's what living according to nature looks like"". 

&gt;If someone was interested in studying the Stoics for the first time, would you point them to an Academic work first, such as your book, Stoicism (Ancient Philosophies) or something by a modern practitioner like William Irvine or Keith Seddon?

Neither; I'd point them to Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca! Something like Seneca's On the Shortness of Life would be a fine place to start. The opening chapter of Epictetus' Discourses is also nice. I like Marcus' Meditations, although I know it is not to everyone's taste and some people find it melancholic. My book is aimed at people already quite interested who want to know the details and I wouldn't claim it to be inspirational, but hopefully informative! I think Irvine does a fine job in bringing Stoic ethics to a popular audience. 

&gt;Do you see any paradoxes or contradictions for the modern practice of Stoicism? How can they be reconciled?
&gt;Is there a difference between modern rationality and Stoic rationality?
&gt;Is there any value in studying Stoic cosmology and physics today?

Let me take these three questions together. I see no great paradox in the modern practice of Stoicism; on the contrary I think it has a lot to offer. There is a sense in which in the ancient world the philosophical schools offered a sort of moral and practical guidance for life that later became a task taken over by Christianity. The decline in religious belief in (parts of) the West has left some people feeling that something important has been lost along the way. While some people have turned to Eastern traditions, others have found the cultural distance a hurdle. So in an increasingly secular society Stoicism (and there is no reason why this couldn't apply to, say, Epicureanism too) offers something potentially attractive. The big question is whether trying to draw on Stoic moral and practical guidance involves a commitment to certain aspects of their physics that are patently false. And that is in fact a current scholarly issue of debate, involving Julia Annas and others: just how much does Stoic ethics depend upon Stoic physics? My own view is that it probably depends on the physics quite a lot, but not in a way that makes it untenable today. I needn't believe in the periodic conflagration of the world in order to benefit from Stoic thinking about the emotions, for instance. 

&gt;I feel that constantly rephrasing Stoic precepts is an important practice. If not, words and precepts start to sound idiotic and meaningless. What's your opinion on it?  Do you agree with Hadot that the Meditations can be best understood as the result of this practice for Marcus Aurelius?

Yes I do think that the repetition of key ideas is a vital part of digesting these sorts of philosophical ideas, as it is with learning or mastering anything new. Seneca and Marcus are quite explicit about this and I wrote about it a bit in my book The Art of Living. Continually rephrasing is probably very helpful too, as it stops the process becoming a mindless repetition of doctrine. Sometimes rephrasing can bring an idea into focus and massively increase its impact too. I'm sure this is what Marcus was doing in the Meditations.

1376234402.0,67,self.Stoicism,1k5alg,So I made mistake today. A case study.,bebestman,78,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1k5alg/so_i_made_mistake_today_a_case_study/,"I was walking along, listening to music with my ear plugs. Crossing the street, I look left, nothing there so I move forward when I hear a tram honking violently at me. I look right and see the driver furiously hitting the brakes when I jump back as I am scared. (Strangely trams have only one rail here and can move in both directions. Looking left I missed it obviously as it came from the right) After having given the tram place to move forward, the driver comes to a full stop and is obviously enraged. ""What the fuck was that?"", he yelled at me. I have since long taken my headphones out I answer ""I'm sorry"" in the most polite tone I can muster. To which his reaction was ""You're sorry? THAT'S BULLSHIT!"" apparently expecting me to react in some other way, gesticulating wildly and then moving on.

I felt bad, ashamed, when I realized that I wasted the time of the people driving on the tram. *I shouln't have wasted their time by my absentmindedness.* I was angry that the driver yelled at me after I apologized sincerely. *He shouldn't have yelled at me, that was demeaning.* Nothing happened, mind you, except the driver having spilled his coffee.

Immediately after this episode I started to think of the Stoic arsenal. *It was he who was angry and it was he who yelled at me. Why should it affect me?* I remembered the Enchiridion: *Anytus and Melitus may kill me indeed, but hurt me they cannot.* I have no control over him yelling but I choose to be upset about it. For good measure, I went over the episode in my head thirty times in sets of ten until I was thoroughly bored by the scene. Finally I thought of how Socrates would have reacted and indeed I think he would have reacted with indifference as there was no blood spilled, only coffee.

The anger was gone completely, so there was the shame left. *I can not affect the past since the moment it happened, I can affect my behaviour in the future though.* So I looked up what accidents pedestrians with earplugs are prone to and decided to never wear earplugs again when I am moving on the street. I condemned the practice of walking around practically deaf to the world but at the same time I realized that I acted on my best knowledge as otherwise I would have acted differently. Now I know better. I can only control my actions, not the results.

To further reduce any anxiety, shame or anger I thought of the Enchiridion again: *For example, when our neighbor's boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, ""These things will happen."" Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was broken.[...]*

Finally I realized this was a great opportunity for some negative visualization. *I could have been hurt badly, lost a limb, my mental capacities or my life in so many ways. It could have been a short, sharp pain, then I'm gone, internal bleeding, a bleeding in the brain. But to my great fortune I was gifted another day!""* Finishing that thought I smiled. The weather seemed better, the sunshine was nicely warm on my skin, the air fresh, the buildings somewhat more beautifully made. I have now finished this case study and will talk to my father, who today seems nicer on my gifted extra day.

I hope this case study helps. Feel free to critique it.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_1k5alg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1k5alg/so_i_made_mistake_today_a_case_study/,

**Starting points for newcomers to Stoicism**
=========================================

There is no ""one best"" work for a modern person to study to learn about Stoicism. Instead, there are a variety of resources, the suitability of which depends on exactly what the reader is looking for. The following list includes common choices, and ones regular posters on /r/Stoicism have found particularly useful.

The [*Enchiridion* of Epictetus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchiridion_of_Epictetus)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One element of Stoic psychological training was the regular reading, rereading, and memorization of short, powerful reminders and exhortations of the principles and practical advice of the philosophy. The *Enchiridion* is a collection of such reminders compiled by Arrian from the lectures of his teacher, the Stoic philosopher Epictetus.

The *Enchiridion* consists of very short and easy to read sections. The sections are in no particular order, and thus the Enchiridion is suitable for browsing, and selected sections can be good subjects for contemplation. For many modern Stoics, the *Enchiridion* is the primary (and sometimes only) source of inspiration.

The *Enchiridion* was, however, intended as a set of reminders for those already familiar with Stoicism, not an introduction to those unfamiliar with it. As a result, it is easy to misinterpret: several modern misconceptions about Stoicism arise from reading the Enchiridion without the assumed background.

In some cases, this may actually be an advantage: a Christian reader may, for example, find it easier to supplement their own religion using the Enchiridion when more free to interpret it in their own way.

Many good translations of the *Enchiridion* are available. Elizabeth Carter's is in the public domain, and is available [on-line](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html). Discussion of alternate translations can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/r99d5/whats_your_favorite_epictetus_translation/).

The *Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius
------------------------------------

In addition to reading and memorizing exhortations and reminders of the type compiled in the *Enchiridion*, Stoic practice sometimes included writing exercises. The *Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius are thought to the a compilation of such exercises. 

The strengths and weaknesses in studying Stoicism through the *Meditations* are similar to those of studying the *Enchiridion*: the entries are short, approachable, and easily browsed, and also (in good translations) often beautiful and inspiring. At the same time, they were composed for the author himself, not an external audience, so much is lost in context, and significant background information is assumed.

In spite of these similarities, the *Meditations* and the *Enchiridion* can be very different works; Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus each had their own personalities and idiosyncrasies, and these show in their works.

Modern readers are encouraged to read the [IEP entry on Marcus Aurelius](http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/) to help interpret his book.

There are many good translations of the *Meditations* available. Long's translation is the public domain and available [on-line](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Thoughts_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus), but most readers prefer other translations. Those of Gregory Hayes and Robin Hard are both popular. For more discussion, see [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/137knd/survey_best_meditations_by_marucs_aurelius/).

The Letters and Essays of Seneca the Younger, and the Essays of Cicero
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Seneca the Younger (Lucius Annaeus Seneca) and Marcus Tullius Cicero were both wealthy and politically powerful Roman statesman and orators who wrote extensively on philosophy. Seneca was educated in Stoicism and regarded himself as a Stoic, and although Cicero regarded himself as a Sceptic (a rival school to the Stoics), he wrote essays that attempt to portray the Stoic point of view, or contrast several philosophies (including Stoicism) with each other. 

Unlike the *Enchiridion* and the *Meditations*, which were written in Greek, Seneca and Cicero wrote in Latin, and appear to have had a wider, more ""popular"" audience in mind. Their essays and letters present more systematic and exhaustive discussions of their topics, and are less cryptic and open to misinterpretation.

Because they were in Latin rather than Greek, they were more influential for significant periods in European history. Shakespeare, for example, is likely to have been familiar with Seneca and Cicero.

Some essays particularly recommended for newcomers to Stoicism include:

* De Tranquillitate (On Tranquility of Mind) by Seneca the Younger
* De Brevitate Vitae (On the Shortness of Life) by Seneca the Younger
* De Officiis (On Duties) by Marcus Tullius Cicero

In addition, a collection of the Seneca the Younger's Letters is also highly recommended.

Moses Hadas's [*The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca*](http://openlibrary.org/books/OL13549785M/The_stoic_philosophy_of_Seneca) is a good place find the recommended essays by Seneca, and a selection of his letters.

The Guided Tour: *Stoic Serenity: A Practical Guide to Finding Inner Peace* by Keith Seddon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keith Seddon's book is not a ""stand-alone"" introduction to Stoicism. It is intended to be read in conjunction with Robin Campbell's translation of Seneca in *Seneca: Letters from a Stoic* and Robin Hard's translation of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations*, and provides extensive discussion and quotes from other Stoic authors such as Epictetus to help the reader interpret and understand the philosophy as a cohesive system.

Modern accounts aimed at modern practice
-----------------------------------------

### *The Stoics: A Guide for the Perplexed* by Andrew Holowchak

Holowchak's book is a short, stand-alone account of Stoic philosophy by a modern expert. It quotes classical authors extensively, and provides many references for follow-up reading, but does not use the classical sources as its primary vehicle, and works as a stand-alone source. A longer review can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/17de2m/review_of_holowchaks_the_stoics_a_guide_for_the/).

### *A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy* by William Irvine

Irvine's book is controversial among readers of /r/Stoicism. It is one of the most clear, easy to read, and practical accounts of Stoicism available, but critics feel it waters down and distorts many central elements of the philosophy.

Additional discussion of Irvine's book can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1b6akp/i_thought_william_irvines_book_on_stoicism_was/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/rkzyd/william_irvine_criticism_and_appreciation_post/).

Historical Stoicism
-------------------

The emphasis in the accounts listed in the previous section are strongly influenced by the intent to provide a basis for modern practice. Several aspects of historical Stoicism are both challenging for modern readers to understand, and unlikely to be adopted even if understood. However, these elements, including Stoic cosmology, theology, and physics, were fundamentally important to many of the Stoics themselves, and understanding them is essential to understanding their place in the history of science and philosophy. Those interested in Stoicism primarily as history will therefore be better served by books with a different emphasis.

### *Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy* by R. W. Sharples

Sharples's book is a short, easy to read account of Stoicism and its primary rivals, Epicureanism and Skepticism. The three philosophies have much in common, and describing them jointly, pointing out their similarities and differences, is a useful approach in understanding any of them individually. 

### *The Stoics* by F. H. Sandbach

Sandbach's book is short, but very dense. It provides significantly deeper discussion of Stoic physics and cosmology than the other sources listed here, and spends more time discussing the subtleties in translating the various Greek technical terms than most.

### *Stoicism* by John Sellars

Sellars' book is another good general introduction to Stoicism that includes more emphasis on logic and physics than many others.

**Additional classical sources**
============================

In addition to the classical sources listed as ""starting points,"" there are a number of additional classical sources that can provide a significantly deeper and more systematic understanding, and provide material for further study.

Unfortunately, the original canon of books written by Chrysippus, Zeno of Citium, and other leaders of the school are lost. A number of fragments and second-hand accounts remain, and there are two collections that make these accounts available:

 * Long and Sedley's [The Hellenistic Philosophers](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2959440W/The_Hellenistic_philosophers)
 * Inwood and Gerson's [The Stoics Reader](http://www.hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/the-stoics-reader)

In addition to the *Enchiridion*, Arrian took more extensive notes on Epictetus's lectures. Many of these survive, and Carter's translation is public domain and available [on-line](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html).

Seneca the Younger wrote a number of essays not listed in the ""starting points"" section, and most collections of his letters are not comprehensive. Tracking down these remaining letters and essays is recommended.

Cicero left a considerable body of work, and *De Officiis* is not the only one of relevance to those studying Stoicism. Other recommended works by Cicero include the [*Tusculan Disputations*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988), [*Stoic Paradoxes*](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674993846), and [*On the Nature of the Gods*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum). 

[Diogenes Laërtius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius)'s *Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers*, an encyclopedia of the views of different philosophers written sometime between 200 CE and 500 CE, includes an account of Stoicism in the [entry on Zeno of Citium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D1). The entry can be challenging to read, and Diogenes Laërtius has been criticized for not completely understanding the views he is reporting, but this second hand account is valuable in that it is an attempt to give a balanced overview of the views of the school, rather than the the opinions of one specific author on the topics that interest that author.

Finally, [miyatarama's really long Stoic book list with reviews](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/t3gw8/my_really_long_stoic_book_list_with_academic/) is a good resource for finding additional material.

**On-line resources**
=================

 * Wikipedia has several entries covering topics related to Stoicism. Helpful entries include the ones on [Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism), [eudaimonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) (particularly the section on [eudaimonia in Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia#The_Stoics)), [arete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete), and [natural law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) (particularly the section on [Stoic natural law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#Stoic_natural_law)).
 * The [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/) has many good entries related to Stoicism. Of particular interest are those on [Stoic philosophy of mind](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/) and [Stoic ethics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/), [Epictetus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epictetu/), [Marcus Aurelius](http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/), [Cicero](http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/), and [Chrysippus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/).

**Sources for Stoic exercises**
===========================

Good resources for exercises a modern person inspired by Stoicism might want to practice include:

 * Pierre Hadot's [Philosophy as a Way of Life](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2743948W/Philosophy_as_a_way_of_life) and [The Inner Citadel](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2743931W/The_inner_citadel)
 * The final chapter of Holowchak's [The Stoics: A Guide for the Perplexed](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL6215232W/The_stoics)
 * Stoic Week's [Living the Stoic Life booklet](http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/2012/11/22/living-the-stoic-life-the-booklet/)
 * Elen Buzare's [Stoic Spiritual Exercises](http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/elen-buzar%C3%A9/stoic-spiritual-exercises/paperback/product-18840210.html)
 * William Irvine's [A Guide to the Good Life](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL15597577W/A_Guide_to_the_Good_Life)
 * Donald Robertson's [The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy](http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Cognitive-Behavioural-Therapy-Psychotherapy/dp/1855757567), particularly in combination with one of the many CBT self-help books, such as Ellis's [How To Control Your Anxiety Before It Controls You](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL15040739W/How_to_control_your_anxiety_before_it_controls_you)
 * Donald Robertson's [Build Your Resilience](http://www.amazon.com/Resilience%252013How-Survive-Thrive-Situation-Yourself/dp/1444168711)

This lists presents the sources roughly in order of scholarly historical rigour to practical applicability; the Hadot books are an historical analysis rather than instructions, while books later on the list include more speculation, other influences, and original extrapolation, but are also easier to read and have instructions that are more practical to follow. Placement on this list is not intended as a criticism of any of them. The ancient sources are sufficiently thin that an author has to make a compromise between the two, and the different authors had different goals, and so compromised differently. The last books on the list do not even present themselves as being primarily about Stoicism, but are rather modern psychological self-help books influenced by (and perhaps discussing their relation to) Stoicism.

The latter said to him, “Didn’t they say anything to you?” He replied, “No.” The old man said, “Go back tomorrow and praise them.” So the brother went away and praised them, calling them, “Apostles, saints, and righteous men.” He returned to the old man who said to him, “Did they not answer you?” The brother said, “No.” The old man said to him, “You know how you insulted them and they did not reply, and how you praised them and they did not speak; so you too, if you wish to be saved, must do the same and become a dead man.

“At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: ‘I have to go to work–as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for–the things which I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?’

–But it’s nicer here…

So you were born to feel “nice?” Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?

–But we have to sleep sometime…

Agreed. But nature set a limit on that–as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota. You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash and eat.”

But one man is possessed by an avarice that is insatiable, another by a toilsome devotion to tasks that are useless; one man is besotted with wine, another is paralyzed by sloth; one man is exhausted by an ambition that always hangs upon the decision of others, another, driven on by the greed of the trader, is led over all lands and all seas by the hope of gain; some are tormented by a passion for war and are always either bent upon inflicting danger upon others or concerned about their own; some there are who are worn out by voluntary servitude in a thankless attendance upon the great; many are kept busy either in the pursuit of other men's fortune or in complaining of their own; many, following no fixed aim, shifting and inconstant and dissatisfied, are plunged by their fickleness into plans that are ever new; some have no fixed principle by which to direct their course, but Fate takes them unawares while they loll and yawn - so surely does it happen that I cannot doubt the truth of that utterance which the greatest of poets delivered with all the seeming of an oracle: ""The part of life we really live is small.""

With that in mind, I would like to share my thoughts as respectfully as possible and I invite others to share their wisdom for the comfort and understanding of all of us here.

The first response I have to this event is that it is natural and understandable how much suffering the survivors and family members of the dead and injured are going through.  I think there is a real danger if Stoicism is misrepresented as suggesting that the pain is not real or that any individual should ""just get over"" their feelings.  Our understanding of these sorts of events is so ingrained and reinforced by our culture and media and even our biology that perhaps it is unavoidable.  Suppressing these feelings is not the healthy response, to me the best response is to acknowledge the feelings and seek to correct our understanding to alleviate the suffering.

Suffering happens because our understanding is not aligned with living according to Nature or ""the way things are.""  The telling response to this event seems to largely be, how could this happen?  For the religious, perhaps it is, how could a loving God allow this to happen?  The cognitive dissonance occurs when we try to fit this tragedy into our framework of ""how things are supposed to be.""  This is the result of thinking that good and bad exist outside of what is within our control.

Let's take death as an anchor topic in this situation.  In this example, the perpetrator thought the good thing to do in his situation was to kill his mother and innocent children and adults at his mother's workplace before taking his own life.  Whether this understanding came about as part of a brain chemistry imbalance, a reinforcing spiral of poor decisions, or likely a combination of the two, I think it is clear that this person suffered an existential horror that few can imagine.  Even those without the benefit of Stoic understanding would say that he was a ""miserable human being.""

Contrast this with those who risked their lives in order to save the lives of others.  Though I have not read much about it in the press, I'm sure in the coming days we will be told of courage under fire from otherwise normal people that behaved as heroes.  More often than not, these people respond that they ""only did what anyone would have done,"" because this is how they understand the world.  But they are mistaken, not everyone understands deep within themselves that life is not the highest good.  The highest good is excellence and virtue, in this case risking one's life for others.  We recognize this as a society in cases such as this, but it is not necessarily ingrained in all of us.  For Stoicism, ingraining this understanding is one of our greatest goals.

Understanding the death of innocent children is the most difficult for me.  However, for those of us not directly affected, what is different from the average 6 children between 0-14 that die every day in traffic accidents?  I think it has to do with expectations, we have accepted on some level that over 2,000 children die from auto accidents every year.  We have obviously not accepted in the same way that children can die in school at the hand of another.

I think the key concept is understanding deeply, certainly, (in a way that I don't yet) that death is a part of life.  It is unavoidable, and it is not *bad.*  Bad enters the picture when we misunderstand what is good and bad, by thinking that we should control what we do not, or by not taking absolute responsibility for what is in our control.

I welcome other thoughts or corrections of my own, and wish the deepest comfort for everyone that is currently suffering.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_14vpzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/14vpzs/stoic_responses_to_todays_shooting/,

I thought we should end the year with a recap post in light of the very successful year in Stoicism.  First I will start with some statistics, because I find numbers fascinating.  Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/X4IRv.jpg) with what we are able to see as moderators.

Here is the 3rd party analysis courtesy of [stattit](http://stattit.com/r/stoicism/).

I note with gratitude that [ThatsOK](http://www.reddit.com/user/ThatsOK) ranks as the top poster thanks to tirelessly posting the fragments and lectures of Musonius Rufus and now the letters of Seneca several times a week for most of 2012.  I personally have benefited from having these reminders every few days of the rich legacy left to us.  Many thanks for the enormous efforts of ThatsOK and other contributors.

With that as a good segue, here are some of my most notable posts from 2012:

[We interview Dr John Sellars](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/tgjxf/dr_sellars_interview_with_rstoicism_answers_here/). This is our highest ranked post ever and also got to the top of /r/depthhub and got crossposted to several other subreddits. Also, this is the first time we interacted with a well-known academic in our subject, we have subsequently added frequent contributor and author Donald Robertson, [SolutionsCBT](http://www.reddit.com/user/SolutionsCBT) who also did a great [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/yj38d/drobertson_philosophy_of_cbt_qa_answers_now/).

[cleomedes](http://www.reddit.com/user/cleomedes)' comment in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/130oka/weekly_stoic_qa/) made it to the top of depthhub and I believe is responsible for the spike in activity a month ago.  We really enjoy doing the weekly Q&amp;A and intend to continue into 2013.  Thanks to all the great questions and answers and to the user that first suggested doing them over 6 months ago (I tried to figure out who this was, if anyone remembers please let me know!)

[The Stoicweek project](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/13n25h/download_the_stoic_handbook_designed_for_living/) created an excellent free pdf and a format for living like a Stoic as part of a virtual community for a week in November. Apparently a longer 2 week program will take place in Spring 2013.

Author and self-described media manipulator, Ryan Holiday, [announces his new book](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/yp6td/just_sold_my_first_book_about_stoicism_to/) about Stoicism here in /r/Stoicism.

Stoicism gets it's [first extremely popular meme](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/qtxlj/you_act_like_mortals_in_all_that_you_fear_one_of/). I reposted this to getmotivated and several other subreddits as a quote. This along with other users' crossposting activities led to the increase of users and traffic in /r/stoicism that began in March of 2012. We have grown from a subscriber base of 150 users to over 3,600 since then.

1) A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William Braxton Irvine

&gt;This was my re-introduction to stoicism and led me to think that I should incorporate stoic practice into my life.  It is not academic but I have not found major contradictions with my understanding of the ancient texts.
Review by Walter M. Roberts III [here](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-09-28.html)

2) Stoic Serenity: A Practical Course on Finding Inner Peace by Keith Seddon

&gt;Originally intended as a correspondence course, this book has writing assignments and uses Meditations and Letters from a Stoic as references.  You will want to use the versions I have listed below if possible since the page numbers and paragraph references are specific to those editions.

3) Meditations (Wordsworth Classics of World Literature) by Marcus Aurelius (Robin Hard translation)

&gt;Edition used by Seddon's book/course above.

4) Letters from a Stoic (Penguin Classics) by Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Robert Campbell translation)

&gt;Edition used by Seddon's book/course above.

5) Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life by A. A. Long

&gt;This is extremely valuable for intermediate/advanced study.  I recommend it after having a good understanding of stoicism and Epictetus so that the issues and interpretations have some context. 
Review by William O. Stephens [here](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2002/2002-11-03.html)

6) Stoic Studies (Hellenistic Culture and Society) by A. A. Long

&gt;Review by William O. Stephens [here](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1997/97.11.20.html)

7) The Hellenistic Philosophers, Vol. 1: Translations of the Principal Sources, with Philosophical Commentary by A. A. Long and David Sedley

&gt;AA Long is one of the living experts, if not THE living expert on Stoicism.  I have seen this text referenced multiple times.

8) The Hellenistic Philosophers: Volume 2, Greek and Latin Texts with Notes and Bibliography by A. A. Long and David Sedley

9) Hellenistic Philosophy: Stoics, Epicureans, Sceptics, Second edition by A. A. Long

&gt;According to one of the comments, this contains different material from the The Hellenistic Philosophers Vol 1 &amp; 2.

10) Stoicism (Ancient Philosophies) by John Sellars

&gt;This is an introductory academic text that is used in the College of Stoic Philosophers - the online course offered by NewStoa.

11) The Art of Living: The Stoics on the Nature and Function of Philosophy (Bc Paperbacks) (Bristol Classical Paperbacks) by John Sellars

&gt;Review by Brad Inwood [here](http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23760/?id=1424)

12) Musonius Rufus: Lectures and Sayings by Cynthia King

&gt;Rufus was Epictetus' Stoic teacher, and this recent book is the first translation of his complete extant works.

23) Discourses, Books 1-2 (Loeb Classical Library) by Epictetus

24) Epictetus: Discourses, Books 3-4. The Encheiridion. (Loeb Classical Library No. 218) by Epictetus

&gt;Everyone who has read multiple translations recommends these two volumes.

25) Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot (Reprint ed.) by James B. Stockdale

&gt;I read the text of two lectures Stockdale gave along these lines, I am interested in reading more.

26) A Man in Full by Tom Wolfe

&gt;Stoicism in a modern narrative format, my understanding is that Wolfe's conversations with Stockdale inspired this book.

&gt;In another example, Ye-Leiu Chu-Tsai was a court official in Peking and was captured when the Mongols conquered the city in 1213. His family was part of the Liao Dynasty, which had only recently been overthrown by the Kin Dynasty. Genghis Khan remarked that he should be glad the Mongols had avenged his family, to which Ye-Leiu Chu-Tsai replied that he could not rejoice in the defeat of the Emperor he had pledged to serve. Genghis Kahn, impressed by this loyalty to a defeated Emperor, made him an adviser. Ye-Leiu Chu-Tsai dissuaded Genghis Khan from invading India in 1218 (one can only imagine the carnage had the Mongols invaded India). He also dissuaded Genghis' successor Mongke from a genocidal plan to massacre much of the population of China. Author Michael Prawdin remarks ""If we reckon the importance of a statesman by the number of human lives he saves from destruction, Ye-Leiu Chu-Tsai was certainly one of the greatest statesmen the world has ever known."" He acquired enemies, but his association with Genghis Khan made him untouchable, even after Genghis' death. Only after Ye-Leiu Chu-Tsai died about 1240 did his enemies dare to act. He was accused of embezzlement. A search of his effects showed that in years in the center of Mongol power, with daily access to the most powerful conquerers on the planet, he had amassed no personal wealth.

&gt;Consider the moral dilemmas of a good man in the service of a brutal conqueror. Ye-Leiu Chu-Tsai must certainly have seen and heard of many things that repelled him to the core. Outright opposition would be suicide - worse yet, it would have been ineffective. On the other hand, preserving our own lives to be able to help others can very easily degenerate into a rationalization for cowardice. Navigating between the two extremes requires both physical courage to stand up in the face of overwhelming power, and moral courage to face relentlessly our own tendency to rationalize and to question our own motives constantly.

I enjoy thinking about such things, because I feel that we are constantly called on to live virtuously within unjust systems.  I often think about the amount of change possible to such systems, and the manner in which I strive to make change and do the right things most efficiently and effectively without being attached to the results.

I, at least, am doing this: in my old age I have ceased to desire what I desired when a boy. To this single end my days and my nights are passed; this is my task, this the object of my thoughts, – to put an end to my chronic ills. **I am endeavouring to live every day as if it were a complete life**. I do not indeed snatch it up as if it were my last; I do regard it, however, as if it might even be my last. 

2 The present letter is written to you with this in mind as if death were about to call me away in the very act of writing. I am ready to depart, and I shall enjoy life just because I am not over-anxious as to the future date of my departure.

Before I became old I tried to live well; now that I am old, I shall try to die well; but dying well means dying gladly. See to it that you never do anything unwillingly. 

3 That which is bound to be a necessity if you rebel, is not a necessity if you desire it. This is what I mean: he who takes his orders gladly, escapes the bitterest part of slavery, – doing what one does not want to do. The man who does something under orders is not unhappy; he is unhappy who does something against his will. Let us therefore so set our minds in order that we may desire whatever is demanded of us by circumstances, and above all that we may reflect upon our end without sadness. 

4 We must make ready for death before we make ready for life. Life is well enough furnished, but we are too greedy with regard to its furnishings; something always seems to us lacking, and will always seem lacking. To have lived long enough depends neither upon our years nor upon our days, but upon our minds. I have lived, my dear friend Lucilius, long enough. I have had my fill;**[1]** I await death. Farewell.

A big thanks to Donald Robertson for his time and sharing his knowledge of CBT and Stoicism!

&gt;From the standpoint of modern psychology, how effective do you think the Stoic ideal of ""choosing to change your perception/judgement of events"" is? For instance, Marcus Aurelius telling us to ""Choose not to be harmed, and you won't feel harm. Don't feel harmed, and you haven't been"".

I think the success of cognitive therapy (and related procedures like REBT) has arguably provided strong, albeit somewhat indirect, support for this aspect of Stoicism. Cognitive therapy and Stoicism are certainly not identical but the notion that by changing our judgements we can alleviate emotional suffering is common to both, it's fair to say. There are also a number of other similarities explored in [The Philosophy of CBT](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1855757567). Cognitive therapy has been found effective mainly for depression and anxiety disorders, although behaviour therapy appears capable of producing similar results. It's difficult to quantify ""how effective"" changing judgements is in numerical terms, in general, but to pick a specific example, systematic reviews of clinical trials for social phobia show a mean success rate of about 75%. Social phobia is a diagnosis where challenging thinking seems particularly important because it's mainly an issue concerning the fear of negative evaluation by others, so it's ""very cognitive"" in nature as a problem.

Challenging beliefs can be useful for specific phobias (such as fear of certain animals or insects) but it's generally accepted that behaviour therapy is the treatment of choice for these sort of problems. That said, actually facing our fears, which is the basis of behaviour therapy, seems to be something the ancient Stoics would have been happy to endorse as part of the discipline of overcoming irrational fear and desire. Likewise, part of the rationale for premeditatio malorum (the premeditation of adversity) may have been that it helps us to learn to tolerate painful feelings (such as anxiety) in a manner not unlike the modern behaviour therapy technique called ""imaginal exposure"".

On reflection, I'd say that although it's natural to see Stoicism as resembling cognitive therapy it also appears to have some overlap with modern behavioural interventions as well - something that probably deserves to be explored more fully. For example, there's growing evidence that ""behavioural activation"", a form of behaviour therapy that encourages clients to clarify their personal values and act more consistently with them is effective for depression. That should be of interest to Stoics because in practice it's similar to the Stoic emphasis on contemplating the nature of virtue and continually trying to act in accord with it, in the present moment. So cognitive therapy and changing judgments are not, in my view, the only parts of Stoicism that can find (indirect) support in modern clinical trials.

&gt;How have the different views of Stoicism and Buddhism influenced you?

Do you mean the different views found within each tradition? When I was about fifteen years old, I started reading books on meditation and philosophy. I became interested in martial arts (taekwondo) and Buddhism. However, roughly in parallel, I read Plato and other philosophical classics. Initially I found Buddhism provided me with practical guidance on lifestyle and strategies such as meditation, and that was something that academic philosophy didn't explicitly offer. However, I gradually came to realise that there were traces of a more ""practical"" dimension to Western philosophy. 

My eyes were finally opened when I read Pierre Hadot's books on ancient philosophy. I was first interested in Plotinus but soon came to realise the Stoics offered the most explicitly ""therapeutic"" system of philosophy, or the one that most suited my personal preferences. I felt, as I believe others do, that the Stoics were virtually the last piece of Western philosophy I'd become acquainted with because there was no real mention of them made during my time as a philosophy student at university. I remember thinking ""Why, oh, why did I read this last rather than first?!"" I actually studied Buddhist philosophy in some depth as part of my original philosophy degree - but no Stoicism! I prefer Stoicism to Buddhism because, to put it bluntly, I find it easier to understand. The Stoics come from a culture that's less alien to me and their texts are more accessible. The influence of Western philosophy is already all around us, our language is full of concepts and phrases that seem to be derived from that tradition. So I feel Stoicism is something that we should all have an affinity with already in the West, and that Buddhism tends to become bastardised in the West. I'm not sure how to summarise the differences influence but one example, if this doesn't seem too trivial, is that I wouldn't meditate by doing ""mindfulness of breathing"" now because I'd rather just focus attention directly on the activity of my faculty of judgement and the way I respond to impressions, following the Stoic teachings more than the typical Buddhist methods.

I'm just recently 21, but the past 2 years have been rough. Was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (a chronic disease) a couple of years ago, am losing my hair at a young age, almost died from an aortic aneurysm (I was saved though!), I had one ex who OD'd on heroin, and another one I sent to jail for trying to stab me. I have been living at home alone (had to leave university) while I recover from open heart surgery.

In short, my life was easy and fun up until 2 years ago. I had never really dealt with hardship. When I first started looking to philosophy for answers I looked to Buddhism. It's very similar to stoicism, but ultimately it didn't work for me. I'd say the main difference is that it's hard to apply realistically. It doesn't fit in accordance to one's *own* nature. Anyway, my dad gave me ""Letters From A Stoic"" (the one with some of Seneca's 140 letters).

It blew my mind how clearly his advice came through and made sense, even after 2000 years. The human condition really hasn't changed at all in that time. Anyway, I just wanted to say how much I like this philosophy and subreddit. Definitely keep posting. For the first time in years, I am happy.

I have little formal education and no one to discuss this with IRL.  I figured it would not hurt to put it out there.  This is how I have been interpreting Stoicism and trying to live my life in accordance with these principals.  I must say that my life has improved tremendously.

From what I've gathered, one of the core principals of Stoicsim is defining what is in your control and what is not.  This can be viewed as a dichotomy or a trichotomy; what is in my control, what is not in my control, and (optionally) what is partially in my control.  I view the universe as a series of probabilities.  It is possible for the atoms of my dog to spontaneously rearrange themselves so that my dog becomes a monkey, but it is so unlikely that it is not worth considering. But it is possible.  I can bet on black five times in a row and it can come up green every time.  Again, not very likely but possible - and now worth considering.

The same is true in my daily life.  I can increase the likelihood of events happening but I cannot make them happen. The key is my desires and expectations.  If I practice at golf enough I may become a better golfer. I may become worse by focusing on a mechanic.  I may get a better score as a result of it, but my opponents can still beat me.  As long as my goal is to enjoy the outdoors, then I have won the game.

I even reject the notion that my desires, emotions, and reactions are 100% in my control.  They are effected by externalities, chemicals, etc.  All I can do is work as hard as I am able to direct those impulses positively and increase the likelihood that they be Stoical and sensible.  I will not be 100% successful at this, but as successful as the universe (Zeus?) allows.

By starting with the understanding that even if I do everything I am able to achieve these ends I may fail, I will not (once I have divorced myself of the immediate emotional reaction) be dismayed by the failure. It was always a possibility and I'd be a fool to ignore that. Nothing is certain.

By estimating the likelihood of an event I can sensibly devote resources to it.  If I vote, I will increase the likelihood of improving society, but I cannot say for certain that I will.  If I am caring, loving and mindful of my SO, I will increase the chance of us enjoying a better life, but not with certainty.  But by not doing those things I am almost certainly harming those prospects, or at least not improving them.

Perhaps I am not clearly articulating myself, but I welcome a dialog.  I should also note that this is just one aspect of how I interpret and implement Stoicism.  Perhaps this is not Stoicism at all, but I like the idea of it being flexible enough to allow for modifications.  To me it doesn't matter if it is even Stoic any more, but I still find tremendous value in the readings of the classic Stoics.

TL;DR Nothing is 100% within or outside of my control. They are simply more or less likely based on my actions and desires and it is wise to play the odds.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_1ka0bd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1ka0bd/quantum_stoicism/,
1374518257.0,30,self.Stoicism,1itu51,"On grief for lost friends - Seneca, Letter 63",ThatsOK,34,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1itu51/on_grief_for_lost_friends_seneca_letter_63/,"1 I am grieved to hear that your friend Flaccus is dead, but I would not have you sorrow more than is fitting. That you should not mourn at all I shall hardly dare to insist; and yet I know that it is the better way. But what man will ever be so blessed with that ideal steadfastness of soul, unless he has already risen far above the reach of Fortune? Even such a man will be stung by an event like this, but it will be only a sting. We, however, may be forgiven for bursting into tears, if only our tears have not flowed to excess, and if we have checked them by our own efforts. Let not the eyes be dry when we have lost a friend, nor let them overflow. We may weep, but we must not wail.

2 Do you think that the law which I lay down for you is harsh, when the greatest of Greek poets has extended the privilege of weeping to one day only, in the lines where he tells us that even Niobe took thought of food?**[1]** Do you wish to know the reason for lamentations and excessive weeping? It is because we seek the proofs of our bereavement in our tears, and do not give way to sorrow, but merely parade it. No man goes into mourning for his own sake. Shame on our ill-timed folly! There is an element of self-seeking even in our sorrow.

3 ""What,"" you say, ""am I to forget my friend?"" It is surely a short-lived memory that you vouchsafe to him, if it is to endure only as long as your grief; presently that brow of yours will be smoothed out in laughter by some circumstance, however casual. It is to a time no more distant than this that I put off the soothing of every regret, the quieting of even the bitterest grief. As soon as you cease to observe yourself, the picture of sorrow which you have contemplated will fade away; at present you are keeping watch over your own suffering. But even while you keep watch it slips away from you, and the sharper it is, the more speedily it comes to an end.

4 Let us see to it that the recollection of those whom we have lost becomes a pleasant memory to us. No man reverts with pleasure to any subject which he will not be able to reflect upon without pain. So too it cannot but be that the names of those whom we have loved and lost come back to us with a sort of sting; but there is a pleasure even in this sting. 

5 For, as my friend Attalus**[2]** used to say: ""The remembrance of lost friends is pleasant in the same way that certain fruits have an agreeably acid taste, or as in extremely old wines it is their very bitterness that pleases us. Indeed, after a certain lapse of time, every thought that gave pain is quenched, and the pleasure comes to us unalloyed."" 

6 If we take the word of Attalus for it, ""to think of friends who are alive and well is like enjoying a meal of cakes and honey; the recollection of friends who have passed away gives a pleasure that is not without a touch of bitterness. Yet who will deny that even these things, which are bitter and contain an element of sourness, do serve to arouse the stomach?"" 

7 For my part, I do not agree with him. To me, the thought of my dead friends is sweet and appealing. For I have had them as if I should one day lose them; I have lost them as if I have them still.

Therefore, Lucilius, act as befits your own serenity of mind, and cease to put a wrong interpretation on the gifts of Fortune. Fortune has taken away, but Fortune has given. 

8 Let us greedily enjoy our friends, because we do not know how long this privilege will be ours. Let us think how often we shall leave them when we go upon distant journeys, and how often we shall fail to see them when we tarry together in the same place; we shall thus understand that we have lost too much of their time while they were alive. 

9 But will you tolerate men who are most careless of their friends, and then mourn them most abjectly, and do not love anyone unless they have lost him? The reason why they lament too unrestrainedly at such times is that they are afraid lest men doubt whether they really have loved; all too late they seek for proofs of their emotions. 

10 If we have other friends, we surely deserve ill at their hands and think ill of them, if they are of so little account that they fail to console us for the loss of one. If, on the other hand, we have no other friends, we have injured ourselves more than Fortune has injured us; since Fortune has robbed us of one friend, but we have robbed ourselves of every friend whom we have failed to make. 

11 Again, he who has been unable to love more than one, has had none too much love even for that one.**[3]** If a man who has lost his one and only tunic through robbery chooses to bewail his plight rather than look about him for some way to escape the cold, or for something with which to cover his shoulders, would you not think him an utter fool?

You have buried one whom you loved; look about for someone to love. It is better to replace your friend than to weep for him. 

12 What I am about to add is, I know, a very hackneyed remark, but I shall not omit it simply because it is a common phrase: a man ends his grief by the mere passing of time, even if he has not ended it of his own accord. But the most shameful cure for sorrow, in the case of a sensible man, is to grow weary of sorrowing. I should prefer you to abandon grief, rather than have grief abandon you; and you should stop grieving as soon as possible, since, even if you wish to do so, it is impossible to keep it up for a long time. 

13 Our forefathers**[4]** have enacted that, in the case of women, a year should be the limit for mourning; not that they needed to mourn for so long, but that they should mourn no longer. In the case of men, no rules are laid down, because to mourn at all is not regarded as honourable. For all that, what woman can you show me, of all the pathetic females that could scarcely be dragged away from the funeral-pile or torn from the corpse, whose tears have lasted a whole month? Nothing becomes offensive so quickly as grief; when fresh, it finds someone to console it and attracts one or another to itself; but after becoming chronic, it is ridiculed, and rightly. For it is either assumed or foolish.

14 He who writes these words to you is no other than I, who wept so excessively for my dear friend Annaeus Serenus**[5]** that, in spite of my wishes, I must be included among the examples of men who have been overcome by grief. To-day, however, I condemn this act of mine, and I understand that the reason why I lamented so greatly was chiefly that I had never imagined it possible for his death to precede mine. The only thought which occurred to my mind was that he was the younger, and much younger, too, – as if the Fates kept to the order of our ages!

15 Therefore let us continually think as much about our own mortality as about that of all those we love. In former days I ought to have said: ""My friend Serenus is younger than I; but what does that matter? He would naturally die after me, but he may precede me."" It was just because I did not do this that I was unprepared when Fortune dealt me the sudden blow. Now is the time for you to reflect, not only that all things are mortal, but also that their mortality is subject to no fixed law. Whatever can happen at any time can happen to-day. 

16 Let us therefore reflect, my beloved Lucilius, that we shall soon come to the goal which this friend, to our own sorrow, has reached. And perhaps, if only the tale told by wise men is true**[6]** and there is a bourne to welcome us, then he whom we think we have lost has only been sent on ahead. Farewell.

Stoic philosophers seem to advocate mental exercises and many users seem to perform them, discussing them here and elsewhere, though I'm curious if Stoic philosophers advocated physical exercises and if any users perform them.

Cato, for instance, ""walked around Rome in unusual clothing with the goal of getting people to laugh at him. He learned to subsist on a poor man’s rations. He went barefoot and bareheaded in heat and rain. He learned how to endure sickness in perfect silence"" (from [here](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/10/09/stoicism-for-modern-stresses-5-lessons-from-cato/)).

Diogenes of Sinope (though not a Stoic), ""hugged cold statues"" (from [here](http://www.iep.utm.edu/cynics/)).

More from the Cynics:

&gt;Antisthenes praised toil and hardship as goods; Diogenes of Sinope walked barefoot in the snow, hugged cold statues, and rolled about in the scalding summer sand in his pithos; Crates rid himself of his considerable wealth in order to become a Cynic.

Seneca, similar to, ""hugging cold statues"", had cold baths (though I'm unsure if he did so for Stoic reasons) and said, ""Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: "" Is this the condition that I feared?"""" (though I'm unsure if he practiced it).

Inspired by ascetic philosophies, I have began to perform at least one of the exercises above. I am curious about others. Have any of you, /r/Stoicism, physically implemented Stoicism, and how have you?

More from [Stoicism for Modern Stresses: 5 Lessons from Cato](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/10/09/stoicism-for-modern-stresses-5-lessons-from-cato/):

&gt;What was the point? Pain and difficulty could build endurance and self-control. Cato was drilling himself to become indifferent to all things outside the magic circle of the conscience. He could be ridiculed, starving, poor, cold, hot, sick—and none of it would matter. As the Stoic philosopher Epictetus taught: “Where is the good? In the will. Where is the evil? In the will.”

This was not written for those already familiar with Stoic literature, it's for the new people.

I did not come to Stoicism from the thoughtlessness of a life untouched by Philosophy. I came to it after many years and much personal investment in seeking the ""truth"".

I do not accept all precepts of traditional Stoicism. I'm an atheist, a materialist, and a nihilist. I came to Stoicism as a ""next step"" from nihilism.

My nihilism necessitated Stoicism. My atheism and materialism makes Stoicism all the more critical to my life. I have one mortal life to live. Nothing awaits me beyond the grave.

Stoicism is how I try to make the best of it. My approach is syncretic but there are some essentials to Stoicism that the new people would benefit from learning.

Stoicism is not about being cold and unfeeling, but rather the elimination of suffering. The parts of human experience that cause suffering are inevitable, but the experience of suffering is not. Stoicism is not asceticism.

First, lets address the dichotomy of control. There are things you can control and things you cannot. An emphasis on the *actionable* parts of life is a key part of Stoicism! The 12-stepper Serenity Prayer is an echo of this part of Stoicism.

There are three aspects to the dichotomy of control. Most people speak in terms of twos, but really it's three.

1. Accept what you cannot change. Train yourself to be unharmed and untouched by the ebb and flow of day to day life. This is another form of control, except it's internalized to be over yourself!

2. Learn to exert discipline over what you can control. This can only come from self-discipline.

3. Once you learnt self-discipline you can begin to expand the sphere of what you can and cannot control. You learn to do so in a way that doesn't expose you to unhappiness. A good way of summarizing this is in a frugal saying: ""Don't buy what you can't afford to lose.""

Interpersonal relationships are one of the more complicated components of Stoicism. I will explain this by way of analogy and hope that more experienced contributors in this subreddit can expound on it.

Dog owners get attached to their pets. Mature and experienced dog owners know that taking responsibility for a dog doesn't just mean time and money expenditure but an emotional burden too.

The dog will die. The Stoic dog owner doesn't just count the cost of dog food, they count the cost of losing that dog. This does *not* mean not getting a dog, it means getting a dog accepting that you will someday lose that dog. Developing the virtue and discipline to immunize yourself to that suffering is key.

Stoicism for me is about engaging with a human, emotively *alive* life in a mature, disciplined, and rational manner.

For me it's passion without self-destruction. Temperance without apathy.

If you have to ""shut off"" to keep clear, you're *losing*.

Stoicism has echoes in almost all corners of history (cf. Buddhism, Zen). Stoicism is not ""the way"", but rather a profound concentration of wisdom that has echoed all throughout human civilization for millennia.

For the more well-read members of r/Stoicism:

Read some Epicurus.

We don't have any original (early/middle) sources for Stoicism and it's my suspicion that modern understandings of Stoicism are colored by Roman conceptions of virtue.

Seen [Here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Stoicism/permalink/495242147195560/) if you can access it... It was posted by Michael Daw.

""I wanted to offer a brief explanation of the concept of Indifference in Stoicism, as there seems to be a lack of clarity around the issue. First of all, Stoics (as in people who practice Stoicism) are NOT called to be 'indifferent'. We are not asked to adopt an indifferent (uncaring) attitude towards anything. 

There are a couple of concepts that seem to be rolled into the common use of the word 'indifference', neither of which are correct. First there is the concept of an 'indifferent', which include things like money, life, health, death, family etc. Unfortunately, many have taken the wrong meaning from this, and believe that we should not concern ourselves with these things (the ancient Stoics taught that we should be responsible, even grateful, for the conditions and people in our lives.) What the ancient Stoics meant by a thing being 'indifferent' is that it had no intrinsic moral value. Money is neither good nor bad, it is not inherently virtuous or vicious, but rather completely neutral. It can be used either virtuously or viciously, but in itself it has no moral value. In my Stoic classes, I use the term 'morally neutral' instead of 'indifferent' to avoid this confusion. 

The second is the Stoic concept of 'apatheia' which is also often confused with 'indifference'. Stoic apatheia isn't about apathy. Apatheia means 'no irrational emotional states', with the emphasis on 'irrational.' Stoics encourage the experience of rational emotions, such as joy, serenity, caution, love etc. as these are born of a rational understanding of the events around them. 

The key is to remember that Stoics DO involve themselves with externals. We use them, gain them, let them go, develop relationships and even care for and cherish them. What we DON'T do is allow their presence or absence determine whether or not we are virtuous. They are morally neutral, and therefore do not cause us to behave well or badly, or force us to succumb to irrational passions, lust, anger, jealousy, etc. It is our beliefs about them that lead to irrational passions.""",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_1cuyhg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1cuyhg/excellent_explanation_of_the_concept_of_stoic/,

You would have to work very hard to rearrange your life to remain functional — learn braille, take special precautions when walking around town and when cooking eggs at home, etc. — but in the end, you could surely survive and even become happy again if you were blind. 

But now open your eyes. SURPRISE!! YOU HAVE THIS BONUS OF SIGHT!!!. Wow, you were already doing just fine in your blind life, but now you have working eyes too? What an incredible life – you are truly blessed with more than you even need.""

And another great one I found on Reddit a while back but can't seem to find the link to so I'll have to type out:

Close your eyes. You imagine you're on your bed in your 90s, old, weak, and unable to take care of yourself. You can't do anything with ease anymore and everything tires you out.

As for me, Lucilius, my time is free; it is indeed free, and wherever I am, I am master of myself. For I do not surrender myself to my affairs, but loan myself to them, and I do not hunt out excuses for wasting my time. And wherever I am situated, I carry on my own meditations and ponder in my mind some wholesome thought. 

2 When I give myself to my friends, I do not withdraw from my own company, nor do I linger with those who are associated with me through some special occasion or some case which arises from my official position. But I spend my time in the company of all the best; no matter in what lands they may have lived, or in what age, I let my thoughts fly to them. 

3 Demetrius,**[1]** for instance, the best of men, I take about with me, and, leaving the wearers of purple and fine linen, I talk with him, half-naked as he is, and hold him in high esteem. Why should I not hold him in high esteem? I have found that he lacks nothing. It is in the power of any man to despise all things, but of no man to possess all things. The shortest cut to riches is to despise riches. Our friend Demetrius, however, lives not merely as if he has learned to despise all things, but as if he has handed them over for others to possess.**[2]** Farewell.

*Admit not sleep into your tender eyelids*
*Till you have reckoned up each deed of the day*
*How have I erred, what done or left undone*?
*So start, and so review your acts, and then*
*For vile deeds chide yourself, for good be glad*.
                                  
**[1]**

Keep hold of these lines for practical use, not to declaim them as a cry like 'Paean Apollo'. Again in a fever we must be ready with judgements for that; if we fall into a fever we must not give up and forget everything, and say, 'If I ever study philosophy again, may the worst befall me! I must go off somewhere and attend to my poor body.' Well, but does not fever come there? What does studying philosophy mean? Does it not mean preparing to face events? Do you not understand then that what you are saying comes to this, 'If I go on preparing to bear events quietly, may the worst befall me'? That is as though a man should give up competing for the pancration because he has been struck. But there it is possible to leave off and so escape a beating: but what profit do we get if we leave off studying philosophy?

What ought one to say then as each hardship comes? 'I was practising for this, I was training for this.' God says to you, 'Give me a proof, whether you have kept the rules of wrestling—eaten the proper food, trained, and obeyed the trainer.' After that, are you going to play the coward when the moment of action comes? If now is the time for fever, take your fever in the right way; if for thirst, thirst in the right way, if for hunger, hunger aright. Is it not in your power? Who will hinder you? The physician will hinder you from drinking, but he cannot hinder you from thirsting aright: he will hinder you from eating, but he cannot hinder you from hungering in the right way. 'But am I not a student?'

Why are you a student? Slave, is it not that you may be happy and have peace of mind? Is it not that you may conform to nature and so live your life? What hinders you in a fever from keeping your Governing Principle in accord with Nature? Here is the test of the matter, this is how the philosopher is proved. For fever too is a part of life, like walking, sailing, travelling. Do you read when you are walking? No. Nor do you in a fever: but if you walk aright, you have done your part as a walker; if you bear your fever aright, you have done your part as a sick man. What does bearing fever rightly mean? It means not to blame God or man, not to be crushed by what happens, to await death in a right spirit, to do what you are bidden; when the physician comes in, not to be afraid of what he may say, and if he says, 'You are doing well', not to be overjoyed: for what good is there in that? What good had you when you were in health? It means not to be disheartened if he says, 'You are doing badly'; for what does 'doing badly' mean? It means drawing near the dissolution of the soul from the body. What is there to fear in that? If you do not draw near now, shall you not draw near later? Is the world going to be turned upside down by your death? Why then do you coax the physician? Why do you say, 'Master, if you will, I shall get well'? Why do you give him occasion to lift his brow in arrogance? As you give the shoemaker his due in regard to the foot, the builder in regard to the house, why do you not give the physician his due (and no more) in regard to the paltry body, for the body is not mine and is naturally dead? This is what the moment requires from the man in a fever: if he fulfils these requirements, he has what is his own.

It is not the business of the philosopher to guard these outward things—paltry wine or oil or body—but to guard his Governing Principle. How is he to regard outward things? Only so far that he does not concern himself with them unreasonably. What occasion is left then for fear? What occasion for anger, what occasion for fear concerning things that are not our own, nor of any value? For the two principles we must have ready at command are these: that outside the will there is nothing good or evil, and that we must not lead events but follow them. 'My brother ought not to have behaved so to me.' No, but it is his business to look to that; however he may behave, I will deal with him as I ought. This is my part, that is another's: this no one can hinder, that is subject to hindrance.

For it is difficult to walk on a tight-rope, and not only difficult but dangerous as well: ought we for that reason to practise walking on a tight-rope or setting up a palm-tree, or embracing statues? By no means. Not everything that is difficult and dangerous is suitable for training, but only that which is conducive to what is set before us as the object of our effort. What is set before us as the object of our effort? To move without hindrance in the will to get and the will to avoid. And what does that mean? Not to fail in what we will nor to fall into what we avoid. To this end, therefore, let our training be directed: for since it is impossible without great and continuous effort to secure that the will to get fail not and the will to avoid be not foiled, know that, if you allow training to be directed to things lying outside and beyond the will, you will not get what you will to get nor avoid what you will to avoid.

And since habit has established a strong predominance, because we have acquired the habit of turning our will to get and our will to avoid only to what lies outside our control, we must set a contrary habit to counteract the former, and where impressions are most likely to go wrong there employ training as an antidote.

I am inclined to pleasure: in order to train myself I will incline beyond measure in the opposite direction. I am disposed to avoid trouble: I will harden and train my impressions to this end, that my will to avoid may hold aloof from everything of this kind. For how do we describe the man who trains? He is the man who practises avoiding the use of his will to get, and willing to avoid only what is in the sphere of the will and who exercises himself in what is hard to overcome. And so different men have to train for different objects. What is it to the purpose here to set up a palm-tree, or to carry about a hut of skins or a pestle and mortar? Man, train yourself, if you are arrogant, to bear with being reviled, and not to be annoyed when you are disparaged. Then you will make such progress that, even if you are struck, you will say to yourself, 'Imagine that you have embraced a statue.' Next train yourself to use wine properly, not for heavy drinking—for there are men misguided enough to train for this—but first to abstain from wine, and to leave alone pretty maids and sweet cakes. Then, if the proper time comes, you will enter the lists, if at all, to try yourself and learn whether your impressions overcome you as before. But to begin with, fly far from enemies that are stronger than you. The battle is an unequal one when it is between a pretty maid and a young man beginning philosophy. 'Pot and stone', as the saying is, 'do not agree.'

Next after the will to get and the will to avoid comes the sphere of impulse for action and against action: where the object is to obey reason, not to do anything at the wrong time or place, or offend the harmony of things in any other way.

Third comes the sphere of assents, concerned with things plausible and attractive. For, as Socrates bade men 'not live a life without examination', so you ought not to accept an impression without examination, but say, 'Wait, let me see who you are and whence you come', just as the night-watch say, 'Show me your token.' 'Have you the token given by nature, which the impression that is to be accepted must have?'

And to conclude, the methods which are applied to the body by those who exercise it, may themselves conduce to training, if they tend in this direction, that is, if they bear upon the will to get and the will to avoid. But if their object is display, they are the marks of one who has swerved from the right line, whose aims are alien, one who is looking for spectators to say, 'What a great man!' This is why Apollonius was right in saying, 'If you wish to train for your soul's sake, when you are thirsty in hot weather take a mouthful of cold water and spit it out and tell no one!'

Seneca, in *Letters from a Stoic*, quotes Virgil, Horace (I'm unsure if Seneca quoted Horace but Montaigne did, in *On Solitude*) and Epicurus (although Epicureanism may be seen as ""the main opponent of Stoicism"", what Seneca quotes of Epicurus seems very much in line with Stoicism) often, so the literature of those authors may have Stoic undertones.

Apart from the above, /r/Stoicism, have you literature like it to recommend? All contributions are appreciated. Thanks in advance!",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_1cyjyh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1cyjyh/literature_with_stoic_undertones/,

Here's the Robin Hard (Wordsworth Classics) translation:

&gt;To the preceding principles, one more should be added; always define or describe whatever presents itself to your mind, so as to see what sort of thing it is when stripped to its essence, as a whole and in its separate parts; and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the elements from which it was compounded and into which it will finally be resolved.  For nothing is so conducive to elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truthfully everything that presents itself in life, and always to view things in such a way as to take account at the same time of what use each thing serves in what kind of a universe, and what value it has in relation to the whole, and what value to man as a citizen of the most exalted of cities, of which all other cities are, as it were, mere households; and what this object which now produces an impression in my mind actually is, and what it is composed of, and how long it will naturally endure; and *what virtue is needed to confront it, such as gentleness, courage, sincerity, fidelity, simplicity, self-sufficiency, and the rest.*  

&gt;So as each case presents itself one must say: this has come from god; this is allotted to me by the spinning and interweaving of the threads of destiny and suchlike coincidence or chance; this comes to me from one of my own kind, my relative, my friend, who yet has no knowledge of what truly accords with his nature.  But I am not ignorant of it, and thus I will treat him kindly and justly, as the natural law of fellowship requires. aiming at the same time, however, to assign to him what he deserves in the case of things that are neither good nor bad in themselves.

To me this passage encapsulates the idea of how I can conceptualize the obstacle becoming the way.  First I recognize the obstacle's impression on me, then I suspend my automatic conventional judgement and look from a vantage point outside of my own life and as objectively as possible.  Then I view the obstacle within the stoic framework as an opportunity for virtue, selecting the correct tool for the job at hand and go to work.  All this time, I keep in mind the relative unimportance of everything save my reaction to the obstacle, whether this is conceptualized as my fate or otherwise as something outside of my control and, therefore, not important to my flourishing.

Today I received some unexpected bad news about a project.  My immediate reaction was that it was bad and I didn't want to face the consequences.  I suspended that judgement, gave myself perspective that in the grand scheme of the Universe it is nothing, and my reaction is everything.

Married nine years and we have a seven year old son.  I started studying stoicism about three years ago.  We had typical problems before then.  Neither of us have cheated or been physically violent.

Stoicism has made me less emotional, but my wife wants an emotional connection.  I don't know how to explain an connection doesn't require that I be emotional.  I do try to express specific gratitude, ""Thank you for helping me out."" or ""Thank you for thinking of me.""  She wants love.  She wants to hear ""I love you.""  I don't know how to process love stoically.  Gratitude and love seem similar, only love is stickier - it can catch us and make us irrational.

We disagree on being vulnerable.  My wife believes you must be vulnerable to be in a relationship.  I think almost the opposite, I am most attracted to my wife when she is her strongest and most resilient.   I don't think we should divorce, but I try to convince myself that a divorce won't effect me emotionally.  I shouldn't have said that to her.

When we fight, I don't get emotional.  She does.  I don't want to be a wimp.  I rationally try to explain that she gets and much as she gives.  Most the time I feel like she is asking for more than a fair compromise.  My rational arguments are pointless, she gets mad at me for being up the past.

Am I practicing stoicism wrong?  Did I miss something?  Which of the stoics is most applicable to marriages?  How can I figure out if I am being an unjust husband or if she is unreasonable and I should stand my ground and let her decide to divorce or not?

You will not lose if you get a horse for an ass, an ox for a sheep, a noble action for a piece of money, true peace instead of pedantry, self-respect instead of foul language. If you remember this you will everywhere preserve your character as it ought to be: if you do not remember it, I warn you that your time perishes for nought, and you will waste and overthrow all the pains that you now spend upon yourself. It needs but a little to overthrow and destroy everything—just a slight aberration from reason. For the helmsman to wreck his vessel, he does not need the same resources, as he needs to save it: if he turn it but a little too far to the wind, he is lost; yes, and if he do it not deliberately but from mere want of attention, he is lost all the same. It is very much the same in life: if you doze but a little, all that you have amassed up till now leaves you. Keep awake then and watch your impressions: it is no trifle you have in keeping, but self-respect, honour, constancy, a quiet mind, untouched by distress, or fear, or agitation—in a word, freedom.

What are you going to sell all this for? Look and see what your purchase is worth.

'But I am not going to sell my freedom for anything of that kind.'

Well, suppose you waive external gain, consider what the exchange is that you are making. It is yours to say, 'Self-control for me, a tribunate for him: a praetorship for him, self-respect for me. I do not clamour, when to do so is unseemly, I will not jump from my seat, when I ought not, for I am free and God's friend, to obey Him of my own free will. I must not lay claim to anything else—body, property, office, reputation, anything in short, for He does not wish me to lay claim to them: had He wished it, He would have made them good for me, but He has not done so, and therefore I cannot transgress any of His commands.' In everything you do, guard what is your own good: for the rest, be content just to take anything that is given you, so far as you may use it rationally. Otherwise you will be wretched and miserable, hampered and hindered. These are the laws that are sent you from God, these are His ordinances. These you must expound, and these obey, not those of Masurius and Cassius.

So why do we have to supress them?,janshi,28,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/15a4yq/my_stoic_paradox_are_urgesdrives_natural_and_if/,"I have studied stoic literature for the last 3 weeks or so, critically examined all advices of living in theory and tried them out in everyday life. So far I have found it to be extremely concurrent with my own personal philosophy and I feel much better after following common suggestions by Epictetus (stoicism is part of my personal theraphy of depression but that's not the topic for now). 

I understand that Seneca has split stoic ethics into three groups:

1. **Things and their allocation**: value is part of our own imagination, not the things themself

2. **Drives/urges and desires**: have to be supressed or controlled

3. **Actions**: need to be in harmony with ones own natural drive (*impetus*) thus we have to act instinctively

The thing I don't get is in the title: If we have to act in harmony with our own natural drives and fight every unnatural behavior why are drives/urges so condemned by stoics?

Practical example: If my drive tells me to eat a lot of chocolate isn't it totally natural and instinctively right to do it (though unreasonable)?
On the other hand I don't have to think about certain reasonable behavior e.g. I let other people have their opinions without getting personally. This I have learned in a process of reason during my life and do it instinctively now. 

How can I find the difference between instinctive behavior that comes from urges and instinctive behavior that comes from reason?

&gt;""Look how many people are just acting without thinking for their whole life and are happy with it."" 

Is it possible that some people have simply learned to act virtuously during their life e.g. by following their parents rules until it became their instinct but never reflected on their behavior? I such behavior good?

Why do *we* have to learn this so tediously slowly by examining all our actions with reason until we have learned to act reasonable by instinct and become happy from virtue? [we are in our early twenties]

Interestingly in modern psychology drive theory is largly deprecated. Instead *learned behavior* (Habituation) is the term used nowadays meaning every drive is learned from our environment.

One of my stoic book tells that ancient stoic ethic believes that from all the indifferent things in the world some things mean value to us by nature (from birth on) because they allow us to be ourselfes, love ourselfes and sustain oursselfes. This basic need grows during our lifetime into much bigger needs (here the German book uses the word for urge/drive): drive for food, drive for knowledge, drive for sex, social drive. Sounds a lot like modern CBT, he? 

Does this mean that I have learned these drives during my life (= they are not natural) so learning to live without them means going back to nature?

Excuse my poor use of words and lack of source citations. I am studying stoic philosophy mainly with German books that use latin terms and I am very unsure of how to translate these words into modern English. I have already ordered **The Philosophy of CBT** - hope this will help me better participate in /Stoicism but maybe German-speaking people can help me translate these words:

* Trieb = Drive / urge?

* Begierden = Desires?

* Zuteilung (von Gütern) = allocation / assignment?

* Vernunft = prudence / reason?

* Tugend = virtue / goodness?",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,1356188941.0,,,True,t3_15a4yq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/15a4yq/my_stoic_paradox_are_urgesdrives_natural_and_if/,

Do you still desire what your nurse, your guardian, or your mother, have prayed for in your behalf? Do you not yet understand what evil they prayed for? Alas, how hostile to us are the wishes of our own folk! And they are all the more hostile in proportion as they are more completely fulfilled. It is no surprise to me, at my age, that nothing but evil attends us from our early youth; for we have grown up amid the curses invoked by our parents. And may the gods give ear to our cry also, uttered in our own behalf, – one which asks no favours!

2 How long shall we go on making demands upon the gods, as if we were still unable to support ourselves? How long shall we continue to fill with grain the market-places of our great cities? How long must the people gather it in for us? How long shall many ships convey the requisites for a single meal, bringing them from no single sea? The bull is filled when he feeds over a few acres; and one forest is large enough for a herd of elephants. Man, however, draws sustenance both from the earth and from the sea. 

3 What, then? Did nature give us bellies so insatiable, when she gave us these puny bodies, that we should outdo the hugest and most voracious animals in greed? Not at all. How small is the amount which will satisfy nature? A very little will send her away contented. It is not the natural hunger of our bellies that costs us dear, but our solicitous cravings. 

4 Therefore those who, as Sallust**[1]** puts it, ""hearken to their bellies,"" should be numbered among the animals, and not among men; and certain men, indeed, should be numbered, not even among the animals, but among the dead. He really lives who is made use of by many; he really lives who makes use of himself. Those men, however, who creep into a hole and grow torpid**[2]** are no better off in their homes than if they were in their tombs. Right there on the marble lintel of the house of such a man you may inscribe his name,**[3]** for he has died before he is dead. Farewell.

Now, lo and behold, Campania, and especially Naples and your beloved Pompeii,**[1]** struck me, when I viewed them, with a wonderfully fresh sense of longing for you. You stand in full view before my eyes. I am on the point of parting from you. I see you choking down your tears and resisting without success the emotions that well up at the very moment when you try to check them. I seem to have lost you but a moment ago. For what is not ""but a moment ago"" when one begins to use the memory? 2. It was but a moment ago that I sat, as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion,**[2]** but a moment ago that I began to plead in the courts, but a moment ago that I lost the desire to plead, but a moment ago that I lost the ability. Infinitely swift is the flight of time, as those see more clearly who are looking backwards. For when we are intent on the present, we do not notice it, so gentle is the passage of time's headlong flight. 3. Do you ask the reason for this? All past time is in the same place; it all presents the same aspect to us, it lies together. Everything slips into the same abyss. Besides, an event which in its entirety is of brief compass cannot contain long intervals. The time which we spend in living is but a point, nay, even less than a point. But this point of time, infinitesimal as it is, nature has mocked by making it seem outwardly of longer duration; she has taken one portion thereof and made it infancy, another childhood, another youth, another the gradual slope, so to speak, from youth to old age, and old age itself is still another. How many steps for how short a climb! 4. It was but a moment ago that I saw you off on your journey; and yet this ""moment ago"" makes up a goodly share of our existence, which is so brief, we should reflect, that it will soon come to an end altogether. In other years time did not seem to me to go so swiftly; now, it seems fast beyond belief, perhaps, because I feel that the finish-line is moving closer to me, or it may be that I have begun to take heed and reckon up my losses.

5 For this reason I am all the more angry that some men claim the major portion of this time for superfluous things, – time which, no matter how carefully it is guarded, cannot suffice even for necessary things. Cicero**[3]** declared that if the number of his days were doubled, he should not have time to read the lyric poets.**[4]** And you may rate the dialecticians in the same class; but they are foolish in a more melancholy way. The lyric poets are avowedly frivolous; but the dialecticians believe that they are themselves engaged upon serious business. 6. I do not deny that one must cast a glance at dialectic; but it ought to be a mere glance, a sort of greeting from the threshold, merely that one may not be deceived, or judge these pursuits to contain any hidden matters of great worth.

Why do you torment yourself and lose weight over some problem which it is more clever to have scorned than to solve? When a soldier is undisturbed and travelling at his ease, he can hunt for trifles along his way; but when the enemy is closing in on the rear, and a command is given to quicken the pace, necessity makes him throw away everything which he picked up in moments of peace and leisure. 7. I have no time to investigate disputed inflections of words, or to try my cunning upon them.


*Behold the gathering clans, the fast-shut gates*,

*And weapons whetted ready for the war*.**[5]**


I need a stout heart to hear without flinching this din of battle which sounds round about. 8. And all would rightly think me mad if, when graybeards and women were heaping up rocks for the fortifications, when the armour-clad youths inside the gates were awaiting, or even demanding, the order for a sally, when the spears of the foemen were quivering in our gates and the very ground was rocking with mines and subterranean passages, – I say, they would rightly think me mad if I were to sit idle, putting such petty posers as this: ""What you have not lost, you have. But you have not lost any horns. Therefore, you have horns,""**[6]** or other tricks constructed after the model of this piece of sheer silliness. 9. And yet I may well seem in your eyes no less mad, if I spend my energies on that sort of thing; for even now I am in a state of siege. And yet, in the former case it would be merely a peril from the outside that threatened me, and a wall that sundered me from the foe; as it is now, death-dealing perils are in my very presence. I have no time for such nonsense; a mighty undertaking is on my hands. What am I to do? Death is on my trail, and life is fleeting away; 10. teach me something with which to face these troubles. Bring it to pass that I shall cease trying to escape from death, and that life may cease to escape from me. Give me courage to meet hardships; make me calm in the face of the unavoidable. Relax the straitened limits of the time which is allotted me. Show me that the good in life does not depend upon life's length, but upon the use we make of it; also, that it is possible, or rather usual, for a man who has lived long to have lived too little. Say to me when I lie down to sleep: ""You may not wake again!"" And when I have waked: ""You may not go to sleep again!"" Say to me when I go forth from my house: ""You may not return!"" And when I return: ""You may never go forth again!"" 11. You are mistaken if you think that only on an ocean voyage there is a very slight space**[7]** between life and death. No, the distance between is just as narrow everywhere. It is not everywhere that death shows himself so near at hand; yet everywhere he is as near at hand.

Rid me of these shadowy terrors; then you will more easily deliver to me the instruction for which I have prepared myself. At our birth nature made us teachable, and gave us reason, not perfect, but capable of being perfected. 12. Discuss for me justice, duty, thrift, and that twofold purity, both the purity which abstains from another's person, and that which takes care of one's own self. If you will only refuse to lead me along by-paths, I shall more easily reach the goal at which I am aiming. For, as the tragic poe**[8]** says:

*The language of truth is simple*.

We should not, therefore, make that language intricate; since there is nothing less fitting for a soul of great endeavour than such crafty cleverness. Farewell.

But the greatest benefit is to be derived from conversation, because it creeps by degrees into the soul. Lectures prepared beforehand and spouted in the presence of a throng have in them more noise but less intimacy. Philosophy is good advice; and no one can give advice at the top of his lungs. Of course we must sometimes also make use of these harangues, if I may so call them, when a doubting member needs to be spurred on; but when the aim is to make a man learn and not merely to make him wish to learn, we must have recourse to the low-toned words of conversation. They enter more easily, and stick in the memory; for we do not need many words, but, rather, effective words.

2 Words should be scattered like seed; no matter how small the seed may be, if it has once found favourable ground, it unfolds its strength and from an insignificant thing spreads to its greatest growth. Reason grows in the same way; it is not large to the outward view, but increases as it does its work. Few words are spoken; but if the mind has truly caught them, they come into their strength and spring up. Yes, precepts and seeds have the same quality; they produce much, and yet they are slight things. Only, as I said, let a favourable mind receive and assimilate them. Then of itself the mind also will produce bounteously in its turn, giving back more than it has received. Farewell.

But they already bear upon him so heavily that he cannot be raised up; old age has settled down upon him with great, – yes, with its entire, weight. You know that his body was always delicate and sapless. For a long time he has kept it in hand, or, to speak more correctly, has kept it together; of a sudden it has collapsed. 2. Just as in a ship that springs a leak, you can always stop the first or the second fissure, but when many holes begin to open and let in water, the gaping hull cannot be saved; similarly, in an old man's body, there is a certain limit up to which you can sustain and prop its weakness. But when it comes to resemble a decrepit building, when every joint begins to spread and while one is being repaired another falls apart, – then it is time for a man to look about him and consider how he may get out.**[1]**

3 But the mind of our friend Bassus is active. Philosophy bestows this boon upon us; it makes us joyful in the very sight of death, strong and brave no matter in what state the body may be, cheerful and never failing though the body fail us. A great pilot can sail even when his canvas is rent; if his ship be dismantled, he can yet put in trim what remains of her hull and hold her to her course. This is what our friend Bassus is doing; and he contemplates his own end with the courage and countenance which you would regard as undue indifference in a man who so contemplated another's.

4 This is a great accomplishment, Lucilius, and one which needs long practice to learn, – to depart calmly when the inevitable hour arrives. Other kinds of death contain an ingredient of hope: a disease comes to an end; a fire is quenched; falling houses have set down in safety those whom they seemed certain to crush; the sea has cast ashore unharmed those whom it had engulfed, by the same force through which it drew them down; the soldier has drawn back his sword from the very neck of his doomed foe. But those whom old age is leading away to death have nothing to hope for; old age alone grants no reprieve. No ending, to be sure, is more painless; but there is none more lingering.

5 Our friend Bassus seemed to me to be attending his own funeral, and laying out his own body for burial, and living almost as if he had survived his own death, and bearing with wise resignation his grief at his own departure. For he talks freely about death, trying hard to persuade us that if this process contains any element of discomfort or of fear, it is the fault of the dying person, and not of death itself; also, that there is no more inconvenience at the actual moment than there is after it is over. 6. ""And it is just as insane,"" he adds, ""for a man to fear what will not happen to him, as to fear what he will not feel if it does happen."" Or does anyone imagine it to be possible that the agency by which feeling is removed can be itself felt? ""Therefore,"" says Bassus, ""death stands so far beyond all evil that it is beyond all fear of evils.""

7 I know that all this has often been said and should be often repeated; but neither when I read them were such precepts so effective with me, nor when I heard them from the lips of those who were at a safe distance from the fear of the things which they declared were not to be feared. But this old man had the greatest weight with me when he discussed death and death was near. 8. For I must tell you what I myself think: I hold that one is braver at the very moment of death than when one is approaching death. For death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, who throughout the fight has been no matter how faint-hearted, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot.**[2]** But an end that is near at hand, and is bound to come, calls for tenacious courage of soul; this is a rarer thing, and none but the wise man can manifest it.

9 Accordingly, I listened to Bassus with the deepest pleasure; he was casting his vote concerning death and pointing out what sort of a thing it is when it is observed, so to speak, nearer at hand. I suppose that a man would have your confidence in a larger degree, and would have more weight with you, if he had come back to life and should declare from experience that there is no evil in death; and so, regarding the approach of death, those will tell you best what disquiet it brings who have stood in its path, who have seen it coming and have welcomed it. 10. Bassus may be included among these men; and he had no wish to deceive us. He says that it is as foolish to fear death as to fear old age; for death follows old age precisely as old age follows youth. He who does not wish to die cannot have wished to live. For life is granted to us with the reservation that we shall die; to this end our path leads. Therefore, how foolish it is to fear it, since men simply await that which is sure, but fear only that which is uncertain! 11. Death has its fixed rule, – equitable and unavoidable. Who can complain when he is governed by terms which include everyone? The chief part of equity, however, is equality.

But it is superfluous at the present time to plead Nature's cause; for she wishes our laws to be identical with her own; she but resolves that which she has compounded, and compounds again that which she has resolved. 12. Moreover, if it falls to the lot of any man to be set gently adrift by old age, – not suddenly torn from life, but withdrawn bit by bit, oh, verily he should thank the gods, one and all, because, after he has had his fill, he is removed to a rest which is ordained for mankind, a rest that is welcome to the weary. You may observe certain men who crave death even more earnestly than others are wont to beg for life. And I do not know which men give us greater courage, – those who call for death, or those who meet it cheerfully and tranquilly, – for the first attitude is sometimes inspired by madness and sudden anger, the second is the calm which results from fixed judgment. Before now men have gone to meet death in a fit of rage; but when death comes to meet him, no one welcomes it cheerfully, except the man who has long since composed himself for death.

13 I admit, therefore, that I have visited this dear friend of mine more frequently on many pretexts, but with the purpose of learning whether I should find him always the same, and whether his mental strength was perhaps waning in company with his bodily powers. But it was on the increase, just as the joy of the charioteer is wont to show itself more clearly when he is on the seventh round**[3]** of the course, and nears the prize. 14. Indeed, he often said, in accord with the counsels of Epicurus:**[4]** ""I hope, first of all, that there is no pain at the moment when a man breathes his last; but if there is, one will find an element of comfort in its very shortness. For no great pain lasts long. And at all events, a man will find relief at the very time when soul and body are being torn asunder, even though the process be accompanied by excruciating pain, in the thought that after this pain is over he can feel no more pain. I am sure, however, that an old man's soul is on his very lips, and that only a little force is necessary to disengage it from the body. A fire which has seized upon a substance that sustains it needs water to quench it, or, sometimes, the destruction of the building itself; but the fire which lacks sustaining fuel dies away of its own accord.""

15 I am glad to hear such words, my dear Lucilius, not as new to me, but as leading me into the presence of an actual fact. And what then? Have I not seen many men break the thread of life? I have indeed seen such men; but those have more weight with me who approach death without any loathing for life, letting death in, so to speak, and not pulling it towards them. 16. Bassus kept saying: ""It is due to our own fault that we feel this torture, because we shrink from dying only when we believe that our end is near at hand."" But who is not near death? It is ready for us in all places and at all times. ""Let us consider,"" he went on to say, ""when some agency of death seems imminent, how much nearer are other varieties of dying which are not feared by us."" 17. A man is threatened with death by an enemy, but this form of death is anticipated by an attack of indigestion. And if we are willing to examine critically the various causes of our fear, we shall find that some exist, and others only seem to be. We do not fear death; we fear the thought of death. For death itself is always the same distance from us; wherefore, if it is to be feared at all, it is to be feared always. For what season of our life is exempt from death?

18 But what I really ought to fear is that you will hate this long letter worse than death itself; so I shall stop. Do you, however, always think on death in order that you may never fear it. Farewell.

Are you surprised, as if it were a novelty, that after such long travel and so many changes of scene you have not been able to shake off the gloom and heaviness of your mind? You need a change of soul rather than a change of climate.**[1]** Though you may cross vast spaces of sea, and though, as our Vergil**[2]** remarks,
 


*Lands and cities are left astern*,
 


your faults will follow you whithersoever you travel. 2. Socrates made the same remark to one who complained; he said: ""Why do you wonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you always take yourself with you? The reason which set you wandering is ever at your heels."" What pleasure is there in seeing new lands? Or in surveying cities and spots of interest? All your bustle is useless. Do you ask why such flight does not help you? It is because you flee along with yourself. You must lay aside the burdens of the mind; until you do this, no place will satisfy you. 3. Reflect that your present behaviour is like that of the prophetess whom Vergil describes:**[3]** she is excited and goaded into fury, and contains within herself much inspiration that is not her own:
 



*The priestess raves, if haply she may shake*


*The great god from her heart*.
 


You wander hither and yon, to rid yourself of the burden that rests upon you, though it becomes more troublesome by reason of your very restlessness, just as in a ship the cargo when stationary makes no trouble, but when it shifts to this side or that, it causes the vessel to heel more quickly in the direction where it has settled. Anything you do tells against you, and you hurt yourself by your very unrest; for you are shaking up a sick man.
 
4 That trouble once removed, all change of scene will become pleasant; though you may be driven to the uttermost ends of the earth, in whatever corner of a savage land you may find yourself, that place, however forbidding, will be to you a hospitable abode. The person you are matters more than the place to which you go; for that reason we should not make the mind a bondsman to any one place. Live in this belief: ""I am not born for any one corner of the universe; this whole world is my country."" 5. If you saw this fact clearly, you would not be surprised at getting no benefit from the fresh scenes to which you roam each time through weariness of the old scenes. For the first would have pleased you in each case, had you believed it wholly yours.**[4]** As it is, however, you are not journeying; you are drifting and being driven, only exchanging one place for another, although that which you seek, – to live well, – is found everywhere.**[5]** 6. Can there be any spot so full of confusion as the Forum? Yet you can live quietly even there, if necessary. Of course, if one were allowed to make one's own arrangements, I should flee far from the very sight and neighbourhood of the Forum. For just as pestilential places assail even the strongest constitution, so there are some places which are also unwholesome for a healthy mind which is not yet quite sound, though recovering from its ailment. 7. I disagree with those who strike out into the midst of the billows and, welcoming a stormy existence, wrestle daily in hardihood of soul with life's problems. The wise man will endure all that, but will not choose it; he will prefer to be at peace rather than at war. It helps little to have cast out your own faults if you must quarrel with those of others. 8. Says one: ""There were thirty tyrants surrounding Socrates, and yet they could not break his spirit""; but what does it matter how many masters a man has? ""Slavery"" has no plural; and he who has scorned it is free, – no matter amid how large a mob of over-lords he stands.
 
9 It is time to stop, but not before I have paid duty. ""The knowledge of sin is the beginning of salvation."" This saying of Epicurus**[6]** seems to me to be a noble one. For he who does not know that he has sinned does not desire correction; you must discover yourself in the wrong before you can reform yourself. 10. Some boast of their faults. Do you think that the man has any thought of mending his ways who counts over his vices as if they were virtues? Therefore, as far as possible, prove yourself guilty, hunt up charges against yourself; play the part, first of accuser, then of judge, last of intercessor. At times be harsh with yourself.**[7]** Farewell.

1348073116.0,23,self.Stoicism,1055w7,David Foster Wallace's 2005 Commencement Speech,UncleCam,26,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1055w7/david_foster_wallaces_2005_commencement_speech/,"The speech can be read here: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178211966454607.html

I read this speech long before I knew what Stoicism even was. But as I learned more, through reading Marcus and Seneca, I kept coming back to the message that DFW puts forth in this speech. Whether he intended it or not, DFW's speech feels very Stoic to me (based on my understanding of what Stoicism is).

Wallace defines learning how to think as exercising control over how and what you think. You have to make the conscious effort to choose what you pay attention to and how your construct meaning from your observation and experience. You can choose to take a ""consumer-hell"" type situation, like a crowded grocery store filled with loud children and pushy parents, and instead of letting it make you miserable, you can choose to see the people around you as being the same as you, alive, looking for the same things you are. You can see yourself as a small part of the whole instead of the center of the universe, which is your default setting.

Another thing Wallace points out is that the object of your worship can enslave you. This reminds me of Seneca, warning us of the dangers of ""self-imposed slavery."" If you worship money, you will never have enough. If you worship beauty, you will always feel ugly. If you worship your own intellect, you will always feel stupid and afraid of other finding that you are not actually as smart as you want yourself to be. If external status symbols are where you tap into meaning, you will create a hole that is impossible to fill. 

The last major point I took from Wallace here was that true freedom comes from empathy. From stepping outside of your own ""skull-sized kingdom"" and recognizing that you make up an infinitesimally small part of the universe. It means that when you are boiling with rage at being stuck in traffic, you realize that you are the traffic. 


Anyway, here are some of my favorite quotes from the speech, which i read almost everyday.

""""Learning how to think"" really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.""


""There happen to be whole large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustrations""

""But if you've really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. It will be within your power to experience a crowded, loud, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars - compassion, love, the sub-surface unity of all things. Not that that mystical stuff's necessarily true: the only thing that's capital-T true is how you get to decide how you're going to see it.""


""If you worship money and things - if they are where you tap real meaning in life - then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. One on level, we know this stuff already - it's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power - you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart - you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.""


""And the world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the world of men and money and power hums along quite nicely on the fuel of fear and contempt and frustration and craving and the worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom to be lords of our own tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear talked about in the great outside world of winning and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being ale to truly care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom.""",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_1055w7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1055w7/david_foster_wallaces_2005_commencement_speech/,

And yet it is impossible in so short a time for one either to become good or be known as such.**[1]** Do you know what kind of man I now mean when I speak of ""a good man""? I mean one of the second grade, like your friend. For one of the first class perhaps springs into existence, like the phoenix, only once in five hundred years. And it is not surprising, either, that greatness develops only at long intervals; Fortune often brings into being commonplace powers, which are born to please the mob; but she holds up for our approval that which is extraordinary by the very fact that she makes it rare.

2 This man, however, of whom you spoke, is still far from the state which he professes to have reached. And if he knew what it meant to be ""a good man,"" he would not yet believe himself such; perhaps he would even despair of his ability to become good. ""But,"" you say, ""he thinks ill of evil men."" Well, so do evil men themselves; and there is no worse penalty for vice than the fact that it is dissatisfied with itself and all its fellows. 3. ""But he hates those who make an ungoverned use of great power suddenly acquired."" I retort that he will do the same thing as soon as he acquires the same powers. In the case of many men, their vices, being powerless, escape notice; although, as soon as the persons in question have become satisfied with their own strength, the vices will be no less daring than those which prosperity has already disclosed. 4. These men simply lack the means whereby they may unfold their wickedness. Similarly, one can handle even a poisonous snake while it is stiff with cold; the poison is not lacking; it is merely numbed into inaction. In the case of many men, their cruelty, ambition, and indulgence only lack the favour of Fortune to make them dare crimes that would match the worst. That their wishes are the same you will in a moment discover, in this way: give them the power equal to their wishes.

5 Do you remember how, when you declared that a certain person was under your influence, I pronounced him fickle and a bird of passage, and said that you held him not by the foot but merely by a wing? Was I mistaken? You grasped him only by a feather; he left it in your hands and escaped. You know what an exhibition he afterwards made of himself before you, how many of the things he attempted were to recoil upon his own head. He did not see that in endangering others he was tottering to his own downfall. He did not reflect how burdensome were the objects which he was bent upon attaining, even if they were not superfluous.

6 Therefore, with regard to the objects which we pursue, and for which we strive with great effort, we should note this truth; either there is nothing desirable in them, or the undesirable is preponderant. Some objects are superfluous; others are not worth the price we pay for them. But we do not see this clearly, and we regard things as free gifts when they really cost us very dear. 7. Our stupidity may be clearly proved by the fact that we hold that ""buying"" refers only to the objects for which we pay cash, and we regard as free gifts the things for which we spend our very selves. These we should refuse to buy, if we were compelled to give in payment for them our houses or some attractive and profitable estate; but we are eager to attain them at the cost of anxiety, of danger, and of lost honour, personal freedom, and time; so true it is that each man regards nothing as cheaper than himself.

8 Let us therefore act, in all our plans and conduct, just as we are accustomed to act whenever we approach a huckster who has certain wares for sale; let us see how much we must pay for that which we crave. Very often the things that cost nothing cost us the most heavily; I can show you many objects the quest and acquisition of which have wrested freedom from our hands. We should belong to ourselves, if only these things did not belong to us.

9 I would therefore have you reflect thus, not only when it is a question of gain, but also when it is a question of loss. ""This object is bound to perish."" Yes, it was a mere extra; you will live without it just as easily as you have lived before. If you have possessed it for a long time, you lose it after you have had your fill of it; if you have not possessed it long, then you lose it before you have become wedded to it. ""You will have less money."" Yes, and less trouble. 10. ""Less influence."" Yes, and less envy. Look about you and note the things that drive us mad, which we lose with a flood of tears; you will perceive that it is not the loss that troubles us with reference to these things, but a notion of loss. No one feels that they have been lost, but his mind tells him that it has been so. He that owns himself has lost nothing. But how few men are blessed with ownership of self! Farewell.

And this way will be afforded you by philosophy. Betake yourself therefore to philosophy if you would be safe, untroubled, happy, in fine, if you wish to be, – and that is most important, – free. There is no other way to attain this end. 4. Folly**[4]** is low, abject, mean, slavish, and exposed to many of the cruellest passions. These passions, which are heavy taskmasters, sometimes ruling by turns, and sometimes together, can be banished from you by wisdom, which is the only real freedom. There is but one path leading thither, and it is a straight path; you will not go astray. Proceed with steady step, and if you would have all things under your control, put yourself under the control of reason; if reason becomes your ruler, you will become ruler over many. You will learn from her what you should undertake, and how it should be done; you will not blunder into things. 5. You can show me no man who knows how he began to crave that which he craves. He has not been led to that pass by forethought; he has been driven to it by impulse. Fortune attacks us as often as we attack Fortune. It is disgraceful, instead of proceeding ahead, to be carried along, and then suddenly, amid the whirlpool of events, to ask in a dazed way: ""How did I get into this condition?"" Farewell.

1360907294.0,21,self.Stoicism,18kfv7,Stoicism and Postmodernism: How I learned to stop worrying and break free of my depression,KillTheSage,25,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/18kfv7/stoicism_and_postmodernism_how_i_learned_to_stop/,"**Background:**

For the last couple of months, I've been struggling with depression. I turned to Stoicism for a solution, but I couldn't find one. Not until now at least.

Having such a negative self-image, I would feed on the attention of others just to be able to feel good about myself. In my various relationships in the past, this has caused problems. I was like someone who was always thirsty but couldn't get enough to drink. I thought a relationship that progressed traditionally would somehow fix me through magic and I'd feel like a happy person again.

In short, I was attached like a chain to the [relationship escalator](http://theblackleatherbelt.com/the-relationship-escalator). I had the expectation, that by going up it, I'd find true happiness and all my dreams would come true(That's hyperbole but you get the point.) Our society expects us to be on the relationship escalator. If we're not, they think something's wrong with us. They think, that by not following this cultural narrative, we fail as a person.

That's the key : Cultural Narratives aren't necessarily a good thing. They internalize a number of values and expectations in us that color how we see the world. More importantly, they lead us to give attachment to certain values, that when not met, disturb our tranquility.

**Writing Exercise:**

Examine the cultural narratives that have fed to all of you your whole life.

* What has it made you value and what has it made you do?
* How much attachment do you have to those values, and when they're not met, have you been disturbed by passion and to what extent?
* Re-examine and analyze your values

If these cultural narratives are undermining your attempts to gain an inner serenity, then you should probably have a good long think about what you value and how much attachment you have to that value.

Having a value isn't a bad thing, what is bad is when your attachment to that value disturbs your tranquility. Be glad on the days when the world corresponds to your values, they're a gift the universe has gifted to you. Realize though the universe doesn't care about what you value, there will be times when everything will feel so wrong. The universe doesn't care that you feel slighted. It just keeps going without a care.

With this in mind, don't be afraid to have values, to impose meaning on your life. That's a good thing! Just realize the universe will gift you some days with your self-imposed meaning while other days, it will give what you believe in the finger.

Anyway, with that all out of the way:

1356970380.0,20,self.Stoicism,15q7fy,How We Must Struggle Against Impressions - Discourses of Epictetus,ThatsOK,22,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/15q7fy/how_we_must_struggle_against_impressions/,"Every habit and every faculty is confirmed and strengthened by the corresponding acts, the faculty of walking by walking, that of running by running. If you wish to have a faculty for reading, read; if for writing, write. When you have not read for thirty days on end, but have done something else, you will know what happens. So if you lie in bed for ten days, and then get up and try to take a fairly long walk, you will see how your legs lose their power. So generally if you wish to acquire a habit for anything, do the thing; if you do not wish to acquire the habit, abstain from doing it, and acquire the habit of doing something else instead. The same holds good in things of the mind: when you are angry; know that you have not merely done ill, but that you have strengthened the habit, and, as it were, put fuel on the fire. When you yield to carnal passion you must take account not only of this one defeat, but of the fact that you have fed your incontinence and strengthened it. For habits and faculties are bound to be affected by the corresponding actions; they are either implanted if they did not exist before, or strengthened and intensified if they were there already. This is exactly how philosophers say that morbid habits spring up in the mind. For when once you conceive a desire for money, if reason is applied to make you realize the evil, the desire is checked and the Governing



Principle recovers its first power; but if you give it no medicine to heal it, it will not return to where it was, but when stimulated again by the appropriate impression it kindles to desire quicker than before. And if this happens time after time it ends by growing hardened, and the weakness confirms the avarice in a man. For he who has a fever and gets quit of it is not in the same condition as before he had it, unless he has undergone a complete cure. The same sort of thing happens with affections of the mind. They leave traces behind them like weals from a blow, and if a man does not succeed in removing them, when he is flogged again on the same place his weals turn into sores. If, then, you wish not to be choleric, do not feed the angry habit, do not add fuel to the fire. To begin with, keep quiet, and count the days when you were not angry. I used to be angry every day, then every other day, then every three days, then every four. But if you miss thirty days, then sacrifice to God: for the habit is first weakened and then wholly destroyed.

I kept free from distress to-day, and again next day, and for two or three months after; and when occasions arose to provoke it, I took pains to check it.

Know that you are doing well.

To-day when I saw a handsome woman I did not say to myself, 'Would that she were mine!' and 'Blessed is her husband!' For he who says that will say, 'Blessed is the adulterer!' Nor do I picture the next scene: the woman present and disrobing and reclining by my side. I pat myself on the head and say, 'Bravo, Epictetus, you have refuted a pretty fallacy, a much prettier one than the so-called ""Master""'. 2-9 And if, though the woman herself, poor thing, is willing and beckons and sends to me, and even touches me and comes close to me, I still hold aloof and conquer: the refutation of this fallacy is something greater than the argument of 'The Liar', or the 'Resting' argument. This is a thing to be really proud of, rather than of propounding the 'Master' argument.

How, then, is this to be done? Make up your mind at last to please your true self, make up your mind to appear noble to God; set your desires on becoming pure in the presence of your pure self and God. 'Then when an impression of that sort assails you', says Plato [Laws, 854b], 'go and offer expiatory sacrifices, go as a suppliant and sacrifice to the gods who avert evil': it is enough even if 'you withdraw to the society of the good and noble' and set yourself to compare them with yourself, whether your pattern be among the living or the dead. Go to Socrates and see him reclining with Alcibiades and making light of his beauty. Consider what a victory, what an Olympic triumph, he won over himself—and knew it—what place he thus achieved among the


followers of Heracles! a victory that deserves the salutation, 'Hail, admirable victor, who hast conquered something more than these worn-out boxers and pancratiasts and the gladiators who are like them!' If you set these thoughts against your impression, you will conquer it, and not be carried away by it. But first of all do not be hurried away by the suddenness of the shock, but say, 'Wait for me a little, impression. Let me see what you are, and what is at stake: let me test you'. And, further, do not allow it to go on picturing the next scene. If you do, it straightway carries you off whither it will. Cast out this filthy impression and bring in some other impression, a lovely and noble one, in its place. I say, if you acquire the habit of training yourself thus, you will see what shoulders you get, what sinews, what vigour; but now you have only paltry words and nothing more.

The man who truly trains is he who disciplines himself to face such impressions. Stay, unhappy man! be not carried away. Great is the struggle, divine the task; the stake is a kingdom, freedom, peace, an unruffled spirit. Remember God, call Him to aid and support you, as voyagers call in storm to the Dioscuri. Can any storm be greater than that which springs from violent impressions that drive out reason? For what is storm itself but an impression? Take away the fear of death, and you may bring as much thunder and lightning as you will, and you will discover what deep peace and tranquillity is in your mind. But if you once allow yourself to be defeated and say that you will conquer hereafter, and then do the same again, be sure that you will be weak and miserable; you will never notice hereafter that you are going wrong, but will even begin to provide excuses for your conduct: and then you will confirm the truth of Hesiod's words, '*A dilatory man is ever wrestling with calamities*'. [Works and Days, 413]

1349091353.0,21,self.Stoicism,10r8n6,"Let's learn from each other, how do you ""use"" Stoicism in daily life? (idea stolen from r/buddhism)",MrGhkl444,24,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/10r8n6/lets_learn_from_each_other_how_do_you_use/,"Hi /r/stoicism , i thought it would be a good idea to pool ideas and see if any ""tweaks"" in your own practice could help or enlighten others.

Personally i try to keep things as concise as possible so that i can bring it to mind multiple times throughout the day. 

I keep it to 3 concepts for the most part

1. ""Nothing can trouble you but your own imagination"" - this is actually a quote by Nisargadatta Maharaj (http://www.amazon.com/I-Am-That-Nisargadatta-Maharaj/dp/0893860468/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349089584&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i+am+that+-+by+nisargatta+maharaj) though i feel it's effectively the same concept brought forward by Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. Basically recognising that everything that you'll ever experience is just an arising in your mind and you can choose your relationship with this. 

2. ""What you crave is what will destroy you"" - this is actually a pretty new one for me which really felt like this missing piece. Mostly inspired by this talk by David Foster Wallace (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vET9cvlGJQw) but it all fits with the Buddhist idea that desire is the root of suffering. I realised i was ""doing"" Stoicism as a way of trying to create some sort of psychological long term security which is of course impossible. In the craving for security i just felt more and more insecure which in turn made me grasp harder and harder. I know it's a cliche but i guess this is ""letting go""

3. ""The Universe has loaned me this life and i intend to pay it back with interest"" - I heard this on a documentary called ""happy"". I guess it's not truly Stoic in a sense and is more along the lines of Buddhism . I am great believer that true contentment is from the dissolution of the sense of self, either from mindfulness meditation, compassion for others, religion (""to give oneself to god"") , flow etc. I think, and have found from personal experience, that if you wake up everyday with the primary goal of making yourself happy then you will forever be unhappy, this fits with number 2 too i guess .

Another quote i really like, from Discourses and Selected Writings by Epictetus (obviously i don't try and remember this whole thing though!)

""So don't go up against God by hoping for what is unattainable, namely to keep for ever what doesn't really belong to you. Keep them in the spirit they were given, for as long as possible. If he gives he also takes away. So why try and resist him? It would be stupid to oppose one who is stronger than I, but more importantly it would be wrong. For how did i come by these belongings in the first place? From my father - who got them from his. Who created the sun, though, the fruits of the earth, and the seasons? who engineered mankind's mutual attraction, and the social order?

When everythign you have has been given to you, including your very existence, your proceed to turn on your benefactor and fault him for taking things bacl. Who are you, and how did you get here? it was God brought you into the world, who showed you the light, gave you the people who support you, gave you reason and perception. And he brought you into the world as a mortal, to pass your time on earth with a little endowment of flesh, to witness his design and share for a short time in his feast and celebration. So why not enjoy the feast and pageant while it's given you to do so; then, when he ushers you out, go with thanks and reverence for what you were privileged for a time to see and hear.""

Phew, sorry, this came off a bit longer than i intended.

Apparently the phrase was in a 50's political movie and a few other obscure places, though I don't think I heard it from any of those sources.  I find that it restates ""Virtue is the only good"" in an important way, since Utilitarianism, Machiavelli, etc developed post-Hellenistic philosophy.

So here is how I tie this to Epictetus.  #24 from the Handbook:

&gt; Don't allow considerations such as these to distress you. ""I will live in dishonor, and be nobody anywhere."" For, if dishonor is an evil, you can no more be involved in any evil by the means of another, than be engaged in anything base. Is it any business of yours, then, to get power, or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How, then, after all, is this a dishonor? And how is it true that you will be nobody anywhere, when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are in your own control, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? 

&gt; ""But my friends will be unassisted."" -- 

&gt; What do you mean by unassisted? 

&gt; ""They will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens.""

&gt; Who told you, then, that these are among the things in our own control, and not the affair of others? And who can give to another the things which he has not himself? 

&gt; ""Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a share."" 

&gt; **If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and greatness of mind, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require me to lose my own proper good that you may gain what is not good, consider how inequitable and foolish you are.** Besides, which would you rather have, a sum of money, or a friend of fidelity and honor? Rather assist me, then, to gain this character than require me to do those things by which I may lose it. 

&gt; ""Well, but my country, as far as depends on me, will be unassisted."" 

&gt; Here again, what assistance is this you mean? 

&gt; ""It will not have porticoes nor baths of your providing."" 

&gt; And what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with shoes, or a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if everyone fully performs his own proper business. And were you to supply it with another citizen of honor and fidelity, would not he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to it. 

&gt; ""What place, then, will I hold in the state?"" 

&gt; **Whatever you can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor.

You might complain if I said ""yesterday"" merely. This is why I have added ""with us."" For, so far as I am concerned, you are always with me. Certain friends had happened in, on whose account a somewhat brighter fire was laid, – not the kind that generally bursts from the kitchen chimneys of the rich and scares the watch, but the moderate blaze which means that guests have come. 

2 Our talk ran on various themes, as is natural at a dinner; it pursued no chain of thought to the end, but jumped from one topic to another. We then had read to us a book by Quintus Sextius the Elder.**[1]** He is a great man, if you have any confidence in my opinion, and a real Stoic, though he himself denies it. 

3 Ye Gods, what strength and spirit one finds in him! This is not the case with all philosophers; there are some men of illustrious name whose writings are sapless. They lay down rules, they argue, and they quibble; they do not infuse spirit simply because they have no spirit. But when you come to read Sextius you will say: ""He is alive; he is strong; he is free; he is more than a man; he fills me with a mighty confidence before I close his book."" 

4 I shall acknowledge to you the state of mind I am in when I read his works: I want to challenge every hazard; I want to cry: ""Why keep me waiting, Fortune? Enter the lists! Behold, I am ready for you!"" I assume the spirit of a man who seeks where he may make trial of himself where he may show his worth:

*And fretting 'mid the unwarlike flocks he prays*

*Some foam-flecked boar may cross his path, or else*

*A tawny lion stalking down the hills*. **[2]**

5 I want something to overcome, something on which I may test my endurance. For this is another remarkable quality that Sextius possesses: he will show you the grandeur of the happy life and yet will not make you despair of attaining it; you will understand that it is on high, but that it is accessible to him who has the will to seek it.

6 And virtue herself will have the same effect upon you, of making you admire her and yet hope to attain her. In my own case, at any rate the very contemplation of wisdom takes much of my time; I gaze upon her with bewilderment, just as I sometimes gaze upon the firmament itself, which I often behold as if I saw it for the first time. 

7 Hence I worship the discoveries of wisdom and their discoverers; to enter, as it were, into the inheritance of many predecessors is a delight. It was for me that they laid up this treasure; it was for me that they toiled. But we should play the part of a careful householder; we should increase what we have inherited. This inheritance shall pass from me to my descendants larger than before. Much still remains to do, and much will always remain, and he who shall be born a thousand ages hence will not be barred from his opportunity of adding something further. 

8 But even if the old masters have discovered everything, one thing will be always new, – the application and the scientific study and classification of the discoveries made by others. Assume that prescriptions have been handed down to us for the healing of the eyes; there is no need of my searching for others in addition; but for all that, these prescriptions must be adapted to the particular disease and to the particular stage of the disease. Use this prescription to relieve granulation of the eyelids, that to reduce the swelling of the lids, this to prevent sudden pain or a rush of tears, that to sharpen the vision. Then compound these several prescriptions, watch for the right time of their application, and supply the proper treatment in each case.

The cures for the spirit also have been discovered by the ancients; but it is our task to learn the method and the time of treatment. 

9 Our predecessors have worked much improvement, but have not worked out the problem. They deserve respect, however, and should be worshipped with a divine ritual. Why should I not keep statues of great men to kindle my enthusiasm, and celebrate their birthdays? Why should I not continually greet them with respect and honour? The reverence which I owe to my own teachers I owe in like measure to those teachers of the human race, the source from which the beginnings of such great blessings have flowed. 

10 If I meet a consul or a praetor, I shall pay him all the honour which his post of honour is wont to receive: I shall dismount, uncover, and yield the road. What, then? Shall I admit into my soul with less than the highest marks of respect Marcus Cato, the Elder and the Younger, Laelius the Wise, Socrates and Plato, Zeno and Cleanthes? I worship them in very truth, and always rise to do honour to such noble names. Farewell.

1371474688.0,19,self.Stoicism,1gihkc,Two elements of Stoicism that I still fail to fully grasp and would appreciate thoughts.,augustusthered,22,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1gihkc/two_elements_of_stoicism_that_i_still_fail_to/,"I consider myself a fledgling-Stoic.  I have read around the subject quite a bit, and it strongly resonates with me in almost all areas.  But there are two elements of the philosophy that I can't get fully straight in my mind, and on which I would appreciate people's thoughts:

1) Negative visualisation as a pre-defence - I totally understand the need to value what we have rather than threatening our tranquility by striving for things the aquisition of which lies outside of our control.  And I entirely see that negative visualisation can be an effective tool in reminding us of the value of the things and people around us.  But the idea that it can somehow armour us for the real occurence of such loss seems flawed to me (and I'm taking really about the loss of loved ones here, not material posessions - that's easy).  I get so upset by my visualistion of the loss of loved ones that I'm essentially forcing myself into feelings of grief every night - my tranquility during these times is shot to pieces.  Can this really be the intention or have I missed the point?

2) Personal life objectives  - how do other people reconcile the desire (and value) of setting goals for their lives?  If I understand correctly, a sound Stoic goal is one that is internalised in nature (i.e. sits as far as possible within one's own control), but the very act of personal goal-setting seems in some ways anti-stoic.  But a life without goals seems passive and uncontrolled - whch I also consider anti-Stoic. What does everyone else do on this one?

The labels don't matter that much to me, I just want to be sure I understand him.  To me, *Antifragile* is a reframing (or at least rephrasing) of stoic philosophies.

* Taleb describes the underlying mechanics of the world as nonlinear.  To be antifragile means that at the extremes, the negative effects get smaller and the positive effects get larger.  Taleb implies that the goal of stoic exercises is to make yourself emotional antifragile - to minimize negative emotions, but remain open to positive emotions.  Do you agree that this is the purposes of stoic exercises?

*Stoicism teaches us to focus on what we can control and ignore what we can not control (general).  More specifically, Taleb recommends that if we make our lives antifragile (benefiting from randomness) we are no longer bothered by what we can not control.  Is someone accepts what they can't control because they know they will benefit in the long term truly stoic?

*One part of stoicism I have struggled with is defining what it means to live in accordance with nature.  Taleb emphasizes the benefit of evolutionary forces - good and bad are replaced by survival and extinction.  To capture the power of evolutionary forces we should expose ourselves stress and never try to shield ourselves from stressors.  As a result, we should favor the ancient over the modern.  Does living in accordance with nature mean seeking evolutionary stresses or is it bigger and broader than that?",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_14g6o9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/14g6o9/how_does_well_does_nicholas_nassim_talebs/,
1353619959.0,19,self.Stoicism,13mykp,"On groundless fears - Seneca, Letter 13",ThatsOK,21,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/13mykp/on_groundless_fears_seneca_letter_13/,"1 I know that you have plenty of spirit; for even before you began to equip yourself with maxims which were wholesome and potent to overcome obstacles, you were taking pride in your contest with Fortune; and this is all the more true, now that you have grappled with Fortune and tested your powers. For our powers can never inspire in us implicit faith in ourselves except when many difficulties have confronted us on this side and on that, and have occasionally even come to close quarters with us. It is only in this way that the true spirit can be tested, - the spirit that will never consent to come under the jurisdiction of things external to ourselves. 2. This is the touchstone of such a spirit; no prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth rattle beneath his opponent's fist, who has been tripped and felt the full force of his adversary's charge, who has been downed in body but not in spirit, one who, as often as he falls, rises again with greater defiance than ever. 3. So then, to keep up my figure, Fortune has often in the past got the upper hand of you, and yet you have not surrendered, but have leaped up and stood your ground still more eagerly. For manliness gains much strength by being challenged; nevertheless, if you approve, allow me to offer some additional safeguards by which you may fortify yourself.

4 There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality. I am not speaking with you in the Stoic strain but in my milder style. For it is our Stoic fashion to speak of all those things, which provoke cries and groans, as unimportant and beneath notice; but you and I must drop such great-sounding words, although, heaven knows, they are true enough. What I advise you to do is, not to be unhappy before the crisis comes; since it may be that the dangers before which you paled as if they were threatening you, will never come upon you; they certainly have not yet come. 5. Accordingly, some things torment us more than they ought; some torment us before they ought; and some torment us when they ought not to torment us at all. We are in the habit of exaggerating, or imagining, or anticipating, sorrow.

The first of these three faults**[1]** may be postponed for the present, because the subject is under discussion and the case is still in court, so to speak. That which I should call trifling, you will maintain to be most serious; for of course I know that some men laugh while being flogged, and that others wince at a box on the ear. We shall consider later whether these evils derive their power from their own strength, or from our own weakness.

6 Do me the favour, when men surround you and try to talk you into believing that you are unhappy, to consider not what you hear but what you yourself feel, and to take counsel with your feelings and question yourself independently, because you know your own affairs better than anyone else does. Ask: ""Is there any reason why these persons should condole with me? Why should they be worried or even fear some infection from me, as if troubles could be transmitted? Is there any evil involved, or is it a matter merely of ill report, rather than an evil?"" Put the question voluntarily to yourself: ""Am I tormented without sufficient reason, am I morose, and do I convert what is not an evil into what is an evil?"" 7. You may retort with the question: ""How am I to know whether my sufferings are real or imaginary?"" Here is the rule for such matters: we are tormented either by things present, or by things to come, or by both. As to things present, the decision is easy. Suppose that your person enjoys freedom and health, and that you do not suffer from any external injury. As to what may happen to it in the future, we shall see later on. To-day there is nothing wrong with it. 8. ""But,"" you say, ""something will happen to it."" First of all, consider whether your proofs of future trouble are sure. For it is more often the case that we are troubled by our apprehensions, and that we are mocked by that mocker, rumour, which is wont to settle wars, but much more often settles individuals. Yes, my dear Lucilius; we agree too quickly with what people say. We do not put to the test those things which cause our fear; we do not examine into them; we blench and retreat just like soldiers who are forced to abandon their camp because of a dust-cloud raised by stampeding cattle, or are thrown into a panic by the spreading of some unauthenticated rumour. 9. And somehow or other it is the idle report that disturbs us most. For truth has its own definite boundaries, but that which arises from uncertainty is delivered over to guesswork and the irresponsible license of a frightened mind. That is why no fear is so ruinous and so uncontrollable as panic fear. For other fears are groundless, but this fear is witless.

10 Let us, then, look carefully into the matter. It is likely that some troubles will befall us; but it is not a present fact. How often has the unexpected happened! How often has the expected never come to pass! And even though it is ordained to be, what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering? You will suffer soon enough, when it arrives; so look forward meanwhile to better things. 11 What shall you gain by doing this? Time. There will be many happenings meanwhile which will serve to postpone, or end, or pass on to another person, the trials which are near or even in your very presence. A fire has opened the way to flight. Men have been let down softly by a catastrophe. Sometimes the sword has been checked even at the victim's throat. Men have survived their own executioners. Even bad fortune is fickle. Perhaps it will come, perhaps not; in the meantime it is not. So look forward to better things.

12 The mind at times fashions for itself false shapes of evil when there are no signs that point to any evil; it twists into the worst construction some word of doubtful meaning; or it fancies some personal grudge to be more serious than it really is, considering not how angry the enemy is, but to what lengths he may go if he is angry. But life is not worth living, and there is no limit to our sorrows, if we indulge our fears to the greatest possible extent; in this matter, let prudence help you, and contemn with a resolute spirit even when it is in plain sight. If you cannot do this, counter one weakness with another, and temper your fear with hope. There is nothing so certain among these objects of fear that it is not more certain still that things we dread sink into nothing and that things we hope for mock us.

13 Accordingly, weigh carefully your hopes as well as your fears, and whenever all the elements are in doubt, decide in your own favour; believe what you prefer. And if fear wins a majority of the votes, incline in the other direction anyhow, and cease to harass your soul, reflecting continually that most mortals, even when no troubles are actually at hand or are certainly to be expected in the future, become excited and disquieted. No one calls a halt on himself, when he begins to be urged ahead; nor does he regulate his alarm according to the truth. No one says; ""The author of the story is a fool, and he who has believed it is a fool, as well as he who fabricated it."" We let ourselves drift with every breeze; we are frightened at uncertainties, just as if they were certain. We observe no moderation. The slightest thing turns the scales and throws us forthwith into a panic.

14 But I am ashamed either to admonish you sternly or to try to beguile you with such mild remedies.**[2]** Let another say. ""Perhaps the worst will not happen."" You yourself must say. ""Well, what if it does happen? Let us see who wins! Perhaps it happens for my best interests; it may be that such a death will shed credit upon my life."" Socrates was ennobled by the hemlock draught. Wrench from Cato's hand his sword, the vindicator of liberty, and you deprive him of the greatest share of his glory. 15. I am exhorting you far too long, since you need reminding rather than exhortation. The path on which I am leading you is not different from that on which your nature leads you; you were born to such conduct as I describe. Hence there is all the more reason why you should increase and beautify the good that is in you.

16 But now, to close my letter, I have only to stamp the usual seal upon it, in other words, to commit thereto some noble message to be delivered to you: ""The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live.""**[3]** Reflect, my esteemed Lucilius, what this saying means, and you will see how revolting is the fickleness of men who lay down every day new foundations of life, and begin to build up fresh hopes even at the brink of the grave. 17. Look within your own mind for individual instances; you will think of old men who are preparing themselves at that very hour for a political career, or for travel, or for business. And what is baser than getting ready to live when you are already old? I should not name the author of this motto, except that it is somewhat unknown to fame and is not one of those popular sayings of Epicurus which I have allowed myself to praise and to appropriate. Farewell.

1349390488.0,21,self.Stoicism,10ymxz,"On cutting the hair - Musonius Rufus, Lecture XXI",ThatsOK,22,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/10ymxz/on_cutting_the_hair_musonius_rufus_lecture_xxi/,"**[1]**


He used to say that a man should cut the hair from the head for the same reason that we prune a vine, that is merely to remove what is useless.**[2]** (But just as the eyebrows or eyelashes which perform a service in protecting the eyes should not be cut, so) neither should the beard be cut from the chin (for it is not superfluous), but it too has been provided for us by nature as a kind of cover or protection. 

Moreover, the beard is nature's symbol of the male just as is the crest of the cock and the mane of the lion; so one ought to remove the growth of hair that becomes burdensome, but nothing of the beard; for the beard is no burden so long as the body is healthy and not afflicted with any disease for which it is necessary to cut the hair from the chin. 


The remark of Zeno was well made that it is quite as natural to cut the hair as it is to let it grow long, in order not to be burdened by too much of it nor hampered for any activity. For nature plainly keeps a more careful guard against deficiency than against excess, in both plants and animals, since the removal of excess is much easier and simpler than the addition of what is lacking. 


In both cases man's common sense ought to assist nature, so as to make up the deficiencies as much as possible and fill them out, and to lessen and eliminate the superfluous. Therefore the hair should be cut only to get rid of too much of it and not for looks, as some think they must, who shave their cheeks and imitate the beardless or, would you believe it, boys who are just beginning to grow a beard, and the hair on the head they do not cut all in the same way, but differently in front and behind. 


In fact that which seems to them good-looking is quite the opposite and does not differ from the efforts of women to make themselves beautiful. For they, you know, plait some parts of their hair, some they let fall free, and some they arrange in some other way in order to appear more beautiful. 


So men who cut their hair are obviously doing it out of a desire to appear handsome to those whom they wish to please, and so some of their hair they cut off completely, some they arrange so as to be most pleasing to the women and boys by whom they want to be admired. Nowadays there are even men who cut their hair to free themselves of the weight of it and they also shave their cheeks. Clearly such men have become slaves of luxurious living and are completely enervated, men who can endure being seen as womanish creatures, hermaphrodites, something which real men would avoid at all costs. How could hair be a burden to men? Unless, of course, one should say that feathers are a burden to birds also.

If he did not want something which is not in his power, how could he still be anxious? It is for this reason that one who sings to the lyre is not anxious when he is performing by himself, but when he enters the theatre, even if he has a very good voice and plays well: for he not only wants to perform well, but also to win a great name, and that is beyond his own control.

In fact, where he has knowledge there he has confidence. Bring in any unskilled person you like, and he pays no heed to him. On the other hand he is anxious whenever he has no knowledge and has made no study of the subject. What does this mean? He does not know what 'the people' is, nor what its praise is worth: he has learnt to strike the bottom note or the top note, but he does not know what the praise of the multitude is, nor what value it has in life; he has made no study of that. So he is bound to tremble and grow pale.

When I see a man, then, in this state of fear I cannot say that he is no performer with the lyre, but I can say something else of him, and not one thing but many. And first of all I call him a stranger and say, This man does not know where in the world he is; though he has been with us so long, he does not know the laws and customs of the City—what he may do and what he may not do—no, nor has he called in a lawyer at any time to tell him and explain to him what are the requirements of the law. Of course he does not draw up a will without knowing how he ought to draw it up, or without calling in one who knows, nor does he lightly put his seal to a guarantee or give a written security; but he calls in no lawyer when he is exercising the will to get and will to avoid, impulse and intention and purpose. What do I mean by 'having no lawyer'? I mean that he does not know that he is wishing to have what is not given him, and wishing not to have what he cannot avoid, and he does not know what is his own and what is not his own. If he did know, he would never feel hindrance or constraint or anxiety; how could he? Does any one fear about things which are not evil?

'No.'

Or again about things which are evil but are in his power to prevent? 'Certainly not.'

If, then, nothing beyond our will's control is either good or evil, and everything within our will's control depends entirely on ourselves, so that no one can take any such thing away from us or win it for us against our will, what room is left for anxiety? Yet we are anxious for our bit of a body, for our bit of property, for what Caesar will think, but are not anxious at all for what is within us. Am I anxious about not conceiving a false thought? No, for that depends on myself.

Or about indulging an impulse contrary to nature?

No, not about this either. So, when you see a man pale, just as the physician, judging from his colour, says, 'This man's spleen is out of order, or that man's liver', so do you say, 'This man is disordered in the will to get and the will to avoid, he is not in the right way, he is feverish'; for nothing else changes the complexion and causes a man to tremble and his teeth to chatter,

*and droop the knee and sink upon his feet*. **[1]**
                                  

[paragraph continues] Therefore Zeno was not distressed when he was going to meet Antigonus, for Antigonus had no authority over any of the things that Zeno admired, and Zeno paid no attention to the possessions of Antigonus. Antigonus was anxious when he was going to meet Zeno, and with good reason, for he wanted to please him, and this lay beyond his control; but Zeno did not wish to please Antigonus, any more than any artist cares to please one who has no skill.

Do I want to please you? Why should I? Do you know the standards by which man judges man? Have you made it your study to learn what a good man is and what a bad man is, and what makes each of them so? Why, then, are you not good yourself?

'Not good? What do you mean?' he replies.

Why, no good man whines or groans or laments, no good man grows pale or trembles or says, 'How will he receive me? What hearing will he give me?'

Slave, he will do as he thinks good. What concern have you in what does not belong to you? Is it not his fault if he gives a bad reception to what you offer?

'His fault, certainly.'

But can the fault be one man's and the harm another's?

'No.'

Why, then, are you anxious about another's concerns?

'Nay, but I am anxious to know how I am to address him.' What, is it not in your power to address him as you will? 'Yes, but I am afraid I may lose my self-possession.'

Are you afraid of losing your self-possession when you are going to write the name Dion?

'Certainly not.'

What is the reason? Is it not, that you have practised writing?

Of course it is. Or again, when you are about to read, would you not be in like case?

'Exactly.'

What is the reason? The reason is that every art contains within it an element of strength and confidence. Have you not practised speaking, then? What else did you study at school? You studied syllogisms and variable arguments. What for? Was it not that .you might converse with skill, and does not 'with skill' mean in good season, with security and good sense, and, more than that, without failure or hindrance, and, to crown all, with confidence?

'Yes.'

Well, if you are a rider and have to confront a man on foot in the plain, where you have the advantage of practice and he has not, are you anxious?

'Nay, but he has power to put me to death.'

Miserable man, tell the truth and be not a braggart nor claim to be a philosopher. Know who are your masters. As long as you give them this hold over your body, you must follow every one who is stronger than you.

But Socrates, who spoke to the Tyrants, to his judges, and in prison, in the tone we know, had studied speaking to some purpose. So had Diogenes, who spoke in the same tone to Alexander, to Philip, to the pirates, to his purchaser. . . . Leave this to those who have made it their concern, to the confident: and do you go to your own concerns and never leave them again. Go and sit in your corner and weave syllogisms and propound them to others,

We've had a few threads on here recently about pleasure and deprivation. Newcomers to Stoicism always want to know what specific pleasures to avoid.

Your greatest difficulty is with yourself; for you are your own stumbling-block. You do not know what you want. You are better at approving the right course than at following it out. You see where the true happiness lies, but you have not the courage to attain it. Let me tell you what it is that hinders you, inasmuch as you do not of yourself discern it.

2 You think that this condition, which you are to abandon, is one of importance, and after resolving upon that ideal state of calm into which you hope to pass, you are held back by the lustre of your present life, from which it is your intention to depart, just as if you were about to fall into a state of filth and darkness. This is a mistake, Lucilius; to go from your present life into the other is a promotion. There is the same difference between these two lives as there is between mere brightness and real light; the latter has a definite source within itself, the other borrows its radiance; the one is called forth by an illumination coming from the outside, and anyone who stands between the source and the object immediately turns the latter into a dense shadow; but the other has a glow that comes from within.

It is your own studies that will make you shine and will render you eminent, Allow me to mention the case of Epicurus. 3. He was writing**[1]** to Idomeneus and trying to recall him from a showy existence to sure and steadfast renown. Idomeneus was at that time a minister of state who exercised a rigorous authority and had important affairs in hand. ""If,"" said Epicurus, ""you are attracted by fame, my letters will make you more renowned than all the things which you cherish and which make you cherished."" 4. Did Epicurus speak falsely? Who would have known of Idomeneus, had not the philosopher thus engraved his name in those letters of his? All the grandees and satraps, even the king himself, who was petitioned for the title which Idomeneus sought, are sunk in deep oblivion. Cicero's letters keep the name of Atticus from perishing. It would have profited Atticus nothing to have an Agrippa for a son-in-law, a Tiberius for the husband of his grand-daughter, and a Drusus Caesar for a great-grandson; amid these mighty names his name would never be spoken, had not Cicero bound him to himself.**[2]** 5. The deep flood of time will roll over us; some few great men will raise their heads above it, and, though destined at the last to depart into the same realms of silence, will battle against oblivion and maintain their ground for long.

That which Epicurus could promise his friend, this I promise you, Lucilius. I shall find favour among later generations; I can take with me names that will endure as long as mine. Our poet Vergil promised an eternal name to two heroes, and is keeping his promise:**[3]**

    Blest heroes twain! If power my song possess,
    The record of your names shall never be
    Erased from out the book of Time, while yet
    Aeneas' tribe shall keep the Capitol,
    That rock immovable, and Roman sire
    Shall empire hold.

6 Whenever men have been thrust forward by fortune, whenever they have become part and parcel of another's influence, they have found abundant favour, their houses have been thronged, only so long as they themselves have kept their position; when they themselves have left it, they have slipped at once from the memory of men. But in the case of innate ability, the respect in which it is held increases, and not only does honour accrue to the man himself, but whatever has attached itself to his memory is passed on from one to another.**[4]**

7 In order that Idomeneus may not be introduced free of charge into my letter, he shall make up the indebtedness from his own account. It was to him that Epicurus addressed the well-known saying**[5]** urging him to make Pythocles rich, but not rich in the vulgar and equivocal way. ""If you wish,"" said he, ""to make Pythocles rich, do not add to his store of money, but subtract from his desires."" 8. This idea is too clear to need explanation, and too clever to need reinforcement. There is, however, one point on which I would warn you, – not to consider that this statement applies only to riches; its value will be the same, no matter how you apply it. ""If you wish to make Pythocles honourable, do not add to his honours, but subtract from his desires""; ""if you wish Pythocles to have pleasure for ever, do not add to his pleasures, but subtract from his desires""; ""if you wish to make Pythocles an old man, filling his life to the full, do not add to his years, but subtract from his desires."" 9. There is no reason why you should hold that these words belong to Epicurus alone; they are public property. I think we ought to do in philosophy as they are wont to do in the Senate: when someone has made a motion, of which I approve to a certain extent, I ask him to make his motion in two parts, and I vote for the part which I approve. So I am all the more glad to repeat the distinguished words of Epicurus, in order that I may prove to those who have recourse to him through a bad motive, thinking that they will have in him a screen for their own vices, that they must live honourably, no matter what school they follow.

10 Go to his Garden and read the motto carved there:

    ""Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good is pleasure.""

The care-taker of that abode, a kindly host, will be ready for you; he will welcome you with barley-meal and serve you water also in abundance, with these words: ""Have you not been well entertained?"" ""This garden,"" he says, ""does not whet your appetite; it quenches it. Nor does it make you more thirsty with every drink; it slakes the thirst by a natural cure, a cure that demands no fee. This is the 'pleasure' in which I have grown old.""

11 In speaking with you, however, I refer to those desires which refuse alleviation, which must be bribed to cease. For in regard to the exceptional desires, which may be postponed, which may be chastened and checked, I have this one thought to share with you: a pleasure of that sort is according to our nature, but it is not according to our needs; one owes nothing to it; whatever is expended upon it is a free gift. The belly will not listen to advice; it makes demands, it importunes. And yet it is not a troublesome creditor; you can send it away at small cost, provided only that you give it what you owe, not merely all you are able to give. Farewell.

Where are the counsels of your school, which order a man to die in the midst of active work?"" As to the course**[1]** which I seem to you to be urging on you now and then, my object in shutting myself up and locking the door is to be able to help a greater number. I never spend a day in idleness; I appropriate even a part of the night for study. I do not allow time for sleep but yield to it when I must, and when my eyes are wearied with waking and ready to fall shut, I keep them at their task. 2 I have withdrawn not only from men, but from affairs, especially from my own affairs; I am working for later generations, writing down some ideas that may be of assistance to them. There are certain wholesome counsels, which may be compared to prescriptions of useful drugs; these I am putting into writing; for I have found them helpful in ministering to my own sores, which, if not wholly cured, have at any rate ceased to spread.

3 I point other men to the right path, which I have found late in life, when wearied with wandering. I cry out to them: ""Avoid whatever pleases the throng: avoid the gifts of Chance! Halt before every good which Chance brings to you, in a spirit of doubt and fear; for it is the dumb animals and fish that are deceived by tempting hopes. Do you call these things the 'gifts' of Fortune? They are snares. And any man among you who wishes to live a life of safety will avoid, to the utmost of his power, these limed twigs of her favour, by which we mortals, most wretched in this respect also, are deceived; for we think that we hold them in our grasp, but they hold us in theirs. 4 Such a career leads us into precipitous ways, and life on such heights ends in a fall. Moreover, we cannot even stand up against prosperity when she begins to drive us to leeward; nor can we go down, either, 'with the ship at least on her course,' or once for all;**[2]** Fortune does not capsize us, - she plunges our bows under**[3]** and dashes us on the rocks.

5 ""Hold fast, then, to this sound and wholesome rule of life - that you indulge the body only so far as is needful for good health. The body should be treated more rigorously, that it may not be disobedient to the mind. Eat merely to relieve your hunger; drink merely to quench your thirst; dress merely to keep out the cold; house yourself merely as a protection against personal discomfort. It matters little whether the house be built of turf, or of variously coloured imported marble; understand that a man is sheltered just as well by a thatch as by a roof of gold. Despise everything that useless toil creates as an ornament and an object of beauty. And reflect that nothing except the soul is worthy of wonder; for to the soul, if it be great, naught is great.""**[4]**

6 When I commune in such terms with myself and with future generations, do you not think that I am doing more good than when I appear as counsel in court, or stamp my seal upon a will, or lend my assistance in the senate, by word or action, to a candidate? Believe me, those who seem to be busied with nothing are busied with the greater tasks; they are dealing at the same time with things mortal and things immortal.

7 But I must stop, and pay my customary contribution, to balance this letter. The payment shall not be made from my own property; for I am still conning Epicurus.**[5]** I read to-day, in his works, the following sentence: ""If you would enjoy real freedom, you must be the slave of Philosophy."" The man who submits and surrenders himself to her is not kept waiting; he is emancipated**[6]** on the spot. For the very service of Philosophy is freedom.

8 It is likely that you will ask me why I quote so many of Epicurus's noble words instead of words taken from our own school. But is there any reason why you should regard them as sayings of Epicurus and not common property? How many poets give forth ideas that have been uttered, or may be uttered, by philosophers! I need not touch upon the tragedians and our writers of national drama;**[7]** for these last are also somewhat serious, and stand half-way between comedy and tragedy. What a quantity of sagacious verses lie buried in the mime! How many of Publilius's lines are worthy of being spoken by buskin-clad actors, as well as by wearers of the slipper!**[8]** 9 I shall quote one verse of his, which concerns philosophy, and particularly that phase of it which we were discussing a moment ago, wherein he says that the gifts of Chance are not to be regarded as part of our possessions:

    Still alien is whatever you have gained
    By coveting.  
**[9]**

10 I recall that you yourself expressed this idea much more happily and concisely:

    What Chance has made yours is not really yours. 
**[10]**

And a third, spoken by you still more happily, shall not be omitted:

    The good that could be given, can be removed.  
**[11]**

I shall not charge this up to the expense account, because I have given it to you from your own stock. Farewell.

&gt;Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on!""

For instance, for Epictetus, one's duty in life is to recognize and follow the assignment that God/the gods have given him.  For Nietzsche, he seems to say a lot of the same things, but from a radically different cosmological perspective.  He shifts the act of submission from the will of God to the will of the individual, but not in a narcissistic way.  In ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", for him the act of redemption is when a person can look at their past and say, ""thus I willed it,"" instead of the passive, ""thus it was.""  There's also the role that amor fati plays, so much so that Nietzsche suggests that the litmus test of embracing one's fate is being willing to submit to reliving one's life over and over again for eternity (eternal recurrence).

I apologize if this sort of thread has been posted already. I thought Stoicism could give me tools to deal with a problem I've had since childhood--I'm afraid of vomiting. The fact that I've managed to avoid being sick since I was 7 probably hasn't helped, as I haven't had to face it, but I'm now starting a round of antibiotics which may cause quite a bit of nausea or even throwing up.

What happens when I'm faced with nausea, usually, is I begin to shake with nervousness and can't focus on anything other than monitoring whether the feeling is getting better or worse (as if I could do something about it either way). When a fear is so great that it can completely ensnare ones attention, what should a stoic do? I know intellectually not to be concerned with things that I can't control, but in the moment, philosophy can feel so weak. 

Does anyone have any practices or tricks to put things back in perspective during times of stress?

Update: Thank you everyone for your suggestions and resources. Instead of shaking with worry and ruining my enjoyment of a long weekend, I read Epictetus/Seneca/Aurelius whenever I felt nervous and was immediately calmed.

1. If I want something, I should expect to work for it.

2. If something bothers me and I cannot help it, I should not let it bother me.

3. If something bothers me and I can help it, I should fix it.

4. Others have the power to disrupt my tranquility, but I should try to avoid giving them that power.

Okay, so I'm fairly new to stoicism and I've only read a few letters, about half of Meditations, and Guide to the Good Life.

Background:

I like having a (reasonably) clean house; it makes me happy. I'm in college, living with four other guys, so I understand that I have to be lenient in my definition of reasonably clean. Last semester we had a few fights where I had to tell people to stop leaving dishes in the sink. The worst offender was a bowl that was left in the sink for almost a month before I gave in and cleaned it. We had a lot of house talks and now we have a time limit for how long you can just leave your bowls around, etc. We recently got a new housemate. He came in saying he was very tidy and he was given the rundown on the rules of the house. In the two months that he has been here, he has only added to his pile of dishes in the sink. It was so bad that at one point about half of his dishes fell out of the sink because they were stacked so high and they broke. Now, nobody in the house cares about this except for me. I've asked them a few times, and they always say that I care too much and that they ""don't give a fuck about how clean the house is."" Well, I do.

So, here's my situation: Today, I cleaned two sinks worth of this guy's dishes and cleaned all of the other cups/etc he's left around the house. I honestly don't mind it. The benefits that having the house clean give me outweigh the cost of cleaning his dishes (I just actively meditate while cleaning, so it's hardly a chore). The reason I never cleaned the dishes before was based on principle. I thought that if I kept cleaning his dishes, he'd just get used to it and leave them for me to clean. 

I'm thinking now, however: if I want a clean house, I should expect to have to clean the house. His behavior bothers me, and I've **tried** to help it, by asking him to do his dishes, but there were no results. Seeing the stack of dishes every single day disrupted my tranquility to the point where I'd avoid the kitchen entirely. His behavior bothers me **and** the dishes bother me. I can't do anything about the former, but I can stay on top of the latter. Is it wrong to think that I should just do the dishes and stop giving a damn about his behavior? To take away the ""his"" from ""his dirty dishes"" and just let them be dirty dishes; of which, I'll have no qualms against cleaning?

Thanks for reading. And please don't reply with, ""You wrote an entire post about this guy, you're letting it get to you too much, etc"" because in all honesty, it's not getting to me that much, but I do want some insight if this is sound thinking for future disruptions.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_1dfa77,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1dfa77/is_this_way_of_thinking_correct_if_not_can/,

For now, although you love me, you are not yet my friend. ""But,"" you reply, ""are these words of different meaning?"" Nay, more, they are totally unlike in meaning.**[1]** A friend loves you, of course; but one who loves you is not in every case your friend. Friendship, accordingly, is always helpful, but love sometimes even does harm. Try to perfect yourself, if for no other reason, in order that you may learn how to love.


2 Hasten, therefore, in order that, while thus perfecting yourself for my benefit, you may not have learned perfection for the benefit of another. To be sure, I am already deriving some profit by imagining that we two shall be of one mind, and that whatever portion of my strength has yielded to age will return to me from your strength, although there is not so very much difference in our ages. 3. But yet I wish to rejoice in the accomplished fact. We feel a joy over those whom we love, even when separated from them, but such a joy is light and fleeting; the sight of a man, and his presence, and communion with him, afford something of living pleasure; this is true, at any rate, if one not only sees the man one desires, but the sort of man one desires. Give yourself to me, therefore, as a gift of great price, and, that you may strive the more, reflect that you yourself are mortal, and that I am old. 4. Hasten to find me, but hasten to find yourself first. Make progress, and, before all else, endeavour to be consistent with yourself. And when you would find out whether you have accomplished anything, consider whether you desire the same things today that you desired yesterday. A shifting of the will indicates that the mind is at sea, heading in various directions, according to the course of the wind. But that which is settled and solid does not wander from its place. This is the blessed lot of the completely wise man, and also, to a certain extent, of him who is progressing and has made some headway. Now what is the difference between these two classes of men? The one is in motion, to be sure, but does not change its position; it merely tosses up and down where it is; the other is not in motion at all. Farewell.

I visited lately my country-place, and protested against the money which was spent on the tumble-down building. My bailiff maintained that the flaws were not due to his own carelessness; ""he was doing everything possible, but the house was old."" And this was the house which grew under my own hands! What has the future in store for me, if stones of my own age are already crumbling? 2 I was angry, and I embraced the first opportunity to vent my spleen in the bailiff's presence. ""It is clear,"" I cried, ""that these plane-trees are neglected; they have no leaves. Their branches are so gnarled and shrivelled; the boles are so rough and unkempt! This would not happen, if someone loosened the earth at their feet, and watered them."" The bailiff swore by my protecting deity that ""he was doing everything possible, and never relaxed his efforts, but those trees were old."" Between you and me, I had planted those trees myself, I had seen them in their first leaf. 3 Then I turned to the door and asked: ""Who is that broken-down dotard? You have done well to place him at the entrance; for he is outward bound.**[1]** Where did you get him? What pleasure did it give you to take up for burial some other man's dead?""**[2]** But the slave said: ""Don't you know me, sir? I am Felicio; you used to bring me little images.**[3]** My father was Philositus the steward, and I am your pet slave."" ""The man is clean crazy,"" I remarked. ""Has my pet slave become a little boy again? But it is quite possible; his teeth are just dropping out.""**[4]**

4 I owe it to my country-place that my old age became apparent whithersoever I turned. Let us cherish and love old age; for it is full of pleasure if one knows how to use it. Fruits are most welcome when almost over; youth is most charming at its close; the last drink delights the toper, the glass which souses him and puts the finishing touch on his drunkenness. 5 Each pleasure reserves to the end the greatest delights which it contains. Life is most delightful when it is on the downward slope, but has not yet reached the abrupt decline. And I myself believe that the period which stands, so to speak, on the edge of the roof, possesses pleasures of its own. Or else the very fact of our not wanting pleasures has taken the place of the pleasures themselves. How comforting it is to have tired out one's appetites, and to have done with them! 6 ""But,"" you say, ""it is a nuisance to be looking death in the face!"" Death, however, should be looked in the face by young and old alike. We are not summoned according to our rating on the censor's list.**[5]** Moreover, no one is so old that it would be improper for him to hope for another day of existence. And one day, mind you, is a stage on life's journey.

Our span of life is divided into parts; it consists of large circles enclosing smaller. One circle embraces and bounds the rest; it reaches from birth to the last day of existence. The next circle limits the period of our young manhood. The third confines all of childhood in its circumference. Again, there is, in a class by itself, the year; it contains within itself all the divisions of time by the multiplication of which we get the total of life. The month is bounded by a narrower ring. The smallest circle of all is the day; but even a day has its beginning and its ending, its sunrise and its sunset. 7 Hence Heraclitus, whose obscure style gave him his surname,**[6]** remarked: ""One day is equal to every day."" Different persons have interpreted the saying in different ways. Some hold that days are equal in number of hours, and this is true; for if by ""day"" we mean twenty-four hours' time, all days must be equal, inasmuch as the night acquires what the day loses. But others maintain that one day is equal to all days through resemblance, because the very longest space of time possesses no element which cannot be found in a single day, - namely, light and darkness, - and even to eternity day makes these alternations**[7]** more numerous, not different when it is shorter and different again when it is longer. 8 Hence, every day ought to be regulated as if it closed the series, as if it rounded out and completed our existence.

Pacuvius, who by long occupancy made Syria his own,**[8]** used to hold a regular burial sacrifice in his own honour, with wine and the usual funeral feasting, and then would have himself carried from the dining-room to his chamber, while eunuchs applauded and sang in Greek to a musical accompaniment: ""He has lived his life, he has lived his life!"" 9 Thus Pacuvius had himself carried out to burial every day. Let us, however, do from a good motive what he used to do from a debased motive; let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say:

   
*I have lived; the course which Fortune set for me*
*Is finished*.**[9]**

And if God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad hearts. That man is happiest, and is secure in his own possession of himself, who can await the morrow without apprehension. When a man has said: ""I have lived!"", every morning he arises he receives a bonus.

10 But now I ought to close my letter. ""What?"" you say; ""shall it come to me without any little offering? ""Be not afraid; it brings something, - nay, more than something, a great deal. For what is more noble than the following saying**[10]** of which I make this letter the bearer: ""It is wrong to live under constraint; but no man is constrained to live under constraint."" Of course not. On all sides lie many short and simple paths to freedom; and let us thank God that no man can be kept in life. We may spurn the very constraints that hold us. 11 ""Epicurus,"" you reply, ""uttered these words; what are you doing with another's property?"" Any truth, I maintain, is my own property. And I shall continue to heap quotations from Epicurus upon you, so that all persons who swear by the words of another, and put a value upon the speaker and not upon the thing spoken, may understand that the best ideas are common property.

And in your very next sentence you warn me not to discuss with him all the matters that concern you, saying that even you yourself are not accustomed to do this; in other words, you have in the same letter affirmed and denied that he is your friend. 2 Now if you used this word of ours**[1]** in the popular sense, and called him ""friend"" in the same way in which we speak of all candidates for election as ""honourable gentlemen,"" and as we greet all men whom we meet casually, if their names slip us for the moment, with the salutation ""my dear sir,"" - so be it. But if you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship means. Indeed, I would have you discuss everything with a friend; but first of all discuss the man himself. When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment. Those persons indeed put last first and confound their duties, who, violating the rules of Theophrastus,**[2]** judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him their friend after they have judged him. Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself. 3 As to yourself, although you should live in such a way that you trust your own self with nothing which you could not entrust even to your enemy, yet, since certain matters occur which convention keeps secret, you should share with a friend at least all your worries and reflections. Regard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal. Some, for example, fearing to be deceived, have taught men to deceive; by their suspicions they have given their friend the right to do wrong. Why need I keep back any words in the presence of my friend? Why should I not regard myself as alone when in his company?

4 There is a class of men who communicate, to anyone whom they meet, matters which should be revealed to friends alone, and unload upon the chance listener whatever irks them. Others, again, fear to confide in their closest intimates; and if it were possible, they would not trust even themselves, burying their secrets deep in their hearts. But we should do neither. It is equally faulty to trust everyone and to trust no one. Yet the former fault is, I should say, the more ingenuous, the latter the more safe. 5 In like manner you should rebuke these two kinds of men, - both those who always lack repose, and those who are always in repose. For love of bustle is not industry, - it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind. And true repose does not consist in condemning all motion as merely vexation; that kind of repose is slackness and inertia. 6 Therefore, you should note the following saying, taken from my reading in Pomponius: ""Some men shrink into dark corners, to such a degree that they see darkly by day."" No, men should combine these tendencies, and he who reposes should act and he who acts should take repose. Discuss the problem with Nature; she will tell you that she has created both day and night. Farewell.

Make yourself believe the truth of my words, - that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose. 2 What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.

Therefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. 3 Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious commodity, - time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful recipient cannot repay.

4 You may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising. I confess frankly: my expense account balances, as you would expect from one who is free-handed but careful. I cannot boast that I waste nothing, but I can at least tell you what I am wasting, and the cause and manner of the loss; I can give you the reasons why I am a poor man. My situation, however, is the same as that of many who are reduced to slender means through no fault of their own: every one forgives them, but no one comes to their rescue.

5 What is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however, to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask.**[1]** Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile. Farewell.

Sure, there are things that are not under direct, obvious control.  I can't change whether it rains tomorrow.  But there are lots of things that I *could* change if I invested significant time and effort.  Hypothetical - let's say you're unhappy with the way you look.  I don't mean ""I wish I could lose five pounds"", but if you want to look totally different in a way that would require major cosmetic surgery.  You can have the nose you want, the chin you want, the eyes, etc.  But it'll take a whole ton of time and money and will be a tremendous emotional investment.

Is your appearance to that degree considered something you can change (because it's not impossible) or something you can't (because it's really, really difficult)?  How do you know the difference, especially in this modern day and age where you can get or do pretty much anything with enough money or time?

Or let's say you work with someone you just don't get along with.  No big deal, this happens all the time.  You could accept that you just won't be compatible with this person, and thus the personality clash between the two becomes unchangeable and therefore something to not worry about.  But if you put a lot of time into working on the relationship you may be able to find a way to get along.

One particular point stood out to me, and it was that Compassion seemed to be missing from Aristotle and Justice seemed to be missing from Buddhism.

Along with listing out the 4 cardinal virtues yesterday, it got me thinking about where I think compassion comes from in Stoicism, and whether I should consider it up there with the other 4 virtues (my answer is yes).  So I broke out my copy of Meditations and turned to the beginning of book 2, passage 1 (2.1):

&gt;Say to yourself at break of day, I shall meet with meddling, violent, treacherous, envious and ungrateful men.  All these vices have fallen to them because they have no knowledge of good and bad.  But I, who have beheld the nature of the good, and seen that it is the right; and of the bad, and seen that it is the wrong; and of the wrongdoer himself, and seeing that his nature is akin to my own - not because he is of the same blood and seed, but because he shares with me in mind and a portion of the divine - I, then, can neither be harmed by any of these men, nor can I become angry with one who is akin to me, nor can I hate him, for we have come into being to work together, like feet, hands, or eyelids, or the two rows of teeth in our upper and lower jaws.  To work against one another is therefore contrary to nature; and to be angry with another and turn away from him is surely to work against him.

So I view compassion to be perhaps an aspect of justice - how do we interact with measured selfishness and selflessness in a voluntary way?  By recognizing that our good is tied up with working for the good of other humans and humanity as a whole.

Why does this make virtue the only thing good in itself?,stoicismftw,21,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1hw9fl/virtuous_action_is_the_only_thing_we_can_control/,"The Stoics believe that virtue, or virtuous choice, is the only thing that is good in itself. But why is this? It has something to do with the fact that it is the only thing we can control. (This is not *just* a coincidence.) But how does this argument run?

Marcus Aurelius makes an argument something like this:

1. For something to be good in itself, it must not befall good and evil people alike.
2. The will, or virtue, is the only thing that does not befall good and evil people alike.
3. Therefore, virtue is the only thing good in itself.

In that argument, #2 seems to beg the question, since the good person just is the virtuous one, i.e. the one whom virtue befalls.

Or, it might go something like this:

1. Tranquility is the only thing desirable in itself.
2. Virtue is the only path to tranquility.
3. If A is good in itself, and B is the only way of obtaining A, then B is good in itself.
4. So, virtue is good in itself.

In that argument, #3 seems false, since it confuses instrumental with intrinsic goodness.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**F.A.Q**

**What's a Stoic Journal?**

Simply put, a Stoic journal is used to reflect on one's ongoing practice of Stoicism. You can use it to reflect on events throughout the day (e.g: ""I was angry at what person Y did in the morning. This anger was irrational because what person Y did could in no way harm me, and what moved me to anger was my own thoughts, I shouldn't be mad at person Y because s/he doesn't know better, etc""), or to rephrase Stoic precepts that you've come accross so you can better digest them (*ala Marcus Aurelius' Meditations), or in whatever way you feel benefits you the most. The idea is to get you thinking about Stoic concepts daily, and how they can/should be applied to the situation's you'll come across IRL.

**What's a journal buddy?**

A journal buddy is a fellow Stoic journal keeper who will help to hold you accountable to your journaling habit (and vice versa, of course). Journaling on your own can be trying at times, because once you fall off the habit of journaling, you might not find the motivation to pick it up again. Having a journal buddy to keep you accountable (hopefully) solves that problem. This accountability can be achieved by sharing journal entries with each other daily (via the reddit PM system, or email, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc).

You do not run hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for such restlessness is the sign of a disordered spirit. The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company. 2 Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner. 3 Food does no good and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.

Accordingly, since you cannot read all the books which you may possess, it is enough to possess only as many books as you can read. 4 ""*But*,"" you reply, ""*I wish to dip first into one book and then into another*."" I tell you that it is the sign of an overnice appetite to toy with many dishes; for when they are manifold and varied, they cloy but do not nourish. So you should always read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall back upon those whom you read before. Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day. 5 This is my own custom; from the many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself.

The thought for today is one which I discovered in Epicurus;**[1]** for I am wont to cross over even into the enemy's camp, - not as a deserter, but as a scout. 6 He says: ""*Contented poverty is an honourable estate*."" Indeed, if it be contented, it is not poverty at all. It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor. What does it matter how much a man has laid up in his safe, or in his warehouse, how large are his flocks and how fat his dividends, if he covets his neighbour's property, and reckons, not his past gains, but his hopes of gains to come? Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough. Farewell.

ταράσσει τοὺς ἀνθρώπους οὐ τὰ πράγματα, ἀλλὰ τὰ περὶ τῶν πραγμάτων δόγματα· οἷον ὁ θάνατος οὐδὲν δεινόν (ἐπεὶ καὶ Σωκράτει ἂν ἐφαίνετο), ἀλλὰ τὸ δόγμα τὸ περὶ τοῦ θανάτου, διότι δεινόν, ἐκεῖνο τὸ δεινόν ἐστιν. ὅταν οὖν ἐμποδιζώμεθα ἢ ταρασσώμεθα ἢ λυπώμεθα, μηδέποτε ἄλλον αἰτιώμεθα, ἀλλ’ ἑαυτούς, τοῦτ’ ἔστι τὰ ἑαυτῶν δόγματα. ἀπαιδεύτου ἔργον τὸ ἄλλοις ἐγκαλεῖν, ἐφ’ οἷς αὐτὸς πράσσει κακῶς· ἠργμένου παιδεύεσθαι τὸ ἑαυτῷ· πεπαιδευμένου τὸ μήτε ἄλλῳ μήτε ἑαυτῷ.

*It is not things which disturb humans, but their opinions of things.  For example, death is nothing terrible (since it would have appeared so to even Socrates), but the opinion about death, that it is terrible, is the terrible thing.  So whenever we are impeded or disturbed or irritated, let us never blame another, but ourselves, that is, our own opinions.  It is the act of someone ignorant to accuse another on account of oneself doing badly.  (It is the act) of one starting to learn (to blame) oneself.  (It is the act) of one who has learned (to blame) neither another nor oneself.*

The word I've translated ""things"" is πράγματα *pragmata*.  This is a very useful little word in Greek, covering a giant range of meanings, ""things, matters, business,"" and even ""irritations, troubles.""  The first of the Epicurean *Principal Doctrines* notes that a blessed/happy being neither has *pragmata* nor furnishes them for another.

So, the word I've translated ""opinions"" is our friend δόγμα *dogma*.  Obviously this has developed new senses over time.

The word I've translated ""disturb"" is ταράσσω, which I've always found interesting.  The base meaning is to stir or agitate, mixing things up.  This is the same root as the word ""ataraxia"" which is such an important concept to the Epicureans.  It means something like ""calmness.""  The Stoics, of course, aimed at *apathia*.  It's interesting both have privative (lack, negation) nouns as important goals.

The field of parentheses in the last two sentences is to give a hint at the tendency to leave out words that can be inferred from a previous sentence.

I will confess I have always found the very last sentence a bit of a puzzle, not to translate but to figure out how this ties into Stoic ethics.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_r1lx6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/r1lx6/enchiridion_5/,

The appetite for sexual union for the production of offspring is, also, common to all animals, together with a certain degree of care for their offspring.

But between man and beast there is this essential difference, that the latter, moved by sense alone, adapts himself only to that which is present in place and time, having very little cognizance of the past or the future. Man, on the other hand — because he is possessed of reason, by which he discerns consequences, sees the causes of things, understands the rise and progress of events, compares similar objects, and connects and associates the future with the present — easily takes into view the whole course of life, and provides things necessary for it. Nature too, by virtue of reason, brings man into relations of mutual intercourse and society with his fellow-men; generates in him a special love for his children; prompts him to promote and attend social gatherings and public assemblies; and awakens in him the desire to provide what may suffice for the support and nourishment, not of himself alone, but of his wife, his children, and others whom he holds dear and is bound to protect. This care rouses men’s minds, and makes them more efficient in action. The research and investigation of truth, also, are a special property of man. Thus, when we are free from necessary occupations, we want to see, or hear, or learn something, and regard the knowledge of things either secret or wonderful as essential to our living happily and well. To this desire for seeing the truth is annexed a certain craving for precedence, insomuch that the man well endowed by nature is willing to render obedience to no one, unless to a preceptor, or a teacher, or one who holds a just and legitimate sway for the general good. Hence are derived greatness of mind and contempt for the vicissitudes of human fortune. Nor does it indicate any feeble force of nature and of reason, that of all animals man alone has a sense of order, and decency, and moderation in action and in speech. Thus no other animal feels the beauty, elegance, symmetry, of the things that he sees; while by nature and reason, man, transferring these qualities from the eyes to the mind, considers that much more, even, are beauty, consistency, and order to be preserved in purposes and acts, and takes heed that he do nothing indecorous or effeminate, and still more, that in all his thoughts and deeds he neither do nor think anything lascivious. From these elements the right, which is the object of our inquiry, is composed and created; and this, even if it be not ennobled in title, yet is honorable, and even if no one praise it, we truly pronounce it in its very nature worthy of all praise.

5 You behold, indeed, my son Marcus, the very form and, as it were, the countenance of the right, which, were it seen by the eyes, as Plato says, would awaken the intensest love of wisdom. But whatever is right springs from one of four sources. It consists either in the perception and skilful treatment of the truth; or in maintaining good-fellowship with men, giving to every one his due, and keeping faith in contracts and promises; or in the greatness and strength of a lofty and unconquered mind; or in the order and measure that constitute moderation and temperance. Although these four are connected and intertwined with one another, yet duties of certain kinds proceed from each of them; as from the division first named, including wisdom and prudence, proceed the investigation and discovery of truth, as the peculiar office of that virtue. For in proportion as one sees clearly what is the inmost and essential truth with regard to any subject, and can demonstrate it with equal acuteness and promptness, he is wont to be regarded, and justly, as of transcendent discretion and wisdom. Therefore truth is submitted to this virtue as the material of which it treats, and with which it is conversant. The other three virtues have for their sphere the providing and preserving of those things on which the conduct of life depends, so that the fellowship and union of society may be maintained, and that superiority and greatness of mind may shine forth, not only in the increase of resources and the acquisition of objects of desire for one’s self, and for those dependent on him, but much more in a position from which one can look down on these very things. But order, and consistency, and moderation, and similar qualities have their scope in affairs that demand not merely the movement of the mind, but some outward action; for it is by bringing to the concerns of daily life a certain method and order that we shall maintain honor and propriety.

1359060621.0,15,self.Stoicism,177lvh,"On Old Age and Death - Seneca, Letter 26",ThatsOK,17,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/177lvh/on_old_age_and_death_seneca_letter_26/,"1 I was just lately telling you that I was within sight of old age.**[1]** I am now afraid that I have left old age behind me. For some other word would now apply to my years, or at any rate to my body; since old age means a time of life that is weary rather than crushed. You may rate me in the worn-out class, – of those who are nearing the end.

2 Nevertheless, I offer thanks to myself, with you as witness; for I feel that age has done no damage to my mind, though I feel its effects on my constitution. Only my vices, and the outward aids to these vices, have reached senility; my mind is strong and rejoices that it has but slight connexion with the body. It has laid aside the greater part of its load. It is alert; it takes issue with me on the subject of old age; it declares that old age is its time of bloom. 3. Let me take it at its word, and let it make the most of the advantages it possesses. The mind bids me do some thinking and consider how much of this peace of spirit and moderation of character I owe to wisdom and how much to my time of life; it bids me distinguish carefully what I cannot do and what I do not want to do. . . .**[2]** For why should one complain or regard it as a disadvantage, if powers which ought to come to an end have failed? 4. ""But,"" you say, ""it is the greatest possible disadvantage to be worn out and to die off, or rather, if I may speak literally, to melt away! For we are not suddenly smitten and laid low; we are worn away, and every day reduces our powers to a certain extent.""

But is there any better end to it all than to glide off to one's proper haven, when nature slips the cable? Not that there is anything painful in a shock and a sudden departure from existence; it is merely because this other way of departure is easy, – a gradual withdrawal. I, at any rate, as if the test were at hand and the day were come which is to pronounce its decision concerning all the years of my life, watch over myself and commune thus with myself: 5. ""The showing which we have made up to the present time, in word or deed, counts for nothing. All this is but a trifling and deceitful pledge of our spirit, and is wrapped in much charlatanism. I shall leave it to Death to determine what progress I have made. Therefore with no faint heart I am making ready for the day when, putting aside all stage artifice and actor's rouge, I am to pass judgment upon myself, – whether I am merely declaiming brave sentiments, or whether I really feel them; whether all the bold threats I have uttered against fortune are a pretence and a farce. 6. Put aside the opinion of the world; it is always wavering and always takes both sides. Put aside the studies which you have pursued throughout your life; Death will deliver the final judgment in your case. This is what I mean: your debates and learned talks, your maxims gathered from the teachings of the wise, your cultured conversation, – all these afford no proof of the real strength of your soul. Even the most timid man can deliver a bold speech. What you have done in the past will be manifest only at the time when you draw your last breath. I accept the terms; I do not shrink from the decision."" 7. This is what I say to myself, but I would have you think that I have said it to you also. You are younger; but what does that matter? There is no fixed count of our years. You do not know where death awaits you; so be ready for it everywhere.

8 I was just intending to stop, and my hand was making ready for the closing sentence; but the rites are still to be performed and the travelling money for the letter disbursed. And just assume that I am not telling where I intend to borrow the necessary sum; you know upon whose coffers I depend. Wait for me but a moment, and I will pay you from my own account;**[3]** meanwhile, Epicurus will oblige me with these words:**[4]** ""Think on death,"" or rather, if you prefer the phrase, on ""migration to heaven."" 9. The meaning is clear, – that it is a wonderful thing to learn thoroughly how to die. You may deem it superfluous to learn a text that can be used only once; but that is just the reason why we ought to think on a thing. When we can never prove whether we really know a thing, we must always be learning it. 10. ""Think on death."" In saying this, he bids us think on freedom. He who has learned to die has unlearned slavery; he is above any external power, or, at any rate, he is beyond it. What terrors have prisons and bonds and bars for him? His way out is clear. There is only one chain which binds us to life, and that is the love of life. The chain may not be cast off, but it may be rubbed away, so that, when necessity shall demand, nothing may retard or hinder us from being ready to do at once that which at some time we are bound to do. Farewell.

They would add to the opening words of a letter: ""If you are well, it is well; I also am well."" Persons like ourselves would do well to say. ""If you are studying philosophy, it is well."" For this is just what ""being well"" means. Without philosophy the mind is sickly, and the body, too, though it may be very powerful, is strong only as that of a madman or a lunatic is strong. 2. This, then, is the sort of health you should primarily cultivate; the other kind of health comes second, and will involve little effort, if you wish to be well physically. It is indeed foolish, my dear Lucilius, and very unsuitable for a cultivated man, to work hard over developing the muscles and broadening the shoulders and strengthening the lungs. For although your heavy feeding produce good results and your sinews grow solid, you can never be a match, either in strength or in weight, for a first-class bull. Besides, by overloading the body with food you strangle the soul and render it less active. Accordingly, limit the flesh as much as possible, and allow free play to the spirit. 3. Many inconveniences beset those who devote themselves to such pursuits. In the first place, they have their exercises, at which they must work and waste their life-force and render it less fit to bear a strain or the severer studies. Second, their keen edge is dulled by heavy eating. Besides, they must take orders from slaves of the vilest stamp, - men who alternate between the oil-flask**[1]** and the flagon, whose day passes satisfactorily if they have got up a good perspiration and quaffed, to make good what they have lost in sweat, huge draughts of liquor which will sink deeper because of their fasting. Drinking and sweating, - it's the life of a dyspeptic!**[2]**

4 Now there are short and simple exercises which tire the body rapidly, and so save our time; and time is something of which we ought to keep strict account. These exercises are running, brandishing weights, and jumping, - high-jumping or broad-jumping, or the kind which I may call, ""the Priest's dance,""**[3]** or, in slighting terms, ""the clothes-cleaner's jump.""**[4]** Select for practice any one of these, and you will find it plain and easy. 5. But whatever you do, come back soon from body to mind. The mind must be exercised both day and night, for it is nourished by moderate labour. and this form of exercise need not be hampered by cold or hot weather, or even by old age. Cultivate that good which improves with the years. 6. Of course I do not command you to be always bending over your books and your writing materials; the mind must have a change, - but a change of such a kind that it is not unnerved, but merely unbent. Riding in a litter shakes up the body, and does not interfere with study: one may read, dictate, converse, or listen to another; nor does walking prevent any of these things.

7 You need not scorn voice-culture; but I forbid you to practise raising and lowering your voice by scales and specific intonations. What if you should next propose to take lessons in walking! If you consult the sort of person whom starvation has taught new tricks, you will have someone to regulate your steps, watch every mouthful as you eat, and go to such lengths as you yourself, by enduring him and believing in him, have encouraged his effrontery to go. ""What, then?"" you will ask; ""is my voice to begin at the outset with shouting and straining the lungs to the utmost?"" No; the natural thing is that it be aroused to such a pitch by easy stages, just as persons who are wrangling begin with ordinary conversational tones and then pass to shouting at the top of their lungs. No speaker cries ""Help me, citizens!"" at the outset of his speech. 8. Therefore, whenever your spirit's impulse prompts you, raise a hubbub, now in louder now in milder tones, according as your voice, as well as your spirit, shall suggest to you, when you are moved to such a performance. Then let your voice, when you rein it in and call it back to earth, come down gently, not collapse; it should trail off in tones half way between high and low, and should not abruptly drop from its raving in the uncouth manner of countrymen. For our purpose is, not to give the voice exercise, but to make it give us exercise.

9 You see, I have relieved you of no slight bother; and I shall throw in a little complementary present, - it is Greek, too. Here is the proverb; it is an excellent one: ""The fool's life is empty of gratitude and full of fears; its course lies wholly toward the future."" ""Who uttered these words?"" you say. The same writer whom I mentioned before.**[5]** And what sort of life do you think is meant by the fool's life? That of Baba and Isio?**[6]** No; he means our own, for we are plunged by our blind desires into ventures which will harm us, but certainly will never satisfy us; for if we could be satisfied with anything, we should have been satisfied long ago; nor do we reflect how pleasant it is to demand nothing, how noble it is to be contented and not to be dependent upon Fortune. 10. Therefore continually remind yourself, Lucilius, how many ambitions you have attained. When you see many ahead of you, think how many are behind! If you would thank the gods, and be grateful for your past life, you should contemplate how many men you have outstripped. But what have you to do with the others? You have outstripped yourself.

11 Fix a limit which you will not even desire to pass, should you have the power. At last, then, away with all these treacherous goods! They look better to those who hope for them than to those who have attained them. If there were anything substantial in them, they would sooner or later satisfy you; as it is, they merely rouse the drinkers' thirst. Away with fripperies which only serve for show! As to what the future's uncertain lot has in store, why should I demand of Fortune that she give rather than demand of myself that I should not crave? And why should l crave? Shall I heap up my winnings, and forget that man's lot is unsubstantial? For what end should I toil? Lo, to-day is the last; if not, it is near the last. Farewell.

I say, crowds; for as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety. I shall admit my own weakness, at any rate; for I never bring back home the same character that I took abroad with me. Something of that which I have forced to be calm within me is disturbed; some of the foes that I have routed return again. Just as the sick man, who has been weak for a long time, is in such a condition that he cannot be taken out of the house without suffering a relapse, so we ourselves are affected when our souls are recovering from a lingering disease. 2 To consort with the crowd is harmful; there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously therewith. Certainly, the greater the mob with which we mingle, the greater the danger.

But nothing is so damaging to good character as the habit of lounging at the games; for then it is that vice steals subtly upon one through the avenue of pleasure. 3 What do you think I mean? I mean that I come home more greedy, more ambitious, more voluptuous, and even more cruel and inhuman, because I have been among human beings. By chance I attended a mid-day exhibition, expecting some fun, wit, and relaxation, - an exhibition at which men's eyes have respite from the slaughter of their fellow-men. But it was quite the reverse. The previous combats were the essence of compassion; but now all the trifling is put aside and it is pure murder.**[1]** The men have no defensive armour. They are exposed to blows at all points, and no one ever strikes in vain. 4 Many persons prefer this programme to the usual pairs and to the bouts ""by request."" Of course they do; there is no helmet or shield to deflect the weapon. What is the need of defensive armour, or of skill? All these mean delaying death. In the morning they throw men to the lions and the bears; at noon, they throw them to the spectators. The spectators demand that the slayer shall face the man who is to slay him in his turn; and they always reserve the latest conqueror for another butchering. The outcome of every fight is death, and the means are fire and sword. This sort of thing goes on while the arena is empty. 5 You may retort: ""But he was a highway robber; he killed a man!"" And what of it? Granted that, as a murderer, he deserved this punishment, what crime have you committed, poor fellow, that you should deserve to sit and see this show? In the morning they cried ""Kill him! Lash him! Burn him! Why does he meet the sword in so cowardly a way? Why does he strike so feebly? Why doesn't he die game? Whip him to meet his wounds! Let them receive blow for blow, with chests bare and exposed to the stroke!"" And when the games stop for the intermission, they announce: ""A little throatcutting in the meantime, so that there may still be something going on!""

Come now; do you**[2]** not understand even this truth, that a bad example reacts on the agent? Thank the immortal gods that you are teaching cruelty to a person who cannot learn to be cruel. 6 The young character, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued from the mob; it is too easy to side with the majority. Even Socrates, Cato, and Laelius might have been shaken in their moral strength by a crowd that was unlike them; so true it is that none of us, no matter how much he cultivates his abilities, can withstand the shock of faults that approach, as it were, with so great a retinue. 7 Much harm is done by a single case of indulgence or greed; the familiar friend, if he be luxurious, weakens and softens us imperceptibly; the neighbour, if he be rich, rouses our covetousness; the companion, if he be slanderous, rubs off some of his rust upon us, even though we be spotless and sincere. What then do you think the effect will be on character, when the world at large assaults it! You must either imitate or loathe the world.

8 But both courses are to be avoided; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you. Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach. 9 There is no reason why pride in advertising your abilities should lure you into publicity, so that you should desire to recite or harangue before the general public. Of course I should be willing for you to do so if you had a stock-in-trade that suited such a mob; as it is, there is not a man of them who can understand you. One or two individuals will perhaps come in your way, but even these will have to be moulded and trained by you so that they will understand you. You may say: ""For what purpose did I learn all these things?"" But you need not fear that you have wasted your efforts; it was for yourself that you learned them.

10 In order, however, that I may not to-day have learned exclusively for myself, I shall share with you three excellent sayings, of the same general purport, which have come to my attention. This letter will give you one of them as payment of my debt; the other two you may accept as a contribution in advance. Democritus**[3]** says: ""One man means as much to me as a multitude, and a multitude only as much as one man."" 11 The following also was nobly spoken by someone or other, for it is doubtful who the author was; they asked him what was the object of all this study applied to an art that would reach but very few. He replied: ""I am content with few, content with one, content with none at all."" The third saying - and a noteworthy one, too - is by Epicurus,**[4]** written to one of the partners of his studies: ""I write this not for the many, but for you; each of us is enough of an audience for the other."" 12 Lay these words to heart, Lucilius, that you may scorn the pleasure which comes from the applause of the majority. Many men praise you; but have you any reason for being pleased with yourself, if you are a person whom the many can understand? Your good qualities should face inwards. Farewell.

1351563153.0,16,self.Stoicism,12bdcj,Questions about Stoicism. [Warning: Much reading.] (Cross-post from /r/askphilosophy and /r/philosophy.),JayWalken,16,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/12bdcj/questions_about_stoicism_warning_much_reading/,"Hey, /r/Stoicism. Recently, I became interested in [Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) and read [Epictetus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus)' [Discourses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_of_Epictetus) and [Enchiridion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchiridion_of_Epictetus) and am currently reading The Golden Sayings of Epictetus.

Epictetus has said the following:

* ""Freedom is secured not by the fulfilling of men's desires, but by the removal of desire.""

* ""Where is the good? In the will. Where is the evil? In the will. Where is neither of them? In those things that are independent of the will.""

* ""Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them."" (My preferred version: ""Man is troubled not by events, but by the meaning he gives them."")

However, has Epictetus said how a man is to remove his desire? Has he said how a man can cease to concern himself with what is ""independent of the will"" or how to alter his views (cease to by troubled by) on ""things"" (""events"")? If so, I am unaware.

Epictetus seems to think that the above can be achieved either by repeating the bullet-pointed quotes as maxims when appropriate or, as a result of the quotes, for a man to think the following (when appropriate):

* ""I desire X, therefore, I must cease to desire X in order to be free (from suffering).""

* ""X is independent of the will, therefore, X does not concern me.""

* ""My opinion about X is disturbing me, not X itself, therefore, I must cease to be of this opinion.""

However, oneself acknowledging that one must cease to desire X does not necessitate one ceasing to desire X. Nor does acknowledging that X does not concern oneself necessitate one no longer concerning himself with X. Nor does acknowledging that one is perturbed by one's opinion about X necessitate one ceasing to be of that opinion. An acknowledgement of the above or a repetition of maxims seems to me like a futile attempt at achieving the above. Epictetus, though, seems to me to think that a psychological revolution is to occur as a result of repeating maxims. I am very willing to admit that what seems to me is mistaken.

Then I heard the story of [Zeno of Citium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium) and it provided a possible alternative. From Wikipedia:

""Zeno was a merchant and that after surviving a shipwreck, Zeno wandered into a bookshop in Athens and was attracted to some writings about Socrates. He asked the librarian how to find such a man. In response, the librarian pointed to [Crates of Thebes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crates_of_Thebes), the most famous [Cynic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy\)) living at that time in Greece... In one incident during his tutelage with Crates, he was made to carry a pot of lentil soup around the city. After Zeno began carrying the pot, Crates smashed it with his staff, splattering the lentil soup all over his surprised student. When Zeno began to run off in embarrassment, Crates chided, ""Why run away, my little Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen you!""

The possible alternative is that what is to be achieved is to be achieved through practice, however, I have difficulty applying practice to the cessation of desire, and of opinion, and of becoming indifferent to what is independent of the will. Perhaps you, /r/Stoicism, may know how this can be done.

Perhaps what is to be achieved is to be achieved via a compromise between, or synthesis, of, the first possibility, the theoretical, and the second, the practical, and that Epictetus thinks that what is to be achieved can be achieved through mental exercises. However, again, I have difficulty fathoming such exercises. Although, again, perhaps you, /r/Stoicism, may know of some.

So, /r/Stoicism, might you share with me how you think, according to Epictetus, a man is to remove his desire, cease to concern himself with what is ""independent of the will"" and how he is to alter his views? A critique or expansion of the possibilities I have provided is very much appreciated (all contributions are very much appreciated), and your own possibilities are, too.

I am a Shakespearean by trade and am rereading *Measure for Measure*. I've always had a keen eye for the philosophy that Shakespeare inserted into his lines and, although it's difficult ever to say that this or that is to be taken only one way (literary interpretation makes argument rule rather than fact), I thought this scene was a very interesting summation of an early modern resolve against the specter of death.

In prison, awaiting execution, Claudio is visited by the Duke disguised as a friar. The Duke will, in the end, pardon Claudio but nonetheless Claudio is facing his imminent death in a very real sense. When Claudio says that he is sure that he will die but nonetheless clings to hope that he will be spared, the Duke/friar gives the following monologue:
___________________
**DUKE:**
Be absolute for death; either death or life     [5]

Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:

If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing

That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,

Servile to all the skyey influences,

That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,     [10]

Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;

For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun

And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;

For all the accommodations that thou bear'st

Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;     [15]

For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork

Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,

And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st

Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;

For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains     [20]

That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;

For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,

And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;

For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,

After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;     [25]

For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,

Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,

And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;

For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,

The mere effusion of thy proper loins,     [30]

Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,

For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,

But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,

Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth

Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms     [35]

Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,

Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,

To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this

That bears the name of life? Yet in this life

Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,     [40]

That makes these odds all even.


**CLAUDIO:**
I humbly thank you.

To sue to live, I find I seek to die;

And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

1334532053.0,15,self.Stoicism,sbgxk,what living according to nature meant to a classical stoic,cleomedes,16,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/sbgxk/what_living_according_to_nature_meant_to_a/,"In past conversations here, there has been some confusion about what ""living according to nature"" means.

From 'Stoicism' by St. George William Joseph Stock:

&gt; It was assumed by the Greeks that the ways of nature were 'the ways of pleasantness,' and that 'all her paths' were 'peace.' This may seem to us a startling assumption, but that is because we do not mean by 'nature' the same thing as they did. We connect the term with the origin of a thing, they connected it rather with the end; by the 'natural state' we mean a state of savagery, they meant the highest civilization; we mean by a thing's nature what it is or has been, they meant what it ought to become under the most favorable conditions: not the sour crab, but the mellow glory of the Herperides, worthy to be guarded by a sleepless dragon, was to the Greeks the natural apple. Hence we find Aristotle maintaining that the State is a natural product, because it is evolved out of social relations which exist by nature. Nature indeed was a highly ambiguous term to the Greeks no less than ourselves, but in the sense with which we are now concerned the nature of anything as defined by the Peripatetics as 'the end of its becoming.' Another definition of theirs puts the matter still more clearly: What each thing is when its growth has been completed, that we declare to be the nature of each thing.

This fits nicely with the classical stoic's teleological physics, but perhaps less so with our modern mechanistic science. (See [here](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/01/17/dysteleological-physicalism/) for more on teleology.) One needs to be a little careful here, because classical stoicism's purely materialist teleology is rather different from the dualist teleology held by many Christians. While (the modern version of) the later seems to see the cosmos like a game of billiards being played by God, following mechanistic rules except for occasional strikes with the queue stick (miracles), such a model doesn't seem compatible with my understanding of the stoic version. The classical stoics were pantheists. Diogenes Laertius reports that stoics thought that the cosmos was an animal, rational and alive and intelligent and capable of sense-perception (*The Stoics Reader* p. 54). Cicero's account of stoicism states ""the nature of the cosmos has all the voluntary motions, endeavors, and impulses... and carries out the actions consequent on them, just as we ourselves do who are set in motion by our minds and senses"" (*The Stoics Reader,*  p. 68) Modern neostoics do not usually share this view.

Lawrence Becker's *New Stoicism* redefines living according to nature as living according to the facts, but it appears to me that something remeniscent of the original creeps in as part of his use of developmental psychology in deriving practical virtues from his rather abstact axioms.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,True,,,True,t3_sbgxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/sbgxk/what_living_according_to_nature_meant_to_a/,

Stoicism provides me with the idea that I can not only bare misfortune and negative feelings, but overcome them by direct confrontation; that through conscious will and commitment I can choose to live well. The notion of emotional projecting or sweeping my problems under the rug seems disgustingly wimpy to me, it breeds a character of whiny victimhood that I do not wish to relate to. 

Stoicism not only promotes living well but also rejects the ascetic lifestyle, a lifestyle that I find to be uncourageous. It allows me to help deal with my need to be both reflective and social active in a way befitting to a decent morally conscious individual (that I wish to be).

Other attractions:

It combines prudence with personal liveliness (Stoic joy) and hormetic values without masochism.

""What kind of ill-health?"" you say. And you surely have a right to ask; for it is true that no kind is unknown to me. But I have been consigned, so to speak, to one special ailment. I do not know why I should call it by its Greek name;**[1]** for it is well enough described as ""shortness of breath."" Its attack is of very brief duration, like that of a squall at sea; it usually ends within an hour. Who indeed could breathe his last for long? 

2 I have passed through all the ills and dangers of the flesh; but nothing seems to me more troublesome than this. And naturally so; for anything else may be called illness; but this is a sort of continued ""last gasp.""**[2]** Hence physicians call it ""practising how to die."" For some day the breath will succeed in doing what it has so often essayed. 

3 Do you think I am writing this letter in a merry spirit, just because I have escaped? It would be absurd to take delight in such supposed restoration to health, as it would be for a defendant to imagine that he had won his case when he had succeeded in postponing his trial. Yet in the midst of my difficult breathing I never ceased to rest secure in cheerful and brave thoughts.

4 ""What?"" I say to myself; ""does death so often test me? Let it do so; I myself have for a long time tested death."" ""When?"" you ask. Before I was born. Death is non-existence, and I know already what that means. What was before me will happen again after me. If there is any suffering in this state, there must have been such suffering also in the past, before we entered the light of day. As a matter of fact, however, we felt no discomfort then. 

5 And I ask you, would you not say that one was the greatest of fools who believed that a lamp was worse off when it was extinguished than before it was lighted? We mortals also are lighted and extinguished; the period of suffering comes in between, but on either side there is a deep peace. For, unless I am very much mistaken, my dear Lucilius, we go astray in thinking that death only follows, when in reality it has both preceded us and will in turn follow us. Whatever condition existed before our birth, is death. For what does it matter whether you do not begin at all, or whether you leave off, inasmuch as the result of both these states is non-existence?

6 I have never ceased to encourage myself with cheering counsels of this kind, silently, of course, since I had not the power to speak; then little by little this shortness of breath, already reduced to a sort of panting, came on at greater intervals, and then slowed down and finally stopped. Even by this time, although the gasping has ceased, the breath does not come and go normally; I still feel a sort of hesitation and delay in breathing. Let it be as it pleases, provided there be no sigh from the soul.**[3]**

7 Accept this assurance from me – I shall never be frightened when the last hour comes; I am already prepared and do not plan a whole day ahead. But do you praise**[4]** and imitate the man whom it does not irk to die, though he takes pleasure in living. For what virtue is there in going away when you are thrust out? And yet there is virtue even in this: I am indeed thrust out, but it is as if I were going away willingly. For that reason the wise man can never be thrust out, because that would mean removal from a place which he was unwilling to leave; and the wise man does nothing unwillingly. He escapes necessity, because he wills to do what necessity is about to force upon him. Farewell.

If I remember correctly, it's said that a Stoic sage may fall in love, but it's not recommended for us insane people (that is to say, non-sages). I directly disobeyed this principle.

Suffice it to say that my fiance has left me, and with all my life plans up in the air, alcohol has been my best friend. I've been an addict for about three years on various drugs, and in the next two weeks (after the semester shift) I'll be locking myself in my room to meditate and get sober. Mr. Aurelius has been my guide for this decision, and I hope the quote I've posted on my whiteboard will help me through the next few weeks;

""Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how after a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by the gods, thou hast neglected it. It is high time for thee to understand the true nature both of the world, whereof thou art a part, and of that lord and governor of the world, from whom, as a channel from the spring, thou thyself didst flow, and that there is but a certain limit of time appointed to thee, which if thou shalt not make use of to calm and allay the many distempers of your soul, it will pass away, and thou with it, and never after return.""

I've found a lot of truth in this quote, which is found in some translations of Aurelius' Meditations as the first verse of book two. ""...having been set unto thee by the gods, thou hast neglected it"" rings very close to the heart as an addict. I've wasted about three years of my life so far neglecting my Dharma, as our Hindi friends would say. But it feels more like I've neglected my life itself, and the time I've been 'given'.

Realizing that other bodies and people, as externals, are outside of my control and therefore not worth worrying about has helped me a lot throughout this breakup. But honestly, I've mostly been drinking to forget, and numbing myself so I can get through finals with some fake sanity.

So I'm asking the community of /r/Stoicism for quotes, thoughts, sources, books, ideas, anything to help me fight the reality that is coming for me in the second week of May. I won't have a shoulder to lean on, nor a friend to tell, and not even the mercy of 100 proof vodka to confide in. I'll only have my infinite mind and a little time to work through everything.

Thank you all for your support, and I thank Zeus everyday for /r/Stoicism and all the ideas I've found here.

Hays:
&gt;MY FIRST TEACHER: Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or that in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do my own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers.

Robin Hard:
&gt;From my tutor, not to have sided with the Greens or the Blues at the races, or the fighters with the light shields or the heavy in the amphitheater; to endure hardship, and have few needs; to do things for myself and not meddle in the affairs of others; and to turn a deaf ear to slander.

Hutchinson &amp; Moor ([available online pdf](http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2133/Aurelius_1464_LFeBk.pdf)):
&gt;He who had the charge of my education, taught me not to be fondly
attached to any of the contending parties in the chariot-races, or in the combats of the gladiators. He taught me also to endure labour; not to need many things; to serve myself, without troubling others; not to intermeddle with the affairs of others, and not easily to admit of accusations against them.

Indeed, have you already advised yourself, already corrected your own faults? Is this the reason why you have leisure to reform other men?"" No, I am not so shameless as to undertake to cure my fellow-men when I am ill myself. I am, however, discussing with you troubles which concern us both, and sharing the remedy with you, just as if we were lying ill in the same hospital. Listen to me, therefore, as you would if I were talking to myself. I am admitting you to my inmost thoughts, and am having it out with myself, merely making use of you as my pretext. 2. I keep crying out to myself: ""Count your years, and you will be ashamed to desire and pursue the same things you desired in your boyhood days. Of this one thing make sure against your dying day, – let your faults die before you die. Away with those disordered pleasures, which must be dearly paid for; it is not only those which are to come that harm me, but also those which have come and gone. Just as crimes, even if they have not been detected when they were committed, do not allow anxiety to end with them; so with guilty pleasures, regret remains even after the pleasures are over. They are not substantial, they are not trustworthy; even if they do not harm us, they are fleeting. 3. Cast about rather for some good which will abide. But there can be no such good except as the soul discovers it for itself within itself. Virtue alone affords everlasting and peace-giving joy; even if some obstacle arise, it is but like an intervening cloud, which floats beneath the sun but never prevails against it.""

4 When will it be your lot to attain this joy? Thus far, you have indeed not been sluggish, but you must quicken your pace. Much toil remains; to confront it, you must yourself lavish all your waking hours, and all your efforts, if you wish the result to be accomplished. This matter cannot be delegated to someone else. 5. The other kind of literary activity**[1]** admits of outside assistance. Within our own time there was a certain rich man named Calvisius Sabinus; he had the bank-account and the brains of a freedman. **[2]** I never saw a man whose good fortune was a greater offence against propriety. His memory was so faulty that he would sometimes forget the name of Ulysses, or Achilles, or Priam, – names which we know as well as we know those of our own attendants. No major-domo in his dotage, who cannot give men their right names, but is compelled to invent names for them, – no such man, I say, calls off the names**[3]** of his master's tribesmen so atrociously as Sabinus used to call off the Trojan and Achaean heroes. But none the less did he desire to appear learned. 6. So he devised this short cut to learning: he paid fabulous prices for slaves, – one to know Homer by heart and another to know Hesiod; he also delegated a special slave to each of the nine lyric poets. You need not wonder that he paid high prices for these slaves; if he did not find them ready to hand he had them made to order. After collecting this retinue, he began to make life miserable for his guests; he would keep these fellows at the foot of his couch, and ask them from time to time for verses which he might repeat, and then frequently break down in the middle of a word. 7. Satellius Quadratus, a feeder, and consequently a fawner, upon addle-pated millionaires, and also (for this quality goes with the other two) a flouter of them, suggested to Sabinus that he should have philologists to gather up the bits.**[4]** Sabinus remarked that each slave cost him one hundred thousand sesterces; Satellius replied: ""You might have bought as many book-cases for a smaller sum."" But Sabinus held to the opinion that what any member of his household knew, he himself knew also. 8. This same Satellius began to advise Sabinus to take wrestling lessons, – sickly, pale, and thin as he was, Sabinus answered: ""How can I? I can scarcely stay alive now."" ""Don't say that, I implore you,"" replied the other, ""consider how many perfectly healthy slaves you have!"" No man is able to borrow or buy a sound mind; in fact, as it seems to me, even though sound minds were for sale, they would not find buyers. Depraved minds, however, are bought and sold every day.

9 But let me pay off my debt and say farewell: ""Real wealth is poverty adjusted to the law of Nature.""**[5]** Epicurus has this saying in various ways and contexts; but it can never be repeated too often, since it can never be learned too well. For some persons the remedy should be merely prescribed; in the case of others, it should be forced down their throats. Farewell.

1357583882.0,15,self.Stoicism,164ria,"On the True Joy which Comes from Philosophy - Seneca, Letter 23",ThatsOK,19,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/164ria/on_the_true_joy_which_comes_from_philosophy/,"1 Do you suppose that I shall write you how kindly the winter season has dealt with us, – a short season and a mild one, – or what a nasty spring we are having, – cold weather out of season, – and all the other trivialities which people write when they are at a loss for topics of conversation? No; I shall communicate something which may help both you and myself. And what shall this ""something"" be, if not an exhortation to soundness of mind? Do you ask what is the foundation of a sound mind? It is, not to find joy in useless things. I said that it was the foundation; it is really the pinnacle. 2. We have reached the heights if we know what it is that we find joy in and if we have not placed our happiness in the control of externals. The man who is goaded ahead by hope of anything, though it be within reach, though it be easy of access, and though his ambitions have never played him false, is troubled and unsure of himself. 3. Above all, my dear Lucilius, make this your business: learn how to feel joy.

Do you think that I am now robbing you of many pleasures when I try to do away with the gifts of chance, when I counsel the avoidance of hope, the sweetest thing that gladdens our hearts? Quite the contrary; I do not wish you ever to be deprived of gladness. I would have it born in your house; and it is born there, if only it be inside of you. Other objects of cheer do not fill a man's bosom; they merely smooth his brow and are inconstant, – unless perhaps you believe that he who laughs has joy. The very soul must be happy and confident, lifted above every circumstance.

4 Real joy, believe me, is a stern matter. Can one, do you think, despise death with a care-free countenance, or with a ""blithe and gay"" expression, as our young dandies are accustomed to say? Or can one thus open his door to poverty, or hold the curb on his pleasures, or contemplate the endurance of pain? He who ponders these things**[1]** in his heart is indeed full of joy; but it is not a cheerful joy. It is just this joy, however, of which I would have you become the owner; for it will never fail you when once you have found its source. 5. The yield of poor mines is on the surface; those are really rich whose veins lurk deep, and they will make more bountiful returns to him who delves unceasingly. So too those baubles which delight the common crowd afford but a thin pleasure, laid on as a coating, and even joy that is only plated lacks a real basis. But the joy of which I speak, that to which I am endeavouring to lead you, is something solid, disclosing itself the more fully as you penetrate into it. 6. Therefore I pray you, my dearest Lucilius, do the one thing that can render you really happy: cast aside and trample under foot all the things that glitter outwardly and are held out to you**[2]** by another or as obtainable from another; look toward the true good, and rejoice only in that which comes from your own store. And what do I mean by ""from your own store""? I mean from your very self, that which is the best part of you. The frail body, also, even though we can accomplish nothing without it, is to be regarded as necessary rather than as important; it involves us in vain pleasures, short-lived, and soon to be regretted, which, unless they are reined in by extreme self-control, will be transformed into the opposite. This is what I mean: pleasure, unless it has been kept within bounds, tends to rush headlong into the abyss of sorrow.

But it is hard to keep within bounds in that which you believe to be good. The real good may be coveted with safety. 7. Do you ask me what this real good is, and whence it derives? I will tell you: it comes from a good conscience, from honourable purposes, from right actions, from contempt of the gifts of chance, from an even and calm way of living which treads but one path. For men who leap from one purpose to another, or do not even leap but are carried over by a sort of hazard, – how can such wavering and unstable persons possess any good that is fixed and lasting? 8. There are only a few who control themselves and their affairs by a guiding purpose; the rest do not proceed; they are merely swept along, like objects afloat in a river. And of these objects, some are held back by sluggish waters and are transported gently; others are torn along by a more violent current; some, which are nearest the bank, are left there as the current slackens; and others are carried out to sea by the onrush of the stream. Therefore, we should decide what we wish, and abide by the decision.

9 Now is the time for me to pay my debt. I can give you a saying of your friend Epicurus**[3]** and thus clear this letter of its obligation. ""It is bothersome always to be beginning life."" Or another, which will perhaps express the meaning better: ""They live ill who are always beginning to live."" 10. You are right in asking why; the saying certainly stands in need of a commentary. It is because the life of such persons is always incomplete. But a man cannot stand prepared for the approach of death if he has just begun to live. We must make it our aim already to have lived long enough. No one deems that he has done so, if he is just on the point of planning his life. 11. You need not think that there are few of this kind; practically everyone is of such a stamp. Some men, indeed, only begin to live when it is time for them to leave off living. And if this seems surprising to you, I shall add that which will surprise you still more: Some men have left off living before they have begun. Farewell.

"" When a philosopher,"" he said, ""is exhorting, persuading, rebuking, or discussing some aspect of philosophy, if the audience pour forth trite and commonplace words of praise in their enthusiasm and unrestraint, if they even shout, if they gesticulate, if they are moved and aroused, and swayed by the charm of his words, by the rhythm of his phrases, and by certain rhetorical repetitions, then you may know that both the speaker and his audience are wasting their time, and that they are not hearing a philosopher speaking but a fluteplayer performing. The mind,"" he said, ""of a man who is listening to a philosopher, if the things which are said are useful and helpful and furnish remedies for faults and errors, has no leisure and time for profuse and extravagant praise. The hearer, whoever he may be, unless he has completely lost his moral sense, in listening to the philosopher's words must shudder and feel secretly ashamed and repentant, and again experience joy and wonder and even have varying facial expressions and changes of feeling as the philosopher's speech affects him and touches his recognition of that part of his soul which is sound and that which is sick.

Moreover, he used to say that great applause and admiration are to be sure not unrelated, but that the greatest admiration yields silence rather than words. For that reason he said the wisest of poets does not have those who listened to Ulysses relating the wonderful tale of his hardships leap up and shout and cry out their approval when he finished speaking, but he says that all kept silent as if struck dumb and senseless because the pleasure they had in hearing him affected their power of speech. 

""Thus he spoke; but they all were hushed and silent And were held spellbound throughout the shadowy halls.""[1]

Comments?",deeptempotic,16,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1czg20/goes_against_the_stoic_view_of_nature_but_it/,"I think the Stoics had it right by appealing to virtue, but Epictetus' dictum to ""live according to nature"" always had me a bit baffled. Maybe others here feel (or have felt) the same way.

That said, I ran across the following quote today. It's a blurb from an essay entitled ""The Perfectionist"" by Margaret Talbot, her essay appearing as a selection in a 1999 collection of essays edited by Phillip Lopate called ""The Essay."" Talbot's ""The Perfectionist"" does not address Stoicism whatsoever, yet when I read the following I could not help but think of it:

""For there is nothing moral in nature--nothing, that is, that we have not ascribed to it. There is beauty in nature, beauty unbounded, but there is no justice and there is no mercy. 'Either it is right that we should kill because nature kills,"" [John Stuart?] Mill wrote in his great essay on nature, 'torture because it tortures; ruin and devastate because nature does the like; or we ought not to consider at all what nature does, but what it is good to do'"" (pg. 22).  

Well, yeah! Epictetus does this, appealing to his students about how they should act, how they should do what is good, put their thoughts on the scale--and then he invokes NATURE!

Perhaps this is entirely an issue that is lost in translation and time. Perhaps it has a lot to do with how the Greeks/Romans viewed nature as being influenced by the gods.

What do you guys think about the quote above? How can we live according to nature--and live correctly/properly--if we are the ones that apply morals and views to it? How do we use it as an example, as Epictetus suggests? Feel free to comment. Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_1czg20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1czg20/goes_against_the_stoic_view_of_nature_but_it/,
1363629247.0,14,self.Stoicism,1ajb83,How reason has the faculty of taking cognizance of itself - Epictetus,ThatsOK,15,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1ajb83/how_reason_has_the_faculty_of_taking_cognizance/,"Every art and faculty has certain principal things of which it is to take cognizance. When therefore the faculty itself is of like kind with the objects of which it takes cognizance, it must of necessity have power to take cognizance of itself: when it is of unlike kind, it cannot take cognizance of itself. For instance, the shoemaker's art is concerned with hides, but itself is absolutely different from the material of hides: for this reason it does not take cognizance of itself. Grammar again is concerned with written speech: is it then written speech itself? Certainly not: therefore it cannot take cognizance of itself.

For what purpose then have we received reason from nature? That we may deal with impressions aright.

What then is reason itself?

A system framed from impressions of a certain kind. Thus it naturally has the power to take cognizance of itself.

Again, sagacity has been given us. To take cognizance of what? Things good and bad and indifferent.

What is it then itself?

Good.

And what is folly?

Bad. Do you see then that of necessity sagacity has the power of taking cognizance of itself and its opposite? Therefore the primary and highest task of the philosopher is to test impressions and distinguish them and to make use of none which is untested. Consider how we have invented an art to test the currency, in which we are admitted to have some interest. Look how many means the assayer uses to test the coin —sight, touch, smell, finally hearing: he breaks the penny and attends to the sound, and is not content with hearing its note once, but by much attention gets an ear for music.

Thus, where we think it makes a serious difference to us whether we are right or wrong, we take great pains to distinguish the possible sources of error, and yet when we have to do with our Governing Principle itself, poor thing, we gape and sleep and are ready to accept any impression that comes: for we do not notice our loss.

When you wish, therefore, to realize how little concerned you are about good and evil, and how eager about things indifferent, consider how you regard physical blindness on the one hand, and mental delusion on the other, and you will recognize that you are far from having a proper feeling in regard to things good and evil.

'Yes, but it needs much preparation and much toil and study.'

What of that? Do you expect that a brief study will enable you to acquire the greatest art? Yet the principal doctrine of philosophers itself is brief enough. If you will learn it, read Zeno's words and you will see. For it is no long matter to say man's end is to follow the gods, and the essence of good is the power of dealing rightly with impressions.

'Tell us then what is ""God,"" and what is ""impression,"" and what is nature in the individual, and what in the universe'.

That is a long story.

Again, if Epicurus should come and say, that the good must be in the flesh, that too means a long discussion; it means we must be taught what is the commanding faculty in us, what constitutes our substantial and true nature. If it is not probable that the good of the snail is in the shell, is it probable that man's good is in his body? Take yourself, Epicurus. What is the more masterful faculty you possess? What is it in you which deliberates, which examines everything, which examines the flesh itself and decides that it is the principal thing? Why do you light a lamp and toil for us, and write such big volumes? Is it that we may not be ignorant of the truth? Who are we? What concern have we with you? So the argument becomes a long one.

1361813908.0,14,self.Stoicism,1979rl,"On the Futility of Learning Maxims - Seneca, Letter 33",ThatsOK,18,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1979rl/on_the_futility_of_learning_maxims_seneca_letter/,"1 You wish me to close these letters also, as I closed my former letters, with certain utterances taken from the chiefs of our school. But they did not interest themselves in choice extracts; the whole texture of their work is full of strength. There is unevenness, you know, when some objects rise conspicuous above others. A single tree is not remarkable if the whole forest rises to the same height. 2. Poetry is crammed with utterances of this sort, and so is history. For this reason I would not have you think that these utterances belong to Epicurus. they are common property and are emphatically our own.**[1]** They are, however, more noteworthy in Epicurus, because they appear at infrequent intervals and when you do not expect them, and because it is surprising that brave words should be spoken at any time by a man who made a practice of being effeminate. For that is what most persons maintain. In my own opinion, however, Epicurus is really a brave man, even though he did wear long sleeves.**[2]** Fortitude, energy, and readiness for battle are to be found among the Persians,**[3]** just as much as among men who have girded themselves up high.

3 Therefore, you need not call upon me for extracts and quotations; such thoughts as one may extract here and there in the works of other philosophers run through the whole body of our writings. Hence we have no ""show-window goods,"" nor do we deceive the purchaser in such a way that, if he enters our shop, he will find nothing except that which is displayed in the window. We allow the purchasers themselves to get their samples from anywhere they please. 4. Suppose we should desire to sort out each separate motto from the general stock; to whom shall we credit them? To Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Panaetius, or Posidonius? We Stoics are not subjects of a despot: each of us lays claim to his own freedom. With them,**[4]** on the other hand, whatever Hermarchus says or Metrodorus, is ascribed to one source. In that brotherhood, everything that any man utters is spoken under the leadership and commanding authority **[5]** of one alone. We cannot, I maintain, no matter how we try, pick out anything from so great a multitude of things equally good.

*Only the poor man counts his flock*.

**[6]**

Wherever you direct your gaze, you will meet with something that might stand out from the rest, if the context in which you read it were not equally notable.

5 For this reason, give over hoping that you can skim, by means of epitomes, the wisdom of distinguished men. Look into their wisdom as a whole; study it as a whole. They are working out a plan and weaving together, line upon line, a masterpiece, from which nothing can be taken away without injury to the whole. Examine the separate parts, if you like, provided you examine them as parts of the man himself. She is not a beautiful woman whose ankle or arm is praised, but she whose general appearance makes you forget to admire her single attributes.

6 If you insist, however, I shall not be niggardly with you, but lavish; for there is a huge multitude of these passages; they are scattered about in profusion, – they do not need to be gathered together, but merely to be picked up. They do not drip forth occasionally; they flow continuously. They are unbroken and are closely connected. Doubtless they would be of much benefit to those who are still novices and worshipping outside the shrine; for single maxims sink in more easily when they are marked off and bounded like a line of verse. 7. That is why we give to children a proverb, or that which the Greeks call Chria,**[7]** to be learned by heart; that sort of thing can be comprehended by the young mind, which cannot as yet hold more. For a man, however, whose progress is definite, to chase after choice extracts and to prop his weakness by the best known and the briefest sayings and to depend upon his memory, is disgraceful; it is time for him to lean on himself. He should make such maxims and not memorize them. For it is disgraceful even for an old man, or one who has sighted old age, to have a note-book knowledge. ""This is what Zeno said."" But what have you yourself said? ""This is the opinion of Cleanthes."" But what is your own opinion? How long shall you march under another man's orders? Take command, and utter some word which posterity will remember. Put forth something from your own stock. 8. For this reason I hold that there is nothing of eminence in all such men as these, who never create anything themselves, but always lurk in the shadow of others, playing the rôle of interpreters, never daring to put once into practice what they have been so long in learning. They have exercised their memories on other men's material. But it is one thing to remember, another to know. Remembering is merely safeguarding something entrusted to the memory; knowing, however, means making everything your own; it means not depending upon the copy and not all the time glancing back at the master. 9. ""Thus said Zeno, thus said Cleanthes, indeed!"" Let there be a difference between yourself and your book! How long shall you be a learner? From now on be a teacher as well! ""But why,"" one asks,**[8]** ""should I have to continue hearing lectures on what I can read?"" ""The living voice,"" one replies, ""is a great help."" Perhaps, but not the voice which merely makes itself the mouthpiece of another's words, and only performs the duty of a reporter.

10 Consider this fact also. Those who have never attained their mental independence begin, in the first place, by following the leader in cases where everyone has deserted the leader; then, in the second place, they follow him in matters where the truth is still being investigated. However, the truth will never be discovered if we rest contented with discoveries already made. Besides, he who follows another not only discovers nothing but is not even investigating. 11. What then? Shall I not follow in the footsteps of my predecessors? I shall indeed use the old road, but if I find one that makes a shorter cut and is smoother to travel, I shall open the new road. Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters, but our guides. Truth lies open for all; it has not yet been monopolized. And there is plenty of it left even for posterity to discover. Farewell.

1 You write me that you are anxious about the result of a lawsuit, with which an angry opponent is threatening you; and you expect me to advise you to picture to yourself a happier issue, and to rest in the allurements of hope. Why, indeed, is it necessary to summon trouble, – which must be endured soon enough when it has once arrived, or to anticipate trouble and ruin the present through fear of the future? It is indeed foolish to be unhappy now because you may be unhappy at some future time. 2. But I shall conduct you to peace of mind by another route: if you would put off all worry, assume that what you fear may happen will certainly happen in any event; whatever the trouble may be, measure it in your own mind, and estimate the amount of your fear. You will thus understand that what you fear is either insignificant or short-lived. 3. And you need not spend a long time in gathering illustrations which will strengthen you; every epoch has produced them. Let your thoughts travel into any era of Roman or foreign history, and there will throng before you notable examples of high achievement or of high endeavour.

If you lose this case, can anything more severe happen to you than being sent into exile or led to prison? Is there a worse fate that any man may fear than being burned or being killed? Name such penalties one by one, and mention the men who have scorned them; one does not need to hunt for them, – it is simply a matter of selection. 4. Sentence of conviction was borne by Rutilius as if the injustice of the decision were the only thing which annoyed him. Exile was endured by Metellus with courage, by Rutilius even with gladness; for the former consented to come back only because his country called him; the latter refused to return when Sulla summoned him, – and nobody in those days said ""No"" to Sulla! Socrates in prison discoursed, and declined to flee when certain persons gave him the opportunity; he remained there, in order to free mankind from the fear of two most grievous things, death and imprisonment. 5. Mucius put his hand into the fire. It is painful to be burned; but how much more painful to inflict such suffering upon oneself! Here was a man of no learning, not primed to face death and pain by any words of wisdom, and equipped only with the courage of a soldier, who punished himself for his fruitless daring; he stood and watched his own right hand falling away piecemeal on the enemy's brazier,**[2]** nor did he withdraw the dissolving limb, with its uncovered bones, until his foe removed the fire. He might have accomplished something more successful in that camp, but never anything more brave. See how much keener a brave man is to lay hold of danger than a cruel man is to inflict it: Porsenna was more ready to pardon Mucius for wishing to slay him than Mucius to pardon himself for failing to slay Porsenna!

6 ""Oh,"" say you, ""those stories have been droned to death in all the schools; pretty soon, when you reach the topic 'On Despising Death,' you will be telling me about Cato."" But why should I not tell you about Cato, how he read Plato's**[3]** book on that last glorious night, with a sword laid at his pillow? He had provided these two requisites for his last moments, – the first, that he might have the will to die, and the second, that he might have the means. So he put his affairs in order, – as well as one could put in order that which was ruined and near its end, – and thought that he ought to see to it that no one should have the power to slay or the good fortune to save**[4]** Cato. 7. Drawing the sword, – which he had kept unstained from all bloodshed against the final day, he cried: ""Fortune, you have accomplished nothing by resisting all my endeavours. I have fought, till now, for my country's freedom, and not for my own, I did not strive so doggedly to be free, but only to live among the free. Now, since the affairs of mankind are beyond hope, let Cato be withdrawn to safety."" 8. So saying, he inflicted a mortal wound upon his body. After the physicians had bound it up, Cato had less blood and less strength, but no less courage; angered now not only at Caesar but also at himself, he rallied his unarmed hands against his wound, and expelled, rather than dismissed, that noble soul which had been so defiant of all worldly power.

9 I am not now heaping up these illustrations for the purpose of exercising my wit, but for the purpose of encouraging you to face that which is thought to be most terrible. And I shall encourage you all the more easily by showing that not only resolute men have despised that moment when the soul breathes its last, but that certain persons, who were craven in other respects, have equalled in this regard the courage of the bravest. Take, for example, Scipio, the father-in-law of Gnaeus Pompeius: he was driven back upon the African coast by a head-wind and saw his ship in the power of the enemy. He therefore pierced his body with a sword; and when they asked where the commander was, he replied: ""All is well with the commander."" 10. These words brought him up to the level of his ancestors and suffered not the glory which fate gave to the Scipios in Africa**[5]** to lose its continuity. It was a great deed to conquer Carthage, but a greater deed to conquer death. ""All is well with the commander!"" Ought a general to die otherwise, especially one of Cato's generals? 11. I shall not refer you to history, or collect examples of those men who throughout the ages have despised death; for they are very many. Consider these times of ours, whose enervation and over-refinement call forth our complaints; they nevertheless will include men of every rank, of every lot in life, and of every age, who have cut short their misfortunes by death.

Believe me, Lucilius; death is so little to be feared that through its good offices nothing is to be feared. 12. Therefore, when your enemy threatens, listen unconcernedly. Although your conscience makes you confident, yet, since many things have weight which are outside your case,**[6]** both hope for that which is utterly just, and prepare yourself against that which is utterly unjust. Remember, however, before all else, to strip things of all that disturbs and confuses, and to see what each is at bottom; you will then comprehend that they contain nothing fearful except the actual fear. 13. That you see happening to boys happens also to ourselves, who are only slightly bigger boys: when those whom they love, with whom they daily associate, with whom they play, appear with masks on, the boys are frightened out of their wits. We should strip the mask, not only from men, but from things, and restore to each object its own aspect.

14 ""Why dost thou**[7]** hold up before my eyes swords, fires, and a throng of executioners raging about thee? Take away all that vain show, behind which thou lurkest and scarest fools! Ah! thou art naught but Death, whom only yesterday a manservant of mine and a maid-servant did despise! Why dost thou again unfold and spread before me, with all that great display, the whip and the rack? Why are those engines of torture made ready, one for each several member of the body, and all the other innumerable machines for tearing a man apart piecemeal? Away with all such stuff, which makes us numb with terror! And thou, silence the groans the cries, and the bitter shrieks ground out of the victim as he is torn on the rack! Forsooth thou are naught but Pain, scorned by yonder gout-ridden wretch, endured by yonder dyspeptic in the midst of his dainties, borne bravely by the girl in travail. Slight thou art, if I can bear thee; short thou art if I cannot bear thee!""

15 Ponder these words which you have often heard and often uttered. Moreover, prove by the result whether that which you have heard and uttered is true. For there is a very disgraceful charge often brought against our school, – that we deal with the words, and not with the deeds, of philosophy.

What, have you only at this moment learned that death is hanging over your head, at this moment exile, at this moment grief? You were born to these perils. Let us think of everything that can happen as something which will happen. 16. I know that you have really done what I advise you to do; I now warn you not to drown your soul in these petty anxieties of yours; if you do, the soul will be dulled and will have too little vigour left when the time comes for it to arise. Remove the mind from this case of yours to the case of men in general. Say to yourself that our petty bodies are mortal and frail; pain can reach them from other sources than from wrong or the might of the stronger. Our pleasures themselves become torments; banquets bring indigestion, carousals paralysis of the muscles and palsy, sensual habits affect the feet, the hands, and every joint of the body.

17 I may become a poor man; I shall then be one among many. I may be exiled; I shall then regard myself as born in the place to which I shall be sent. They may put me in chains. What then? Am I free from bonds now? Behold this clogging burden of a body, to which nature has fettered me! ""I shall die,"" you say; you mean to say ""I shall cease to run the risk of sickness; I shall cease to run the risk of imprisonment; I shall cease to run the risk of death."" 18. I am not so foolish as to go through at this juncture the arguments which Epicurus harps upon, and say that the terrors of the world below are idle, – that Ixion does not whirl round on his wheel, that Sisyphus does not shoulder his stone uphill, that a man's entrails cannot be restored and devoured every day;**[8]** no one is so childish as to fear Cerberus, or the shadows, or the spectral garb of those who are held together by naught but their unfleshed bones. Death either annihilates us or strips us bare. If we are then released, there remains the better part, after the burden has been withdrawn; if we are annihilated, nothing remains; good and bad are alike removed.

19 Allow me at this point to quote a verse of yours, first suggesting that, when you wrote it, you meant it for yourself no less than for others. It is ignoble to say one thing and mean another; and how much more ignoble to write one thing and mean another! I remember one day you were handling the well-known commonplace, – that we do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees; we die every day. 20. For every day a little of our life is taken from us; even when we are growing, our life is on the wane. We lose our childhood, then our boyhood, and then our youth. Counting even yesterday, all past time is lost time; the very day which we are now spending is shared between ourselves and death. It is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that which previously has flowed out; similarly, the final hour when we cease to exist does not of itself bring death; it merely of itself completes the death-process. We reach death at that moment, but we have been a long time on the way. 21. In describing this situation, you said in your customary, style (for you are always impressive, but never more pungent than when you are putting the truth in appropriate words):

    Not single is the death which comes; the death
    Which takes us off is but the last of all.

I prefer that you should read your own words rather than my letter; for then it will be clear to you that this death, of which we are afraid, is the last but not the only death. 22. I see what you are looking for; you are asking what I have packed into my letter, what inspiriting saying from some master-mind, what useful precept. So I shall send you something dealing with this very subject which has been under discussion. Epicurus**[9]** upbraids those who crave, as much as those who shrink from, death: ""It is absurd,"" he says, ""to run towards death because you are tired of life, when it is your manner of life that has made you run towards death."" 23. And in another passage:**[10]** ""What is so absurd as to seek death, when it is through fear of death that you have robbed your life of peace?"" And you may add a third statement, of the same stamp:**[11]** ""Men are so thoughtless, nay, so mad, that some, through fear of death, force themselves to die.""

24 Whichever of these ideas you ponder, you will strengthen your mind for the endurance alike of death and of life. For we need to be warned and strengthened in both directions, – not to love or to hate life overmuch; even when reason advises us to make an end of it, the impulse is not to be adopted without reflection or at headlong speed. 25. The grave and wise man should not beat a hasty retreat from life; he should make a becoming exit. And above all, he should avoid the weakness which has taken possession of so many, – the lust for death. For just as there is an unreflecting tendency of the mind towards other things, so, my dear Lucilius, there is an unreflecting tendency towards death; this often seizes upon the noblest and most spirited men, as well as upon the craven and the abject. The former despise life; the latter find it irksome.

26 Others also are moved by a satiety of doing and seeing the same things, and not so much by a hatred of life as because they are cloyed with it. We slip into this condition, while philosophy itself pushes us on, and we say; ""How long must I endure the same things? Shall I continue to wake and sleep, be hungry and be cloyed, shiver and perspire? There is an end to nothing; all things are connected in a sort of circle; they flee and they are pursued. Night is close at the heels of day, day at the heels of night; summer ends in autumn, winter rushes after autumn, and winter softens into spring; all nature in this way passes, only to return. I do nothing new; I see nothing new; sooner or later one sickens of this, also."" There are many who think that living is not painful, but superfluous. Farewell.

1355777010.0,13,self.Stoicism,150f2r,"On Practising what you Preach - Seneca, Letter 20",ThatsOK,17,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/150f2r/on_practising_what_you_preach_seneca_letter_20/,"1 If you are in good health and if you think yourself worthy of becoming at last your own master, I am glad. For the credit will be mine, if I can drag you from the floods in which you are being buffeted without hope of emerging. This, however, my dear Lucilius, I ask and beg of you, on your part, that you let wisdom sink into your soul, and test your progress, not by mere speech or writings, but by stoutness of heart and decrease of desire. Prove your words by your deeds.

2 Far different is the purpose of those who are speech-making and trying to win the approbation of a throng of hearers, far different that of those who allure the ears of young men and idlers by many-sided or fluent argumentation; philosophy teaches us to act, not to speak; it exacts of every man that he should live according to his own standards, that his life should not be out of harmony with his words, and that, further, his inner life should be of one hue and not out of harmony with all his activities. This, I say, is the highest duty and the highest proof of wisdom, – that deed and word should be in accord, that a man should be equal to himself under all conditions, and always the same.

""But,"" you reply, ""who can maintain this standard?"" Very few, to be sure; but there are some. It is indeed a hard undertaking, and I do not say that the philosopher can always keep the same pace. But he can always travel the same path. 3. Observe yourself, then, and see whether your dress and your house are inconsistent, whether you treat yourself lavishly and your family meanly, whether you eat frugal dinners and yet build luxurious houses. You should lay hold, once for all, upon a single norm to live by, and should regulate your whole life according to this norm. Some men restrict themselves at home, but strut with swelling port before the public; such discordance is a fault, and it indicates a wavering mind which cannot yet keep its balance. 4. And I can tell you, further, whence arise this unsteadiness and disagreement of action and purpose; it is because no man resolves upon what he wishes, and, even if he has done so, he does not persist in it, but jumps the track; not only does he change, but he returns and slips back to the conduct which he has abandoned and abjured. 5. Therefore, to omit the ancient definitions of wisdom and to include the whole manner of human life, I can be satisfied with the following: ""What is wisdom? Always desiring the same things, and always refusing the same things.""**[1]** You may be excused from adding the little proviso, – that what you wish, should be right; since no man can always be satisfied with the same thing, unless it is right.

6 For this reason men do not know what they wish, except at the actual moment of wishing; no man ever decided once and for all to desire or to refuse. Judgment varies from day to day, and changes to the opposite, making many a man pass his life in a kind of game. Press on, therefore, as you have begun; perhaps you will be led to perfection, or to a point which you alone understand is still short of perfection.

7 ""But what,"" you say, ""will become of my crowded household without a household income?"" If you stop supporting that crowd, it will support itself; or perhaps you will learn by the bounty of poverty what you cannot learn by your own bounty. Poverty will keep for you your true and tried friends; you will be rid of the men who were not seeking you for yourself, but for something which you have. Is it not true, however, that you should love poverty, if only for this single reason, – that it will show you those by whom you are loved? O when will that time come, when no one shall tell lies to compliment you! 8. Accordingly, let your thoughts, your efforts, your desires, help to make you content with your own self and with the goods that spring from yourself; and commit all your other prayers to God's keeping! What happiness could come closer home to you? Bring yourself down to humble conditions, from which you cannot be ejected and in order that you may do so with greater alacrity, the contribution contained in this letter shall refer to that subject; I shall bestow it upon you forthwith.

9 Although you may look askance, Epicurus**[2]** will once again be glad to settle my indebtedness: ""Believe me, your words will be more imposing if you sleep on a cot and wear rags. For in that case you will not be merely saying them; you will be demonstrating their truth."" I, at any rate, listen in a different spirit to the utterances of our friend Demetrius, after I have seen him reclining without even a cloak to cover him, and, more than this, without rugs to lie upon. He is not only a teacher of the truth, but a witness to the truth. 10. ""May not a man, however, despise wealth when it lies in his very pocket?"" Of course; he also is great-souled, who sees riches heaped up round him and, after wondering long and deeply because they have come into his possession, smiles, and hears rather than feels that they are his. It means much not to be spoiled by intimacy with riches; and he is truly great who is poor amidst riches. 11. ""Yes, but I do not know,"" you say, ""how the man you speak of will endure poverty, if he falls into it suddenly."" Nor do I, Epicurus, know whether the poor man you speak of will despise riches, should he suddenly fall into them; accordingly, in the case of both, it is the mind that must be appraised, and we must investigate whether your man is pleased with his poverty, and whether my man is displeased with his riches. Otherwise, the cot-bed and the rags are slight proof of his good intentions, if it has not been made clear that the person concerned endures these trials not from necessity but from preference.

12 It is the mark, however, of a noble spirit not to precipitate oneself into such things**[3]** on the ground that they are better, but to practise for them on the ground that they are thus easy to endure. And they are easy to endure, Lucilius; when, however, you come to them after long rehearsal, they are even pleasant; for they contain a sense of freedom from care, – and without this nothing is pleasant. 13. I hold it essential, therefore, to do as I have told you in a letter that great men have often done: to reserve a few days in which we may prepare ourselves for real poverty by means of fancied poverty. There is all the more reason for doing this, because we have been steeped in luxury and regard all duties as hard and onerous. Rather let the soul be roused from its sleep and be prodded, and let it be reminded that nature has prescribed very little for us. No man is born rich. Every man, when he first sees light, is commanded to be content with milk and rags. Such is our beginning, and yet kingdoms are all too small for us!**[4]** Farewell.

___________________________________________________________________


At another time the problem arose among us whether for the acquisition of virtue practice**[1]** or theory is more effective, understanding that theory teaches what is right conduct, while practice represents the habit of those accustomed to act in accordance with such theory. To Musonius, practice seemed to be more effective, and speaking in support of his opinion, he asked one of those present the following question:

""Suppose that there are two physicians, one able to discourse very brilliantly about the art of medicine but having no experience in taking care of the sick, and the other quite incapable of speaking but experienced in treating his patients according to correct medical theory. Which one,"" he asked, "" would you choose to attend you if you were ill? "" He replied that he would choose the doctor who had experience in healing.

Musonius then continued, ""Well, then, let us take another example of two men. One has sailed a great deal and served as pilot on many boats, the other one has sailed very little and has never acted as pilot. If the one who had never piloted a ship should speak most ably on the methods of navigation, and the other very poorly and ineffectively, which one would you employ as pilot if you were going on a voyage?"" The man said he would take the experienced pilot.

Again Musonius said, ""Take the case of two musicians. One knows the theory of music and discourses on it most convincingly but is unable to sing or play the harp or the lyre; the other is inferior in theory but is proficient in playing the harp and the lyre and in singing as well. To which one would you give a position as musician, or which one would you like to have as teacher for a child who does not know music?"" The man answered that he would choose the one who was skilled in practice. **[2]**

""Well, then,"" said Musonius, ""that being the case, in the matter of temperance and self-control, is it not much better to be self-controlled and temperate in all one's actions than to be able to say what one ought to do?"" Here too the young man agreed that it is of less significance and importance to speak well about self-control than to practice self-control.

Thereupon Musonius, drawing together what had been said, asked, ""How, now, in view of these conclusions, could knowledge of the theory of anything be better than becoming accustomed to act according to the principles of the theory, if we understand that application enables one to act, but theory makes one capable of speaking about it? Theory which teaches how one should act is related to application, and comes first, since it is not possible to do anything really well unless its practical execution be in harmony with theory. In effectiveness, however, practice takes precedence over theory as being more influential in leading men to action.""



**[1]** *The word έθος which has been translated 'practice' is puzzling. Musonius seems to have in mind some practical school exercise as contrasted with pure theory (λόγος); for conduct in daily life he generally uses πραξις*.

**[2]** *Unless one bears in mind the background against which they are told, these examples seem altogether too simple and obvious to be worthy of Musonius. Apparently he has developed the thesis that practice is more effective than theory to combat the influence of the older sophists who professed to talk better on any subject than the experts in that field. Cicero (De Oratore II, 75) illustrates the pretentious claims of the sophists by his story of the philosopher Phormio. The presumptuous fellow had the temerity to give a discourse on military strategy, though he had never even seen an army or a camp, before the exiled Hannibal in Ephesus. The rest of the audience was thoroughly delighted, but Hannibal remarked that he had seen a good many crazy people in his life, but never any one crazier than Phormio*.

I noticed something like this other day. While I felt quite calm and positive in attitude, I had lost my usual ability to enjoy even simple pleasures, like the view of the mountains on my way to work. It's not that I was suppressing my feelings, I just honestly didn't care about the view beyond the most cursory notice of its presence. 

Likewise, when I was socializing with friends, I felt like I wasn't contributing as much as usual. Somehow my usual humor and creativity was lacking, even though I was in a fine mood and paying attention to the conversation.  

This seems to be a side-effect of placing value on virtue and not pleasure; I am more interested in what I can do rather than what I can enjoy. But it doesn't seem quite right somehow. While chasing pleasures is unwise, I would think that I should still be able to enjoy the things that present themselves to me, especially when they don't cost me anything (the view out the window, etc.)?

I certainly didn't set out to become this unemotional, and I'm fully aware that that's not the point of Stoicism. Yet for me it seems to be the natural outcome of practicing Stoicism as I understand it. Am I missing something?

I thought it was okay and a pretty good action flick. Kinda Predictable. Upon further reflection I noticed a little bit of stoic thought in one scene in particular. When Tony is driving in his Audi and talking to the boy (who has the Iron Man suit) he finds out that the suit has not been charging and he pulled over immediately in his car, having a severe anxiety attack. The boy is still talking to Tony and says ""You're a mechanic right? Can't you just build something?"" Tony then pops up from his attack, his anxiety completely gone and just says ""Thanks"". 

Now I am reading a book recommended a lot on this subreddit, A guide to the good life: The ancient art of stoic joy, where the author talks about internalizing your goals so that you have complete control over the ""Things"" in your life, and only worry about those things, instead of letting the stuff that is not under your control affect you and cause you anxiety and worry. In this way, the boy helps Tony to reevaluate his situation based on what he is in control of. Immediately tony realizes that he CAN use his genius  to build something useful, like he did in the first movie.

If there is any good in philosophy, it is this, – that it never looks into pedigrees. All men, if traced back to their original source, spring from the gods. 2. You are a Roman knight, and your persistent work promoted you to this class; yet surely there are many to whom the fourteen rows are barred;**[1]** the senate-chamber is not open to all; the army, too, is scrupulous in choosing those whom it admits to toil and danger. But a noble mind is free to all men; according to this test, we may all gain distinction. Philosophy neither rejects nor selects anyone; its light shines for all. 3. Socrates was no aristocrat. Cleanthes worked at a well and served as a hired man watering a garden. Philosophy did not find Plato already a nobleman; it made him one. Why then should you despair of becoming able to rank with men like these? They are all your ancestors, if you conduct yourself in a manner worthy of them; and you will do so if you convince yourself at the outset that no man outdoes you in real nobility. 4. We have all had the same number of forefathers; there is no man whose first beginning does not transcend memory. Plato says: ""Every king springs from a race of slaves, and every slave has had kings among his ancestors.""**[2]** The flight of time, with its vicissitudes, has jumbled all such things together, and Fortune has turned them upside down. 5. Then who is well-born? He who is by nature well fitted for virtue. That is the one point to be considered; otherwise, if you hark back to antiquity, every one traces back to a date before which there is nothing. From the earliest beginnings of the universe to the present time, we have been led forward out of origins that were alternately illustrious and ignoble. A hall full of smoke-begrimed busts does not make the nobleman. No past life has been lived to lend us glory, and that which has existed before us is not ours; the soul alone renders us noble, and it may rise superior to Fortune out of any earlier condition, no matter what that condition has been.**[3]**

6 Suppose, then, that you were not that Roman knight, but a freedman, you might nevertheless by your own efforts come to be the only free man amid a throng of gentlemen. ""How?"" you ask. Simply by distinguishing between good and bad things without patterning your opinion from the populace. You should look, not to the source from which these things come, but to the goal towards which they tend. If there is anything that can make life happy, it is good on its own merits; for it cannot degenerate into evil. 7. Where, then, lies the mistake, since all men crave the happy life? It is that they regard the means for producing happiness as happiness itself, and, while seeking happiness, they are really fleeing from it. For although the sum and substance of the happy life is unalloyed freedom from care, and though the secret of such freedom is unshaken confidence, yet men gather together that which causes worry, and, while travelling life's treacherous road, not only have burdens to bear, but even draw burdens to themselves; hence they recede farther and farther from the achievement of that which they seek, and the more effort they expend, the more they hinder themselves and are set back. This is what happens when you hurry through a maze; the faster you go, the worse you are entangled. Farewell.

1364846637.0,12,self.Stoicism,1bg5s1,"On the proper style for a philosopher's discourse - Seneca, Letter 40",ThatsOK,16,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1bg5s1/on_the_proper_style_for_a_philosophers_discourse/,"1 I thank you for writing to me so often; for you are revealing your real self to me in the only way you can. I never receive a letter from you without being in your company forthwith. If the pictures of our absent friends are pleasing to us, though they only refresh the memory and lighten our longing by a solace that is unreal and unsubstantial, how much more pleasant is a letter, which brings us real traces, real evidences, of an absent friend! For that which is sweetest when we meet face to face is afforded by the impress of a friend's hand upon his letter, – recognition.

2 You write me that you heard a lecture by the philosopher Serapio,**[1]** when he landed at your present place of residence. ""He is wont,"" you say, ""to wrench up his words with a mighty rush, and he does not let them flow forth one by one, but makes them crowd and dash upon each other.**[2]** For the words come in such quantity that a single voice is inadequate to utter them."" I do not approve of this in a philosopher; his speech, like his life, should be composed; and nothing that rushes headlong and is hurried is well ordered. That is why, in Homer, the rapid style, which sweeps down without a break like a snow-squall, is assigned to the younger speaker; from the old man eloquence flows gently, sweeter than honey.**[3]**

3 Therefore, mark my words; that forceful manner of speech, rapid and copious, is more suited to a mountebank than to a man who is discussing and teaching an important and serious subject. But I object just as strongly that he should drip out his words as that he should go at top speed; he should neither keep the ear on the stretch, nor deafen it. For that poverty-stricken and thin-spun style also makes the audience less attentive because they are weary of its stammering slowness; nevertheless, the word which has been long awaited sinks in more easily than the word which flits past us on the wing. Finally, people speak of ""handing down"" precepts to their pupils; but one is not ""handing down"" that which eludes the grasp. 4. Besides, speech that deals with the truth should be unadorned and plain. This popular style has nothing to do with the truth; its aim is to impress the common herd, to ravish heedless ears by its speed; it does not offer itself for discussion, but snatches itself away from discussion. But how can that speech govern others which cannot itself be governed? May I not also remark that all speech which is employed for the purpose of healing our minds, ought to sink into us? Remedies do not avail unless they remain in the system.

5 Besides, this sort of speech contains a great deal of sheer emptiness; it has more sound than power. My terrors should be quieted, my irritations soothed, my illusions shaken off, my indulgences checked, my greed rebuked. And which of these cures can be brought about in a hurry? What physician can heal his patient on a flying visit? May I add that such a jargon of confused and ill-chosen words cannot afford pleasure, either? 6. No; but just as you are well satisfied, in the majority of cases, to have seen through tricks which you did not think could possibly be done,**[4]** so in the case of these word-gymnasts to have heard them once is amply sufficient. For what can a man desire to learn or to imitate in them? What is he to think of their souls, when their speech is sent into the charge in utter disorder, and cannot be kept in hand? 7. Just as, when you run down hill, you cannot stop at the point where you had decided to stop, but your steps are carried along by the momentum of your body and are borne beyond the place where you wished to halt; so this speed of speech has no control over itself, nor is it seemly for philosophy; since philosophy should carefully place her words, not fling them out, and should proceed step by step.

8 ""What then?"" you say; ""should not philosophy sometimes take a loftier tone?"" Of course she should; but dignity of character should be preserved, and this is stripped away by such violent and excessive force. Let philosophy possess great forces, but kept well under control; let her stream flow unceasingly, but never become a torrent. And I should hardly allow even to an orator a rapidity of speech like this, which cannot be called back, which goes lawlessly ahead; for how could it be followed by jurors, who are often inexperienced and untrained? Even when the orator is carried away by his desire to show off his powers, or by uncontrollable emotion, even then he should not quicken his pace and heap up words to an extent greater than the ear can endure.

9 You will be acting rightly, therefore, if you do not regard those men who seek how much they may say, rather than how they shall say it, and if for yourself you choose, provided a choice must be made, to speak as Publius Vinicius the stammerer does. When Asellius was asked how Vinicius spoke, he replied: ""Gradually""! (It was a remark of Geminus Varius, by the way: ""I don't see how you can call that man 'eloquent'; why, he can't get out three words together."") Why, then, should you not choose to speak as Vinicius does? 10. Though of course some wag may cross your path, like the person who said, when Vinicius was dragging out his words one by one, as if he were dictating and not speaking. ""Say, haven't you anything to say?"" And yet that were the better choice, for the rapidity of Quintus Haterius, the most famous orator of his age, is, in my opinion, to be avoided by a man of sense. Haterius never hesitated, never paused; he made only one start, and only one stop.

11 However, I suppose that certain styles of speech are more or less suitable to nations also; in a Greek you can put up with the unrestrained style, but we Romans, even when writing, have become accustomed to separate our words.**[5]** And our compatriot Cicero, with whom Roman oratory sprang into prominence, was also a slow pacer.**[6]** The Roman language is more inclined to take stock of itself, to weigh, and to offer something worth weighing. 12. Fabianius, a man noteworthy because of his life, his knowledge, and, less important than either of these, his eloquence also, used to discuss a subject with dispatch rather than with haste; hence you might call it ease rather than speed. I approve this quality in the wise man; but I do not demand it; only let his speech proceed unhampered, though I prefer that it should be deliberately uttered rather than spouted.

13 However, I have this further reason for frightening you away from the latter malady, namely, that you could only be successful in practising this style by losing your sense of modesty; you would have to rub all shame from your countenance,**[7]** and refuse to hear yourself speak. For that heedless flow will carry with it many expressions which you would wish to criticize. 14. And, I repeat, you could not attain it and at the same time preserve your sense of shame. Moreover, you would need to practise every day, and transfer your attention from subject matter to words. But words, even if they came to you readily and flowed without any exertion on your part, yet would have to be kept under control. For just as a less ostentatious gait becomes a philosopher, so does a restrained style of speech, far removed from boldness. Therefore, the ultimate kernel of my remarks is this: I bid you be slow of speech. Farewell

I shall take every liberty; for I do not love this one**[1]** if I am unwilling to hurt his feelings. ""What,"" you say, ""do you expect to keep a forty-year-old ward under your tutelage? Consider his age, how hardened it now is, and past handling! 2. Such a man cannot be re-shaped; only young minds are moulded."" I do not know whether I shall make progress; but I should prefer to lack success rather than to lack faith. You need not despair of curing sick men even when the disease is chronic, if only you hold out against excess and force them to do and submit to many things against their will. As regards our other friend I am not sufficiently confident, either, except for the fact that he still has sense of shame enough to blush for his sins. This modesty should be fostered; so long as it endures in his soul, there is some room for hope. But as for this veteran of yours, I think we should deal more carefully with him, that he may not become desperate about himself. 3. There is no better time to approach him than now, when he has an interval of rest and seems like one who has corrected his faults. Others have been cheated by this interval of virtue on his part, but he does not cheat me. I feel sure that these faults will return, as it were, with compound interest, for just now, I am certain, they are in abeyance but not absent. I shall devote some time to the matter, and try to see whether or not something can be done.

4 But do you yourself, as indeed you are doing, show me that you are stout-hearted; lighten your baggage for the march. None of our possessions is essential. Let us return to the law of nature; for then riches are laid up for us. The things which we actually need are free for all, or else cheap; nature craves only bread and water. No one is poor according to this standard; when a man has limited his desires within these bounds, he can challenge the happiness of Jove himself, as Epicurus says. I must insert in this letter one or two more of his sayings:**[2]** 5. ""Do everything as if Epicurus were watching you."" There is no real doubt that it is good for one to have appointed a guardian over oneself, and to have someone whom you may look up to, someone whom you may regard as a witness of your thoughts. It is, indeed, nobler by far to live as you would live under the eyes of some good man, always at your side; but nevertheless I am content if you only act, in whatever you do, as you would act if anyone at all were looking on; because solitude prompts us to all kinds of evil. 6. And when you have progressed so far that you have also respect for yourself, you may send away your attendant; but until then, set as a guard over yourself the authority of some man, whether your choice be the great Cato or Scipio, or Laelius, – or any man in whose presence even abandoned wretches would check their bad impulses. Meantime, you are engaged in making of yourself the sort of person in whose company you would not dare to sin. When this aim has been accomplished and you begin to hold yourself in some esteem, I shall gradually allow you to do what Epicurus, in another passage, suggests:**[3]** ""The time when you should most of all withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd.""

7 You ought to make yourself of a different stamp from the multitude. Therefore, while it is not yet safe to withdraw into solitude,**[4]** seek out certain individuals; for everyone is better off in the company of somebody or other, – no matter who, – than in his own company alone. ""The time when you should most of all withdraw into yourself is when you are forced to be in a crowd."" Yes, provided that you are a good, tranquil, and self-restrained man; otherwise, you had better withdraw into a crowd in order to get away from your self. Alone, you are too close to a rascal. Farewell.

There are certain things which can be pointed out only by someone who is present. The physician cannot prescribe by letter the proper time for eating or bathing; he must feel the pulse. There is an old adage about gladiators, – that they plan their fight in the ring; as they intently watch, something in the adversary's glance, some movement of his hand, even some slight bending of his body, gives a warning. 2. We can formulate general rules and commit them to writing, as to what is usually done, or ought to be done; such advice may be given, not only to our absent friends, but also to succeeding generations. In regard, however, to that second**[1]** question, – when or how your plan is to be carried out, – no one will advise at long range; we must take counsel in the presence of the actual situation. 3. You must be not only present in the body, but watchful in mind, if you would avail yourself of the fleeting opportunity. Accordingly, look about you for the opportunity; if you see it, grasp it, and with all your energy and with all your strength devote yourself to this task – to rid yourself of those business duties.

Now listen carefully to the opinion which I shall offer; it is my opinion that you should withdraw either from that kind of existence, or else from existence altogether. But I likewise maintain that you should take a gentle path, that you may loosen rather than cut the knot which you have bungled so badly in tying, – provided that if there shall be no other way of loosening it, you may actually cut it. No man is so faint-hearted that he would rather hang in suspense for ever than drop once for all. 4. Meanwhile, – and this is of first importance, – do not hamper yourself; be content with the business into which you have lowered yourself, or, as you prefer to have people think, have tumbled. There is no reason why you should be struggling on to something further; if you do, you will lose all grounds of excuse, and men will see that it was not a tumble. The usual explanation which men offer is wrong: ""I was compelled to do it. Suppose it was against my will; I had to do it."" But no one is compelled to pursue prosperity at top speed; it means something to call a halt, – even if one does not offer resistance, – instead of pressing eagerly after favouring fortune. 5. Shall you then be put out with me, if I not only come to advise you, but also call in others to advise you, – wiser heads than my own, men before whom I am wont to lay any problem upon which l am pondering? Read the letter of Epicurus**[2]** which appears on this matter; it is addressed to Idomeneus. The writer asks him to hasten as fast as he can, and beat a retreat before some stronger influence comes between and takes from him the liberty to withdraw. 6. But he also adds that one should attempt nothing except at the time when it can be attempted suitably and seasonably. Then, when the long-sought occasion comes, let him be up and doing. Epicurus forbids**[3]** us to doze when we are meditating escape; he bids us hope for a safe release from even the hardest trials, provided that we are not in too great a hurry before the time, nor too dilatory when the time arrives.

7 Now, I suppose, you are looking for a Stoic motto also. There is really no reason why anyone should slander that school to you on the ground of its rashness; as a matter of fact, its caution is greater than its courage. You are perhaps expecting the sect to utter such words as these: ""It is base to flinch under a burden. Wrestle with the duties which you have once undertaken. No man is brave and earnest if he avoids danger, if his spirit does not grow with the very difficulty of his task."" 8. Words like these will indeed be spoken to you, if only your perseverance shall have an object that is worth while, if only you will not have to do or to suffer anything unworthy of a good man; besides, a good man will not waste himself upon mean and discreditable work or be busy merely for the sake of being busy. Neither will he, as you imagine, become so involved in ambitious schemes that he will have continually to endure their ebb and flow. Nay, when he sees the dangers, uncertainties, and hazards in which he was formerly tossed about, he will withdraw, – not turning his back to the foe, but falling back little by little to a safe position. 9. From business, however, my dear Lucilius, it is easy to escape, if only you will despise the rewards of business. We are held back and kept from escaping by thoughts like these: ""What then? Shall I leave behind me these great prospects? Shall I depart at the very time of harvest? Shall I have no slaves at my side? no retinue for my litter? no crowd in my reception room?""

Hence men leave such advantages as these with reluctance; they love the reward of their hardships, but curse the hardships themselves. 10. Men complain about their ambitions as they complain about their mistresses; in other words, if you penetrate their real feelings, you will find, not hatred, but bickering. Search the minds of those who cry down what they have desired, who talk about escaping from things which they are unable to do without; you will comprehend that they are lingering of their own free will in a situation which they declare they find it hard and wretched to endure. 11. It is so, my dear Lucilius; there are a few men whom slavery holds fast, but there are many more who hold fast to slavery.

If, however, you intend to be rid of this slavery; if freedom is genuinely pleasing in your eyes; and if you seek counsel for this one purpose, – that you may have the good fortune to accomplish this purpose without perpetual annoyance, – how can the whole company of Stoic thinkers fail to approve your course? Zeno, Chrysippus, and all their kind will give you advice that is temperate, honourable, and suitable. 12. But if you keep turning round and looking about, in order to see how much you may carry away with you, and how much money you may keep to equip yourself for the life of leisure, you will never find a way out. No man can swim ashore and take his baggage with him. Rise to a higher life, with the favour of the gods; but let it not be favour of such a kind as the gods give to men when with kind and genial faces they bestow magnificent ills, justified in so doing by the one fact that the things which irritate and torture have been bestowed in answer to prayer.

13 I was just putting the seal upon this letter; but it must be broken again, in order that it may go to you with its customary contribution, bearing with it some noble word. And lo, here is one that occurs to my mind; I do not know whether its truth or its nobility of utterance is the greater. ""Spoken by whom?"" you ask. By Epicurus;**[4]** for I am still appropriating other men's belongings. 14. The words are: ""Everyone goes out of life just as if he had but lately entered it."" Take anyone off his guard, young, old, or middle-aged; you will find that all are equally afraid of death, and equally ignorant of life. No one has anything finished, because we have kept putting off into the future all our undertakings.**[5]** No thought in the quotation given above pleases me more than that it taunts old men with being infants. 15. ""No one,"" he says, ""leaves this world in a different manner from one who has just been born."" That is not true; for we are worse when we die than when we were born; but it is our fault, and not that of Nature. Nature should scold us, saying: ""What does this mean? I brought you into the world without desires or fears, free from superstition, treachery and the other curses. Go forth as you were when you entered!""

16 A man has caught the message of wisdom, if he can die as free from care as he was at birth; but as it is we are all a-flutter at the approach of the dreaded end. Our courage fails us, our cheeks blanch; our tears fall, though they are unavailing. But what is baser than to fret at the very threshold of peace? 17. The reason, however is, that we are stripped of all our goods, we have jettisoned our cargo of life and are in distress; for no part of it has been packed in the hold; it has all been heaved overboard and has drifted away. Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long. Farewell.

For they fill me with hope; they are now not mere assurances concerning you, but guarantees. And I beg and pray you to proceed in this course; for what better request could I make of a friend than one which is to be made for his own sake? If possible, withdraw yourself from all the business of which you speak; and if you cannot do this, tear yourself away. We have dissipated enough of our time already – let us in old age begin to pack up our baggage. 2. Surely there is nothing in this that men can begrudge us. We have spent our lives on the high seas; let us die in harbour. Not that I would advise you to try to win fame by your retirement; one's retirement should neither be paraded nor concealed. Not concealed, I say, for I shall not go so far in urging you as to expect you to condemn all men as mad and then seek out for yourself a hiding-place and oblivion; rather make this your business, that your retirement be not conspicuous, though it should be obvious. 3 In the second place, while those whose choice is unhampered from the start will deliberate on that other question, whether they wish to pass their lives in obscurity, in your case there is not a free choice. Your ability and energy have thrust you into the work of the world; so have the charm of your writings and the friendships you have made with famous and notable men. Renown has already taken you by storm. You may sink yourself into the depths of obscurity and utterly hide yourself; yet your earlier acts will reveal you. 4. You cannot keep lurking in the dark; much of the old gleam will follow you wherever you fly.

Peace you can claim for yourself without being disliked by anyone, without any sense of loss, and without any pangs of spirit. For what will you leave behind you that you can imagine yourself reluctant to leave? Your clients? But none of these men courts you for yourself; they merely court something from you. People used to hunt friends, but now they hunt pelf; if a lonely old man changes his will, the morning-caller transfers himself to another door. Great things cannot be bought for small sums; so reckon up whether it is preferable to leave your own true self, or merely some of your belongings. 5. Would that you had had the privilege of growing old amid the limited circumstances of your origin, and that fortune had not raised you to such heights! You were removed far from the sight of wholesome living by your swift rise to prosperity, by your province, by your position as procurator,**[1]** and by all that such things promise; you will next acquire more important duties and after them still more. And what will be the result? 6. Why wait until there is nothing left for you to crave? That time will never come. We hold that there is a succession of causes, from which fate is woven; similarly, you may be sure, there is a succession in our desires; for one begins where its predecessor ends. You have been thrust into an existence which will never of itself put an end to your wretchedness and your slavery. Withdraw your chafed neck from the yoke; it is better that it should be cut off once for all, than galled for ever. 7. If you retreat to privacy, everything will be on a smaller scale, but you will be satisfied abundantly; in your present condition, however, there is no satisfaction in the plenty which is heaped upon you on all sides. Would you rather be poor and sated, or rich and hungry? Prosperity is not only greedy, but it also lies exposed to the greed of others. And as long as nothing satisfies you, you yourself cannot satisfy others.

8 ""But,"" you say, ""how can I take my leave?"" Any way you please. Reflect how many hazards you have ventured for the sake of money, and how much toil you have undertaken for a title! You must dare something to gain leisure, also, – or else grow old amid the worries of procuratorships**[2]** abroad and subsequently of civil duties at home, living in turmoil and in ever fresh floods of responsibilities, which no man has ever succeeded in avoiding by unobtrusiveness or by seclusion of life. For what bearing on the case has your personal desire for a secluded life? Your position in the world desires the opposite! What if, even now, you allow that position to grow greater? But all that is added to your successes will be added to your fears. 9. At this point I should like to quote a saying of Maecenas, who spoke the truth when he stood on the very summit:**[3]** ""There's thunder even on the loftiest peaks."" If you ask me in what book these words are found, they occur in the volume entitled Prometheus.**[4]** He simply meant to say that these lofty peaks have their tops surrounded with thunder-storms. But is any power worth so high a price that a man like you would ever, in order to obtain it, adopt a style so debauched as that?**[5]** Maecenas was indeed a man of parts, who would have left a great pattern for Roman oratory to follow, had his good fortune not made him effeminate, – nay, had it not emasculated him! An end like his awaits you also, unless you forthwith shorten sail and, – as Maecenas was not willing to do until it was too late, – hug the shore!

10 This saying of Maecenas's might have squared my account with you; but I feel sure, knowing you, that you will get out an injunction against me, and that you will be unwilling to accept payment of my debt in such crude and debased currency. However that may be, I shall draw on the account of Epicurus.**[6]** He says: ""You must reflect carefully beforehand with whom you are to eat and drink, rather than what you are to eat and drink. For a dinner of meats without the company of a friend is like the life of a lion or a wolf."" 11. This privilege will not be yours unless you withdraw from the world; otherwise, you will have as guests only those whom your slave-secretary**[7]** sorts out from the throng of callers. It is, however, a mistake to select your friend in the reception-hall or to test him at the dinner-table. The most serious misfortune for a busy man who is overwhelmed by his possessions is, that he believes men to be his friends when he himself is not a friend to them, and that he deems his favours to be effective in winning friends, although, in the case of certain men, the more they owe, the more they hate. A trifling debt makes a man your debtor; a large one makes him an enemy. 12. ""What,"" you say, ""do not kindnesses establish friendships?"" They do, if one has had the privilege of choosing those who are to receive them, and if they are placed judiciously, instead of being scattered broadcast.

Therefore, while you are beginning to call your mind your own, meantime apply this maxim of the wise: consider that it is more important who receives a thing, than what it is he receives. Farewell.

1354831227.0,12,self.Stoicism,14enwj,"On philosophy and riches - Seneca, Letter 17",ThatsOK,14,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/14enwj/on_philosophy_and_riches_seneca_letter_17/,"1 Cast away everything of that sort, if you are wise; nay, rather that you may be wise; strive toward a sound mind at top speed and with your whole strength. If any bond holds you back, untie it, or sever it. ""But,"" you say, ""my estate delays me; I wish to make such disposition of it that it may suffice for me when I have nothing to do, lest either poverty be a burden to me, or I myself a burden to others."" 2. You do not seem, when you say this, to know the strength and power of that good which you are considering. You do indeed grasp the all important thing, the great benefit which philosophy confers, but you do not yet discern accurately its various functions, nor do you yet know how great is the help we receive from philosophy in everything, everywhere, – how, (to use Cicero's language,**[1]**) it not only succours us in the greatest matters but also descends to the smallest. Take my advice; call wisdom into consultation; she will advise you not to sit for ever at your ledger. 3. Doubtless, your object, what you wish to attain by such postponement of your studies, is that poverty may not have to be feared by you. But what if it is something to be desired? Riches have shut off many a man from the attainment of wisdom; poverty is unburdened and free from care. When the trumpet sounds, the poor man knows that he is not being attacked; when there is a cry of ""Fire,""**[2]** he only seeks a way of escape, and does not ask what he can save; if the poor man must go to sea, the harbour does not resound, nor do the wharves bustle with the retinue of one individual. No throng of slaves surrounds the poor man, – slaves for whose mouths the master must covet the fertile crops of regions beyond the sea. 4. It is easy to fill a few stomachs, when they are well trained and crave nothing else but to be filled. Hunger costs but little; squeamishness costs much. Poverty is contented with fulfilling pressing needs.

Why, then, should you reject Philosophy as a comrade? 5. Even the rich man copies her ways when he is in his senses. If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man. Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living simply is voluntary poverty. Away, then, with all excuses like: ""I have not yet enough; when I have gained the desired amount, then I shall devote myself wholly to philosophy."" And yet this ideal, which you are putting off and placing second to other interests, should be secured first of all; you should begin with it. You retort: ""I wish to acquire something to live on."" Yes, but learn while you are acquiring it; for if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to die nobly. 6. There is no reason why poverty should call us away from philosophy, – no, nor even actual want. For when hastening after wisdom, we must endure even hunger. Men have endured hunger when their towns were besieged, and what other reward for their endurance did they obtain than that they did not fall under the conqueror's power? How much greater is the promise of the prize of everlasting liberty, and the assurance that we need fear neither God nor man! Even though we starve, we must reach that goal. 7. Armies have endured all manner of want, have lived on roots, and have resisted hunger by means of food too revolting to mention. All this they have suffered to gain a kingdom, and, – what is more marvellous, – to gain a kingdom that will be another's. Will any man hesitate to endure poverty, in order that he may free his mind from madness?

Therefore one should not seek to lay up riches first; one may attain to philosophy, however, even without money for the journey. 8. It is indeed so. After you have come to possess all other things, shall you then wish to possess wisdom also? Is philosophy to be the last requisite in life, – a sort of supplement? Nay, your plan should be this: be a philosopher now, whether you have anything or not, – for if you have anything, how do you know that you have not too much already? – but if you have nothing, seek understanding first, before anything else. 9. ""But,"" you say, ""I shall lack the necessities of life."" In the first place, you cannot lack them; because nature demands but little, and the wise man suits his needs to nature. But if the utmost pinch of need arrives, he will quickly take leave of life and cease being a trouble to himself. If, however, his means of existence are meagre and scanty, he will make the best of them, without being anxious or worried about anything more than the bare necessities; he will do justice to his belly and his shoulders; with free and happy spirit he will laugh at the bustling of rich men, and the flurried ways of those who are hastening after wealth, 10. and say: ""Why of your own accord postpone your real life to the distant future? Shall you wait for some interest to fall due, or for some income on your merchandise, or for a place in the will of some wealthy old man, when you can be rich here and now. Wisdom offers wealth in ready money, and pays it over to those in whose eyes she has made wealth superfluous."" These remarks refer to other men; you are nearer the rich class. Change the age in which you live, and you have too much. But in every age, what is enough remains the same.

11 I might close my letter at this point, if I had not got you into bad habits. One cannot greet Parthian royalty without bringing a gift; and in your case I cannot say farewell without paying a price. But what of it? I shall borrow from Epicurus:**[3]** ""The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change, of troubles."" 12. I do not wonder. For the fault is not in the wealth, but in the mind itself. That which had made poverty a burden to us, has made riches also a burden. Just as it matters little whether you lay a sick man on a wooden or on a golden bed, for whithersoever he be moved he will carry his malady with him; so one need not care whether the diseased mind is bestowed upon riches or upon poverty. His malady goes with the man. Farewell.

I have to agree, This has been completely my experience as I have been on a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat and done Zazen style meditation and been left to the same feeling. 

I feel that not only is it in our disposition as being analytical but also culturally eastern philosophy is ingrained in the archetypes of that culture and do not transfer well over to us westerners (granted this isn't across the board). Carl Jung found this out when he started studying eastern religion and said the same thing. 

So how do I increase my concentration without mediation? Even though I am able to observe my ego a lot of times throughout the day and refrain (with moderate success) from having anger or anxiety filled thoughts, I still find myself having a wondering mind about various things, such as analyzing my current workout, or my relationship, or various other things instead of being completely in the moment.

So the important thing is to be virtuous and courageous no matter what outside-our-control events intrude on us. But what about the results of our actions? Are we not supposed to care about the results? 

When Aurelius says that you can aid those who have suffered but to make sure to remember that their losses are trivial compared to virtue, what does this have to say about whether helping others is itself good? (Meditations 5.36.) 

Should I not care whether results are just or unjust? Only my own actions in pursuit of justice matter, and the unjust actual results are immaterial? It’s painful to let go of the results and focus only on seeking the results in a virtuous way.

For unlike hellebore, reason should not be cast forth with the illness after it has effected a cure, but it should be allowed to remain in the soul to keep and guard the judgment. For the power of reason should not be compared to drugs but to health-giving foods, since it introduces a good and healthy frame of mind into those to whom it becomes habitual. On the other hand admonitions and warnings made when the emotions are at their greatest heat barely have any effect at all. They are not unlike those scents which revive people who have fallen in a fit but do not cure the disease.[1]

Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

In other words, no matter how difficult the way or what the consequences might be, I can follow virtue with every choice.

A variety of ancient stoics advocated the periodic use of ascetic practices to build up our stoic muscle. For example, eating plain meals or leaving behind a coat on a chilly day. Ideally, such moments would remind us of what is indifferent in life and challenge our judgements concerning the day to day.

I'm interested in what practices, if any, you impose upon yourselves. In addition, how do you schedule such things? Quarterly, weekly, whenever you feel you could use a refresher?

To share a technique I've come across, here's the ice method. My wife and I are attending a birthing course where they use ice to practice overcoming distraction. We are asked to hold ice in our hand. As it becomes increasingly uncomfortable, we practice a variety of mindfulness techniques to overcome the sensation. I've found that the stoic practices of recitation and the Discipline of Assent both work well in this situation. When the ice gets painful I can remind myself of a quote like this one by Aurelius, **If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.**

I can also examine the impression that ice presents to my body. It is likely, as time goes on, that I will notice a judgement arising in my mind that pain is bad. Instead of assenting to this idea, I recognize that nothing outside of my volition is either good or bad, it is indifferent.

For it would not have been a good thing that these creatures, born not for themselves but for service, should have been created liable to wants. Consider what it would be for us to have to take thought not only for ourselves but for sheep and asses, how they were to dress and what shoes they were to put on, and how they should find meat and drink. But just as soldiers when they appear before their general are ready shod, and clothed and armed, and it would be a strange thing indeed if the tribune had to go round and shoe or clothe his regiment, so also nature has made the creatures that are born for service ready and prepared and able to dispense with any attention. So one small child can drive sheep with a rod.

Yet we forbear to give thanks that we have not to pay the same attention to them as to ourselves, and proceed to complain against God on our own account. I declare, by Zeus and all the gods, one single fact of nature would suffice to make him that is reverent and grateful realize the providence of God: no great matter, I mean; take the mere fact that milk is produced from grass and cheese from milk and wool from skin. Who is it that has created or contrived these things?

'No one', he says.

Oh, the depth of man's stupidity and shamelessness!

Come, let us leave the chief works of nature, and behold what she works by the way. Is anything more useless than the hairs upon the chin? Did she not use even these in the most suitable way she could? Did she not by these means distinguish male and female? Does not the nature of each one of us cry aloud from afar, 'I am a man: on these terms approach me and address me; seek nothing else. Behold the signs.' Again, in women nature took the hair from their face, even as she mingled in their voice a softer note. What! You say the creature ought to have been left undistinguished and each of us to have proclaimed, 'I am a man'? Nay, but how noble and comely and dignified is this sign, how much more fair than the cock's crest, how much more magnificent than the lion's mane! Therefore we ought to preserve the signs God has given; we ought not to abandon them, nor, so far as in us lies, to confound the sexes which have been distinguished.

Are these the only works of Providence in us? Nay, what words are enough to praise them or bring them home to us? If we had sense we ought to do nothing else, in public and in private, than praise and bless God and pay Him due thanks. Ought we not, as we dig and plough and eat, to sing the hymn to God? 'Great is God that He gave us these instruments wherewith we shall till the earth. Great is God that He has given us hands, and power to swallow, and a belly, and the power to grow without knowing it, and to draw our breath in sleep.' At every moment we ought to sing these praises and above all the greatest and divinest praise, that God gave us the faculty to comprehend these gifts and to use the way of reason.

More than that: since most of you are walking in blindness, should there not be some one to discharge this duty and sing praises to God for all? What else can a lame old man as I am do but chant the praise of God? If, indeed, I were a nightingale I should sing as a nightingale, if a swan, as a swan: but as I am a rational creature I must praise God. This is my task, and I do it: and I will not abandon this duty, so long as it is given me; and I invite you all to join in this same song.

Exploring and eventually committing myself to Stoic philosophy has helped me tremendously this year. It has given me the fortitude to escape bad relationships, accept adversity as challenges, and pursue excellence and virtue in both my personal life and profession. Although I have always been skeptical of people who zealously subscribe to certain philosophies and ""isms,"" Stoicism is a way of thinking and of living to which I would like a lifelong commitment.

Accordingly, I would like to have some Stoicism-related ink done—something to serve as a daily reminder without broadcasting my mindset in an obnoxious way. I considered tattooing ""Esse Quam Videri"" on the inside of my forearm, but after further reflection the irony became too overwhelming. . . so, suggestions?

1356098233.0,11,self.Stoicism,15862h,Questions about how nature differs in Cynicism and Stoicism. [Warning: Much reading.],JayWalken,14,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/15862h/questions_about_how_nature_differs_in_cynicism/,"Hey, /r/Stoicism. Forgive me for the questions about Cynicism but I feel that they are a relevant prelude.

From the [Cynicism (philosophy)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy\)) Wikipedia article:

&gt;Their philosophy was that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, sex, and fame, and by living a simple life free from all possessions.

How does Diogenes' public masturbation and Crates' and Hipparchia's public sex not conflict with ""rejecting all conventional desires for... sex""? One argument may be that they are ""defacing the currency"" (rejecting conventional values) but this quote from Diogenes, ""I wish I could rub my stomach in the same way, and so avoid hunger"", seems to suggest that he masturbated to satisfy sexual desires.

I recently listened to a History of Philosophy (without any gaps) [podcast episode about the Cynics](http://historyofphilosophy.net/cynics) and, from memory, the 'caster seemed to claim that Diogenes did publicly masturbate and that Crates and Hipparchia did publicy have sex to satisfy sexual desires for they believed them to be natural, and so, ""in agreement with Nature"". This still seems difficult for me to accept because of the following quote from Diogenes, ""bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters"".

This is where my questions enter.

""Stoic ethics taught freedom from 'passion' by following 'reason'"".

Did Stoics categorise sexual desire as 'passion'?

If so, does living according to reason (and therefore nature) reject sexual desire (Marcus Aurelius discouraged concupiscence (""Strong sexual desire; lust"") in his Meditations) and the notion that sexual desire is ""in agreement with Nature""? Did the Stoics disagree with the Cynics about nature? Or is the podcast mistaken?

If not, did the Stoics permit satisfying sexual desires (although with more tact than the Cynics)?

Stoics advocated self-control and self-discipline. Does satisfying sexual desires, for Stoics, conflict with self-control and self-discipline?

Apologies for not having organised the questions better. I hope you are still able to answer them.

1352417954.0,12,self.Stoicism,12vukd,"On philosophy and friendship - Seneca, Letter 9",ThatsOK,16,4,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/12vukd/on_philosophy_and_friendship_seneca_letter_9/,"1 You desire to know whether Epicurus is right when, in one of his letters,**[1]** he rebukes those who hold that the wise man is self-sufficient and for that reason does not stand in need of friendships. This is the objection raised by Epicurus against Stilbo and those who believe**[2]** that the Supreme Good is a soul which is insensible to feeling.

2 We are bound to meet with a double meaning if we try to express the Greek term ""lack of feeling"" summarily, in a single word, rendering it by the Latin word impatientia. For it may be understood in the meaning the opposite to that which we wish it to have. What we mean to express is, a soul which rejects any sensation of evil; but people will interpret the idea as that of a soul which can endure no evil. Consider, therefore, whether it is not better to say ""a soul that cannot be harmed,"" or ""a soul entirely beyond the realm of suffering."" 3 There is this difference between ourselves and the other school:**[3]** our ideal wise man feels his troubles, but overcomes them; their wise man does not even feel them. But we and they alike hold this idea, - that the wise man is self-sufficient. Nevertheless, he desires friends, neighbours, and associates, no matter how much he is sufficient unto himself. 4 And mark how self-sufficient he is; for on occasion he can be content with a part of himself. If he lose a hand through disease or war, or if some accident puts out one or both of his eyes, he will be satisfied with what is left, taking as much pleasure in his impaired and maimed body as he took when it was sound. But while he does not pine for these parts if they are missing, he prefers not to lose them. 5 In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I say ""can,"" I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.

But he need never lack friends, for it lies in his own control how soon he shall make good a loss. Just as Phidias, if he lose a statue, can straightway carve another, even so our master in the art of making friendships can fill the place of a friend he has lost. 6 If you ask how one can make oneself a friend quickly, I will tell you, provided we are agreed that I may pay my debt**[4]** at once and square the account, so far as this letter is concerned. Hecato,**[5]** says: ""I can show you a philtre, compounded without drugs, herbs, or any witch's incantation: 'If you would be loved, love.'"" Now there is great pleasure, not only in maintaining old and established friendships, but also in beginning and acquiring new ones. 7 There is the same difference between winning a new friend and having already won him, as there is between the farmer who sows and the farmer who reaps. The philosopher Attalus used to say: ""It is more pleasant to make than to keep a friend, as it is more pleasant to the artist to paint than to have finished painting."" When one is busy and absorbed in one's work, the very absorption affords great delight; but when one has withdrawn one's hand from the completed masterpiece, the pleasure is not so keen. Henceforth it is the fruits of his art that he enjoys; it was the art itself that he enjoyed while he was painting. In the case of our children, their young manhood yields the more abundant fruits, but their infancy was sweeter.

8 Let us now return to the question. The wise man, I say, self-sufficient though he be, nevertheless desires friends if only for the purpose of practising friendship, in order that his noble qualities may not lie dormant. Not, however, for the purpose mentioned by Epicurus**[6]** in the letter quoted above: ""That there may be someone to sit by him when he is ill, to help him when he is in prison or in want;"" but that he may have someone by whose sick-bed he himself may sit, someone a prisoner in hostile hands whom he himself may set free. He who regards himself only, and enters upon friendships for this reason, reckons wrongly. The end will be like the beginning: he has made friends with one who might assist him out of bondage; at the first rattle of the chain such a friend will desert him. 9 These are the so-called ""fair-weather"" friendships; one who is chosen for the sake of utility will be satisfactory only so long as he is useful. Hence prosperous men are blockaded by troops of friends; but those who have failed stand amid vast loneliness their friends fleeing from the very crisis which is to test their worth. Hence, also, we notice those many shameful cases of persons who, through fear, desert or betray. The beginning and the end cannot but harmonize. He who begins to be your friend because it pays will also cease because it pays. A man will be attracted by some reward offered in exchange for his friendship, if he be attracted by aught in friendship other than friendship itself.

10 For what purpose, then, do I make a man my friend? In order to have someone for whom I may die, whom I may follow into exile, against whose death I may stake my own life, and pay the pledge, too. The friendship which you portray is a bargain and not a friendship; it regards convenience only, and looks to the results. 11 Beyond question the feeling of a lover has in it something akin to friendship; one might call it friendship run mad. But, though this is true, does anyone love for the sake of gain, or promotion, or renown? Pure**[7]** love, careless of all other things, kindles the soul with desire for the beautiful object, not without the hope of a return of the affection. What then? Can a cause which is more honourable produce a passion that is base? 12 You may retort: ""We are now discussing the question whether friendship is to be cultivated for its own sake."" On the contrary, nothing more urgently requires demonstration; for if friendship is to be sought for its own sake, he may seek it who is self-sufficient. ""How, then,"" you ask, ""does he seek it?"" Precisely as he seeks an object of great beauty, not attracted to it by desire for gain, nor yet frightened by the instability of Fortune. One who seeks friendship for favourable occasions, strips it of all its nobility.

13 ""The wise man is self-sufficient."" This phrase, my dear Lucilius, is incorrectly explained by many; for they withdraw the wise man from the world, and force him to dwell within his own skin. But we must mark with care what this sentence signifies and how far it applies; the wise man is sufficient unto himself for a happy existence, but not for mere existence. For he needs many helps towards mere existence; but for a happy existence he needs only a sound and upright soul, one that despises Fortune.

14 I should like also to state to you one of the distinctions of Chrysippus,**[8]** who declares that the wise man is in want of nothing, and yet needs many things.**[9]** ""On the other hand,"" he says, ""nothing is needed by the fool, for he does not understand how to use anything, but he is in want of everything."" The wise man needs hands, eyes, and many things that are necessary for his daily use; but he is in want of nothing. For want implies a necessity, and nothing is necessary to the wise man. 15 Therefore, although he is self-sufficient, yet he has need of friends. He craves as many friends as possible, not, however, that he may live happily; for he will live happily even without friends. The Supreme Good calls for no practical aids from outside; it is developed at home, and arises entirely within itself. If the good seeks any portion of itself from without, it begins to be subject to the play of Fortune.

16 People may say: ""But what sort of existence will the wise man have, if he be left friendless when thrown into prison, or when stranded in some foreign nation, or when delayed on a long voyage, or when out upon a lonely shore?"" His life will be like that of Jupiter, who, amid the dissolution of the world, when the gods are confounded together and Nature rests for a space from her work, can retire into himself and give himself over to his own thoughts.**[10]** In some such way as this the sage will act; he will retreat into himself, and live with himself. 17 As long as he is allowed to order his affairs according to his judgment, he is self-sufficient - and marries a wife; he is self-sufficient - and brings up children; he is self-sufficient - and yet could not live if he had to live without the society of man. Natural promptings, and not his own selfish needs, draw him into Friendships. For just as other things have for us an inherent attractiveness, so has friendship. As we hate solitude and crave society, as nature draws men to each other, so in this matter also there is an attraction which makes us desirous of friendship. 18 Nevertheless, though the sage may love his friends dearly, often comparing them with himself, and putting them ahead of himself, yet all the good will be limited to his own being, and he will speak the words which were spoken by the very Stilbo**[11]** whom Epicurus criticizes in his letter. For Stilbo, after his country was captured and his children and his wife lost, as he emerged from the general desolation alone and yet happy, spoke as follows to Demetrius, called Sacker of Cities because of the destruction he brought upon them, in answer to the question whether he had lost anything: ""I have all my goods with me!"" 19 There is a brave and stout-hearted man for you! The enemy conquered, but Stilbo conquered his conqueror. ""I have lost nothing!"" Aye, he forced Demetrius to wonder whether he himself had conquered after all. ""My goods are all with me!"" In other words, he deemed nothing that might be taken from him to be a good.

We marvel at certain animals because they can pass through fire and suffer no bodily harm; but how much more marvellous is a man who has marched forth unhurt and unscathed through fire and sword and devastation! Do you understand now how much easier it is to conquer a whole tribe than to conquer one man? This saying of Stilbo makes common ground with Stoicism; the Stoic also can carry his goods unimpaired through cities that have been burned to ashes; for he is self-sufficient. Such are the bounds which he sets to his own happiness.

20 But you must not think that our school alone can utter noble words; Epicurus himself, the reviler of Stilbo, spoke similar language;**[12]** put it down to my credit, though I have already wiped out my debt for the present day.**[13]** He says: ""Whoever does not regard what he has as most ample wealth, is unhappy, though he be master of the whole world."" Or, if the following seems to you a more suitable phrase, - for we must try to render the meaning and not the mere words: ""A man may rule the world and still be unhappy, if he does not feel that he is supremely happy."" 21 In order, however, that you may know that these sentiments are universal,**[14]**suggested, of course, by Nature, you will find in one of the comic poets this verse;

    Unblest is he who thinks himself unblest.

**[15]**

or what does your condition matter, if it is bad in your own eyes? 22 You may say; ""What then? If yonder man, rich by base means, and yonder man, lord of many but slave of more, shall call themselves happy, will their own opinion make them happy?"" It matters not what one says, but what one feels; also, not how one feels on one particular day, but how one feels at all times. There is no reason, however, why you should fear that this great privilege will fall into unworthy hands; only the wise man is pleased with his own. Folly is ever troubled with weariness of itself. Farewell.

I do not yet, however, assure myself, or indulge the hope, that there are no elements left in me which need to be changed. Of course there are many that should be made more compact, or made thinner, or be brought into greater prominence. And indeed this very fact is proof that my spirit is altered into something better, - that it can see its own faults, of which it was previously ignorant. In certain cases sick men are congratulated because they themselves have perceived that they are sick.

2 I therefore wish to impart to you this sudden change in myself; I should then begin to place a surer trust in our friendship, - the true friendship which hope and fear and self-interest cannot sever, the friendship in which and for the sake of which men meet death. 3 I can show you many who have lacked, not a friend, but a friendship; this, however, cannot possibly happen when souls are drawn together by identical inclinations into an alliance of honourable desires. And why can it not happen? Because in such cases men know that they have all things in common, especially their troubles.

You cannot conceive what distinct progress I notice that each day brings to me. 4 And when you say: ""Give me also a share in these gifts which you have found so helpful,"" I reply that I am anxious to heap all these privileges upon you, and that I am glad to learn in order that I may teach. Nothing will ever please me, no matter how excellent or beneficial, if I must retain the knowledge of it to myself. And if wisdom were given me under the express condition that it must be kept hidden and not uttered, I should refuse it. No good thing is pleasant to possess, without friends to share it.

5 I shall therefore send to you the actual books; and in order that you may not waste time in searching here and there for profitable topics, I shall mark certain passages, so that you can turn at once to those which I approve and admire. Of course, however, the living voice and the intimacy of a common life will help you more than the written word. You must go to the scene of action, first, because men put more faith in their eyes than in their ears,**[1]** and second, because the way is long if one follows precepts, but short and helpful, if one follows patterns. 6 Cleanthes could not have been the express image of Zeno, if he had merely heard his lectures; he shared in his life, saw into his hidden purposes, and watched him to see whether he lived according to his own rules. Plato, Aristotle, and the whole throng of sages who were destined to go each his different way, derived more benefit from the character than from the words of Socrates. It was not the class-room of Epicurus, but living together under the same roof, that made great men of Metrodorus, Hermarchus, and Polyaenus. Therefore I summon you, not merely that you may derive benefit, but that you may confer benefit; for we can assist each other greatly.

7 Meanwhile, I owe you my little daily contribution; you shall be told what pleased me to-day in the writings of Hecato;**[2]** it is these words: ""What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself."" That was indeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone. You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind. Farewell.

1334948963.0,13,self.Stoicism,sk54t,Contradiction in Stoic Ethical Theory and Physics?,,13,0,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/sk54t/contradiction_in_stoic_ethical_theory_and_physics/,"It seems evident that Stoicism accepts causal determinism/fate and that Zeus (Nature) is responsible for everything that happens.

E.g. *""Conduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,
Wherever your decrees have ﬁxed my lot.
I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,
Wicked and wretched, I must follow still."" -Cleanthes*

and

*""Providence is the source from which all things ﬂow; and allied with it is
Necessity, and the welfare of the universe. You yourself are a part of that
universe; and for any one of nature’s parts, that which is assigned to it by the
World-Nature or helps to keep it in being is good."" -Marcus Aurelius*

So I'm curious if anyone has come to reconcile this aspect of reality with the dichotomy of control? 

Stoic physics seems to suggest that only by will of fate can one be exposed to such a belief system that leads to living in accordance with one's own nature, whereas obviously their ethics rely on ""things in our control"".

This doesn't negate the value of Stoic virtues, but the dichotomy of control seems to vanish.

**edit:**

**For clarity:**

I.e. According to this ontological and cosmological outlook, we have as much control over opinions and judgements as we have control over externals: None. 

In fact it implies there is no difference between ""us"" and ""externals."" That the Whole of Nature, of which everything is a part, in its totality, is the only entity in ""control"" of anything. 

Implying that ""we"" (as expressions of the Whole) come to virtue/eudaimonia necessarily as a result of fate, and of no personal choice.

To suggest that any particular part(s) of the Whole has any autonomous control over anything would subvert the nature of the Whole.

**editedit:**

Thanks to everyone for the replies. I've finally come to understand the logic behind Stoic compatibilism:

Regardless of determinism, our character shapes our actions, thus our character shapes our own character. 

I.e. We are in control of ourselves.

E.g. My character caused me to start studying Stoicism around January which has greatly improved my quality of life--shaping my character towards virtue. My character caused me to shape my own virtue--I shaped my own virtue.

And on the relation of our character to externals I'll quote Epictetus:

""The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.""

I feel I have a much more profound understanding now of what it means to say someone makes themselves a slave to externals.",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,True,,,True,t3_sk54t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/sk54t/contradiction_in_stoic_ethical_theory_and_physics/,

On that day I had to endure the full fate of an athlete; the anointing**[1]** with which we began was followed by the sand-sprinkle in the Naples tunnel.**[2]**

2 No place could be longer than that prison; nothing could be dimmer than those torches, which enabled us, not to see amid the darkness, but to see the darkness. But, even supposing that there was light in the place, the dust, which is an oppressive and disagreeable thing even in the open air, would destroy the light; how much worse the dust is there, where it rolls back upon itself, and, being shut in without ventilation, blows back in the faces of those who set it going! So we endured two inconveniences at the same time, and they were diametrically different: we struggled both with mud and with dust on the same road and on the same day.

3 The gloom, however, furnished me with some food for thought; I felt a certain mental thrill, and a transformation unaccompanied by fear, due to the novelty and the unpleasantness of an unusual occurrence. Of course I am not speaking to you of myself at this point, because I am far from being a perfect person, or even a man of middling qualities; I refer to one over whom fortune has lost her control. Even such a man's mind will be smitten with a thrill and he will change colour. 

4 For there are certain emotions, my dear Lucilius, which no courage can avoid; nature reminds courage how perishable a thing it is. And so he will contract his brow when the prospect is forbidding, will shudder at sudden apparitions, and will become dizzy when he stands at the edge of a high precipice and looks down. This is not fear; it is a natural feeling which reason cannot rout. 

5 That is why certain brave men, most willing to shed their own blood, cannot bear to see the blood of others. Some persons collapse and faint at the sight of a freshly inflicted wound; others are affected similarly on handling or viewing an old wound which is festering. And others meet the sword-stroke more readily than they see it dealt.

6 Accordingly, as I said, I experienced a certain transformation, though it could not be called confusion. Then at the first glimpse of restored daylight my good spirits returned without forethought or command. And I began to muse and think how foolish we are to fear certain objects to a greater or less degree, since all of them end in the same way. For what difference does it make whether a watchtower or a mountain crashes down upon us? No difference at all, you will find. Nevertheless, there will be some men who fear the latter mishap to a greater degree, though both accidents are equally deadly; so true it is that fear looks not to the effect, but to the cause of the effect. 

7 Do you suppose that I am now referring to the Stoics,**[3]** who hold that the soul of a man crushed by a great weight cannot abide, and is scattered forthwith, because it has not had a free opportunity to depart? That is not what I am doing; those who think thus are, in my opinion, wrong. 

8 Just as fire cannot be crushed out, since it will escape round the edges of the body which overwhelms it; just as the air cannot be damaged by lashes and blows, or even cut into, but flows back about the object to which it gives place; similarly the soul, which consists of the subtlest particles, cannot be arrested or destroyed inside the body, but, by virtue of its delicate substance, it will rather escape through the very object by which it is being crushed. Just as lightning, no matter how widely it strikes and flashes, makes its return through a narrow opening,**[4]** so the soul, which is still subtler than fire, has a way of escape through any part of the body. 

9 We therefore come to this question, – whether the soul can be immortal. But be sure of this: if the soul survives the body after the body is crushed, the soul can in no wise be crushed out, precisely because it does not perish; for the rule of immortality never admits of exceptions, and nothing can harm that which is everlasting. Farewell.

Imagine what a variety of noises reverberates about my ears! I have lodgings right over a bathing establishment. So picture to yourself the assortment of sounds, which are strong enough to make me hate my very powers of hearing! When your strenuous gentleman, for example, is exercising himself by flourishing leaden weights; when he is working hard, or else pretends to be working hard, I can hear him grunt; and whenever he releases his imprisoned breath, I can hear him panting in wheezy and high-pitched tones. Or perhaps I notice some lazy fellow, content with a cheap rubdown, and hear the crack of the pummelling hand on his shoulder, varying in sound according as the hand is laid on flat or hollow. Then, perhaps, a professional**[1]** comes along, shouting out the score; that is the finishing touch. 

2 Add to this the arresting of an occasional roisterer or pickpocket, the racket of the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom,**[2]** or the enthusiast who plunges into the swimming-tank with unconscionable noise and splashing. Besides all those whose voices, if nothing else, are good, imagine the hair-plucker with his penetrating, shrill voice, – for purposes of advertisement, – continually giving it vent and never holding his tongue except when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim yell instead. Then the cakeseller with his varied cries, the sausageman, the confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each with his own distinctive intonation.

3 So you say: ""What iron nerves or deadened ears, you must have, if your mind can hold out amid so many noises, so various and so discordant, when our friend Chrysippus**[3]** is brought to his death by the continual good-morrows that greet him!"" But I assure you that this racket means no more to me than the sound of waves or falling water; although you will remind me that a certain tribe once moved their city merely because they could not endure the din of a Nile cataract.**[4]** 

4 Words seem to distract me more than noises; for words demand attention, but noises merely fill the ears and beat upon them. Among the sounds that din round me without distracting, I include passing carriages, a machinist in the same block, a saw-sharpener near by, or some fellow who is demonstrating with little pipes and flutes at the Trickling Fountain,**[5]** shouting rather than singing.

5 Furthermore, an intermittent noise upsets me more than a steady one. But by this time I have toughened my nerves against all that sort of thing, so that I can endure even a boatswain marking the time in high-pitched tones for his crew. For I force my mind to concentrate, and keep it from straying to things outside itself; all outdoors may be bedlam, provided that there is no disturbance within, provided that fear is not wrangling with desire in my breast, provided that meanness and lavishness are not at odds, one harassing the other. For of what benefit is a quiet neighbourhood, if our emotions are in an uproar?

6 *'Twas night, and all the world was lulled to rest*.**[6]**

This is not true; for no real rest can be found when reason has not done the lulling. Night brings our troubles to the light, rather than banishes them; it merely changes the form of our worries. For even when we seek slumber, our sleepless moments are as harassing as the daytime. Real tranquillity is the state reached by an unperverted mind when it is relaxed. 

7 Think of the unfortunate man who courts sleep by surrendering his spacious mansion to silence, who, that his ear may be disturbed by no sound, bids the whole retinue of his slaves be quiet and that whoever approaches him shall walk on tiptoe; he tosses from this side to that and seeks a fitful slumber amid his frettings! 

8 He complains that he has heard sounds, when he has not heard them at all. The reason, you ask? His soul's in an uproar; it must be soothed, and its rebellious murmuring checked. You need not suppose that the soul is at peace when the body is still. Sometimes quiet means disquiet.

We must therefore rouse ourselves to action and busy ourselves with interests that are good, as often as we are in the grasp of an uncontrollable sluggishness. 

9 Great generals, when they see that their men are mutinous, check them by some sort of labour or keep them busy with small forays. The much occupied man has no time for wantonness, and it is an obvious commonplace that the evils of leisure can be shaken off by hard work. Although people may often have thought that I sought seclusion because I was disgusted with politics and regretted my hapless and thankless position,**[7]** yet, in the retreat to which apprehension and weariness have driven me, my ambition sometimes develops afresh. For it is not because my ambition was rooted out that it has abated, but because it was wearied or perhaps even put out of temper by the failure of its plans. 

10 And so with luxury, also, which sometimes seems to have departed, and then when we have made a profession of frugality, begins to fret us and, amid our economies, seeks the pleasures which we have merely left but not condemned. Indeed, the more stealthily it comes, the greater is its force. For all unconcealed vices are less serious; a disease also is farther on the road to being cured when it breaks forth from concealment and manifests its power. So with greed, ambition, and the other evils of the mind, – you may be sure that they do most harm when they are hidden behind a pretence of soundness.

11 Men think that we are in retirement, and yet we are not. For if we have sincerely retired, and have sounded the signal for retreat, and have scorned outward attractions, then, as I remarked above,**[8]** no outward thing will distract us; no music of men or of birds**[9]** can interrupt good thoughts, when they have once become steadfast and sure. 

12 The mind which starts at words or at chance sounds is unstable and has not yet withdrawn into itself; it contains within itself an element of anxiety and rooted fear, and this makes one a prey to care, as our Vergil says:


*I, whom of yore no dart could cause to flee*,

*Nor Greeks, with crowded lines of infantry*.

*Now shake at every sound, and fear the air*,

*Both for my child and for the load I bear*. **[10]**


13 This man in his first state is wise; he blenches neither at the brandished spear, nor at the clashing armour of the serried foe, nor at the din of the stricken city. This man in his second state lacks knowledge fearing for his own concerns, he pales at every sound; any cry is taken for the battle-shout and overthrows him; the slightest disturbance renders him breathless with fear. It is the load that makes him afraid.**[11]**

14 Select anyone you please from among your favourites of Fortune, trailing their many responsibilities, carrying their many burdens, and you will behold a picture of Vergil's hero, ""fearing both for his child and for the load he bears.""

You may therefore be sure that you are at peace with yourself, when no noise readies you, when no word shakes you out of yourself, whether it be of flattery or of threat, or merely an empty sound buzzing about you with unmeaning din. 

15 ""What then?"" you say, ""is it not sometimes a simpler matter just to avoid the uproar?"" I admit this. Accordingly, I shall change from my present quarters. I merely wished to test myself and to give myself practice. Why need I be tormented any longer, when Ulysses found so simple a cure for his comrades**[12]** even against the songs of the Sirens? Farewell.

I know that Stoicism can be applied equally well to both worldviews, but I suspect it's more popular among atheists.

Please let me know your religious views, and answer the appropriate questions if you will.

For atheist Stoics, how do you interpret passages in Stoic literature that insist that you profess that the gods exist (Marcus Aurelius)? Or that cite the gods as evidence for their arguments? And how do you view externals; as things that unfold with a plan, or things that simply unfold exactly as they unfold?

For Christian Stoics, do you find any contradictions between Stoicism and your Christianity? If so, which takes precedence? Do you think Stoic concepts are imbedded in Christianity? (not vice versa, Stoicism came first)

Myself, I'm an atheist Stoic, and I mentally replace 'gods' in the literature with 'nature' (as it is in some translations). But I don't feel like I deify nature in that sense, I remember that if something is outside of my control, it should be nothing to be.

Do not, however, deem yourself truly happy until you find that you can live before men's eyes, until your walls protect but do not hide you; although we are apt to believe that these walls surround us, not to enable us to live more safely, but that we may sin more secretly. 4. I shall mention a fact by which you may weigh the worth of a man's character: you will scarcely find anyone who can live with his door wide open. It is our conscience, not our pride, that has put doorkeepers at our doors; we live in such a fashion that being suddenly disclosed to view is equivalent to being caught in the act. What profits it, however, to hide ourselves away, and to avoid the eyes and ears of men? 5. A good conscience welcomes the crowd, but a bad conscience, even in solitude, is disturbed and troubled. If your deeds are honourable, let everybody know them; if base, what matters it that no one knows them, as long as you yourself know them? How wretched you are if you despise such a witness! Farewell.

We do not need to uplift our hands towards heaven, or to beg the keeper of a temple to let us approach his idol's ear, as if in this way our prayers were more likely to be heard. God is near you, he is with you, he is within you. 2. This is what I mean, Lucilius: a holy spirit indwells within us, one who marks our good and bad deeds, and is our guardian. As we treat this spirit, so are we treated by it. Indeed, no man can be good without the help of God. Can one rise superior to fortune unless God helps him to rise? He it is that gives noble and upright counsel. In each good man

*A god doth dwell, but what god know we not*.**[1]**

3 If ever you have come upon a grove that is full of ancient trees which have grown to an unusual height, shutting out a view of the sky by a veil of pleached and intertwining branches, then the loftiness of the forest, the seclusion of the spot, and your marvel at the thick unbroken shade in the midst of the open spaces, will prove to you the presence of deity. Or if a cave, made by the deep crumbling of the rocks, holds up a mountain on its arch, a place not built with hands but hollowed out into such spaciousness by natural causes, your soul will be deeply moved by a certain intimation of the existence of God. We worship the sources of mighty rivers; we erect altars at places where great streams burst suddenly from hidden sources; we adore springs of hot water as divine, and consecrate certain pools because of their dark waters or their immeasurable depth. 4. If you see a man who is unterrified in the midst of dangers, untouched by desires, happy in adversity, peaceful amid the storm, who looks down upon men from a higher plane, and views the gods on a footing of equality, will not a feeling of reverence for him steal over you, will you not say: ""This quality is too great and too lofty to be regarded as resembling this petty body in which it dwells? A divine power has descended upon that man."" 5. When a soul rises superior to other souls, when it is under control, when it passes through every experience as if it were of small account, when it smiles at our fears and at our prayers, it is stirred by a force from heaven. A thing like this cannot stand upright unless it be propped by the divine. Therefore, a greater part of it abides in that place from whence it came down to earth. Just as the rays of the sun do indeed touch the earth, but still abide at the source from which they are sent; even so the great and hallowed soul, which has come down in order that we may have a nearer knowledge of divinity, does indeed associate with us, but still cleaves to its origin; on that source it depends, thither it turns its gaze and strives to go, and it concerns itself with our doings only as a being superior to ourselves.

6 What, then, is such a soul? One which is resplendent with no external good, but only with its own. For what is more foolish than to praise in a man the qualities which come from without? And what is more insane than to marvel at characteristics which may at the next instant be passed on to someone else? A golden bit does not make a better horse. The lion with gilded mane, in process of being trained and forced by weariness to endure the decoration, is sent into the arena in quite a different way from the wild lion whose spirit is unbroken; the latter, indeed, bold in his attack, as nature wished him to be, impressive because of his wild appearance, – and it is his glory that none can look upon him without fear, – is favoured**[2]** in preference to the other lion, that languid and gilded brute.

7 No man ought to glory except in that which is his own. We praise a vine if it makes the shoots teem with increase, if by its weight it bends to the ground the very poles which hold its fruit; would any man prefer to this vine one from which golden grapes and golden leaves hang down? In a vine the virtue peculiarly its own is fertility; in man also we should praise that which is his own. Suppose that he has a retinue of comely slaves and a beautiful house, that his farm is large and large his income; none of these things is in the man himself; they are all on the outside. 8. Praise the quality in him which cannot be given or snatched away, that which is the peculiar property of the man. Do you ask what this is? It is soul, and reason brought to perfection in the soul. For man is a reasoning animal. Therefore, man's highest good is attained, if he has fulfilled the good for which nature designed him at birth. 9. And what is it which this reason demands of him? The easiest thing in the world, – to live in accordance with his own nature. But this is turned into a hard task by the general madness of mankind; we push one another into vice. And how can a man be recalled to salvation, when he has none to restrain him, and all mankind to urge him on? Farewell.

You cannot deceive me; for I am with you. Live just as if I were sure to get news of your doings, nay, as if I were sure to behold them. And if you wonder what particularly pleases me that I hear concerning you, it is that I hear nothing, that most of those whom I ask do not know what you are doing.

2 This is sound practice – to refrain from associating with men of different stamp and different aims. And I am indeed confident that you cannot be warped, that you will stick to your purpose, even though the crowd may surround and seek to distract you. What, then, is on my mind? I am not afraid lest they work a change in you; but I am afraid lest they may hinder your progress. And much harm is done even by one who holds you back, especially since life is so short; and we make it still shorter by our unsteadiness, by making ever fresh beginnings at life, now one and immediately another. We break up life into little bits, and fritter it away. 3. Hasten ahead, then, dearest Lucilius, and reflect how greatly you would quicken your speed if an enemy were at your back, or if you suspected the cavalry were approaching and pressing hard upon your steps as you fled. It is true; the enemy is indeed pressing upon you; you should therefore increase your speed and escape away and reach a safe position, remembering continually what a noble thing it is to round out your life before death comes, and then await in peace the remaining portion of your time, claiming**[1]** nothing for yourself, since you are in possession of the happy life; for such a life is not made happier for being longer. 4. O when shall you see the time when you shall know that time means nothing to you, when you shall be peaceful and calm, careless of the morrow, because you are enjoying your life to the full?

Would you know what makes men greedy for the future? It is because no one has yet found himself. Your parents, to be sure, asked other blessings for you; but I myself pray rather that you may despise all those things which your parents wished for you in abundance. Their prayers plunder many another person, simply that you may be enriched. Whatever they make over to you must be removed from someone else. 5. I pray that you may get such control over yourself that your mind, now shaken by wandering thoughts, may at last come to rest and be steadfast, that it may be content with itself and, having attained an understanding of what things are truly good, – and they are in our possession as soon as we have this knowledge, – that it may have no need of added years. He has at length passed beyond all necessities – he has won his honourable discharge and is free, – who still lives after his life has been completed. Farewell.

Have you run into trouble because of our philosophy?,thmz,19,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/15y3tn/stoic_problems_have_you_run_into_trouble_because/,"I discovered stoicism a week ago, but like many of you, I wound up on it's path by myself. 

The number one problem I've run into is my tranquility and coldness. I've never gotten angry about things a normal person would. For example, if I just barely missed the bus, I'd just to ""damn"" and wait for the next one. For numerous times I've had to fake anger to my friends.  Yeah. Fake anger. Why? Because otherwise my friends thought something that happened made me so angry that I can't even talk about it, when in reality, I'm more disappointed or indifferent about the thing that happened. 

Te other problem is my ""coldness"" or my ability to zero out my emotions. I've started to fall for a few women in my life, and after I gave us being together a thought, I could very easily shift my interest in a totally different woman because she would be much better for me and I for her. I also make emotionless decisions. This in itself isn't a problem, but I gave people emotionless advice too. Then I'd be disappointed they didn't follow my advice and things turned much worse for them.

Vernon Arnold, after a discussion of the greatly divergent contemporary (to him, in 1911) estimates of the worth of Stoicism:

&gt; Judgments so contradictory reveal the fact that ancient divergencies of philosophic sympathies have their counterparts today; and perhaps in studying and judging the systems of antiquity a little more is needed of the sympathy and interpretative elasticity which every man unconsciously uses in maintaining the political, philosophic and religious views to which he is attracted by inheritance or personal conviction. Thus to understand Stoicism fully a man must himself become for the time being a Stoic. As such he will no longer bind himself by the letter of the school authorities.  In many a phrase they use he will recognise an obsolete habit  of thought, an exaggerated opposition, a weak compliance in the face of dominant opinions, or a mistaken reliance upon what  once seemed logical conclusions. At other points he will see difficulties felt to which an answer can now easily be supplied.  At each step he will ask, not so much what the Stoics thought,  but what a Stoic must necessarily think. Whilst constantly referring to the original authorities, he will allow much to be forgotten, and in other cases he will draw out more meaning than the writers themselves set in their words. If he can walk, boldly but not without caution, on this path, he will assuredly find that Stoicism throws light on all the great questions to which men still seek answers, and that to some at least it still holds out a beckoning hand.

I do not maintain that the body is not to be indulged at all; but I maintain that we must not be slaves to it. He will have many masters who makes his body his master, who is over-fearful in its behalf, who judges everything according to the body. 2. We should conduct ourselves not as if we ought to live for the body, but as if we could not live without it. Our too great love for it makes us restless with fears, burdens us with cares, and exposes us to insults. Virtue is held too cheap by the man who counts his body too dear. We should cherish the body with the greatest care; but we should also be prepared, when reason, self-respect, and duty demand the sacrifice, to deliver it even to the flames.

3 Let us, however, in so far as we can, avoid discomforts as well as dangers, and withdraw to safe ground, by thinking continually how we may repel all objects of fear. If I am not mistaken, there are three main classes of these: we fear want, we fear sickness, and we fear the troubles which result from the violence of the stronger. 4. And of all these, that which shakes us most is the dread which hangs over us from our neighbour's ascendancy; for it is accompanied by great outcry and uproar. But the natural evils which I have mentioned, - want and sickness, steal upon us silently with no shock of terror to the eye or to the ear. The other kind of evil comes, so to speak, in the form of a huge parade. Surrounding it is a retinue of swords and fire and chains and a mob of beasts to be let loose upon the disembowelled entrails of men. 5. Picture to yourself under this head the prison, the cross, the rack, the hook, and the stake which they drive straight through a man until it protrudes from his throat. Think of human limbs torn apart by chariots driven in opposite directions, of the terrible shirt smeared and interwoven with inflammable materials, and of all the other contrivances devised by cruelty, in addition to those which I have mentioned!**[1]** 6. It is not surprising, then, if our greatest terror is of such a fate; for it comes in many shapes and its paraphernalia are terrifying. For just as the torturer accomplishes more in proportion to the number of instruments which he displays, - indeed, the spectacle overcomes those who would have patiently withstood the suffering, - similarly, of all the agencies which coerce and master our minds, the most effective are those which can make a display. Those other troubles are of course not less serious; I mean hunger, thirst, ulcers of the stomach, and fever that parches our very bowels. They are, however, secret; they have no bluster and no heralding; but these, like huge arrays of war, prevail by virtue of their display and their equipment.

7 Let us, therefore, see to it that we abstain from giving offence. It is sometimes the people that we ought to fear; or sometimes a body of influential oligarchs in the Senate, if the method of governing the State is such that most of the business is done by that body; and sometimes individuals equipped with power by the people and against the people. It is burdensome to keep the friendship of all such persons; it is enough not to make enemies of them. So the wise man will never provoke the anger of those in power; nay, he will even turn his course, precisely as he would turn from a storm if he were steering a ship. 8. When you travelled to Sicily, you crossed the Straits. The reckless pilot scorned the blustering South Wind, - the wind which roughens the Sicilian Sea and forces it into choppy currents; he sought not the shore on the left,**[2]** but the strand hard by the place where Charybdis throws the seas into confusion. Your more careful pilot, however, questions those who know the locality as to the tides and the meaning of the clouds; he holds his course far from that region notorious for its swirling waters. Our wise man does the same he shuns a strong man who may be injurious to him, making a point of not seeming to avoid him, because an important part of one's safety lies in not seeking safety openly; for what one avoids, one condemns,

9 We should therefore look about us, and see how we may protect ourselves from the mob. And first of all, we should have no cravings like theirs; for rivalry results in strife. Again, let us possess nothing that can be snatched from us to the great profit of a plotting foe. Let there be as little booty as possible on your person. No one sets out to shed the blood of his fellow-men for the sake of bloodshed, - at any rate very few. More murderers speculate on their profits than give vent to hatred. If you are empty-handed, the highwayman passes you by: even along an infested road, the poor may travel in peace.**[3]** 10. Next, we must follow the old adage and avoid three things with special care: hatred, jealousy, and scorn. And wisdom alone can show you how this may be done. It is hard to observe a mean; we must be chary of letting the fear of jealousy lead us into becoming objects of scorn, lest, when we choose not to stamp others down, we let them think that they can stamp us down. The power to inspire fear has caused many men to be in fear.**[4]** Let us withdraw ourselves in every way; for it is as harmful to be scorned as to be admired.

11 One must therefore take refuge in philosophy; this pursuit, not only in the eyes of good men, but also in the eyes of those who are even moderately bad, is a sort of protecting emblem.**[5]** For speechmaking at the bar, or any other pursuit that claims the people's attention, wins enemies for a man; but philosophy is peaceful and minds her own business. Men cannot scorn her; she is honoured by every profession, even the vilest among them. Evil can never grow so strong, and nobility of character can never be so plotted against, that the name of philosophy shall cease to be worshipful and sacred.

Philosophy itself, however should be practised with calmness and moderation. 12. ""Very well, then,"" you retort, ""do you regard the philosophy of Marcus Cato as moderate? Cato's voice strove to check a civil war. Cato parted the swords of maddened chieftains. When some fell foul of Pompey and others fell foul of Caesar, Cato defied both parties at once!"" 13. Nevertheless, one may well question whether, in those days, a wise man ought to have taken any part in public affairs, and ask: ""What do you mean, Marcus Cato? It is not now a question of freedom; long since has freedom gone to rack and ruin. The question is, whether it is Caesar or Pompey who controls the State. Why, Cato, should you take sides in that dispute? It is no business of yours; a tyrant is being selected. What does it concern you who conquers? The better man may win; but the winner is bound to be the worse man.""**[6]** I have referred to Cato's final rôle. But even in previous years the wise man was not permitted to intervene in such plundering of the state; for what could Cato do but raise his voice and utter unavailing words? At one time he was ""bustled"" by the mob and spat upon and forcibly removed from the forum and marked for exile; at another, he was taken straight to prison from the senate-chamber.

14 However, we shall consider later**[7]** whether the wise man ought to give his attention to politics; meanwhile, I beg you to consider those Stoics who, shut out from public life, have withdrawn into privacy for the purpose of improving men's existence and framing laws for the human race without incurring the displeasure of those in power. The wise man will not upset the customs of the people, nor will he invite the attention of the populace by any novel ways of living.

15 ""What then? Can one who follows out this Plan be safe in any case?"" I cannot guarantee you this any more than I can guarantee good health in the case of a man who observes moderation; although, as a matter of fact, good health results from such moderation. Sometimes a vessel perishes in harbour; but what do you think happens on the open sea? And how much more beset with danger that man would be, who even in his leisure is not secure, if he were busily working at many things! Innocent persons sometimes perish; who would deny that? But the guilty perish more frequently. A soldier's skill is not at fault if he receives the death-blow through his armour. 16. And finally, the wise man regards the reason for all his actions, but not the results. The beginning is in our own power; fortune decides the issue, but I do not allow her to pass sentence upon myself. You may say: ""But she can inflict a measure of suffering and of trouble."" The highwayman does not pass sentence when he slays.

17 Now you are stretching forth your hand for the daily gift. Golden indeed will be the gift with which I shall load you; and, inasmuch as we have mentioned gold, let me tell you how its use and enjoyment may bring you greater pleasure. ""He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most.""**[8]** ""Author's name, please!"" you say. Now, to show you how generous I am, it is my intent to praise the dicta of other schools. The phrase belongs to Epicurus, or Metrodorus, or some one of that particular thinking-shop. 18. But what difference does it make who spoke the words? They were uttered for the world. He who craves riches feels fear on their account. No man, however, enjoys a blessing that brings anxiety; he is always trying to add a little more. While he puzzles over increasing his wealth, he forgets how to use it. He collects his accounts, he wears out the pavement in the forum, he turns over his ledger,**[9]** - in short, he ceases to be master and becomes a steward. Farewell.

1351021547.0,12,self.Stoicism,11yoik,"On the terrors of death - Seneca, Letter 4",ThatsOK,12,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/11yoik/on_the_terrors_of_death_seneca_letter_4/,"1 Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines. 2 You remember, of course, what joy you felt when you laid aside the garments of boyhood and donned the man's toga, and were escorted to the forum; nevertheless, you may look for a still greater joy when you have laid aside the mind of boyhood and when wisdom has enrolled you among men. For it is not boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, - boyishness. And this condition is all the more serious because we possess the authority of old age, together with the follies of boyhood, yea, even the follies of infancy. Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear both.

3 All you need to do is to advance; you will thus understand that some things are less to be dreaded, precisely because they inspire us with great fear. No evil is great which is the last evil of all. Death arrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could remain with you. But death must either not come at all, or else must come and pass away.

4 ""It is difficult, however,"" you say, ""to bring the mind to a point where it can scorn life."" But do you not see what trifling reasons impel men to scorn life? One hangs himself before the door of his mistress; another hurls himself from the house-top that he may no longer be compelled to bear the taunts of a bad-tempered master; a third, to be saved from arrest after running away, drives a sword into his vitals. Do you not suppose that virtue will be as efficacious as excessive fear? No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or believes that living through many consulships is a great blessing. 5 Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart from life contentedly; for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks.

Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die. 6 For this reason, make life as a whole agreeable to yourself by banishing all worry about it. No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than that which, when lost, cannot be missed. Therefore, encourage and toughen your spirit against the mishaps that afflict even the most powerful. 7 For example, the fate of Pompey was settled by a boy and a eunuch, that of Crassus by a cruel and insolent Parthian. Gaius Caesar ordered Lepidus to bare his neck for the axe of the tribune Dexter; and he himself offered his own throat to Chaerea.**[1]** No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him. Do not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed. 8 Reflect that a highwayman or an enemy may cut your throat; and, though he is not your master, every slave wields the power of life and death over you. Therefore I declare to you: he is lord of your life that scorns his own. Think of those who have perished through plots in their own home, slain either openly or by guile; you will that just as many have been killed by angry slaves as by angry kings. What matter, therefore, how powerful he be whom you fear, when every one possesses the power which inspires your fear? 9 ""But,"" you will say, ""if you should chance to fall into the hands of the enemy, the conqueror will command that you be led away,"" - yes, whither you are already being led.**[2]** Why do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is that you have long been labouring under? Take my word for it: since the day you were born you are being led thither. We must ponder this thought, and thoughts of the like nature, if we desire to be calm as we await that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.

10 But I must end my letter. Let me share with you the saying which pleased me to-day. It, too, is culled from another man's Garden:**[3]** ""Poverty brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth."" Do you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. In order to banish hunger and thirst, it is not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the purse-proud, or to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor is it necessary for you to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature's needs are easily provided and ready to hand. 11 It is the superfluous things for which men sweat, - the superfluous things that wear our togas threadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores. That which is enough is ready to our hands. He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich. Farewell.

I've shared a few excerpts from the book below, do take a look if you have the time to spare:

&gt;If virtue is really the sole good, a beneficent Providence must be solely concerned to cause virtue, yet the laws of Nature have produced abundance of sinners. If virtue is the sole good, there can be no reason against cruelty and injustice, since, as the Stoics are never tired of pointing out, cruelty and injustice afford the sufferer the best opportunities for the exercise of virtue. If the world is completely deterministic, natural laws will decide whether I shall be virtuous or not. **If I am wicked, Nature compels me to be wicked, and the freedom which virtue is supposed to give is not possible for me**.  - pg 262-263

-

&gt; Although as a Stoic, Seneca officially despised riches, he amassed a huge fortune, amounting it said was said to three hundred million sesterces (about three million pounds). Much of this he acquired by lending money in Britain; according to Dio, the excessive rates of interest that he exacted were among the causes of revolt in that country. ... [Seneca] was judged, in future ages, rather by his admirable precepts than by his somewhat dubious practice. - pg 267

-

&gt;[Marcus Aurelius] persecuted the Christians, because they rejected the State religion, which he considered politically necessary. In all his actions he was conscientious, but in most he was unsuccessful. He is a pathetic figure : in a list of mundane desires to be resisted, the one that he finds most seductive is the wish to retire to a quiet country life. - pg 268

-

&gt;Marcus Aurelius is persuaded that God gives every man a special daemon as his guide - a belief which reappears in the Christian guardian angel. - pg 272
 
-

&gt; ... We all know, as a matter if empirical fact, that dyspepsia, for example, has a bad effect on a man's virtue, and that, by suitable drugs forcibly administered, will-power can be destroyed. Take Epictetus's favourite case, the man unjustly imprisoned by tyrant, of which there have been more examples in recent history than at any other period in human history. Some of these men have acted with Stoic heroism; some, rather mysteriously, have not. It has become clear, not only that sufficient torture will break down almost any man's fortitude, but also that morphia or cocaine can reduce a man to docility. The will, in fact, is only independent of the tyrant so long as the tyrant is unscientific. - pg 273

Here's the first one : *That there is no need of giving many proofs for one problem*



Once when discussion turned upon proofs or demonstrations, such as beginners must learn from their teachers of philosophy in gaining a mastery of whatever they are studying, Musonius said that there was no sense in seeking many proofs for each point, but rather cogent and lucid ones. Thus just as the physician who prescribes many drugs for his patients deserves less praise than the one who succeeds in helping them with a few, so the philosopher who teaches his pupils with the use of many proofs is less effective than the one who leads them to the desired goal with few. And the pupil too, the quicker his intelligence, the fewer proofs he will require, and the sooner he will assent to the conclusion of the argument in question, provided it be sound. But those who require proofs at every point, even where the matter is perfectly clear, or demand to have demonstrated at length things which could be explained briefly are completely inept and dull-witted.



The gods, we may assume, need no proof of anything inasmuch as nothing to them lacks clearness or is obscure, and it is only in reference to obscurity that there is any need of proof. Man, however, must needs seek to find out that which is not plain nor self-evident through the medium of the plain and obvious. That is the function of proof. Take for example the proposition that pleasure is not a good. At first sight we do not recognize it as true, since in fact pleasure appeals to us as a good. But starting from the generally accepted premise that every good is desirable and adding to it a second equally accepted that some pleasures are not desirable, we succeed in proving that pleasure is not a good: that is we prove the unknown or unrecognized by means of the known or recognized. Or again, that toil is not an evil is not on the face of it a persuasive proposition, while its opposite, that toil is an evil, seems much more persuasive. But starting from the known and accepted premise that every evil is a thing to be avoided, and adding to it another obvious one, namely that many forms of toil are not in the category of things to be avoided, we conclude that toil is not an evil. Since this, then, is the nature of proof, when we consider that some men are quicker of wit and others duller, that some are reared in better environment, others in worse, those of the latter class being inferior in character and native disposition will require more proofs and more diligent attention to be led to master the teachings in question and to be moulded by them; just as defective physiques, when the goal is to restore perfect health, require very diligent and prolonged treatment. On the other hand such pupils as are of a finer nature and have enjoyed better training will more easily and more quickly, and with few proofs, assent to sound reasoning and put it into practice. How true this is we may readily recognize if we chance to know two lads or young men, of whom one has been reared in luxury, his body effeminate, his spirit weakened by soft living, and having besides a dull and torpid disposition; the other reared somewhat in the Spartan manner, unaccustomed to luxury, practiced in self-restraint, and ready to listen to sound reasoning. If then we place these two young men in the position of pupils of a philosopher arguing that death, toil, poverty, and the like are not evils, or again that life, pleasure, wealth, and the like are not goods, do you imagine that both will give heed to the argument in the same fashion, and that one will be persuaded by it in the same degree as the other? Far from it. The one reluctantly and slowly, and fairly pried loose by a thousand arguments, will perhaps in the end give sign of assent—I mean of course the dullard. The other quickly and readily will accept the argument as cogent and relevant to himself, and will not require many proofs nor a fuller treatment. Was not just such a lad that Spartan boy who asked Cleanthes the philosopher if toil was not a good?[1] He made it plain that he was so well-endowed by nature and by training for the practice of virtue as to consider toil closer to the nature of good than of evil, in that he asked whether toil was not perchance a good, as if it were conceded that it was not an evil. Thereupon Cleanthes in surprise and admiration of the boy replied, ""Thou art of noble blood, dear child, so noble the words thou speakest.""[2] Can you doubt that such a lad would have been readily persuaded not to fear poverty nor death nor any of the things which seem terrible, and again, not to seek after wealth nor life nor pleasure?



To come back to the starting point of my discussion, I repeat that it is mistaken zeal for the teacher, if he be a true philosopher, to rehearse a multitude of arguments and proofs to his pupils. He should rather touch upon each one with just measure, seek to penetrate to the very intellect of his hearer, and present persuasive arguments and such as cannot easily be refuted. But most of all his treatment should consist in showing himself not only as one who utters words which are most helpful, but as one who acts consistently with them. As for the pupil, it is his duty to attend diligently to what is said and to be on his guard lest he accept unwittingly something false. But of what he accepts as truth, his effort should not be directed toward learning numbers of proofs—far from it—but only such as are plain and lucid. Finally whatever precepts enjoined upon him he is persuaded are true, these must he follow out in his daily life. For only in this way will philosophy be of profit to anyone, if to sound teaching he adds conduct in harmony with it.

""If one accomplishes some good though with toil, the toil passes, but the good remains; if one does something dishonorable with pleasure, the pleasure passes, but the dishonor remains.""

Afterwards I read that same sentiment in a speech of Cato's which was delivered at Numantia to the knights. Although it is expressed a little less compactly and concisely as compared with the Greek which I have quoted, yet because it is earlier and more ancient, it may well seem more impressive. The words from his speech are the following: ""Consider this in your hearts: if you accomplish some good attended with toil, the toil will quickly leave you; but if you do some evil attended with pleasure, the pleasure will quickly pass away, but the bad deed will remain with you always.""[1]

It seems to me that Stoicism is a philosophy of character (= dealing with representations and emotions) rather than a philosophy of action (however, action can be the product of reason).

Stoics teach us to not care about externals : the only thing that matters is reason. It's stupid to search for glory or money, because they don't hing upon our freedom, they hinge upon destiny/causality/nature. Then why shall we fulfill our family or civic duties (for example), since they are externals too? Don't mistake me, I don't say that we shouldn't (I think I shoud, as I [explained](http://fr.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/rmphw/virtuousness_question/c474xh0)). But I have the impression than mere Stoicism doesn't have an answer (apart from being able to chose without being troubled by emotions).

Here's another example:

* (A): some dude stole me my money --&gt; ok, he did it for X reason, it's the law of nature, I can't do anything. Here, I understand the Stoic position.

* (B): I learn that some dude **will** try to steal my money --&gt; one answer could be : ""why try to prevent it? it's a law of nature bla bla"". Or is it rather: ""I'll hide my money to prevent stealing because I need it for X reason. However, if the dude succeed in stealing it, well it's not a problem : back to (A) --&gt; I can try to prevent the stealing without being troubled by fear"". This second option imply that with Stoicism you learn to deal with representations and emotions, but the choice of action hinge upon you and your reason. But I'm back to my first interrogation : **why some choice is better than another, since the result is an external?**

Ok, my post looks like a huge fucking mess and it looks stupid, but I think you've understood my interrogation. So what do you think, fellas?

And it is only recently that I clicked on the links in the sidebar which lead me to /r/Stoicism.

I had heard the word stoic before but never really knew what it meant – other than someone who is not happy.  So I decided to do a little reading on the subject.

At first I was confused as it seemed a lot like asceticism, but as I continued reading I think I began to see a difference.

Being very new to both philosophies, here is how I (a newb) currently see the difference.

Here is how each would answer the question, “Why did you do that?”

Ascetic: “Because I care.”

Stoic, “Because I don’t care.”

1369334050.0,10,self.Stoicism,1ex32u,"On Baiae and morals - Seneca, Letter 51",ThatsOK,10,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1ex32u/on_baiae_and_morals_seneca_letter_51/,"1 Every man does the best he can, my dear Lucilius! You over there have Etna,**[1]** that lofty and most celebrated mountain of Sicily; (although I cannot make out why Messala, – or was it Valgius? for I have been reading in both, – has called it ""unique,"" inasmuch as many regions belch forth fire, not merely the lofty ones where the phenomenon is more frequent, – presumably because fire rises to the greatest possible height, – but low-lying places also.) As for myself, I do the best I can; I have had to be satisfied with Baiae;**[2]** and I left it the day after I reached it; for Baiae is a place to be avoided, because, though it has certain natural advantages, luxury has claimed it for her own exclusive resort. 

2 ""What then,"" you say, ""should any place be singled out as an object of aversion?"" Not at all. But just as, to the wise and upright man, one style of clothing is more suitable than another, without his having an aversion for any particular colour, but because he thinks that some colours do not befit one who has adopted the simple life; so there are places also, which the wise man or he who is on the way toward wisdom will avoid as foreign to good morals. 

3 Therefore, if he is contemplating withdrawal from the world, he will not select Canopus**[3]** (although Canopus does not keep any man from living simply), nor Baiae either; for both places have begun to be resorts of vice. At Canopus luxury pampers itself to the utmost degree; at Baiae it is even more lax, as if the place itself demanded a certain amount of licence.

4 We ought to select abodes which are wholesome not only for the body but also for the character. Just as I do not care to live in a place of torture, neither do I care to live in a cafe. To witness persons wandering drunk along the beach, the riotous revelling of sailing parties, the lakes a-din with choral**[4]** song, and all the other ways in which luxury, when it is, so to speak, released from the restraints of law not merely sins, but blazons its sins abroad, – why must I witness all this? 

5 We ought to see to it that we flee to the greatest possible distance from provocations to vice. We should toughen our minds, and remove them far from the allurements of pleasure. A single winter relaxed Hannibal's fibre; his pampering in Campania took the vigour out of that hero who had triumphed over Alpine snows. He conquered with his weapons, but was conquered by his vices. 

6 We too have a war to wage, a type of warfare in which there is allowed no rest or furlough. To be conquered, in the first place, are pleasures, which, as you see, have carried off even the sternest characters. If a man has once understood how great is the task which he has entered upon, he will see that there must be no dainty or effeminate conduct. What have I to do with those hot baths or with the sweating-room where they shut in the dry steam which is to drain your strength? Perspiration should flow only after toil.

7 Suppose we do what Hannibal did, – check the course of events, give up the war, and give over our bodies to be coddled. Every one would rightly blame us for our untimely sloth, a thing fraught with peril even for the victor, to say nothing of one who is only on the way to victory. And we have even less right to do this than those followers of the Carthaginian flag; for our danger is greater than theirs if we slacken, and our toil is greater than theirs even if we press ahead. 

8 Fortune is fighting against me, and I shall not carry out her commands. I refuse to submit to the yoke; nay rather, I shake off the yoke that is upon me, – an act which demands even greater courage. The soul is not to be pampered; surrendering to pleasure means also surrendering to pain, surrendering to toil, surrendering to poverty. Both ambition and anger will wish to have the same rights over me as pleasure, and I shall be torn asunder, or rather pulled to pieces, amid all these conflicting passions. 

9 I have set freedom before my eyes; and I am striving for that reward. And what is freedom, you ask? It means not being a slave to any circumstance, to any constraint, to any chance; it means compelling Fortune to enter the lists on equal terms. And on the day when I know that I have the upper hand, her power will be naught. When I have death in my own control, shall I take orders from her?

10 Therefore, a man occupied with such reflections should choose an austere and pure dwelling-place. The spirit is weakened by surroundings that are too pleasant, and without a doubt one's place of residence can contribute towards impairing its vigour. Animals whose hoofs are hardened on rough ground can travel any road; but when they are fattened on soft marshy meadows their hoofs are soon worn out. The bravest soldier comes from rock-ribbed regions; but the town-bred and the home-bred are sluggish in action. The hand which turns from the plough to the sword never objects to toil; but your sleek and well-dressed dandy quails at the first cloud of dust. 

11 Being trained in a rugged country strengthens the character and fits it for great undertakings. It was more honourable in Scipio to spend his exile at Liternum,**[5]** than at Baiae; his downfall did not need a setting so effeminate. Those also into whose hands the rising fortunes of Rome first transferred the wealth of the state, Gaius Marius, Gnaeus Pompey, and Caesar, did indeed build villas near Baiae; but they set them on the very tops of the mountains. This seemed more soldier-like, to look down from a lofty height upon lands spread far and wide below. Note the situation, position, and type of building which they chose; you will see that they were not country-places, – they were camps. 

12 Do you suppose that Cato would ever have dwelt in a pleasure-palace, that he might count the lewd women as they sailed past, the many kinds of barges painted in all sorts of colours, the roses which were wafted about the lake, or that he might listen to the nocturnal brawls of serenaders? Would he not have preferred to remain in the shelter of a trench thrown up by his own hands to serve for a single night? Would not anyone who is a man have his slumbers broken by a war-trumpet rather than by a chorus of serenaders?

13 But I have been haranguing against Baiae long enough; although I never could harangue often enough against vice. Vice, Lucilius, is what I wish you to proceed against, without limit and without end. For it has neither limit nor end. If any vice rend your heart, cast it away from you; and if you cannot be rid of it in any other way, pluck out your heart also. Above all, drive pleasures from your sight. Hate them beyond all other things, for they are like the bandits whom the Egyptians call ""lovers,""**[6]** who embrace us only to garrotte us. Farewell.

**[1]** *Etna was of especial interest to Lucilius. Besides being a Govenor in Sicily, he may have written the poem Aetna. For Seneca's own curiosity regarding the mountain compare Ep. lxxix. 5 ff.*

**[2]** *Not far from Naples, and across the bay from Puteoli. It was a fashionable and dissolute watering place.*

**[3]** *Situated at the mouth of the westernmost branch of the Nile, and proverbial in Latin literature for the laxity of its morals.*

**[4]** *There is considerable doubt whether symphonia was vocal or instrumental music. The passage probably refers either to glee-singers (as in Venice to-day) or to bands of flute-players playing part-music. Cicero (Verr. iii. 44. 105) mentions them as providing entertainment at banquets.*

**[5]** *See Letter lxxxvi.*

**[6]** *The Egyptians used the word φηλητής in the sense of ""knave"" or ""foot-pad."" The word is found in the Hecate of Callimachus. Hesychius defines it as equal to κλώψ ""thief."" It was pronounced in the same way as φιλητής ""lover,"" and in late Greek was spelt in the same way.*

I have a reminder on my left and right wrists that constantly remind me of this one unanswerable inconsistency in my belief system. I spend a lot of time trying to eliminate inconsistencies from this belief system, so it is true that I hold many counter-intuitive beliefs, making informal antecedents and explanations necessary in describing to you my one unanswerable question.

The left wrist reminder is the Ancient Greek word 'logos' reading outward toward 'the world'. The word, to me, proclaims that there is a natural and consistent order to the universe (yeah, I kind of have a boner for the word consistence. Insert your fiber and stool jokes here), and that each single event in the world is an effect, with a cause to explain it. This includes the actions of others. So, when someone is being an asshole and, say, punches me in the face, there is an exact cause or formula of causes to that event. His father beat him and his perspective of his father was that of power rather than that of pettiness, so in his mental development of values he wished to emulate his imperfect father, and now believes that force determines the stronger; or, he was born with a disposition/gene that makes him prone anger, and has a weak or non-existent disposition/gene for self-control; or, he's just a decent and well-rounded guy that has just had the worst day of his life, has a moment of weakness, and finds release. Whatever it may be, the causes keep regressing infinitely, to the first event that ever happened, essentially making the entirety of human, and even cosmic existence, a domino effect, and each action, along with the actions of the environment, nothing but dominoes waiting to be tipped. It may be impossible to trace the exact pattern, becoming an extremely complex system of 'a' influencing 'b' and 'c', 'b' influencing 'a' and 'c', and 'c' influencing 'a' and 'b' simultaneously; but, nevertheless, this is precisely what is happening, and it's beautiful, and  I believe what many people mean when they say ""God."" Whatever it may be, back to the example, this man, independent of anything else, could not have possibly *not* hit me in the face. It's just that his life has led him to that. Since it shows a lacking in understanding on his part, at least from my point of view, I am not drawn to anger, but pity; a sort of somber elitism, even.

The right wrist reminder is the Ancient Greek word 'arete' reading inward toward 'the self'. The word, to me, proclaims that the quality of the self or the soul is the highest personal value, and that harmony and order in the soul is vital to a fulfilling life. This can be achieved by remaining detached, and ordering priorities and responding to external stimuli in such a way that I am never carried away infavorably by false impressions. This way, anything that I am in control of is kept in harmony, and the boundaries of harmony are understood to be the furthest limits of the control which I have achieved.

Much more straight-forward an explanation than the left wrist, right? Yes, except one thing: if I am to believe that everything is the direct effect of some prior cause, what *is* the self or the soul? Where am *I*? If everything that *I* do is a combination of my environment, biological predispositions, and the combination of the two (experiences that I've framed with bits and pieces of prior experiential information and predispositions to feel a certain way, to think a certain way, etc..), what is left of *me*? How can someone in one instance completely forgive another for his gross actions, basing these actions on 'not *him*, but a general ignorance which is not his fault, but a necessary result of his circumstances', and yet maintain a sense of responsibility for self or soul? Yes, I see the possibility that self and soul exists as something completely pre-determined; it's just a collection of beliefs that are picked up. That's fine. It's just that without the idea that you or your choice are the direct cause of everything or at least some of the things that you do, what are you but the actual experiencing of things outside of your control?

Personally, I think that belief in both of these ideas: that every effect has its underlying cause, and this truth is beautiful and revealing, always to be carried along in your mind; along with the feeling that the quality of the self and the soul is of the utmost importance and responsibility of the self and the soul; is either inconsistent, or, at the very best, only possible to stumble upon by chance.

Now I already have my theories, but I would like to hear it from the self-proclaimed Stoics, as I've never really spoken to a Stoic. So, Stoics of Reddit:

A) Is this system of beliefs aligned with what Stoicism is to each of you?

I attempt to answer my own question below, but I would appreciate any feedback.

Reading Hicks and Hick's translation of Meditations (The Emperor's Handbook), I came across this quote and many others like it:

""Gladly put yourself in Clotho's (a goddess of fate) hands and let her weave your thread into the great web of life however she chooses.""

This is commonly elucidated as predestination in Christian beliefs -- all acts have already been willed by God.

As an atheist, I can't subscribe to the idea that there is a conscious higher (or lower) being that controls the levers of fate and the universe. And then I think of this quote from Stephen Hawking:

**“I have noticed that even those who assert that everything is predestined and that we can change nothing about it still look both ways before they cross the street”**

However, my sense from Aurelius is that there is a stoic course of action for both believers and non-believers alike. He appears to offer two alternatives to what happens to you when you die: one if gods exist and one if they don't, neither of which matter to living stoically.

I'm going to try to reconcile what Hawking is saying against what Aurelius says: 

To me, nature (the course of ""things"" since the beginning of the universe) led to the point of someone crossing the road and looking both ways and consequently, not getting hit by a car. 

The person who looks both ways was told by a mother who in turn was told by her mother who in turn knew someone who was struck by a car and vowed to tell her offspring that they should look both ways before crossing the road. Or maybe the road-crosser saw someone do it on TV and thought it would be a good idea. Regardless, my point is that a series of events, actions and circumstances leads to someone looking both ways or not, and these actions are set in motion with the beginning of the universe. Hence, you don't need a god or Gods to believe in predestination. In the road crossing example, this explains the reason that any car would be within range to strike a person or even why a road worth crossing exists at all.

In sum, you can trace the cause or existence of anything in the present to the beginning of the universe. 

And according to the stoics, none of this is bad or good, it just is. And it is this acceptance of fate that makes things beyond our control worth being indifferent about.

If the above makes sense to you, then I could say that we have free will (and the choice to be stoic) inasmuch as the course of the universe has led to us making the choices we make in the present. You arrived at r/stoicism for reasons that could hypothetically be traced back to the beginning of the universe, just as someone would have reasons for rejecting stoic thought.

I know of no one with whom I should be willing to have you shared. And see what an opinion of you I have; for I dare to trust you with your own self. Crates, they say, the disciple of the very Stilbo whom I mentioned in a former letter, noticed a young man walking by himself, and asked him what he was doing all alone. ""*I am communing with myself*,"" replied the youth. ""*Pray be careful, then*,"" said Crates, ""*and take good heed; you are communing with a bad man!*""

2 When persons are in mourning, or fearful about something, we are accustomed to watch them that we may prevent them from making a wrong use of their loneliness. No thoughtless person ought to be left alone; in such cases he only plans folly, and heaps up future dangers for himself or for others; he brings into play his base desires; the mind displays what fear or shame used to repress; it whets his boldness, stirs his passions, and goads his anger. And finally, the only benefit that solitude confers, - the habit of trusting no man, and of fearing no witnesses, - is lost to the fool; for he betrays himself.

Mark therefore what my hopes are for you, - nay, rather, what I am promising myself, inasmuch as hope is merely the title of an uncertain blessing: I do not know any person with whom I should prefer you to associate rather than yourself. 3 I remember in what a great-souled way you hurled forth certain phrases, and how full of strength they were! I immediately congratulated myself and said: ""*These words did not come from the edge of the lips; these utterances have a solid foundation. This man is not one of the many; he has regard for his real welfare*."" 4 Speak, and live, in this way; see to it that nothing keeps you down. As for your former prayers, you may dispense the gods from answering them; offer new prayers; pray for a sound mind and for good health, first of soul and then of body. And of course you should offer those prayers frequently. Call boldly upon God; you will not be asking him for that which belongs to another.

5 But I must, as is my custom, send a little gift along with this letter. It is a true saying which I have found in Athenodorus:**[1]** ""*Know that thou art freed from all desires when thou hast reached such a point that thou prayest to God for nothing except what thou canst pray for openly*."" But how foolish men are now! They whisper the basest of prayers to heaven; but if anyone listens, they are silent at once. That which they are unwilling for men to know, they communicate to God. Do you not think, then, that some such wholesome advice as this could be given you: ""*Live among men as if God beheld you; speak with God as if men were listening*""? Farewell.

I do not merely exhort you to keep at it; I actually beg you to do so. I warn you, however, not to act after the fashion of those who desire to be conspicuous rather than to improve, by doing things which will rouse comment as regards your dress or general way of living. 2 Repellent attire, unkempt hair, slovenly beard, open scorn of silver dishes, a couch on the bare earth, and any other perverted forms of self-display, are to be avoided. The mere name of philosophy, however quietly pursued, is an object of sufficient scorn; and what would happen if we should begin to separate ourselves from the customs of our fellow-men? Inwardly, we ought to be different in all respects, but our exterior should conform to society. 3 Do not wear too fine, nor yet too frowzy, a toga. One needs no silver plate, encrusted and embossed in solid gold; but we should not believe the lack of silver and gold to be proof of the simple life. Let us try to maintain a higher standard of life than that of the multitude, but not a contrary standard; otherwise, we shall frighten away and repel the very persons whom we are trying to improve. We also bring it about that they are unwilling to imitate us in anything, because they are afraid lest they might be compelled to imitate us in everything.

4 The first thing which philosophy undertakes to give is fellow-feeling with all men; in other words, sympathy and sociability. We part company with our promise if we are unlike other men. We must see to it that the means by which we wish to draw admiration be not absurd and odious. Our motto,**[1]** as you know, is ""Live according to Nature""; but it is quite contrary to nature to torture the body, to hate unlaboured elegance, to be dirty on purpose, to eat food that is not only plain, but disgusting and forbidding. 5 Just as it is a sign of luxury to seek out dainties, so it is madness to avoid that which is customary and can be purchased at no great price. Philosophy calls for plain living, but not for penance; and we may perfectly well be plain and neat at the same time. This is the mean of which I approve; our life should observe a happy medium between the ways of a sage and the ways of the world at large; all men should admire it, but they should understand it also.

6 ""Well then, shall we act like other men? Shall there be no distinction between ourselves and the world?"" Yes, a very great one; let men find that we are unlike the common herd, if they look closely. If they visit us at home, they should admire us, rather than our household appointments. He is a great man who uses earthenware dishes as if they were silver; but he is equally great who uses silver as if it were earthenware. It is the sign of an unstable mind not to be able to endure riches.

7 But I wish to share with you to-day's profit also. I find in the writings of our**[2]** Hecato that the limiting of desires helps also to cure fears: ""Cease to hope,"" he says, ""and you will cease to fear."" ""But how,"" you will reply, ""can things so different go side by side?"" In this way, my dear Lucilius: though they do seem at variance, yet they are really united. Just as the same chain fastens the prisoner and the soldier who guards him, so hope and fear, dissimilar as they are, keep step together; fear follows hope. 8 I am not surprised that they proceed in this way; each alike belongs to a mind that is in suspense, a mind that is fretted by looking forward to the future. But the chief cause of both these ills is that we do not adapt ourselves to the present, but send our thoughts a long way ahead. And so foresight, the noblest blessing of the human race, becomes perverted. 9 Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring bane to us; for memory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them. The present alone can make no man wretched. Farewell.

___

On the subject of food he used to speak frequently and very emphatically too, as a question of no small significance, nor leading to unimportant consequences; indeed he believed that the beginning and foundation of temperance lay in self-control in eating and drinking. 


Once, putting aside other themes such as he habitually discussed, he spoke somewhat as follows. As one should prefer inexpensive food to expensive and what is abundant to what is scarce, so one should prefer what is natural for men to what is not. Now food from plants of the earth is natural to us, grains and those which though not cereals can nourish man well, and also food (other than flesh) from animals which are domesticated. 


Of these foods the most useful are those which can be used at once without fire, since they are also most easily available; for example fruits in season, some of the green vegetables, milk, cheese, and honey. Also those which require fire for their preparation, whether grains or vegetables, are not unsuitable, and are all natural food for man. 


On the other hand he showed that meat was a less civilized kind of food and more appropriate for wild animals. He held that it was a heavy food and an obstacle to thinking and reasoning, since the exhalations rising from it being turbid darkened the soul. For this reason also the people who make larger use of it seem slower in intellect. 


Furthermore, as man of all creatures on earth is the nearest of kin to the gods, so he should be nourished in a manner most like the gods. Now the vapors rising from the earth and water are sufficient for them, and so, he said, we ought to be nourished on food most like that, the lightest and purest; for thus our souls would be pure and dry, and being so, would be finest and wisest, as it seemed to Heraclitus when he said, ""*The clear dry soul is wisest and best*"". 


But now, he said, we feed ourselves much worse than the unreasoning brutes. For even if they, driven by appetite as by a lash, fall upon their food, nevertheless they are not guilty of making a fuss about their food and exercising ingenuity about it, but they are satisfied with what comes their way, seeking satiety only, nothing more. But we contrive all kinds of arts and devices to give relish to eating and to make more enticing the act of swallowing. We have come to such a point of delicacy in eating and gourmanderie that as some people have written books on music and medicine, so some have even written books on cooking which aim to increase the pleasure of the palate, but ruin the health.


It is at all events a common observation that those who are luxurious and intemperate in food have much less vigorous health. Some, in fact, are like women who have the unnatural cravings of pregnancy; these men, like such women, refuse the most common foods and have their digestion utterly ruined.**[1]** Thus, as worn-out iron constantly needs tempering, their appetites continually demand being sharpened either by neat wine or a sharp sauce or some sour relish.


But no such man was the Laconian who, on seeing a man refuse to eat a young peacock or other expensive bird that was placed before him, and complain that he could not eat because of lack of appetite, remarked, ""*But I could eat a vulture or a buzzard*"". Zeno of Citium even when he was ill thought that no unusually delicate food should be brought him, and when the attending physician ordered him to eat squab, he would not allow it, and said, ""*Treat me as you would treat my slave Manes*"".**[2]** For I imagine that he thought there should be nothing more delicate in his treatment than for one of his slaves if he were ill; for if they can be cured without receiving more delicate fare, so can we. Surely a good man should be no more delicate than a slave; and for that reason Zeno very likely thought he ought to beware of delicacy in diet and not yield to it in the least, for if he once yielded he would go the whole way, since in the matter of food and drink, pleasure accelerates its pace alarmingly. The words spoken on that occasion concerning food and nourishment seemed to us more unusual than the customary discourses day by day.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

In order to support more easily and more cheerfully those hardships which we may expect to suffer in behalf of virtue and goodness, it is useful to recall what hardships people will endure for unworthy ends. Thus for example consider what intemperate lovers undergo for the sake of evil desires,**[1]** and how much exertion others expend for the sake of making profit,**[2]** and how much suffering those who are pursuing fame endure, and bear in mind that all of these people submit to all kinds of toil and hardship voluntarily. Is it not then monstrous that they for no honorable reward endure such things,**[3]** while we for the sake of the ideal good—that is not only the avoidance of evil such as wrecks our lives, but also the acquisition of virtue, which we may call the provider of all goods—are not ready to bear every hardship? 

And yet would not anyone admit how much better it is, in place of exerting oneself to win someone else's wife, to exert oneself to discipline one's desires; in place of enduring hardships for the sake of money, to train oneself to want little; instead of giving oneself trouble about getting notoriety, to give oneself trouble how not to thirst for notoriety; instead of trying to find a way to injure an envied person, to inquire how not to envy anyone; and instead of slaving, as sycophants do, to win false friends, to undergo suffering in order to possess true friends? 

Now, since, in general, toil and hardship are a necessity for all men, both for those who seek the better ends and for those who seek the worse, it is preposterous that those who are pursuing the better are not much more eager in their efforts than those for whom there is small hope of reward for all their pains. Yet when we see acrobats**[4]** face without concern their difficult tasks and risk their very lives in performing them, turning somersaults over up-turned swords or walking ropes set at a great height or flying through the air like birds,**[5]** where one misstep means death, all of which they do for a miserably small recompense, shall we not be ready to endure hardship for the sake of complete happiness? For surely there is no other end in becoming good than to become happy and to live happily for the remainder of our lives. 

One might reasonably reflect upon characteristics even of certain animals which are very well calculated to shame us into endurance of hardships.**[6]** At all events, cocks and quails, although they have no understanding of virtue as man has and know neither the good nor the just and strive for none of these things, nevertheless fight against each other and even when maimed stand up and endure until death so as not to submit the one to the other. 

How much more fitting, then, it is that we stand firm and endure, when we know that we are suffering for some good purpose, either to help our friends or to benefit our city, or to defend our wives and children, or, best and most imperative, to become good and just and self-controlled, a state which no man achieves without hardships. And so it remains for me to say that the man who is unwilling to exert himself almost always convicts himself as unworthy of good, since ""we gain every good by toil.""**[7]** These words and others like them he then spoke, exhorting and urging his listeners to look upon hardship with disdain.

Virtue, he said, is not simply theoretical knowledge, but it is practical application as well, just like the arts of medicine and music.**[1]** Therefore, as the physician and the musician not only must master the theoretical side of their respective arts but must also train themselves to act according to their principles, so a man who wishes to become good not only must be thoroughly familiar with the precepts which are conducive to virtue but must also be earnest and zealous in applying these principles.

How, indeed, could a person immediately become temperate if he only knew that one must not be overcome by pleasures, but was quite unpracticed in withstanding pleasures? How could one become just when he had learned that one must love fairness but had never exercised himself in avoidance of selfishness and greed? How could we acquire courage if we had merely learned that the things which seem dreadful to the average person are not to be feared, but had no experience in showing courage in the face of such things? How could we become prudent if we had come to recognize what things are truly good and what evil, but had never had practice in despising things which only seem good?

Therefore upon the learning of the lessons appropriate to each and every excellence, practical training must follow invariably, if indeed from the lessons we have learned we hope to derive any benefit. And moreover such practical exercise is the more important for the student of philosophy than for the student of medicine or any similar art, the more philosophy claims to be a greater and more difficult discipline than any other study. The reason for this is that men who enter the other professions have not had their souls corrupted beforehand and have not learned the opposite of what they are going to be taught, but the ones who start out to study philosophy have been born and reared in an environment filled with corruption and evil, and therefore turn to virtue in such a state that they need a longer and more thorough training. 

How, then, and in what manner should they receive such training? Since it so happens that the human being is not soul alone, nor body alone, but a kind of synthesis of the two, the person in training must take care of both, the better part, the soul, more zealously; as is fitting, but also of the other, if he shall not be found lacking in any part that constitutes man.**[2]** For obviously the philosopher's body should be well prepared for physical activity, because often the virtues make use of this as a necessary instrument for the affairs of life. 

Now there are two kinds of training, one which is appropriate for the soul alone, and the other which is common to both soul and body. We use the training common to both when we discipline ourselves to cold, heat, thirst, hunger, meager rations, hard beds, avoidance of pleasures, and patience under suffering. For by these things and others like them the body is strengthened and becomes capable of enduring hardship, sturdy and ready for any task; the soul too is strengthened since it is trained for courage by patience under hardship and for self-control by abstinence from pleasures. 

Training which is peculiar to the soul consists first of all in seeing that the proofs pertaining to apparent goods as not being real goods are always ready at hand and likewise those pertaining to apparent evils as not being real evils, and in learning to recognize the things which are truly good and in becoming accustomed to distinguish them from what are not truly good. In the next place it consists of practice in not avoiding any of the things which only seem evil, and in not pursuing any of the things which only seem good; in shunning by every means those which are truly evil and in pursuing by every means those which are truly good.

In summary, then, I have tried to tell what the nature of each type of training is. I shall not, however, endeavor to discuss how the training should be carried out in detail, by analyzing and distinguishing what is appropriate for the soul and the body in common and what is appropriate for the soul alone, but by presenting without fixed order what is proper for each. It is true that all of us who have participated in philosophic discussion have heard and apprehended that neither pain nor death nor poverty nor anything else which is free from wrong is an evil, and again that wealth, life, pleasure, or anything else which does not partake of virtue is not a good. And yet, in spite of understanding this, because of the depravity which has become implanted in us straight from childhood and because of evil habits engendered by this depravity, when hardship comes we think an evil has come upon us, and when pleasure comes our way we think that a good has befallen us; we dread death as the most extreme misfortune; we cling to life as the greatest blessing, and when we give away money we grieve as if we were injured, but upon receiving it we rejoice as if a benefit had been conferred.

Similarly with the majority of other things, we do not meet circumstances in accordance with right principles, but rather we follow wretched habit. Since, then, I repeat, all this is the case, the person who is in training must strive to habituate himself not to love pleasure, not to avoid hardship, not to be infatuated with living, not to fear death, and in the case of goods or money not to place receiving above giving.

**[1]** *Musonius here identifies himself with the philosophers who, following the example of Plato, believe that virtue can be taught*.

**[2]** *Unlike his pupil Epictetus, who showed contempt for the body, Musonius emphasizes the interdependence of soul and body. This view, wholly consistent with the true Stoic pantheism, is not alien to Neoplatonic thought*.

1376598806.0,9,self.Stoicism,1kfxig,"On wisdom and retirement - Seneca, Letter 68",ThatsOK,11,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1kfxig/on_wisdom_and_retirement_seneca_letter_68/,"1 I fall in with your plan; retire and conceal yourself in repose. But at the same time conceal your retirement also. In doing this, you may be sure that you will be following the example of the Stoics, if not their precept. But you will be acting according to their precept also; you will thus satisfy both yourself and any Stoic you please. 

2 We Stoics**[1]** do not urge men to take up public life in every case, or at all times, or without any qualification. Besides, when we have assigned to our wise man that field of public life which is worthy of him, – in other words, the universe, – he is then not apart from public life, even if he withdraws; nay, perhaps he has abandoned only one little corner thereof and has passed over into greater and wider regions; and when he has been set in the heavens, he understands how lowly was the place in which he sat when he mounted the curule chair or the judgment-seat. Lay this to heart, that the wise man is never more active in affairs than when things divine as well as things human have come within his ken.

3 I now return to the advice which I set out to give you, – that you keep your retirement in the background. There is no need to fasten a placard upon yourself with the words: ""Philosopher and Quietist."" Give your purpose some other name; call it ill-health and bodily weakness, or mere laziness. To boast of our retirement is but idle self-seeking. 

4 Certain animals hide themselves from discovery by confusing the marks of their foot-prints in the neighbourhood of their lairs. You should do the same. Otherwise, there will always be someone dogging your footsteps. Many men pass by that which is visible, and peer after things hidden and concealed; a locked room invites the thief. Things which lie in the open appear cheap; the house-breaker passes by that which is exposed to view. This is the way of the world, and the way of all ignorant men: they crave to burst in upon hidden things. It is therefore best not to vaunt one's retirement. 

5 It is, however, a sort of vaunting to make too much of one's concealment and of one's withdrawal from the sight of men. So-and-so**[2]** has gone into his retreat at Tarentum; that other man has shut himself up at Naples; this third person for many years has not crossed the threshold of his own house. To advertise one's retirement is to collect a crowd. 

6 When you withdraw from the world your business is to talk with yourself, not to have men talk about you. But what shall you talk about? Do just what people are fond of doing when they talk about their neighbours, – speak ill of yourself when by yourself; then you will become accustomed both to speak and to hear the truth. Above all, however, ponder that which you come to feel is your greatest weakness.

7 Each man knows best the defects of his own body. And so one relieves his stomach by vomiting, another props it up by frequent eating, another drains and purges his body by periodic fasting. Those whose feet are visited by pain abstain either from wine or from the bath. In general, men who are careless in other respects go out of their way to relieve the disease which frequently afflicts them. So it is with our souls; there are in them certain parts which are, so to speak, on the sick-list,**[3]** and to these parts the cure must be applied.

8 What, then, am I myself doing with my leisure? I am trying to cure my own sores. If I were to show you a swollen foot, or an inflamed hand, or some shrivelled sinews in a withered leg, you would permit me to lie quiet in one place and to apply lotions to the diseased member.**[4]** But my trouble is greater than any of these, and I cannot show it to you. The abscess, or ulcer, is deep within my breast. Pray, pray, do not commend me, do not say: ""What a great man! He has learned to despise all things; condemning the madnesses of man's life, he has made his escape!"" I have condemned nothing except myself. 

9 There is no reason why you should desire to come to me for the sake of making progress. You are mistaken if you think that you will get any assistance from this quarter; it is not a physician that dwells here, but a sick man. I would rather have you say, on leaving my presence: ""I used to think him a happy man and a learned one, and I had pricked up my ears to hear him; but I have been defrauded. I have seen nothing, heard nothing which I craved and which I came back to hear."" If you feel thus, and speak thus, some progress has been made. I prefer you to pardon rather than envy my retirement.

10 Then you say: ""Is it retirement, Seneca, that you are recommending to me? You will soon be falling back upon the maxims of Epicurus!""**[5]** I do recommend retirement to you, but only that you may use it for greater and more beautiful activities than those which you have resigned; to knock at the haughty doors of the influential, to make alphabetical lists of childless old men,**[6]** to wield the highest authority in public life, – this kind of power exposes you to hatred, is short-lived, and, if you rate it at its true value, is tawdry. 

11 One man shall be far ahead of me as regards his influence in public life, another in salary as an army officer and in the position which results from this, another in the throng of his clients; but it is worth while to be outdone by all these men, provided that I myself can outdo Fortune. And I am no match for her in the throng; she has the greater backing.**[7]**

12 Would that in earlier days you had been minded to follow this purpose! Would that we were not discussing the happy life in plain view of death! But even now let us have no delay. For now we can take the word of experience, which tells us that there are many superfluous and hostile things; for this we should long since have taken the word of reason. 

13 Let us do what men are wont to do when they are late in setting forth, and wish to make up for lost time by increasing their speed – let us ply the spur. Our time of life is the best possible for these pursuits; for the period of boiling and foaming is now past.**[8]** The faults that were uncontrolled in the first fierce heat of youth are now weakened, and but little further effort is needed to extinguish them.

14 ""And when,"" you ask, ""will that profit you which you do not learn until your departure, and how will it profit you?"" Precisely in this way, that I shall depart a better man. You need not think, however, that any time of life is more fitted to the attainment of a sound mind than that which has gained the victory over itself by many trials and by long and oft-repeated regret for past mistakes, and, its passions assuaged, has reached a state of health. This is indeed the time to have acquired this good; he who has attained wisdom in his old age, has attained it by his years. Farewell.

Hi, all. I'm looking for beta readers for a short book I'm planning to self-publish on Stoicism and mindfulness. The book is a collection of meditations, exercises, and reflections on mindfulness and tranquility. It is meant to be relentlessly practical, but inspired heavily by the Stoic tradition and by the contemporary mindfulness literature.

Beta readers will receive an advance copy of the book with a set of questionnaires embedded that ask for your thoughts on the book. I'm looking for critical feedback to help me revise the book to make it as good as I can before I release it into the wild. If you are interested in mindfulness, meditation, or Stoicism, I think you would be an excellent candidate. Likewise, I think readers of Zen Habits, Life Hacker, or similar websites also fall into the target audience. But the book is written to be accessible to the general public, so really anyone is invited.

Please PM me with your email address to receive a copy if you are interested. I plan to have a first draft by the end of this week (6/28).

next is don't sweat what is out of your control. the only thing that is truly with in you control are your own actions. worrying over things you have no control over only gets you worked up over nothing.

don't sweat loss, things and people come into our lives and leave. every thing is transient it is how things are. 

emotion is an illusion that can not be trusted. only reason can be trusted. 

there is only virtue and lack of virtue. always strive for virtue.

try not to be judgmental. when some one dose something you don't like they may simply be a jerk or they might have a valid reason for what they are doing that you don't know about or don't understand.

I ought to go into retirement, and consider what sort of advice I should give you. For you yourself, who consult me, also reflected for a long time whether to do so; how much more, then, should I myself reflect, since more deliberation is necessary in settling than in propounding a problem! And this is particularly true when one thing is advantageous to you and another to me. Am I speaking again in the guise of an Epicurean?**[1]** 2. But the fact is, the same thing is advantageous to me which is advantageous to you; for I am not your friend unless whatever is at issue concerning you is my concern also. Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for yourself. 3 This fellowship, maintained with scrupulous care, which makes us mingle as men with our fellow-men and holds that the human race have certain rights in common, is also of great help in cherishing the more intimate fellowship which is based on friendship, concerning which I began to speak above. For he that has much in common with a fellow-man will have all things in common with a friend.

4 And on this point, my excellent Lucilius, I should like to have those subtle dialecticians of yours advise me how I ought to help a friend, or how a fellow man, rather than tell me in how many ways the word ""friend"" is used, and how many meanings the word ""man"" possesses. Lo, Wisdom and Folly are taking opposite sides. Which shall I join? Which party would you have me follow? On that side, ""man"" is the equivalent of ""friend""; on the other side, ""friend"" is not the equivalent of ""man."" The one wants a friend for his own advantage; the other wants to make himself an advantage to his friend.**[2]** What you have to offer me is nothing but distortion of words and splitting of syllables. 5. It is clear that unless I can devise some very tricky premisses and by false deductions tack on to them a fallacy which springs from the truth, I shall not be able to distinguish between what is desirable and what is to be avoided! I am ashamed! Old men as we are, dealing with a problem so serious, we make play of it!

6 ""'Mouse' is a syllable.**[3]** Now a mouse eats its cheese; therefore, a syllable eats cheese."" Suppose now that I cannot solve this problem; see what peril hangs over my head as a result of such ignorance! What a scrape I shall be in! Without doubt I must beware, or some day I shall be catching syllables in a mousetrap, or, if I grow careless, a book may devour my cheese! Unless, perhaps, the following syllogism is shrewder still: ""'Mouse' is a syllable. Now a syllable does not eat cheese. Therefore a mouse does not eat cheese."" 7. What childish nonsense! Do we knit our brows over this sort of problem? Do we let our beards grow long for this reason? Is this the matter which we teach with sour and pale faces?

Would you really know what philosophy offers to humanity? Philosophy offers counsel. Death calls away one man, and poverty chafes another; a third is worried either by his neighbour's wealth or by his own. So-and-so is afraid of bad luck; another desires to get away from his own good fortune. Some are ill-treated by men, others by the gods. 8. Why, then, do you frame for me such games as these? It is no occasion for jest; you are retained as counsel for unhappy mankind. You have promised to help those in peril by sea, those in captivity, the sick and the needy, and those whose heads are under the poised axe. Whither are you straying? What are you doing?

This friend, in whose company you are jesting, is in fear. Help him, and take the noose from about his neck. Men are stretching out imploring hands to you on all sides; lives ruined and in danger of ruin are begging for some assistance; men's hopes, men's resources, depend upon you. They ask that you deliver them from all their restlessness, that you reveal to them, scattered and wandering as they are, the clear light of truth. 9. Tell them what nature has made necessary, and what superfluous; tell them how simple are the laws that she has laid down, how pleasant and unimpeded life is for those who follow these laws, but how bitter and perplexed it is for those who have put their trust in opinion rather than in nature.

I should deem your games of logic to be of some avail in relieving men's burdens, if you could first show me what part of these burdens they will relieve. What among these games of yours banishes lust? Or controls it? Would that I could say that they were merely of no profit! They are positively harmful. I can make it perfectly clear to you whenever you wish, that a noble spirit when involved in such subtleties is impaired and weakened. 10. I am ashamed to say what weapons they supply to men who are destined to go to war with fortune, and how poorly they equip them! Is this the path to the greatest good? Is philosophy to proceed by such claptrap**[4]** and by quibbles which would be a disgrace and a reproach even for expounders**[5]** of the law? For what else is it that you men are doing, when you deliberately ensnare the person to whom you are putting questions, than making it appear that the man has lost his case on a technical error?**[6]** But just as the judge can reinstate those who have lost a suit in this way, so philosophy has reinstated these victims of quibbling to their former condition. 11. Why do you men abandon your mighty promises, and, after having assured me in high-sounding language that you will permit the glitter of gold to dazzle my eyesight no more than the gleam of the sword, and that I shall, with mighty steadfastness, spurn both that which all men crave and that which all men fear, why do you descend to the ABC's of scholastic pedants? What is your answer?

*Is this the path to heaven*? **[7]**

For that is exactly what philosophy promises to me, that I shall be made equal to God. For this I have been summoned, for this purpose have I come. Philosophy, keep your promise!

12 Therefore, my dear Lucilius, withdraw yourself as far as possible from these exceptions and objections of so-called philosophers. Frankness, and simplicity beseem true goodness. Even if there were many years left to you, you would have had to spend them frugally in order to have enough for the necessary things; but as it is, when your time is so scant, what madness it is to learn superfluous things! Farewell.

**[1]** *The Epicureans, who reduced all goods to ""utilities,"" could not regard a friend's advantage as identical to one's own advantage. And yet they laid great stress upon friendship as one of the chief sources of pleasure. For an attempt to reconcile these two positions see Cicero, De Finibus, i. 65 ff. Seneca has inadvertantly used a phrase that implies a difference between a friend's interest and one's own. This leads him to reassert the Stoic view of friendship, which adopted as its motto κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων.*

**[2]** *The sides are given in the reverse order in the two clauses: to the Stoic the terms ""friend"" and ""man"" are co-extensive; he is the friend of everybody, and his motive in friendship is to be of service; the Epicurean, however, narrows the definition of ""friend"" and regards him merely as an instrument to his own happiness.*

**[3]** * In this paragraph Seneca exposes the folly of trying to prove a truth by means of logical tricks, and offers a caricature of those which were current among the philosophers whom he derides.*

**[4]** *Literally, ""or if or if not,"" words constantly employed by the logicians in legal instruments. For the latter cf. Cicero, Pro Caecina, 23. 65 tum illud, quod dicitur, ""sive nive"" irrident, tum aucupia verborum et litterarum tendiculas in invidiam vocant.*

**[5]** *Literally, ""to those who sit studying the praetor's edicts."" The album is the bulletin-board, on which the edicts of the praetor were posted, giving the formulae and stipulations for legal processes of various kinds.*

**[6]** *In certain actions the praetor appointed a judge and established a formula, indicating the plaintiff's claim and the judge's duty. If the statement was false, or the claim excessive, the plaintiff lost his case; under certain conditions (see last sentence of Seneca § 11) the defendant could claim annulment of the formula and have the case tried again. Such cases were not lost on their merits, and for that reason the lawyer who purposely took such an advantage was doing a contemptible thing.*

**[7]** *Vergil, Aeneid, ix. 641.*

1367871909.0,9,self.Stoicism,1dtb9a,"On master and slave - Seneca, Letter 47",ThatsOK,10,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1dtb9a/on_master_and_slave_seneca_letter_47/,"1 I am glad to learn, through those who come from you, that you live on friendly terms with your slaves. This befits a sensible and well-educated man like yourself. ""They are slaves,"" people declare.**[1]** Nay, rather they are men. ""Slaves!"" No, comrades. ""Slaves!"" No, they are unpretentious friends. ""Slaves!"" No, they are our fellow-slaves, if one reflects that Fortune has equal rights over slaves and free men alike.

2 That is why I smile at those who think it degrading for a man to dine with his slave. But why should they think it degrading? It is only because purse-proud etiquette surrounds a householder at his dinner with a mob of standing slaves. The master eats more than he can hold, and with monstrous greed loads his belly until it is stretched and at length ceases to do the work of a belly; so that he is at greater pains to discharge all the food than he was to stuff it down. 3. All this time the poor slaves may not move their lips, even to speak. The slightest murmur is repressed by the rod; even a chance sound, – a cough, a sneeze, or a hiccup, – is visited with the lash. There is a grievous penalty for the slightest breach of silence. All night long they must stand about, hungry and dumb.

4 The result of it all is that these slaves, who may not talk in their master's presence, talk about their master. But the slaves of former days, who were permitted to converse not only in their master's presence, but actually with him, whose mouths were not stitched up tight, were ready to bare their necks for their master, to bring upon their own heads any danger that threatened him; they spoke at the feast, but kept silence during torture. 5. Finally, the saying, in allusion to this same high-handed treatment, becomes current: ""As many enemies as you have slaves."" They are not enemies when we acquire them; we make them enemies.

I shall pass over other cruel and inhuman conduct towards them; for we maltreat them, not as if they were men, but as if they were beasts of burden. When we recline at a banquet, one slave mops up the disgorged food, another crouches beneath the table and gathers up the left-overs of the tipsy guests. 6. Another carves the priceless game birds; with unerring strokes and skilled hand he cuts choice morsels along the breast or the rump. Hapless fellow, to live only for the purpose of cutting fat capons correctly – unless, indeed, the other man is still more unhappy than he, who teaches this art for pleasure's sake, rather than he who learns it because he must. 7. Another, who serves the wine, must dress like a woman and wrestle with his advancing years; he cannot get away from his boyhood; he is dragged back to it; and though he has already acquired a soldier's figure, he is kept beardless by having his hair smoothed away or plucked out by the roots, and he must remain awake throughout the night, dividing his time between his master's drunkenness and his lust; in the chamber he must be a man, at the feast a boy.**[2]** 8. Another, whose duty it is to put a valuation on the guests, must stick to his task, poor fellow, and watch to see whose flattery and whose immodesty, whether of appetite or of language, is to get them an invitation for to-morrow. Think also of the poor purveyors of food, who note their masters' tastes with delicate skill, who know what special flavours will sharpen their appetite, what will please their eyes, what new combinations will rouse their cloyed stomachs, what food will excite their loathing through sheer satiety, and what will stir them to hunger on that particular day. With slaves like these the master cannot bear to dine; he would think it beneath his dignity to associate with his slave at the same table! Heaven forfend!

But how many masters is he creating in these very men! 9. I have seen standing in the line, before the door of Callistus, the former master,**[3]** of Callistus; I have seen the master himself shut out while others were welcomed, – the master who once fastened the ""For Sale"" ticket on Callistus and put him in the market along with the good-for-nothing slaves. But he has been paid off by that slave who was shuffled into the first lot of those on whom the crier practises his lungs; the slave, too, in his turn has cut his name from the list and in his turn has adjudged him unfit to enter his house. The master sold Callistus, but how much has Callistus made his master pay for!

10 Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies. It is just as possible for you to see in him a free-born man as for him to see in you a slave. As a result of the massacres in Marius's**[4]** day, many a man of distinguished birth, who was taking the first steps toward senatorial rank by service in the army, was humbled by fortune, one becoming a shepherd, another a caretaker of a country cottage. Despise, then, if you dare, those to whose estate you may at any time descend, even when you are despising them.

11 I do not wish to involve myself in too large a question, and to discuss the treatment of slaves, towards whom we Romans are excessively haughty, cruel, and insulting. But this is the kernel of my advice: Treat your inferiors as you would be treated by your betters. And as often as you reflect how much power you have over a slave, remember that your master has just as much power over you. 12. ""But I have no master,"" you say. You are still young; perhaps you will have one. Do you not know at what age Hecuba entered captivity, or Croesus, or the mother of Darius, or Plato, or Diogenes?**[5]**

13 Associate with your slave on kindly, even on affable, terms; let him talk with you, plan with you, live with you. I know that at this point all the exquisites will cry out against me in a body; they will say: ""There is nothing more debasing, more disgraceful, than this."" But these are the very persons whom I sometimes surprise kissing the hands of other men's slaves. 14. Do you not see even this, how our ancestors removed from masters everything invidious, and from slaves everything insulting? They called the master ""father of the household,"" and the slaves ""members of the household,"" a custom which still holds in the mime. They established a holiday on which masters and slaves should eat together, – not as the only day for this custom, but as obligatory on that day in any case. They allowed the slaves to attain honours in the household and to pronounce judgment;**[6]** they held that a household was a miniature commonwealth.

15 ""Do you mean to say,"" comes the retort, ""that I must seat all my slaves at my own table?"" No, not any more than that you should invite all free men to it. You are mistaken if you think that I would bar from my table certain slaves whose duties are more humble, as, for example, yonder muleteer or yonder herdsman; I propose to value them according to their character, and not according to their duties. Each man acquires his character for himself, but accident assigns his duties. Invite some to your table because they deserve the honor, and others that they may come to deserve it. For if there is any slavish quality in them as the result of their low associations, it will be shaken off by intercourse with men of gentler breeding. 16. You need not, my dear Lucilius, hunt for friends only in the forum or in the Senate-house; if you are careful and attentive, you will find them at home also. Good material often stands idle for want of an artist; make the experiment, and you will find it so. As he is a fool who, when purchasing a horse, does not consider the animal's points, but merely his saddle and bridle; so he is doubly a fool who values a man from his clothes or from his rank, which indeed is only a robe that clothes us.

17 ""He is a slave."" His soul, however, may be that of a freeman. ""He is a slave."" But shall that stand in his way? Show me a man who is not a slave; one is a slave to lust, another to greed, another to ambition, and all men are slaves to fear. I will name you an ex-consul who is slave to an old hag, a millionaire who is slave to a serving-maid; I will show you youths of the noblest birth in serfdom to pantomime players! No servitude is more disgraceful than that which is self-imposed.

You should therefore not be deterred by these finicky persons from showing yourself to your slaves as an affable person and not proudly superior to them; they ought to respect you rather than fear you. 18. Some may maintain that I am now offering the liberty-cap to slaves in general and toppling down lords from their high estate, because I bid slaves respect their masters instead of fearing them. They say: ""This is what he plainly means: slaves are to pay respect as if they were clients or early-morning callers!"" Anyone who holds this opinion forgets that what is enough for a god cannot be too little for a master. Respect means love, and love and fear cannot be mingled. 19. So I hold that you are entirely right in not wishing to be feared by your slaves, and in lashing them merely with the tongue; only dumb animals need the thong.

That which annoys us does not necessarily injure us; but we are driven into wild rage by our luxurious lives, so that whatever does not answer our whims arouses our anger. 20. We don the temper of kings. For they, too, forgetful alike of their own strength and of other men's weakness, grow white-hot with rage, as if they had received an injury, when they are entirely protected from danger of such injury by their exalted station. They are not unaware that this is true, but by finding fault they seize upon opportunities to do harm; they insist that they have received injuries, in order that they may inflict them.

21 I do not wish to delay you longer; for you need no exhortation. This, among other things, is a mark of good character: it forms its own judgments and abides by them; but badness is fickle and frequently changing, not for the better, but for something different. Farewell.

**Title**: [*The Stoics: A Guide for the Perplexed*](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16799791W/The_Stoics)

**Author**: M. Andrew Holowchak 

**Publisher**: Continuum International Publishing Group 

**Year**: 2008 

**Pages**: 237 

# **Content**

*The Stoics* is a short introduction to Stoicism, with the aim showing that Stoicism can be a suitable way of life. The primary focus of the books is on the ethical aspects of Stoicism; it covers the history of Stoicism and Stoic physics and cosmology in only a few pages each. The book does not shy away from aspects of the ethics that modern (and even ancient) people will find implausible or extreme, and with which Holowchak himself disagrees. Instead, it describes and critically examines them directly.

The book contains six major sections:

 * an *introduction*, which includes not only the usual description of the structure, intent, and motivation of the book, but also includes the history of Stoicism and a short summary of what Holowchak views as the fundamental theses of canonical Stoicism.
 * *The Stoic Sage* and *The Stoic Progressor* cover these theses in greater detail, provide short summary of Stoic cosmology and epistemology, and a longer, more systematic description of the Stoic ethical system. These sections include discussions of Nature, *oikeiosis*, emotions, the nature and importance of the Sage, and other concepts central to Stoicism. His stated (in the introduction) purpose for these chapters is to describe canonical Stoicism in the first of these sections and to show its relevance today in the second, but this division is not completely apparent in the content; while the less accepted and plausible aspects of classical Stoicism are indeed grouped in the *The Stoic Sage*, the *The Stoic Progressor* also introduced and covers topics which appear to me to be central elements of canonical Stoicism.
 * The next sections, *Equanimity in Adversity* and *Equanimity in Prosperity*, concern Stoic attitudes and the practical application of Stoicism to concrete situations. Chapters in these sections cover pain, grief and anger, gifts, ""the soft life,"" friendship, restlessness, scholarly self-indulgence, and other practical topics.
 * The final section, *The Heroic Course*, discusses Stoic training and teaching, ""curatives"" (exercises), and the nature of Stoic progress.

# **Style**

The individual chapters within each section are focused, concise accounts of cohesive topics. Despite his goal of practical application, Holowchak does not avoid Stoic Greek technical jargon; in some cases he mentions the Greek work but uses the English translation thereafter (as in the case of *arete* and virtue), while in others he uses the Greek term throughout (as in the case of *khreiai*). In cases where he finds the classical view implausible or too extreme, he presents the classical view and discusses its weaknesses and insights, rather than simply presenting an account he finds plausible.

The book includes many quotes and extended extracts from classical sources. These are generally well chosen, and integrate well with the main text. Assertions in the text are accompanied by copious citations. The balance between quoted content and cited content is well judged: the book can be read smoothly without reference to outside content, but it is easy to look up original sources when the reader so desires.

# **Uses and audience**

*The Stoics* could be an excellent introduction to Stoicism for readers looking for a philosophy for practical application, provided they read the whole book. The structure of the book, in which the more extreme, abstract, and implausible aspects of Stoicism are presented first, may discourage such readers from reading through to the sections they will find most interesting. On the other hand, the structure means that the descriptions of practical situations come after the reader has had the background helpful for understanding them.

The extensive references and quotes, in the context of short chapters on specific topics in which modern readers may be interested, can help readers already familiar with Stoicism find specific pieces of ancient literature relevant to specific topics of interest, and in this way the book serves as a curated index.

Readers (whether new to Stoicism or not) interested in Stoic exercises will find *The Stoics* useful in several ways. Each chapter is followed by one or more *khreiai*, sayings suitable for memorization or regular rereading to reinforce Stoic teachings. The section of Stoic ""curatives"" near the end has a list of exercises that overlaps those found in other sources, such as Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*. The list includes a few I have not seen elsewhere, and Holowchak's description sometimes has a different perspective, and again he includes good references to the classical literature. The major fault to his accounts of the exercises is his brevity.

This idea, however, clear though it is, must be strengthened and implanted more deeply by daily reflection; it is more important for you to keep the resolutions you have already made than to go on and make noble ones. You must persevere, must develop new strength by continuous study, until that which is only a good inclination becomes a good settled purpose. 2. Hence you no longer need to come to me with much talk and protestations; I know that you have made great progress. I understand the feelings which prompt your words; they are not feigned or specious words. Nevertheless I shall tell you what I think, - that at present I have hopes for you, but not yet perfect trust. And I wish that you would adopt the same attitude towards yourself; there is no reason why you should put confidence in yourself too quickly and readily. Examine yourself; scrutinize and observe yourself in divers ways; but mark, before all else, whether it is in philosophy or merely in life itself**[1]** that you have made progress. 3. Philosophy is no trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show. It is a matter, not of words, but of facts. It is not pursued in order that the day may yield some amusement before it is spent, or that our leisure may be relieved of a tedium that irks us. It moulds and constructs the soul; it orders our life, guides our conduct, shows us what we should do and what we should leave undone; it sits at the helm and directs our course as we waver amid uncertainties. Without it, no one can live fearlessly or in peace of mind. Countless things that happen every hour call for advice; and such advice is to be sought in philosophy.

4 Perhaps someone will say: ""How can philosophy help me, if Fate exists? Of what avail is philosophy, if God rules the universe? Of what avail is it, if Chance governs everything? For not only is it impossible to change things that are determined, but it is also impossible to plan beforehand against what is undetermined; either God has forestalled my plans, and decided what I am to do, or else Fortune gives no free play to my plans."" 5. Whether the truth, Lucilius, lies in one or in all of these views, we must be philosophers; whether Fate binds us down by an inexorable law, or whether God as arbiter of the universe has arranged everything, or whether Chance drives and tosses human affairs without method, philosophy ought to be our defence. She will encourage us to obey God cheerfully, but Fortune defiantly; she will teach us to follow God and endure Chance. 6. But it is not my purpose now to be led into a discussion as to what is within our own control, - if foreknowledge is supreme, or if a chain of fated events drags us along in its clutches, or if the sudden and the unexpected play the tyrant over us; I return now to my warning and my exhortation, that you should not allow the impulse of your spirit to weaken and grow cold. Hold fast to it and establish it firmly, in order that what is now impulse may become a habit of the mind.

7 If I know you well, you have already been trying to find out, from the very beginning of my letter, what little contribution it brings to you. Sift the letter, and you will find it. You need not wonder at any genius of mine; for as yet I am lavish only with other men's property. - But why did I say ""other men""? Whatever is well said by anyone is mine. This also is a saying of Epicurus:**[2]** ""If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich."" 8. Nature's wants are slight; the demands of opinion are boundless. Suppose that the property of many millionaires is heaped up in your possession. Assume that fortune carries you far beyond the limits of a private income, decks you with gold, clothes you in purple, and brings you to such a degree of luxury and wealth that you can bury the earth under your marble floors; that you may not only possess, but tread upon, riches. Add statues, paintings, and whatever any art has devised for the luxury; you will only learn from such things to crave still greater.

9 Natural desires are limited; but those which spring from false opinion can have no stopping-point. The false has no limits. When you are travelling on a road, there must be an end; but when astray, your wanderings are limitless. Recall your steps, therefore, from idle things, and when you would know whether that which you seek is based upon a natural or upon a misleading desire, consider whether it can stop at any definite point. If you find, after having travelled far, that there is a more distant goal always in view, you may be sure that this condition is contrary to nature. Farewell.

   ""I stood on the bridge of one of the great liners, ploughing the ocean at 25 knots.  ""She is alive,"" said my companion, ""in every plate; a huge monster with brain and nerves, an immense stomach, a wonderful heart and lungs, and a splendid system of locomotion.""  Just at that moment a signal sounded, and all over the ship the water-tight compartment were closed.  ""Our chief factor of safety,"" said the captain.  ""In spite of the Titanic,"" I said.  ""Yes,"" he replied, ""in spite of the Titanic.""  Now each one of you is a much more marvelous organization than the great liner, and bound on a longer voyage.  What I urge is that you can learn to control the machinery as to live with ""day-tight compartments"" as the most certain way to ensure safety on the voyage.  Get on the bridge and see that at least the great bulkheads are in working order.  Touch a button and hear, at every level of your life, the iron doors shutting out the Past – the dead yesterdays.  Touch another and shut off, with a metal curtain, the Future – the unborn tomorrows.  Then you are safe – safe for today!

 ... The load of tomorrow added to that of yesterday, carried today, makes the strongest falter.  Shut off the future as tightly as the past.  No dreams, no visions, no delicious fantasies, no castles in the air...  The future is today – there is no tomorrow!  The day of a man's salvation is now – the life of the present, of today, lived earnestly, intently, without a forward-looking thought, is the only insurance for the future.  Let the limit of your horizon be a twenty-four hour circle.

.... Shut those, then, the great fore and aft bulkheads, and prepare the cultivate the habit of a life of Day-Tight Compartments.  Do not be discouraged – like every other habit, the acquisition takes time, and the way is one you must find for yourselves.

....Get into touch with the finite, and grasp in full enjoyment that sense of capacity in a machine working smoothly.  Join the whole creation of animate things in a deep heartfelt joy that you are alive, that you see the sun, that you are in this glorious earth which nature has made so beautiful, and which is yours to conquer and to enjoy.  Realize, in the words of Browning, that ""There's a world of capability for joy spread round about us, meant for us, inviting us.""  What are the morning sensations? – for they control the day.  Some of us are congenitally unhappy during the early hours; but the young man who feels on awakening that life is a burden or a bore has been neglecting his machine, driving it too hard, stoking the engines too much, or not cleaning out the ashes and clinkers.

...  Control of the mind as a working machine, the adaptation in it of habit, so that its action becomes almost as automatic as walking, is the end of education – and yet how rarely reached!  It can be accomplished with deliberation and repose, never with hurry and worry.  Realize how much time there is, how long the day is.  Realize that you have sixteen waking hours, three of four at least should be devoted to making a silent conquest of your mental machinery.
Listen to the words of a master in Israel, William James: ""Neither the nature nor the amount of our work is accountable for the frequency and severity of our breakdowns, but their cause lies rather in those absurd feelings of hurry and having no time, in that breathlessness and tension; that anxiety of feature and that solicitude of results, that lack of inner harmony and ease, in short, by which the work with us is apt to be accompanied, and from which a European who would do the same work would, nine out of ten times, be free.""  Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille, but it need not be for all day.  A few hours out of the sixteen will suffice, only let them be hours of daily dedication – in routine, in order and in system, and day by day you will gain in power over the mental mechanism, just as the child does over the spinal marrow in walking, or the musician over the nerve centres.  Aristotle somewhere says that the student who wins out in the fight must be slow in his movements, with voice deep, and slow speech, and he will not be worried over trifles which make people speak in shrill tones and use rapid movements.  Shut close in hour-tight compartments, with the mind directed intensely upon the subject in hand, you will acquire the capacity to do more and more, you will get into training; and once the mental habit is established you are safe for life.

...Four or five hours daily – it is not much to ask; but one day must tell another, one week certify another, one month bear witness to another of the same story...
 Steady work of this sort gives a man a sane outlook on the world.  No corrective so valuable to the weariness, the fever and the fret that are so apt to wring the heart of the young.  This is the talisman, as George Herbert says,

The famous stone
That turneth all to gold,

and with which, to the eternally recurring question, What is Life? you answer, I do not think – I act it; the only philosophy that brings you in contact with its real values and enables you to grasp its hidden meaning.

 Walt Whitman, whose physician I was for some years, never spoke to me much of his poems, though occasionally he would make a quotation; but I remember late one summer afternoon as we sat in the window of his little house in Camden there passed a group of workmen whom he greeted in his usual friendly way.  And then he said: 

""Ah, the glory of the day's work, whether with hand or brain!  I have tried

To exalt the present and the real,

To teach the average man the glory of his

daily work or trade.""

 In this way of life each one of you may learn to drive the straight furrow and so come to the true measure of a man.

Why should you look back to be shocked at the frowsiness and dullness of the students of the seventies or even of the nineties?  And cast no thought forward, lest you reach a period where you and yours will present to your successors the same dowdiness of clothes and times.  But while change is the law, certain great ideas flow fresh through the ages, and control us effectually as in the days of Pericles.  Mankind, it has been said, is always advancing, man is always the same.  The love, hope, fear and faith that make humanity, and the elemental passions of the human heart, remain unchanged, and the secret of inspiration in any literature is the capacity to touch the cord that vibrates in a sympathy that knows not time nor place.""

___


Related to and in harmony with extravagance in houses is all the matter of furnishings within the house—couches, tables, coverlets, drinking cups, and similar objects—completely surpassing all needs and going far beyond necessity. 


There are ivory and silver, yes, even golden couches, tables of similar materials, coverlets of purple and other colors difficult to obtain, cups made of gold and silver, some of marble or some similar material rivalling gold and silver in costliness. 


All these things are eagerly sought for, although a pallet furnishes us a place to lie on no worse than a silver or ivory couch, and a rough cloak is quite as suitable to cover it as a purple or crimson coverlet; it is possible for us to eat quite safely from a wooden table without longing for one of silver. Yes, and one can drink from earthenware cups which are quite as good for quenching the thirst as goblets of gold; and the wine which is poured into them is not tainted, but yields a fragrance sweeter than from cups of gold or silver. 


In general, one would rightly judge what is good and bad in furnishings by these three criteria: acquisition, use, and preservation. Whatever is difficult to obtain or not convenient to use or not easy to protect is to be judged inferior; but what we acquire with no difficulty and use with satisfaction and find easy to keep is superior. 


For this reason earthenware and iron and similar vessels are much better than those of silver or gold, because their acquisition is less trouble since they are cheaper, their usefulness is greater since we can safely expose them to heat and fire (which cannot be done with others) , and guarding them is less of a problem, for the inexpensive ones are less likely to be stolen than the expensive ones. No small part of preserving them too is keeping them clean, which is a more expensive matter with costly ones. 


Just as a horse which is bought for a small price but is able to fulfill many needs is more desirable than one which does little although he was bought for a great price, so in the matter of furnishings the cheaper and more serviceable are better than the more costly and less serviceable ones. 


Why is it, then, that the rare and expensive pieces are sought after rather than those which are available and cheap? It is because the things which are really good and fine are not recognized, and in place of them those which only seem good are eagerly sought by the foolish. As madmen often think that black is white, so foolishness is next of kin to madness.**[1]**


Now we should find that the best lawgivers— and I think first of all of Lycurgus, who drove extravagance out of Sparta and substituted frugality**[2]**, who preferred a life of deprivation as a means of producing courage to a life of excess, and who did away with luxury as a corrupting influence and considered the will to bear hardships the salvation of the state. 


Testimony to this is the endurance of the Spartan ephebes, who were made accustomed to bear hunger and thirst and cold, and even blows and other hardships. Trained in such noble and austere habits the ancient Lacedaemonians were the best of the Greeks and were so esteemed. Their very poverty they caused to be more envied than the King's wealth**[3]**.


For my part, then, I would choose sickness rather than luxury, for sickness harms only the body, but luxury destroys both body and soul, causing weakness and impotence in the body and lack of self-control and cowardice in the soul. 


Furthermore, luxury begets injustice because it also begets covetousness. For no man of extravagant tastes can avoid being lavish in expenditure, nor being lavish can he wish to spend little; but in his desire for many things he cannot refrain from acquiring them, nor again in his effort to acquire can he fail to be grasping and unjust; for no man would succeed in acquiring much by just methods. 


In still another way the man of luxurious habits would be unjust, for he would hesitate to undertake the necessary burdens for his city without abandoning his extravagant life, and if it seemed necessary to suffer deprivation on behalf of his friends or relatives he would not submit to it, for his love of luxury would not permit it. 


Nay more, there are times when duties to the gods must be undertaken by the man who would be just toward them, by performing sacrifices, initiatory rites, or some such other service. Here, too, the wastrel will be found wanting. Thus he would in all ways be unjust toward his city, toward his friends, and toward the gods, in failing to do what it is his duty to do. 


So, then, as being also the cause of injustice, luxury and extravagance must be shunned in every way.

A: In a relating and accepting fashion. Letting them continue their way, regardless of consequences, assuming no one is in physical danger.
(You observe hypocrisy, poor behavior or poor life choices. You choose to accept it. Doing so will likely ensure strong social ties, and let them be)

B: In a passive aggressive, or non militant manner.
(You do not accept their behavior or choices, and have a well executed manner of justly dismissing them; hopefully it's possible to make them question themselves, if only for a second; which has a slight chance of offending or alienating them.)

C: You are appropriately militant, but not overly aggressive. You seek a powerful and well thought out message, possibly a wake up call to call out their behavior or choices for what they are. (You wish to make it known to the individual or group that there is a different world out there than what they perceive, you go out of your way, if even just a step forward to make sure your point is made. Hopefuly they will think twice. There is a pretty good chance that they will be alienated, offended, or aggressive. They way they perceive you may greatly change. You accept must accept this reality and social image regarding whom it may concern.)

My example is I have many aunts, uncles and cousins, who are highly religious Mormons, let alone anyone I'm associated with who is religious. I've came to the conclusion that nearly any form of religion is next to always destructive; from how the families function and how it impacts their decisions, to the way they relate to others, and choose to alienate themselves from others who don't follow their belief. It bends my mind watching my cousins grow up under such influence, sheltered and alienating the outside world because their mommy tells them 'these are bad people.' Or 'I refuse to go to their wedding because it's not in the church.' - more or less. That is just a scoop from the cauldron but much of it grinds my gears, watching these influences, and I believe it's only inhibiting their decision making skills.

I could try accepting it. But I'd always be facing the reality that I see.

I could ignore it, until I'm confronted on it, and equally refute them, or make passive aggressive preparations to be observed, if that makes sense.

Or I could call them out on the ridiculousness of their decisions, alienating a few, and clearly questioning their children (teenagers and a couple adults) why they expect their parents consensus of reality to really be correct. I'd also be acknowledging several issues with other people as well; regarding their confusing view on the world. As I'd be alienated, and causing a scene, I'd be faced with the choice of accepting that none of their opinions really matter, and anything that may be said about me will truly not impact my life or anything I do.

Once when the question arose as to whether or not sons and daughters ought to be given the same education, he remarked that trainers of horses and dogs make no distinction in the training of the male and the female; for female dogs are taught to hunt just as the males are, and one can see no difference in the training of mares, if they are expected to do a horse's work, and the training of stallions. 

In the case of man, however, it would seem to be felt necessary to employ some special and exceptional training and education for males over females, as if it were not essential that the same virtues should be present in both alike, in man and woman, or as if it were possible to arrive at the same virtues, not through the same, but through different instruction. And yet that there is not one set of virtues for a man and another for a woman is easy to perceive. 

In the first place, a man must have understanding and so must a woman, or what pray would be the use of a foolish man or woman? Then it is essential for one no less than the other to live justly, since the man who is not just would not be a good citizen, and the woman would not manage her household well if she did not do it justly; but if she is unjust she will wrong her husband like Eriphyle in the story.**[1]**

Again, it is recognized as right for a woman in wedlock to be chaste, and so is it likewise for a man; the law, at all events, decrees the same punishment for committing adultery as for being taken in adultery. Gluttony, drunkenness, and other related vices, which are vices of excess and bring disgrace upon those guilty of them, show that self-control is most necessary for every human being, male and female alike; for the only way of escape from wantonness is through self-control; there is no other. 

Perhaps someone may say that courage is a virtue appropriate to men only. That is not so.**[2]** For a woman too of the right sort must have courage and be wholly free of cowardice, so that she will neither be swayed by hardships nor by fear; otherwise, how will she be said to have self-control, if by threat or force she can be constrained to yield to shame? Nay more, it is necessary for women to be able to repel attack, unless indeed they are willing to appear more cowardly than hens and other female birds which fight with creatures much larger than themselves to defend their young. How then should women not need courage? That women have some prowess in arms the race of the Amazons demonstrated when they defeated many tribes in war.**[3]** If, therefore, something of this courage is lacking in other women, it is due to lack of use and practice rather than because they were not endowed with it. 

If then men and women are born with the same virtues, the same type of training and education must, of necessity, befit both men and women. For with every animal and plant whatsoever, proper care must be bestowed upon it to produce the excellence appropriate to it. Is it not true that, if it were necessary under like circumstances for a man and a woman to be able to play the flute, and if, furthermore, both had to do so in order to earn a living, we should give them both exactly the same thorough training in flute playing; and similarly if it were necessary for either to play the harp? 

Well then, if it is necessary for both to be proficient in the virtue which is appropriate to a human being, that is for both to be able to have understanding, and self-control, and courage, and justice, the one no less than the other, shall we not teach them both alike the art by which a human being becomes good? Yes, certainly we must do that and nothing else. 

""Come now,"" I suppose someone will say, ""do you expect that men should learn spinning the same as women, and that women should take part in gymnastic exercises the same as men? "" No, that I should not demand. But I do say that, since in the human race man's constitution is stronger and woman's weaker, tasks should be assigned which are suited to the nature of each; that is the heavier tasks should be given to the stronger and lighter ones to the weaker. Thus spinning and indoor work would be more fitting for women than for men, while gymnastics and outdoor work would be more suitable for men. 

Occasionally, however, some men might more fittingly handle certain of the lighter tasks and what is generally considered women's work, and again, women might do heavier tasks which seem more appropriate for men whenever conditions of strength, need, or circumstance warranted. For all human tasks, I am inclined to believe, are a common obligation and are common for men and women, and none is necessarily appointed for either one exclusively, but some pursuits are more suited to the nature of one, some to the other, and for this reason some are called men's work and some women's. But whatever things have reference to virtue, these one would properly say are equally appropriate to the nature of both, inasmuch as we agree that virtues are in no respect more fitting for the one than the other. 

Hence I hold it reasonable that the things which have reference to virtue ought to be taught to male and female alike; and furthermore that straight from infancy they ought to be taught that this is right and that is wrong, and that it is the same for both alike; that this is helpful, that is harmful, that one must do this, one must not do that. From this training understanding is developed in those who learn, boys and girls alike, with no difference. Then they must be inspired with a feeling of shame toward all that is base. When these two qualities have been created within them, man and woman are of necessity self-controlled. And most of all the child who is trained properly, whether boy or girl, must be accustomed to endure hardship, not to fear death, not to be disheartened in the face of any misfortune; he must in short be accustomed to every situation which calls for courage.

Now courage, it was demonstrated above, should be present in women too. Furthermore to shun selfishness and to have high regard for fairness and, being a human being, to wish to help and to be unwilling to harm one's fellow men is the noblest lesson, and it makes those who learn it just. What reason is there why it is more appropriate for a man to learn this? Certainly if it is fitting for women to be just, it is necessary for both to learn the same lessons which are in the highest degree appropriate to the character of each and supremely important. If it happens that a man knows a little something about a certain skill and a woman not, or again she knows something and he not, that suggests no difference in the education of either. But about the all-important things let not one know and the other not, but let them know the same things. 

If you ask me what doctrine produces such an education, I shall reply that as without philosophy no man would be properly educated, so no woman would be. I do not mean that women should possess technical skill and acuteness in argument. It would be quite superfluous, since they will use philosophy for the ends of their life as women. Even in men I do not prize this accomplishment too highly. I only urge that they should acquire from philosophy goodness in conduct and nobility of character. Now in very truth philosophy is training in nobility of character and nothing else.



[1] *The story of Eriphyle, who betrayed her husband Amphiaraus for the sake of a necklace, was commonly cited by the Stoic-Cynic philosophers as the supreme example of treachery. Cf. Epictetus Disc. II, 22, 32 f*.

[2] *The Greek word for courage (cly5peia) means manliness. Apparently Musonius' attempt to justify its appropriate application to women is not mere rhetoric, for Plutarch in his long treatise on the Bravery of Women (Morelia III, pp. 474-580 ed. Babbitt) 2.42E consistently avoids using the word, and is obliged to use the general word for virtue (dPer)*

The problem is this: I've done a pretty good job of figuring out what's important to me in life, and what thing are good, bad and indifferent. But I can't help wanting others to think highly of me in all respects, and this torments me constantly, because I feel like I shouldn't care about it, at least not to this extent.

1. Death deprives us of our ability to act virtuously. It prevents my acting virtuously. Therefore, it should be lamented.

2. Death is something we cannot control. Therefore, it should not be lamented.

Obviously, the Stoics focus more on #2 than #1. But isn't it clear that #1 is also justified within Stoic thought? I should desire to be as virtuous as possible.

1369679312.0,7,self.Stoicism,1f5eer,"On choosing our teachers - Seneca, Letter 52",ThatsOK,9,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1f5eer/on_choosing_our_teachers_seneca_letter_52/,"1 What is this force, Lucilius, that drags us in one direction when we are aiming in another, urging us on to the exact place from which we long to withdraw? What is it that wrestles with our spirit, and does not allow us to desire anything once for all? We veer from plan to plan. None of our wishes is free, none is unqualified, none is lasting. 

2 ""But it is the fool,"" you say, ""who is inconsistent; nothing suits him for long."" But how or when can we tear ourselves away from this folly? No man by himself has sufficient strength to rise above it; he needs a helping hand, and some one to extricate him.

3 Epicurus**[1]** remarks that certain men have worked their way to the truth without any one's assistance, carving out their own passage. And he gives special praise to these, for their impulse has come from within, and they have forged to the front by themselves. Again, he says, there are others who need outside help, who will not proceed unless someone leads the way, but who will follow faithfully. Of these, he says, Metrodorus was one; this type of man is also excellent, but belongs to the second grade. We ourselves are not of that first class, either; we shall be well treated if we are admitted into the second. Nor need you despise a man who can gain salvation only with the assistance of another; the will to be saved means a great deal, too.

4 You will find still another class of man, – and a class not to be despised, – who can be forced and driven into righteousness, who do not need a guide as much as they require someone to encourage and, as it were, to force them along. This is the third variety. If you ask me for a man of this pattern also, Epicurus tells us that Hermarchus was such. And of the two last-named classes, he is more ready to congratulate the one,**[2]** but he feels more respect for the other; for although both reached the same goal, it is a greater credit to have brought about the same result with the more difficult material upon which to work.

5 Suppose that two buildings have been erected, unlike as to their foundations, but equal in height and in grandeur. One is built on faultless ground, and the process of erection goes right ahead. In the other case, the foundations have exhausted the building materials, for they have been sunk into soft and shifting ground and much labour has been wasted in reaching the solid rock. As one looks at both of them, one sees clearly what progress the former has made but the larger and more difficult part of the latter is hidden. 

6 So with men's dispositions; some are pliable and easy to manage, but others have to be laboriously wrought out by hand, so to speak, and are wholly employed in the making of their own foundations. I should accordingly deem more fortunate the man who has never had any trouble with himself; but the other, I feel, has deserved better of himself, who has won a victory over the meanness of his own nature, and has not gently led himself, but has wrestled his way, to wisdom.

7 You may be sure that this refractory nature, which demands much toil, has been implanted in us. There are obstacles in our path; so let us fight, and call to our assistance some helpers. ""Whom,"" you say, ""shall I call upon? Shall it be this man or that?""**[3]** There is another choice also open to you; you may go to the ancients; for they have the time to help you. We can get assistance not only from the living, but from those of the past. 

8 Let us choose, however, from among the living, not men who pour forth their words with the greatest glibness, turning out commonplaces and holding. as it were, their own little private exhibitions,**[4]** – not these, I say, but men who teach us by their lives, men who tell us what we ought to do and then prove it by practice, who show us what we should avoid, and then are never caught doing that which they have ordered us to avoid.

Choose as a guide one whom you will admire more when you see him act than when you hear him speak. 

9 Of course I would not prevent you from listening also to those philosophers who are wont to hold public meetings and discussions, provided they appear before the people for the express purpose of improving themselves and others, and do not practise their profession for the sake of self-seeking. For what is baser than philosophy courting applause? Does the sick man praise the surgeon while he is operating? 

10 In silence and with reverent awe submit to the cure.**[5]** Even though you cry applause, I shall listen to your cries as if you were groaning when your sores were touched. Do you wish to bear witness that you are attentive, that you are stirred by the grandeur of the subject? You may do this at the proper time; I shall of course allow you to pass judgment and cast a vote as to the better course. Pythagoras made his pupils keep silence for five years; do you think that they had the right on that account to break out immediately into applause?

11 How mad is he who leaves the lecture-room in a happy frame of mind simply because of applause from the ignorant! Why do you take pleasure in being praised by men whom you yourself cannot praise? Fabianus used to give popular talks, but his audience listened with self-control. Occasionally a loud shout of praise would burst forth, but it was prompted by the greatness of his subject, and not by the sound of oratory that slipped forth pleasantly and softly. 

12 There should be a difference between the applause of the theatre and the applause of the school; and there is a certain decency even in bestowing praise. If you mark them carefully, all acts are always significant, and you can gauge character by even the most trifling signs. The lecherous man is revealed by his gait, by a movement of the hand, sometimes by a single answer, by his touching his head with a finger,**[6]** by the shifting of his eye. The scamp is shown up by his laugh; the madman by his face and general appearance. These qualities become known by certain marks; but you can tell the character of every man when you see how he gives and receives praise. 

13 The philosopher's audience, from this corner and that, stretch forth admiring hands, and sometimes the adoring crowd almost hang over the lecturer's head. But, if you really understand, that is not praise; it is merely applause. These outcries should be left for the arts which aim to please the crowd; let philosophy be worshipped in silence. 

14 Young men, indeed, must sometimes have free play to follow their impulses, but it should only be at times when they act from impulse, and when they cannot force themselves to be silent. Such praise as that gives a certain kind of encouragement to the hearers themselves, and acts as a spur to the youthful mind. But let them be roused to the matter, and not to the style; otherwise, eloquence does them harm, making them enamoured of itself, and not of the subject.

15 I shall postpone this topic for the present; it demands a long and special investigation, to show how the public should be addressed, what indulgences should be allowed to a speaker on a public occasion, and what should be allowed to the crowd itself in the presence of the speaker. There can be no doubt that philosophy has suffered a loss, now that she has exposed her charms for sale. But she can still be viewed in her sanctuary, if her exhibitor is a priest and not a pedlar. Farewell.

Before I was into Stoicism I was reading more about Objectivism and Humanism. I'm conflicted about being selfish and being altruistic.

I realize in Meditations he say what's good for the community is good for me, and if it harms the community then it's not good. Does this mean he's altruistic?

I like Rand's arguments against altruism, but I also think we're not meant to be entirely selfish either. If we were meant to be entirely selfish, then why has nature created more than one man? If you look in nature, life comes in groups and communities that support themselves.

I understand that we need to be able to be independent enough so that we can feed ourselves, wash ourselves, etc..  We can love ourselves too, but nature has designed us to require the love of others, otherwise we wouldn't reproduce. Nature has also built empathy into us, so that we feel the pain of others. If we were meant to be entirely selfish, we wouldn't have empathy, we would all be sociopaths.

So how does it work?  Are we supposed to be selfish in what we do in the community?  In other words, only if benefiting others benefits us? Sex gives pleasure to both parties. It is win-win. Altruism is lose-win, and pure selfishness is win-lose. Is the stoic ideal win-win? However if everyone was entirely selfish, then everyone wouldn't do anything that was lose-win, people would naturally engage in activities that were win-win.

If it benefits the community it benefits me. Aurelius is suggesting that it must be something that helps many at once, rather than helping someone at once. Giving money to a homeless man is not helping the community, but paying taxes is.

1367257553.0,10,self.Stoicism,1dcmn9,On providence (II) - Epictetus,ThatsOK,10,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1dcmn9/on_providence_ii_epictetus/,"Each single thing that comes into being in the universe affords a ready ground for praising Providence, if one possesses these two qualities—a power to see clearly the circumstances of each, and the spirit of gratitude therewith. Without these, one man will fail to see the usefulness of nature's products and another though he see it will not give thanks for them. If God had created colours and, in general, all visible things, but had not created a faculty to behold them, of what use would they be? None at all. If on the other hand He had created this faculty, but had not created objects of such a nature as to fall under the faculty of vision, even so of what use would it be? None at all. If again He had created both these, and had not created light, even so there would be no use in them. Who is it then that has adapted this to that, and that to this? Who is it that has fitted the sword to the scabbard and the scabbard to the sword? Is there no one? Surely the very structure of such finished products leads us commonly to infer that they must be the work of some craftsman, and are not constructed at random. Are we to say then that each of these products points to the craftsman, but that things visible and vision and light do not? Do not male and female and the desire of union and the power to use the organs adapted for it—do not these point to the craftsman? But if these things are so, then the fact that the intellect is so framed that we are not merely the passive subjects of sensations, but select and subtract from them and add to them, and by this means construct particular objects, nay more, that we pass from them to others which are not in mere juxtaposition—I say are not these facts sufficient to rouse men's attention and to deter them from leaving out the craftsman? If it be not so, let them explain to us what it is which makes each of these things, or how it is possible that objects so marvellously designed should have come into being by chance and at random?

Again, are these faculties found in us alone? Many in us alone—faculties which the rational creature had special need of—but many you will find that we share with irrational creatures. Do they also then understand events and things? No—for using is one thing, and understanding is another. God had need of them as creatures dealing with impressions, and of us as dealing with them and understanding them as well. That is why it is enough for them to eat and drink and rest and breed, and every function is theirs which each irrational creature fulfils; while we, to whom He gave also the power of understanding, cannot be satisfied with these functions, but, unless we act with method and order and consistently with our respective natures and constitutions, we shall no longer attain to our end. For those whose constitutions are different have also different functions and different ends. Therefore that which by constitution is capable only of using things, is satisfied to use them anyhow; but that which by constitution is capable of understanding things as well as using them, will never attain its end, unless to use it adds method also. What is my conclusion? God makes one animal for eating, and another for service in farming, another to produce cheese, and others for different uses of a like nature, for which there is no need of understanding impressions and being able to distinguish them; but He brought man into the world to take cognizance of Himself and His works, and not only to take cognizance but also to interpret them. Therefore it is beneath man's dignity to begin and to end where the irrational creatures do: he must rather begin where they do and end where nature has ended in forming us; and nature ends in contemplation and understanding and a way of life in harmony with nature. See to it then that ye do not die without taking cognizance of these things.

You travel to Olympia, that you may see the work of Phidias, and each of you thinks it a misfortune to die without visiting these sights, and will you have no desire to behold and to comprehend those things for which there is no need of travel, in the presence of which you stand here and now, each one of you? Will you not realize then who you are and to what end you are born and what that is which you have received the power to see?

'Yes, but there are unpleasant and hard things in life.'

Are there none such at Olympia? Are you not scorched with heat? Are you not cramped for room? Is not washing difficult? Are you not wet through when it is wet? Do you not get your fill of noise and clamour and other annoyances? Yet I fancy that when you set against all these hardships the magnificence of the spectacle you bear them and put up with them. And have you not received faculties, which will enable you to bear all that happens to you? Have you not received greatness of spirit? Have you not received courage? Have you not received endurance? If I am of a great spirit what concern have I in what may happen? What shall shake me or confound me or seem painful to me? Instead of using my faculty for the purpose for which I have received it, am I to mourn and lament at the events of fortune?

'Yes, but my rheum flows.'

Slave! What have you hands for then? Is it not to wipe your rheum away?

'Is it reasonable then that there should be rheum in the world?'

Well, how much better it is to wipe your rheum away than to complain! What do you think would have become of Heracles if there had not been a lion, as in the story, and a hydra and a stag and a boar and unjust and brutal men, whom he drove forth and cleansed the world of them? What would he have done, if there had been nothing of this sort? Is it not plain that he would have wrapped himself up and slept? Nay to begin with he would never have been a Heracles at all, had he slumbered all this life in such ease and luxury; and if by any chance he had been, of what good would he have been? What use would he have made of his arms and his might and his endurance and noble heart as well, had not he been stimulated and trained by such perils and opportunities?

'Was it his duty then to contrive these occasions for himself and to seek means to bring a lion, a boar, or a hydra into his country?'

That were madness and folly; but as they had come into being and were found in the world these monsters were of service to display Heracles’ powers and to train them.

It is for you then, when you realize this, to look to the faculties you possess, and considering them to say, 'Zeus, send me what trial Thou wilt; for I have endowments and resources, given me by Thee, to bring myself honour through what befalls.' Nay, instead, you sit trembling for fear of what may happen, or lamenting, mourning, and groaning for what does happen, and then you reproach the gods. What else but impiety indeed can attend upon so ignoble a spirit as yours? And yet God not only gave us these faculties, which will enable us to bear all the issue of events without being humiliated or broken down by it, but, as became a good king and a true father, He gave us this gift free from all let or hindrance or compulsion—nay, He put it wholly in our hands, not even leaving Himself any power to let or hinder us. 

Yet possessing these powers in freedom for your own you refuse to use them and will not realize what gifts you have received and from whose hand, but you sit mourning and grieving, some of you blinded to the giver Himself and refusing to recognize your benefactor, and some from meanness of spirit turning to reproaches and complaints against God. Yet I will show you that you have resources and endowment to fit you for a noble and courageous spirit: show me, if you can, what endowments you have for complaining and reproach.

But it is quality, rather than quantity, that matters; a limited list of reading benefits; a varied assortment serves only for delight. He who would arrive at the appointed end must follow a single road and not wander through many ways. What you suggest is not travelling; it is mere tramping.

2 ""But,"" you say, ""I should rather have you give me advice than books."" Still, I am ready to send you all the books I have, to ransack the whole storehouse. If it were possible, I should join you there myself; and were it not for the hope that you will soon complete your term of office, I should have imposed upon myself this old man's journey; no Scylla or Charybdis or their storied straits could have frightened me away. I should not only have crossed over, but should have been willing to swim over those waters, provided that I could greet you and judge in your presence how much you had grown in spirit.

3 Your desire, however, that I should dispatch to you my own writings does not make me think myself learned, any more than a request for my picture would flatter my beauty. I know that it is due to your charity rather than to your judgment. And even if it is the result of judgment, it was charity that forced the judgment upon you. 4. But whatever the quality of my works may be, read them as if I were still seeking, and were not aware of, the truth, and were seeking it obstinately, too. For I have sold myself to no man; I bear the name of no master. I give much credit to the judgment of great men; but I claim something also for my own. For these men, too, have left to us, not positive discoveries, but problems whose solution is still to be sought. They might perhaps have discovered the essentials, had they not sought the superfluous also. 5. They lost much time in quibbling about words and in sophistical argumentation; all that sort of thing exercises the wit to no purpose. We tie knots and bind up words in double meanings, and then try to untie them.

Have we leisure enough for this? Do we already know how to live, or die? We should rather proceed with our whole souls towards the point where it is our duty to take heed lest things, as well as words, deceive us. 6. Why, pray, do you discriminate between similar words, when nobody is ever deceived by them except during the discussion? It is things that lead us astray: it is between things that you must discriminate. We embrace evil instead of good; we pray for something opposite to that which we have prayed for in the past. Our prayers clash with our prayers, our plans with our plans. 7. How closely flattery resembles friendship! It not only apes friendship, but outdoes it, passing it in the race; with wide-open and indulgent ears it is welcomed and sinks to the depths of the heart, and it is pleasing precisely wherein it does harm. Show me how I may be able to see through this resemblance! An enemy comes to me full of compliments, in the guise of a friend. Vices creep into our hearts under the name of virtues, rashness lurks beneath the appellation of bravery, moderation is called sluggishness, and the coward is regarded as prudent; there is great danger if we go astray in these matters. So stamp them with special labels.

8 Then, too, the man who is asked whether he has horns on his head**[1]** is not such a fool as to feel for them on his forehead, nor again so silly or dense that you can persuade him by means of argumentation, no matter how subtle, that he does not know the facts. Such quibbles are just as harmlessly deceptive as the juggler's cup and dice, in which it is the very trickery that pleases me. But show me how the trick is done, and I have lost my interest therein. And I hold the same opinion about these tricky word-plays; for by what other name can one call such sophistries? Not to know them does no harm, and mastering them does no good. 9. At any rate, if you wish to sift doubtful meanings of this kind, teach us that the happy man is not he whom the crowd deems happy, namely, he into whose coffers mighty sums have flowed, but he whose possessions are all in his soul, who is upright and exalted, who spurns inconstancy, who sees no man with whom he wishes to change places, who rates men only at their value as men, who takes Nature for his teacher, conforming to her laws and living as she commands, whom no violence can deprive of his possessions, who turns evil into good, is unerring in judgment, unshaken, unafraid, who may be moved by force but never moved to distraction, whom Fortune when she hurls at him with all her might the deadliest missile in her armoury, may graze, though rarely, but never wound. For Fortune's other missiles, with which she vanquishes mankind in general, rebound from such a one, like hail which rattles on the roof with no harm to the dweller therein, and then melts away.

10 Why do you bore me with that which you yourself call the ""liar fallacy,""**[2]** about which so many books have been written? Come now, suppose that my whole life is a lie; prove that to be wrong and, if you are sharp enough, bring that back to the truth. At present it holds things to be essential of which the greater part is superfluous. And even that which is not superfluous is of no significance in respect to its power of making one fortunate and blest. For if a thing be necessary, it does not follow that it is a good. Else we degrade the meaning of ""good,"" if we apply that name to bread and barley-porridge and other commodities without which we cannot live. 11 The good must in every case be necessary; but that which is necessary is not in every case a good, since certain very paltry things are indeed necessary. No one is to such an extent ignorant of the noble meaning of the word ""good,"" as to debase it to the level of these humdrum utilities.

12 What, then? Shall you not rather transfer your efforts to making it clear to all men that the search for the superfluous means a great outlay of time, and that many have gone through life merely accumulating the instruments of life? Consider individuals, survey men in general; there is none whose life does not look forward to the morrow. 13. ""What harm is there in this,"" you ask? Infinite harm; for such persons do not live, but are preparing to live. They postpone everything. Even if we paid strict attention, life would soon get ahead of us; but as we are now, life finds us lingering and passes us by as if it belonged to another, and though it ends on the final day, it perishes every day.

But I must not exceed the bounds of a letter, which ought not to fill the reader's left hand.**[3]** So I shall postpone to another day our case against the hair-splitters, those over-subtle fellows who make argumentation supreme instead of subordinate. Farewell.

1363283206.0,7,self.Stoicism,1aao9l,"On the value of retirement - Seneca, Letter 36",ThatsOK,9,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1aao9l/on_the_value_of_retirement_seneca_letter_36/,"1 Encourage your friend to despise stout-heartedly those who upbraid him because he has sought the shade of retirement and has abdicated his career of honours, and, though he might have attained more, has preferred tranquillity to them all. Let him prove daily to these detractors how wisely he has looked out for his own interests. Those whom men envy will continue to march past him; some will be pushed out of the ranks, and others will fall. Prosperity is a turbulent thing; it torments itself. It stirs the brain in more ways than one, goading men on to various aims, – some to power, and others to high living. Some it puffs up; others it slackens and wholly enervates.

2 ""But,"" the retort comes, ""so-and-so carries his prosperity well."" Yes; just as he carries his liquor. So you need not let this class of men persuade you that one who is besieged by the crowd is happy; they run to him as crowds rush for a pool of water, rendering it muddy while they drain it. But you say: ""Men call our friend a trifler and a sluggard."" There are men, you know, whose speech is awry, who use the contrary**[1]** terms. They called him happy; what of it? Was he happy? 3. Even the fact that to certain persons he seems a man of a very rough and gloomy cast of mind, does not trouble me. Aristo**[2]** used to say that he preferred a youth of stern disposition to one who was a jolly fellow and agreeable to the crowd. ""For,"" he added, ""wine which, when new, seemed harsh and sour, becomes good wine; but that which tasted well at the vintage cannot stand age."" So let them call him stern and a foe to his own advancement, it is just this sternness that will go well when it is aged, provided only that he continues to cherish virtue and to absorb thoroughly the studies which make for culture, – not those with which it is sufficient for a man to sprinkle himself, but those in which the mind should be steeped. 4. Now is the time to learn. ""What? Is there any time when a man should not learn?"" By no means; but just as it is creditable for every age to study, so it is not creditable for every age to be instructed. An old man learning his A B C is a disgraceful and absurd object; the young man must store up, the old man must use. You will therefore be doing a thing most helpful to yourself if you make this friend of yours as good a man as possible; those kindnesses, they tell us, are to be both sought for and bestowed, which benefit the giver no less than the receiver; and they are unquestionably the best kind.

5 Finally, he has no longer any freedom in the matter; he has pledged his word. And it is less disgraceful to compound with a creditor than to compound with a promising future. To pay his debt of money, the business man must have a prosperous voyage, the farmer must have fruitful fields and kindly weather; but the debt which your friend owes can be completely paid by mere goodwill. 6. Fortune has no jurisdiction over character. Let him so regulate his character that in perfect peace he may bring to perfection that spirit within him which feels neither loss nor gain, but remains in the same attitude, no matter how things fall out. A spirit like this, if it is heaped with worldly goods, rises superior to its wealth; if, on the other hand, chance has stripped him of a part of his wealth, or even all, it is not impaired.

7 If your friend had been born in Parthia, he would have begun, when a child, to bend the bow; if in Germany, he would forthwith have been brandishing his slender spear; if he had been born in the days of our forefathers, he would have learned to ride a horse and smite his enemy hand to hand. These are the occupations which the system of each race recommends to the individual, – yes, prescribes for him. 8. To what, then, shall this friend**[3]** of yours devote his attention? I say, let him learn that which is helpful against all weapons, against every kind of foe, – contempt of death; because no one doubts that death has in it something that inspires terror, so that it shocks even our souls, which nature has so moulded that they love their own existence; for otherwise**[4]** there would be no need to prepare ourselves, and to whet our courage, to face that towards which we should move with a sort of voluntary instinct, precisely as all men tend to preserve their existence. 9. No man learns a thing in order that, if necessity arises, he may lie down with composure upon a bed of roses; but he steels his courage to this end, that he may not surrender his plighted faith to torture, and that, if need be, he may some day stay out his watch in the trenches, even though wounded, without even leaning on his spear; because sleep is likely to creep over men who support themselves by any prop whatsoever.

In death there is nothing harmful; for there must exist something to which it is harmful.**[5]** 10. And yet, if you are possessed by so great a craving for a longer life, reflect that none of the objects which vanish from our gaze and are re-absorbed into the world of things, from which they have come forth and are soon to come forth again, is annihilated; they merely end their course and do not perish. And death, which we fear and shrink from, merely interrupts life, but does not steal it away; the time will return when we shall be restored to the light of day; and many men would object to this, were they not brought back in forgetfulness of the past.

11 But I mean to show you later,**[6]** with more care, that everything which seems to perish merely changes. Since you are destined to return, you ought to depart with a tranquil mind. Mark how the round of the universe repeats its course; you will see that no star in our firmament is extinguished, but that they all set and rise in alternation. Summer has gone, but another year will bring it again; winter lies low, but will be restored by its own proper months; night has overwhelmed the sun, but day will soon rout the night again. The wandering stars retrace their former courses; a part of the sky is rising unceasingly, and a part is sinking. 12. One word more, and then I shall stop; infants, and boys, and those who have gone mad, have no fear of death, and it is most shameful if reason cannot afford us that peace of mind to which they have been brought by their folly. Farewell.

He is beginning to reveal the character of which he gave promise. Follow up the impulse which prompted you to make for all that is best, treading under your feet that which is approved by the crowd. I would not have you greater or better than you planned; for in your case the mere foundations have covered a large extent of ground; only finish all that you have laid out, and take in hand the plans which you have had in mind. 2. In short, you will be a wise man, if you stop up your ears; nor is it enough to close them with wax; you need a denser stopple than that which they say Ulysses used for his comrades. The song which he feared was alluring, but came not from every side; the song, however, which you have to fear, echoes round you not from a single headland, but from every quarter of the world. Sail, therefore, not past one region which you mistrust because of its treacherous delights, but past every city. Be deaf to those who love you most of all; they pray for bad things with good intentions. And, if you would be happy, entreat the gods that none of their fond desires for you may be brought to pass. 3. What they wish to have heaped upon you are not really good things; there is only one good, the cause and the support of a happy life, – trust in oneself. But this cannot be attained, unless one has learned to despise toil and to reckon it among the things which are neither good nor bad. For it is not possible that a single thing should be bad at one time and good at another, at times light and to be endured, and at times a cause of dread. 4. Work is not a good.**[1]** Then what is a good? I say, the scorning of work. That is why I should rebuke men who toil to no purpose. But when, on the other hand, a man is struggling towards honourable things, in proportion as he applies himself more and more, and allows himself less and less to be beaten or to halt,**[2]** I shall recommend his conduct and shout my encouragement, saying: ""By so much you are better! Rise, draw a fresh breath, and surmount that hill, if possible, at a single spurt!""

5 Work is the sustenance of noble minds. There is, then, no reason why, in accordance with that old vow of your parents, you should pick and choose what fortune you wish should fall to your lot, or what you should pray for; besides, it is base for a man who has already travelled the whole round of highest honours to be still importuning the gods. What need is there of vows? Make yourself happy through your own efforts; you can do this, if once you comprehend that whatever is blended with virtue is good, and that whatever is joined to vice is bad. Just as nothing gleams if it has no light blended with it, and nothing is black unless it contains darkness or draws to itself something of dimness, and as nothing is hot without the aid of fire, and nothing cold without air; so it is the association of virtue and vice that makes things honourable or base.

6 What then is good? The knowledge of things. What is evil? The lack of knowledge of things. Your wise man, who is also a craftsman, will reject or choose in each case as it suits the occasion; but he does not fear that which he rejects, nor does he admire that which he chooses, if only he has a stout and unconquerable soul. I forbid you to be cast down or depressed. It is not enough if you do not shrink from work; ask for it. 7. ""But,"" you say, ""is not trifling and superfluous work, and work that has been inspired by ignoble causes, a bad sort of work?"" No; no more than that which is expended upon noble endeavours, since the very quality that endures toil and rouses itself to hard and uphill effort, is of the spirit, which says: ""Why do you grow slack? It is not the part of a man to fear sweat."" 8. And besides this, in order that virtue may be perfect, there should be an even temperament and a scheme of life that is consistent with itself throughout; and this result cannot be attained without knowledge of things, and without the art**[3]** which enables us to understand things human and things divine. That is the greatest good. If you seize this good, you begin to be the associate of the gods, and not their suppliant.

9 ""But how,"" you ask, ""does one attain that goal?"" You do not need to cross the Pennine or Graian**[4]** hills, or traverse the Candavian**[5]** waste, or face the Syrtes,**[6]** or Scylla, or Charybdis, although you have travelled through all these places for the bribe of a petty governorship; the journey for which nature has equipped you is safe and pleasant. She has given you such gifts that you may, if you do not prove false to them, rise level with God. 10. Your money, however, will not place you on a level with God; for God has no property. Your bordered robe**[7]** will not do this; for God is not clad in raiment; nor will your reputation, nor a display of self, nor a knowledge of your name wide-spread throughout the world; for no one has knowledge of God; many even hold him in low esteem, and do not suffer for so doing. The throng of slaves which carries your litter along the city streets and in foreign places will not help you; for this God of whom I speak, though the highest and most powerful of beings, carries all things on his own shoulders. Neither can beauty or strength make you blessed, for none of these qualities can withstand old age.

11 What we have to seek for, then, is that which does not each day pass more and more under the control of some power which cannot be withstood.**[8]** And what is this? It is the soul, – but the soul that is upright, good, and great. What else could you call such a soul than a god dwelling as a guest in a human body? A soul like this may descend into a Roman knight just as well as into a freedman's son or a slave. For what is a Roman knight, or a freedmen's son, or a slave? They are mere titles, born of ambition or of wrong. One may leap to heaven from the very slums. Only rise





*And mould thyself to kinship with thy God*. **[9]**





This moulding will not be done in gold or silver; an image that is to be in the likeness of God cannot be fashioned of such materials; remember that the gods, when they were kind unto men,**[10]** were moulded in clay. Farewell.

1357838453.0,8,self.Stoicism,16bmjl,How The Acts Appropriate To Man Are To Be Discovered From The Names He Bears - Epictetus ,ThatsOK,9,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/16bmjl/how_the_acts_appropriate_to_man_are_to_be/,"Consider who you are. First, a Man; that is, one who has nothing more sovereign than will, but all else subject to this, and will itself free from slavery or subjection. Consider then from what you are parted by reason. You are parted from wild beasts, you are parted from sheep. On these terms you are a citizen of the universe and a part of it, not one of those marked for service, but of those fitted for command; for you have the faculty to understand the divine governance of the universe and to reason on its sequence. What then is the calling of a Citizen? To have no personal interest, never to think about anything as though he were detached, but to be like the hand or the foot, which, if they had the power of reason and understood the order of nature, would direct every impulse and every process of the will by reference to the whole. That is why it is well said by philosophers that 'if the good man knew coming events beforehand he would help on nature, even if it meant working with disease, and death and maiming', for he would realize that by the ordering of the universe this task is allotted him, and that the whole is more commanding than the part and the city than the citizen. 'But seeing that we do not know beforehand, it is appropriate that we should hold fast to the things that are by nature more fit to be chosen; for indeed we are born for this.'

Next remember that you are a Son. What part do we expect a son to play? His part is to count all that is his as his father's, to obey him in all things, never to speak ill of him to any, nor to say or do anything to harm him, to give way to him and yield him place in all things, working with him so far as his powers allow.

Next know that you are also a Brother. For this part too you are bound to show a spirit of concession and obedience; and to speak kindly, and not to claim against another anything that is outside the will, but gladly to sacrifice those things, that you may gain in the region where your will has control. For look what a thing it is to gain good nature at the price of a lettuce, if it so chance, or the surrender of a chair: what a gain is that!

Next, if you are a member of a city council, remember that you are a councillor; if young, that you are young; if old, that you are old; if a father, that you are a father. For each of these names, if properly considered, suggests the acts appropriate to it. But if you go and disparage your brother, I tell you that you are forgetting who you are and what is your name. I say, if you were a smith and used your hammer wrong, you would have forgotten the smith; but if you forget the brother's part and turn into an enemy instead of a brother, are you going to imagine that you have undergone no change? If instead of man, a gentle and sociable creature, you have become a dangerous, aggressive, and biting brute, have you lost nothing? Do you think you must lose cash in order to suffer damage? Does no other sort of loss damage man? If you lost skill in grammar or music you would count the loss as damage; if you are going to lose honour and dignity and gentleness, do you count it as nothing? Surely those other losses are due to some external cause outside our will, but these are due to ourselves. Those qualities it is no honour to have and no dishonour to lose, but these you cannot lack or lose without dishonour, reproach, and disaster.

What does he lose who is the victim of unnatural lust? He loses his manhood. And the agent of such lust, what does he lose? He loses his manhood like the other, and much besides. What does the adulterer lose? He loses the man of honour and self-control, the gentleman, the citizen, the neighbour. What does the angry man lose? Something else. The man who fears? Something else. No one is evil without destruction and loss.

If on the other hand you look for loss in paltry pence, all the men I have mentioned are without loss or damage, if it so chance, nay they actually receive gain and profit, when they get cash by any of these actions. But notice, that if you make money the standard in everything, you will not count even the man who loses his nose as having suffered injury.

'Yes, I do,' he says, 'for his body is mutilated.'

Well, but does the man who has lost, not his nose but his sense of smell, lose nothing? Is there no faculty of the mind, which brings gain to him that gets it and hurt to him that loses it?

'What can possibly be the faculty you mean?'

Have we no natural sense of honour?

'We have.'

Does he that destroys this suffer no damage, no deprivation, no loss of what belongs to him? Have we not a natural faculty of trust, a natural gift of affection, of beneficence, of mutual toleration? Are we then to count the man who suffers himself to be injured in regard to these as free from loss and damage?

'What conclusion do you draw? Am I not to harm him who harmed me?'

First consider what 'harm' means and remember what you heard from the philosophers. For if good lies in the will and evil also lies in the will, look whether what you are saying does not come to this: 'What do you mean? As he harmed himself by doing me a wrong, am I not to harm myself by doing him a wrong?' Why then do we not look at things in this light? When we suffer some loss in body or property, we count it hurt: is there no hurt, when we suffer loss in respect of our will?

Of course the man who is deceived or the man who does a wrong has no pain in his head or his eye or his hip, nor does he lose his estate; and these are the things we care for, nothing else. But we take no concern whatever whether our will is going to be kept honourable and trustworthy or shameless and faithless, except only so far as we discuss it in the lecture-room, and therefore so far as our wretched discussions go we make some progress, but beyond them not the least.

I took some time to put together the first few entries from some different versions. I know it's just a few entries, but to those who have read this version or that, any thoughts?

George Long, 1862
From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper. From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich. From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.

Martin Hammond, 2006
From my grandfather Verus: decency and a mild temper. From what they say and I remember of my natural father: integrity and manliness. From my mother: piety, generosity, the avoidance of wrongdoing and even the thought of it; also simplicity of living, well clear of the habits of the rich. From my great-grandfather: not to have attended schools for the public; to have had good teachers at home, and to realize that this is the sort of thing on which one should spend lavishly.

Hicks and Hicks, 2002
I am indebted to my grandfather Verus for his good disposition and sweet temper. From my father's reputation and my memory of him, I learned modesty and manliness. From my mother I learned to fear God and to be generous, to refuse not only to do evil but to think it, and a simplicity of life far removed from the habits of the rich. Thanks to my great-grandfather, I didn't have to waste my time in the public schools but had good tutors at home instead and learned that one can not spend too much money on such things.

Maxwell Staniforth, 1964
The example of my grandfather Verus gave me a good disposition, not prone to anger. By the recollection of my father's character, I learned to be both modest and manly. As for my mother, she taught me to have regard for religion, to be generous and open-handed, and not only to forbear from doing anybody an ill turn, but not so much as to endure the thought of it. By her likewise, I was bred to a plain, inexpensive way of living, very different from the common luxury of the rich. I have to thank my great-grandfather that I did not go to a public school, but had good masters at home, and learnt to know that one ought to spend liberally on such things.

___

Thoroughly shameful, he used to say, are gluttony and high living, and no one will dare deny it; yet I have observed very few aiming to shun these vices. On the contrary I notice that the majority of people strive to obtain these same foods when they are not available and when they are at hand are unable to refrain from them, and they use them so lavishly when they have them that they make for the detriment of their health. And yet what else is gluttony but intemperance in the matter of nourishment, causing men to prefer what is pleasant in food to what is beneficial? And high living is nothing but excess in table luxury. 


Now excess is always evil, but here particularly it reveals its true nature in these people since it makes them greedy like swine or dogs rather than men, and incapable of behaving properly with hands, or eyes, or gullet, so completely does the desire for pleasure in dainties of the table pervert them. How shameful it is to behave toward food in this way we may learn from the fact that we liken them to unreasoning animals rather than to intelligent human beings. 


Now if this is shameful, the opposite must be altogether good; that is, exercising moderation and decorum in eating, demonstrating one's self-control there first of all, not an easy thing to do, but one which requires much attention and practice. 


Why should this be? Because although there are many pleasures which lure man into wrong-doing and force him to yield to them contrary to what is good, pleasure in eating is probably the hardest of all to combat. For other pleasures we encounter less often, and we can refrain from some of them for months and whole years, but of necessity we are tempted by this one every day and usually twice a day, since it is not possible for man to live otherwise.


Thus the oftener we are tempted by pleasure in eating, the more dangers there are involved. And indeed at each meal there is not one hazard for going wrong, but many.


First of all, the man who eats more than he ought does wrong, and the man who eats in undue haste no less, and also the man who wallows in the pickles and sauces, and the man who prefers the sweeter foods to the more healthful ones, and the man who does not serve food of the same kind or amount to his guests as to himself.**[1]** 


There is still another wrong in connection with eating, when we indulge in it at an unseasonable time, and although there is something else we ought to do, we put it aside in order to eat. Since, then, these and even more vices are connected with eating, if a man wishes to show self-control, he must be free of all of them and not be guilty of any of them. To keep himself blameless and free from such errors one should by constant practice accustom himself to choosing food not for enjoyment but for nourishment, not to tickle his palate but to strengthen his body.


Indeed the throat was designed to be a passage for food, not an organ of pleasure, and the stomach was made for the same purpose as the root was created in plants. For just as the root nourishes the plant by taking food from without, so the stomach nourishes the living being from the food and drink which are taken into it. And again just as plants receive nourishment that they may survive, and not for their pleasure, so in like manner food is to us the medicine of life. 


Therefore it is fitting for us to eat in order to live, not in order to have pleasure, if, at all events, we wish to keep in line with the wise words of Socrates, who said that the majority of men live to eat but that he ate in order to live.**[2]** Certainly no reasonable being, whose ambition is to be a man, will think it desirable to be like the majority who live to eat, and like them, to spend his life in the chase after pleasure derived from food.

That God who made man provided him food and drink for the sake of preserving his life and not for giving him pleasure, one can see very well from this: when food is performing its real function, it does not produce pleasure for man, that is in the process of digestion and assimilation. 


At that time we are being nourished and renew our strength, but we feel no sensation of pleasure; and yet there is a longer time involved in this process than in eating. Surely if God had planned eating as a pleasure for us, He would have had us enjoy it a longer time and not merely the brief moment when we are swallowing. 


And yet for the sake of that brief moment when we do experience pleasure, countless dainties are prepared, the sea is sailed from end to end, cooks are more in demand than farmers; some even squander the value of their estates to spread their tables, though their bodies are not at all benefited by the costliness of the food. 


Quite the contrary, people who eat the cheapest food are the strongest. Indeed you may notice that slaves are usually stronger than their masters, country men than city men, the poor than the rich, better able to do hard work, less fatigued by their labor, less frequently ill, enduring more cheerfully cold, heat, lack of sleep, and every such hardship. 


Furthermore, even if expensive and cheap food strengthened the body equally well, nevertheless one ought to choose the cheaper food because it is more conducive to temperance and more fitting for a good man. 


In general for men of sense and reason, in respect of food, what is easy to procure is better than what is hard to obtain, what requires no work than what requires it, what is available than what is not at hand. 


But to sum up the question of food, I maintain that its purpose should be to produce health and strength, that one should for that purpose eat only that which requires no great outlay, and finally that at table one should have regard for a fitting decorum and moderation, and most of all should be superior to the common vices of filth and greedy haste.

___


[*That the primary end of marriage is community of life with a view to the procreation of children*.]**[1]** The husband and wife, he used to say, should come together for the purpose of making a life in common and of procreating children, and furthermore of regarding all things in common between them, and nothing peculiar or private to one or the other, not even their own bodies. The birth of a human being which results from such a union is to be sure something marvelous, but it is not yet enough for the relation of husband and wife, inasmuch as quite apart from marriage it could result from any other sexual union, just as in the case of animals. But in marriage there must be above all perfect companionship and mutual love of husband and wife, both in health and in sickness and under all conditions, since it was with desire for this as well as for having children that both entered upon marriage. Where, then, this love for each other is perfect and the two share it completely, each striving to outdo the other in devotion, the marriage is ideal and worthy of envy, for such a union is beautiful.**[2]** But where each looks only to his own interests and neglects the other, or, what is worse, when one is so minded and lives in the same house but fixes his attention elsewhere and is not willing to pull together with his yoke-mate nor to agree, then the union is doomed to disaster and though they live together, yet their common interests fare badly; eventually they separate entirely or they remain together and suffer what is worse than loneliness.

___

There is also another means of livelihood in no way inferior to this, indeed, perhaps it would not be unreasonable to consider it even better for a strong person, namely earning a living from the soil, whether one owns his own land or not.**[1]** For many who are farming land owned either by the state or by other private individuals are yet able to support not only themselves but their wives and children as well; and some in fact attain even a high degree of prosperity by hard work with their own hands.**[2]** For the earth repays most justly and well those who cultivate her, returning many times as much as she received and furnishing an abundance of all the necessities of life to anyone who is willing to work; and this she does without violating one's dignity or self-respect. You may be sure that no one who was not demoralized by soft living would say that the labor of the farmer was degrading or unfit for a good man. How, I ask, could planting trees or ploughing or pruning vines not be honorable? Are not sowing seed and harvesting and threshing all occupations for free men and befitting good men? Even keeping flocks, as it did not disgrace Hesiod nor prevent him from being a poet and beloved of the gods, so it would not prevent anyone else. In fact to me this is the most agreeable of all aspects of farming, because it gives the spirit more leisure to reflect on and to investigate the things that have to do with our own development and training.**[3]** For while, to be sure, the occupations which strain and tire the whole body compel the mind to share in concentration upon them, or at all events, upon the body, yet the occupations which require not too much physical exertion do not hinder the mind from reflecting on some of the higher things and by such reasoning from increasing its own wisdom—a goal toward which every philosopher earnestly strives. For these reasons I recommend particularly the life of a shepherd. But, speaking generally, if one devotes himself to the life of philosophy and tills the land at the same time, I should not compare any other way of life to his nor prefer any other means of livelihood. For is it not ""living more in accord with nature"" to draw one's sustenance directly from the earth, which is the nurse and mother of us all, rather than from some other source? Is it not more like the life of a man to live in the country than to sit idly in the city, like the sophists? Who will say that it is not more healthy to live out of doors than to shun the open air and the heat of the sun? Tell me, do you think it is more fitting for a free man by his own labor to procure for himself the necessities of life or to receive them from others? But surely it is plain that not to require another's help for one's need is more dignified than asking for it. How very good and happy and blessed of heaven is the life of the soil, when along with it the goods of the spirit are not neglected, the example of Myson of Chen may show, whom the god called ""wise,""**[4]** and Aglaus of Psophis whom he hailed as ""happy,""**[5]** both of whom lived on the land and tilled the soil with their own hands, and held aloof from the life of the town. Is not their example worthy of emulation and an incentive to follow in their footsteps and to embrace the life of husbandry with a zeal like theirs?

What, perhaps someone may say, is it not preposterous for an educated man who is able to influence the young to the study of philosophy to work the land and to do manual labor just like a peasant? Yes, that would be really too bad if working the land prevented him from the pursuit of philosophy or from helping others to its attainment. But since that is not so, pupils would seem to me rather benefited by not meeting with their teacher in the city nor listening to his formal lectures and discussions, but by seeing him at work in the fields, demonstrating by his own labor the lessons which philosophy inculcates—that one should endure hardships, and suffer the pains of labor with his own body, rather than depend upon another for sustenance. What is there to prevent a student while he is working from listening to a teacher speaking about self-control or justice or endurance? For those who teach philosophy well do not need many words, nor is there any need that pupils should try to master all this current mass of precepts on which we see our sophists pride themselves; they are enough to consume a whole life-time. But the most necessary and useful things it is not impossible for men to learn in addition to their farm work, especially if they are not kept at work constantly but have periods of rest. Now I know perfectly well that few will wish to learn in this way, yet it would be better if the majority of young men who say they are studying philosophy did not go near a philosopher, I mean those spoiled and effeminate fellows by whose presence the good name of philosophy is stained. For of the true lovers of philosophy, there is not one who would not be willing to live with a good man in the country, even if the place be very rude, since he would be bound to profit greatly from this sojourn by living with his teacher night and day, by being away from the evils of the city, which are an obstacle to the study of philosophy, and from the fact that his conduct, whether good or bad, cannot escape observation—a great advantage to those who are learning. Also to eat and drink and sleep under the supervision of a good man is a great benefit. All these things, which would come about inevitably from living together in the country, Theognis praised in the verses where he says,

""Drink and eat and sit down with good men, and win the approval of those whose influence and power is great.""**[6]**

That he means that none others but good men have great power for the good of men, if one eats and drinks and sits down with them, he has shown in the following:

""From good men you will learn good, but if you mingle with the bad you will destroy even such soul as you had.""**[6]**

Therefore let no one say that farming is an obstacle to learning or to teaching the lessons of duty, for it can scarcely be such an obstacle, if we realize that under these conditions the pupil lives in closest association with the teacher, and the teacher has the pupil constantly at hand.**[7]** And where this is the case, earning a living by farming seems to be most suitable for a philosopher.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________


He said that he himself would never prosecute anyone for personal injury nor recommend it to anyone else who claimed to be a philosopher. For actually none of the things which people fancy they suffer as personal injuries are an injury or a disgrace to those who experience them, such as being reviled or struck or spit upon. Of these the hardest to bear are blows. That there is nothing shameful or insulting about them however is clear from the fact that Lacedaemonian boys are whipped publicly, and they exult in it.**[2]** If, then, the philosopher cannot despise blows and insults, when he ought obviously to despise even death, what good would he be? Well and good, you say, but the spirit of the man who does such things is monstrous, executing his purpose to insult by jeering and a slap in the face, or by abusive language or by some other such action. 

You know, of course, that Demosthenes holds that people can insult even by a glance and that such things are intolerable and that men in one way or another are driven mad by them.**[3]** So it is that men who do not know what is really good and what is shameful, having regard only for common opinion, think they are insulted if someone gives them a malignant glance or laughs or strikes them or reviles them. But the wise and sensible man, such as the philosopher ought to be, is not disturbed by any of these things. He does not think that disgrace lies in enduring them, but rather in doing them. For what does the man who submits to insult do that is wrong? It is the doer of wrong who forthwith puts himself to shame, while the sufferer, who does nothing but submit, has no reason whatever to feel shame or disgrace. Therefore the sensible man would not go to law nor bring indictments, since he would not even consider that he had been insulted. 

Besides, to be annoyed or racked about such things would be petty. Rather he will easily and silently bear what has happened, since this befits one whose purpose is to be noble-minded. Socrates, you remember, was clearly of this frame of mind who, though publicly ridiculed by Aristophanes, was not angry, but when he happened to meet him, asked him if he would like to use him for some other role.**[4]** Can't you imagine how quickly he would have flared up in anger at some petty abuse, this man who showed no concern even when abused in the public theatre! And the good Phocion, when his wife had been reviled by someone, so far from prosecuting the fellow when he came in fear and asked forgiveness of Phocion, saying that he did not know it was his wife whom he had offended, merely replied, ""But my wife has suffered nothing at your hands, though perhaps some other woman has, so you have no need to apologize to me.""**[5]** 

And I might mention many other men who have experienced insult, some wronged by word, others by violence and bodily harm, who do not appear to have defended their rights against their assailants nor to have proceeded against them in any other way, but very meekly bore their wrong. And in this they were quite right. For to scheme how to bite back the biter and to return evil for evil is the act not of a human being but of a wild beast, which is incapable of reasoning that the majority of wrongs are done to men through ignorance and misunderstanding, from which man will cease as soon as he has been taught.**[6]**

But to accept injury not in a spirit of savage resentment and to show ourselves not implacable toward those who wrong us, but rather to be a source of good hope to them is characteristic of a benevolent and civilized way of life. How much better a figure does the philosopher make so conducting himself as to deem worthy of forgiveness anyone who wrongs him, than to behave as if ready to defend himself with legal procedure and indictments, while in reality he is behaving in an unseemly manner and acting quite contrary to his own teaching. To be sure he says that a good man can never be wronged by a bad man;**[7]** but nevertheless he draws up an indictment as having been wronged by bad men, while claiming to be accounted a good man himself.

I believe Taleb is making the point that adversity strengthens stoic virtue and complete serenity achieves the opposite, Seneca makes a similar point in his essay on Providence:

""...I do not mean to say that the brave man is insensible to these, but that he overcomes them, and being in all else unmoved and calm rises to meet whatever assails him. All his adversities he counts mere training. Who, moreover, if he is a man and intent upon the right, is not eager for reasonable toil and ready for duties accompanied by danger? To what energetic man is not idleness a punishment? Wrestlers, who make strength of body their chief concern, we see pitting themselves against none but the strongest, and they require of those who are preparing them for the arena that they use against them all their strength; they submit to blows and hurts, and if they do not find their match in single opponents, they engage with several at a time.

For it often slides back into winter weather. Do you wish to know how uncertain it still is? I do not yet trust myself to a bath which is absolutely cold; even at this time I break its chill. You may say that this is no way to show the endurance either of heat or of cold; very true, dear Lucilius, but at my time of life one is at length contented with the natural chill of the body. I can scarcely thaw out in the middle of summer. Accordingly, I spend most of the time bundled up; 

2 and I thank old age for keeping me fastened to my bed.**[2]** Why should I not thank old age on this account? That which I ought not to wish to do, I lack the ability to do. Most of my converse is with books. Whenever your letters arrive, I imagine that I am with you, and I have the feeling that I am about to speak my answer, instead of writing it. Therefore let us together investigate the nature of this problem of yours, just as if we were conversing with one another.**[3]**

3 You ask me whether every good is desirable. You say: ""If it is a good to be brave under torture, to go to the stake with a stout heart, to endure illness with resignation, it follows that these things are desirable. But I do not see that any of them is worth praying for. At any rate I have as yet known of no man who has paid a vow by reason of having been cut to pieces by the rod, or twisted out of shape by the gout, or made taller by the rack."" 

4 My dear Lucilius, you must distinguish between these cases; you will then comprehend that there is something in them that is to be desired. I should prefer to be free from torture; but if the time comes when it must be endured, I shall desire that I may conduct myself therein with bravery, honour, and courage. Of course I prefer that war should not occur; but if war does occur, I shall desire that I may nobly endure the wounds, the starvation, and all that the exigency of war brings. Nor am I so mad as to crave illness; but if I must suffer illness, I shall desire that I may do nothing which shows lack of restraint, and nothing that is unmanly. The conclusion is, not that hardships are desirable, but that virtue is desirable, which enables us patiently to endure hardships.

5 Certain of our school,**[4]** think that, of all such qualities, a stout endurance is not desirable, – though not to be deprecated either – because we ought to seek by prayer only the good which is unalloyed, peaceful, and beyond the reach of trouble. Personally, I do not agree with them. And why? First, because it is impossible for anything to be good without being also desirable. Because, again, if virtue is desirable, and if nothing that is good lacks virtue, then everything good is desirable. And, lastly, because a brave endurance even under torture is desirable. 

6 At this point I ask you: is not bravery desirable? And yet bravery despises and challenges danger. The most beautiful and most admirable part of bravery is that it does not shrink from the stake, advances to meet wounds, and sometimes does not even avoid the spear, but meets it with opposing breast. If bravery is desirable, so is patient endurance of torture; for this is a part of bravery. Only sift these things, as I have suggested; then there will be nothing which can lead you astray. For it is not mere endurance of torture, but brave endurance, that is desirable. I therefore desire that ""brave"" endurance; and this is virtue.

7 ""But,"" you say, ""who ever desired such a thing for himself?"" Some prayers are open and outspoken, when the requests are offered specifically; other prayers are indirectly expressed, when they include many requests under one title. For example, I desire a life of honour. Now a life of honour includes various kinds of conduct; it may include the chest in which Regulus was confined, or the wound of Cato which was torn open by Cato's own hand, or the exile of Rutilius,**[5]** or the cup of poison which removed Socrates from gaol to heaven. Accordingly, in praying for a life of honour, I have prayed also for those things without which, on some occasions, life cannot be honourable

8 *O thrice and four times blest were they*

*Who underneath the lofty walls of Troy*

*Met happy death before their parents' eyes*! **[6]**

What does it matter whether you offer this prayer for some individual, or admit that it was desirable in the past? 

9 Decius sacrificed himself for the State; he set spurs to his horse and rushed into the midst of the foe, seeking death. The second Decius, rivalling his father's valour, reproducing the words which had become sacred**[7]** and already household words, dashed into the thickest of the fight, anxious only that his sacrifice might bring omen of success,**[8]** and regarding a noble death as a thing to be desired. Do you doubt, then, whether it is best to die glorious and performing some deed of valour? 

10 When one endures torture bravely, one is using all the virtues. Endurance may perhaps be the only virtue that is on view and most manifest; but bravery is there too, and endurance and resignation and long-suffering are its branches. There, too, is foresight; for without foresight no plan can be undertaken; it is foresight that advises one to bear as bravely as possible the things one cannot avoid. There also is steadfastness, which cannot be dislodged from its position, which the wrench of no force can cause to abandon its purpose. There is the whole inseparable company of virtues; every honourable act is the work of one single virtue, but it is in accordance with the judgment of the whole council. And that which is approved by all the virtues, even though it seems to be the work of one alone, is desirable.

11 What? Do you think that those things only are desirable which come to us amid pleasure and ease, and which we bedeck our doors to welcome?**[9]** There are certain goods whose features are forbidding. There are certain prayers which are offered by a throng, not of men who rejoice, but of men who bow down reverently and worship. 

12 Was it not in this fashion, think you, that Regulus prayed that he might reach Carthage? Clothe yourself with a hero's courage, and withdraw for a little space from the opinions of the common man. Form a proper conception of the image of virtue, a thing of exceeding beauty and grandeur; this image is not to be worshipped by us with incense or garlands, but with sweat and blood. 

13 Behold Marcus Cato, laying upon that hallowed breast his unspotted hands, and tearing apart the wounds which had not gone deep enough to kill him! Which, pray, shall you say to him: ""I hope all will be as you wish,"" and ""I am grieved,"" or shall it be ""Good fortune in your undertaking!""?

14 In this connexion I think of our friend Demetrius, who calls an easy existence, untroubled by the attacks of Fortune, a ""Dead Sea.""**[10]** If you have nothing to stir you up and rouse you to action, nothing which will test your resolution by its threats and hostilities; if you recline in unshaken comfort, it is not tranquillity; it is merely a flat calm. 

15 The Stoic Attalus was wont to say: ""I should prefer that Fortune keep me in her camp rather than in the lap of luxury. If I am tortured, but bear it bravely, all is well; if I die, but die bravely, it is also well."" Listen to Epicurus; he will tell you that it is actually pleasant.**[11]** I myself shall never apply an effeminate word to an act so honourable and austere. If I go to the stake, I shall go unbeaten. 

16 Why should I not regard this as desirable – not because the fire, burns me, but because it does not overcome me? Nothing is more excellent or more beautiful than virtue; whatever we do in obedience to her orders is both good and desirable. Farewell.

Even so, as they burn into rage and maybe even lash out physically, everything in my noggin is right where I left it and in control.

""How?"" is a question I've been asking myself in order to loosen the reins of my own control, to little avail, probably because of the logical concept that I won't let go. Questioning reality to the regress has yielded the idea that the only basic verifiable fact is my own existence (would've saved a lot of thinking if I had heard of you before, Descartes), but it doesn't stop there. You see, I've put that into practice. Instead of reacting with, say, anger, I question to regress why such a thing would make me angry, and usually narrow it down to a preconception or something ground into my skull through years in modern society, things told to me that I eventually began telling myself. Once I address the idea, it is generally up to me whether or not I keep it as part of who I am. If I consider it to be parasitic (e.g., I was raised by quite Christian parents with my father being stuck in the '50s mentally, you can only imagine the different weird moralities that come from this) I can remove it by considering it objectively and asking whether or not it is what I really want.

1372970038.0,7,self.Stoicism,1hnjip,"On pleasure and joy - Seneca, Letter 59",ThatsOK,10,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1hnjip/on_pleasure_and_joy_seneca_letter_59/,"1 I received great pleasure from your letter; kindly allow me to use these words in their everyday meaning, without insisting upon their Stoic import. For we Stoics hold that pleasure is a vice. Very likely it is a vice; but we are accustomed to use the word when we wish to indicate a happy state of mind. 

2 I am aware that if we test words by our formula,**[1]** even pleasure is a thing of ill repute, and joy can be attained only by the wise. For ""joy"" is an elation of spirit, of a spirit which trusts in the goodness and truth of its own possessions. The common usage, however, is that we derive great ""joy"" from a friend's position as consul, or from his marriage, or from the birth of his child; but these events, so far from being matters of joy, are more often the beginnings of sorrow to come. No, it is a characteristic of real joy that it never ceases, and never changes into its opposite.**[2]**

3 Accordingly, when our Vergil speaks of

*The evil joys of the mind*, **[3]**

his words are eloquent, but not strictly appropriate. For no ""joy"" can be evil. He has given the name ""joy"" to pleasures, and has thus expressed his meaning. For he has conveyed the idea that men take delight in their own evil. 

4 Nevertheless, I was not wrong in saying that I received great ""pleasure"" from your letter; for although an ignorant**[4]** man may derive ""joy"" if the cause be an honourable one, yet, since his emotion is wayward, and is likely soon to take another direction, I call it ""pleasure""; for it is inspired by an opinion concerning a spurious good; it exceeds control and is carried to excess.

But, to return to the subject, let me tell you what delighted me in your letter. You have your words under control. You are not carried away by your language, or borne beyond the limits which you have determined upon. 

5 Many writers are tempted by the charm of some alluring phrase to some topic other than that which they had set themselves to discuss. But this has not been so in your case; all your words are compact, and suited to the subject, You say all that you wish, and you mean still more than you say. This is a proof of the importance of your subject matter, showing that your mind, as well as your words, contains nothing superfluous or bombastic.

6 I do, however,**[5]** find some metaphors, not, indeed, daring ones, but the kind which have stood the test of use. I find similes also; of course, if anyone forbids us to use them, maintaining that poets alone have that privilege, he has not, apparently, read any of our ancient prose writers, who had not yet learned to affect a style that should win applause. For those writers, whose eloquence was simple and directed only towards proving their case, are full of comparisons; and I think that these are necessary, not for the same reason which makes them necessary for the poets, but in order that they may serve as props to our feebleness, to bring both speaker and listener face to face with the subject under discussion. 

7 For example, I am at this very moment reading Sextius;**[6]** he is a keen man, and a philosopher who, though he writes in Greek, has the Roman standard of ethics. One of his similes appealed especially to me, that of an army marching in hollow square,**[7]** in a place where the enemy might be expected to appear from any quarter, ready for battle. ""This,"" said he, ""is just what the wise man ought to do; he should have all his fighting qualities deployed on every side, so that wherever the attack threatens, there his supports may be ready to hand and may obey the captain's command without confusion."" This is what we notice in armies which serve under great leaders; we see how all the troops simultaneously understand their general's orders, since they are so arranged that a signal given by one man passes down the ranks of cavalry and infantry at the same moment. 

8 This, he declares, is still more necessary for men like ourselves; for soldiers have often feared an enemy without reason, and the march which they thought most dangerous has in fact been most secure; but folly brings no repose, fear haunts it both in the van and in the rear of the column, and both flanks are in a panic. Folly is pursued, and confronted, by peril. It blenches at everything; it is unprepared; it is frightened even by auxiliary troops.**[8]** But the wise man is fortified against all inroads; he is alert; he will not retreat before the attack of poverty, or of sorrow, or of disgrace, or of pain. He will walk undaunted both against them and among them.

9 We human beings are fettered and weakened by many vices; we have wallowed in them for a long time and it is hard for us to be cleansed. We are not merely defiled; we are dyed by them. But, to refrain from passing from one figure**[9]** to another, I will raise this question, which I often consider in my own heart: why is it that folly holds us with such an insistent grasp? It is, primarily, because we do not combat it strongly enough, because we do not struggle towards salvation with all our might; secondly, because we do not put sufficient trust in the discoveries of the wise, and do not drink in their words with open hearts; we approach this great problem in too trifling a spirit. 

10 But how can a man learn, in the struggle against his vices, an amount that is enough, if the time which he gives to learning is only the amount left over from his vices? None of us goes deep below the surface. We skim the top only, and we regard the smattering of time spent in the search for wisdom as enough and to spare for a busy man. 

11 What hinders us most of all is that we are too readily satisfied with ourselves; if we meet with someone who calls us good men, or sensible men, or holy men, we see ourselves in his description, not content with praise in moderation, we accept everything that shameless flattery heaps upon us, as if it were our due. We agree with those who declare us to be the best and wisest of men, although we know that they are given to much lying. And we are so self-complacent that we desire praise for certain actions when we are especially addicted to the very opposite. Yonder person hears himself called ""most gentle"" when he is inflicting tortures, or ""most generous"" when he is engaged in looting, or ""most temperate"" when he is in the midst of drunkenness and lust. Thus it follows that we are unwilling to be reformed, just because we believe ourselves to be the best of men.

12 Alexander was roaming as far as India, ravaging tribes that were but little known, even to their neighbours. During the blockade of a certain city, while he was reconnoitring the walls and hunting for the weakest spot in the fortifications, he was wounded by an arrow. Nevertheless, he long continued the siege, intent on finishing what he had begun. The pain of his wound, however, as the surface became dry and as the flow of blood was checked, increased; his leg gradually became numb as he sat his horse; and finally, when he was forced to withdraw, he exclaimed: ""All men swear that I am the son of Jupiter, but this wound cries out that I am mortal.""**[10]**

13 Let us also act in the same way. Each man, according to his lot in life, is stultified by flattery. We should say to him who flatters us: ""You call me a man of sense, but I understand how many of the things which I crave are useless, and how many of the things which I desire will do me harm. I have not even the knowledge, which satiety teaches to animals, of what should be the measure of my food or my drink. I do not yet know how much I can hold.""

14 I shall now show you how you may know that you are not wise. The wise man is joyful, happy and calm, unshaken, he lives on a plane with the gods. Now go, question yourself; if you are never downcast, if your mind is not harassed by my apprehension, through anticipation of what is to come, if day and night your soul keeps on its even and unswerving course, upright and content with itself, then you have attained to the greatest good that mortals can possess. If, however, you seek pleasures of all kinds in all directions, you must know that you are as far short of wisdom as you are short of joy. Joy is the goal which you desire to reach, but you are wandering from the path, if you expect to reach your goal while you are in the midst of riches and official titles, – in other words, if you seek joy in the midst of cares, these objects for which you strive so eagerly, as if they would give you happiness and pleasure, are merely causes of grief.

15 All men of this stamp, I maintain, are pressing on in pursuit of joy, but they do not know where they may obtain a joy that is both great and enduring. One person seeks it in feasting and self-indulgence; another, in canvassing for honours and in being surrounded by a throng of clients; another, in his mistress; another, in idle display of culture and in literature that has no power to heal; all these men are led astray by delights which are deceptive and short-lived – like drunkenness for example, which pays for a single hour of hilarious madness by a sickness of many days, or like applause and the popularity of enthusiastic approval which are gained, and atoned for, at the cost of great mental disquietude.

16 Reflect, therefore, on this, that the effect of wisdom is a joy that is unbroken and continuous.**[11]** The mind of the wise man is like the ultra-lunar firmament;**[12]** eternal calm pervades that region. You have, then, a reason for wishing to be wise, if the wise man is never deprived of joy. This joy springs only from the knowledge that you possess the virtues. None but the brave, the just, the self-restrained, can rejoice. 

17 And when you query: ""What do you mean? Do not the foolish and the wicked also rejoice?"" I reply, no more than lions who have caught their prey. When men have wearied themselves with wine and lust, when night fails them before their debauch is done, when the pleasures which they have heaped upon a body that is too small to hold them begin to fester, at such times they utter in their wretchedness those lines of Vergil:**[13]**

*Thou knowest how, amid false-glittering joys*.

*We spent that last of nights*.

18 Pleasure-lovers spend every night amid false-glittering joys, and just as if it were their last. But the joy which comes to the gods, and to those who imitate the gods, is not broken off, nor does it cease; but it would surely cease were it borrowed from without. Just because it is not in the power of another to bestow, neither is it subject to another's whims. That which Fortune has not given, she cannot take away. Farewell.

He must have a particularly good memory if he can remember that! But I hope by this time you are living in such a way that I can be sure what it is you are busied with, no matter where you may be. For what else are you busied with except improving yourself every day, laying aside some error, and coming to understand that the faults which you attribute to circumstances are in yourself? We are indeed apt to ascribe certain faults to the place or to the time; but those faults will follow us, no matter how we change our place.

2 You know Harpaste, my wife's female clown; she has remained in my house, a burden incurred from a legacy. I particularly disapprove of these freaks; whenever I wish to enjoy the quips of a clown, I am not compelled to hunt far; I can laugh at myself. Now this clown suddenly became blind. The story sounds incredible, but I assure you that it is true: she does not know that she is blind. She keeps asking her attendant to change her quarters; she says that her apartments are too dark.

3 You can see clearly that that which makes us smile in the case of Harpaste happens to all the rest of us; nobody understands that he is himself greedy, or that he is covetous. Yet the blind ask for a guide, while we wander without one, saying: ""I am not self-seeking; but one cannot live at Rome in any other way. I am not extravagant, but mere living in the city demands a great outlay. It is not my fault that I have a choleric disposition, or that I have not settled down to any definite scheme of life; it is due to my youth."" 4. Why do we deceive ourselves? The evil that afflicts us is not external, it is within us, situated in our very vitals; for that reason we attain soundness with all the more difficulty, because we do not know that we are diseased.

Suppose that we have begun the cure; when shall we throw off all these diseases, with all their virulence? At present, we do not even consult the physician, whose work would be easier if he were called in when the complaint was in its early stages. The tender and the inexperienced minds would follow his advice if he pointed out the right way. 5. No man finds it difficult to return to nature, except the man who has deserted nature. We blush to receive instruction in sound sense; but, by Heaven, if we think it base to seek a teacher of this art, we should also abandon any hope that so great a good could be instilled into us by mere chance.

No, we must work. To tell the truth, even the work is not great, if only, as I said, we begin to mould and reconstruct our souls before they are hardened by sin. But I do not despair even of a hardened sinner. 6. There is nothing that will not surrender to persistent treatment, to concentrated and careful attention; however much the timber may be bent, you can make it straight again. Heat unbends curved beams, and wood that grew naturally in another shape is fashioned artificially according to our needs. How much more easily does the soul permit itself to be shaped, pliable as it is and more yielding than any liquid! For what else is the soul than air in a certain state? And you see that air is more adaptable than any other matter, in proportion as it is rarer than any other.

7 There is nothing, Lucilius, to hinder you from entertaining good hopes about us, just because we are even now in the grip of evil, or because we have long been possessed thereby. There is no man to whom a good mind comes before an evil one. It is the evil mind that gets first hold on all of us. Learning virtue means unlearning vice. 8. We should therefore proceed to the task of freeing ourselves from faults with all the more courage because, when once committed to us, the good is an everlasting possession; virtue is not unlearned. For opposites find difficulty in clinging where they do not belong, therefore they can be driven out and hustled away; but qualities that come to a place which is rightfully theirs abide faithfully. Virtue is according to nature; vice is opposed to it and hostile. 9. But although virtues, when admitted, cannot depart and are easy to guard, yet the first steps in the approach to them are toilsome, because it is characteristic of a weak and diseased mind to fear that which is unfamiliar. The mind must, therefore, be forced to make a beginning; from then on, the medicine is not bitter; for just as soon as it is curing us it begins to give pleasure. One enjoys other cures only after health is restored, but a draught of philosophy is at the same moment wholesome and pleasant. Farewell.

The first is a lifelong martial artist and practices Zen meditation, the second is an entrepreneur with a certain passion for new-age philosophy, especially the ""Sedona Method"", a collection of exercises designed around letting go of your unwanted emotions.

The strange thing is that even though there are very few areas where we overlap intellectually (I for one know nothing about Zen and the Sutras), we seem to live our lives in eerily similar ways. 

One profound experience I remember is when I asked B. to summarize the Sedona Method for me in a few words. He said ""You are not your circumstances, you are not your emotions. Your feelings are not facts, they're not you, and you can let them go"". While the remaining two of us would have worded it differently, this didn't seem that different from what I had learned through Marcus Aurelius (*remove the thought ""I am hurt"" and the hurt itself is removed*) nor what W. had learned through Buddhism. 

We've also embraced a similar approach to life in general:

* Me: Used to be unbelievably lazy, now take seemingly useless challenges (memorize the world's countries, learn Poker on competitive levels) just to experience the ensuing mental battle
* B: Used to be hot-tempered and quick to counter any perceived insult, now ignores all verbal abuse and continues with his job
* W: Used to complain about his lack of career and unfair treatment on the job, now appears to be completely unfazed and helps younger co-workers get promoted.

Within my social circle, those two are the men I feel most at peace with. It's strange that our philosophy comes from different sources, but except our different ""languages"", we understand each other perfectly.

Moreover, I was so impressed and carried along by its charm that I finished it without any postponement. The sunlight called to me, hunger warned, and clouds were lowering; but I absorbed the book from beginning to end.

2 I was not merely pleased; I rejoiced. So full of wit and spirit it was! I should have added ""force,"" had the book contained moments of repose, or had it risen to energy only at intervals. But I found that there was no burst of force, but an even flow, a style that was vigorous and chaste. Nevertheless I noticed from time to time your sweetness, and here and there that mildness of yours. Your style is lofty and noble; I want you to keep to this manner and this direction. Your subject also contributed something; for this reason you should choose productive topics, which will lay hold of the mind and arouse it.

3 I shall discuss the book more fully after a second perusal; meantime, my judgment is somewhat unsettled, just as if I had heard it read aloud, and had not read it myself. You must allow me to examine it also. You need not be afraid; you shall hear the truth. Lucky fellow, to offer a man no opportunity to tell you lies at such long range! Unless perhaps, even now, when excuses for lying are taken away, custom serves as an excuse for our telling each other lies! Farewell.

But consider whether you may not get more help from the customary method**[1]** than from that which is now commonly called a ""breviary,"" though in the good old days, when real Latin was spoken, it was called a ""summary.""**[2]** The former is more necessary to one who is learning a subject, the latter to one who knows it. For the one teaches, the other stirs the memory. But I shall give you abundant opportunity for both.**[3]** A man like you should not ask me for this authority or that; he who furnishes a voucher for his statements argues himself unknown. 2. I shall therefore write exactly what you wish, but I shall do it in my own way; until then, you have many authors whose works will presumably keep your ideas sufficiently in order. Pick up the list of the philosophers; that very act will compel you to wake up, when you see how many men have been working for your benefit. You will desire eagerly to be one of them yourself, for this is the most excellent quality that the noble soul has within itself, that it can be roused to honourable things.

No man of exalted gifts is pleased with that which is low and mean; the vision of great achievement summons him and uplifts him. 3. Just as the flame springs straight into the air and cannot be cabined or kept down any more than it can repose in quiet, so our soul is always in motion, and the more ardent it is, the greater its motion and activity. But happy is the man who has given it this impulse toward better things! He will place himself beyond the jurisdiction of chance; he will wisely control prosperity; he will lessen adversity, and will despise what others hold in admiration. 4 It is the quality of a great soul to scorn great things and to prefer that which is ordinary rather than that which is too great. For the one condition is useful and life-giving; but the other does harm just because it is excessive. Similarly, too rich a soil makes the grain fall flat, branches break down under too heavy a load, excessive productiveness does not bring fruit to ripeness. This is the case with the soul also; for it is ruined by uncontrolled prosperity, which is used not only to the detriment of others, but also to the detriment of itself. 5. What enemy was ever so insolent to any opponent as are their pleasures to certain men? The only excuse that we can allow for the incontinence and mad lust of these men is the fact that they suffer the evils which they have inflicted upon others. And they are rightly harassed by this madness, because desire must have unbounded space for its excursions, if it transgresses nature's mean. For this has its bounds, but waywardness and the acts that spring from wilful lust are without boundaries. 6. Utility measures our needs; but by what standard can you check the superfluous? It is for this reason that men sink themselves in pleasures, and they cannot do without them when once they have become accustomed to them, and for this reason they are most wretched, because they have reached such a pass that what was once superfluous to them has become indispensable. And so they are the slaves of their pleasures instead of enjoying them; they even love their own ills,**[4]** – and that is the worst ill of all! Then it is that the height of unhappiness is reached, when men are not only attracted, but even pleased, by shameful things, and when there is no longer any room for a cure, now that those things which once were vices have become habits. Farewell.

**[1]** *The regular method of studying philosophy was, as we infer from this letter, a course of reading in the philosophers. Seneca deprecates the use of the ""cram"" which is only a memory-help, as a substitute for reading, on the ground that by its use one does not, in the first place, learn the subject, and, in the second place and chiefly, that one loses the inspiration to be derived by direct contact with great thinkers. The request of Lucilius for a cram thus suggests the main topic of the letter, which is taken up in the second paragraph.*

**[2]** *i.e., the word breviarium, ""abridgment,"" ""abstract,"" has displaced the better word summarium, ""outline of chief points.""*

**[3]** *i.e., to do the reading and to review it by means of the summary. The reading will enable Lucilius to identify for himself the authors of the several passages or doctrines.*

**[4]** *i.e., their pleasures. These ills, by being cultivated, become vices.*

I am sure that, if I know you aright, playing the part of an umpire you would have wished that we should be neither like the liberty-capped**[3]** throng in all ways, nor in all ways unlike them; unless, perhaps, this is just the season when we ought to lay down the law to the soul, and bid it be alone in refraining from pleasures just when the whole mob has let itself go in pleasures; for this is the surest proof which a man can get of his own constancy, if he neither seeks the things which are seductive and allure him to luxury, nor is led into them. 4. It shows much more courage to remain dry and sober when the mob is drunk and vomiting; but it shows greater self-control to refuse to withdraw oneself and to do what the crowd does, but in a different way, – thus neither making oneself conspicuous nor becoming one of the crowd. For one may keep holiday without extravagance.

5 I am so firmly determined, however, to test the constancy of your mind that, drawing from the teachings of great men, I shall give you also a lesson: Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ""Is this the condition that I feared?"" 6. It is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence. In days of peace the soldier performs manoeuvres, throws up earthworks with no enemy in sight, and wearies himself by gratuitous toil, in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. If you would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train him before it comes. Such is the course which those men**[4]** have followed who, in their imitation of poverty, have every month come almost to want, that they might never recoil from what they had so often rehearsed.

7 You need not suppose that I mean meals like Timon's, or ""paupers' huts,""**[5]** or any other device which luxurious millionaires use to beguile the tedium of their lives. Let the pallet be a real one, and the coarse cloak; let the bread be hard and grimy. Endure all this for three or four days at a time, sometimes for more, so that it may be a test of yourself instead of a mere hobby. Then, I assure you, my dear Lucilius, you will leap for joy when filled with a pennyworth of food, and you will understand that a man's peace of mind does not depend upon Fortune; for, even when angry she grants enough for our needs.

8 There is no reason, however, why you should think that you are doing anything great; for you will merely be doing what many thousands of slaves and many thousands of poor men are doing every day. But you may credit yourself with this item, – that you will not be doing it under compulsion, and that it will be as easy for you to endure it permanently as to make the experiment from time to time. Let us practise our strokes on the ""dummy"";**[6]** let us become intimate with poverty, so that Fortune may not catch us off our guard. We shall be rich with all the more comfort, if we once learn how far poverty is from being a burden.

9 Even Epicurus, the teacher of pleasure, used to observe stated intervals, during which he satisfied his hunger in niggardly fashion; he wished to see whether he thereby fell short of full and complete happiness, and, if so, by what amount he fell short, and whether this amount was worth purchasing at the price of great effort. At any rate, he makes such a statement in the well known letter written to Polyaenus in the archonship of Charinus.**[7]** Indeed, he boasts that he himself lived on less than a penny, but that Metrodorus, whose progress was not yet so great, needed a whole penny. 10. Do you think that there can be fullness on such fare? Yes, and there is pleasure also, – not that shifty and fleeting Pleasure which needs a fillip now and then, but a pleasure that is steadfast and sure. For though water, barley-meal, and crusts of barley-bread, are not a cheerful diet, yet it is the highest kind of Pleasure to be able to derive pleasure from this sort of food, and to have reduced one's needs to that modicum which no unfairness of Fortune can snatch away. 11. Even prison fare is more generous; and those who have been set apart for capital punishment are not so meanly fed by the man who is to execute them. Therefore, what a noble soul must one have, to descend of one's own free will to a diet which even those who have been sentenced to death have not to fear! This is indeed forestalling the spearthrusts of Fortune.

12 So begin, my dear Lucilius, to follow the custom of these men, and set apart certain days on which you shall withdraw from your business and make yourself at home with the scantiest fare. Establish business relations with poverty.

    Dare, O my friend, to scorn the sight of wealth,
    And mould thyself to kinship with thy God.
**[8]**

13 For he alone is in kinship with God who has scorned wealth. Of course I do not forbid you to possess it, but I would have you reach the point at which you possess it dauntlessly; this can be accomplished only by persuading yourself that you can live happily without it as well as with it, and by regarding riches always as likely to elude you.

14 But now I must begin to fold up my letter. ""Settle your debts first,"" you cry. Here is a draft on Epicurus; he will pay down the sum: ""Ungoverned anger begets madness.""**[9]** You cannot help knowing the truth of these words, since you have had not only slaves, but also enemies. 15. But indeed this emotion blazes out against all sorts of persons; it springs from love as much as from hate, and shows itself not less in serious matters than in jest and sport. And it makes no difference how important the provocation may be, but into what kind of soul it penetrates. Similarly with fire; it does not matter how great is the flame, but what it falls upon. For solid timbers have repelled a very great fire; conversely, dry and easily inflammable stuff nourishes the slightest spark into a conflagration. So it is with anger, my dear Lucilius; the outcome of a mighty anger is madness, and hence anger should be avoided, not merely that we may escape excess, but that we may have a healthy mind. Farewell.

While I have a rudimentary understanding of stoic teachings, I have yet to figure out the stoic view on forgiving those who trespass you - or at least how it can specifically apply to my situation.  I understand the stoic concept of only placing my happiness in something that I can control, and therefore not letting my emotions become ruled by how I am treated by others.  Any and all suggestions on how a novice in stoic thought should proceed are welcome.

In the last two years I have had a major falling out with my sister.  Over the last ten years she has increasingly tried to separate herself from the family.  Moved in with a jerk who manipulated and emotionally hurt her.  She moved out (with our help), only to move back two weeks later.  She moved several states away, and constantly complained about his manipulative behavior.  Long story short, we were all angry with him for hurting her.  Then out of the blue, she announces they are getting married.  I didn’t know what to say, so I didn’t say anything.  While on a family vacation she became so uncontrollably upset because she felt slighted at the fact we were not overjoyed by the prospect of her marriage to this guy that she made several violent gestures in front of my kids and my brother’s kids.  A year later on the day my son was born I attempted to reach out to her and hopefully revive some sort of friendship.  She responded by threatening me if I ever contacted her again.  Six months later she emailed me looking for reconciliation, yet stating that she did not feel any apology was necessary on either of our parts, having come to some conclusion that no one in the universe need apologize for anything, as that was their perfect path in the universe, but basically if I did not feel it was my prerogative to “forget the past” in a sense, then that was my journey as well.  My parents and both my brothers have let her back in without any apology.  I can identify some aspects of stoic thought in her reaction, but here are my concerns at this point (bearing in mind that I do understand not allowing anyone’s actions to determine my own happiness):

1. I’m worried this will be just another event in a long history of her freaking out at the family after she seemed to ‘change’.
2. I’m somewhat displeased with the fact that my family has let her in again without so much as a simple apology for threatening actions in front of and to my kids, and not to mention my brother’s kids.

Marcus Aurelius promoted the quick acceptance of apology of anyone who has hurt or offended you.  But what about the case of someone who has refused to apologize, only seeking to go on as if nothing ever happened per se?  Sorry for the length of this post, but I’m conflicted as how I should proceed.  Thoughts?

I'm not committed to ""joining stoicism"" or anything, but I think I have similar values.

But I have a question that is more personal.  Based on preliminary reading, it sounds like epoche is a sort of bracketing.  Basically, as I read it, it refers to acts such going from desiring something to contemplation of that desire.  I guess the elementary concept is such as desiring to eat when you're on a diet.  I think the problem a lot of people have with dieting is that they go into a state I call ""food lust"".  You're basically just raiding the cupboards and refrigerator looking for food, and you don't even realize that you're doing it.

Another example is a little more complex.  You can determine your emotional state by the thoughts that are entering your mind.  If you're thinking about your girlfriend, you're probably horny.  If you're fantasizing about a desirable woman's boyfriend, you're probably envious.  I don't know if the ancient Stoics thought of these as examples of epoche, but it at least makes the most sense to me.

But here's the issue: I think the idea is to from desire --&gt; epoche --&gt; assent.  The idea is to halt the desire by contemplating it, and then deciding whether or not to assent to the desire i.e. act on it.  But doesn't acting on the desire *after* you have contemplated it *reduce* the desire?  If you decide to fight someone, isn't it best to fight someone *while you are angry*?  If you epoche your anger, and then assent to it, wouldn't it reduce your anger, and make you less capable of using it's primal power?",,False,self,t5_2r4kq,False,,,True,t3_12i4h6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/12i4h6/question_about_epoche_and_related/,

___


At another time when an old man asked him what was the best viaticum for old age, he said, the very one that is best for youth too, namely to live by method and in accord with nature. 

You would best understand what this means if you would realize that mankind was not created for pleasure. 

For that matter, neither was the horse or dog or cow created for pleasure, and all of these creatures are much less valuable than man. Certainly a horse would not be considered to have fulfilled its purpose by eating and drinking and mating at will, and doing none of the things which are the proper work of a horse; no more would a dog if it simply enjoyed all kinds of pleasures like the horse and did none of the things for which dogs are considered good; nor would any other animal if kept from the functions proper to it and allowed to have its fill of pleasures; in short, according to this, nothing would be said to be living according to nature but what by its actions manifests the excellence peculiar to its own nature. 

For the nature of each guides it to its own excellence; consequently it is not reasonable to suppose that when man lives a life of pleasure that he lives according to nature, but rather when he lives a life of virtue. Then, indeed, it is that he is justly praised and takes pride in himself and is optimistic and courageous, characteristics upon which cheerfulness and serene joy necessarily follow. 

In general, of all creatures on earth man alone resembles God and has the same virtues that He has, since we can imagine nothing even in the gods better than prudence, justice, courage, and temperance. Therefore, as God, through the possession of these virtues, is unconquered by pleasure or greed, is superior to desire, envy, and jealousy; is high-minded, beneficent, and kindly (for such is our conception of God), so also man in the image of Him, when living in accord with nature, should be thought of as being like Him, and being like Him, being enviable, and being enviable, he would forthwith be happy, for we envy none but the happy. 

Indeed it is not impossible for man to be such, for certainly when we encounter men whom we call godly and godlike, we do not have to imagine that these virtues came from elsewhere than from man's own nature. 

If, then, by good fortune while still young, one had taken pains to get right instruction, and had mastered thoroughly all those lessons which are considered good, as well as their practical application, such a man in old age using these inner resources would live according to nature, and he would bear without complaint the loss of the pleasures of youth, nor would he fret at the weakness of his body, and he would not be irked even when slighted by his neighbors or neglected by his relatives and friends, since he would have a good antidote for all these things in his own mind, namely his past training. 

If, however, one should have shared less abundantly in early instruction but should show an eagerness for better things and a capacity for following words well-spoken, he would do well if he sought to hear relevant words from those who have made it their business to know what things are harmful and what helpful to men, and in what way one should avoid the former and obtain the latter,**[1]** and how one should patiently accept things which befall him that seem to be evils, but are not really so.**[2]**

If he heard these things and acted upon them (for to hear them without acting upon them would be most unprofitable), he would manage old age very well, and in particular he would rid himself of the fear of death - which more than all else terrifies and oppresses the aged, as though they had forgotten that death is a debt which every man owes. 

Yet it is certain that that which renders life most miserable for the aged is this very thing, the fear of death, as even the orator Isocrates confessed. For they tell that when someone asked how he was getting on, he replied that he was doing as well as was reasonable for a man of ninety, but that he considered death the worst of evils. And yet how could there have been any smattering of knowledge or of acquaintance with true good and evil in the man who thought that an evil which is the necessary sequel even to the best life?**[3]**

The best life, you will agree, is that of a good man, and yet the end even of such a man is death. Therefore, as I said before, if one in old age should succeed in mastering this lesson, to wait for death without fear and courageously, he would have acquired no small part of how to live without complaint and in accordance with nature. He would acquire this by associating with men who were philosophers not in name only but in truth, if he were willing to follow their teachings. 

So it is that I tell you that the best viaticum for old age is the one I mentioned in the beginning, to live according to nature, doing and thinking what one ought. For so an old man would himself be most cheerful and would win the praise' of others, and being thus, he would live happily and in honor. But if anyone thinks that wealth is the greatest consolation of old age, and that to acquire it is to live without sorrow, he is quite mistaken;**[4]** wealth is able to procure for man the pleasures of eating, and drinking and other sensual pleasures, but it can never afford cheerfulness of spirit nor freedom from sorrow in one who possesses it. Witnesses to this truth are many rich men who are full of sadness and despair and think themselves wretched—evidence enough that wealth is not a good protection for old age.

___


A certain young man who wished to study philosophy, but was forbidden by his father to do so, put this question to him ""Tell me, Musonius, must one obey one's parents in all things, or are there some circumstances under which one need not heed them?""**[1]** And Musonius replied, ""That everyone should obey his mother and father seems a good thing, and I certainly recommend it. However, let us see what this matter of obedience is, or rather, first, what is the nature of disobedience, and let us consider who the disobedient person is, if in this way we may better understand what the nature of obedience is.

Now then, take this case. If a father who is not a physician and not experienced in matters of health or sickness should prescribe for his invalid son something which was harmful and injurious, and the son was aware of that fact, surely in not following his father's prescription he is not disobeying and is not disobedient, is he? It would not seem so. Or again, suppose the father himself were ill and should demand wine and food which he ought not to have, and which probably would aggravate his illness if he took it, and his son, realizing this, would not give it to him, surely he is not disobeying his father, is he? Certainly one cannot think so. And yet I fancy one would consider far less disobedient than in this case, the man who, having a money-loving father, is ordered by him to steal or make away with money entrusted to him, but does not carry out the order. Or do you think that there are no fathers who give such orders to their children? Well, I know a father so depraved that, having a son conspicuous for youthful beauty, he sold him into a life of shame. If, now, that lad who was sold and sent into such a life by his father had refused and would not go, should we say that he was disobedient or that he was showing purity of character? Surely even to ask the question is scarcely necessary. To be sure, disobedience and the disobedient person are terms of reproach and shame, but refusing to do what one ought not to do merits praise rather than blame. Therefore whether one's father or the archon or even the tyrant orders something wrong or unjust or shameful, and one does not carry out the order, he is in no way disobeying, inasmuch as he does no wrong nor fails of doing right. He only disobeys who disregards and refuses to carry out good and honorable and useful orders. Such is the disobedient man.

But the obedient person behaves in just the opposite way and is completely different from him; he would be the kind of man who listens to anyone who counsels what is fitting and follows it voluntarily. That is the obedient man. Thus in relation to his parents also, one is obedient when he does voluntarily whatever they counsel that is good and fitting. For my part, moreover, I should say that anyone who did what was right and expedient, even when his parents did not counsel it, was obeying his parents, and in support of my reasoning, consider this. In my opinion the man who does what his father desires and follows his father's wishes is obeying his father; and he who does what he ought and pursues the better course is following the wish of his father. How is that? Because surely all parents have the interests of their children at heart, and because of that interest they wish them to do what is right and advantageous. Consequently one who does what is right and useful is doing what his parents wish and so is obedient to his parents in doing it, even if his parents do not order him in so many words to do these things. This one thing only and nothing else should he take into consideration who wishes to obey his parents in each act—whether what he plans to do is good and advantageous. Thus if such a conviction be entertained, whatever a man's action may be, it is the act of one obedient to his parents.

And so you, my young friend, do not fear that you will disobey your father, if when your father bids you do something which is not right, you refrain from doing it, or when he forbids you to do something which is right you do not refrain from doing it. Do not let your father be an excuse to you for wrong-doing whether he bids you do something which is not right or forbids you to do what is right. For there is no necessity for you to comply with evil injunctions, and you yourself seem not unaware of this. You would certainly not submit to your father in musical matters if, with no knowledge of music, he should order you to play the lyre incorrectly, or if he knew nothing of grammar and you did, he should order you to write and read, not as you had learned but otherwise; and if, finally, with no knowledge of how to steer a ship, he should order you who did understand to handle the helm in the wrong way, you would not heed him. Well, then, enough of that.

Now if your father, knowing nothing about the subject, should forbid you who had learned and comprehended what philosophy is to study philosophy, would you be bound to heed him, or would you not rather be obligated to teach him better, since he is giving bad advice? That seems to me to be the answer. Perhaps by using reason alone one might persuade his father to adopt the attitude he ought in regard to philosophy if the father's disposition is not too obstinate. If, however, he should not be persuaded by argument and would not yield, yet even then the conduct of his son will win him over if his son is truly putting his philosophy into practice. For, as a student of philosophy he will certainly be most eager to treat his father with the greatest possible consideration and will be most well-behaved and gentle; in his relations with his father he will never be contentious or self-willed, nor hasty or prone to anger; furthermore he will control his tongue and his appetite whether for food or for sexual temptations, and he will stand fast in the face of danger and hardships; and finally with competence in recognizing the true good, he will not let the apparent good pass without examination. As a result he will willingly give up all pleasures for his father's sake, and for him he will accept all manner of hardships willingly. To have such a son who would not offer prayers to the gods? Who, having one, would not love him because of whom he had become an envied and most blessed father in the eyes of all men of sound judgment?

If, then, my young friend, with a view to becoming such a man, as you surely will if you truly master the lessons of philosophy, you should not be able to induce your father to permit you to do as you wish, nor succeed in persuading him, reason thus: your father forbids you to study philosophy, but the common father of all men and gods, Zeus, bids you and exhorts you to do so. His command and law is that man be just and honest, beneficent, temperate, high-minded, superior to pain, superior to pleasure, free of all envy and all malice; to put it briefly, the law of Zeus bids man be good. But being good is the same as being a philosopher. If you obey your father, you will follow the will of a man; if you choose the philosopher's life, the will of God.**[2]** It is plain, therefore, that your duty lies in the pursuit of philosophy rather than not. But, you say, your father will restrain you and actually shut you up to prevent your study of philosophy. Perhaps he will do so, but he will not prevent you from studying philosophy unless you are willing; for we do not study philosophy with our hands or feet or any other part of the body, but with the soul and with a very small part of it, that which we may call the reason. This God placed in the strongest place so that it might be inaccessible to sight and touch, free from all compulsion and in its own power. Particularly if your mind is good your father will not be able to prevent you from using it nor from thinking what you ought nor from liking the good and not liking the base; nor again-from choosing the one and rejecting the other. In the very act of doing this, you would be studying philosophy, and you would not need to wrap yourself up in a worn cloak nor go without a chiton nor grow long hair nor deviate from the ordinary practices of the average man. To be sure, such things are well enough for professional philosophers, but philosophy does not consist in them, but rather in thinking out what is man's duty and meditating upon it.""**[3]**

___

Therefore those who contemplate marriage ought to have regard neither for family, whether either one be of high-born parents, nor for wealth, whether on either side there be great possessions, nor for physical traits, whether one or the other have beauty. For neither wealth nor beauty nor high birth is effective in promoting partnership of interest or sympathy, nor again are they significant for producing children. But as for the body it is enough for marriage that it be healthy, of normal appearance, and capable of hard work, such as would be less exposed to the snares of tempters, better adapted to perform physical labor, and not wanting in strength to beget or to bear children. With respect to character or soul one should expect that it be habituated to self-control and justice, and in a word, naturally disposed to virtue. &lt;These qualities should be present in both man and wife.&gt;**[2]** For without sympathy of mind and character between husband and wife, what marriage can be good, what partnership advantageous? How could two human beings who are base have sympathy of spirit one with the other? Or how could one that is good be in harmony with one that is bad? No more than a crooked piece of wood could be fitted to a straight one, or two crooked ones be put together. For the crooked one will not fit another crooked one, and much less the opposite, a crooked with a straight one.**[3]** So a wicked man is not friendly to a wicked one, nor does he agree with him, and much less with a good man.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


When one of the kings from Syria once came to him (for at that time there were still kings in Syria, vassals of the Romans),**[1]** amongst many other things he had to say to the man were the following words in particular. Do not imagine, he said, that it is more appropriate for anyone to study philosophy than for you, nor for any other reason than because you are a king. For the first duty of a king is to be able to protect and benefit his people, and a protector and benefactor must know what is good for a man and what is bad, what is helpful and what harmful, what advantageous and what disadvantageous, inasmuch as it is plain that those who ally themselves with evil come to harm, while those who cleave to good enjoy protection, and those who are deemed worthy of help and advantage enjoy benefits, while those who involve themselves in things disadvantageous and harmful suffer punishment. But to distinguish between good and bad, advantageous and disadvantageous, helpful and harmful is the part of none other than the philosopher, who constantly occupies himself with this very question, how not to be ignorant of any of these things, and has made it his art to understand what conduces to a man's happiness or unhappiness. Therefore it appears that the king should study philosophy. Furthermore it is fitting for a king, or rather it is an absolute necessity for him, to arbitrate justice as between subjects so that no one may have more or less than his just deserts, but may receive honor or punishment as he deserves. But how would anyone who was not just ever be able to manage this? And how would anyone ever be just if he did not understand the nature of justice? Here again is a reason the king should study philosophy, for without such study it would not be plain that he knew justice and the just. For one cannot deny either that the one who has learned it will understand justice better than the one who has not learned it, or that all who have not studied philosophy are ignorant of its nature. The truth of this statement appears from the fact that men disagree and contend with one another about justice, some saying that it is here, others that it is there. Yet about things of which men have knowledge there is no difference of opinion, as for example about white and black, or hot and cold, or soft and hard, but all think the same about them and use the same words. In just the same way they would agree about justice if they knew what it was, but in their very lack of agreement they reveal their ignorance. Indeed I am inclined to think that you are not far from such ignorance yourself, and you ought therefore more than anyone else to concern yourself with this knowledge, the more disgraceful it is for a king than for a private citizen to be ignorant about justice.

In the next place it is essential for the king to exercise selfcontrol over himself and demand self-control of his subjects, to the end that with sober rule and seemly submission there shall be no wantonness on the part of either. For the ruin of the ruler and the citizen alike is wantonness. But how would anyone achieve self-control if he did not make an effort to curb his desires, or how could one who was undisciplined make others temperate? One can mention no study except philosophy that develops self-control. Certainly it teaches one to be above pleasure and greed, to admire thrift and to avoid extravagance; it trains one to have a sense of shame, and to control one's tongue, and it produces discipline, order, and courtesy, and in general what is fitting in action and in bearing. In an ordinary man when these qualities are present they give him dignity and self-command, but if they be present in a king they make him preeminently godlike and worthy of reverence.

Now, since fearlessness and intrepidity and boldness are the product of courage, how else would a man acquire them than by having a firm conviction that death and hardships are not evils? For these are the things, death and hardships, I repeat, which unbalance and frighten men when they believe that they are evils; that they are not evils philosophy is the only teacher. Consequently if kings ought to possess courage, and they more than anyone else should possess it, they must set themselves to the study of philosophy, since they cannot become courageous by any other means.

It is also the prerogative of kings (if they enjoy any whatever) to be invincible in reason and to be able to prevail over disputants by their arguments, just as over their enemies by their arms. Thus when kings are weak in this, it stands to reason that often they are misled and forced to accept the false as the true, which is the price of folly and dense ignorance. Now philosophy by its nature confers upon its devotees perhaps more than anything else the ability to remain superior to others in debate, to distinguish the false from the true, and to refute the one and to confirm the other. Professional speakers, at any rate, whenever they enter into the give and take of argument with philosophers one can see confused and confounded and obliged to contradict themselves. And yet if such speakers, whose business it is to practice debate, are caught because they are inferior to the philosophers in argument, what is bound to happen to other men? Therefore if it is the ambition of anyone who is a king to be powerful in debate, he should study philosophy in order that he may not have to fear that anyone will prevail over him in this, for a king should be completely fearless and courageous and invincible.

In general it is of the greatest importance for the good king to be faultless and perfect in word and action, if, indeed, he is to be a ""living law""**[2]** as he seemed to the ancients, effecting good government and harmony, suppressing lawlessness and dissension, a true imitator of Zeus and, like him, father of his people. But how could anyone be such a king if he were not endowed with a superior nature, given the best possible education, and possessed of all the virtues which befit a man? If, then, there is any other knowledge which guides man's nature to virtue and teaches him to practice and associate with the good, it should be placed beside philosophy and compared with it to see whether it or philosophy is better and more capable of producing a good king. Then the man who wished to become a good king would be wise to use the better one. If, however, no other art professes the teaching and transmission of virtue, though there are some which are concerned solely with man's body and what is useful for it, while others which touch the mind aim at everything else but making it self-controlled,**[3]** yet philosophy alone makes this its aim and occupies itself with this, how a man may avoid evil and acquire virtue, if this I say is so, what else would be more serviceable to a king who wished to be good than the study of philosophy? How better or how otherwise could a man be a good ruler or live a good life than by studying philosophy? For my part, I believe that the good king is straightway and of necessity a philosopher, and the philosopher a kingly person.

Of these two propositions let us examine the former: Is it possible for anyone to be a good king unless he is a good man? No, it is not possible. But given a good man, would he not be entitled to be called a philosopher? Most certainly, since philosophy is the pursuit of ideal good. Therefore a good king is found to be forthwith and of necessity a philosopher also. Now again that the philosopher is entirely kingly you may understand from this. The attribute of a kingly person is obviously the ability to rule peoples and cities well and to be worthy to govern men. Well, then, who would be a more capable head of a city or more worthy to govern men than the philosopher? For it behooves him (if he is truly a philosopher) to be intelligent, disciplined, noble-minded, a good judge of what is just and of what is seemly, efficient in putting his plans into effect, patient under hardship. In addition to this, he should be courageous, fearless, resolute in the face of things apparently disastrous, and besides beneficent, helpful, and humane. Could anyone be found more fit or better able to govern than such a man? No one. Even if he does not have many subjects obedient to him, he is not for that reason less kingly, for it is enough to rule one's friends or one's wife and children or, for that matter, only oneself. For, indeed, a physician who attends few patients is no less a physician than the one who attends many if, to be sure, he has skill and experience in healing. In the same way the musician who teaches only a few pupils is no less a musician than the one who teaches many, provided he knows the art of music. Likewise the horseman who trains only one or two horses is just as much a horseman as the one who trains many if he is skilled in horsemanship. And so the title of kingly person belongs to the one who has only one or two subjects just as well as to the one who has many, only let him have the skill and ability to rule, so that he may deserve the name of king. For this reason it seems to me that Socrates too called philosophy the statesmanlike and royal discipline, because one who masters it immediately becomes a statesman.**[4]** When Musonius said these things, the king was glad at his words and told him that he was grateful for what he said and added, ""In return for this, ask of me whatever you wish for I shall refuse you nothing."" Then Musonius said, ""The only favor I ask of you is to remain faithful to this teaching, since you find it commendable, for in this way and no other will you best please me and benefit yourself.""

When someone asked him if women too should study philosophy, he began to discourse on the theme that they should, in somewhat the following manner. 



Women as well as men, he said, have received from the gods the gift of reason, which we use in our dealings with one another and by which we judge whether a thing is good or bad, right or wrong. Likewise the female has the same senses as the male; namely sight, hearing, smell, and the others. Also both have the same parts of the body, and one has nothing more than the other. Moreover, not men alone, but women too, have a natural inclination toward virtue and the capacity for acquiring it, and it is the nature of women no less than men to be pleased by good and just acts and to reject the opposite of these. If this is true, by what reasoning would it ever be appropriate for men to search out and consider how they may lead good lives, which is exactly the study of philosophy, but inappropriate for women? Could it be that it is fitting for men to be good, but not for women? 



Let us examine in detail the qualities which are suitable for a woman who would lead a good life, for it will appear that each one of them would accrue to her most readily from the study of philosophy. In the first place, a woman must be a good housekeeper; that is a careful accountant of all that pertains to the welfare of her house and capable of directing the household slaves. It is my contention that these are the very qualities which would be present particularly in the woman who studies philosophy, since obviously each of them is a part of life, and philosophy is nothing other than knowledge about life, and the philosopher, as Socrates said, quoting Homer, is constantly engaged in investigating precisely this: "" Whatsoever of good and of evil is wrought in thy halls."" 



But above all a woman must be chaste and self-controlled; she must, I mean, be pure in respect of unlawful love, exercise restraint in other pleasures, not be a slave to desire, not be contentious, not lavish in expense, nor extravagant in dress. Such are the works of a virtuous woman, and to them I would add yet these: to control her temper, not to be overcome by grief, and to be superior to uncontrolled emotion of every kind. Now these are the things which the teachings of philosophy transmit, and the person who has learned them and practices them would seem to me to have become a well-ordered and seemly character, whether man or woman. Well then, so much for self-control. 



As for justice, would not the woman who studies philosophy be just, would she not be a blameless life-partner, would she not be a sympathetic helpmate, would she not be an untiring defender of husband and children, and would she not be entirely free of greed and arrogance? And who better than the woman trained in philosophy— and she certainly of necessity if she has really acquired philosophy —would be disposed to look upon doing a wrong as worse than suffering one (as much worse as it is the baser), and to regard being worsted as better than gaining an unjust advantage? Moreover, who better than she would love her children more than life itself? What woman would be more just than such a one? 



Now as for courage, certainly it is to be expected that the educated woman will be more courageous than the uneducated, and one who has studied philosophy than one who has not; and she will not therefore submit to anything shameful because of fear of death or unwillingness to face hardship, and she will not be intimidated by anyone because he is of noble birth, or powerful, or wealthy, no, not even if he be the tyrant of her city. For in fact she has schooled herself to be high-minded and to think of death not as an evil and life not as a good, and likewise not to shun hardship and never for a moment to seek ease and indolence. So it is that such a woman is likely to be energetic, strong to endure pain, prepared to nourish her children at her own breast, and to serve her husband with her own hands, and willing to do things which some would consider no better than slaves' work. Would not such a woman be a great help to the man who married her, an ornament to her relatives, and a good example for all who know her? 



Yes, but I assure you, some will say, that women who associate with philosophers are bound to be arrogant for the most part and presumptuous, in that abandoning their own households and turning to the company of men they practice speeches, talk like sophists, and analyze syllogisms, when they ought to be sitting at home spinning. I should not expect the women who study philosophy to shirk their appointed tasks for mere talk any more than men, but I maintain that their discussions should be conducted for the sake of their practical application. For as there is no merit in the science of medicine unless it conduces to the healing of man's body, so if a philosopher has or teaches reason, it is of no use if it does not contribute to the virtue of man's soul. 



Above all, we ought to examine the doctrine which we think women who study philosophy ought to follow; we ought to see if the study which presents modesty as the greatest good can make them presumptuous, if the study which is a guide to the greatest self-restraint accustoms them to live heedlessly, if what sets forth intemperance as the greatest evil does not teach self-control, if what represents the management of a household as a virtue does not impel them to manage well their homes. Finally, the teachings of philosophy exhort the woman to be content with her lot and to work with her own hands.



[1] *The Stoics as a group advocated the study of philosophy for women. Cf. Lactantius Inst. Div. III, 25*.

All of us, he used to say, are so fashioned by nature that we can live our lives free from error and nobly; not that one can and another cannot, but all. The clearest evidence of this is the fact that lawgivers lay down for all alike what may be done and forbid what may not be done, exempting from punishment no one who disobeys or does wrong, not the young nor the old, not the strong nor the weak, not anyone whomsoever. And yet if the whole notion of virtue were something that came to us from without, and we shared no part of it by birth, just as in activities pertaining to the other arts no one who has not learned the art is expected to be free from error, so in like manner in things pertaining to the conduct of life it would not be reasonable to expect anyone to be free from error who had not learned virtue, seeing that virtue is the only thing that saves us from error in daily living. Now in the care of the sick we demand no one but the physician to be free from error, and in handling the lyre no one but the musician, and in managing the helm no one but the pilot, but in the conduct of life it is no longer only the philosopher whom we expect to be free from error, though he alone would seem to be the only one concerned with the study of virtue, but all men alike, including those who have never given any attention to virtue. Clearly, then, there is no explanation for this other than that the human being is born with an inclination toward virtue. And this indeed is strong evidence of the presence of goodness in our nature, that all speak of themselves as having virtue and being good. For take the common man; when asked whether he is stupid or intelligent, not one will confess to being stupid; or again, when asked whether he is just or unjust, not one will say that he is unjust. In the same way, if one asks him whether he is temperate or intemperate, he replies at once that he is temperate; and finally, if one asks whether he is good or bad, he would say that he is good, even though he can name no teacher of virtue or mention any study or practice of virtue he has ever made. Of what, then, is this evidence if not of the existence of an innate inclination of the human soul toward goodness and nobleness, and of the presence of the seeds of virtue in each one of us?[2] Moreover, because it is entirely to our advantage to be good, some of us deceive ourselves into thinking that we are really good, while others of us are ashamed to admit that we are not. Why then pray, when one who has not learned letters or music or gymnastics never claims to have knowledge of these arts nor makes any pretence of knowing them, and is quite unable even to name a teacher to whom he went, why, I say, does everyone profess that he has virtue? It is because none of those other skills is natural to man, and no human being is born with a natural faculty [for them, whereas an inclination toward virtue is inborn in each one of us.][3]



[1] *This is the only one of the treatises for which a title is lacking. A satisfactory heading may be supplied from the text at verse 5*.

[2] *Cicero also used this metaphor of the seeds of virtue which exists in every human being. Cf. De Finibus V, 15, 43 and Tusc. Disp. III, 1, 2*.

These are things that should be in my control, like making an effort to run/exercize, spend less time on the internet (I recognize the irony), focus on work, read at night, etc.  However, often when it comes time to actually DO those things, I find ways to excuse myself from my duty.

My self-control is still flabby and out of shape.  I should not use this as an excuse, but rather motivation for continuing my ""exercise.""

I would guess that it is classified as a preferred indifferent. But is it something we pursue, and are right to pursue? I think I'd pursue it no matter what.

IMO, art (I prefer the forms of writing and music) is something magical. When it is of a certain quality, attuned to my tastes and predilections, it brings me somewhere that transcends the banal, the everyday; it brings me to a place that feels whole and unified and lets me know that I am alive--and nothing else has had this profound of an effect on me, not even the Stoics if I weigh them against it. 

Being involved in making art, or exploring the worlds it creates, resonates deeply with me, and I, I just feel connected to something greater than myself when I'm involved with it. 

How many of you Stoics out there are artists? What do you think? Is there a tension, art being something you really love but is an ""indifferent""? What's the most powerful for you, that experience art creates within the person or the effulgent moment of understanding, the insight you are likely to come across in the Stoics? Maybe these two are apples and oranges. 

I just don't hear a lot of practicing or revered Stoics (Epictetus, Marcus, Seneca) talking much about art, which is unfortunate. 

Here's a powerful quote by author Hubert Selby Jr. It's a quote I very much admire:

""Being an artist doesn’t take much, just everything you got. Which means, of course, that as the process is giving you life, it is also bringing you closer to death. But it’s no big deal. They are one in the same and cannot be avoided or denied. So when I totally embrace this process, this life/death, and abandon myself to it, I transcend all this meaningless gibberish and hang out with the gods. It seems to me that that is worth the price of admission.""

___

Such were his opinions on food. He also thought it best to provide moderate covering for the body, not expensive and superfluous, for he said that one ought to use clothing and shoes in exactly the same way as armour, that is for the protection of the body and not for display. 


Therefore just as the most powerful weapons and those best calculated to protect the bearer are the best, and not those which attract the eye by their sheen, so likewise the garment or shoe which is most useful for the body is best, and not one which causes the foolish to turn and stare. For the covering should at once render the thing covered better and stronger than its natural condition, rather than weaker and worse. 


Those, then, who acquire smoothness and delicacy of skin by their clothing make their bodies worse, inasmuch as plainly the pampered and soft body is much worse than one that is sturdy and bears evidence of hard work. 


But those who strengthen and invigorate the body by the clothing they wear, those, I say, are the only ones who benefit the parts of the body so covered. It does not improve the appearance of the body to cover it completely with many garments, to smother it with tight wrappings, and to soften the hands and feet by close fitting gloves or shoes unless perhaps in case of illness. It is not good to be entirely without experience of cold and heat, but one ought in some degree to feel the cold in winter and likewise the heat of the sun in summer and to seek the shelter of shade as little as possible. Wearing one chiton is preferable to needing two, and wearing none but only a cloak is preferable to wearing one. 


Also going barefoot is better than wearing sandals, if one can do it, for wearing sandals is next to being bound, but going barefoot gives the feet great freedom and grace when they are used to it. It is for this reason that one sees couriers wearing no sandals on the highways and the runners in a contest unable to make the best speed if they have to run in sandals.

Since we make houses too for a shelter, I argue that they ought to be made to satisfy bare necessity, to keep out the cold and extreme heat and to be a protection from the sun and the winds for those who need it. 


In general, whatever a natural cave would offer, furnishing a moderate shelter for man, this our houses ought to furnish for us, with just enough to spare to make a convenient place for storing away man's food. 


What good are courtyards surrounded by colonnades? What good are all kinds of colored paints? What good are gold-decked rooms? What good are expensive stones, some fitted together on the floor, others inlaid in the walls, some brought from a great distance, and at the greatest expense? 


Are not all these things superfluous and unnecessary, without which it is possible not only to live but also to be healthy? 


Are they not the source of constant trouble, and do they not cost great sums of money from which many people might have benefited by public and private charity? 


How much more commendable than living a life of luxury it is to help many people. How much nobler than spending money for sticks and stones to spend it on men. How much more profitable than surrounding oneself with a great house to make many friends, the natural result of cheerfully doing good. What would one gain from a large and beautiful house comparable to what he would gain by conferring the benefits of his wealth upon the city and his fellow-citizens?

___

Is it not true that the lawgivers, whose special function it was by careful search to discern what is good for the state and what is bad, what promotes and what is detrimental to the common good, all considered the increase of the homes of the citizens the most fortunate thing for the cities and the decrease of them the most shameful thing? And when the citizens had few or no children did they not regard it as a loss, but when they had children, yes, plenty of them, did they not regard it as a gain? 


So it was for this reason that they forbade women to suffer abortions and imposed a penalty upon those who disobeyed; for this reason they discouraged them from choosing childlessness and avoiding parenthood, and for this reason they gave to both husband and wife a reward for large families, and set a penalty upon childlessness.**[2]** 


How, then, can we avoid doing wrong and breaking the law if we do the opposite of the wish of the lawgivers, godlike men and dear to the gods, whom it is considered good and advantageous to follow? And certainly we do the opposite if we avoid having many children. How can we help committing a sin against the gods of our fathers and against Zeus, guardian of the race, if we do this?


For just as the man who is unjust to strangers sins against Zeus, god of hospitality, and one who is unjust to friends sins against Zeus, god of friendship, so whoever is unjust to his own family sins against the gods of his fathers and against Zeus, guardian of the family, from whom wrongs done to the family are not hidden, and surely one who sins against the gods is impious. 


And that raising many children is an honorable and profitable thing one may gather from the fact that a man who has many children is honored in the city, that he has the respect of his neighbors, that he has more influence than his equals if they are not equally blest with children. I need not argue that a man with many friends is more powerful than one who has no friends, and so a man who has many children is more powerful than one without any or with only a few children, or rather much more so, since a son is closer than a friend. 


One may remark what a fine sight it is to see a man or woman surrounded by their children. Surely one could not witness a procession arrayed in honor of the gods so beautiful nor a choral dance performed in order at a religious celebration so well worth seeing as a chorus of children forming a guard of honor for their father or mother in the city of their birth, leading their parents by the hand or dutifully caring for them in some other way. What is more beautiful than this sight? What is more enviable than these parents, especially if they are good people? For whom would one more gladly join in praying for blessings from the gods, or whom would one be more willing to assist in need?**[3]** Very true, you say, but I am a poor man and quite without means, and if I have many children, from what source should I find food for them all? But pray, whence do the little birds, which are much poorer than you, feed their young, the swallows and nightingales and larks and blackbirds? Homer speaks of them in these words:

""*Even as a bird carries to her unfledged young whatever morsels she happens to come upon, though she fares badly herself*""**[4]**

Do these creatures surpass man in intelligence? You certainly would not say that. In strength and endurance, then? No, still less in that respect. Well, then, do they put away food and store it up? Not at all, and yet they rear their young and find sustenance for all that are born to them. The plea of poverty, therefore, is unjustified.**[5]**

But what seems to me most monstrous of all, some who do not even have poverty as an excuse, and in spite of prosperity and even riches are so inhuman as not to rear later-born offspring in order that those earlier born may inherit greater wealth—by such a deed of wickedness planning prosperity for their surviving children. 


That these may have a greater share of their father's goods, their parents rob them of brothers, never having learned how much better it is to have many brothers than to have many possessions. For possessions inspire intrigue on the part of the neighbors, but brothers discourage intriguers. And possessions need support, but brothers are the strongest supporters. One cannot compare a good friend to a brother nor the help which others, friends and equals, give to that which a brother gives. What good would one compare to the good will of a brother as a pledge of security? What better disposed sharer of common goods could one find than a good brother? Whose presence in misfortune would one desire more than such a brother's? 


For my part I consider the man most enviable who lives amid a number of like-minded brothers, and I consider most beloved of the gods the man who has these blessings at home. Therefore I believe that each one of us ought to try to leave brothers rather than money to our children so as to leave greater assurances of blessings.

___

Again when someone said that marriage and living with a wife seemed to him a handicap to the pursuit of philosophy, Musonius said that it was no handicap to Pythagoras, nor to Socrates, nor to Crates, each of whom lived with a wife, and one could not mention better philosophers than these.**[1]** Crates, although homeless and completely without property or possessions, was nevertheless married; furthermore, not having a shelter of his own, he spent his days and nights in the public porticoes of Athens together with his wife. 



How, then, can we, who have a home to start with and some of us even have servants to work for us, venture to say that marriage is a handicap for philosophy? Now the philosopher is indeed the teacher and leader of men in all the things which are appropriate for men according to nature, and marriage, if anything, is manifestly in accord with nature. For, to what other purpose did the creator of mankind first divide our human race into two sexes, male and female, then implant in each a strong desire for association and union with the other, instilling in both a powerful longing each for the other, the male for the female and the female for the male? Is it not then plain that he wished the two to be united and live together, and by their joint efforts to devise a way of life in common, and to produce and rear children together, so that the race might never die? 



Tell me, then, is it fitting for each man to act for himself alone or to act in the interest of his neighbor also, not only that there may be homes in the city but also that the city may not be deserted and that the common good may best be served?



 If you say that each one should look out for his own interests alone, you represent man as no different from a wolf or any other of the wildest beasts which are born to live by violence and plunder, sparing nothing from which they may gain some advantage, having no part in a life in common with others, no part in cooperation with others, no share of any notion of justice. 



If you will agree that man's nature most closely resembles the bee which cannot live alone (for it dies when left alone) , but bends its energies to the one common task of his fellows and toils and works together with his neighbors; if this is so, and in addition you recognize that for man evil consists in injustice and cruelty and indifference to a neighbor's trouble, while virtue is brotherly love and goodness and justice and beneficence and concern for the welfare of one's neighbor—with such ideas, I say, it would be each man's duty to take thought for his own city, and to make of his home a rampart for its protection. 



But the first step toward making his home such a rampart is marriage. Thus whoever destroys human marriage destroys the home, the city, and the whole human race. For it would not last if there were no procreation of children and there would be no just and lawful procreation of children without marriage. That the home or the city does not depend upon women alone or upon men alone, but upon their union with each other is evident. One could find no other association more necessary nor more pleasant than that of men and women. For what man is so devoted to his friend as a loving wife is to her husband? What brother to a brother? What son to his parents? Who is so longed for when absent as a husband by his wife, or a wife by her husband? Whose presence would do more to lighten grief or increase joy or remedy misfortune? To whom is everything judged to be common, body, soul, and possessions, except man and wife?



For these reasons all men consider the love of man and wife to be the highest form of love; and no reasonable mother or father would expect to entertain a deeper love for his own child than for the one joined to him in marriage. Indeed how much the love of a wife for her husband surpasses the love of parents for their children is clearly illustrated by the familiar story of how Admetus,**[2]** receiving from the gods the privilege of living twice the time allotted to him if he could get someone else to die in his place, found his parents unwilling to die for him although they were old, but his wedded wife Alcestis, though still very young, readily accepted death ill her husband's place.



How great and worthy an estate is marriage is plain from this also, that gods watch over it, great gods, too, in the estimation of men; first Hera (and for this reason we address her as the patroness of wedlock) , then Eros, then Aphrodite, for we assume that all of these perform the function of bringing together man and woman for the procreation of children. 



Where, indeed, does Eros more properly belong than in the lawful union of man and wife? Where Hera? Where Aphrodite? When would one more appropriately pray to these divinities than when entering into marriage? What should we more properly call the work of Aphrodite than the joining of wife and husband? Why, then, should anyone say that such great divinities watch over and guard marriage and the procreation of children, unless these things are the proper concern of man? Why should one say that they are the proper concern of man but not the concern of the philosopher? Can it be because the philosopher is worse than other men? Certainly he ought not to be worse, but better and more just and more truly good. Or could one say that the man who does not take an interest in his city is not worse and more unjust than the man who does, the man who looks out only for his own interests is not worse than the one who looks out for the common good? Or can it be that the man who chooses the single life is more patriotic, more a friend and partner of his fellow-man, than the man who maintains a home and rears children and contributes to the growth of his city, which is exactly what a married man does?




It is clear, therefore, that it is fitting for a philosopher to concern himself with marriage and having children. And if this is fitting, how, my young friend, could that argument of yours that marriage is a handicap for a philosopher ever be sound? For manifestly the study of philosophy is nothing else than to search out by reason what is right and proper and by deeds to put it into practice. Such, then, were the words he spoke at that time.

___


Not the least significant part of the life of luxury and selfindulgence lies also in sexual excess; for example those who lead such a life crave a variety of loves not only lawful but unlawful ones as well, not women alone but also men; sometimes they pursue one love and sometimes another, and not being satisfied with those which are available, pursue those which are rare and inaccessible, and invent shameful intimacies, all of which constitute a grave indictment of manhood. Men who are not wantons or immoral are bound to consider sexual intercourse justified only when it occurs in marriage and is indulged in for the purpose of begetting children, since that is lawful, but unjust and unlawful when it is mere pleasure-seeking, even in marriage. But of all sexual relations those involving adultery are most unlawful, and no more tolerable are those of men with men, because it is a monstrous thing and contrary to nature. But, furthermore, leaving out of consideration adultery, all intercourse with women which is without lawful character is shameful and is practiced from lack of self-restraint. So no one with any self-control would think of having relations with a courtesan or a free woman apart from marriage, no, nor even with his own maid-servant. The fact that those relationships are not lawful or seemly makes them a disgrace and a reproach to those seeking them; whence it is that no one dares to do any of these things openly, not even if he has all but lost the ability to blush, and those who are not completely degenerate dare to do these things only in hiding and in secret. And yet to attempt to cover up what one is doing is equivalent to a confession of guilt. ""That's all very well,"" you say, ""but unlike the adulterer who wrongs the husband of the woman he corrupts, the man who has relations with a courtesan or a woman who has no husband wrongs no one for he does not destroy anyone's hope of children."" I continue to maintain that everyone who sins and does wrong, even if it affects none of the people about him, yet immediately reveals himself as a worse and a less honorable person; for the wrong-doer by the very fact of doing wrong is worse and less honorable. Not to mention the injustice of the thing, there must be sheer wantonness in anyone yielding to the temptation of shameful pleasure and like swine rejoicing in his own vileness. In this category belongs the man who has relations with his own slave-maid, a thing which some people consider quite without blame, since every master is held to have it in his power to use his slave as he wishes. In reply to this I have just one thing to say: if it seems neither shameful nor out of place for a master to have relations with his own slave, particularly if she happens to be unmarried, let him consider how he would like it if his wife had relations with a male slave. Would it not seem completely intolerable not only if the woman who had a lawful husband had relations with a slave, but even if a woman without a husband should have? And yet surely one will not expect men to be less moral than women, nor less capable of disciplining their desires, thereby revealing the stronger in judgment inferior to the weaker, the rulers to the ruled. In fact, it behooves men to be much better if they expect to be superior to women, for surely if they appear to be less self-controlled they will also be baser characters. What need is there to say that it is an act of licentiousness and nothing less for a master to have relations with a slave? Everyone knows that.

[1] *Every editor of Musonius and of Epictetus has expressed his dissatisfaction with the text of this fragment, but none has suggested the solution. From the preceding context in Epictetus, the meaning is that a man must get from himself what he needs for his comfort or security, and not from another or with the help of another. Here Musonius, testing the young slave Epictetus to see how well he had learned the lesson, mentions the ill-treatment he would suffer from his master Epaphroditus. Professor Hendrickson conjectures that after ’ανρώπινα something has been lost from the text, possibly (ποιοϊς ’αν περί μου παραιτούμενος) and that ’ανρώπινα is used in the sense of ’ανρωπίνως. Following this interpretation, Epictetus, by asking Musonius to intercede for him, shows that he has not learned the lesson*.

Book 4:  ""...men are not intentional evildoers"".  Earlier passages state that bad actions are the result of ignorance or misunderstanding.

I'm not convinced.  Some people are bad, even evil, and do horrible things merely for the sake of wrongdoing, among other dark motives.  

Of course the Emperor of Rome probably witnessed more evil in a week than I will see in a lifetime.  How is it that he could bring himself to believe that men don't purposely do wrong, that if they simply understood their proper relationship to the world that they would then do right?  Or do I misunderstand?

I see his purpose in at least one sense:  the bad actions of others are beyond our control, so we must not be disturbed by them.  However, that is a far-cry from claiming that their bad actions are unintentional.

We cast off when the sea was lazily smooth; the sky, to be sure, was heavy with nasty clouds, such as usually break into rain or squalls. Still, I thought that the few miles between Puteoli and your dear Parthenope**[1]** might be run off in quick time, despite the uncertain and lowering sky. So, in order to get away more quickly, I made straight out to sea for Nesis,**[2]** with the purpose of cutting across all the inlets. 

2 But when we were so far out that it made little difference to me whether I returned or kept on, the calm weather, which had enticed me, came to naught. The storm had not yet begun, but the ground-swell was on, and the waves kept steadily coming faster. I began to ask the pilot to put me ashore somewhere; he replied that the coast was rough and a bad place to land, and that in a storm he feared a lee shore more than anything else. 

3 But I was suffering too grievously to think of the danger, since a sluggish seasickness which brought no relief was racking me, the sort that upsets the liver without clearing it. Therefore I laid down the law to my pilot, forcing him to make for the shore, willy-nilly. When we drew near, I did not wait for things to be done in accordance with Vergil's orders, until

*Prow faced seawards* **[3]**

*or*

*Anchor plunged from bow*; **[4]**

I remembered my profession**[5]** as a veteran devotee of cold water, and, clad as I was in my cloak, let myself down into the sea, just as a cold-water bather should. 

4 What do you think my feelings were, scrambling over the rocks, searching out the path, or making one for myself? l understood that sailors have good reason to fear the land. It is hard to believe what I endured when I could not endure myself; you may be sure that the reason why Ulysses was shipwrecked on every possible occasion was not so much because the sea-god was angry with him from his birth; he was simply subject to seasickness. And in the future I also, if I must go anywhere by sea, shall only reach my destination in the twentieth year.**[6]**

5 When I finally calmed my stomach (for you know that one does not escape seasickness by escaping from the sea) and refreshed my body with a rubdown, I began to reflect how completely we forget or ignore our failings, even those that affect the body, which are continually reminding us of their existence, – not to mention those which are more serious in proportion as they are more hidden. 

6 A slight ague deceives us; but when it has increased and a genuine fever has begun to burn, it forces even a hardy man, who can endure much suffering, to admit that he is ill. There is pain in the foot, and a tingling sensation in the joints; but we still hide the complaint and announce that we have sprained a joint, or else are tired from over-exercise. Then the ailment, uncertain at first, must be given a name; and when it begins to swell the ankles also, and has made both our feet ""right"" feet,**[7]** we are bound to confess that we have the gout. 

7 The opposite holds true of diseases of the soul; the worse one is, the less one perceives it. You need not be surprised, my beloved Lucilius. For he whose sleep is light pursues visions during slumber, and sometimes, though asleep, is conscious that he is asleep; but sound slumber annihilates our very dreams and sinks the spirit down so deep that it has no perception of self. 

8 Why will no man confess his faults? Because he is still in their grasp; only he who is awake can recount his dream, and similarly a confession of sin is a proof of sound mind.

Let us, therefore, rouse ourselves, that we may be able to correct our mistakes. Philosophy, however, is the only power that can stir us, the only power that can shake off our deep slumber. Devote yourself wholly to philosophy. You are worthy of her; she is worthy of you; greet one another with a loving embrace. Say farewell to all other interests with courage and frankness. Do not study philosophy merely during your spare time.**[8]**

9 If you were ill, you would stop caring for your personal concerns, and forget your business duties; you would not think highly enough of any client to take active charge of his case during a slight abatement of your sufferings. You would try your hardest to be rid of the illness as soon as possible. What, then? Shall you not do the same thing now? Throw aside all hindrances and give up your time to getting a sound mind; for no man can attain it if he is engrossed in other matters. Philosophy wields her own authority; she appoints her own time and does not allow it to be appointed for her. She is not a thing to be followed at odd times, but a subject for daily practice; she is mistress, and she commands our attendance. 

10 Alexander, when a certain state promised him a part of its territory and half its entire property, replied: ""I invaded Asia with the intention, not of accepting what you might give, but of allowing you to keep what I might leave."" Philosophy likewise keeps saying to all occupations: ""I do not intend to accept the time which you have left over, but I shall allow you to keep what I myself shall leave.""

11 Turn to her, therefore, with all your soul, sit at her feet, cherish her; a great distance will then begin to separate you from other men. You will be far ahead of all mortals, and even the gods will not be far ahead of you. Do you ask what will be the difference between yourself and the gods? They will live longer. But, by my faith, it is the sign of a great artist to have confined a full likeness to the limits of a miniature. The wise man's life spreads out to him over as large a surface as does all eternity to a god. There is one point in which the sage has an advantage over the god; for a god is freed from terrors by the bounty of nature, the wise man by his own bounty. 

12 What a wonderful privilege, to have the weaknesses of a man and the serenity of a god! The power of philosophy to blunt the blows of chance is beyond belief. No missile can settle in her body; she is well-protected and impenetrable. She spoils the force of some missiles and wards them off with the loose folds of her gown, as if they had no power to harm; others she dashes aside, and hurls them back with such force that they recoil upon the sender. Farewell.

For others perhaps it may be shameful that an honest man starves; but how can it be shameful for him, himself? how can it be his shame, if not his fault? Can a man on any other occasion dies as becomes a man, die generously and nobly; and cannot he in the same manner starve as generously and nobly, and with as good a heart? What is there that can hinder? Say, what is generosity? What magnanimity? And where else can these be shown, where practiced besides, if not here?...

Remember that in the use of appearances, one of the chief parts is the inversion, change, and transforming of fancies and appearances and the wresting of them from their own natural and vulgar sense into a meaning more truly natural and free of all delusion and imposture. I am told that I shall be honored -- Right, for I may vindicate to myself the highest dignity. I shall be enriched. --Right, for I may roll (as they say) in riches, if I mistake not what riches are, so as to take shells, minerals, and stones for such; if I take not ought else for riches but what makes rich and satisfies; brings plenty, affluence, ease, prosperity; renders fully contented so as to desire nothing beyond, and fully secure, so as to fear no change. In short, I may have of wealth all that I can think of, all that I can bear or carry; ""if I esteem him rich only who is wise.""

Thus as to the incident fancies that come in the way and offer from abroad. Consider how to raise and excite other such, draw the out and exercise them, that so the superior part which disciplines, instructs, and manages these subjects may not loose its authority and command, may not be idle, but still at work, amending, framing, polishing, transforming, so as to give everything and edge this way, and have wherewithal to render every appearance or idea instrumental and serviceable. If I am heavy and dull, unwilling to awake and rise; consider what it is that would soon awaken and rise thee up -- ""The enemy is near and now entering."" And is that not so? What do we call an enemy? What makes an enemy dreadful? What are the consequences feared? -- Captivity, slavery, misery, -- And is that not the question here? Is not the contest concerning liberty? Is it not concerning happiness and misery?...

In the same manner, as one of those students of wit is rejoiced on account of some lucky word or expression that he has invented; as a poet is rejoiced when he has luckily versified; as a mathematician when he has made a discovery about lines and circles; as an architect when he has raised some artful pile; or a general some artful stratagem; so be thou rejoiced when, according to thine own art which thou hast learnt, it has happened to the thee skillfully, and like a master, to have modelled or well fabricated some one appearance or idea. If thou has succeeded well here, then say to thyself, ""I had rather this, than the cubilo of Michael Angelo: I had rather this than the Philippies of Demosthenes or Cicero; rather than have written like Homer, or fought like Alexander."" If thou dost not see why this is greater and more glorious than all that other, thou art so far yet from being a proficient, that thou knowest not what thy art is; what it promises, or to what it tends...

Edit: one more excerpt:

""What art thou doing here, Fancy?"" -- Mar. Aurel, Med., Bk. VII, 17 Thus must the persuader, the deceiver, the fair impostress, enchantress, be talked to; sometimes fairly, sometimes (as they say) roundly. Of if thou talkest not with her; expect that she should talk with thee, on a high tone, put thee to silence, and manage thee as she pleases.

One of these to must ever be, viz., that a man has his fancies in right discipline, turning, and commanding them; or they him. Either they must deal with him, take him up short (as they say), teach him manners, and make him know to whom he belongs; or, this will be his part, to teach the impostress Fancy and her train; show her what she is herself, and whom she has to deal with.

Some of the impressions are way off and I'm ashamed of even having them. Yesterday I was gonna have a friend to visit me and I started to have thoughts like ""oh, I should place this book here so that he will think that I'm really smart for reading this kinda stuff, and I should also wear this watch so that he'll think that I have lots of money"", absolutely ridiculous stuff!
I know that I don't have control over these impressions but I always feel guilty for having them because I never really know to what extent my actions weren't influenced by them.

Mostly I know what I should do but it's much harder to have self-control when I'm sleepy; It feels like my ego is vulnerable and I can't let it go, or like I don't have enough energy to argue with myself to do the right thing, so I allow my ego to do as it pleases.

I've been reading Cicero's [On Friendship] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laelius_de_Amicitia) a dialogue where the finer points of friendship are discussed using the relationship between Scipio Africanus and Gaius Laelius. 

In this dialogue the point was made that imagining a friend would betray you would inspire you to look for examples of betrayal in that friendship (imagined or real) thus destroying the bond of trust. This point can also be seen in the context of romantic relationships; constantly suspecting that your S.O will cheat on you may lead to a lack of trust. This of course goes against the practice of negative visualisation and provides an additional discrepancy since honest friendships are highly valued in Stoic ethics, and how can friendships be honest without trust?

So does this mean that negative visualisation is incompatible with matters of trust? Are there limitations to where negative visualistation can be applied with the correct results?

Even to be carried for any length of time is hard work, perhaps all the more so because it is an unnatural exercise; for Nature gave us legs with which to do our own walking, and eyes with which to do our own seeing. Our luxuries have condemned us to weakness; we have ceased to be able to do that which we have long declined to do. 

2 Nevertheless, I found it necessary to give my body a shaking up, in order that the bile which had gathered in my throat, if that was my trouble, might be shaken out, or, if the very breath within me had become, for some reason, too thick, that the jolting, which I have felt was a good thing for me, might make it thinner. So I insisted on being carried longer than usual, along an attractive beach, which bends between Cumae and Servilius Vatia's country-house,**[1]** shut in by the sea on one side and the lake on the other, just like a narrow path. It was packed firm under foot, because of a recent storm; since, as you know, the waves, when they beat upon the beach hard and fast, level it out; but a continuous period of fair weather loosens it, when the sand, which is kept firm by the water, loses its moisture.

3 As my habit is, I began to look about for something there that might be of service to me, when my eyes fell upon the villa which had once belonged to Vatia. So this was the place where that famous praetorian millionaire passed his old age! He was famed for nothing else than his life of leisure, and he was regarded as lucky only for that reason. For whenever men were ruined by their friendship with Asinius Gallus**[2]** whenever others were ruined by their hatred of Sejanus, and later**[3]** by their intimacy with him, – for it was no more dangerous to have offended him than to have loved him, – people used to cry out: ""O Vatia, you alone know how to live!"" 

4 But what he knew was how to hide, not how to live; and it makes a great deal of difference whether your life be one of leisure or one of idleness. So I never drove past his country-place during Vatia's lifetime without saying to myself: ""Here lies Vatia!""

But, my dear Lucilius, philosophy is a thing of holiness, something to be worshipped, so much so that the very counterfeit pleases. For the mass of mankind consider that a person is at leisure who has withdrawn from society, is free from care, self-sufficient, and lives for himself; but these privileges can be the reward only of the wise man. Does he who is a victim of anxiety know how to live for himself? What? Does he even know (and that is of first importance) how to live at all? 

5 For the man who has fled from affairs and from men, who has been banished to seclusion by the unhappiness which his own desires have brought upon him, who cannot see his neighbour more happy than himself, who through fear has taken to concealment, like a frightened and sluggish animal. – this person is not living for himself he is living for his belly, his sleep, and his lust, – and that is the most shameful thing in the world. He who lives for no one does not necessarily live for himself. Nevertheless, there is so much in steadfastness and adherence to one's purpose that even sluggishness, if stubbornly maintained, assumes an air of authority**[4]** with us.

6 I could not describe the villa accurately; for I am familiar only with the front of the house, and with the parts which are in public view and can be seen by the mere passer-by. There are two grottoes, which cost a great deal of labour, as big as the most spacious hall, made by hand. One of these does not admit the rays of the sun, while the other keeps them until the sun sets. There is also a stream running through a grove of plane-trees, which draws for its supply both on the sea and on Lake Acheron; it intersects the grove just like a race-way**[5]** and is large enough to support fish, although its waters are continually being drawn off. When the sea is calm, however, they do not use the stream, only touching the well-stocked waters when the storms give the fishermen a forced holiday. 

7 But the most convenient thing about the villa is the fact that Baiae is next door, it is free from all the inconveniences of that resort, and yet enjoys its pleasures. I myself understand these attractions, and I believe that it is a villa suited to every season of the year. It fronts the west wind, which it intercepts in such a way that Baiae is denied it. So it seems that Vatia was no fool when he selected this place as the best in which to spend his leisure when it was already unfruitful and decrepit.

8 The place where one lives, however, can contribute little towards tranquillity; it is the mind which must make everything agreeable to itself. I have seen men despondent in a gay and lovely villa, and I have seen them to all appearance full of business in the midst of a solitude. For this reason you should not refuse to believe that your life is well-placed merely because you are not now in Campania. But why are you not there? Just let your thoughts travel, even to this place. 

9 You may hold converse with your friends when they are absent, and indeed as often as you wish and for as long as you wish. For we enjoy this, the greatest of pleasures, all the more when we are absent from one another. For the presence of friends makes us fastidious; and because we can at any time talk or sit together, when once we have parted we give not a thought to those whom we have just beheld.

10 And we ought to bear the absence of friends cheerfully, just because everyone is bound to be often absent from his friends even when they are present. Include among such cases, in the first place, the nights spent apart, then the different engagements which each of two friends has, then the private studies of each and their excursions into the country, and you will see that foreign travel does not rob us of much. 

11 A friend should be retained in the spirit; such a friend can never be absent. He can see every day whomsoever he desires to see.

I would therefore have you share your studies with me, your meals, and your walks. We should be living within too narrow limits if anything were barred to our thoughts. I see you, my dear Lucilius, and at this very moment I hear you; I am with you to such an extent that I hesitate whether I should not begin to write you notes instead of letters. Farewell.

Plainly, reason itself or something else. That something else either is reason or it will be something superior to reason, which is impossible. If it is reason, who again will analyse that reason? For if it analyses itself, so can the reason with which we started. If we are going to call in something else, the process will be endless and unceasing.

'Yes,' says one, 'but the more pressing need is not logic but the discipline of men's thoughts and feelings', and the like.

If you want to hear about moral improvement, well and good. But if you say to me, 'I do not know whether you argue truly or falsely', and if I use an ambiguous word and you say to me 'distinguish', I shall grow impatient and say to you, 'this is the more pressing need.' It is for this reason, I suppose, that men put the processes of logic in the forefront, just as we put the testing of the measure before the measuring of the corn. And if we do not determine first what is the bushel and what is the scale, how shall we be able to measure or weigh anything? So in the sphere of thought if we have not fully grasped and trained to perfection the instrument by which we judge other things and understand other things, shall we ever be able to arrive at accurate knowledge? Of course, it is impossible.

'Yes,' they say, 'but the bushel is a mere thing of wood and bears no fruit.'

True, but it can measure corn.

'The processes of logic, too, are unfruitful.'

This we will consider presently: but even if one should concede this, it is enough that logic has the power to analyse and distinguish other things and in fact, as one might say, has the power to weigh and measure. Who asserts this? Is it only Chrysippus and Zeno and Cleanthes? Does not Antisthenes agree? Why, who is it that has written, 'The beginning of education is the analysis of terms'? Does not Socrates too say the same? Does not Xenophon write of him that he began with the analysis of terms, to discover what each means?

Is this then what you call great and admirable—to understand or interpret Chrysippus? Nay, no one says that. What is admirable then? To understand the will of Nature. Very well: do you understand it of yourself? If so, what more do you need? For if it is true that all error is involuntary and you have learnt the truth, you must needs do rightly hereafter.

'But,' you may say, 'I do not understand the will of Nature.'

Who then expounds it? They say 'Chrysippus.' I come and inquire what this interpreter of Nature says. I begin not to understand what he means and I seek some one to interpret. The interpreter says, 'Let us examine the sense of this phrase, as if it were Latin.'

Why, pray, should the interpreter put on airs? Even Chrysippus has no right to do so, if he is only expounding the will of Nature, and does not follow it himself: how much less his interpreter. For we have no need of Chrysippus for his own sake, but only to enable us to follow Nature: just as we have no need, for himself, of the priest who offers sacrifice, but because we think that through him we shall understand the signs which the gods give of the future, nor do we need the sacrifice for itself, but because through it the sign is given, nor do we marvel at the crow or the raven but at God who gives His signs by them.

So I come to this interpreter and priest and say, 'Examine the victim's flesh to see what sign is given me.' He takes and opens the flesh and interprets, 'Man, you have a will unhindered and unconstrained by nature. This is written here in the flesh of the sacrifice. I will show you the truth of it first in the sphere of assent. Can any one prevent you from agreeing to what is true? No one. Can any one compel you to accept the false? No one. Do you see that in this sphere your faculty is free from let and hindrance and constraint and compulsion? Is it any different in the sphere of will and impulse? What, I ask, can overcome impulse except another impulse? And what can overcome the will to get or will to avoid except another will to get or to avoid?'

'If he threatens me with death,' one says, 'he compels me.'

No, it is not what he threatens you with which compels you, but your decision that it is better to do what you are bidden than to die. Once more then it is your own judgement which compels you—that is, will puts pressure on will. For if God had so created that portion of His own being which He has taken from Himself and given to us, that it could suffer hindrance or compulsion from another, He would cease to be God and to care for us as He must needs do. 'This', says the priest, 'is what I find in the sacrifice: this is God's sign to you: if you will, you are free: if you will, you will blame no one, you will accuse no one: everything shall be in accordance with your own mind and the mind of God.'

This is the prophecy which draws me to consult this seer and philosopher, and his interpretation makes me admire not him but the truths which he interprets.

He seldom comes to see me, for no other reason than that he is afraid to hear the truth, and at present he is removed from my danger of hearing it; for one must not talk to a man unless he is willing to listen. That is why it is often doubted whether Diogenes and the other Cynics, who employed an undiscriminating freedom of speech and offered advice to any who came in their way, ought to have pursued such a plan. 2. For what if one should chide the deaf or those who are speechless from birth or by illness? But you answer: ""Why should I spare words? They cost nothing. I cannot know whether I shall help the man to whom I give advice; but I know well that I shall help someone if I advise many. I must scatter this advice by the handful.**[1]** It is impossible that one who tries often should not sometime succeed.""

3 This very thing, my dear Lucilius, is, I believe, exactly what a great-souled man ought not to do; his influence is weakened; it has too little effect upon those whom it might have set right if it had not grown so stale. The archer ought not to hit the mark only sometimes; he ought to miss it only sometimes. That which takes effect by chance is not an art. Now wisdom is an art; it should have a definite aim, choosing only those who will make progress, but withdrawing from those whom it has come to regard as hopeless, – yet not abandoning them too soon, and just when the case is becoming hopeless trying drastic remedies.

4 As to our friend Marcellinus, I have not yet lost hope. He can still be saved, but the helping hand must be offered soon. There is indeed danger that he may pull his helper down; for there is in him a native character of great vigour, though it is already inclining to wickedness. Nevertheless I shall brave this danger and be bold enough to show him his faults. 5. He will act in his usual way; he will have recourse to his wit, – the wit that can call forth smiles even from mourners. He will turn the jest, first against himself, and then against me. He will forestall every word which I am about to utter. He will quiz our philosophic systems; he will accuse philosophers of accepting doles, keeping mistresses, and indulging their appetites. He will point out to me one philosopher who has been caught in adultery, another who haunts the cafes, and another who appears at court. 6. He will bring to my notice Aristo, the philosopher of Marcus Lepidus, who used to hold discussions in his carriage; for that was the time which he had taken for editing his researches, so that Scaurus said of him when asked to what school he belonged: ""At any rate, he isn't one of the Walking Philosophers."" Julius Graecinus, too, a man of distinction, when asked for an opinion on the same point, replied: ""I cannot tell you; for I don't know what he does when dismounted,"" as if the query referred to a chariot-gladiator.**[2]** 7. It is mountebanks of that sort, for whom it would be more creditable to have left philosophy alone than to traffic in her, whom Marcellinus will throw in my teeth. But I have decided to put up with taunts; he may stir my laughter, but I perchance shall stir him to tears; or, if he persist in his jokes, I shall rejoice, so to speak, in the midst of sorrow, because he is blessed with such a merry sort of lunacy. But that kind of merriment does not last long. Observe such men, and you will note that within a short space of time they laugh to excess and rage to excess. 8. It is my plan to approach him and to show him how much greater was his worth when many thought it less. Even though I shall not root out his faults, I shall put a check upon them; they will not cease, but they will stop for a time; and perhaps they will even cease, if they get the habit of stopping. This is a thing not to be despised, since to men who are seriously stricken the blessing of relief is a substitute for health. 9. So while I prepare myself to deal with Marcellinus, do you in the meantime, who are able, and who understand whence and whither you have made your way, and who for that reason have an inkling of the distance yet to go, regulate your character, rouse your courage, and stand firm in the face of things which have terrified you. Do not count the number of those who inspire fear in you. Would you not regard as foolish one who was afraid of a multitude in a place where only one at a time could pass? Just so, there are not many who have access to you to slay you, though there are many who threaten you with death. Nature has so ordered it that, as only one has given you life, so only one will take it away.

10 If you had any shame, you would have let me off from paying the last instalment. Still, I shall not be niggardly either, but shall discharge my debts to the last penny and force upon you what I still owe: ""I have never wished to cater to the crowd; for what I know, they do not approve, and what they approve, I do not know.""**[3]** 11. ""Who said this?"" you ask, as if you were ignorant whom I am pressing into service; it is Epicurus. But this same watchword rings in your ears from every sect, – Peripatetic, Academic, Stoic, Cynic. For who that is pleased by virtue can please the crowd? It takes trickery to win popular approval; and you must needs make yourself like unto them; they will withhold their approval if they do not recognise you as one of themselves. However, what you think of yourself is much more to the point than what others think of you. The favour of ignoble men can be won only by ignoble means. 12. What benefit, then, will that vaunted philosophy confer, whose praises we sing, and which, we are told, is to be preferred to every art and every possession? Assuredly, it will make you prefer to please yourself rather than the populace, it will make you weigh, and not merely count, men's judgments, it will make you live without fear of gods or men, it will make you either overcome evils or end them. Otherwise, if I see you applauded by popular acclamation, if your entrance upon the scene is greeted by a roar of cheering and clapping, marks of distinction meet only for actors, – if the whole state, even the women and children, sing your praises, how can I help pitying you? For I know what pathway leads to such popularity. Farewell.

He is a man of ability; his very first words showed what spirit and understanding he possesses, and what progress he has already made. He gave me a foretaste, and he will not fail to answer thereto. For he spoke not from forethought, but was suddenly caught off his guard. When he tried to collect himself, he could scarcely banish that hue of modesty, which is a good sign in a young man; the blush that spread over his face seemed so to rise from the depths. And I feel sure that his habit of blushing will stay with him after he has strengthened his character, stripped off all his faults, and become wise. For by no wisdom can natural weaknesses of the body be removed. That which is implanted and inborn can be toned down by training, but not overcome. 2 The steadiest speaker, when before the public, often breaks into a perspiration, as if he had wearied or over-heated himself; some tremble in the knees when they rise to speak; I know of some whose teeth chatter, whose tongues falter, whose lips quiver. Training and experience can never shake off this habit; nature exerts her own power and through such a weakness makes her presence known even to the strongest. 3 I know that the blush, too, is a habit of this sort, spreading suddenly over the faces of the most dignified men. It is, indeed more prevalent in youth, because of the warmer blood and the sensitive countenance; nevertheless, both seasoned men and aged men are affected by it. Some are most dangerous when they redden, as if they were letting all their sense of shame escape. 4 Sulla, when the blood mantled his cheeks, was in his fiercest mood. Pompey had the most sensitive cast of countenance; he always blushed in the presence of a gathering, and especially at a public assembly. Fabianus also, I remember, reddened when he appeared as a witness before the senate; and his embarrassment became him to a remarkable degree. 5 Such a habit is not due to mental weakness, but to the novelty of a situation; an inexperienced person is not necessarily confused, but is usually affected, because he slips into this habit by natural tendency of the body. Just as certain men are full-blooded, so others are of a quick and mobile blood, that rushes to the face at once.

6 As I remarked, Wisdom can never remove this habit; for if she could rub out all our faults, she would be mistress of the universe. Whatever is assigned to us by the terms of our birth and the blend in our constitutions, will stick with us, no matter how hard or how long the soul may have tried to master itself. And we cannot forbid these feelings any more than we can summon them. 7 Actors in the theatre, who imitate the emotions, who portray fear and nervousness, who depict sorrow, imitate bashfulness by hanging their heads, lowering their voices, and keeping their eyes fixed and rooted upon the ground. They cannot, however, muster a blush; for the blush cannot be prevented or acquired. Wisdom will not assure us of a remedy, or give us help against it; it comes or goes unbidden, and is a law unto itself.

8 But my letter calls for its closing sentence. Hear and take to heart this useful and wholesome motto:**[1]** ""Cherish some man of high character, and keep him ever before your eyes, living as if he were watching you, and ordering all your actions as if he beheld them."" 9 Such, my dear Lucilius, is the counsel of Epicurus;**[2]** he has quite properly given us a guardian and an attendant. We can get rid of most sins, if we have a witness who stands near us when we are likely to go wrong. The soul should have someone whom it can respect, - one by whose authority it may make even its inner shrine more hallowed.**[3]** Happy is the man who can make others better, not merely when he is in their company, but even when he is in their thoughts! And happy also is he who can so revere a man as to calm and regulate himself by calling him to mind! One who can so revere another, will soon be himself worthy of reverence. 10 Choose therefore a Cato; or, if Cato seems too severe a model, choose some Laelius, a gentler spirit. Choose a master whose life, conversation, and soul-expressing face have satisfied you; picture him always to yourself as your protector or your pattern. For we must indeed have someone according to whom we may regulate our characters; you can never straighten that which is crooked unless you use a ruler. Farewell.

This, of course, is the sense in which the ancient Stoics were philosophers.

Nowadays, the word ""philosopher"" evokes a rather different set of connotations and associations: an abstract thinker whose system of thought typically has no direct or overriding influence on his or her way of behaving and living.

It is in some ways deceptive, then, to think reflexively of those ancients as ""philosophers,"" as the shades of meaning evoked by that term will tend, consciously or unconsciously, towards the modern sense of the word. By the same token, it is needlessly distracting to continually make the conscious effort required to mentally remind oneself each time that these ancients were ""philosophers"" in a different sense of the word. This unfortunate artifact of language obscures something basic and essential about both the ancient and the modern practice of Stoicism (and other endeavors that are ""philosophical"" in the ancient sense) that ought to be evoked, not hidden, by the words we use.

The word ""philosopher"" is derived from the Greek roots ""philo"" (loving) and ""sophia"" (wisdom)-- literally, a ""lover of wisdom.""

Can we coin an alternative word that captures something of the original sense of the word ""philosophy"" by a similar admixture of Greek roots into a new English word?

I have in mind something to the effect of: ""one who harmonizes one's life with one's principles."" (This is seemingly close to the Stoic maxim of ""living according to nature,"" though it might be nice to use a formulation that could apply more generally, e.g. equally as well to an Epicurean, Pyhrronist, etc.)

That formulation would revolve around three roots:

* harmony / accordance / agreement / consistency / conformity / unity

* life (bios) / soul (psyche) / deeds / actions / conduct / character

* principles (logos?) / reason / words / doctrine / worldview / inquiry / examination

I imagine there are probably many ways to combine variations of the above three semantic elements into one word using Greek. Some criteria for selection might include auditory / visual aesthetics, ease of pronunciation, brevity, and sufficient distinctness from already existing words with different meanings. Unfortunately, I am not a linguist and know no Greek, so I can't carry this idea any further. Would be interested to see if anyone else is interested and could offer up some proposals, or related ideas.

Here's my two cent's worth.

Sir Henry Maine writes: ""just as the oldest Greek theorists supposed that the sports of chance had changed the material universe from its simple primitive form into its present heterogeneous condition, so their intellectual descendants imagined that but for untoward accident the human race would have conformed itself to simpler rules of conduct and a less tempestuous life. To live according to nature came to be considered as the end for which man was created, and which the best men were bound to compass. To live according to nature was to rise above the disorderly habits and gross indulgences of the vulgar to higher laws of action which nothing but self-denial and self-command would enable the aspirant to observe. It is notorious that this proposition—live according to nature—was the sum of the tenets of the famous Stoic philosophy. Now on the subjugation of Greece that philosophy [i.e., the Stoic] made instantaneous progress in Roman society. It possessed natural fascinations for the powerful class who, in theory at least, adhered to the simple habits of the ancient Italian race, and disdained to surrender themselves to the innovations of foreign fashions. Such persons began immediately to affect the Stoic precepts of life according to nature . . ."" [Ancient Law.]

So, from one simplistic understanding of existence to another, and another, and another—and people still believe in progress!!! Real progress will begin when men stop warring against one another—whose wars, after all? And no, I didn't vote for any party or any government—they're all the same—and there is no democracy. Look for instance at America and Britain today: you call what goes on in these two tyrannies democracy? I don't.

Yes, and when men stop resorting to ""the"" so-called ""law""—whose laws? I didn't write them; played no part. I don't impose laws on others and then brutally enforce them. No, these Laws were written by the ruling classes, the oppressors; in fact, in a just society, my equals who therefore have no right whatsoever to rule over me.
 
But so long as this ""powerful class"" of oppressors, oligarchs, optimates / conservatives—the class of the few, the class of the greedy profiteers and the well-propertied, the class of the bankers, the big corporations, and their government cronies and lackeys, so long as these tyrants dominate and subjugate the masses with their police forces, their military powers, their State media propaganda, their churches, . . . their . . . rant, rant, rant, etc., etc.. 

As Sir Henry Maine points out, and it is something that cannot be denied, Stoicism ""possessed natural fascinations for the powerful class"", etc., etc.. 

Note well: ""the powerful class"".
 
And to live according to nature ""was to rise above the disorderly habits and gross indulgences of the vulgar to higher laws of action""; in other words, living according to nature could only be done by the powerful class: they alone are capable of ""higher laws of action"".
 
And the ""vulgar"", ie., the lowly common people, the plebs, the slaves, etc., they are excluded entry to this very exclusive club.
 
""Living according to nature"" thus amounts to a load of mystical pseudo-esoteric codswallop; it may sound good and appear stylish but it is in truth an essentially meaningless phrase lacking substance.
