1374251721.0,1110,self.unitedkingdom,1in1pl,Howdy UK. Referred from /r/WorldNews A Texan (accustomed to Heat Waves) has some tips for you..,MadManuel,1476,366,1194,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1in1pl/howdy_uk_referred_from_rworldnews_a_texan/,"Some of these tips may come across as fairly Red-Neck.. mostly because they are.. The rest are common sense. 

Today in Austin, Texas, it is 28C.. This is actually pretty cool for us. We're accustomed to 37C to 40C during the hottest summer months. (June through around September) 

1. Box Fans. &amp; Swamp Coolers
You can normally find these in hardware stores, or big box appliance retailers.. I realize that due to the heat wave, everyone and their cousin is probably stocking up on these things right now. They're usually around $10 here, I'm going to guess they're around 20£. 

Big blocks of ice are typically hard to come by, but what I like to do around the house, is get a cooler, or in worst case scenario, a bucket. Fill the cooler or bucket up with ice, and then set the box fan up, such that it is blowing air across the ice. This is basically a swamp cooler.. It's not as good as A/C but it will cut the heat enough that you can function. 

Bonus technique..: The worst part about a heat wave is trying to sleep through it at night. This is a slightly crazier technique but if it's so hot out you've ditched you're sheets, and you're staring at the ceiling praying for death.. It might be the option you've been looking for.. 

Set up your wall o' box fans (2-3, or how ever many box fans you have), such that they are at the height of the mattress you're going to be sleeping on.. you want to position the fans so it's going to blow air directly over you.. Then, instead of ice (which is often hard to get in the middle of the night) you take your top sheets off the bed, and haul them into the bath tub, and soak them. Then wring out the sheet so that it is damp, but not so that it is dripping. then throw it back on the bed like you normally would.. 
- It feels a little wierd at first to be trying to get under a wet sheet, but if you get as hot as I do, you'll drift off to sleep in about 5 minutes.. You may have to re-soak the sheet every 4 hours or so.. but at least that's 4 hours of sleep you didn't have before..

2. Water. 
Sort of an extension of the above.. Cold Showers, Cold compresses, bandanas; Cool all the parts of the body that traditionally radiate heat. Hands, Feet, neck, head.. Cool water baths for your hands &amp; feet.. For your neck or head, I like taking a 20oz water bottle, and freezing it solid. Then I wrap a towel around it and put it behind my neck. For my head, I'll get a towel and soak it in water.. wring it out so it's still damp (but not dripping) and wrap it around my head. Especially good for sleeping.

3. Altitude.. 
I'm not sure what your living situation is, but basically the lower in your house you can get the better. If your bedroom is on the 2nd floor, relocate to the 1st floor or basement for the duration of the heat wave. Hot Air Rises.. 

4. Hydration.
Drink water til you pee clear. Maintain that level. Add some electrolytes because invariably you're sweating some out. 
Avoid Caffeine (ya'll have decaffeinated tea right?, and alcohol as both these things can lead to further dehydration) You might take a momentary step in to Brit-heresy, and consider Iced Tea instead of hot.. (please don't burn me at the stake for suggesting this..)

5. Public Places..
If there's a library, or movie theater or similar large commercial location, they probably have massive HVAC systems. Use them. 
Even if only for 30min to get out of the heat.. World of difference.

6. Food
Smaller meals, with more veggies. Basically anything with a huge amount of meat protein, or carbs is going to cause your body to generate more heat as it breaks down those food types. Skip the steak, have a salad.. 

7. First Aid.. 
You're going to see heat related health issues.. Either at home or at the office, or even in the street. Heat Stroke, Heat Exhaustion, and Dehydration. All can be potentially lethal. I've seen one guy literally go batshit nuts from dehydration.. Ranting and screaming..
I won't list all the symptoms here, but hop on over to WebMD, and look up the symptoms. 

8. Wet-T-Shirts..
Classic cotton T-shirts.. Soak em' just like the sheets. 
Cools your core tempature right down. 

9. RedNeck Heat Shields..
Get yourself a roll of tin foil, or aluminium however it is ya'll pronounce it. Using cardboard as a backing, wrap the foil around the front of the card board sheets and block out your windows. The foil reflects the heat of the sun, and the cardboard provides a little positive insulation against the  heat.. Sure this turns your house into something akin to a fall out shelter or cave, but at least you're cooler inside...

10. Creepy cat lady shades..
Open your windows, but lower your blinds.. You get some air flow, but the bulk of the light &amp; heat stays outside.

11. Breeze Ways.. 
You may have to experiment on which doors and windows to leave open, but if you've ever had a window open, and the front door open at the same time.. and go to shut the door, only to have air pressure slam the door for you.. You know what I'm talking about.. 
You want to create a path through your home that encourages air flow.. This is only going to help some of you..

12. Siesta.. 
Texas, especially south texas is deeply rooted in hispanic culture. One of the best traditions we embrace is the Siesta. (admittedly it's harder and harder to do during the working days in the US, I still sneak out during the mid-day hours for a nap when I can get away with it.) Basically it's a well timed nap. Escape the heat of the day by lazing around the house for an hour or two during the 12-2pm hours.. The hottest times of the day. 

I hope this listing helps..

Maybe we can get the Reddit Gift Exchange guys mobilized to ship UK Redditors box fans or something..

Edit: Reddit formatting screwed up my numbering.. Oh well.. you're worth two #1's. 




EDIT:
Pet/Child Warning: UPDATE FROM: /u/WishIWereHere
**DO NOT LEAVE CHILDREN OR PETS IN TURNED OFF CARS.** They will die. I'm not even joking. I know you guys don't depend on cars as much as we do here so this may not apply to you, but still, the temperature inside a car sitting in the sun can get really hot.

The study found that even at 9 a.m. with an outside temperature of 28 degrees, the closed automobile registered 43 degrees inside. When the outside temperature rose to 44 degrees at 1:30 p.m., the closed vehicle reached 51 degrees. 

Even just a few minutes isn't ok. If you see a child or an animal inside a locked unattended car, seriously consider calling the police, because no joke, they can die.

EDIT:
Heat Stroke/Heat Exhaustion first Aid tips from:/u/Synthetic_Sound
Hi there - fellow Austin-ite here. I just wanted to add that one of the more common, and sometimes overlooked symptoms of heat exhaustion/stroke is the ""train"" feeling - you begin to hear a ""roaring"" in your ears, and will feel quite dizzy all of a sudden. If this happens - take it seriously. Find shade and drink water immediately. Oh, also, this is going to sound strange, but don't drink ice water. Try drinking it at room temperature, or just below. It will cool you down faster, and won't send your body into shock (so to speak). This is especially important if you're feeling the effects of heat exhaustion or stroke. Plus, if you're super dehydrated and you drink something really cold, you're pretty much guaranteeing yourself a massive headache if you drink it too fast.

If you're feeling extra hot, take a cotton ball, dab it in rubbing alcohol, and run it across the back of your neck. I have no idea how or why this works - but it's a pretty quick method of cooling yourself down at least temporarily.

If y'all have any other questions or such, I'll be around for awhile! Best of luck everyone :)

Only one of the players can buy the stations and another can buy the utilities. This is decided after the start of the game by a tendering process where you have to bid on the ability to buy them.

If you win the tender and buy a station or utility, the other players have to pay £10 to the bank whenever they pass ""GO"" as a subsidy for running them that goes to the player that owns them.

Chance cards now all cost you money (Bank error in their favour. Pay £300 or you'll be evicted).

Community Chest cards are only given out if you pass a physical and questionnaire from ATOS.

The only way to Get Out Of Jail is to appeal to the Supreme Court or ECHR and pay legal costs.

""Go Directly To Jail"" is to be replaced by ""Go To Embassy For Asylum"". You are then no longer allowed to participate in the game.

The bank will go bust at a random point during the game and will need to be bailed out by all players paying £500 into the bank. This will be when the first player throws a double 6.

The player acting as the banker is allowed to pay themselves a £500 bonus every time they pass """"GO"", on top of their £200.

If nobody speaks about it until the nine months is just about up that could make a noticeable protest. That includes complaining about the media coverage. Just boycott all publicity for it.

**Edit** Okay, I'm not protesting the monarchy here and I'm not taking an anti-royalist platform. Nobody is saying you can't follow the news on the pregnancy either as this isn't about censorship. It's just what I'm proposing is based upon media-saturation of the topic whereby it's pushed in our faces. We don't want to see a rolling live-feed of scan pictures and maternity dresses, much to the detriment of other news (such as important global events like the potential revolution in Syria under-way).

As mentioned in the comments below, the two major newsworthy events on this subject would be:

1. Genuinely unusual or unexpected event.
2. Announcement of the birth.

If anything I think William and Kate might welcome something like this in the media itself, (not that it would happen) as I'm sure they're not happy with the prospect of throngs of reporters camped out like it's payday come early.

We also have this image mocked up now thanks to philthehumanist in the comments below: http://i.imgur.com/BGnEL.jpg?1

**Edit 2** I don't mean to be standoffish, but if cowardly passive-aggressive downvoting of all my comments is all you have to offer then just don't bother. I guess we'll just have to ignore whoever's doing that though. This was mainly just to provide discourse.

The EDL has about a hundred thousand followers on facebook 

Out of the 60 million people in this country. 

And no way to measure who's just there to troll the EDL. 

Yet according to the bulk of opinion at r/worldnews - judging by upvotes - these people, the few crazy Islamists and the few crazy racists, supposedly represent our nation?! 

Is r/worldnews being specifically targeted by racist voting brigades? 
Or are so many people really getting their only news/views about the UK from the likes of the Daily Express and Fox news?

I don't want to get derailed in to a wide ranging discussion about terrorism, religion etc. There are plenty  of existent threads for that. 

I'm just asking the very general question ... Do you feel the way the UK is presented on r/worldnews and in foreign media is at all accurate or reflective of your own experience? Because I really, really, really don't. 

I feel like I'm being told to be afraid of my friends and neighbours by people who I suspect would struggle to find my country on an Atlas.

If you feel strongly that unpaid internships are unfair and the law should be more strictly enforced to combat them, please get involved with intern rights groups such as Intern Aware. As long as people care about changing things rather than accepting 'that's just the way it is' even when 'it' is wrong, there's hope of doing something positive - as you all know, and I'm sorry I even just wrote that.

Examples of this are rife in America but lobbyist backed action in the UK are only slowly coming into the UK agenda for instance this http://alturl.com/4mjqx which lobbyists claim to wield a large amount of power over parliament.

Now the MP Claire Perry and a The national paper The Daily Mail who are notorious for being little shits generally. Have decided to put censorship of internet pornography on there main agendas.

Why they have decided to do so is unclear. The Daily Mail has assumed a stance of moral panic and Claire Perry has said that ""Perry said that she has been accused of censorship over the campaign, but argued that the internet was no different to TV and radio and should be regulated accordingly.""

Ladies and gentleman the internet is not the TV. or the Radio and should not be compared to either. Such regulations would be damaging to the very things that make the internet what it is today. Please Email Claire Perry claire.perry.mp@parliament.uk feel free to give her a ring 020 7219 7050 (if you are in london then it will be remarkably cheap to do) Also might I note that I am not claiming that Claire Perry has been paid by lobbyists or even manipulated by them she may well have decided to take up the cause of default internet censorship under her own steam. Although it's a little unlikely isn't it?

I know for many of you that you may be students and have exams coming up. Even if that is the case feel free to link this thread and ask your local MP to please explain to you the plans. reference articles

Is the lack of diversity in sources a bad thing, an issue to be considered, or is it a reflection of a lack of diversity in available news sources?

Would it be better for submitters who see an interesting story on the BBC/Guardian to spend a few moments trying to find an alternative news source, simply to create a diversity of sources, or are we happy with the majority of news coming from a small coterie of writers?

I am not overly condemning the current situation, it was just something that really stood out this morning.

That said, I personally would prefer a more diverse range of websites, and do generally try to avoid submitting *yet another* link to the BBC, although naturally, that is not always possible.

",roamingandy,604,124,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/wxssj/would_anyone_else_like_to_see_the_house_of_lords/,"i feel this would be a much better balance to the house of commons, having actual experts of each field discussing and representing how each new law and bill would effect areas in which they are extremely knowledgable. creating a political system which is more progressive and less resistant to change than we have now.

anyone else agree? perhaps if we get enough people we could start a petition and write to a few media outlets to try and start some debate on the topic? right now is the time while its being reformed and discussed. 

if we suggested it to a couple of science magazines for example i'm sure some would be interested in printing an article about the idea.

edit: my main intention is not to design the perfect sytem but to get discussion on the topic started, that said i'll expand my initial post as the idea has developed through the discussions below (which i've enjoyed a lot).

- it wouldnt be unions representing teachers, retailers, transport workers. the house would be made from specialists in the academic theory of the field like, experts in education sciences, medical sciences and experts in the theory of trade and social sciences.
- the idea is not to replace politics with experts but to have a house made up from peer elected specialists balancing the house of commons to ensure that their advice and opinions cannot be ignored by policians.
- probably yearly elections, elected by peers. perhaps all those with a masters in a related subject (as they will be the ones who actually follow the works of the top people in their field).
- i'm not really sure how seating would be allocated fairly.. maybe the public could vote on this. it would be good to interest the public in which fields are most beneficial to their society.
- i dont think this is the best political change we could hope for, i just think its entirely unrealistic to expect the current system to organise any larger a change - whereas changing the house of lords is something that is being debated now, and public dissatifaction with government is pretty damn high due to the economy and the banking issues. this is a step forwards that i could see having a chance to catching on if we could bring attention to it.
- also any form of campaigning could be made illegal. the idea being to get people chosen on merit, not to let them tell eveyone else why they deserve to be chosen.

as the experts of a field are generally focused on the cutting edge developments in each area, bringing in a more progressively minded elected house is something that could lead to larger future changes as sociologists, political scientists (rather than politicans) and computer science experts discuss how their area's latest developments could improve our current govenance system.

I understand you were using a throwaway, so I'm hoping you browse /r/UK with your main account. 

I enjoyed it for several reasons. The first, is that it's always amusing to see (mainly) Americans saying ""Wait... You British actually say things like shag?"" and ""What's Hollyoaks?"".

The second, is that I think it gave a valuable insight to how council accomodation works, who it's given to, what happens and so on. Really interesting read, even from someone who lives in the UK and used to live on a council estate.

Because of that, little real investigative work has gone into finding the truth about what Snowden discovered, but instead, has gone into a smear campaign for whistleblowers like him. This is pretty indicative of where the US mass media has gone, which is kinda sad. 

Thankfully, someone's bothering to report the news, the BBC and the Guardian. It's really helped my opinion of news media in general that someone's actually following real news stories instead of the skewed views of the US gov't. And I'm not the only one. My family usually turns on CNN or one of our local news networks when we want to know what's going on, but more and more, they've wrangled me into hooking up my laptop to the TV so we can see BBC news reports.

Nothing fancy, working in a warehouse for ASDA.  But the thought of money in my pocket, 8 miles of cycling (each way) and being able to pay the bills = brilliant.  So long belly!

What I want to make sure is that Ingeus get absolutely no credit at all for this.  I'm on the work program but they have done absolutely nothing, not a single thing to help me.  While the member of staff I spoke too is nice, they deserve zero credit for me getting this job.

Is there anyway I can make sure that doesn't happen?

For those still unemployed.  Keep at it and keep your chin up.

Edit:  Got a lot more comments than I expected!  Thank you all for your kind words.

I've asked if there's chance of more hours (He's going to ring me back to see if he can get more more shifts).  I guess this is the benefit trap people talk about.

This isn't meant as an anti-U.S rant in the slightest- I currently live out here, and I can say for certain that there is enough about Britishness to keep any half-intelligent American interested in discussion without resorting to depressingly limited caricature. But there's a kind of sad inferiority complex at work, where Brits profess how great our nation is, but can only have that validated by our larger cousins, so we resort to dull generalisations that will please them.

edit:

Happy to see that the majority agree with me. I think that cecinestpasunepony gave the best reasoning that I've read in the thread, but it was hidden by its parent being down voted:

Also, many Americans mention Brits using the word 'cunt' willy nilly, but this really isn't as widespread as people seem to think it is. Nobody I know uses it as it's thought misogynistic and really crass. I'm not a snob and I'm far from posh, but in my opinion decent people just don't talk like that.

Me too.",TheMentalist10,461,75,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1it20c/help_starting_a_british_proprivacy_antiprism_and/,"Hello, Guys,

I'm looking to create (or get involved in, as I've no real experience or interest in moderating Subs) a UK movement similar to the US /r/RestoreTheFourth.

In an initial fit of passion, I started /r/RestoreTheFourthUK (which, I realise, was a terrible name. However, I didn't/don't feel that I, or anyone else, should alone come up with the movement's name), which has done less-than-*okay*. It's largely the name, as the community, though small, is pretty dedicated to the cause, as I'm sure most of us would be with a proper outlet.

So what do you think it should be called? How do we start? The name is a massive barrier to entry as it's notoriously difficult to get people subscribing and resubscribing to a string of different subs and Reddit tends to be quite superficial about Sub-names alone. It would be great to hear your ideas!

Thanks, **currently [discussing on IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/?settings=dd892af474749b032ba39bb88a8894d9) on #Reinst8 if anyone fancies a chat!**

**EDIT: I'm told to point out that we're on SNOONET for those using an IRC client**

P.S. I'm trying hard to overcome the fact that Reddit makes everything we all say look a lot like oneupmanship, criticism etc. If you have any interest in the goals of a movement such as /r/RestoreTheFourth, please bring your ideas and motivation so that we can move forwards as one! There's no sub-text or wish to somehow 'get one over' on everyone. I'm just keen to get this moving!

**EDIT: After a long IRC discussion, and having scoured previous threads with name suggestions, we'd like to put the vote to you guys.**

**[HERE'S THE LINK TO THE NAME VOTE!](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DT83XLV)**

**Another Edit:** [**The Survey**](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DT83XLV) has, thus far, had ~~55~~ 75(!) responses! ~~It's set to shut at 23:45 as we need to get the whole name thing out of the way~~As it's a free account, it'll stop at 100 submissions, and unless something bizarre happens (such as everyone voting for their own idea), then we should be good to proceed in our own Sub following that. I'll keep you in the loop, and keep voting. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: there's nothing quite like filtering through vote replies of a Summer's eve.
  
**Final Update (I think):**

To keep it as fair as possible, the voting consisted of three rounds (all within the same vote), weighted according to the order of the choice (i.e. 1st choice is weighted more heavily than 3rd, naturally). I also included an option for people to 'spoil' their vote by submitting their own thing, which only a handful of users opted to do. Had lots of people elected to do this, we would've had to open it up again entirely to new suggestions, so I'm glad it didn't happen. Anyway, the results are counted and verified, and here you go:


**Name**| **Weighted Results**
:--|:--
Stop Watching Us| 33 
Privacy UK | 70 (2nd Place)
End 1984 | 17
No More 1984 | 65 (3rd Place)
The Freedom Foundation | 41

Fight For Freedom | 11
Protest Against PRISM | 8
Freedom is Fundamental | 31
United Against Digital Dictatorship | 47
Freedoms UK | 33
Stop Spying On Us | 23
***

For that reason, **all activity for this movement will now take place in the about-to-be-made-unprivate /r/ReinstateArticle8**. I hope you'll join us and thank you for all your brilliant efforts so far. I know not all of us will like the name, but the important thing is that it was settled fairly and that we have one. It's catchy enough to work with the media, and makes enough sense to support the movement and, as such, will more than suit our needs. 

We'd love to hear from you (particularly if you've got some useful skillset such as web-design, CSS, Sub-Reddit modding, Press experience etc.), so please do get in touch and help us all out.

Many thanks.",,False,,t5_2qhqb,1374533020.0,,,True,t3_1it20c,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1it20c/help_starting_a_british_proprivacy_antiprism_and/,

1343509991.0,355,self.unitedkingdom,xba8l,Complaining to NBC,suntzusartofarse,425,70,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/xba8l/complaining_to_nbc/,"I found this e-mail address to contact NBC about the Olympic Opening Ceremony 7/7 gaffe:

nbcolympicsfeedback@nbcuni.com

(from [this page on the NBC site](http://www.nbc.com/contact/general/))

Since the 'net is global, I see no reason why we shouldn't send our complaints individually, rather than waiting for other media organisations/politicians to ask for an apology on our behalf.

I won't post exactly what I sent, since copypasta is easily dismissed, _but_ it will be harder for them to ignore us if we keep our message and demands coherent. So, with that in mind, here's a list of the main points (from my own e-mail) that you might like to use:

 * That you're contacting them specifically about the replacement of the 7/7 tribute during the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony. No need to mention any of the other problems with the broadcast, IMO; it just makes it harder for them to understand what we're complaining about and therefore easier to dismiss.

 * You're shocked/saddened/appalled/whatever you're feeling that NBC appear to think the deaths of 52 ~~British~~ civilians on 7/7, the day after London was announced as the Olmypic venue for 2012, was less important than a fluff interview with Michael Phelps.

 * Source [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-nbc-opening-ceremony) (or similar) to show you're not just some crackpot, whingeing about nothing, but that British media are reporting the insult to the victims.

 * That if it were the BBC that removed footage of an American tribute to the victims of 9/11, Americans would--rightly--be very upset.

 * **Most Importantly** you believe NBC owes the British people two things:

 1. immediate, unreserved public apology for replacing the 7/7 tribute;

 1. honest commitment to review how decisions like the removal of the 7/7 tribute are made, to avoid mistakes like this in future;

By all accounts, NBC's coverage was pretty terrible throughout and it's pretty tempting to complain to them about that too, but if we keep a laser focus on the 7/7 gaffe, with _specific, quantitative demands_ they should at least apologise, and _maybe_ we'll influence NBC's coverage of future events for the better.

Spread this to as many people as you can! I believe we should get a proper complain-fest going over this. I'm honestly disgusted at NBC's lack of sensitivity.

She claimed that the British in their thinking are more similiar to the American, especially with their edge on liberty (I think she was more talking about economical liberty) and cultural indepency and that their shared Anglo-Saxon heritage made the UK more similiar to the USA as, for example, Germany or France.

Now, please don't downvote more, I am curious, would agree with this statement? How is America perceived in the UK? I know the UK was the only European country that went into the Iraq and that economocial policies in the UK are more ""American flavoured"" than they are in other European countries. As a proud British man or woman would you identify yourself more with the American culture than continental one?

For starters I'm a sikh, not practising but its the faith I was bought up in and I'm feeling like I'm a prisoner in my own home lately, the fact that I'm getting stared at by a whole heap of people just while shopping with my wife, or whatever and then being taunted by teenagers walking back home or to work just isn't right, there's a lot of ignorance and generalising and I would wish that people would just educate themselves more and not be completely comparable to a sheep following its flock running off a cliff when it comes to media. I don't feel safe in my own fucking home in what you could call a decent area and completely helpless when i have to head to work.

My friends on my facebook have also been making the most unreasonable posts I have ever seen in my life, some of which I've had to delete completely.

Its perfectly fine to make big deals about certain events and completely ignore the others it seems, ofcourse this has never changed over many many years but as humans and what we should call an intelligent species we should all be making Great Britain, well, Great, not the complete opposite. 

There's always going to be bad apples in every given society but to keep on generalising a whole race, immigrants, or whatever you want to call it is just going to make matters worse, retaliation after retaliation, and yes I also get there's never going to be any peace because we all have to just accept the fact that there are dickheads and people who have some sense in their heads, especially when it comes to things like this, but sometimes I, like a lot of you need and want to get things off my chest,  I never usually post anything like this because I tend to be more of a pacifist and wait things out but it has driven me crazy to the point where I can't sleep at night.

On Sunday, May 1, 2011, my partner was sexually assaulted outside The Eldon Pub on Woodhouse Lane in Leeds. The prominent blond haired man featured in the above video is wanted in relation to this crime. He was white, aged 25 to 40, about 5ft 7ins tall and stocky, with short blond hair and a round face. He was with a group of men who hinted that they had travelled from Durham and spoke with a Northern (possible Geordie) accent.

If anyone recognises this man or can provide any help whatsoever in tracing him, please PM us with details. Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers (anonymously) on 0800 555 111.

Just in case there is any doubt of authenticity, [here is a related newspaper article](http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/woman_sexually_assaulted_outside_leeds_pub_1_3342715). I am a long-time Redditor (5 years and counting!), but I hope you appreciate my partner's request to retain my anonymity. We would also both massively appreciate you forwarding the video to anyone you know.
Thank you so much (from both of us) for any help that you can possible provide.

UPDATE:
My girlfriend and I have just logged on, expecting at most to see a few helpful comments. We were however genuinely astounded to find *so* much help and kindness shown from *so* many people. She's promised never again to mock me for the amount of time I spend on Reddit :)
I'm a little concerned that it may cause issues further down the line if I was to further discuss the fine details of this case online, and with having no experience whatsoever in this area (thankfully), I'd like to err on the side of caution for now. I therefore hope you understand that I cannot answer all of your questions at the moment, but **as soon** as this is resolved, I will of course post a full update.

Two glaring examples to me are the news story about the [judge who said 'burglary takes courage'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-19503922) and the recent debacle about the [schoolgirl who disappeared with her teacher](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19698726).

The first had ""Judge says burglary takes courage"" as the headline in the sidebar. That and the fact that they have a highly shifty photo of the burglar in question (which in my opinion is completely superfluous) just adds insult to injury.

The second originally had a much more sinister looking picture of Jeremy Forrest where he is scowling and has facial , the teacher before it was known that they most likely absconded together. I really wish that I had taken a screenshot because I almost knew that it was going to turn out differently.

In France, it is actually against the law to print pictures of someone in handcuffs before they are convicted because it conveys guilt to the reader. I really don't see how either of these examples are any different.

Regardless of my opinion of events in the two articles, I feel it is a journalist's duty to recount events in the most neutral way possible. BBC News is supposed to have world class journalistic integrity (in stark contrast to something like the daily fail) and yet I'm continuing to notice more and more problems such as the ones epitomised by the two examples above. Is anyone else?

**[Tax](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/2993-ukip-proposed-tax-policy)**

*""18 pence in the pound goes on servicing government debt.""* - this is totally untrue - expenditure is 3% of GDP or 6% of public sector spending. Sources [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt) and [here](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/6848/economics/cost-of-servicing-debt/)

*""The coalition boasts it has cut the annual deficit by 25%,  yet any school boy with a calculator can work out to reduce national debt the reduction needs to be 125% otherwise it continues to grow.""* - this is confusing and hilarious. A 100% reduction would balance the books, and lead to no debt in the long run. Significantly less than a 100% reduction in deficit would still see a reduction in debt (so long as it was lower than the historic deficit average).

*""Historically, time and again, it has been proven that reduction in tax rates boosts the economy and paradoxically does not reduce the tax take.""* - that's an improbable theory at best, see [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/study-tax-cuts-dont-lead-to-growth-2012-9), [or here](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/10/does-taxing-the-wealthy-hurt-growth.html), [or indeed here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/03/15/capital-gains-tax-rates-and-economic-growth-or-not/).

*""The earnings of employed people are not a legitimate target for taxation""* - they are also, one way or another, the *only* target for taxation (well, apart from inheritance tax - which they want to abolish - and corporation tax -which they want to slash).

**[Defence](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/3040-ukip-defence-position)**

Despite their aforementioned plans to reduce the deficit and slash taxes, they're in favour of bolstering military spending. Their basis for this is a Cold War remark on security from Thatcher, and so we can be ""proud""

**[Same sex marriage](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/2863-ukip-response-to-the-governments-consultation-on-samesex-marriage)**

They're against same-sex marriage because they don't want religions to be forced to marry homosexual couples (which they won't be), they don't want the government to interfere in marriage (which preventing homosexual marriage is), and ""there's no reason to"". This argument has been done to death already, but their policy remains absurd.

[**Energy**](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/2772-keeping-the-lights-on)

Essentially, bog standard climate change denialism.

*""More and more scientists are challenging the conventional wisdom on Global
Warming.""* [Not true](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm). In fact, all of their arguments can be debunked by that same website, so I'll only do one more.

*""The slight warming in the last hundred years is entirely consistent with well-
established, long-term natural climate cycles — the Roman Optimum, the Dark
Ages, the Mediæval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age. And now we seem to be
moving into a new, natural 21st century optimum""* - also [widely debunked](http://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-change-little-ice-age-medieval-warm-period-intermediate.htm).

*""We do not however regard CO 2 as a pollutant. It is a natural trace gas in the atmosphere which is essential to plant growth and life on earth. ""* LOL

I've already ranted on this, but this is a brief list of instances in which the ECHR has held the government to account when British courts and laws were insufficient:-

* Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
* Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
* You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
* It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK)
* You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
* The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
* Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
* Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
* Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)
* Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).
* Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

I have a minimum wage job at the moment... some weeks I get very little hours and sometimes I get a bit more.... this is not a stable job for a man who is 25 years of age and wants to settle down and get married (within the next 3 years anyway) 

I tried university... I couldn't do it, I left and I have no intention of going back... I cannot afford it (used up my student finance, they wont fund me any more... I took the piss pretty much)

I would upset about the University thing, but I know how it does not 100% guarantee me a good job with plenty of people with degrees doing minimum wage jobs. 

SO what should I do? Like I said I am 25 years of age... and no uni degree to go with that. 

Any ideas? I was thinking maybe CCTV operation course or something? any other ideas? what should I do? 

Money is not the ONLY issue here, I also want it to be a bit more of a stable job... I am in love with a wonderful woman and she loves me. Although she doesn't mind a poor fucker like me, I want her to feel secure, and comfortable.

How can we avoid using them when ordering from Amazon.co.uk?,DartBird,290,44,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1jex72/awful_service_from_yodel_how_can_we_avoid_using/,"I just had a really awful experience ordering some things from Amazon. They used a delivery service called Yodel and they are truly terrible. This is what happened:

I ordered the items from Amazon
Yodel tried to deliver them to me but I was out so they gave me a card. ""Your delivery, your call"" they card stated so I went to their website and rescheduled the delivery for the next week since I would be away the next two days.I got an email confirmation.
When I got back there were two more cards for Yodel saying they tried to deliver my parcel.
I call them asking why they ignored the reschedule but they just kept saying they tried delivering to me three times and now I had to go to their service centre in Gatwick to pick it up. I live in Hove and I don't have a car so that would cost me £10 in train fare and take me 3-4 hours. They say they can put in a request for a redelivery the next day but cannot guarantee anything.
I stay in all of the next day but nothing comes. I call them the following day restating everything and they give me the number to the Amazon customer service and tell me to make a complaint!? I call Amazon who also tries to get them to get my parcel to me but they get the same response. Yodel says they can send a request for a redelivery but they cannot guarantee it. So they same story again. I say that's not good enough, now I have to wait for Yodel to send the item back to Amazon and for them to process it to get a refund. End gain: nothing.

TL;dr I rescheduled a delivery from Yodel, they ignored it and not even Amazon could get them to resend it.

I couldn't see anything on who will send my parcel when I ordered though Amazon.co.uk. Is there any way we could still use Amazon but not use Yodel?

UPDATE
My wife complained on twitter and their twitter person responded. Yesterday there was a buzz on the door and the package (that we had decided was going to go back to Amazon for a refund) showed up. The Yodel guy looked really grumpy and the parcel had a note on it to be delivered that morning. An hour later their twitter person email my wife and said she had pulled some strings. Lucky we were in! :) Hopefully these complaints mean they will sort things out.

**UPDATE** Well, it did snow. Nobody turned up for work so I came home and popped into Tesco on the way about 9am (Tesco is on the way home that's why) and there was bread but also people with baskets full of the stuff.

Welcome to the unofficial weather moaning thread for Saturday the 7th of July. On a day where the rain warning has been raised to [AMBER](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18750430) (as in, holy balls it's wet), cars have had to be rescued in Midlothian, Sheepy Magna has been evacuated and the Grand Prix is wet as a duck's arse, I thought we needed a place to vent.

Here's a [link to the BBC weather page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/), and here's a link to my personal favourite weather site, [Weatherspark](http://weatherspark.com/)

So: what's the weather like where you are? Bloody typical, isn't it? Anyone for a cup of tea?

**Edit 1**: WIMBLEDON AND THE GRAND PRIX ARE TEMPORARILY DELAYED. Start building your arks, people, this is it...

**Edit 2**: So both the tennis and the Grand Prix are back on, although it's wet as anything at Silverstone. It seems that most people are having fine weather; my question to you is why aren't you enjoying it?! Today is all the summer you'll be getting for years most likely.

**Edit 3**: Sunny in Cumbria, Blackpool, Birmingham, Leeds, Wimbledon (according to the telly), Newcastle, Preston, York, Kent, Warwickshire; lucky bastards.

---

**Final Edit** Just goes to show we Brits love nothing more than a good moan! Be it too hot, too cold, too wet, too dry, not sunny enough, too sunny, not cloudy enough, not dry enough; what ever it is, we're not happy about it and we love not being happy about it.

Claire perry outright threatened a new reporters job for writing a story, and told him to ""get a life""

While this is common knowledge on this sub and similar sites, A large portion of the UK will purely check ""official news sites"" such as the BBCs. By sharing and viewing the story, the site will gradually move it to the BBC frontpage, where unaware users can hear about the story.

If I was Polish or any other EU Nationality she'd be coming home with me for Christmas.,onlineamiga,281,59,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/12a28d/ive_just_learned_the_hard_way_how_messed_up_the/,"Hi all,

I'll try and not make this long, but I just want to raise awareness of how messed up things are with the UK Immigration system is.  And because of it Christmas has been ruined for us and my family.  TLDR at the bottom!

I'm a British citizen living in Spain with my South Afircan wife. I work  in Gibraltar.  My wife is a full Spanish resident with a residence card (but still holds a South African passport).

EU Laws (Free Movement Rights) clearly state that Resident Family Members of EU Citizens are free to travel anywhere within Europe as long as they are travelling with the EU Citizen.  Which means that my wife is free to travel to the UK with me for a visit home to see family.

Unfortunately the UK don't quite apply this law properly and wont recognise her ID card, as it wasn't issued in the UK.  The EU are currently kicking their ass about it having already threatened them with court.

This left us no option but to apply for what is called an EEA Family Permit. Which is issued to EU Citizens wanting to bring non-eu family members to the UK either to visit or to settle.   It is the UKs way of saying ""We are compliant, but we've bent it a bit! You need a permit then its OK"".  

Ok fair enough. We applied in AUGUST, we finally got an appointment at the British Embassy in Madrid in OCTOBER!  That was a nice 7 hour drive away! Last week they came back to me and refused the application.

Why? Because I, The British citizen work in Gibraltar. Which the UK doesn't see as another EU member state.  If I was any other EU nationality, ie Swedish, Portuguese etc, then I wouldn't even have to prove that I'm working in the first place! But because I am British, I do!   This means that other EU citizens have MORE RIGHTS to bring foreigners into the UK than British citizens do!  They didnt even want any police clearance checks or CRB Checks from my wife. They refused because I work in Gibraltar.  Guess what, Gibraltar is part of the UK yeah? Well she can go there!


Now its too late to appeal and too late to apply for a visit visa.  The EU Commision has responded to a complaint and confirmed the UK are in the wrong.

But its ruined Christmas. For the first time in years my entire family were due to be together. My grandparents are getting old and one of them has been really ill this year. I cant guarantee he'll be around for next Christmas.

Any advice from anyone would be very much appreciated. I'm clutching at straws now on how I can go home for Christmas with my wife.

1375787306.0,215,self.unitedkingdom,1jsz8o,Response From My MP On The Internet Filters Debate,gadhaboy,246,31,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1jsz8o/response_from_my_mp_on_the_internet_filters_debate/,"Dear GadhaBoy,

Thank you for writing to me about the Prime Minister’s proposals to
introduce opt-out web filtering in the hope of tackling online child
abuse and the problem of children accessing pornographic material.

These are two very separate issues. When it comes to child abuse
images, this deals with criminal behavior. ISPs already filter out
sites known to host these, with detailed work done by the Internet
Watch Foundation to manually identify them. This is then typically
followed up with police work to identify those responsible.

The Prime Minister has argued that Google and other internet companies
need to prevent this material from being found. I think they already
do what they can to prevent this illegal material from being provided,
and I think much of the rhetoric from the Prime Minister and others is
based on a misunderstanding of the role of these companies in the
internet – as I understand it, most child abuse imagery is not found
through search engines.

The separate issue of children’s access to pornographic material is a
different one, because this deals with material that is not criminal.
It is of course a serious problem that increasing numbers of children
have access to unsuitable material online and the law does need to
keep pace with technological advances. But censorship is not the
answer.

I have no problem with tools being made available to people who have
an internet connection to allow them to choose whether to apply any
filters. In the same way, people are allowed to run pop-up blockers or
spam filters. However, they should not be forced to implement them,
and there should certainly be no central register of who has decided
not to.

I do have concerns about the filters, however, and it is important
that people understand what they do and do not do. There will be
problems of both over-blocking and under-blocking. Under-blocking will
mean that sites which people think ought to be blocked will not be,
and so it is important that people do not assume a false sense of
security – leaving a young child unsupervised to surf the internet
will not guarantee that they stay within a walled garden, even if they
do not have the technical skill to bypass the controls.

Over-blocking is particular a concern when it filters out websites
such as those offering people advice about a range of subjects such as
sex, bullying and LGBT issues. I believe it would be wholly
irresponsible for the government to prevent young people from
accessing website offering advice and information about subjects which
they may find hard to discuss with family or friends.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding from the Prime
Minister and most MPs and officials about how the internet actually
works, and hence they tend to make suggestions that are not
practically sensible. You can see a more detailed speech I made on
this subject in Parliament, in response to a Labour proposal to take
similar steps to those the Prime Minister is proposing at
http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-06-12a.360.0#g389.0

Thanks again for your email and I hope that this has been helpful.

Yours sincerely,

Julian Huppert
Member of Parliament for Cambridge
