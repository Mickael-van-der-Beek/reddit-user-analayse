I pulled up in the driveway and brought the food to them and the guy paying saw my car and then said hold on, and went inside.

1351009619.0,70,self.DenverBroncos,11yb4l,ESPN Insider Article - Why .500 Broncos are AFC's best,agobayer,80,10,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/11yb4l/espn_insider_article_why_500_broncos_are_afcs_best/,"If there's a favorite team to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl this season, it probably would be the Houston Texans. They have the best record in the conference at 6-1, they just waxed the next-best team (Baltimore) 43-13, and their only loss came at the hands of an NFC squad (Green Bay). Is there any reason to think they won't be hoisting the Lamar Hunt Trophy in January? Actually, yes.

The Texans are not the highest-ranked AFC team in Football Outsiders' latest rankings. That honor goes to the Denver Broncos, perhaps the league's most underrated team.


The Broncos are only 3-3, but that mediocre record is not an accurate reflection of this team's performance this year. Their three losses have come against three division leaders (Houston, Atlanta and New England) with a combined record of 16-4. And it's not as if the teams Denver has beaten are pushovers, either. Pittsburgh, San Diego and Oakland have a combined record of 8-10. All in all, Denver's opponents so far this season have gone 24-14. In that light, a 3-3 record is quite an achievement.

Denver has had the misfortune to play so many good teams so early, but its luck concerning bouncing balls has been even worse. Our research has shown that avoiding and forcing fumbles are definite skills, but actually falling on those balls is mostly a matter of luck. Denver's opponents have fumbled 10 times, but lost only four balls. Even more amazing, the Broncos have fumbled nine times, and their opponents have recovered all of them. All together, the Broncos have recovered only four of 19 total fumbles this season. That kind of bad luck is bound to turn around soon.

The good news for Denver is that their schedule is much easier in the future. The 10 teams left on their slate are a collective 21-42, and only one of them (Baltimore) currently has a winning record. Nothing is certain in the NFL, but it's hard to see Denver missing out on a playoff berth.

Peyton Manning has already made a mark in Denver.
What makes Denver such a quality team? Not surprisingly, it all starts with Peyton Manning. The veteran quarterback ranks fourth in DYAR and first in DVOA among quarterbacks this season (further information on FO's statistics available here), and also leads the league in ESPN's Total QBR. Manning is doing what all great quarterbacks are supposed to do: make his teammates better. Last year, no Denver wideout made the top 50 rankings at FO. This year, the team has three receivers in the top 30.

It's not terribly surprising to see a Peyton Manning-led offense playing well. It's a little more shocking to see how well the Denver defense is playing, especially compared to its conventional statistics. The Broncos rank 11th in yards per game, 10th against the pass, 18th against the rush and 17th in scoring. However, they rank sixth in DVOA. The biggest reason for that difference once again comes down to scheduling. Denver has played some of the league's best offenses in New England, Houston, Atlanta and Pittsburgh. That's going to throw the Broncos' conventional numbers out of whack, but DVOA adjusts for quality of competition and bumps Denver up several slots.

The Denver defense ranks highly in DVOA not so much because they do any one thing at an elite level, but because they have no real weaknesses for opponents to exploit. The unit ranks ninth in rushing DVOA and 10th against the pass. A quick look at our front seven tables shows that they don't get a lot of stuffs, and they do a good job preventing long runs, but they're not terribly far from average in either category. They are sixth in sack rate, but they're not particularly strong or weak in coverage against any category of receiver (except in covering running backs, where they rank fourth). The one thing Denver does do better than most teams is prevent the long ball. They've given up only 16 receptions for 20 yards or more this year, tied for fifth-best in the NFL.

The stars of this Denver defense are somewhat unknown. Safety Mike Adams leads the team in plays (the sum of tackles, interceptions, passes defensed and fumbles forced and recovered), but he's not in the league's top 40 in that category. Wesley Woodyard has been surprisingly effective replacing the suspended D.J. Williams as Denver's top linebacker. He's in the league's top 10 with 23 run stops (tackles on run plays that prevent meaningful yardage toward a new set of downs), nearly matching the career-high 25 he had last season.

The top playmaker, though, has unquestionably been Von Miller. As a rookie in 2011, Miller collected 11.5 sacks, but he was one-dimensional, with only eight defeats (tackles that cause a loss of yardage, turnover or third- or fourth-down stop) against the run. This year, he's even more effective against the pass, with six sacks in six games. Better yet, he has blossomed as an impact run defender. He leads the league with 10 run defeats this year, besting his rookie total with 10 games to go. Only the incomparable J.J. Watt has more total defeats (run and pass) than Miller in 2012. In any other season Miller would be a strong candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, but Watt is virtually a lock to take that hardware home. Could Watt and the Texans defeat Miller's Broncos in a playoff game, though? That's no lock at all.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_11yb4l,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/11yb4l/espn_insider_article_why_500_broncos_are_afcs_best/,

When we make an attempt to decide which quarterback is better, by what criteria are we supposed to judge them by? The number of pro bowls? MVP’s? Superbowls? How about individual statistics? These all have merit. We can go on for days and days shooting back accolade after accolade and get absolutely nowhere. However, I realized this past week why exactly manning is so much better than Brady ever will be. To put it simply, Peyton Fucking Manning is better than Tom Fucking Brady because Peyton knows how to [cut that meat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FlwJwL6kdo). 

Think about it. Think about all the amazing commercials Peyton has done. All those [priceless mastercard moments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N2lwRmnxCE). His masterful [sprint mobile cameo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G0loI0Jn5M). What the fuck has Brady done? All he does is [walk around looking pretty in girl’s shoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAbR4Cml0QA). The clear winner is Manning. When it comes down to how the great ones will be remembered, people don’t give a shit about brady’s 3 rings. Who needs three rings when you can [trash talk like this man?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1_czp59tZs)

1356592419.0,56,self.DenverBroncos,15icjm,ESPN Insider Scouting Report: Week 17 Broncos v Chiefs.,agobayer,69,13,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/15icjm/espn_insider_scouting_report_week_17_broncos_v/,"After watching film of both teams, Scouts Inc. breaks down key elements of the Week 17 Chiefs-Broncos matchup.


• Can Kansas City run the ball? Before the season, interior run defense was perceived to be a major weakness for the Broncos -- but they have played very well. None of these guys are household names (Kevin Vickerson, Justin Bannan, Mitch Unrein, etc.), but they do an excellent job of filling the gaps and playing with good discipline. The only legitimate offensive weapon the Chiefs have is their run game, led by Jamaal Charles. But if he is forced to bounce runs outside all day, chances are he'll get bottled up. The Chiefs' performance last week (352 rushing yards) makes this a lot more interesting and it will catch Denver's attention.

• Can the Chiefs attack Denver's secondary? Denver's corners do a nice job in man coverage and are solid on the edge. The vulnerability of the Broncos' secondary is between the hashes, where you can go after safeties Rahim Moore and Mike Adams with good pass-catching tight ends. These guys are good tacklers and physical versus the run, but they struggle in man-to-man coverage and can be exposed if they bite on play-action in the deep middle of the field. If the Chiefs are running well, that play-action could open up good seam routes.

• How can the Chiefs slow Manning? In reality, they probably can't. The Broncos are really starting to improve their timing in the passing game and Peyton Manning is throwing the ball to spots before his receivers come out of their breaks. That almost makes it impossible to break on the ball with success. Sight adjustments have become a big part of this offense as the receivers are starting to get on the same page with Manning as the play develops. If the Chiefs think they can slow Manning down with the pass rush, keep in mind that he is throwing a lot of short-to-intermediate passes and screens. When the ball comes out this quickly, it is almost impossible to disrupt him.

• Home QB: Manning might be playing the best football of his career, which is saying a lot. His accuracy is pinpoint, he throws to spots before his receivers come out of their breaks and still gets the ball out quickly to avoid sacks. This is not always a vertical passing game, and although we don't see a ton of explosive plays and huge arm strength, Manning's velocity is good enough and he is uncanny in the short-to-intermediate passing game. His ability to gather information before the snap and read defenses may be better than it has ever been. He will use pre-snap movement to get a read on coverages and how to find a good one-on-one matchups or soft spots in zones.

• Away QB: Brady Quinn has decent athletic ability and movement skills, but he has been up and down for his entire career. He forces the ball into tight spots, he doesn't always read coverages well for a guy with his experience and his footwork gets sloppy. Right now, he should concentrate on low-risk passes -- screens, slants, checkdowns to his running backs, etc. Quinn has almost no chance to keep the Chiefs in the game.

• Key positional battle -- Kansas City RT Eric Winston vs. Denver LB Von Miller: Athletically, this looks like a matchup that really favors the Broncos. Miller can move all over the defensive formation to get the matchup he wants, but his normal LOLB position puts him right over Winston, who has outstanding size and a big wingspan. Winston's best shot to slow down Miller is to get his hands on him and try to control him physically. We know Miller wins a lot of battles with first-step quickness, but what people don't realize is how strong he is with the ability to play with leverage and use the bull rush. Winston will need help on Miller with TE blocks and RB chips to slow him down.

• Featured player: Middle linebacker Keith Brooking has revitalized his career and stabilized Denver's defense with his intelligence and consistent play. He really helps between the tackles as a step-up-and-fill guy and is a very good break-down tackler. He also gets this defense lined up properly and is a veteran defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio can depend on to make the right calls.

• Film room nuggets: A good chunk of Manning's TD passes come in the second half games, which is an example of how well he makes early game/halftime adjustments. ... Denver's Trindon Holliday has outstanding explosiveness in the return game, but ball security has been a problem. The Broncos have the reliable Jim Leonhard waiting in the wings as a safer option if they need him.


Prediction

**Denver 31**

Kansas City 14	


This should be a lopsided game if the Broncos decide to go all-out. The wild card here is the Chiefs' run game, which produced 352 yards last week. If the Chiefs can run, it sets up good time of possession and will help to keep Manning off the field.

And don't get me started on the defense. Dumervil &amp; Miller... Two of the scariest defensive names in the league. 

So all in all, you guys had an excellent year. An 11 game winning streak to enter the playoffs, and earning the billing as one of the best teams in the NFL, and having such high hopes to win a super bowl certainly isn't anything to hang your head about.

What you should hang your head on though... is Mr. Fox's decision to take a knee to enter overtime...

Before they trounced the Oakland Raiders, you would have been hard-pressed to find a harder schedule to start the year than the one Denver has faced. A hard-fought win over the Pittsburgh Steelers was followed up with losses to the consensus top two teams in the league right now in the Houston Texans and Atlanta Falcons. Indeed, but for one quarter where Peyton Manning tried to shake off the rust against Atlanta, it's very possible the Broncos could've been walking into Week 5 with a winning record.

Given how they've played, they are certainly deserving.

A lot has been made about the reduced arm strength of Manning after a couple of so-so performances. While it may not be what it once was, Manning doesn't need to be the player he was, he just needs to make the Broncos better than they were -- and that's exactly what he's doing. When Denver was home to the Tebow Show, offensive linemen were asked to pass protect for 3.7 seconds per dropback. With Manning that number is down to 2.5 and the results are evident; through four games the line has given up 23 combined sacks, hits and hurries -- fourth fewest in the league. In the first four games Tebow started last year, that number was 38 and included one game where Denver only had to pass protect nine times.

Manning has made life easier for his line and kept the team facing less pressure (22.8 percent of dropbacks compared to a league-leading 43.4 percent last year). If you've read this piece, you'll know that significantly helps the production of the offense.

When you add in a defense that has two of the league's premier pass-rushers in Elvis Dumervil and Von Miller (who have already combined for 50 quarterback disruptions), an underrated run defense that has benefited greatly from the addition of Justin Bannan and increased playing time for Wesley Woodyard and Kevin Vickerson and a running game that has proved to be more than just the offshoot of a gimmick offense, you've got yourself a formula for a successful team. A lot depends on Manning staying healthy and being able to respond when teams force him to challenge them deep, but the early signs are more encouraging than the overall record.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_10ts3k,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/10ts3k/espn_most_underrated_power_ranked_team_the_denver/,

I'm copy and pasting this from an /r/NFL thread, but I hope you enjoy reading it.

I got a glove from Darrent Williams on September 24, 2006, at a Sunday night game against the Patriots at Gillette. I was actually a Bronco fan as a kid, so I wore my John Lynch jersey to the game and sat near the Broncos tunnel. At the end of the game, I tried to get a glove or high-five from John, but he ran right by me. I was crushed, but Darrent must have seen me, because not a second later I heard a ""Hey kid,"" and he tossed me one of his gloves. I'll never forget how I felt when that happened and was crushed when I heard the news of his death. I have the glove in a shadowbox in my room, I can post a picture for proof if people want. I just felt like sharing that story of a great man taken too early.

Here's a link to the original post and comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/16u5ko/til_that_the_person_who_killed_broncos_cb_darrent/c7zl6dj

FIRST EDIT: Thanks for the interest, guys! Here's the glove in the shadowbox I have. He was a small guy, so the glove actually fits me. All the pics of him on the right were taken during the Pats-Broncos game we attended.

He looked absolutely on point and shrugged off a big hit to throw a TD to Decker on the next play.  Manning's arm isn't yet at 100%, but his accuracy was fantastic today and we fans should be excited about the passing game this season.  Our offensive line is OK, but not great, in pass protection but Manning's pocket awareness is so good that should not be sacked often.

Our offensive line is looking solid, however, in run blocking and expect McGahee to have another great year -- definitely someone to target in fantasy drafts.

Overall, our offense is looking great.  Everyone expects Demaryius and Decker to improve under Manning and this should be the case.  A note on this: Decker played better than Thomas last season and this preseason, I expect him to have a better year than Thomas and be a true breakout star.  He is the guy I'd rather have on my fantasy team and he will be cheaper in drafts.  He caught two TDs today, barely hanging on to the last one.

The same old story defensively: Doom and Gloom give the Broncos and elite pass rush, yet being undersized on the interior of the line ,the Broncos may struggle against the run. We will see how NT Derek Wolf develops.  He's looked good in the preseason but is undersized for a NT.  We will find out about him this season.  Our LB core is average and not great in pass coverage.  

What worries me is our secondary, especially our safeties.  Champ is Champ, put him on the opponents WR #1 and take a nap, but the other positions have not looked great.  This is a unit that was absolutely gashed by the elite QBs last season (Rogers, Stafford, Brady) and, the Broncos only invested one draft pick in the unit (CB Omar Bolden in round 4), deciding to improve via free agency with Tracy Porter and Drayton Florence.  Porter is a solid and a worthy partner to Bailey.

Now, the Safeties, on the other hand.  Rahim Moore is the guy I really worry about.  After looking awful last season, he has struggled this preseason and was completely AWOL on Vernon Davis' 40 yard TD catch in today's game.  People keep talking about his potential, but this is the year for him to deliver.  Carter has shown flashes but needs to improve is sophomore season.  Safeties is without question the great weakness of this team. 

Looking forward to a great season and a deep playoff run!  Go Broncos!

• San Diego must protect the pocket: Denver has arguably the most dynamic pass rush in the NFL as it leads the league in sacks with 31. Defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio is doing an excellent job of designing blitz packages with LB Von Miller and DE Elvis Dumervil coming off the edge, although Dumervil's status will be in question for this game. The Chargers have been among the league's worst when it comes to getting their quarterback sacked and throwing interceptions. Look for more two-tight end sets as the Chargers do whatever it takes to keep Philip Rivers upright.

• Protect the football: The Broncos have fumbled the ball away 12 times, second most in the NFL. RB Willis McGahee has lost four fumbles, most of which have come from fighting for extra yards. You can't keep giving opponents a short field with which to and expect to win all the time. Fortunately for the Broncos, their opponent, the Chargers, have even more giveaways, thanks to their 12 interceptions. This could be a huge factor Sunday.

• Spread the wealth: Few quarterbacks do a better job of distributing the ball to all of his weapons than Peyton Manning. He has six receivers with at least 23 receptions. His pre-snap reads allow Manning to determine early which side of the field to go to and he rarely tries to force the ball to the wrong target. With all the personnel groupings and multiple-receiver sets he has available, it is fun to watch Manning distribute the ball.

• Home QB: Manning is one of the best at pre-snap reads and checking out of bad plays and into good ones. He understands offensive schemes and how to read coverages. He is not the most agile or quick-footed quarterback but has enough foot agility and feel for the rush that he can side step the rush or step up in the pocket to buy time while keeping his eyes downfield. He is definitely a difference-maker and automatically gives his team a chance to win.

• Away QB: Rivers has prototypical dimensions for the position along with a strong arm that allows him to make all the throws necessary at this level. He can be a precise passer who hits narrow windows and has enough foot quickness and agility to buy time, although he works more effectively from a solid pocket. He has a tendency to force some throws and has been haunted by inconsistency for pretty much his whole career. When he is on he can compete with the best, and will make his receivers look good by putting the ball where only they have a chance to catch it.

• Key positional battle -- Broncos' DEs vs. Chargers' OTs: I'm including Miller with Denver's defensive ends as he often gets down in a three-point stance to be an edge rusher on passing downs. Denver brings a lot of heat off the edge with Miller and Dumervil, or Dumervil's replacement, coming from the outside. San Diego's tackles will have their hands full as they try to contain these two. They'll need to be on top of their game.

• Featured player: San Diego needs a big game from RB Ryan Mathews. You can't get into a track meet if you want to beat Manning and these Broncos. If Mathews can get on track and help his Chargers eat up a lot of the clock and maintain good field position, the Chargers can keep the ball out of Manning's hands.

• Film room nuggets: WR Demaryius Thomas is finally showing why the Broncos drafted him in the first round in 2010. He is showing consistency and big-play ability. He has caught 71 percent of the passes thrown his direction and has become a lot more precise in his route running. ... Rivers is throwing a higher percentage of interceptions this year. but it's not all his fault. He was able to throw a lot more passes into crowds when he had Vincent Jackson, as Jackson would win more than his share of jump balls. ... Broncos LB Keith Brooking has definitely lost a step over the years, but his ability to get the defense lined up and make the right calls makes him invaluable.


Prediction
	
**Denver 31**

San Diego 21	

San Diego has yet to beat a team with a .500 or better record, and it's not apt to happen this week. Denver can score from so many different ways and will be too much for the Chargers' defense.

[A Pie Graph!](http://imgur.com/2mFAQfA)

Offensive Needs to be addressed prove to be limited; the broncos could look to pick up a bit of depth at WR late in the draft.  Runningback is interesting due to the amount of players still on contract with the Broncos although Fannin may get the boot due to injury issues.  Moreno is guaranteed $2.3M of his contract is basically uncuttable due to that.  Kuper is guaranteed $2.7M and may be used as trade bait due to his injury status and the emergence of Zane Beadles.  With Welker signing I doubt the Broncos will look for a full time FB, and instead opt to use Jacob Hester and Unrein in goal line situations

Strengths: QB, WR, T, G. Weaknesses: WR depth

K: Prater $3.3M

Special Teams CAP: $5.6M

Defensive needs become adding a pass rushing DE additional depth to DE and DT, as well as potentially a SS.  Having 4 active players DTs and 3 DEs as the Broncos do currently is not feasible and look for draft picks to be used to fill these holes.  There is talk about bringing Dumervil back onto the team or perhaps going after Umi or Freeney, which are possible additions, the Broncos may also look at the draft where there are several high value DEs that still would be available at 28.  Starter wise the Broncos may not target a high value DT in the draft an instead look to use a rotation of Vick, Knighton and Unrein with Wolfe on 3rd downs.  Linebacker wise the broncos are in trouble, having 7 active LBs is not feasible, and I do not believe Trevathan or Johnson still has PS eligibility.  Look for cuts to bring this number to 6 active LBs.  On the block may be Mays, Johnson or Irving and this decision will probably be made during training camp.  With Rogers-Cormartie look for the Broncos to target CBs in the late rounds, Bolden has injury history and the Broncos will need to acquire 1 more starter.  
I had previously stated the necessity of 3rd CB as Del Rio’s defense employed on average 4.95 DBs on the field per snap.

Strengths: LB, CB

Weaknesses: DE, 3 down DTs, DE DT CB depth, expensive contracts

Cap room: Dumervil’s release opened up $8.75M in cap space putting the Broncos between $10M-13M depending on the details of our recent signings.  Draft picks at our position should be expected to eat around $4.5M of cap.

The Broncos have 52/53 starters signed at this point

And that is the current state of the Broncos

1351790893.0,44,self.DenverBroncos,12gtcx,ESPN Insider Scouting report: Broncos - Bengals,agobayer,53,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/12gtcx/espn_insider_scouting_report_broncos_bengals/,"After watching film of both teams, Scouts Inc. breaks down key elements of the Week 9 Broncos-Bengals matchup.


• Slow down Green: A.J. Green is an elite wideout who is nearly impossible to stop. Andy Dalton looks for Green in a big way in the red zone, and as Green goes, so goes the Bengals' offense. Tight ends have been giving Denver a lot of problems, as its linebackers and safeties can be exploited in coverage, but Jermaine Gresham has been disappointing this season as both a receiver and blocker. Still, Denver's secondary has consistently improved as this season has gone along, especially with its cornerbacks. And Champ Bailey is still playing at a high level. Drew Brees threw for just 213 yards in Denver last week.

• Get Atkins blocked: While the Broncos' pass protection is very good and Peyton Manning is extremely difficult to sack, getting Geno Atkins blocked as an interior pass-rusher will be a difficult chore. And Denver is semi-weak at center. Out of their double-tight end sets, the Broncos will keep Joel Dreessen in to block in protection more than Jacob Tamme. Although left tackle Ryan Clady has had a great season, Dreessen could help out against Bengals defensive end Carlos Dunlap in this contest. Manning operated from a clean pocket last week and was simply lethal when utilizing multiple-tight end groupings.

• Harass Dalton: Bengals left tackle Andrew Whitworth remains a rock in protection on the blind side, and, surprisingly, Denver sacked Brees only once. Rookie Derek Wolfe is an interesting player because of his versatility. When Denver shows a three-man front, he handles the defensive end position. But he's usually a heavy-base defensive end on early downs in the Broncos' 4-3. But what Wolfe does best is attack the quarterback from an interior alignment on passing downs, and he benefits in this regard from all the attention that Von Miller and Elvis Dumervil garner on the outside.

• Home QB: At his best, Dalton is an efficient player who relies on ball placement and timing to get his receivers in positions to make plays. When these areas of Dalton's game fail, he can become a liability. The bye week should have done him good to get back to maximizing his talents. Although he doesn't have a big arm, Dalton has done well outside the numbers this season. This offense has not been very efficient on third downs, an area in which Dalton must improve.

• Away QB: Manning's mobility is as good as ever, and outside of the Falcons game (Week 2), he is not turning over the ball. As usual, Manning is handling and defeating the blitz extremely well. This is especially important this week because the Bengals' pass defense has had a tough time when it rushes four or fewer. Manning has been lethal outside the numbers, but most of those completions have been short. He has been terrific in the second halves of games and also has been quite good on third downs. His safety blanket, slot man Brandon Stokley, has been quite effective this season moving the chains.

• Key positional battle -- Bengals' RBs vs. Broncos' front seven: BenJarvus Green-Ellis is a volume runner who will not create a lot on his own. The Broncos' defense is better vs. the run than the pass, but the Bengals are better blocking as pass-protectors instead of in the run game. While right guard Kevin Zeitler has been exceptional in his rookie season, the center position is very poor for the Bengals. A guy to keep an eye on is Wesley Woodyard, an undersized linebacker who covers a ton of ground for the Broncos. He's a playmaker vs. the run and in coverage and was all over the field last week. The Saints rushed for 51 yards in Denver.

• Featured player: Demaryius Thomas is in the midst of a breakout season and is one of the most productive wide receivers in the league. Manning has been very effective with his deep ball, so expect him to take shots downfield to Thomas. Opposing wideouts haven't produced very well against the Bengals' defense, but tight ends have done plenty of damage. Still, Cincinnati's secondary isn't very strong overall and Thomas' outstanding blend of size, downfield speed, power and ability after the catch will prove extremely challenging.

• Film room nuggets: Vontaze Burfict has been a very nice find for the Bengals. The undrafted free agent has very good size and movement skills for a big linebacker. He plays with a nasty edge and has excelled as a run defender in particular. ... Willis McGahee has been very consistent with his hard-charging interior running along with strong cutback runs, but it might soon be time to utilize Ronnie Hillman more to lighten McGahee's load. Hillman, the youngest player in the NFL, has the makings of a dangerous receiver and has explosive lateral agility, but it is questionable if the coaching staff trusts him in pass protection.



Prediction

**Denver 30**

Cincinnati 13	

Cincinnati is coming off its bye, while the Broncos are going on the road after a dominating Sunday night win against New Orleans. Denver's defense against Brees was the real story of that night. The Broncos are the far superior team in this matchup.

Manning loves to play his no huddle offense so keep the defense from getting comfortable and catch their breath.  It works time and time again.  When Manning is on the the sidelines, you do not see him watching the game, you see him with the playbook hashing out the next series.  He then does one huddle and gives them the next couple plays.  When you have refs that are constantly stopping the game for reviews, bad calls, and over all time wasting, the lost Mannings momentum.  The defense got time to rest and reset.  This allowed them to always keep the threat of pressure on Manning.

My dad came up to talk to me, and he said to me, ""this is what it's like to be a Broncos fan. I had to sit through those Super Bowls in the 80s. I watched when it was 55-10. I watched the game in 96 when we lost to an expansion team. You will live with disappointment. But all of this just makes it that much better when they finally do win it.""

At the beginning of this season, it was speculated that the Broncos would be in the Andrew Luck Lottery.

While a Super Bowl would have been awesome, and we would be typing ""TEBOW"" at least 5,000 times each, let's face it. The Broncos were not championship caliber.

The Broncos, however, were playoff caliber. And they proved it. Tebow has a LOT to learn as does the rest of the team. With a new coaching staff and second-year players being the central figures, it brought an optimistic outlook to the future of the Broncos.

While I may have had about a fifth of Jack during and after the game, the pain is over and gone, and it's time to look forward to next year. The Broncos went from 4-12 to a team in the Divisional Playoffs.

Really good. Manning seemed to throw to D. Thomas a lot(who seemed to have no trouble with an expanded route tree). Decker had his fair share as did the TEs(Tamme and Dreesen). Manning is so impressive in person. His timing and reads are impeccable. He makes throwing look so easy.

Franklin was starting at RT and Kuper was in there as well. Looks like Harris is going to be a backup. 

Greg Orton was the surprise of the day at WR. Dude was catching everything and had a wild grab for a TD with the corner all over him. It was a deep ball.

Hard to say much about the D and the running game without seeing them in pads.

They spent a fair amount of time on punt returns with Decker, Porter, Florence, Thompson and Bolden getting most of the work. Unfortunately Decker and Porter looked the most reliable. I'd rather those two get the chance to focus on their primary positions and not have to worry about returns. 

Osweiler was impressive(for a backup). From what I saw he looked at least as good as Weber and Hanie. He made a couple of mistakes but not as many as Hanie or Weber. Hanie seemed to have a lot of passes deflected and Weber just looked ineffective. Osweiler's passes were mostly on target and seemed very catchable(considering he was throwing to second and third team recievers.

Scheme wise everything was very vanilla. They pretty much stayed with 2 wrs 2 tes and 1 rb, although occassionally it was 2 wrs 1 te and 2 rbs(if you consider Gronkowski a fb). But from that they used a lot of movement, including moving from under center to shotgun. Never saw any sub packages, but what they did do looked really solid. I would say Manning has plenty of chemistry with the recievers that matter at this point. 

I was surprised to see a couple of flea flickers in there as well. One with Hanie and 1 from Manning. 

All in all a nice way to start the training camp part of the season.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,,True,t3_x7ez7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/x7ez7/my_firsthand_account_of_the_broncos_first_practice/,

1373151852.0,34,self.DenverBroncos,1hru96,Got two jerseys from a Chinese wholesale company and wanted to give a testimony.,cubedG,43,9,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/1hru96/got_two_jerseys_from_a_chinese_wholesale_company/,"Over the past couple of weeks I've seen a number of threads with questions about jerseys and what sites are legitimate and trustworthy and which ones aren't. With my order just arriving I'd thought I'd give you all my experience.

I initially started looking into the chinese market after realizing that many of the jerseys at nfl shop and other domestic sites are really above what I'm willing to pay for something that willing only be worn days out of the year. I got my two jerseys from http://www.wholesalebusinesscn.net/. Their prices are mostly in and around $20 for all jerseys and shipping is about the same and takes roughly 10 days. I ordered both a Nike Elite Champ jersey and a Mitchell &amp; Ness Atwater jersey. 

[Here is an album of the details on both jerseys.]( http://imgur.com/a/KfiZ1)

**Pros:**

* The quality of the fabric was impressive. Very durable and breathable. 
* Customer service was great. I was able to exchange emails with them throughout the whole process and they answered all my questions. 
* Quality stitching on the the numbers. The look like the real deal. 

**Cons:** 

* Some excess stitching on the Champ jersey, especially on the NFL logo. Nothing scissors can't fix though.
* Continuous stitching between numbers and letters. As you can see on the bottom patch on the Atwater jersey, the stitching runs between letters. Easy fix. 

Overall I was very pleased with the process and the product. The minor mistakes are well worth the low cost of $22 as opposed to the authentic $100+ jerseys you'll find elsewhere. I'd definitely recommend going this route to anyone contemplating it. I hope I was able to help some of you guys out who are on the fence about going the wholesale route.

If you have any questions or would like more pictures I'll be sure to address that in the comments. Also don't hesitate to email them, they probably know more about the product than I do.

'But alas, the Bird Demons from the East have felled our plans, bringing much disappointment to our people.

'The AFC West has grown in strength. The Walrus Lord has taken control of the Chiefs and dares to challenge us. Mike McCoy has left us to lead the Heretic Chargers. Even the Heathens in Oakland would dare to oppose us.

'Other enemies in the East would spoil our destiny of Greatness, as well. The greatest of all evils, The Belichick, has made a fatal error: He has released a dangerous enemy who could become an immensely powerful ally...

'I shall deliver this most impressive weapon unto you, Peyton. You must wield him well, and may he be a great asset to the army with which I have supplied you.

'Ride forth, oh Peyton, ride forth with your brothers Welker, Decker, and Thomas, and may you be The Four Horsemen, and whence you go follows victory for our Broncos, for our Lord Bluecifer, for the Great Stallion Thunder!

'Ride now! Conquer the West again, and foil those who brought shame to you a season ago!'

**Free Agency/Draft Concerns**

Here are the four positions that I feel need to be looked at:

* Nose Tackle
* Safety
* Cornerback
* Runningback

The Broncos have a nice ~14 million to sit on right now, but with the recent tag of LT Ryan Clady, it would be hard to say that the Broncos are going to be looking for more players in Free Agency. With certain gaps appearing brightly in the secondary during the postseason, an aging McGahee, and slightly unreliable running backs, perhaps the Broncos might use young talent in the draft to fill these holes. Perhaps the Broncos could look for a Running Back in free agency, but this might only happen if those free agent running backs are willing to take a bit of a pay cut in order to achieve that championship--something Denver is 
definitely a contender for.

###Highs and Lows

**High Points**

* First and foremost, we signed Peyton effin Manning, one of the greatest QBs to ever play the game. Despite all the doubts on him (*Peyton is just one hit away* this, *he'll never be good again* that), Peyton went on to have one of his greatest seasons in history. Backed by our top 10 (I'd dare to say top 5!) defense, Denver is a major contender in the Super Bowl race for next year. Now, you didn't hear it from me, [but...](http://i.imgur.com/scKu7sP.png ""relax, it's a joke"") Peyton and Adrian Peterson of the Vikings both put up great seasons, but I'm glad to see Peyton come back with the Comeback Player of the Year Award.
* How about that Denver D? Last year we were pulling a pretty damn mediocre 20th ranked defense, letting up 24.4 points per game (itself 24th in the league) and 357.8 Yards per game. In a fantastic turnabout, our defense broke not just top 10 under DC Jack Del Rio, but even top 5--pushing Pittsburgh for the #1 overall. That is a damn impressive improvement no matter how you look at it and is looking to be improved in the upcoming season.
* Game one against the Steelers. It looked shaky at times, but Peyton really proved that he still has it during that game--and it was only game one of the season. Tracy Porter picking off Roethlisberger to seal the game in the same way he did to Peyton in the Super Bowl was an odd yet amazing moment.
* The first game against San Diego. Words can't express how furious I was after the first half. We were down a whopping 24-0 points at halftime, and neither the defense nor the offense seemed to be clicking. But in came (as Mr. Jon Gruden would call him) The Sheriff, and the defense shut out the Chargers will pulling off crucial turnovers, and meanwhile Peyton got the offense rolling in a way that only the greatest QBs can do. As simple as it is, [the announcer really put it the best.](http://youtu.be/t6jqdHyMSks?t=1m40s)
* Every game after the bye week. To go 3-3 into the Bye, and come out 13-3 and the #1 Seed in the whole conference...you cannot deny Denver being a good team, especially with the downright thrashing they gave to Baltimore in Baltimore. ~~If only that could have continued in the playoffs.~~

**Low Points**

* The secondary had a couple glaring holes all season. Overall they played great, but I feel like they could play better.
* Peyton's three picks in the first Quarter at Atlanta. That did not help the argument against Peyton and whether or not he was good, and it lead to a pretty ugly loss--even if the final score differential was only 6 points.
* Struggling against other division heads. Despite our thrashing of Baltimore, we did not beat any teams that ended up as the #1 team in their division, and that *is* a problem. Even though we thrashed Baltimore, they got the last laugh in the end.
* The Chiefs game in Arrowhead. I'm not sure what happened that game, but it was incredibly damn ugly. We were averaging a high amount of points per game, and only being able to put up 17 points against that only had one win at the time was pretty damn dissapointing. 
* The second Baltimore game. Peyton throwing 2 picks, letting up those TD bombs to Joe Flacco, coach Fox's over conservative play calling...that game was a mess.

1354287531.0,36,self.DenverBroncos,141xn9,ESPN Insider Scouting Report: Broncos - Bucs,agobayer,45,9,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/141xn9/espn_insider_scouting_report_broncos_bucs/,"Edit: Looks like a lot of people from both teams are tuning into this article this week, so far there has been some great discussion, lets keep the conversation civil, if you dont mind. 



After watching film of both teams, Scouts Inc. breaks down key elements of the Week 13 Buccaneers-Broncos matchup.


• Tampa Bay must dominate the clock: The Buccaneers need a strong ground game with a controlled passing attack that allows them to dominate time of possession and limit Denver QB Peyton Manning's opportunities to come up with big plays. The Bucs can't afford to get into a high-scoring affair with the Broncos as they simply don't have the dynamic players on offense that Denver has.

• Make Freeman uncomfortable in the pocket: Denver has one of the most dynamic pass-rush packages in the NFL. With 37 sacks on the season, the Broncos have the ability to force Buccaneers QB Josh Freeman into bad throws. Although Freeman has the quickness and athleticism to extend plays, he is much more effective when throwing from a solid pocket. Look for LB Von Miller and DE Elvis Dumervil to bring a lot of heat, especially if this defense is playing with a lead and Tampa Bay has to throw to catch up.

• Running back by committee: Denver was dealt a major blow with the loss of all-everything RB Willis McGahee (knee). Not only do the Broncos need to replace his running skills, but McGahee is one of the better blockers in the league when it comes to blitz pickup and is a solid receiver out of the backfield. Look for a lot of situational substituting in Denver's backfield.

• Home QB: Manning is a future Hall of Famer who is still a difference-maker in spite of his missing a year due to injury as well as his age. He doesn't have the arm strength of some quarterbacks, but he gets the ball to where it needs to be. He is one of the best when it comes to making pre-snap reads and getting his team into successful plays, and few quarterbacks are better at bringing a team back with fourth-quarter drives.

• Away QB: Freeman is a rising star but is still on the inconsistent side. He can make all the throws you need to make at this level and can be extremely accurate when he is on his game. When the ground game is going strong, Freeman finds a lot of his success off the play-action fake. He has really improved on his ability to lead his receivers away from coverage; the Bucs' receivers are among the league's best when it comes to gaining yards after the catch. Where he needs to improve is in his ability to convert on third-and-long situations.

• Key positional battle -- Broncos' receivers vs. Buccaneers' secondary: Denver is a team that, especially with the loss of McGahee, needs to throw to win. The Broncos' receivers are all good route runners and do a great job of catching the ball in traffic. Tampa Bay is one of the best teams in the NFL when it comes to ball-hawking and has a lot of guys who can play the ball, although the Bucs will be missing their top cover cornerback, Eric Wright, due to a suspension. Manning does not throw many interceptions and could have a big day against this decimated secondary.

• Featured player: Doug Martin, who was held to 50 yards on 21 carries by the Atlanta Falcons in Week 12, needs to show up big in Denver. A strong ground game will not only slow down Denver's dynamic pass rush but will help to keep the ball out of the hands of Manning and his explosive offense.

• Film room nuggets: Buccaneers LT Donald Penn has been an elite lineman for the past few years but doesn't get enough credit. He may lack prototypical dimensions for the position but is a great foot athlete with the ability to keep his pad level down and his weight over his feet. He rarely gets out of position and has an excellent sense of leverage. ... Buccaneers TE Dallas Clark has lost a step over the years and will struggle against quality man coverage, but he is still extremely effective when facing zone schemes. ... Denver may have the league's top speed rushers coming off the edge in Miller and Dumervil. These guys are explosive with their first steps and have developed a nice set of counter moves for when speed alone won't get the job done.


Prediction

**Denver 27**

Tampa Bay 17	

The Buccaneers are one of the NFL's top teams when it comes to picking off passes, but they are the worst team when it comes to giving up passing yards. Against a quarterback like Manning, you can't count on many turnovers.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,1354292908.0,,ocd,True,t3_141xn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/141xn9/espn_insider_scouting_report_broncos_bucs/,
1351616928.0,38,self.DenverBroncos,12ch1v,ESPN Insider Article - The NFL's best QB (so far),agobayer,43,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/12ch1v/espn_insider_article_the_nfls_best_qb_so_far/,"Peyton Manning is playing better than any other quarterback in the NFL in 2012, and there is a lot of evidence to prove it.

The problem is, after his year off, we might be too interested in monitoring how far ""back"" he is to realize it.

It could remind you a little of another triumphant return. Remember when Michael Jordan announced just how ""back"" he was after a self-imposed exile to Double-A baseball? It happened in Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995, two weeks into his comeback. Jordan looked like the scorer of old as he torched the Knicks for 55 points, but the game was won when, with his team tied late, Jordan drove the lane and, instead of elevating over Patrick Ewing for the game-winning shot, dished the ball off to an open Bill Wennington for a game-winning layup.

While MJ proved he still had nearly every skill that had made him previously unstoppable, there also was at least the question of whether this was some new player, a cagier veteran who, while still brilliant, was more cognizant of some newly realized limitations. It had been two years. And even MJ hinted at it, saying after the game, ""My first notion was to shoot it. I would be lying if I said I was going to pass the ball. I was going to make them stop me, but I was able to get the ball to the open man.""

Self-aware MJ would have been a good storyline, but it didn't last because it couldn't. The days went on, and it was the same Jordan -- a me-first scorer at heart but also a win-at-all-costs competitor just resourceful enough to realize when that alpha status could be a tool for deception. It was the same player who, on his final play before that exile, had driven the lane late and dished the ball off, allowing John Paxson to seal a championship.

Now cut to Peyton.

While we busily debate what he has left, he is on pace to throw for more than 4,800 yards -- more than he has ever thrown in a season. While we monitor his progress, he also leads the NFL in Total QBR, and if you drop a six-minute stretch against Atlanta during which he tossed three of his four interceptions on the season, he'd be well ahead in passer rating, too (currently second).

Yes, it's early, but Manning is playing as well as he ever has, particularly in the context of how it's being done. But we're caught up in a different form of evaluation, just as we were ever so briefly with MJ, gauging his current performance against the past.

Just consider how we're judging Manning -- and what we're missing.

One of the major questions that has dominated early evaluations of Manning's return is whether he still has arm strength. His deep balls are fluttering. What did all those neck surgeries sap from his strength? What did they mean for the nerves that run down the back of that right arm? Well, those mallards are fluttering, and landing, brilliantly. Manning has gone 11-for-17 on throws more than 20 yards downfield over his past four games, throwing four touchdowns and zero interceptions.

* Comp	11	T-1st

* Comp pct	64.7	T-1st

* TD-Int	+4	T-1st

* Total QBR 100.0T-1st

On the season, his accuracy percentage on deep passes, defined as throws of 20-plus yards in the air, is 56 percent, according to ProFootballFocus. He is essentially tied with Drew Brees (56.3) for the NFL lead.
Is this a cagier Manning, one who gets the ball out earlier on deep throws to compensate for a dwindling fastball? In a word, no. Mel Kiper's 1997 draft evaluation of Manning stated that the Tennessee quarterback had ""an underrated arm,"" even though that's a problem area. We can question whether Manning has lost some velocity, but the common perception always has been that Manning isn't a great deep passer based on arm strength, just an accurate one. In 2010, the year before the neck surgeries, Manning's deep-ball accuracy was at 37 percent. Manning is no worse at throwing the deep ball than he ever was, be it in Knoxville or Indianapolis, and it was never a strength in the first place. He has succeeded on deep throws because the key always has been anticipating the route coming open, not just delivering strikes.

What about his mobility? In the ""Monday Night Football"" win over San Diego, Manning hurdled a defender, a ""leap"" that deserved a laugh track. It wasn't some momentary renaissance for No. 18, just another moment to laugh at a player who always has run like he was pulling a monster-truck tire in a training session. That same 1997 draft report noted that ""Manning will never win a race"" but has ""just enough maneuverability to get past the first defender."" Even with a 12-inch leap.


Manning has been hit while throwing just four times in 2012 and sacked just 10 times, tied for 26th in the NFL. He is dropped on less than 3 percent of dropbacks. This even as the Denver offensive line performs almost identically in pass blocking as it did in 2011. That's because Manning's real mobility starts before the snap. No QB is more a master at getting his O-linemen set up properly or making pre-snap reads. He is a clever statue and among the NFL's hardest quarterbacks to sack, same as it ever was.

We could suggest Manning's weapons in Denver are far better than anticipated. Demaryius Thomas, whose route tree at Georgia Tech was a cactus, finally looks like the first-round talent he is. Eric Decker officially has invaded the fantasy space. And the presence of the ageless Brandon Stokley adds familiarity. But again, we know better. The same group of pass-catchers who many believed held Tim Tebow back in 2011 aren't now responsible for an air attack completing passes at a 20 percent higher rate. Manning, as always, is maximizing the talent around him and adjusting as he allows defenses to dictate what he does. As Kiper wrote in 1997, ""Players have told me Manning knows what's going on [on the field] as well as most offensive or defensive coordinators."" Has anything changed?

**Late Fate
Peyton Manning when trailing in second half this season (* - NFL leader):**

Stat	2012

* TD-Int	9-0*

* Comp pct	66.7

* Pass yds	795

* Total QBR	 93.4*

This is particularly evident late in games. With more time to diagnose, he is getting more results. As such, this older, damaged Manning isn't getting worn out; he's getting even. This season, he has thrown nine touchdowns and zero interceptions when trailing in the second half. No other quarterback has a differential higher than plus-4. His 93.4 Total QBR in those situations is the best in the NFL.

While the results show just a 3-3 record for Denver, those losses are to Atlanta, Houston and New England. Denver has played one of the toughest early schedules, all while breaking in a new version of its old star.

Except this isn't a new version. Just like Jordan.

After he came back, MJ showed he hadn't really changed at all. Maybe he couldn't jump quite as high, but he probably was even more determined to prove it didn't matter. His assist rate dropped while he led the NBA in scoring for the next three seasons.

That's the thing about great athletes. We like to credit late-career success to some innate ability to adapt, but being great often just means that even the older, diminished version is better than most.

Manning might eventually look merely good as the athlete in him fades. And this by no means is an argument that he's the best QB in the NFL, period. We know that's not the case. But Manning has been the best quarterback early in 2012 in part because he was never a brilliant athlete in the first place.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_12ch1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/12ch1v/espn_insider_article_the_nfls_best_qb_so_far/,

1353133037.0,33,self.DenverBroncos,13cbb8,"Don't ignore Denver D, Insider piece ",Richa5280,39,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/13cbb8/dont_ignore_denver_d_insider_piece/,"With Peyton Manning running the show now, the Denver Broncos' offense gets most of the attention and publicity -- and that is certainly fair -- but if you focus on only one side of the ball, you're going to miss a key part of Denver's resurgence. What I found when I broke down Denver's defense was really surprising. This may be the most improved unit in the NFL from a year ago.

What strikes you on film is how fast the Broncos' defense plays, how the players can mix and match their pressures and schemes, how fundamentally sound they are ... and most surprising is how much depth the Broncos have and how many players are making contributions.

Let's look at them on all three levels and get to know this defense a little better.

Defensive line

The Broncos have made a nice transition under coordinator Jack Del Rio from a 3-4 to a 4-3 front and they are playing it much better than most people expected.

The only marquee player on this line is DE Elvis Dumervil, who is really a hybrid edge guy -- a relentless pass-rusher who plays with great quickness and also surprising strength and leverage. A lot of his success comes against bigger and stronger right offensive tackles and he already has seven sacks. The rest of this group is journeymen who are playing the best football of their careers.

Derek Wolfe plays DE opposite Dumervil, while the inside starters are Justin Bannan and Kevin Vickerson -- and the Broncos are getting quality backup snaps from Mitch Unrein and Robert Ayers. That combination gives them a nice and fairly deep rotation. They really show a variety of pre-snap looks and fronts with a lot of guys in the up position before the snap. The offense doesn't know who is coming and who is actually dropping into coverage.

The Broncos love to show blitz looks with this defensive line, but when the ball is snapped they often rush only three and drop one guy out, especially if OLB Von Miller is in his pass-rush mode. They play a lot of mind games at the line of scrimmage with twists and stunts and their chemistry at orchestrating these moves is very impressive. They seem to hit every gap in their pass rush and all of this movement really confuses offensive lines.

As movement oriented as they are, they have excellent gap discipline. They don't leave big lanes to run through and they set the edge nicely versus the outside run to force things back inside. You have to love the versatility of this group as outside guys can play inside, and vice versa. They can all zone drop at times, they sniff out the screen play, they are solid, wrap-up tacklers and they get their hands up to deflect passes. They may not be elite individual players, but as a group they are really sound at a position that was the weakness of this team a year ago.

Linebackers

Much like the defensive line, there is one game-changer in this unit -- OLB Von Miller -- and he may be the best defensive player in the NFL right now.

He is used in a variety of roles -- he lined up as a spy in Week 10 versus Cam Newton, he can drop into coverage -- but his best asset is as an edge pass-rusher, as evidenced by his 10 sacks. When you study him on film he is almost unblockable and relentless in his effort. While he has terrific moves and quickness, like Dumervil he really has excellent strength and leverage and he can physically bull-rush a lot of OTs back into the quarterback. There are times that he will line up on the same side of the formation as Dumervil and when they go to that overload blitz they can be almost impossible to block.

Weakside linebacker D.J. Williams is back this week from a league-imposed suspension, but he will be hard-pressed to get his starting spot back because Wesley Woodyard has done a great job in his place. Woodyard leads this defense with 77 tackles and he is all over the field.

When you add young players Nate Irving and Danny Trevathan to the mix along with Williams, the Broncos have five guys who can give them productive snaps and versatility in their personnel packages.

Inside is veteran Keith Brooking, who no longer has great speed and cover skills, but he is smart and can get everybody lined up properly. The coaches have good options to replace him when they go to their sub-packages against the pass.

Like the defensive line, this unit sniffs out screens well, the linebackers string out run plays very well, they play sideline to sideline and they really do a good job of protecting their body and not getting ""hooked."" In coverage they will show combo looks with zone drops and occasional man-to-man schemes, but coverage is not their strength. There are a lot of underrated moving parts to this unit.

Bailey
Ron Chenoy/US PresswireChamp Bailey continues to be a force in the Denver secondary.

Secondary

Like the other two units on this defense, there is one elite difference-maker -- CB Champ Bailey. A lot of people assumed he would be an inside corner over the slot in 2012 as his speed declined, but in recent weeks he is covering the opponent's best wide receiver, usually outside, and his ball skills and instincts make up for any speed that he might have lost.

Veteran Tracy Porter has missed some time due to injury, but young Chris Harris has filled in admirably both in coverage and run support. When Porter is healthy and you add Tony Carter to the mix, the Broncos have four corners whom they can count on in nickel/dime packages.

Inside, starting safeties Rahim Moore and Mike Adams are solid in run support, tackle well and they are adequate in zone coverage. Their one weakness: Good pass-catching tight ends who attack the middle of the field give them trouble, especially if the offense catches the Broncos in their base package with Brooking on the field at middle linebacker. This is something that Denver needs to fix.

Ex-Jets safety Jim Leonhard gives the Broncos depth and intelligence and he brings a stabilizing presence to the back end of this defense. They will show a lot of variety in their coverages with tight man, man-off, zone schemes and we will see some Cover 2 and Cover 1 looks -- but their preference is probably in man schemes. These guys fly to the football, they do a nice job of ""baiting"" WRs by playing off coverages and then jumping routes.

Their most productive blitz is to bring a corner or safety off the slot and with overload pressures where they can send Miller inside the OT and open up the edge for the blitz package. The Broncos' tendency to jump routes could lead to problems against double moves by WRs, but so far it has not been a major problem. Like the other two units on this defense, this secondary flies to the ball, the Broncos tackle and they don't make a lot of mistakes.

So, what do the numbers say about this defense? Well, it gives up fewer big passing plays than any defense in the NFL. The Broncos are second in sacks. They are second in rushing yards allowed. And with an offense that is scoring a lot of points, this defense often plays with a lead ... and when that happens the Broncos can tee it up and attack opposing offenses much like we saw when Peyton Manning was in Indianapolis.

The film tells you that this defense is not a fluke. The Broncos have difference-makers on all three levels and they play together and with enthusiasm. And they are not going away. AFC teams should prepare themselves accordingly.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,,True,t3_13cbb8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/13cbb8/dont_ignore_denver_d_insider_piece/,

• Oakland found its ground game: After struggling during the first two weeks of the season, last week the Raiders found their lost ground game and did so against one of the stronger defenses in the league. RB Darren McFadden put up 113 rushing yards on Pittsburgh with 6.3 yards per carry. He ran with authority and did a good job of getting his shoulders square to the line of scrimmage and hitting the holes with good body tilt while showing good balance on contact to gain extra yards. Look for more of the same as the Raiders travel to Denver this week.

• Denver needs to attack the Raiders on the perimeter: While the Broncos lack great overall team speed on the perimeter, they do have good short- to intermediate-range receivers. The Raiders have struggled to cover anyone this year and are not generating much of a pass rush coming off the edge. Look for Peyton Manning and company to go with a lot of no-huddle offense with the quarterback getting the ball out quickly and into the hands of his playmakers out in space.

• Denver needs to contain the run with its base defensive front: The Broncos are holding opponents to just 2.63 yards per carry, fourth lowest in the NFL, and 71 yards per game, seventh lowest. This week they need to limit Oakland's ability to gain positive yards on early downs and force them into a passing game. When McFadden and the Raiders are able to get their offense into a lot of second- or third-and-short situations, it makes Carson Palmer that much more effective.

• Home QB: Manning still has a lot to offer despite his 15 years in the league. He understands the game like few ever have and is one of the best QBs when it comes to reading coverages and checking out to a more productive play. He still has the kind of accuracy needed to complete passes but his arm strength is somewhat lacking when it comes to intermediate and deep balls. He can, however, will his team to victory by sheer force -- and is not one to take two consecutive losses lightly.

• Away QB: Last week Palmer led the Raiders to their first victory with a nice come-from-behind win off of three scoring drives in the final quarter. He is a classic pocket passer who can dissect a defense when given time in the pocket; however, he struggles when pressured or forced to make plays out on the perimeter. He has a very strong arm and can make all of the necessary throws while being able to read coverages and go through his progressions. He also does an excellent job of distributing the ball to his receivers and is quick to pull the trigger. On the downside, he sometimes forces deeper passes in situations where he could take the easy check-down pass.

• Key positional battle -- Raiders' secondary vs. Broncos' receiving corps: The Raiders' secondary has struggled when it comes to coverage this year and has yet to come up with an interception through three games. If Denver's receivers manage to get free on a consistent basis, Manning can surgically dissect the defense. Just how well the Raiders are able to disrupt the Broncos' receivers on their releases will play a major role in determining whether Manning connects with them.

• Featured player: Palmer is likely to be without his favorite receiver, Darrius Heyward-Bey, after he was knocked out of the Pittsburgh game in the fourth quarter. If he is gone, it is even more imperative that the Raiders come up with a strong running attack. McFadden is one of the most dynamic ball carriers in the league and a quick start from him this weekend would give the Raiders a much better chance of staying in this game. He not only can move the chains but also can help to keep the ball out of the hands of Manning and his explosive offense.

• Film room nuggets: Denver receiver Demaryius Thomas is getting more looks by Manning but is still a bit inconsistent when it comes to running precise routes and coming down with the ball when challenged. However, he can be a dynamic game-changing receiver once he gets the ball into his hands because of his speed in the open field. ... Running back Willis McGahee is widely recognized as a dynamic runner but he should get as much credit as a pass-blocker given his ability to pick up the blitz. There are few things that Manning appreciates more than a back who will consistently pick up the free blitzer. ... Oakland TE Brandon Myers has developed into a quality starting option. He runs excellent routes and has soft, sure hands that catch pretty much everything they touch.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_10p3mg,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/10p3mg/my_brother_has_espn_insider_and_they_publish/,

1357875842.0,31,self.DenverBroncos,16cxb7,ESPN Insider - Do Broncos have any weaknesses? ,agobayer,33,2,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/16cxb7/espn_insider_do_broncos_have_any_weaknesses/,"*Quick note: I love that this is the title of the article*

It is often said that football is a game of matchups. But it may be more accurate to say that football is a game of strengths and weaknesses. Coaches examine all the matchups to figure out where they have an advantage, then try to attack the opponent's weaknesses through certain plays or tendencies.

That presents a real problem for the Baltimore Ravens as they enter Saturday's divisional-round contest against the Denver Broncos. The Broncos are an extremely well-rounded team without a lot of glaring weaknesses. They finished in the top five of Football Outsiders' ratings for both offense and defense.

Do they have any weaknesses that Baltimore can exploit?

The short answer is no. In fact, even some positions that would have been seen as weaknesses a few months ago haven't been a problem recently for Denver. For example, Football Outsiders wrote before the season that free-agent acquisition Tracy Porter had very poor stats as a cornerback in New Orleans and would be a weak link in the Broncos' pass defense. However, Porter came down with an illness in mid-October, left the lineup and ended up demoted when Chris Harris and Tony Carter were clearly better. He's now the fourth corner and won't see the field much, especially against a Ravens team that rarely puts out four-wide sets.

Insider PickCenter
Wondering which side to take? Check out PickCenter and do your research before making that critical decision. PickCenter 

In preparation for this game, we combed through all the Football Outsiders stats looking for Denver's flaws. However, when we did find places where the Broncos were weak, the Ravens were usually weak as well.

For example, Denver has a tendency to start slowly: The Broncos rank 12th in offensive DVOA in the first quarter. (DVOA, FO's main system for rating teams and players, is explained here.) However, the Baltimore defense isn't particularly good in the first quarter either, ranking 22nd.

As you might expect from a team that depends on Peyton Manning, the Denver offense is much better passing the ball than running the ball. The Broncos rank second in our ratings for passing, 15th for rushing. But when they really, really need to run for just a yard or two, the Broncos get it more often than not. Denver converted 67 percent of runs in ""power"" situations (third down, fourth down or goal line with 1-2 yards to go), which ranks ninth in the league. Meanwhile, the Baltimore defense, which has been great against the run for over a decade, slipped badly in 2012 and was just 26th in our rankings. The Ravens were also awful in those short-yardage situations, allowing opponents to convert 76 percent of the time.

On defense, the Broncos have had a lot of trouble stopping opponents in the red zone. Though they rank fifth in our defensive ratings overall, they are 19th in the red zone, including 27th against red zone passing. However, the Ravens' offense also ranks just 19th in the red zone and is 28th on red zone passes.

Our Adjusted Line Yards statistic, which measures how well teams block or stop runs in different directions, shows that the Broncos have trouble stopping runs to the left. However, the Ravens are better running up the middle or to the right than they are running left.

Baltimore does have a clear advantage over Denver on special teams, but this doesn't really qualify as ""attacking a weakness."" The Ravens led FO's special teams ratings this season, while Denver was 13th. The Broncos were 25th in punt return value, but the negative value is almost all veteran Jim Leonhard; if Trindon Holliday's ankle is healthy enough for him to go, punt returns should be fine. And the Broncos ranked just 26th in FG/XP value, as Matt Prater was just 8-of-13 on field goal attempts over 40 yards despite kicking half the time in high altitude. Of course, in order to force Prater into a long field goal, the Ravens have to stop Manning first.

After going through all the trends and tendencies, we really found just two obvious examples where Denver weaknesses match up with Baltimore strengths. First, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information data, Manning was surprisingly weak this season against big blitzes of six or more. Manning had only 5.2 yards per play against big blitzes, compared to 7.9 yards per play the rest of the time. Only Blaine Gabbert was big-blitzed a higher percentage of the time than Manning, who faced six or more on 10 percent of pass plays. He was also poor against defensive back blitzes, averaging just 5.3 yards per play.

Second, like a doughnut, the only clear hole in the Denver defense is right in the center. An injury to Joe Mays forced 37-year-old veteran Keith Brooking into the lineup at middle linebacker. Brooking wasn't very good in pass coverage as a 30-year-old Pro Bowler in Atlanta, and he's even worse now. The Broncos ranked just 24th covering tight ends this season, with players like Jermaine Gresham and Greg Olsen burning Brooking for season-high 100-yard games.

These specific matchups were bright spots for Baltimore when it played Denver a month ago. The Ravens sent four big blitzes, and Manning completed just 1 of 3 passes, with a 7-yard sack. They blitzed a defensive back five times, and while Manning completed three of those five passes, the Broncos gained only 16 yards, with no first downs. Meanwhile, Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta caught 7 of 10 pass targets for 125 yards and two touchdowns.

And yet despite doing a good job of attacking these specific Broncos weaknesses, the Ravens lost 34-17 in a game that was only that close because Pitta scored both his touchdowns in the fourth quarter.

In other words, Baltimore is going to need to play a near perfect game to beat Denver on Saturday.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_16cxb7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/16cxb7/espn_insider_do_broncos_have_any_weaknesses/,

With the playoffs set to begin, they are back (along with Ron Jaworski) to give their selections for conference champions and a Super Bowl winner.*

**NFC Champion**

* Bill Polian: Atlanta Falcons  
I picked the Falcons at the start of the season and I see no reason to change up now. Atlanta has a complete team and, while the Niners are a great team as well, I think the Falcons will have just enough of a home-field advantage to claim the NFC. Everyone likes to clamor about how Matt Ryan and the Falcons haven't performed in the playoffs and don't have a great track record there. Those people need to realize. No one has success until they have success. Believe me when I say that past letdowns don't determine the future. I think we'll see the Falcons in New Orleans.

 
* Herm Edwards: San Francisco 49ers  
Colin Kaepernick should be able to do enough with his arm (and his legs) to cause some problems for opposing defenses. San Francisco's defense hasn't been as sharp in recent weeks, but it's one of the NFL's best units and the bye week will help them get healthy. This team can also win on the road in Atlanta if necessary.


* Ron Jaworski: 49ers  
The Niners are just a solid football team. If they have to go to Atlanta, I'm confident they can win there. My concern is Justin Smith's health. They're not nearly as good defensively when he's not on field. When he's in the lineup, Aldon Smith is much better, the rest of defensive line is much better … it just trickles down to the rest of the defense. You don't often talk about the impact of a defensive lineman, but Justin Smith has that kind of impact on his team.


* Mel Kiper: Falcons  
Finally. Yes, I know the Falcons have looked bad in this position before, and I know they had way too many close calls against questionable competition during the regular season. I still think that Ryan can carry them on offense and with Julio Jones, Roddy White and Tony Gonzalez, they can create matchup problems against any defense in the league. This team has often played down to the level of competition, but I view them as a very good ""best day"" team when the offense is clicking. They also have balance as the NFL's seventh-highest scoring offense and fifth-highest scoring defense. I think they get by San Fran to reach a Super Bowl for the first time since Dan Reeves was on the sideline.

**AFC Champion**

* Polian: Denver Broncos  
I picked Baltimore at the start of the season, but I believe the injuries have taken too much out of them at this point. There is no perfect team in the AFC, as each of these teams is flawed in one form or another. As such, I'll go with my heart and take Denver. Playoff success usually comes down to team health and an ability to exploit matchup advantages. The Broncos are mostly healthy and Peyton Manning can absolutely exploit any advantages that come his way. Now that New England has to go to Denver, I give the edge to the Broncos.


* Edwards: Broncos  
The Broncos are balanced and the hottest team in the NFL, earning a first-round bye with their Week 17 win. They have come together offensively under Manning and now have a top-10 defense as well. With Von Miller rushing the passer, I think this defense can do enough to slow down the elite AFC offenses in the postseason.


* Jaworski: New England Patriots  
We could talk about the offense all day long. The Patriots have every dimension you could possibly want. But I've started to see their defense play better, particularly against Miami in Week 17. Yes, that was against a non-playoff team, but the performance still showed me that the unit had improved since some of its early and mid-season struggles. Aqib Talib has solidified their man coverage, Devin McCourty is playing well and their pass rush has gotten better. The Pats had a little clunker down in Jacksonville, but I think that was more of a mental lapse than a physical one. And it's one they won't suffer in the playoffs.


* Kiper: Patriots  
The Patriots offense has, for the entire season, basically had one bad day. In Week 2, the offense was a bit of a dud against Arizona and scored just 18 points. Even then, they left a bunch of points on the field. Other than that, this is a team that scored 23 or more points in every game and averaged 34.8 points per game. That's pretty significant, because it's even more than the unstoppable 2007 Patriots scored. Even when Rob Gronkowski was out, they kept humming along. This team blocks, they can run on you and Tom Brady looks as comfortable as ever. But that's just half of it. The New England defense is seen as a liability, but they allowed the ninth-fewest amount of points in the league and have improved the pass rush a bit from last year. The addition of Talib and emergence of Alfonzo Dennard have helped the secondary. This is by no means a really good defense, but it's not a bad one. The Patriots were a Mario Manningham catch away from a Super Bowl win last year, and they're just a little better this year. I think they get past Denver to the Super Bowl.

**Super Bowl Champion**

* Polian: Broncos  
The difference between the two is very slight, one of the reasons I don't like making picks. I have to give the edge to Peyton under center. And if John Abraham is not healthy, I'd have to lean towards the Denver pass rush.


* Edwards: 49ers  
The key difference: The 49ers can run the ball well enough against Denver's defense to keep Manning off the field. On defense, San Francisco's pass rush should be able to get Manning off his spot and disrupt the timing of the Broncos offense. Denver is a more complete team, but I'm not sure the Broncos can run the ball well enough to win this game. I picked San Francisco to win it all before the season and I think they get it done.


* Jaworski: 49ers  
This is a tough one. But if it was easy, we'd all be getting our picks right. I love what Kaepernick brings the 49ers. He's a lot like Russell Wilson and Robert Griffin III, and we've kind of forgotten what Kaepernick can do with his legs. But what has surprised me most is how proficient a passer he is. He's connecting well with Michael Crabtree, and Delanie Walker and Vernon Davis are matchup nightmares down the field. Plus, they have that violent running attack as well. It adds up to enough of an edge to get by the Pats.


* Kiper: Patriots   
This could be a high-scoring game, something like 31-28 or 34-31 (all three of Brady's Super Bowl wins have come by a field goal) because both teams should be able to effectively throw the ball. I just give an edge to the way New England should be able to game plan with so many options in mind. Wes Welker, Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez are just too much, and it takes an extremely coordinated effort to slow them. If New England gets to this point with all of those guys healthy, I think they have just enough to top the Falcons even if Atlanta plays really well.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_15wxv4,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/15wxv4/espn_insider_piece_experts_super_bowl_playoff/,

After watching film of both teams, Scouts Inc. breaks down key elements of the Week 12 Broncos-Chiefs matchup.


• Slow the game down: Kansas City needs to make this a slow game by sticking to the run and sustaining long, clock-eating drives. If the Chiefs get into a track meet with Peyton Manning and the Broncos, they will definitely struggle to keep it close. Look for the Chiefs to use the maximum time on the clock on each snap and do everything possible to keep the clock moving. If the Chiefs let the Broncos get an early lead and are forced to throw the ball to play catch-up, they will play into the hands of Denver's explosive edge rushers.

• Protect the edges: Kansas City has two explosive edge rushers -- outside linebackers Tamba Hali and Justin Houston -- and Manning is not the most elusive quarterback in the NFL. Look for Denver to do a lot of situational substituting to keep a back or tight end in to help protect the edge and give Manning more time in the pocket.

• Play from a lead: Everybody wants to score quickly, but against the Chiefs it is even more important. Kansas City lacks the kind of explosive passing game that would allow it to mount many comebacks, especially considering the quarterback situation. As soon as the Chiefs are forced to throw the ball, they are in trouble. Their line struggles to protect the pocket and none of their quarterbacks has shown the ability to take the team downfield on winning drives late in the game.

• Home QB: Kansas City has been struggling at quarterback. Both Matt Cassel and Brady Quinn have played, and neither has set himself apart. At best we are talking about a game-manager. These guys need to avoid making mistakes and hope the ground game and the defense keeps this game close.

• Away QB: Manning is the epitome of a game-changer. He is one of the best at checking out of a bad play and into a good one from the line of scrimmage, and he comes into each game prepared for virtually every possibility. He excels at reading coverages and is a pinpoint passer when he has time in the pocket. He has enough agility to buy time by stepping up in the pocket or sidestepping the rush but is most effective when throwing out of the pocket.

• Key positional battle -- Broncos' OTs vs. Chiefs' OLBs: The Chiefs generate a dynamic pass rush off the edge with outside linebackers Hali and Houston. They both bring an excellent combination of speed, athleticism and power, and they can use speed, counter moves or strength to collapse the pocket. Denver's tackles, Ryan Clady and Orlando Franklin, will have their hands full as they try to keep Manning upright.

• Case for the underdog: Hali and Houston have the potential to come up with game-changing plays for the Chiefs. They both have the speed to come off the edge and have developed strong counter moves when needed. They have the ability to transfer speed into power when needed. If the Chiefs hope to keep this game close, they need to find ways to get to Manning and throw him off his timing and rhythm.

• Film room nuggets: Manning has shown consistent improvement after a year-long layoff. He is looking as confident as ever, and although his arm strength may not be what it once was, it is plenty strong enough. ... Strong safety Eric Berry has been one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs this year. He is extremely mobile and has a great nose for the ball. It looks like he has returned to full strength after missing the 2011 season with a knee injury.


Prediction


**Denver 30**

Kansas City 17	

Denver's defense should dominate a struggling Kansas City offense.

1350012557.0,31,self.DenverBroncos,11ck2v,Broncos-chargers ESPN Scouting Report,agobayer,32,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/11ck2v/broncoschargers_espn_scouting_report/,"After watching film of both teams, Scouts Inc. breaks down key elements of the Week 6 Broncos-Chargers matchup.


• Broncos still a work in progress: This Peyton Manning-led offense gets better each week as it improves chemistry, and the same thing goes for Denver's defense. There is not a deep element to Denver's passing game and all of Manning's routes are short to intermediate with a lot of bubble screens designed to get yards after catch. When the run game is going well, it sets up a nice play-action package. Defensively, the Broncos show a lot of pre-snap movement to confuse QBs and they are changing up their coverages on the back end. Chargers QB Philip Rivers will have to be very solid in his pre-snap reads. The Chargers will try to confuse Manning with some pre-snap movement and changing coverage looks of their own.

• This is not the Chargers' passing game we are used to seeing: In the past this has been a vertical passing attack with a lot of seam routes and big shots, but defenses are taking the deep ball away and Rivers is taking what the defense gives him. He is dumping off the ball to his backs, as Ryan Mathews and Ronnie Brown combined for 11 receptions and 106 yards versus New Orleans in Week 5. Before last Sunday, the Chargers were not getting a lot out of their edge passing game, but with Malcom Floyd playing well and Robert Meachem finally coming around, defenses have to honor those outside routes, and that opens up the middle, where TE Antonio Gates loves to work.

• Third down is a key: San Diego's offense is in the top third of the NFL in third-down conversions while Denver's defense is in the bottom third at getting off the field on third down, which was a huge problem in Week 5 at New England. The more San Diego can convert on third down to keep drives alive, the fewer possessions Manning will have. Rivers should continue to show patience and not force the deep ball on early downs, and if his run game is working, it will set up nice play-action opportunities, especially on third down. Denver's defense needs to be really good on first and second down to force Rivers into predictable third-and-long situations.

• Home QB: Rivers has terrific skills, and after a 2011 season in which he forced the ball, made bad decisions and tried to do too much, he is much more settled in 2012. He has excellent touch and accuracy and is terrific at recognizing defenses and reading his progressions. Denver defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio will use a lot of pre-snap movement to try to confuse Rivers and force some mistakes, but Rivers really works hard to prepare for a defense. This will be an interesting chess match between Del Rio and Rivers.

• Away QB: Manning is really starting to get into a groove with his receivers, and this timing pass offense is clicking. We don't see a lot of vertical throws and velocity on his passes, but he is very effective on short routes such as bubble screens, curls, outs, etc. He will work out of the shotgun at times with some no-huddle looks and will continue to make pre-snap adjustments to exploit the Chargers' defense. His receivers must be on the same page in sight adjustments. He will involve his backs and TEs in the passing game and is taking fewer chances than he was earlier in the season.

• Key positional battle -- San Diego OTs Jared Gaither and Jeromey Clary vs. Denver edge pass-rushers Von Miller and Elvis Dumervil: These offensive tackles have great size, but they do not match the athleticism of this Broncos edge pass-rush duo. Gaither and Clary are both wall-off guys with long wing spans and and good hands, but Dumervil and Miller will try to rush wide and get the slower OTs in space where they can also be beaten by double moves. Gaither hurt his groin versus New Orleans and was really struggling at the end of the game, so that is something to watch.

• Featured player: Mathews has had a roller-coaster 2012 season, partly because of injuries and partly because of a pattern of fumbles, but when he is in sync this offense has a totally different look. Although he has shared time with Jackie Battle and Brown, Mathews has much more explosiveness and big-play ability than the other two guys, both in the running and passing games. Denver has struggled to get off the field on third down and its gap discipline has been up and down. San Diego would love to control the flow of the game with a clock-eating run game to keep Manning and the Broncos' offense on the sideline.

• Film room nuggets: Miller earns his paycheck as a pass-rusher, but the coaches would like him to be a little more involved in coverage. So far he has been inconsistent in that area. … San Diego's defense is really thin at corner, which is not good news when you are getting ready to play Manning and his spread offense. … When you study Denver CB Champ Bailey on film you really start to appreciate his skill set. He has the physicality to cover a tight end, he can line up wide and take on the best wideout without help, he can play inside over the slot, and he can play man or zone. His instincts and ball skills are off the charts, and he can be effective as a blitzer.


Prediction
	San Diego 27
Denver 24	
Although Denver is getting better each week, the Chargers will steal this game with offensive balance and just enough of a run game to keep Peyton Manning off the field.

I knew they had been scouting him before the draft, and I watched his tape and I have to say he could be a great QB.

But the main feedback I'm seeing from everyone is ""We need to win now"". As in, if we don't win this year or next year, we fall into oblivion? Manning signed a 5 contract. Five years is a looonnnggg time folks. I'm not saying he'll play all 5, but even three years is a long time. Having to ""win now"" sounds desperate. Of course the Broncos want to win now, doesn't every team? I like that the Broncos not only want to win now, by signing Manning, but they also want to win down the road, by drafting what they think is a worthy predecessor. Not to mention, the backup quarterback position is very important. Ask the Colts from last year. Hell, ask Elway when Brister won 4 games for us in '98. If John Elway saw something in a young quarterback to draft him so he would learn quarterbacking by watching Peyton Manning, that's all I need to know.

What do you guys think?

If you have any questions or comments about the new layout, leave us feedback here. 

Some notes:

* **The header image will rotate.** Currently it is for training camp, once preseason starts it will be updated accordingly. Once the regular season starts, I hope to update week to week. 

* **The NFL logo in the header links back to /r/nfl** The NFL logo in the header is a link back to /r/nfl, when you hover over it, all the team logos will show and those link to other team subreddits. You can thank the mods at /r/seahawks for this. 

* **Flair is updated.** Previously, we didn't have the flair updated for the Jags, Dolphins and Vikes but now we do (not that you care). Also, for those of you with text flair, I'll need y'all to chose a flair, but not from the sidebar just let me know so I can update it. You flair text will still be there when hovering the image flair. 

There's probably some stuff I'm missing but please leave me feedback, both positive and negative, in the comments. Also, if you have questions or concerns, I'll be sure to address them in the comments.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,cubedG,True,t3_1jdc1b,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/1jdc1b/discussion_thread_updated_layout/,moderator

While that's something to celebrate, it means picking a defensive player of the year is extremely difficult. It means we have to go beyond the big box score numbers that are trumpeted by many as the deciding factors in a player's candidacy.

Let's run through the contenders, looking at pros and cons for each player:

**The Front-Runners: J.J. Watt and Von Miller**

Let me be clear: If these two aren't the first guys you're mentioning for this award, you aren't watching enough football. Break them down however you want; they're on another level right now.

Take Watt. He has 14 batted passes this season. We started PFF in 2008, and nobody has had more than 10 in a season. He also has a run stop percentage of 19 percent; the next best for a defensive lineman is 12.3 percent. Factor in his 55 combined sacks, hits and hurries this season, and you've got a true impact player who is almost unstoppable.

Still, Miller sees those 55 QB disruptions and raises him. Miller has 69 to lead our pass rushing productivity signature stat, and if that wasn't enough, he is tied with Watt with 13 tackles for loss (only Lavonte David has more). In Miller's rookie season, he was more of a pass-rushing specialist, but he's taken his game to another level, becoming a real every-down force and a worthy defensive player of the year.

**The Somewhat Overrated: Aldon Smith**

This is what happens when you look at what a player has done on 2.5 percent of his total snaps and decide he deserves an award because of it. Smith is having a good season, but just looking at his sack numbers shouldn't be enough to call him a defensive player of the year -- especially when those numbers include five that were either unblocked or of the cleanup variety.

Smith isn't the run defender Watt or Miller is and is only eighth in terms of the amount of pressure per play he was picked up. A good season? Yes. But he hasn't done enough outside of his sack total.

**The Dark Horse: Geno Atkins**

It's criminal how underrated Atkins is. He doesn't get the attention of Ndamukong Suh or have the champions Haloti Ngata does, but he makes plays. When he's finished making those plays, he gets up and makes more plays. It's what he does.

The most productive interior pass-rusher in the NFL, Atkins is putting up the kind of numbers you see from elite defensive ends. He has 58 quarterback disruptions and has generated a higher percentage of pressure than a guy such as Smith. That's scary good. More than just a one-trick pony, he also has 21 defensive stops in the run game (third-highest of all defensive tackles). He's a force, and then some.

**The Forced Fumble Machine: Charles Tillman**

What can you say about Tillman that hasn't already been said? Eight forced fumbles in a season is quite frankly ridiculous, especially when you consider that none has come from rushing the passer -- where it's often easier to knock a ball out of a quarterback's hands.

That's the definition of playmaking, and it's paired with some good work in coverage. Take how he was able to man up with Calvin Johnson in a manner few can aspire to. He's given up a decent 1.05 yards per snap in coverage, intercepting two balls and deflecting eight more -- add that up, and you've got a difference-maker. He's not at the Darrelle Revis level of cornerback play, but he's been extremely effective.

As with any of these awards, there's a huge degree of subjectivity and personal preference involved. But while Miller is having a season for the ages, Watt is redefining the position he plays.

He's that good, and that's why I'm endorsing him for defensive player of the year.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_14co4r,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/14co4r/espn_insider_breaking_down_the_dpoy_race_should/,

Even here on the West Coast, it looks like I'm about an hour and a half past my day.  Last two days have been pretty crazy.  Anyways, here you go:


**Player Summary**


The Broncos did not expect to be able to grab Sylvester Williams in the 2013 draft.  Said John Elway, “we had mocks all week, and he didn’t get to us in any of the mocks.  We were thrilled to see him fall to us, we had him very high on our boards.”[[1]]( http://www.denverbroncos.com/multimedia/videos/Elway-Fox-Break-Down-Day-1-of-Draft/01e2c523-5fdf-4d79-b748-d69268b2597b)   The unexpected fall of Shariff Floyd to the Vikings at 23 (when some analysts had predicted him as high as the top 10) gave the Broncos an opportunity to steal a talent perhaps above their pick number.

Sly’s road to the NFL has been a longer one than many first-round picks.  After quitting football in high school, he graduated and went to work at a manufacturing plant.  However, seeing players of his size playing at a college level inspired him to go to play at junior college.  He walked on to Coffeyville Community College, and after two seasons there he found himself fielding numerous calls from prestigious university football programs.  Williams decided on UNC, where he immediately started on an already impressive defensive line.

William’s greatest asset is his incredible physical strength.  He has the rare physical skills to push the pocket back and either disrupt runners before they make their cut or apply interior pressure to the quarterback.  If he is able to translate his impressive college contributions to the pro game, he will be a constant headache to opposing Offensive Line Coaches and OCs


**Stats and Notables**


Sylvester Williams has only two seasons of play in the ACC, as he played his first two seasons at community college

* 2011:  13 games, 54 tackles (23 solo), 7 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks
* 2012:  12 games, 42 tackles (21 solo), 13.5 tackles for loss, 6.0 sacks

http://www.cfbstats.com/2012/player/457/1040524/index.html


**How he will benefit the Broncos**


Did you guys watch the Sports Science on Williams???  Seriously.  [Here it is.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9GZz4l2Sxs)  Go watch, I’ll wait here . . .

Ok, did you see that?  6’3”, 323lbs, *33 inch thighs???*  10 yards in 2 seconds?  Accelerates to 14mph in two steps?  That’s straight-up ridiculous.

If Williams is able to mature into commanding double-teams (especially to aid smaller centers), it will free up an incredible amount of space for guys like Derek Wolfe and Shaun Phillips to pressure from other place on the line.  And of course, if a quarterback is forced to leave the pocket from pressure without a blitz, that just puts him right where Von can chase him down (unless he wants to put up hurried throws for Champ and Chris Harris to grab).  Although much talk this offseason has been concerning how to replace the pass rush we lost due to that [stupid fax machine]( http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-puppetconf-2012/images/office-space-printer-beat-down-gif.gif), no one said it had to come from the DE position.  Though a DT will never record sacks like a DE, quarterback hurries and tackles for loss have the same effect of making every other defense player on the field a little better.

Most criticisms of him surround the downsides of his incredible size.  First, critics note that his athleticism drops as he gets tired, always a problem with such large linemen.  However, with the signing of Terrance Knighton (who, amusingly, was cited by [nfl.com]( http://www.nfl.com/draft/2011/profiles/sylvester-williams?id=2539270) as Sly’s NFL comparison) the retention of Unrein and Vickerson, and the projected continued growth of Wolfe, Williams will probably not be expected to be a three-down player his first year.  Second, his size might it difficult for him to change directions to capture elusive quarterbacks or shifty runners once he reaches the backfield.  Sly will probably not be chasing down Cam Newton--fortunately, [we already have a guy that can do that.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ktt2fivInc)

In short, though he will not be the face of his defense any time soon (even if the defense didn’t feature Von Miller), he possesses the skills to fit into a formidable front-4 rotation that have turned one of our defense’s weakest aspects into perhaps one of its strengths.


**Final Thoughts**


Position players get all the hype, which is just the nature of the game.  I imagine that’s the reason that the press and even fans have been much more focused on the Broncos’ second-round selection of Montee Ball than our first-round pick of Williams.  However, I am incredibly excited to see #92 suit up in orange and start wreaking havoc as part of an impressive rotation on our defensive line.  If all goes according to plan, Sylvester Williams will be a rock in the center of our defensive front for years to come.

Champ Bailey was born and raised in Georgia, and was played football for the University of Georgia Bulldogs. It is often forgotten because of his massive professional accomplishments but Champ Bailey was a three way threat at Georgia, not only the top corner in college football, but a standout wide receiver and special teams threat as a kick returner. Champ Bailey became the first person in almost 40 years to start the same game on Offense and Defense. In 1997 not only did Charles Woodson take Peyton Manning's Heisman, he had an [arguably lesser season than Bailey did in 1998.](http://www.dawgsports.com/2012/7/16/3161736/georgia-bulldogs-champ-bailey-heisman-trophy-ea-sports-ncaa-football-13) Champ Bailey won the Bronco Nagurski award in 1998 as a Junior and the nation's #1 defender. He did this all while also being 10th in the SEC in receptions (47) and 6th in the SEC in receiving yards (744). In addition to the Nagurski award Champ was a consensus All American in 1998, and first team all SEC in 1997 and 1998.

In the 1999 NFL draft Champ Bailey was drafted as the 7th overall pick by the Washington Redskins. His impact was immediate, in his first preseason game he intercepted Drew Bledsoe and returned it for a touchdown, and thus began Bailey's reputation for shutting down one side of the field. He made his first Pro-Bowl and first All-Pro team during his second season and hasn't looked back since.

Just before the 2004 season Champ Bailey was traded to the Denver Broncos for Clinton Portis, a trade that many at the time believed Washington got the better end of the deal, hindsight shows us just how silly that was. Since being in Denver Champ has cemented himself as not only one of the best Broncos of all time, but one of the best cornerbacks the league has ever seen. Not only does he shut down his side of the field in the passing game with 34 interceptions as a Bronco (4th in franchise history), Champ has erased the preconception of cornerbacks being soft and shying away from contact he with 507 tackles in Blue and Orange (10th in franchise history). In the 2005 and 2006 seasons Champ had arguably the most dominant seasons by any cornerback in history. He intercepted 18 passes for 3 TDs, while amassing 134 tackles. He continued to get robbed of major awards and finished just second for Defensive Player of the Year. According to Ron Jaworski was only challenged 35 times for just 4 completions and 0 touchdowns. In 2009 Bailey was challenged just 80 times over the whole season and allowed zero touchdowns.

**Stats and Notables**

[Pro-Football-Reference: Champ Bailey](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BailCh00.htm)

* 52 Interceptions (26th all time)
* 12 Pro-Bowls - Most all time for CB position, tied for most all time of any position.
* 3 time First-team All-Pro (2004, 2005, 2006)
* 4 time Second-team All-Pro (2000, 2003, 2007, 2012)
* 2 time Defensive Back of the year (2005, 2006)

**How he will benefit The Broncos**

Champ isn't the same player as he was 7-8 years ago, but at the same time he is still near to if not at the very top of the NFL's Cornerback rankings. He consistently defends the opposing team's #1 receiver, often times left alone on an island. This allows the safeties and other players to cheat a bit to the other side of the field improving the defense across the board. Champ still has top end speed, as well as incredible agility. Players will often mention his hips as a key to making defensive plays, Champ can adjust his body plant and change direction better than most players 10 years his junior. This allows him to stay close to quick receivers underneath and keep up with speedier receivers on double moves and deep bombs on the outside. Corners are often thought of as receivers who can't catch, this is entirely untrue for Champ. His ball skills and ability to snag a pass are also an elite skill that few players at his position can match. This is possibly due to the extended time and reps he received at Georgia playing wide receiver. 

Champ's ability to shut down receivers is well known and appreciated, however his tackling prowess is often under-appreciated. Not only does Champ make the safeties' jobs easier, he does so for the linebackers as well. When a runningback swings outside to the flats Champ has the ability to make consistent tackles in one on one situations, often against bigger players. If you watch most corners they will often tackle by dragging down or holding on for dear life until a linebacker can come in and finish the job, not with Champ. He has great tackling technique, always placing his facemask straight ahead, wrapping the legs up and driving the ball carrier backwards. This skill and ability is almost unheard of for the corner position. Calling him a crutch for the front 7 would be unfair to the rest of our defense, but at the same time he has the ability to bail out missed assignments and missed tackles which is a luxury any team in the league would love to have.

**Final Thoughts**

Champs critics will say at 35 he has slowed down, can't keep up with the fastest receivers in the league (ie Torrey Smith) and doesn't produce like he used to. While all this may be true, take his current ability into context with the rest of the league he is still an elite corner. In addition Broncos fans should truly appreciate his dedication and commitment to the franchise, in 2010 the Broncos went 4-12 and were absolutely decimated talent wise by Josh McDaniels. Going into the 2011 season with Tim Tebow as starting QB we had virtually no hope on the horizon, Bailey was a free agent and at 33 years old nobody would have blamed him for chasing a Super-Bowl with a contender. He could have gone anywhere and started and helped a team make a run at a superbowl, but instead he stayed committed to the organization and us the fans. Without Bailey there is no way our defense makes the incredible turn around it did in 2011 and I'm willing to bet PFM never comes to Denver. He is without a doubt the most important player this franchise has had since Elway and Terrell Davis.

Champ Bailey's career will always have doubters based on his relatively low number of interceptions, but these people don't realize how he dominates the game. He can't intercept a pass when the QB refuses to throw in his direction. He has the immense respect of teammates and just as importantly, his opponents. It's been a privilege to be a Broncos fan and watch the greatest corner in NFL history dominate the sport for the last decade.

I'm a long time fan and I'm (finally!) going to my first Broncos game. I convinced my wife this is the year and we just bought tickets through NFL ticket exchange (Section 105) to the season opener against Baltimore on Sept 5th. 

To say I'm jacked up right now would be a massive understatement!!!

I've never been to a game before (or Denver for that matter!) and I'd appreciate any suggestions you may have to help me get the most out of the experience! My wife and I are out of towners, we'll be flying in from central Canada (Winnipeg, Manitoba).

Any and all recommendations you may have is greatly appreciated.

My head is spinning still but here are a few random thoughts that come to mind:

- How long of a drive is it from airport to the stadium with game-day traffic ?
- Decent hotel close to the stadium ?
- Not so nice areas to stay away from ?
- What is the earliest we can get into the stadium ?
- Any must see places (either in the stadium or close by) ?
- Chants besides IN-COM-PLETE ? ;)
- Is it September yet ?
- Seriously is it September yet ?

Looking forward to your suggestions!

Point blank he fucked up huge. Like, Bill Buckner huge. He's had spotty coverage all year, but as others have pointed out, our outstanding Dline pressure has masked how vulnerable our secondary has been. While the loss comes down on more than one person (see also Champ, PFM, Prater, Fox, Refs, etc), Rahim fucked up. Prevent defense has never been so jacked up. Its on Rahim.

Rahim knows it. Go look at how many people have posted on twitter he needs to kill himself. Ya, it sucks to have lost in such a large, marvelous screw up. If anything comes from this though, I've gained a bit of respect for Moore. Theres a lack of people taking responsibility in professional sports as a whole, but Rahim Moore sat there last night, took full blame, and manned up and let everyone know that his failure led to the team's failure. You dont see that kind of attitude enough in the league, and its huge. 

Whatever happens from here out with him, whether he stays or goes, you know this mistake will never leave him. He's hurting, but manning (no put intended) up and taking the blame, and becoming a better player from it. It's hard to swallow, but I have much more respect for a player who screws up and has the character and professionalism to realize his mistake, then some scumbag who makes that play but is nowhere near as professional in his actions.

The Houston Texans may still have the best record in the AFC, but it hasn't been smooth sailing for them over the past month and a half. They started out 8-1, with mostly convincing victories except for their one loss to the Green Bay Packers. But their 4-2 record since then masks how much they are struggling, as two of those wins came in overtime to Jacksonville and Detroit teams that are a combined 6-24.

The Texans' best win during this recent string may have been two weeks ago, when they clinched their division by beating Indianapolis 29-17. With nothing to play for but pride in front of their home fans, how can the Colts reverse those results and deny the Texans a top-two seed and a first-round bye?


Of course, the biggest story around this game has nothing to do with either X's and O's or advanced stats. This game represents Chuck Pagano's return to the sidelines after missing three months fighting leukemia. As I have often written, intangibles are called intangibles because they are intangible. That doesn't mean they don't exist. We can't find any number that represents how Pagano's return might affect the motivation of his players, but it is a reasonable assumption that the Colts will take the field with a little extra fire in their bellies to go with the usual home-field advantage.

Of course, a little extra fire won't do much if they can't figure out a way to block J.J. Watt and cover Andre Johnson.

The latter is a bigger problem than the former, because the Colts' defense is very bad. It's a lot worse than their ""official"" NFL ranking of 26th in yards allowed, because the Colts have played the easiest schedule of opposing offenses in the league, and they have managed to take away the ball with a turnover on just 6.5 percent of drives, the worst figure in the league. That all combines to rank the Colts dead last in our defensive ratings. The Colts are last against the run, next-to-last against the pass and they rank 27th or lower on first, second and third down. Their biggest defensive strength is preventing passes to running backs (they rank fourth) but that won't help much since the Texans don't pass to the running backs as much as they used to.

Yet as bad as the Colts defense is, the Texans offense hasn't been much better over the last few weeks. Through the first nine weeks, the Texans ranked fourth in passing DVOA and 11th rushing; since Week 10, they rank 21st in passing and 24th in rushing. Wide receivers other than Johnson are mostly absent from the passing game; Kevin Walter has a catch rate of just 60 percent, his lowest since 2007; and Texans running backs have been stuffed for a loss or no gain 21 percent of the time (23rd in the NFL). However, Colts defenders have been so poor at tackling running backs in the open field that Arian Foster is bound to get a couple of highlight-level runs.

Indy's best bet to keep its defense off the field is to keep its offense on, and the Colts have been doing a good job of that. The Colts tend to start drives in bad field position because they are so poor on defense and on kick returns, but they make up for that with lots of yards. The Colts' average drive starts 76.1 yards away from a touchdown (31st in the NFL) but averages 35.6 yards (second in the NFL). They get those yards with a lot of third-down conversions, as the Colts rank 25th in DVOA on first down and 21st on second down, but ninth on third down. Indianapolis has been strong on the ground on third down, second in DVOA behind New England, while Andrew Luck is particularly good at converting tough third-and-long situations. Luck has converted a league-leading 39 percent of the time on third or fourth down with 7-plus yards to go. (The league average, and Matt Schaub's rate, is 28 percent.)

It won't help that the Texans have trouble getting to the quarterback on third downs. On first and second down, the Texans have an Adjusted Sack Rate of 8.8 percent, fourth in the league. On third and fourth down, that is cut in half to 4.4 percent, which is 25th.

Whom will Luck connect with when he makes the big play? Well, the Texans have done a good job of concentrating their defense on the opponent's top receiver, but that leaves them susceptible to whoever is on the other side. The Texans rank fifth in the league against the opposing team's top wideout, but 28th against No. 2s. We saw this trend when these teams played a couple of weeks ago, as Reggie Wayne had just three catches for 14 yards, while T.Y. Hilton had three catches for 78 yards and a touchdown.

**Cover Watch: Arizona (plus-16.5) at San Francisco**

Are you ready for the Brian Hoyer Show? Yes, the Arizona quarterback situation has been pathetic this year, and it isn't going to get much better against the 49ers. But remember when the Cardinals were 4-0 and we were all praising their defense? All this offensive impotence has hidden the fact that the Cardinals' defense has stayed strong all season, especially against the pass. DVOA ranks them second, behind only Chicago. However, their run defense ranks 20th, which is a problem against a 49ers team that likes to keep it on the ground. If the Cardinals fall behind, the 49ers will go into a very effective clock-killing mode, so Arizona needs to keep it close from the start.

The trick may be to send as much pressure as possible, trying to force the 49ers to leave Vernon Davis in to block. The weakness of the Cardinals defense has been covering tight ends, where they rank 18th in DVOA. Otherwise, this has been a lockdown pass defense led by Patrick Peterson; no defense is stronger against passes to the right side. That's important because both Colin Kaepernick and Alex Smith have been best passing to their right. On right-side passes at least 10 yards past the line of scrimmage, the average NFL quarterback has completed 44 percent for 9.9 yards per play and Kaepernick has completed 65 percent for 14.8 yards per play. But Arizona opponents have completed just 37 percent for 8.0 yards per play.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,True,t3_15j2pf,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/15j2pf/espn_insider_upset_watch_colts_texans_or_why_the/,
