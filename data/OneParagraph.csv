But the real excitement is the special edition challenge featuring Roy Kelly, aka Yeah_Ill_Read_That!! If you're not familiar with Roy/YIRT, he does amazing voice acts of reddit posts. [Here is a past post he has done of the top 1p submission of alll time!](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/o5yip/wandering_in_the_snow/c3ewmw5)

For challenge [2.16]...

Write ANYTHING that you think would sound fantastic read by an amazing voice actor. Write a monologue, write a scene description, write dialogue, write whatever. The emphasis for this challenge is lyrical quality. Are you the next speech writer for the president, or the next Tarantino with your engaging dialogue? Prove it!

(A caveat: Because Roy/YIRT is male he is much more comfortable reading male voices. If you include more than one POV in your 1P, be sure that there is no more than a single female voice. More than one male voices are acceptable.This isn't because we are sexist here or anything, it's only a limitation to try and make YIRT's performance more feasible and spectacular. Thanks for understanding!)

**For participants new to 1P or just reddit in general, here's some help:**

**To Enter**: Scroll down a little and click ""submit a link."" Just paste your one paragraph story in and give it a title, but in front of the title put [2.16]. That's how you tell the moderators that you want your story considered part of the contest.

**To vote for entries**: In the search field on the right side of this page, type in [2.16], making sure to keep ""limit my search to r/oneparagraph"" checked. All results starting with that 2.16 in brackets are submissions for this week's contest. You can go through them and upvote as many stories as you want.

EDIT: Clarity thanks to waltfellows

EDIT: Added instructions for Roy's youtube subscribers following his link and who wish to participate in the contest.

The effect was so subtle that most didn't give it a second thought, yet the vague, observable memory lingered just long enough to be recorded. In all the time since the birth of stars, the Observer had never witnessed such an effect, and was at a complete loss for an explanation.

Hey, so of course we’re meant to start out with pleasantries since that’s what normal people do (hello, how are you etc…) but why don’t we skip that since they’re so boring and pointless. And then we should probably talk about our jobs, where we went to school, how many brothers and sisters we have, and perhaps ascertain if we have mutual tastes in food and literature. It is even possible that we will have different tastes, but that our disagreement about this will be comical, rather than unpleasant. And then, as the evening wears on, after we feel the glow of several beers, we might start to smile more, relax a bit, and then our minds will go crazy, ridiculous fantasies of beach-front weddings, lounging in the park on Sundays as our kids run around on the grass, giggling and chasing butterflies. And then when the check comes, our hands will brush, and our hearts will melt. But of course for all of that to happen, I would have to message you. And since I am a scared man, sitting amidst the filth of his apartment, staring at your okcupid profile like a lecherous sociopath, perhaps I should simply leave you alone. Let you meet the man who might actually make this fantasy come true. Not the man whose pathetic, desperate messages you ignore with only a slight twinge of guilt, and who you mock, kindly, to your girlfriends over your Thursday night margaritas.

Parents create safe cocoons and we hate them for it. The mugs of hot chocolate steaming on the kitchen table as we stumble back from playing in the snow. The hand placed gently on our back as we sit engrossed in our favorite novel. The overabundance of Christmas presents with the crinkly wrapping paper. The fresh-smelling new books that we glance at before relegating to a forgotten pile in our bedroom. The endless rides, the never-ending ferrying between this and that play-date, match, concert, after school activity. And we hate them and hate them and hate them and hate them. And blame them for everything. And watch their acid-tongued exchanges when they forget that we are listening, their scathing withering remarks, even as, with the same breath, they tousle your hair and tell you you’re so special. They create the most wonderful, magical, impermeable of cocoons and we cannot help hating them for it.

[TALK],turtlestack,16,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/jsmrb/creating_a_strong_character_without_them_ever/,"First, please watch this video by Johnny Cash called [Five Feet High And Rising](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fpbCLNyPUA).

This song is possibly one of the greatest examples of elegantly creating a character, the papa, even though he never speaks a word in the entire song. The mother does all the explaining to the kid - she answers when the kid asks her how high the water is and again when the kid asks papa. 

Yet you can just feel papa's presence through every single note of this song. His silence is much more powerful than if he had any lines. You know he's feeling desperate at the loss due to the flood, but you also get the impression that he's a stoic man, never one to complain but always one to worry. Momma does all the talking for him because she knows how bad things are and she's trying to keep the family together. 

When Cash wrote this, he obviously made the deliberate choice to always say ""**She** said it's X feet high and rising"" no matter who the kid is asking the question to. Cash wanted to paint a picture of the typical strong, worried and silent male farmer. And he did it without giving papa anything to say or having the mother or kid describe what the father looked like, or any description of the father at all.

This is a great example of storytelling. Even though it's a song, it still applies to storytelling, especially here in 1P since we have such limited space to create a character. In just 2 min, Cash created two real, vivid characters, the setting of a farm, flood and family. He used very natural language and stayed true to how these characters would respond given the circumstances. Cash doesn't cheat us, the listener, and he doesn't try to overdo it with too much exposition or description.

Now, granted, this is not everyone's style of writing, nor am I trying to imply how I think anyone here should write. I just wanted to point out how a simple, elegant choice created a vivid character with very limited space.",,False,,t5_2rkb7,False,,,True,t3_jsmrb,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/jsmrb/creating_a_strong_character_without_them_ever/,

Others cite the all round terrible year that was '61, when no ship found harbour in a stormy sea. But these are meager hints.

Let me guess. In social situations you always feel slightly out of place. You can’t quite engage with what’s going on around you, you can’t participate in the relaxed, joyful mirth that comes so easily to your companions in the bar or restaurant. You only truly feel yourself when reading books or by yourself. You have a job that pays the bills but you feel that there’s something missing, that a special relationship or a change in career will make you happier, make you more fulfilled, give your life a greater sense of meaning. “If only I had made better decisions when I was younger,”  you think, “I would be truly happy.” Maybe you spend a few minutes sitting on your couch staring at the ground, mulling over your life choices. You make some attempts to change. Learn an instrument, try to write a novel, but somehow life moves along about the same as it always has. You realize that all the wild fantasies you had as a high schooler and college student will never come true. You resign yourself to a certain amount of boredom, unpleasantness and pain, so long as you are safe, and have enough people around you to keep from being lonely. Occasionally you still get carried away with wild fantasies (successful novelist, award winning teacher, late-blooming professional musician). But now when the fantasies subside you don’t cry.

I wonder what will really happen, if we really will be devastated, if a giant tree limb will come crashing through my window, if I’ll be huddled in the apartment reading books by cande-light, eating black beans directly out of the can. I watch the frenzied shoppers, the harried cashiers screaming for the manager to void an item, the desolated shelves filled with stray, undesirable items like potato bread and strawberry/kiwi scented candles.

As we departed from electricity, our bodies easily fell ill, and we bled out the machines while facing dangers we've never encountered. Slowly, animals traveled back as weeds and bushes sprouted. Insects resurfaced after centuries of silent absence. We finally freed ourselves when the last neon spotlight went dark. Then, we found a beautiful resolution.

Five minutes to write something. Anything. I’m jittery. My heart is pounding. It was a crazy night, running from goblins, hiding under an enormous rock while horses' hoofs pounded overhead. At one point, a great eagle swooped down and beckoned that I climb aboard. I clutched his downy feathers and we soared into the sky. When he dropped me off in the middle of the Evermore forest (towering trees that smell of soft, damp earth), I walked for six hours until my feet bled. And now I am where I am now. Scribbling these words with a quill pen on one of my few remaining scraps of paper. The poor villager who took pity on my dozes by the fire in this squallid little hovel that smells of fish and wet wool. I will rise before he wakes and tip toe out into the forest. I have a six hour head start on the goblins. And the whispering in the leaves tell me that Clora, the love of my life, the fire that ignites my soul, is shivering in a cave just a day’s journey away, tracing my name endlessly on the rough stone walls.

**Challenge [2.33]: Conspiracy**

So,

This week I discovered a subreddit called /r/hailcorporate. It's pretty interesting. Basically it's devoted to calling out posts that seem like they could be viral marketing by companies. It's all pretty conspiratorial, and that got me thinking.

How about some stories about conspiracies?!

They could be anything. 

Two kids plotting a water balloon fight? That's a conspiracy

Plot to destroy the world's largest tire to collect insurance money? Conspiracy

Covert military operation gon awry deep in enemy territory? Conspiracy

There's a lot you can do with the concept of a conspiracy, so go wild!

When I was a child I covered my bedroom walls with pictures from Sports llustrated. I would spend hours staring at them and dreaming of when I myself would stand in front of a roaring crowd, rocket a long fly ball to deep centerfield, and hear the thunderous ovation of 50,000 delirious fans. In middle school, it dawned on me that a bench warmer on his senior league baseball team would probably never make the Major Leagues. So my ambitions shifted to something more modest: professional tennis player. Fewer people played tennis (so it seemed to me) so that would give me a better shot. For six weeks after school, I placed my $25 kmart tennis racket and some squishy balls from a yard sale in my backpack and biked across the campus of the local university to hit balls against the side of a quasi-deserted building. On the way I passed actual tennis courts which had been long since abandoned, the green surface a spider web of cracks, filled with tufts of grass. No matter, in a few years, I would be stalking the pristine lawns of Wimbledon. Trying to encourage my interest, my parents paid for tennis lessons from a middle-aged man from our church. The first lesson was horrific. Despite my hours of solitary practice, I was incapable of returning a single shot that the instructor gently lobbed in my direction. After spraying hundreds of balls into the net, over the fence, and into the adjacent courts, the lesson ended and I ran home sobbing. That night I tore down every single picture on my wall and started working furiously on a novel about that day’s disappointment, stopping periodically to imagine what picture would be on the cover and how many weeks it would stay on the New York Times best-seller list.

You correct people with knowledge you just googled. You use big words and scientific jargon and try as hard as you can to sound intellectual. You know you aren't as smart as you portray yourself, but you do it anyway because you can't process in your mind that this behavior is a sad and pathetic fraud. Deep down you want to be validated, but it doesn't cross your mind that everything you do is a lie...an insignificant lie.

Did it involve a sensation so intense that your life was changed forever, and that for the rest of your days you glided through the world with cool confidence? No, no, no, it couldn’t be so. Surely for most people, it’s a flash of pleasure bookended by trembling hands, and apocalyptic thoughts of pregnancy and wasting away from AIDS. He couldn’t be the only one.

The only way you get good is if you try, if you learn, and you keep writing.

**The Week 3 Challenge**

[2.3]

""Itch Once Scratched""

This idea come from redditor [waltfellows](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/y494q/new_challenge_idea_submissions_generation_2/).

What happens when one finally takes the plunge to satisfy a temptation - was it worth it?

I want to see stories about that exact thing. We've all been there. These are feelings worth exploring because more often than not we never get satisfied in the way we wanted to be. Many times caving in to temptation takes us somewhere other than we thought it could. It takes us to places that we didn't know existed. It takes us to places that elate us, annoy us, or make us reget that our temptation ever existed. 

Take us to that place of ""So that's what it's like.""

1344216422.0,10,self.OneParagraph,xqodp,ANNOUNCEMENT: Hello from two new mods and bringing back the weekly challenge [2.1]. ,jmn357,14,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/xqodp/announcement_hello_from_two_new_mods_and_bringing/,"**Hey there /r/OneParagraph,**

We're jmn357 and lucidenigma and we're two new mods here. We're just getting settled in and figuring things out. In the coming weeks we're looking to reinvigorate the subreddit.

First though, let's have some introductions:

**jmn357:** 

Hey ya'll

I've been a redditor for over three years and have been a long time submitter to /r/OneParagraph. It's one of my favorite Reddit writing communities. I work full time, but I plan to devote my free time on Reddit to make this a better community.

Why mod /r/OneParagraph?

It's always been a place for me to hone specific ideas. Flash-fiction like this is a skill that makes you a better writer, a more focussed story teller, and exercises your endurance. 

As a writer I've always found it easiest to write about relationships (of all types). The simplicity of interaction is one of my favorite things to explore. As far as influences my greatest would have to be Haruki Murakami.

 

**lucidenigma:**

Hello everyone,

I'm one of the two new mods and extremely excited to spruce up this subreddit. I've been a redditor for about a year and a half now and only recently have I become involved with writing communities such as this one. I'm a college student in Cambridge so I'll have ample free time to devote to /r/oneparagraph.

I decided to join this subreddit because I believe the first step in becoming a great writer is building a sound foundation. Mastering the art of filling a single paragraph with depth is an essential part of this process. As a philosophy concentrator I love the psychological and sub-conscious struggles characters have and it is what I enjoy writing about. Authors like Faulkner and Hemingway have distinctly impacted my style in this way.

Anyways, I hope to improve this community for all the current members and try to expand it as well! Keep writing!

**We also need some help from you:** 

What we're asking for first is someone who is a CSS wizard to help make a new theme for the subreddit. I think we're edging towards a cleaner, simpler design: something that reflects the brevity and the simplicity of the material submitted here. Please message the moderators if you are the person for the job, know someone who can do it, or have seen a design you like.

We also want you to be active! 

Submit! 

Comment! 

And don't be afraid to crosspost something you post here somewhere else if it's relevant. We're looking to get traffic up a bit so more people can see the quality writing that's here, and so we can all enjoys writers that haven't submitted here yet because they don't know the subreddit exists. 

**New Challenges:**

We will backlog the first generation of weekly challenges on the sidebar. Because it's been so long since one was posted, we've decided to break the challenges up. The new ones will be part of a second generation. As such, when submitting your challenges on the main /r/oneparagraph page you should number the challenge accordingly. 

It should look something like this:

""[2.1] The title""

Now...

The actual challenge.

**[2.1]: Retail**

Retail: 

Many of us have had crappy retail jobs. You know the one, when you were in high school and you spent all summer as a cashier dealing with little old ladies trying to use coupons that expired during the first Clinton administration. Maybe you worked in a mall, or in the stockroom of a store. Maybe you've never worked retail, but you've all been to stores and had experiences in them. Some are good, some bad, and sometimes you have experiences you weren't expecting when you made that run to get AA batteries for your remote.

So, we're looking for stories about retail. Stories that tell the tale of being in a store, perhaps working there, and the realities we all deal with when we spend our money.

A few turtles chomp on the tasty looking morsel, and a raccoon turns it over in its tiny hands until reluctantly letting it go.  The cap continues on and eventually reaches the sea years later, still as bright and red as the day it was made, and it bobs among the waves until an unlucky pelican, a female out gathering food for it's young, is able to swallow the cap, where it lodges in her stomach among other bits of plastic and slowly starves her to death.  The young back at the nest , their necks extended and mouths open wide, eventually weaken until they can no longer hold their heads up, and finally lay still in a nest made up of plastic bags and drinking straws.   The red cap is found on a beach lying among the bones and feathers of the mother bird by a child who quietly contemplates the scene.  He picks up the bright red cap and brings it to his father, the same man who threw it away many years before, and who gives the son a lecture about littering and the consequences of being environmentally irresponsible.

I needed to go reset a song on my computer and on my way back saw a hornet. It was clinging to the window, probably trying to find its way out (it was chores day, so the window was quite clean). At that moment instincts kicked in and I forcefully attacked the hornet with an arts-and-crafts project lying around of my sisters. It was a stick with some writing on it and some sinew tied to the top and it proved it self to be a poor weapon. It was too long to accuratly swing into the window area and the sinew would get wrapped around plants and such on the windowsill. At best I could fling some air at it so it would fly to some other part of the window. I quickly switched it out for a hand-towel, a personal weapon of choice. Now properly equiped I went again at the beast, first strike rendering it without flight, second strike crippiling it more severly still. Time for the kill, I grabbed a screwdriver with the intensions of crushing and severing its head, a solid plan I thought. When I placed the screwdriver something I didn't expect happened, it shook. As if to defend itself from its inevitable death. It did this continually, spasiming slightly as if to somehow get away. I couldn't figure it out, why fight? It must hurt to move like that being in the condition it was in. It was as if to the hornet that excruciating pain was better then whatever it was that came after, it fought to be alive soley because it meant being alive, no matter what condition. Feeling sorry for him I slid him onto the towel with the screwdriver. Then I set him down on the back porch, figuring that this is what it was he was looking for in the first place, to be outside.

He himself had never met his parents, but his aunt and uncle owned the tavern, and he grew up with the casks of heavy wine that never seemed to make him stronger, salted meat that left him thirsty, and stale bread that was harder than rock.  And so when the Dark Knights came riding into the town that night with their skull-like helmets and black maces crushing the futile resistance of farmers, Iant knew what he had to do.  It was simply his destiny.  And he rushed into the town square, his hand eagerly homing in on the worn out hilt, the blade sliding out from its stone sheath.  He could feel the energy flowing through his arms, and with a brave yell he charged at the Dark Knights.

The truth is I'm pretty good with computers, and the the free WiFi you use sort of works both ways ; ) Anyway, I hope you can look past that. I was just writing to say how different you are. different, and cute, and nice, and the bottom line is I really like you. I like everything about you. The face you make when you blow on your coffee, I love it. I love the way you spin your keys on your finger like a cowboy before you get in your car. I can't get enough of the fact you still listen to a cassette tape of Queen, or the little running joke you have with your mother about her corgi eating an entire box of triscuits. I Like that little dance you do when you're looking in the mirror while brushing your teeth, the really silly one, like something you would only do because you know no one is watching.

**Challenge [2.26]: Insomnia**

This week I want stories about insomnia. I don't mean that week in college you couldn't sleep, or how you don't get that many hours of sleep.

I mean real, fucking painful, no sleep at all for days insomnia. Some of us have been there and it's a strange place. After the first night you're tired, after the second you start to not feel right, and after three days without sleep you tend to enter the delirious.

I want to see stories about people struggling with true insomnia. Stories of people who can't sleep and what they do with that time. Drive the streets at 3:00 A.M., watch TV for hours, go on long trips to places and back: these are all things insomniacs do.

The one that is far away now, who I will never see again, the one whose blog posts make me cringe, and who smiles at me on facebook from time to time. We used to do just the same things. Lie in and bed and giggle and tease each other. Cook meals, watch TV shows. It was all quite pleasant. And then when it ended it was like a cyclone, a hurricane, and all of those pleasant little things got lost. All I could remember was the crying and those phone conversations from hell. And now that someone else has appeared it all starts to come back. Lying on the beach, eyes closed, holding hands, cuddling in bed and talking about our first times. All the stuff that made the separation so hard. Poof. It vanished. It was gone. That’s what I just couldn’t get over. That all of those little pleasures could just disappear in an instant.

Ambassador Jeb Bush.

Foolishly, she stopped and turned. A scream from her lips sealed all senses. The ancient devil reached for her, mouth wide in a toothy grin of spite, and while she tried to escape, he opened a portal to his dominion, and he took her--that old bastard--to the once and future furnace of man's sin. Once in the Abyss, he tormented her with heinous visions for days on end, until her mind had snapped. During that time, her screams became legend even in that terrible pit of suffering, and many demons lamented for her, alas the Lord of this place had no need for their cries of succor, and he rebuked them. For he was not done; no, for his plan was never about making her suffer at all, but rather he plotted against the sanity of men, and she would be his disposable chosen vessel of venom--injected directly into the very font of God's creation. And when her cries finally ceased, Lucifer ripped her chest open, and he replaced her still beating heart with a device of clockwork perfection--fabricated from the very same stones of which Hell itself was hewn--an artificial organ imbued with hate and power from the eons long proximity to the source of all evil: A Hellstone Heart that pumped with malice and malevolence with each passing turn of its impossible geometry.

My cell phone had been on the fritz for weeks when I finally decided to bring it in for repairs. I normally put off such small inconsequential tasks, but as I grew older I had to grudgingly acknowledge that such boring activities (paying rent, buying groceries, trying to get health insurance) were in fact major sources of happiness, if only indirectly. I stood in front of a glass case crammed filled with phones I could never afford, while the store’s only employee, a bro-ish lad with a goatee, talked animatedly into his own phone, guffawing and chortling in a definitely non-work related manner. Exasperated (and a bit desperate) I finally shouted “Is there anybody else who can help me?” “Yes! Step around the counter, if you please!” came a hoarse yell from the back. I stepped around the display case, past the oblivious salesman and into a backroom where I was suddenly face to face with a wild-haired old man. He had a main of greasy white hair, wore what appeared to be foul smelling rags, and himself reeked of alcohol. Before I could make my escape, he grasped my arm, pulled my face close to his and rasped “Before it’s too late son, save yourself before it’s too late. Rid yourself of material things and go off to the country to live in peace in a little shack where you learn to play the trumpet and read poetry. Go, now, now, before it’s too late!” Terrified, I wrenched myself free and ran out past the still yammering salesman into the freezing January air. Once safely on the sidewalk, I paused. Was it a message from God? On an impulse I took out my phone, wallet and apartment keys and held them over a trashcan. Should I? Was this the bold move that would make my life better and allow me to stop focusing on boring things? My fingers twitched but then I grew scared, shoved everything in my pocket and sprinted back to my apartment through the throngs of indifferent pedestrians.

Walking down the street, lost in thought, I suddenly came across  my ex-girlfriend bending over a garbage can, picking out stray bits of food. Though I had not seen her since our devastating break-up the day after our college graduation, I knew in an instant that it was her. That same face that I’d kissed thousands of times, the same hair that I had caressed as we lay in bed watching movies on her laptop, and the same back that my hand had grazed as we sat on the beach feeling warm and happy. And she was now reduced to foraging for her food like some sort of animal. She was intent on her task, peering into the can, shifting around the bits of paper, the apple cores, banana peels, empty coke bottles. Homeless, a vagrant, reduced to the extremes of poverty, because some emotionally unstable college student (myself) had broken her heart, sending her into a psychological tailspin that had ruined any chance she might have had for a normal life. I wanted to run away and die. But I could not. I had to speak. I had to somehow try and make amends for what I’d done. Even though no words, not even the offer of a hot meal, or a supermarket gift card could repair the wholesale destruction of a life, I had to try. “Karen, hey, it’s me.” She looked up and her face brightened. “Todd? Oh my God, so good to see you! I was wondering what you were up to! The most ridiculous thing, I dropped my iphone in here. God it’s gross. Do you mind helping me look?”

It is a knight. He rides through silky meadows, climbs steep and treacherous mountains, before stopping at the foot of a tall turret. He peers upwards, the sun glinting in his eye, he hears a voice…and the tip of the pencil breaks leaving nothing but a jagged, wooden socket. I pause, and terror seizes me. What if anyone I knew saw this story? I imagine the merciless mockery, recess spent sitting silently against a brick wall watching the others play. Eating lunch alone while chewing pathetically on a dry peanut butter sandwich. I rip off the page, crush it into a ball, and throw it against the wall.

I really liked the challenge and want to give a big thanks to lucidenigma for coming up with the idea and spearheading the whole project. Really, I can not thank you enough.

---------------------

And so, we march on writing.

**Challenge [2.17]: ""I'm sorry.""**

This week I want to try a different approach. I'm giving you a piece of dialogue, and you can do whatever you want with it. The rules are it has to be the first line of the story.

So, this week start a story with the line ""I'm sorry.""

It's a powerful and vague starting line. It can take you anywhere and the subsequent story can be in any person. 

Really think it over, what have you honestly been sorry about? Was it to someone else? To yourself? Ever have anyone honestly be sorry to you?

Did you ever feign an apology to make yourself seem better in a situation?

This gives you a lot of possibilities from one specific direction.

Have fun!

**Challenge [2.13]: Politics**

With the American election this week I decided to go a bit vague and ask for stories about politics. 

That could really be... anything. 

Is it a story about a politician? 

An allegory for some political doctrine you believe in or disagree with? 

A snarky tale mocking politics you see as silly? 

A cynical piece about the never-ending stream of disappoints we get from most politicians?

An indifference which extends to our fear before every day at work, to the tension we feel day in and day out. A world which cares only if we smile when we should smile, if we frown when we should frown, if we move object A from Place B to Place C, if we have conversation A with person B.

Her students openly mocked her, greeted her jokes with uncomprehending silence, and then ignored her frantic attempts to restore order whenever an activity spun out of control, which was often. Through a mix of bureaucratic inertia and incompetence she had progressed steadily up the ladder every year, her “Satisfactory” performance evaluation dutifully filed by an apathetic vice-principal, so that despite her glaring mediocrity, obvious to anyone who spent more than 5 minutes in her tumultuous classes, she now had tenure.

If you read through the material we have so far, and you don't see anything you want to build off of, go back to the original story and pick a different element to build from.  W can have multiple threads running at once, each building the world out in different directions, so to speak.

You don't have to continue the story -- in fact, it's recommended that you don't.  The point is to build up the world, so that each of the 1P stories in this thread can be said to take place in more or less the same world.

For our first attempt at this game, my co-moderator multirachael has agreed to let me use one of her stories as a starter: ""[The Strange Account of the Carnivorous Sponges of the Graveyard Seamount Complex](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/cfoh0/the_strange_account_of_the_carnivorous_sponges_of/).""

&gt; ""Aye, cully; them carnivorous sponges did come from t'Gothic, o'er in t'Graveyard, they did. Crept up in the night, surrounded our wessel; those that weren't wakened by the horrible sucking noises they made were devoured, screaming, in their beds.

I won't never forget the sounds...an' I swear I won't never sail by the Graveyard again...""

I'll make one reply below just to get us started; feel free to build off of that, or start your own.

grab it. He checked with Mr. Wolfe, his shop teacher, if it was ok to print something big on the new 3D printers. Mr. Wolfe said it was fine, they actually had about two tons of polymers they had to get rid of so the new shipment could come in. Being the CAD Shop class TA, he had the keys to the shop and lab.

""Hey, do you want any mac n' cheese? I'm gunna make some""

I turned to see the ghostly specter of my ex-girlfriend standing, rather, floating in my kitchenette. She looked like every depiction of a ghost I'd ever seen in movies; she was light blue, barely transparent, and hovered roughly six inches above the floor. 

""err... sure?"", I replied, hesitantly. 

Was she really back from the beyond? Did she even die, for that matter? I had heard no news of her death if it had happened. But here she was, ghostly cooking my pasta. I watched her cautiously. Her hands, clearly too ethereal for this plane, were passing straight through the pot and wooden spoon that she appeared to be cooking with. She merely pantomimed cuisine. I watched as she reached toward the bowls, made an exaggerated pouring motion, and shoved an invisible meal into my hands. I humored her and pretended to eat alongside her. I took this chance to get a closer look at her. She was clearly the same girl I had known. Though she was clearly not alive, her vivacity still radiated like a warm sun. Next to her, I was scorched to desert. Her smile was a pitcher of cool water and her lips were the cup from which I craved drink. If only she knew how much I had missed her. I put my invisible meal down and kissed her. She appeared surprised but kissed me back. 

""I know those eyes"", she said. ""Hold on, I've got a surprise for you""

She leaned back and strode into my bedroom, emerging moments later in lingerie that she bought two summers ago. Beside myself, I followed her to the bed. 

""Do you have anything in mind?"" she asked. 

""No, I'll follow your lead"", I replied. 

She gave me a sad smile that, for a moment, made me wonder if perhaps she was not fully alive and I the husk of a former man. She kissed me again, so powerfully that I could almost feel her lips. She fell on to me like light on a forest floor and I receded to the bed. Instantly, she became cloudy, as though her outline had smeared. She kissed me again and, again, she became even more vaporous. I touched my face. It was wet. I wiped the tears from my eyes and the phantom was gone. I was alone again.

**[2.20] Challenge: New Years**

So, this week is New Years Eve. It's the holiday of sentimentality, drunkenness, and hugging your friends tight because you've made it through another year together.

This week I want you to write stories based around the general idea of a ""new year"". This can be taken pretty broadly. You could do something specific like a story in a New Years party, or someone starting their first year of school. You can take it broader: a character recalling a year of sobriety or the years counted since their wife died.

Take it wherever you want but keep the idea of a ""new year"" in there somewhere.

On that note: enjoy the new year, stay safe out there tomorrow. See you all in 2013!

Jakobs sniffed to clear his nose and paced behind the President, nervously tapping the pistol barrel against his head. His mind was made up already, I knew that the moment I saw his prisoner. He was just waiting, waiting. Finally he stopped directly behind the President and looked me straight in the eye. His face showed that he well knew the depth of what he was about to do. ""I'm giving you a chance here, Tim,"" he said quietly, ""if you want, you can back out now. No questions, no hard feelings. 'Cause what I'm about to do cant be undone."" There was an audible click.

It is the single attribute that can allow a thing to overcome definable reality. This is because we cannot comprehend reality separate from any passage of time, and therefore granting an object the power to transcend time is basically calling it *divine.* So where does this leave us as we are so unavoidably bound in time? Where does this leave the grandest efforts of mankind to advance itself simply for the sake of progress? It truly is a noble thing to seek with no expectation of reward, but nobility does not nullify absurdity. Did some kitschy rock band from the 70's have it right all along? Are we all only dust in the proverbial winds of time? It's rhetorical of course, but the question leaves me remembering an ant I stepped on once. I say ""an ant"" because, truthfully, I have crushed quite a few ants in my life but I fail to remember a single ant specifically. So my concern is: If I cannot remember any of those ants that I have needlessly and grieflessly crushed, how will the universe ever remember me?

“A hurricane? Bah,” he thought to himself as he stared out the window. “Rain? You call this rain? Wind? You call this wind? A sorry excuse indeed. I had expected much better, yes much better. Why did I stock up on all that food? For what purpose did I purchase all those cans of beans? A sorry excuse for a hurricane indeed.” He continued pacing around his apartment. There was still a chance of course. Perhaps he had misread the radar and the 80 mile an hour winds would rip through the city that night, downing tree branches, cutting power and unleashing the citywide disaster that he had envisioned when he first heard of the hurricane a few days before. And when that happened he would be ready. He glanced at his samurai sword and his Japanese throwing stars resting on the coffee table, along with his freshly polished shield. Yes, when disaster struck, when he had to fend off the looters as they pounded manically at his door, desperate to rob his last can of beans, he would be ready.

Good story Foxfar, and congrats.

Thanks as always to all those that submitted. I'm seeing more and more new submissions, so my message to those newbies out there: Submit earlier!. The earlier in the week you submit, the more people read it, the more likely you are to win the contest. Even if you don't care about winning, it'll inspire other first timers to finally give submitting a go.

**Challenge [2.12]: Truly Terrifying**

Halloween is upon us. That means scary movies, stories, and music. 

Scary stories can be fun. 

But that's what I want you to avoid. 

Avoid scary stuff that's fun, silly, surreal, or unreal. I don't want to see stories about vampires, ghosts, or axe-murders.

I want to see stories about things that are actually *truly terrifying*. 

The sort of shit that makes people stay up late at night. 

The sort of shit you bury deep inside. 

The sort of shit that festers within you.

The sort of shit you that makes your body tense up as you fall into a deep anxiety attack. 

What do I mean then by truly terrifying things?

*Dying unloved and alone*

*Realizing none of your friends really care about you*

*Agonizing over your fear of death*

*Crippling social phobia*

*The blinding ignorance of the masses*

*The facade you've created around yourself*

*Settling down because you stopped caring*

*An unfulfilled life* 

*Sadness that prevents you from leaving your bed*

*Regret that weighs down on you every day*






Writing story about a psychopath or some M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist... that's been done to death.

Let's hear stories about the things that scare us everyday. The fears we deal with constantly and rule us.

You think I want to be here? You really think I want to stand here and fake smile while you guys stare at your shoes and roll your eyes at everything I say? DO YOU THINK THIS MAKES ME HAPPY?! I mean, yes clearly, in an ideal world, all of our basic necessities (food production, clean water, transportation) would be taken care of by robots who did NOT take over the world and subsequently enslave us to probe us with their steely cold robot arms. And in this ideal world we would do nothing but eat pastries, play tennis, whiffle ball and go swimming and read books that we liked and occasionally have sex with beautiful women without things ever getting weird or awkward afterwards. And then in the evenings we’d play cards and music and sit around big bonfires and laugh and tell stories. But since we CAN’T have that for the love of GOD, please just throw me a bone, stop your horrific, pimply 13 year-old flirting and fill out the god damn worksheet!

The **[2.4]** challenge

Conventions.

I don't mean cultural norms. I mean *conventions*. You know, a bunch of people getting together because they all bond over a shared interest or idea. 

Right now in America we have the Republican convention going on, and next week will be the Democratic one. These are probably the best known conventions in the country.

But every weekend all across the country in civic centers and hotel lobbies people *convene*. 

Southern Baptists, model-railroaders, UFO buffs, comic book lovers, or swingers. They all get together and share a little piece of themselves with each other. For many it's a chance to bond with others over something they obsess about alone. It's a chance for people to come out of their shell, to meet, to talk, and to revel in something they love. It's a place for them to be vulnerable without fear. 

So, what happens when these people get together?

Hit by a laundry truck. Choked to death on a banana because he slipped on a banana peel. Crushed to death by a clown. Something absurd that would lend his last hours a touch of pathos, an air of comedy. Something that would make people both laugh and cry as they gathered around his coffin. But right up until that point, it would be a life of smooth, unruffled purity. Because he had figured it out. The only truth there is. That life is all about human connection. Voila. That’s all there is. Simple. With a grunt, he heaved himself off the sofa, ignoring the half-eaten bag of doritos which fell from his lap. “You hear me world,” he bellowed to his empty apartment. “I am coming to connect with you!

If you read a 1P story that you like, and you're interested to see some of the author's other submissions, this is the place to check.

If you've ever posted a story to /r/1P, you're invited to add your index to the comments below. Read on for instructions on how to do that.

**Instructions:**   
In the reddit search bar, type:

    reddit:oneparagraph author:[your_name]

So to come up with *my* index, I'd search for

    reddit:oneparagraph author:blackstar9000

If you want to exclude anything, use the *NOT* operator. To exclude more than one term, use *NOT* and include the terms in parentheses, separating them with the *OR* operator. For example, in my index, I excluded a whole slew of moderator-related terms:

    NOT ([talk] OR [game] OR challenge)

There's actually more than that, but you get the picture. That way, when you click on my index, just about all you'll find listed there are stories.

I've felt certain misgivings about some of the stories that I've written lately.  Some of them, I suspect, aren't really one paragraph stories.  Take my [most recent contribution](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/bhqs4/rapunzel_redux/) (please!).  I wrote it with every intention of making it a one paragraph story, but if I had it to do over again, I'd probably throw in at least one break, like so:

&gt; Maybe because each generation owes a debt to tradition, Caroline also told the story, though not as her mother had told it to her. In the version Caroline passed on to her daughters, Rapunzel poured so much vanity on her hair that she found the notion of turning it to merely useful ends unthinkable. It was the treasure, not she, and so when the prince called, she refused to let it down. The prince was too enamored to relent, though, so he gradually began to build a magnificent castle around the tower, incorporating it so that they could be said to share the same accommodations -- in spirit, for now, and one day, hopefully, in full truth.

&gt; The final element in the design of the castle was a matching tower with traversable arch to bridge the rest of the structure to the original tower, and when the builders at last carved their door into Rapunzel's chamber they found that she had died sometime during the interval. This surprised no one since the construction of the castle had taken decades, and even the prince himself had not lived to see its completion. ""But her hair remained,"" Caroline would conclude, knowing that her mother stood in the hallway eavesdropping, ""and my! wasn't it beautiful, even in death.""

Don't get me wrong.  Given a time machine, I wouldn't go back to yesterday and tell myself, ""Stop!  That should really be two paragraphs.""  Part of what's great about this subreddit is that we get to experiment with the form, and we lose that element if we stop experimenting for fear of failing.  But on reading back over, it *does* seem clear to me that there's a natural break in the action, from ascending to descending, and that it's proper to mark that break with a new paragraph.  Am I wrong about that?

Incidentally, if anyone feels like workshopping that story, here's a challenge for you: rewrite it in such a way that it adheres more closely to the one paragraph rule.  I'm not sure it can be done, but the effort might be revealing.

But the big question I want to throw out here is this: **What are some other circumstances that might naturally call for a paragraph break?**",,False,,t5_2rkb7,False,,,True,t3_bi54j,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/bi54j/talk_when_is_a_paragraph_more_than_a_single/,

The man in the mirror has no answer, all the while the shower drums on, water beating the bottom of the tub. Those burning, yellow lights highlight the imperfections in my face like somebody editing a rough draft. ""You could be better,"" they whisper to me. I stare sadly into the eyes of this poor man stuck in the glass, turn, and get into the shower. Once I'm done cleaning myself, I leave the bathroom and head back to my room. The lamplight is warm against my eyes like a blanket to cold toes. Very slowly, I get dressed; t-shirt, jeans, socks, shoes. I grab my wallet, phone, and keys, as I head for the front door. To the right of the doorway, my backpack sits, waiting for its chance to burden my shoulders. Grudgingly, I grab it and sling it across one shoulder. My little car rusts in the front yard. It doesn't shine for the ladies, but it does its job. I unlock the door and toss my backpack to the passenger seat, which probably would not appreciate the backpack to the face, if it weren't an inanimate object. My body drops into the driver's seat, and I slide the key into the ignition. Now, I sit again, motionless and still. This is the second half of that moment I was telling you about earlier. Again, I'm faced with a decision: start my car and drive to school like a good little boy, or I could just drive away - from school, from home, from everything. I look at myself in the rear-view mirror. That sad man in the bathroom mirror has followed me out here. Maybe he needs a ride. I look him dead in the eyes and ask, ""Where do you want to go?"" But, once again, the man in the mirror has no answer. Sadly, I look away from the mirror, start my car, and drive to school like a good little boy who secretly wants to disobey.

We had been sleeping together once a week for the last month. Every Thursday evening I would trundle off to her apartment with chips and salsa or a six pack of beer. We would watch the Office and 30 Rock, have sex, and then I wouldn’t see her again for another week. Our encounters around school (we were graduate students) were awkward, she sweet and shy, me wracked by anxiety, feeling like a bashful middle schooler at one of those awful dances, where I had spent most of the time stuffing my face with chips, too scared to ask anyone to dance. But god-damn it, this girl was pretty and sweet, loved reading, and she had soft straight brown hair. Who was to say that our current state of “friends with benefits” might not blossom into something more permanent if only I took the right, carefully calibrated steps? Valentine’s day rolled helpfully around and determined to give this thing a kick in the pants, I bought her a card and two small pieces of chocolate cake, upon which I placed two carefully chosen Candy Hearts (“sweetheart” and “my girl”). “Oh that’s so sweet,” she said as we settled down in front of the TV and my heart soared. After the Office, we watched National Geographic. A bloody, battered fish carcass was thrown into the water, and was soon surrounded by ravenous, thrashing sharks. We both agreed that it was gross but sort of cool. After an hour, I decided to go (forgoing the usual sex to show her my level of commitment). “Oh hey, here’s the thing,” she said, looking at the floor as I put on my coat, ""I’m not really interested in anything serious right now, maybe I’ve been sending the wrong signals?” Two weeks later I found out she’d been seeing someone else.

Now, the [2.9] Challenge

**The Alcoholic** 

The alcoholic writer is a trope is old as fiction itself. So let's move a little past that to something more general: The alcoholic as a broad character. 

Simply put this week I want to see stories about alcoholics. We've all known one in our time, at least one, usually more. It's a person we've all met and a character we've all read about. 

This is pretty general and you can do a lot with it. Are you writing from the point of view of an alcoholic? Someone dealing with an alcoholic? Someone in the depths of a bender? A person five years sober having a moment of weakness?

Let's hear stories about alcoholics.  ",,False,,t5_2rkb7,1350098666.0,,,True,t3_1141z7,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/1141z7/28_winner_and_29_challenge/,

**[2.7] Challenge**

This week I'm going somewhere different with the prompt. I'm going very general, but very specific in a way.

**Pick One**

I'm going to give you a list of three objects. You must use the object you pick in your story, not just mention it in passing. You can only use one of the three objects. The object must be used for its intended purpose (i.e. if a table were on the list you would have to use it to put something on, not break it over someone's head). 

So, here's your list of objects. 

Pick one, use it wisely:

- A Bottle of Red Wine

- A Pair of Sunglasses ",,False,,t5_2rkb7,1348456617.0,,,True,t3_10di43,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/10di43/26_winner_redesign_and_27_challenge/,

I whispered my fear into cobwebs. What if I was caught? What if they found out I had sliced a human as easily as I slice a piece of fruit? In all my dreams of you my legs, my hands, and my hair glow a deep golden citrus. I never told you your kisses are too light and your chest smells like the underside of rocks.I never told you that I slept terribly next you, sitting up, dreamless, to look at your open strawberry mouth and your peach skin wondering who the hell you are. Why do you come to my spurious dreams every night?

One of the most ancient stories known is *The Epic of Gilgamesh*.  It was written at least four thousand years ago.  It was pieced together by fragments of stone tablets found at several archaeological sites.  Not all of it has been found, but there is enough to follow the story.

It is the story of the king Gilgamesh's friendship with the wild man Enkidu and their adventures together.  At the climax of the story, Enkidu is killed, and Gilgamesh begins a downward spiral into madness in which he roams the world searching for immortality.

Gilgamesh's love for Enkidu is a bond that enriches him during their time together.  It emboldens him to adventure across the world and defeat evil monsters.  Their friendship is his greatest strength.  But when Enkidu dies, that love between them binds him in a different way.  It cripples him.  The once great and mighty King becomes a hollow shell of a man who abandons his kingdom and squanders his life trying to escape his inevitable death.  The ties that bind them together are a double-edged sword.

This week, write a paragraph in which you explore a similar bond that is simultaneously enriching and defeating.",,False,,t5_2rkb7,True,,,True,t3_lc6yq,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/lc6yq/challenge_65_ties_that_bind_us/,moderator

He didn't like it when she'd talk like that; in Cambodia, after the revolution, kids were lucky to even go to school. He hadn't. He drove a cyclo through Phnom Penh everyday making just pennies. Once he stole flowers from a grave and glued them all over his rusty cyclo to attract better customers but the glue melted in the heat and they all fell off one by one. After, he began robbing his customers. He'd turn them down an alley where his friends waited and they would split the money. He had been strong then, rough. His daughter did not know that. Yet now in America his daughter made fun of him and skipped school and he *had* gotten fat. So today everyone would see old fat Haing struggling to peddle a pink bicycle with his American daughter sitting atop the handlebars; a single yellow flower in her flowing black hair.

Sometimes he was walking past them, other times he was jumping over them. Other times he felt trapped by them. He was familiar with gates. The relationship that Alan had with gates was simple, but it worked. They opened for him, and he walked through. But this gate was different. For the first time, Alan found himself wondering, not about what lie on the other side, but about the gate itself. Who had put it there? When? Why? These burning questions seemed important until he was close enough to touch the gate. It was an ornate piece of work. It looked like it had been standing in quite the same position for milennia. Ivy wound its way up the bronze poles on either side, coiled perfectly.  Alan just stared. The gate was magnificent, but he had other matters to attend to. He had seen the gate. He knew where the gate led. He even knew why it had appeared to him when it did. But there was work yet to be done. He would not pass through those gates yet.

That's exciting stuff for a sub with such an idiosyncratic format. Thanks to everyone who has participated or simply read along, and especially to those who have helped recruit fresh blood. Here's to many more stories and readers in the future!

Secondly, as per [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/exwlx/talk_what_can_we_do_to_make_roneparagraph_a/c1cmob9?context=1) in our recent [brainstorming thread](http://redd.it/exwlx) (which, incidentally, I'm still checking if anyone has any more ideas), we're introducing a new tag: **[WS]**. It stands for *workshop*, and signals your desire to improve the story with the help of other subscribers. You can apply it to the title or body of your submission to request constructive comments on what you've written. By signaling your desire for help, the [WS] tag can potentially encourage more discussion and constructive criticism of the stories posted to /r/1P.

If you see a story marked with the [WS] tag, be sure to drop into its comment section and give any feedback or advice you may have. I hope to see the tag used more frequently than not.

Thanks to stoicsmile for the idea. If the need arises, we may add more tags to our lexicon. I'll be updating the sidebar soon, so expect to see [WS] made clear there as well.",,False,,t5_2rkb7,False,,,True,t3_f6ikr,http://www.reddit.com/r/OneParagraph/comments/f6ikr/talk_ws_and_our_first_1000/,

He loved the crowd. He'd never let them down. He twisted the throttle, feeling the power of almost 200 horses roaring under his seat. He let the clutch go, accelerating rapidly. He heard nothing anymore, except the sound of his motor. He saw nothing, except the ramp approaching rapidly. He was one with the bike. They had told him it was impossible, but he had heard that a million times before. It all happened very fast. As soon as he hit the ramp, he could feel that something was slightly off, but it was too late to stop. He still pressed the nitro button. The acceleration pushed him up the ramp. As planned, he started arching his back as soon as his front tire left the ramp. His helmet hit the top edge. He never remembered anything after that. They told him, but he never had the courage to watch the video. Not after the doctors told him he'd never be able to ride again. His hands were nearly useless now. His neck was stiff with the metal plate. His stamina was gone, with the right lung he'd lost. He was lucky to be alive, they said... But he didn't consider this living. So he decided he had only one choice. With his almost useless fingers, he managed to press a button and go to the top floor. He climbed the ledge and inhaled as much as he could of the air with his remaining left lung. For a moment, the sensation of the height and the wind, brought back feelings of elation, the memories of moments that would never return. Down 15 stories, someone noticed him. He heard them shout above the noise. ""Look at that idiot! Is he gonna jump?!?!"" He looked down at the teenagers pointing and starting to cheer him on. He smiled, leaned forward and once more let the crowd guide him as they yelled ""Jump! Jump! Jump!""

He thrust his hand into his pocket, making sure the ring was still there.  He didn’t want to forget it.  He pulled out the picture of her which hadn’t left his person since he had left the hospital; she was so beautiful.  Suddenly déjà vu overwhelmed him.  Only a few weeks ago he went through an eerily similar process; nervously tapping his pocket to make sure he didn’t forget the ring, preparing himself for the big moment.  He remembered her asking where they were going when he took an early exit, heading to the secluded spot where they had first kissed.  That seemed like a lifetime ago now.  His mind had been racing with nervous anticipation; he could not wait to see the look on her face.  Perhaps his musing had been the reason why he didn’t notice the light was red.  He awoke a day later, but she never did.  This moment had been inevitable since then.  He could not go on but he could not pull the trigger himself, lest that final act rob him of eternity with her.  He had fired a few shots into the walls about an hour ago, just to attract the necessary attention, than waited in silence with a glass of wine to calm his nerves.  Sirens signaled their arrival.  He opened the door and peered out at the man with the bullhorn.  He was ready to take that fateful step; prepared to be with the woman he loved forever.

For a minute, they were still. Her head felt warm on his chest, and his smile reflected his peace of mind. Her hand moved up to the back of his neck.

Despite the surroundings of 17 million people, the blur has become much more manageable.  Without the initial start of frenetic searching, days have taken on that repetitious quality that is a standard work week.  Sunday is dreaded because Monday is looming and Monday begets a much easier Tuesday, but it's not common anymore to be awed by 2 yuan noodle cart biking down the street or a three lane highway filled six buses across or a family of four sleeping together on lounge chairs on the sidewalk of a busy street at 4 in the afternoon or to see a baby with a slit in the trousers in lieu of diapers or even to see the slit in the trousers put to use or to have my hair washed and cut, ears cleaned and head massaged for $2 USD.
