1354434514.0,885,self.DnD,1456hn,Biggest mistakes ever made as a DM?,eldritchkraken,1157,272,1095,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1456hn/biggest_mistakes_ever_made_as_a_dm/,"Let's learn from each other and share the biggest mistakes we've ever made or witnessed as/from a Dungeon Master.

My very first campaign was a complete disaster. I used 4th edition D&amp;D as a basis for my world because I had little experience with other systems. However, the world was set in the equivalent to the 1890s of our world. So, naturally, the world had guns. I homebrewed the weapon myself, making attack rolls based on the type of gun wielded and the damage based on bullets. For crits, you had to roll a d100 (based on body percentage area) to determine effects.

So, in character creation, I did have one player that decided to use guns. He started out with a crappy weapon, just like everyone else (pretty much same strength as a shortbow). And throughout the first two sessions of the campaign, he failed to hit even a single target with his bullets. So I figured he wasn't that much of a threat.

Then, the third session started and they made it to their first boss character. I designed him to be kind of a challenge, because being a necromancer he was squishy, but once he was first bloodied he would heal and summon a zombie hulk.

So, the party initiates combat with the boss. First round, they attempt to kill him with dynamite. Not wanting to ruin a perfectly good boss, it is knocked away at the last second by the necromancer's familiar (who was on his shoulder). After that, some people attempt to chip away at some of the zombies and skeletons the boss summoned. Finally, the party's gunman gets his turn. He does a basic ranged attack.

Natural 20. He rolls to see where the bullet hit.

Boom. Headshot. Instant kill, on a boss, not even two rounds into the fight.

I was so embarrassed about this, plus other mistakes I made, that I ended the campaign not too soon after that. And my former gunman has still not let me live it down to this day.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_1456hn,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1456hn/biggest_mistakes_ever_made_as_a_dm/,

Monotonous, rigid, and not entirely helpful. I've been working on a new way of teaching the game (that can be expanded to other RPGs as well) that takes the tutorial aspect and marries it to actual gameplay so you can see how each choice effects the game. 

I have a couple other ideas up my sleeve but I'm interested to hear what sorts of things you commonly run into when trying to get new people to play, or just teaching new players? What obstacles do you run into?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your amazing feedback and support! You all get 100XP. I will post back as soon as I have a website up so you can follow the progress. Right now I'm pitching the idea to several channels which has generated some interest. If that doesn't work we'll go the Kickstarter route.

Among the various clues they find a small stone box that seems out of place and they show it to the shop owner who says that he was looking for that.

One of the biggest things I've noticed here is the lack of upvoting. It's not a lack of activity, there are tons of readers and comments, it's just a lack of people clicking that little upright triangle.

It encourages people to reply if they see that positive karma. It's nice to know that your comments are appreciated. I've noticed plenty of threads in which the OP replies to someone's comment but doesn't upvote. There are entire threads where every comment has 1 karma.

You don't need to find a comment inspired or even useful to upvote. Anything that adds to the discussion without breaking the rules is fair game. You won't be banned for upvoting the wrong comments :D. Upvotes aren't the bonus XPs you get for good role-playing, they're the standard XPs you get for killing orcs. Let's be good DMs and start passing them out!

**edit** I do like that this reddit is not all image posts, most reddits have to ban image posts to achieve this. Some here seem to think that loosey-goosey upvoting will ruin this. There has to be a happy medium...

Three parts in the same day, good God. I don't know why these posts are getting as many downvotes as they are, since they seem to be generally well-received, but whatever. To each their own.

Anyway, when we left off Chris had made the terrible mistake of letting Z put his castle that he got upon pulling the Throne card from the Deck of Many Things wherever he wanted. And now he was the Baron of a thriving city, sharing his power with the rest of the group. We had brought all of our cursed loot with us, and had the intent to find a court wizard and several mages to serve under him to detect evil on all of the stuff. We had also called the nobles to the castle for a stern talking-to, or something to that effect.

Z: ""Gentlemen. I imagine you're wondering why I have gathered you here. It's unfortunate that I forgot...""

Steve: ""Wait, what? How did you forget?""

Z: ""That was all the way last week. I'm not infallible, you know. I forget things, too.""

Jay: ""The Liches, right?""

Z: ""Ah, right. You see, gentlemen, not long ago, we killed the Necromancer controlling a group of Liches, and now they're out for our blood. Naturally, this isn't any good. If the Liches get here, then, well... let's not talk about that. What I need is for you all to put your petty squabbling for my favor behind you and kick up your personal guard forces, since I know you all have them. They need to go out in larger groups, cover more ground, and be more attentive, especially at night. Naturally I'll have the city guards out as well, but your forces will help greatly. Work together for once so we don't all die at the hands of two super Liches.""

The nobles were naturally rather shocked to hear this, and started freaking out. The thought of their lives being ended by the undead, who they didn't even think were real to begin with, was completely foreign to them and scary as it gets.

Steve: ""And, you know, if you try to flee the city, they'll probably just track you down and kill you anyway for associating with us. That and they're evil, so they might just do it for sport.""

Jay: ""Heidi, don't you still have two wishes? Couldn't you wish to have their phylacteries, or for them to be teleported to the bottom level of the Nine Hells and burn to death?""

Heidi: ""Yes, but I'd rather not use them right now. We might need them more later. If we're prepared for the Liches, we can probably take them.""

Chainsaw: ""I'm with her. I think it'd be preferable to be able to wish for a dragon attacking the city to die spontaneously, or a cure for a plague running through it. You know, stuff we can't prepare for.""

Jay: ""Fair point.""

The nobles reluctantly accepted the task laid before them, and left the keep. Next up was selecting a court wizard so we could have all of this stuff identified. The adviser had brought quite a few mages, and rather than hand pick them to be castle mages or not, we decided they all would be and anyone who thought himself fit to lead the group could come forward and prove himself.

We ended up with some Gandalf-looking guy coming forward, only to be challenged by another young wizard to a duel. Gandalf quite literally blew him up into chunks of meat after asking if that's what the other guy really wanted. Needless to say, Z was ecstatic to have this dude leading them. He just turned another dude into mincemeat pie, and even tried to tell the guy to back off. He turned out to be quite wise and intelligent, with vast knowledge of damn near everything. And so Gandalf was appointed as court wizard, and the mages had their first task given to them, which they dutifully accepted and got to doing.

More servants and guards were brought, along with a few master blacksmiths who were commissioned to gear up the guards with better equipment. A few days later, Gandalf came forward to inform us that *everything* we had brought forward was evil.

Z: ""Say what now?""

Gandalf: ""Every item you brought forward not only has magical qualities, but all of it is undoubtedly evil. They could possibly have the evil purged from them by priests, but I wouldn't completely bet on them. If one of these items is indeed a phylactery, we have no been able to discern it, and the best course of action would be to smelt all of the items down.""

Z: ""If we had them crafted into other things, like ingots or something like that, would the ingots be magical, evil, or both?""

Gandalf: ""Items with magical affinity will always have magical properties, but upon being melted and burned down, any potential goodness or evilness is purged from the item, since it is beginning anew, unless it's Drowcraft or something to that effect.""

Z: ""Woah. That's neat. When a phylactery is destroyed, is there any way to discern whether or not it was one? Does it give off a little magical explosion or something?""

Gandalf: ""Yes. Upon being destroyed, a phylactery will give a visible clue. For example, if it was a small box, what one could call a soul would escape from the box, destroying the Lich in the process. The same goes if part of the phylactery was a bottle with an enchanted liquid inside; when the bottle broke, a soul would be seen leaving the liquid.""

Steve: ""That's pretty cool. So all we have to do is smelt all of these things one by one and watch them do it so we can tell whether or not a phylactery was destroyed?""

Gandalf: ""Yes, that is correct.""

Jay: ""What if none of them are phylacteries? We'd kill the Lich and it would revive in a few days. Can we imprison or destroy a Lich without destroying the phylactery?""

Gandalf: ""Not by any normal means, no. But, seeing as Liches are magical beings, one could potentially create an anti-magic field to store the Lich's body in before it revives. You could also carve and enchant Silencing runes on the bones, in which case the Lich would be trapped within the bones, unable to use its powers to revive.""

Jay: ""That's neat. So if we don't destroy a phylactery, we'd just have to kill the Lich and carve some stuff into its bones and stick those in an A/M field, just to be safe. Maybe even put it in a silenced sack for good measure.""

Chainsaw: ""I don't think 'just kill the Lich' is an okay way to put it. We only got away with killing two because we were lucky. And then these two absorbed the other two. They're even more powerful now. And they're still smart. If they've been watching us, they'll know that we have an army now. They could easily bring one of their own, right?""

Heidi: ""Well, let's have the stuff smelted down and hope that they're destroyed.""

We brought all the crap to the blacksmiths and had them smelt everything down, one at a time. Suddenly, a scream was heard as a blue wisp shot out of a pocket watch, kind of like the way Paranormal Activity ended. We all rejoiced, as there was still a lot of stuff to smelt down, and hopefully somewhere in there was the other one.

We never found the second one. We even decided to smelt any coinage we found, to no avail. We had dropped one Lich, but there was still one out there, and it was likely even more vengeful than before.

Chainsaw: ""Well, shit. We saw the other two Liches we killed get absorbed by the two that were still alive. Is it possible that the remaining Lich could absorb the one we just offed?""

Gandalf: ""Yes. In fact, if they were together, it is quite likely. The reason that happened the first time is because Liches are quite power hungry. They will absorb anything with great magical power as soon as they can. When that phylactery was destroyed, the Lich's soul was stripped, but its magical power would have faded over the course of a few hours.""

Chainsaw: ""But we didn't destroy the phylacteries of the other ones. We had only temporarily killed them.""

Gandalf: ""You must have destroyed their phylacteries in some way. If you were in the thick of combat, you most likely failed to notice the cues.""

Z: ""But I was standing right over the bottles I smashed when they were absorbed... Wait, what if the Necromancer had them on him, and hit the ground hard or something, breaking the phylacteries? We wouldn't have seen or heard anything.""

Gandalf: ""That's quite possible, and most likely what happened.""

Heidi: ""But we still have one crazy vengeful Lich out there who probably knows where we are and could completely raze the city, even if it was alone. We'd probably be hard-pressed to take it down. And if it's four times stronger than it was to begin with, it probably won't take it long to reanimate.""

Z: ""So, we're boned. Fun, fun, fun. Or most likely boned. You should check out Chainsaw's leg, it's all weird and stuff after we lopped it off and regrew it.""

Chainsaw had taken Steve's advice to wear shorts and a long piece of loose fabric to cover up his demon leg, so it hadn't been noticed by anybody. In fact, we almost completely forgot about it. Chainsaw lifted his leg, and Gandalf's eyes widened at the sight of it.

Gandalf: ""So you encountered a Great Wraith, eh? You're lucky to have survived. Cutting the leg off was the right idea. It would have spread to the rest of the body within a few hours. Though I've never seen a limb regrown... very interesting. But if it isn't hurting you, then you should be fine.""

Knowing what could have happened, Chainsaw thanked everyone for immediately slicing his leg off instead of looking for a more humane way to do it. Then again, we probably would have held him down and done it even if he refused since we're sick bastards.

The next few days of noble life were actually quite fun. We checked out the city, talked to the people, threw parties at the castle where all were invited, and people quickly grew to like their new ruler. Z had been taking notes the whole time and was rather quiet, though, which was unusual.

Steve: ""You're far too quiet. What are you planning?""

Z: ""It'd be unfair to not tell the people that we have a Lich coming, I think. So I figured if everyone liked us enough, I could work some speechcraft and get them prepared for the possibility of an attack. You know, start training them to defend themselves, since he'll probably bring an army. Reinforce walls, be vigilant, report any suspicious activity. If they trust us, they'll do it instead of fleeing. And if they invaded and half of our city is in chaos, then it'll be much harder to defend. If we had a bunch of dudes firing crossbows at the zombie hordes from their windows, everything would work out much better.""

Jay: ""What's gotten into you? You're planning things that don't involve random acts of insanity. Are you joining us normal people now? It'd be great if you were.""

Z: ""Nah, I'm just planning for a zombie apocalypse, like I have in real life. Would you be ready if the dead rose? Probably not.""

Steve: ""... What do you mean, prepared in real life?""

Z: ""Oh, you know. Bought a shotgun, a few swords and the like, stocked food and water in a panic room, bought loads of locks for doors. 2012 is coming up soon, you know. What have you done to prepare?""

Chainsaw: ""... So you're carrying over your own paranoid insanity into the game? That's... actually quite brilliant. What kind of shotgun did you buy?""

Z: ""I'll give you my specs later. For now, we party and mingle with the commoners some more and up guard duty. I figure we can break the news in two days. Give them time to sober up tomorrow, then tell them the day after. We still need to reinforce the city and castle, hand out weapons... rally the remaining blacksmiths and armorers, we need to tell them to get to crafting easy to use weapons. Check up on the nobles, and see what the mages say about anti-undead and anti-magic wards and the like.""

A few hours later, everyone had come back after conversing with whoever they were sent to, and the blacksmiths had been brought. But there were a few bad news bears.

Steve: ""The nobles you sent me to? Their house was completely abandoned, save for a few servants and guards.""

Chainsaw: ""So was mine.""

Heidi: ""And mine.""

Jay: ""Mine were all still there and were keeping a constant vigil.""

The dudes I was sent to were still there as well, and had been recruiting more guards for duty and training their servants how to defend themselves.

Z: ""So three families have fled. We have five ones still here. Better than nothing. Gandalf said all of that stuff is certainly possible, but we'd have to start very soon. We'll have some of the guards clear out the empty houses and the servants reinforce them and stock them with resources. They'll be used as strongholds in case they get farther in and training areas until they're needed. But for now, put together a huge party in the bazaar, and make sure everyone knows that they're invited.""

Jay: ""We should send word to the noble families to come out and talk to people as well. We're all the same when it's war. We should work on reinforcing the castle as well as we can as well; it'll be a last bastion in case they make it that far.""

Steve: ""The Lich will probably be in the middle or back of the group, or even out of the battle entirely until they get the upper hand. Which is good, since we won't have to worry about everyone dying in the first hour.""

Heidi: ""I'll go gather the holy men of the city and have them consecrate everything they can, and maybe even bless armor and weapons if we have the time.""

Chainsaw: ""I'll take care of overseeing training. Maybe teach them some Paladin techniques if I can. The more Holy magic we can use, the better.""

Z: ""Solid ideas. I'll call up Gandalf and see if he can teach some people basic magic. Fireballs and stuff. Not to be sexist, but we should probably get women on magic duty and men on melee. Makes more sense.""

Everyone started working on their plans while criers informed everyone possible about the celebration. Most of the city turned up, and between us, we probably talked to at least half of the people, even annoying kids. Tried to get on a first name basis and everything. The Nobles covered a fair amount of ground as well, most likely making this the most successful celebration yet. We prepared all day the next day, and then the second day came. Criers made sure everyone knew about the speech, and the whole city showed up, even the delinquents.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_14n9vh,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14n9vh/stealing_immortality_part_7/,

1355276359.0,328,self.DnD,14p6z1,"Stealing Immortality, Part Nine",,446,118,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14p6z1/stealing_immortality_part_nine/,"Hello, people or r/DnD! I am back and I smell like Lavender Mint. It's fantastic, really. Anyway, my scents have absolutely nothing to do with the story! Because people were so anxious for part nine, I decided that I'd do it tonight instead of tomorrow.

When we last left off, the Lich's assault on the city had begun! We had successfully trained the people to defend themselves to the point where between them and the army, we didn't have to worry about them and could focus entirely on the Lich, who had come straight to the castle to engage us. We had caused a large amount of damage to the Lich while suffering few casualties on our part, and then the Lich decided that he'd had enough and decided to turn the tables on us. Big time.

Chris: ""The Lich roars in anger as blue flames explode outwards from him, forming what look like tentacles of pure flame coming from his back. His hands begin to glow a golden color as he turns to all of you, one at a time, and casts a spell that warps space and time for you, along with Gandalf. When the warp is over, you stand up and look around to find yourselves in a massive labyrinth.""

Z: ""... Did you... maze us? Are you fucking serious? We were doing *so well!* And then you drop this on us. Great. I thought we were done with the spontaneous screwing over?""

Chris: ""Well, I was inspired to make my own contingency plans after seeing the six of you make your own. Isn't that fair?""

Z: ""Goddammit. What's the labyrinth look like?""

Chris: ""Exactly like the one from the movie Labyrinth. Stone walls about 12-15 feet high. Behind you is a path that leads to a seemingly endless desert with a ranging sandstorm right in the middle of it. The left corridor extends for miles. The path ahead of you forks off in three directions.""

Steve: ""Dude, this is cruel. Like, worse than having to chop off Chainsaw's leg, forcing us to smelt down the stuff from the tower, and screwing us over with the whole Stygia thing. Why do you do these things to us?""

Chris: ""Because you were winning too easily. I had to do something to challenge you.""

Chainsaw: ""So you maze us? You bastard.""

Jay: ""*Deep sigh.* Alright, let's just try to get through this as fast as possible. Can we lift someone on top of the walls?""

Chris: ""Yeah, I suppose.""

Jay: ""Alright. Z, get over here. You're going up.""

Chris: ""They lift you up to the top of the walls. As you pull yourself up, you look around and see an endless maze. There is a clearing in the center, and a tower on the other side. The top of the keep glows with a familiar blue color.""

Z: ""Figures. I'll relay the information and call everyone to get up here. How far are the gaps between the walls?""

Chris: ""Far enough that you'll be making checks every time.""

Heidi: ""Could we map it out so we'd know which way we were going?""

Chainsaw: ""Labyrinths are constantly changing. Remember how much David Bowie was screwing with Sarah in the movie? Mapping it out would take an absurdly long time, and something would change that would drop us into a gelatinous cube pit or something."" 

Heidi: ""Shit, you're right... Can I cast Fly on the group so that we can just fly to the other side?""

Chris: ""I didn't think of that... dammit. Alright, you cast your spell and everyone in the group can fly. When you make it to the clearing in the center, you begin to descend no matter how hard you try to stay in the air.""

Z: ""I wanna aim my descent so that I land on one of the walls.""

Chris: ""Alright, you do that. Everyone else is on the ground in the clearing. In the center is a group of statues, all holding different masks up to their faces and pointing towards an exit.""

Jay: ""Oh boy. It's riddle time, isn't it? I'll walk over there and try to climb up the statues so that I can stand on one's head or something like that. All Assassin's Creed-like.""

Chris: ""As you climb up the statues, one of them lowers his mask to reveal a face of pure ire. He turns and slaps you off. After he does this, he puts his mask back on.""

Heidi: ""What kind of mask is he wearing? What masks are all of the statues wearing?""

Chris: ""The statue that bitch-slapped Jay has a happy jester's mask on. Going clockwise, the other ones have a masquerade mask with what looks like a beak, one has a frowning jester's mask, the next has a mask with swirly patterns all around, the one next to that has a neutral jester's mask, and the last one has a zombie mask.""

Steve: ""So every other statue is a jester mask. Hmmm. Can we leave this area of the maze?""

Chris: ""Fun time. As you walk towards one of the exits, a huge slab of stone raises, blocking your path. The statue pointing in that direction, the zombie one, becomes animate and steps down from the pedestal. Roll initiative.""

Z: ""Fuck that noise. Guys, get over here. I'm pulling you all up here and we're nope-ing the hell out of here.""

Jay: ""Yeah, I like that idea. Let's get going.""

Chris: ""As you run towards the wall, it begins getting higher and higher until it's about 45 feet high.""

Chainsaw: ""Grappling hook.""

Z: ""Animate rope to bring the grappling hook up here. I ain't dealing with this.""

Chris: ""Dammit... you pull the rope up and secure the hook. Who's going up first?""

Heidi: ""Send Gandalf up. Chainsaw should probably go last since he could probably catch anyone that falls.""

Z: ""I'm gonna try and use a Hold spell on the statue to slow it down.""

Chris: ""Well, make your roll for it.""

He landed a natural 20, successfully holding it, giving us plenty of time to get up the rope. Or so we thought. After Chainsaw got up with the rest of us, the rest of the statues animated and proceeded to punch hand holds into the wall and start climbing.

Z: ""NOPE. You guys can screw around with the golems if you want, I'm headed to the tower. I'm gonna sing something that increases agility so we can make the jumps more easily. It's gonna be Magic Dance by David Bowie since we're stealing everything from Labyrinth. I need backup singers on this one. Volunteers?""

Steve: ""Totally. Time to rock out, man.""

And so they sang Magic Dance, and Z even managed to sound quite a bit like Bowie, which was impressive.

Z: ""Can I sing it so that when he says, ""Jump magic, jump"" we're jumping across the gaps? We should totally get a bigger bonus if I can.""

Chris: ""You can try, but there will be times where you won't be at the chorus when jumps come up. And yes, you can have a bigger bonus when you do.""

Z: ""In hindsight, Jump by Van Halen might have been a better choice. But this is much more entertaining.""

Steve: ""Damn right it is. Van Halen's great, but this is far more fun. Bowie's awesome, too.""

They ended up singing the full song (About 5 minutes long) twice before we were fairly close. We had rolled about 30 or so jump checks. We weren't going to screw around running in circles in the maze, and even Gandalf was making his rolls. Heidi had used Fox's Agility or whatever buff Clerics have to increase agility on the group at some point, so we were flying through this place, and having loads of fun singing. Here's the scene if anyone hasn't seen it, and you should be able to find the full one in the related videos: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvyNOg4jSRg

Eventually we had made it to the tower on the other side of the labyrinth. We hopped off of the walls in front of the tower and prepared ourselves for a hell of a fight. We kicked down the front door and stormed up the stairs, eventually reaching the top, where the Lich had been waiting for us in a throne of fire.

Lich: ""So, you've come.""

Z: ""Well, we didn't exactly have anywhere else, you know. It was either here or dick around in the desert.""

Lich: ""And you're against me as well, old friend?""

Gandalf: ""Naturally. You've gone too far, and have become a monster. You must be purged from the world.""

Chainsaw: ""If you're so confident in the fact that you're going to win, could you at least honestly tell us the state of the city?""

Lich: ""I suppose that's fair. Your people were well prepared. My minions have done nothing but fail me. Naturally, if I returned, the city would be laid to waste. But I'll be merciful and let them all live; you've been through a lot to get here.""

Heidi: ""Well, let's get this over with. We've got a city to run, you know. Can't spend all day screwing around here.""

Lich: ""Speaking of the day, how did you manage to get here so quickly? It should have taken you at least the better part of a day, yet you made is here in a few hours.""

Z: ""Oh, we cheated. Ran along the walls. You probably should have done something about that. Silly Lich, playing fair is for lawful types. If it can be exploited, then it will be. You should have figured this out by now. We're cheating bastards.""

Lich: ""And so you are... no matter, your end is here and now. Make your peace, heroes. Your time is about to end.""

Before we could even pick up our dice, Gandalf stopped us to talk to him.

Gandalf: ""You may think yourself infallible, but you're just as much of a fool as you were when you began dabbling. There is no magic that cannot be dispelled, my friend.""

And with that, Gandalf pulled out a knife and gutted himself. Nobody was expecting this at all; we figured we were just going to have an awesome fight, but here Chris was, preventing us from doing so. Jaws dropped all around the table as we were told what was happening.

Chris: ""After gutting himself, blood rushed from the wound and began to form a ritual circle on the floor. Huge waves of blood send all of you flying into walls, even the Lich. Tendrils of blood sprout from the ground and began forming into ritual objects. Pure magical energy sprouts up from the ground and spirals around him. It infuses with his blood and fires like a cannon at the Lich. The Lich is quite literally torn apart, and a deafening scream emanates from where the Lich once stood, and a huge soul escapes from the end of the cannon of magic and blood. After this happens, Gandalf doubles over and falls to the ground, dead.""

Everyone was silent. Chris had been out to end us for quite a while now, and he had just ended possibly the most powerful villain he had ever created himself. We all looked at each other, unsure of what to say. Eventually, Z spoke up.

Z: ""Uhhh... can we resurrect him? Somebody has True Resurrection, right?""

Chris: ""Gandalf gave his very soul to eliminate the Lich. There is no way to resurrect him by any normal means.""

Z: ""He gave his soul... where do souls usually go? Some kind of vortex somewhere? Another plane? What?""

Chris: ""His soul has been destroyed forever. The spell tore it apart.""

Heidi: ""I still have two wishes. Could I wish for his soul to be reformed and return to his body?""

Chris: ""No.""

Z: ""Well, let's take his body back, stitch it up, and preserve it so it doesn't rot.""

Steve: ""Why do you want to preserve it? We should give him a proper burial.""

Z: ""Because we're gonna go call down a God and get some divine intervention. Gods are all-powerful. They could restore a soul, no questions asked.""

We all agreed that this was a good idea if we wanted our main man back, so we grabbed his body and teleported back to the city.

The undead had fallen when the Lich had been slain, so all that remained was for the city to be cleaned up. We called the survivors (which there were many of, we didn't have many casualties at all) to the plaza in front of the castle to give a speech about how Gandalf had given his life to end the Lich, and declared that today to be a holiday celebrating our triumph over the undead hordes and in memory of Gandalf.

Afterwards, we headed to the throne room and slumped into our chairs after preserving Gandalf and making the Lich's prison into a shrine dedicated to him.

Chainsaw: ""So you want to call a God to work a miracle on him?""

Z: ""That's the idea.""

Steve: ""How do you plan on doing that?""

Z: ""Not sure yet.""

Steve: ""What if they refuse?""

Z: ""Then we'll kill them and take everything. Their powers, their place in whatever Pantheon they may have. We'll go on a God-slaying rampage if we have to. We'll steal their immortality.""

... And with that, part nine ends. Everyone at the table gave him a look that said something like, ""That was possibly the greatest thing you've ever said."" I'm going to take a break for a bit so you guys can stew in the events of part nine and grasp how epic things were. At least they were to us.

*Must give credit where credit is due, inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1cfob1/my_custom_gaming_table/)post.  Without seeing that my group would never have thought of putting this bad boy together.* 

One member of my group spent the better part of 5 hours building this and moving it down to his basement.  The surface is made so that we can use dry-erase markers on it, which is amazing for note taking and marking different enemies and pc's.  

LED's run around the entire inside, and on both undersides of the table.    The color changes of the LED's made for great mood settings.

We have a projector mounted to the ceiling that shines down on the table, with a computer hooked up to it.  We use [D20Pro](http://d20pro.com/) (a fantastic product that I would encourage anyone to use) and I DM from my laptop.  Each player has a miniature that they use, but the software also has their images under each mini. 

*EDIT
I had some questions about the price of putting this table together so I asked my friend to give me a rundown of the cost of materials, not the cheapest thing ever.

* LED’s = $50 (two strands of 16.4 lights with controller)
* Wood = $75-$150
* Granite Tile = $40 (Might be able to take back the extra I didn’t use)
* Wood Screws/nuts/bolts = $15
* Caulk (gluing down tiles and then grey color for grout and white for melamine boarder) =$25
* Melamine board =$20

Yes, ever since part one, the name has never really been relevant at all, but it will be soon, even though I've said that since part four!

When we last left off, the group had gained the trust of the people, who were willing to fight for their homes. They had been trained, geared, and were ready for war. The legions of undead were spotted standing at the horizon, waiting for the word to charge. Generals had been recruited to lead various forces and direct the people should things get nasty, and we were standing on top of the castle awaiting the Lich, since he was sure to come straight for us.

Steve: ""This is awesome. We might get screwed over, but it's still awesome. We'll be heroes n' stuff.""

Jay: ""Yup yup. But with great power comes great responsibility.""

Z: ""Uncle Ben! You're back from the dead!""

Jay: ""Shut up, you.""

As they bickered and bullshitted with each other, Gandalf showed up behind us to inform us that it had begun.""

Z: ""Sound the alarms! Do we have any alarms? Sound them if we do. If we don't, blow some horns or ring some bells.""

Chainsaw: ""Did Gandalf get those wards in place?""

Chris: ""Yes, the mages worked day and night to place the wards.""

Steve: ""Are the zombies going to explode when they run into them or something? Or is it just going to make some sort of barrier?""

Chris: ""Gandalf set up barriers outside the city and along the streets at choke points, and explosive runes that will activate when the undead get close enough.""

Steve: ""Nice. How far do you think the undead themselves will get? We know the Lich will probably just do his thing and come right up here, but what about the zombies?""

Chris: ""Well, the citizens have taken crash courses in their respective fields, and can take care of themselves fairly well. If they fight hard and are supported by the army, they shouldn't have much trouble with the zombies.""

Chainsaw: ""What if there's other things, like zombies on horseback or other ones riding skeletal eagles or something? We don't have a cavalry, do we? Do we have pikemen?""

Z: ""Somewhere, I think. The archers and mages should know to knock them out of the sky and support the dudes on the ground if there's cavalry. They're not stupid. I think.""

Chris: ""As the horde rushes towards the city, you can see them running into an invisible barrier about 300 yards away from the city. The barrier will hold them for about a minute and a half.""

Jay: ""Good God, that's some powerful magic to hold of thousands of undead. Gandalf's pretty awesome.""

Z: ""Well, yeah. He blew a dude up into bits of spam. Do the archers have the sense to fire?""

Chris: ""Naturally, and they do so. As they go down, you can see members of the undead legion far larger than the ones that are being taken out lumbering onto the field. Seemingly unaffected by normal arrows, they begin to smash on the shield, which is rapidly deteriorating.""

Steve: ""Don't we have barrels of oil and torches for the archers to dip their arrowheads in and light?""

Chris: ""Indeed you do. The hulking zombies are hit by the arrows and ignite and burn out before they have time to get to the second barrier. More hulking zombies are moving among the ranks to get to the second barrier.""

Jay: ""Catapults?""

Chainsaw: ""Naturally.""

Chris: ""The catapults launch burning stones into the field, causing havoc among the mindless dead. The navy begins to fire bolts from the shore, eliminating even more.""

Heidi: ""This is going far too well. What's the estimated kill count?""

Chris: ""Probably around 1200 altogether. You're right to question it, as the legions have picked up massive slabs of wood to carry over themselves, nullifying the effect of arrows. You hear a loud scream as the lesser members of the hordes are shoved aside by fast-moving wights. They break their way through the second barrier and begin heading towards the gates.""

Z: ""And so the barricades were set on fire.""

Chris: ""And they were. The wights reach the barricade and are stopped dead in their tracks by the massive wall of fire. Some are not so quick, and are impaled on the wall and begin burning.""

Steve: ""That is so cool. We've got this. Can we attach flasks of oil to the arrows the archers are firing and shoot them at the slabs of wood to make them more easy to burn?""

Chris: ""I hadn't thought of that... clever idea. I'll let you do it. Takes the concentrated fire of at least ten archers to pull it off.""

Chainsaw: ""Good God, how big are these shields?""

Chris: ""About 25' by 25' and at least 6-8 inches thick. After taking a few of the shields down and causing more trouble for the undead, skeletal archers walk over the hill and begin firing into the city.""

Z: ""That's fine, everyone's inside until they get into the city and the archers have a roof over their heads and are firing from murder holes, right? They'll have to be fairly accurate if they want to hit the archers.""

Chris: ""And that they are not. Behind them, though comes several groups of skeletal mages come up and begin launching bolts of frost at the barricades, extinguishing the barricade, and begin aiming for the murder holes of the archers with fireballs once the barricades are no longer burning. The hulking dead smash through the barricade and begin slamming against the doors of the city.""

Jay: ""And so it begins... bring out the militia into the street and have the mages and archers position themselves on rooftops and in windows. Are the skeletal archers firing in an arc, or towards the walls and trying to nail the archers?""

Chris: ""Still at the archers. Very few casualties among the archers have happened, as they've been able to avoid the fireballs.""

Jay: ""Have them put sheets of iron in front of the murder holes to avoid and more fire and get ready to shoot at the undead coming through the gates.""

Heidi: ""Did we ever to consecrate the place? I could have sworn we had the gates blessed and whatnot.""

Chris: ""That never happened, but large vats of holy water that can be poured into the street have been set up on rooftops, and the militia were armed with flasks of holy water.""

Z: ""So they have holy hand grenades? That's awesome. Do we have any holy weapons?""

Chris: ""The strongest members of the army that are farther into the city have blessed weapons, yes. Some shields with spikes on the front were also blessed.""

Chainsaw: ""This is so cool. We should take over cities and do things like this more often.""

Heidi: ""Wouldn't murdering a political leader and taking his place be considered an act of extreme evil? And then we'd have loyalists on our hands and whatnot.""

Chainsaw: ""Details. Do we see the Lich yet?""

Chris: ""About time somebody asked that. From the edge of the horizon, you can see the Lich slowly advancing, surrounded by a battalion of knights on horseback. Since you last saw him, he has doubled in size, and his eyes now burn bright blue and are visible from a great distance. The land that he steps on begins to wither and die rapidly; grass dies, soil becomes unable to support plant life, and flowers wilt. With a wave of his hand, the cavalry begins to charge. He walks in a bit farther before he begins to float, and eventually starts flying towards the castle, leaving a trail of frost behind him.""

Jay: ""Ahhh, goddammit... are the archers and mages smart enough to make the cavalry a priority?""

Chris: ""Naturally. The Lich gets closer and closer, eventually floating just 30 yards or so away from you at eye level. He has since gained the ability to speak, and begins doing so as he pulls a small box out from his robes. He speaks in a chilling voice that sends shivers down your spine.""

Lich: ""Is *this* what you were looking for? You can have it. I don't need it anymore. I have ascended to a level beyond comprehension. I have joined the Gods!""

Chris: ""The Lich then proceeds to crush the box in his hand, and throws the broken remains at your feet. His hands begin to burn with blue fire as he stretches, causing his bones to crack.""

Z: ""Set up the A/M and anti-undead wards, have the archers fire their A/M arrows, and have Gandalf and the mages get ready to toss fireballs at him once he's distracted with us. Bring a battalion of our best warriors up the stairs. We'll have him from three angles. Granted he can still fly, but between us, Gandalf, the archers, and the soldiers, we'll have quite the advantage.""

Chris: ""Jay was right. Hearing this kind of planning from you is really, really weird. Anyways, the mages activate the wards while the Lich flies towards you. It bumps into them and is knocked back. He reaches forward to touch it, and begins to laugh.""

Lich: ""You really think *this* can stop *me?* You're a bunch of right fools. I'm impressed you've survived this long.""

The Lich proceeded to toss several bolts of lightning and fire at the ward, which bounced right off. The Lich was shocked.

Lich: ""What is this sorcery?! I have reached Godhood!""

Gandalf walked up the stairs, chuckling.

Gandalf: ""I put that one up myself. You'll have a hard time with that one, old friend.""

The group's jaws dropped and their faces went pale at the thought of Gandalf possibly being another Lich.

Z: ""Say what now?""

Gandalf: ""Yes, he and myself were once friends. We studied forbidden magics in the deepest recesses of a winding series of caves of the White Peaks. After many years of dabbling in such arts, he became obsessed with power, and was never satisfied with what he had. After 33 years, he had gone completely mad. He began the ritual to trade his morality for the powers of a Lich one day, and I fled. Looking back on it, I should have stopped him before he finished, but now I have the chance to end his madness by your side.""

Z: ""Best be joking, Gandalf. That's some serious shit, man. Didn't you try to track him down?""

Gandalf: ""I did. I learned he had been enslaved by a Necromancer, the same one you killed not long ago. I laughed at his misfortune and decided my life would be better spent teaching students in the magical arts, and to never touch such ancient magic again. When you told me of the Necromancer and the Liches, I suspected that he was one of them. But I never thought he would be the one to assault the city... even though he was quite powerful, many Liches are ancient beings from a time long passed. When you slew the Necromancer, his control over the Liches must have faded.""

Lich: ""Hmph. You time ends now, old man. Your walls cannot stop me forever... Heroes, look upon your city. Do you see the havoc caused by my minions? Your people never stood a chance. And soon, we will encroach upon your castle. Make peace with your Gods, fools.""

Jay: ""Yeah, I'm gonna check for deception. Everyone should. Can we get Gandalf to as well? It's probably some kind of hallucination.""

We all rolled, and Heidi managed a 20 somehow.

Chris: ""You look closely at the city and notice buildings warping and fires that are not spreading. The images shown to you by the Lich are clearly hallucinations.""

Heidi: ""Yeah, it's a fake. Can I try to cast Hold Undead on him?""

Chris: ""Nope. That's like trying to cast Hold Person on a Demigod. It won't work unless you have some kind of crazy luck, and even then they might be immune. Like this Lich is.""

Heidi: ""Shit. Can we signal the archers to start firing, since the Lich is set on trying to fool us? They should get the jump on him, right?""

Chris: ""Indeed you can. The master archers you selected peek out from behind the arrow slits of the keeps on the side of the castle and unleash a barrage of arrows at the Lich. Several of them hit, and an expression of pain runs across the remains of his face as he starts to descend. You hear a loud growl as he disappears from view, and then see a huge explosion of blue flames come from below. The wards fade and the Lich returns to where he was before, completely cloaked in flame.""

Lich: ""Enough! This ends now. Lay down your weapons, and I'll end you quickly.""

Chainsaw: ""Not a chance. Let's do it.""",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_14ogiq,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14ogiq/stealing_immortality_part_eight/,

All that changed this week.

3.5
I'm playing a 3rd lvl human swashbuckler who's feats are used up being proficient in the exotic spiked chain. Unfortunately we've spent the short campaign as prisoners and haven't had much choice. 
The party was forced (no we couldn't escape, only option death) to compete in an Alabaster Cup sporting event representing the rich cunt who happens to own us. The competitors were comprised of us slaves and an equal amount of npcs who are wealthy athletes that are here voluntarily due to its prestige and prize. 
Anyways the final days event was a royal rumble style melee (last to yield or be knocked out wins) with real weapons. During the fight we are ganging up on this noble dude from some bullshit rich family. Our lady barbarian has beaten him ragged. Having knocked out 2 npcs I really wanted to make the hat trick so on my turn I ran up behind him and attack with my spiked chain. Now here I have to admit that I was feeling quite the D&amp;D bloodlust. I haven't fought or killed a thing yet, I am hating being a prisoner and being forced to compete in these bullshit events just rolling dice. My character is a poor gypsy whose people are being oppressed by wealthy fucks like this.
So before I roll to attack I say, ""I aim for his throat. The gap in his armor.""
Natural 20.
""Roll to confirm""
18 plus stuff.
""Roll damage""
More than enough to finish him.
My spiked chain wraps around his throat and tightens, both strangling and slicing it open. The crowd gasps and we can hear his family in the stands screaming and crying. The competitor drops to his knees, blood spraying out in every direction, and slumps to the ground making a death gurgle. I say to our DM, ""I look to his family in the audience and I shrug like ""oops"" and grin"". He tells me that they wail in agony.
Right then the rogue in our party decides she wants to win and is disgusted by this murder. So she attacks me, does a little damage. I decide to fight back but on my turn my chain is stuck in this dude's neck. 
""I guess I yank on it as hard as I can,"" 
Natural 20
Head pops right off and the audience gasps again. Women and children cry and cover their eyes. His family members faint and vomit. I look to the rogue and grin whilst attacking.
My Character ends up winning the entire Alabaster Cup and the people have to honor me despite being a vicious killer. How fun. I won. The end.

It's just cute to see people do things that I would never think to do.

In the second part of the game, I decided to make a simple challenge.  Basic kobold thief tries to steal some cloth so he can give tribute to Tiamat.  Whatever, its easy and gets some character development.  But I soon realized they had never seen a kobold before.  And thus began the 2 hour ordeal where the group of 5 level 2's tried to deal with Saug, the nasty kobold commoner.

First they tried to reason with it.  But Saug really needed this cloth.  If he didn't, he would lose his position of doomwailer and would be yelled at, told how his life is worthless, and beaten by his superiors (Instead of being yelled at and being told how his life is worthless).  When that didn't work, so they tried to intimidate him.  All 5 try, but Saug has a swagger and it doesn't work.  ""Saug is victorious""!  After saying that a few times, and being asked by a PC if the PC will have to hit Saug, Saug replies ""Saug not used to choice"".

It devolved from there, with them trying everything to figure out what's going on and began to submit to his demands.  They gave him horse feed, made him a cape out of a tent, painted him a picture, ext.  After time went by, the more fighty people got bored.  So they encountered three kobold guards and a guard dog.  Seeing his chance, Saug took action as well.

The psion and monk were taken down in the first round thanks to some lucky rolls on my part.  Saug picked up a rock and hits the bard who was guarding him.  Double critical.  ""Saug is victorious.""  Dammit, Saug is victorious.

The fighter sees this all fall down and panics.  He had wanted to fight, but now he didn't.  He tries to surrender.  He drops his sword.  And his shield.  And tells them they can even have his full plate if they let him live.  The binder sees this and decides to surrender as well.  Fast forward, and now the party has been enslaved by kobolds.  23 of them, to be exact.

After talking to them in a post-game discussion, I learned that

* They are too afraid to strike against their new masters and are willing to work in the coal mines,
* They enjoyed the game, and
* They think I planed for this",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_194x4a,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/194x4a/saug_is_victorious_i_love_new_players_gaming_story/,

http://imgur.com/a/Wtp7S

I've been working on this castle for the last four months or so. I originally started it as a side project just for fun, but soon decided it would have to become the stage for an epic campaign. It is based on the Sarwin Castle from the 3.5 campaign The Thunder Below.

A few facts about the castle:

* In total it measures 2' wide, 3' long, and 1'2"" tall.
* I used molds from Hirst Arts to make each individual brick before assembling the castle. The castle is made up of more than 5,000 bricks.
* The material cost for the Castle is fairly low: 50 lbs of Plaster of Paris, Paint, brushes, and some Polyurethane. Maybe $40 in total.
* The cost of Molds, Silicone (to make my own molds), A shelf to store the supplies, the mass of plastic ware to hold the bricks, and other items cost around $250. Luckily all that can be reused.

In total I spent around 400 hours on this project. That's every episode of Stargate (SG1, Atlantis, and Universe), Six seasons of Doctor Who, Six Seasons of Psych, and a ton of other movies.

I still have some work to do. I have grass and shrubs to decorate the outside of the castle. I need to build doors and stairs in the castle. And if I'm still interested by that point, I will start putting in the furniture / decorations.

Otherwise I'll go on to building something new.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_1feywy,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1feywy/my_castle_is_finally_built_and_ready_to_play/,

The other ones I posted got some upvotes, but Stealing Immortality seems to be a favorite. It'll be hard to top this one when it's over. Maybe I'll try and stretch is out a bit for you guys.

Just a heads up: There's a lot of fudging that goes on, and some incredibly cruel things on Chris' part. By the time some of this happened, we were incredibly tired or intoxicated, so stuff made sense at the time. Thinking about it, I'm not sure how it worked, but when there's enough alcohol and you haven't slept in a while, anything goes. So bear with me and try your hardest not to call out things that don't make sense. Feel free to correct anything major, though.

And I promise that while it might seem like mindless fighting and quick thinking at the moment, it does come to a climax where immortality does actually come into question, and is in fact stolen.

When we last left off, Z had returned from The Abyss with a Deck of Many Things when he pulled The Fates card. The two Liches had absorbed the power from the two seemingly dead Liches after what were believed to be their Phylacteries had been destroyed. We had all agreed that there wasn't much of a choice other than to pull cards from the Deck, since we were pretty much powerless against these Liches. It'd take a miracle and a half to down them the traditional way, and even then they'd still be alive. Chainsaw had given Z all of his stuff in case he pulled the Ruins card, which makes all of your non-magic gear disappear permanently.

Chainsaw had said that he was going to pull cards while he had the chance, and began as soon as the deck was ready. His first card was an incredibly fortunate pick; the Knight. The Knight summons a Fighter equivalent to your level that will serve you loyally until death. Chainsaw commanded him to taunt the Liches away from the group and dodge everything he could in an attempt to keep them distracted.

Then he pulled his second card, which was the Vizier. The Vizier causes the character to learn the answer to one question upon request. Before he could say anything, everyone yelled at him to be specific about his question. He obeyed and asked where the phylacteries of the two Liches we were currently fighting were. Chris grinned as he told us; ""your phylactery is in another tower."" He showed Chainsaw a vision of the tower's location and how to get there and disappeared.

Silence all around. Chris seemed quite pleased with himself. Chainsaw relayed how to get to the tower.

Steve: ""The fuck do you mean, it's on the Astral Plane?!""

Chainsaw: ""I mean it's on the Astral Plane.""

Jay: ""You saw how to get there, right? We just need to find the portal or whatever to take us there.""

Chainsaw: ""The portal I saw was the one on that side of the room.""

Z: ""That goes to the Abyss. No way am I going in there. And what are we going to do about the Liches? They've got us pinned down, and the Fighter's only going to live so long. We can't outrun them. They'll follow us wherever; they've got nothing better to do.""

Steve: ""Yeah, I imagine they have scrying spells or something. They'll see us wherever we go. Nowhere to hide. Anywhere.""

Heidi: ""Well, we still have the deck. How many cards are in it? We've pulled three, right?""

Z: ""I'm pretty sure the number of cards left depends on the person drawing from it. So I have 17, and Chainsaw has 16. Everyone else still has 18. At least I think that's how it works.""

We ended up rolling with the individual draws. Then we remembered that we were in combat.

Chainsaw's Fighter had tried to stab one of the Liches and missed, but had its attention. He ran behind pillars, bookcases, and anything else in the room to avoid its absurdly powerful spells.

Jay: ""Alright, there's only one. What we do have?""

Heidi: ""Well, my goddess returned my abilities after seeing that we were going to get thrashed if she didn't."" Chris had fudged that one, but we were fine with it. We were going to need them.

Z: ""I was using my songs and Bardic stuff. I still have the spells I didn't use on the way up.""

Steve: ""How many was that?""

Z: ""A lot, actually. I can use my songs as often as I want, assuming I'm not distracted. I didn't really use much on the way up... huh.

Jay: ""Awesome. Look up your most powerful stuff, and get ready to bomb them with it. Give me your song sheet, I'll try and figure out what's useful here.""

Z: ""I've got Hold Monster. Enough time to set ourselves up assuming the Fighter can keep the other one busy.""

Jay: ""Perfect. Fantastic. Do that as soon as you can.""

A plan was hatched. However, the non-distracted Lich had its turn before us. And good God was it determined to do whatever it could. Since its powers had been restored, it had Prismatic Spray available again. And with no Bard song bonuses, this was going to be a difficult save. 

Jay got hit with the green beam. Instant death by poisoning. But he managed to save against it and took constitution damage instead. Lucky bastard. Z got hit by two red beams, nailing him for a total of 40 damage. Not too big of a deal. Steve was nailed with a blue beam, which turned him to stone. Well, shit. One dude down. Chainsaw managed to save vs. Insanity and took 40 damage. Once again, not that big a deal. Heidi managed to save against everything she could, taking only 20 points of damage. But that wasn't it.

Our loyal knight was nailed by the Indigo beam and Yellow beam. Yellow does 80 points of damage. Indigo drives you insane. Failed both. Now we have a fighter in the corner babbling nonsense and playing with his nipples while giving off electric discharge. The Lich finished him off and turned to us.

Steve: ""So, ideas?""

Z: ""Well, I can unstone Jay. But that leaves a Lich able to do stuff.""

Heidi: ""Use your turn to drag Jay over here. If we're touching each other, we'll be teleported back to the church of the first town we were in.""

Steve: ""Would the Liches be able to teleport there? They *are* level 20+ Wizards that can do basically everything.""

Jay: ""Well, they'd have to do some kind of scrying to find us. And they know what we look like, and might have some kind of extended knowledge about us since they're all magic and shit.""

Z: ""We could always pull more cards.""

Heidi: ""We're not screwing around with the cards anymore. At least not now. Too much on the line. Let's just do the teleporting thing since we're screwed if we don't.""

We all eventually agreed, brought all of our stuff towards Heidi, and wound up in the middle of a church during a sermon. Awkward stuff. Four beat up people and a statue magically appearing in the room. Not something that happens every day. We got Jay unstoned, healed up at the inn, and got to planning.

Jay: ""Alright. We have two superpowered Liches following us. What can we do to throw them off our tracks.""

Z: ""Deck of Many Things!""

Jay: ""If you want to pull from the deck, by all means. But I'm not taking responsibility for your drooling comatose body if you pull the Void. And we don't have time to get your soul right now.""

Z: ""You know, that Fighter would have been awesome if he was still alive. We could have commanded him to draw from the deck until we got something good, then have him use it however we wanted.""

Steve: ""What if we hired mercenaries to draw from the deck or something? There's that one card that lets you make wishes.""

Z: ""If you had that kind of power, would you *really* use it how you were told to?""

Steve: ""Fair point. What if we charmed someone into it? You're a Bard, you're hot. Go get a barmaid to do whatever you want.""

Z: ""Don't you know anything? Barmaids are always succubi. Play more games, fool.""

Steve: ""Then splash some holy water during foreplay or something. Or get her to shove a holy symbol up her hoo-hah. That'd be hilarious. Having a succubus fry her own uterus with a cross. Oh, God.""

Z: ""That's brilliant, but do we have the time? I mean, seriously. This isn't a club where you pick up chicks that are so easy you can use the Jedi mind trick on them.""

Chainsaw: ""Well you're wasting time by arguing it. Go sing her a song and get her up here to pull cards.""

Z: ""The things I do...""

Heidi: ""Oh, please. You would have done it already if you thought of it.""

Z: ""Fair enough. I'm gonna go seduce a barmaid and use her to pull cards from the deck.""

Chris: ""They have to be willing.""

Z: ""I'm making her willing. And then telling her what to do.""

Chris: ""So you're mind-raping her? I don't know if you can do that. Even if you can, that's kind of messed up, so I'm not letting you do that.""

Steve: ""Chainsaw, the Vizier said the Astral Plane, right? That doesn't make any sense. The Astral Plane is essentially space. It can't be on the Astral Plane. There's nothing there.""

Chris: ""Dammit, you're right... The tower isn't on the Astral Plane. It's in one of the Outer Planes, The Gray Waste.""

Chainsaw: ""So we get to beat up Hades?""

Jay: ""No, we're going to avoid Hades to the best of our ability.""

Chainsaw: ""But how did he get there? You wound up in the Abyss when you jumped through his portal.""

Z: ""I don't know, man. Maybe there was a way to get there from his little platform things and I stomped on him like a goomba before he made it there.""

Steve: ""Let's start with getting to the Outer Planes. We'll work our way to the Gray Waste once we're there. We need to find a Wizard that has this kind of knowledge.""

Z: ""We could ask the drunken idiots at the bar and get nowhere. Or we could be daring and use the Deck. The Moon and the Vizier, and possibly Fates. Anybody?""

Jay: ""You're insane, you know. *Sigh.* I suppose I'll pull cards. Moon, Vizier, or Fates. Let's do it.""

He announced that he'd pull one card after relinquishing all of his possessions. Flames. Causes enmity between the character and an Outsider.

Jay: ""You know, this is why I hate you sometimes.""

Z: ""Could we interrogate the Outsider, whenever it comes? Maybe we could force it to take us back to the Planes, since it's connected to them, right?""

Jay: ""That... makes a lot of sense. I never thought I'd say a supportive thing to you that wasn't about your insane plans working. Chris, can we do it?""

Chris: ""Well, first the Outsider needs to find you. And you're still running from the Liches, correct?""

Heidi: ""Oh yeah... we should probably go before they raze the town looking for us. I wouldn't doubt them burning everything to the ground until they find us. They'd probably do it even if they found us by scrying.""

Chainsaw: ""What if we got a priest to cast some kind of ward evil or ward undead spell in a bubble around us? Or use something to prevent scrying and detection?""

Z: ""Then the Outsider won't find us. And that's our key out.""

Jay: ""Well Outsiders aren't necessarily evil. There's just enmity.""

Chris: ""Yeah, you could do that. Something that prevents evil things from detecting you. You'll be in hiding, during this time, but you can do it.""

Z: ""To the church!""

And so we spent four days in the dark basement of a church surrounded by runes. Our only entertainment was an exorcism, and it proved that ""YOUR MOTHER SUCKS COCKS IN HELL"" is still funny, and watching her break and dislocate her own bones to contort into a pretzel was fun.

And then in the middle of the night on day four, a silver-skinned Outsider broke down the door and hurled some kind of magical spear at Jay. The Outsider's aim was garbage, so it stuck in the wall and gave everyone time to get up and beat the crap out of it.

We successfully knocked him out and bound him as well as you can bind something like him. Then we spent for-goddamn-ever interrogating him on getting to the Planes. He revealed that it could be reached with a fairly complex spell that he was nice enough to teach us, after a fun round of torture.

We tossed him into the portal first to make sure he wasn't going to explode into hunks of magical meat upon contact, then held our breath and jumped in afterwards. We found ourselves in The Outlands, the boring area in the middle of the Outer Planes. Here there was nothing to do, and was inhabited by lame things, so we decided to head North to Elysium and find a city.

After seemingly endless walking and Z singing Come Sail Away by Styx to increase our speed, we eventually arrived in Elysium, and found some random city that we spent time restocking in. We had picked up quite a bit of loot in our time, so we sold whatever was useless to us and geared up with new stuff.

Eventually we decided it was time to roll out to the Gray Waste after stocking up on loads of gear. Walking across the Outlands took four days, and with nothing but terrible puns and several new songs from Z, I'm surprised we didn't go insane.

Chris told Chainsaw that the phylacteries were in a tower on the second layer of Hades, Nifhelm.

Chainsaw: ""Seriously, how did he get here? Did he have an endless series of portals? He would have had to go through Carceri to get here and then go down a level just to go to his fancy tower. What was he even doing in our world if he had a tower in Nifhelm? Why does he keep his phylacteries there, of all places? I'm calling serious bullshit on this one.""

Chris: ""No use complaining now.""

After fighting endless hordes of undead and evading the Gods that resided in Hades, Chainsaw pointed out a tower on a cliff that looked out into nothingness. We made our way to it, climbed up the suspiciously empty tower, and made our way to the top.

Chris: ""You know, if you guys were more patient and listened more, you would have known that the portal was attuned to the one in this tower when you said the phrase that the Necromancer told you.""

Everyone's eyes grew to the size of dinner plates as Chris laughed heartily.

Z: ""You said that it opened a hidden cabinet to the right of the portal that had the phylacteries in it! I wrote it down! It's right here, word-for-fucking-word!""

Chris: ""You know, those phials were labeled. When you shifted them around in different patterns, the portal attuned to a different tower. There were patterns on the back, but you cut me off and said you were going to smash the phials on the floor. I was seriously about to read it to you.""

Z: ""You're a dick, you know that?""

Chris: ""Well maybe if you didn't kick him off a floating island to be eaten by devil-spiders he might have enlightened you more.""

Z: ""You told me they were the phylacteries! How was I supposed to know to move the phials around?! What Necromancer puts instructions on the back of a cubby? What, does he have Alzheimer's? Is the next guy going to have extreme Parkinson's and get a bonus to damage for vibrations from his weapon?""

The party was level 8 and consisted of a cleric, a paladin, a fighter/rogue, a cavalier, a ranger, and a conjurer wizard/Loremaster (me!), along with a fighter/sorcerer NPC who we had trust issues with due to him being incredibly evil, but that's a long story... 

We had finally found the hideout of the campaign's villain, the Lord of Shadows. We burst into his chamber, getting a surprise round. I see a large fireplace on the other side of the room, so I immediately cast the fireworks version of Pyrotechnics. *Everyone* in the room failed their save (including the party and even the high-will paladin and cleric) and was blinded for 4 rounds - except me, because I happened to be 12**5** feet away and just out of range.

The villain was alone, so he was clearly quite powerful. On my next two turns I cast Summon Monster 4 and Summon Monster 3; with a feat that gives me extra creatures, I roll well and get 4 Lantern Archons and 4 small Earth Elementals, and they all begin beating on him. He might have been strong, but when blind, anyone can be hit easily. It comes to a total of 8d6 per round from the Archons, and 4d6+28 from the elementals combined.

On the last round of blindness, I cast Burning Disarm (my only damaging spell). He fails his save, but much to my surprise, that damage on top of all the summoned creatures for that round proves to be enough to bring him down. I don't remember how much I rolled, but DM said that I did over 150 damage in total, so... I stood there in shock a moment, then started looting his body. And that's the story of the most anticlimatic boss fight ever!",,False,,t5_2r9ei,1360539134.0,,,True,t3_188yag,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/188yag/today_i_learned_just_how_powerful_wizards_can_be/,

1371414123.0,221,self.DnD,1gh0f1,[Update] Dungeons &amp; Dragons.. for a 4 year old girl,joeflux,262,41,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1gh0f1/update_dungeons_dragons_for_a_4_year_old_girl/,"3 months ago I asked for help for doing Dungeons &amp; Dragons for a 4 year old girl.

Well, her enthusiasm for the game has only increased, and she bugs me all the time to play.   I still haven't read any rulebook for the game, so I'm sure that what we're doing isn't d&amp;d.  We don't even use dice.

As a sample, here's the last game that we played:

She was a fairy that woke up in a underground pool of slime.  She made her way into the dungeons, and came across some scared guards blocking a hall wall.  She sweet talked her way in, entered a large hall, and spoke to a princess.

The princess explained that a dragon had been eating them, and they were all afraid.  My daughter, the fairy, bravely said that she would fight the dragon.  The princess gave the fairy a wolf to follow and protect her.

She left the hall, and wandered around the halls, and could hear the dragon getting the closer.  She found a collapsed tunnel and bones from men that had been eaten.  She correctly guessed that the tunnel was from the dragon, and the bones were from the men the dragon had eaten.

Then she turned a corner and came face to face with the dragon.

Dragon: ""I'm going to eat you!""

Her: ""Don't eat me!""

Dragon: ""But I'm so hungry!""

Her: ""Eat my wolf instead!""

Dragon: ""Okay."" 

&lt;eats wolf&gt;

Dragon: ""I'm still so hungry!""

Her: (Genuinely kinda scared, and doesn't say anything)

Dragon: ""I don't want to, but I'm just so hungry!  I'm stuck underground and can't get out"".

Her: ""Oh, we saw your tunnel.  Let me help you get out.""

Dragon: ""Thank you.  I hate eating people.  Really, all I want to eat is chocolate cake!""

Her: ""Come with me.""

&lt;wonder around a bit, find stairs leading up, dragon flies out and away&gt;

She returns to the princess, who was surprised that the fairy didn't kill the dragon, but happy that the dragon was gone.  They had a big party, until the fairy fell asleep from tiredness.


The fairy wakes up the next morning, in an underground room, but everywhere is quiet.  She wanders around, and goes back to the princess hall.  There in the hall is the dragon, all alone. 

Dragon:  ""I flew around and around, but couldn't find any chocolate cake!""

Her: ""Oh, let me make you one"".

&lt;She then goes to the princess's kitchen and proceeds to make a chocolate cake.  Each time the dragon asks to lick the bowl, and then eats the whole bowl etc&gt;

She then meets up with the princess and her guards who were huddled scared in a room.  She brokers a peace between the princess and the dragon, with the princess promising to make 4 chocolate cakes every day for the dragon.

They had another big party (with chocolate cake), until the dragon fell asleep.  With the dragon sleeping, one of the guards suggested killing the dragon, but the fairy quickly put a stop to that sort of talk.

Then she left, happy, ready to fight another day.

My Custom Gaming Table [pics](http://imgur.com/a/tVI3l)


*Inspired by [this table](http://redd.it/18olti), without your practical implementation I would have never thought to craft this one.*


I plan to add a bit more to it, but it does a great job as is. The top is made of three layers, one hardboard mounted to the frame, another hardboard sitting on that one to provide a flat surface for the gaming mat, and a sheet of acrylic to go on top of that.


The acrylic holds wet-erase markers just great. It can hold reds unlike the chessex mega-mat under it. As there are two layers for the actual map bit, it also works great to hold print &amp; stitch maps down.


The underside has an LED strip under it, and the color change makes for a great mood setting. Using a hue of green for being in the forest, a yellow for dungeon crawls, red for enraged bosses or volcano-type areas, blue for the watery zones, etc. Normally its on various intensities of white.


With the legs being 6 inches, and 2 1x3's they're mounted to, its a good 8 inches clearance under there. It's just the right size for a can of beer.


It's portable enough to move between upstairs and downstairs for use in the gaming room or the dining room depending on the night.

Build time was a little over an hour.


While not actually a part of the table, the table was designed around the Chessex Mega Mat [amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015IUAAG/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), and the mat does a really good job of keeping the acrylic from moving.

I just wanted to offer you thanks for putting together this community and all of its pooled resources. I've not commented or actively participated in your community, but I've been lurking and it's been invaluable to me and my kids. 

Until last night, I'd never played a fantasy RPG, let alone DM'd one. I'm a youth minister by calling and had always wanted to try DnD. After watching all four of the PAX games with Aquisitions Inc. I mentioned to my high school kids that it sounded like it'd be a lot of fun to try. Most of them looked at me like I was insane, but a few of us decided to try it out anyway. I began studying like a madman, reading anything and everything I could get my hands on and watching as much DnD on Youtube as possible.


My wife and I hosted a game night at our place, with those willing to struggle through DnD at one table, and with those not interested playing various tabletop games at other tables.  At the DnD table, we sat down and got going, none of us really knowing quite what we should be doing. But a half-hour into the game, the kids were already begging (literally) to make DnD a weekly activity. At the official stopping time for our game, they begged to play another hour. At the end of that hour, they still hadn't completed the quest, so they're coming back in a few days to finish! I could not have imagined things going as well as they did. Frankly between my inexperience and the stigma of the game, I would have called it a success if it didn't fall apart in the first hour, but now it looks like we'll be playing regularly together for some time to come. We were the loudest, most enthusiastic table there! 

We couldn't have had this experience without the unknowing support of r/DnD. Your advice to one another, particularly the openness in helping upstart DMs, and your pooled knowledge helped this know-nothing upstart DM and a team of newbies discover a new, exciting world that we can share together. Thanks!!

tl;dr-- We had a great first night of DnD, and we owe it in large part to you all!!",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_15wju4,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/15wju4/a_word_of_thanks_to_the_rdnd_community/,
1355536985.0,190,self.DnD,14vigj,Stealing Immortality - Rise of the Second (Part 13),,266,76,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14vigj/stealing_immortality_rise_of_the_second_part_13/,"Alright, my stomach is full of shellfish and daiquiris, and that means it's time to write part 13 of Stealing Immortality! When we last left off, we had gone to the first level of the Nine Hells to slay the God of the Kobolds, Kurtulmak! Along the way, Gandalf came back to assist us in ending Kurtulmak and going on our rampage, and the fight so far had been incredibly tough, with all of us but Chainsaw, Gandalf, and Z dying at least twice! Z and Gandalf were ready to fight the kobold hordes that had been summoned by Kurtulmak while Chainsaw charged the God to fight him toe-to-toe!

Chainsaw ran right at the wounded God, unloading all of his most powerful attacks into him while he was trying to recuperate. Meanwhile, Z and Gandalf were unleashing their most powerful spells at the hordes of angry kobolds, calling down lightning, striking areas with waves of flame, and unleashing bursts of air so cold that the beasts were frozen solid before they could even comprehend the situation. They were handling the seemingly endless waves well, pushing them back and preventing them from advancing. We all assisted Chainsaw as well as we could, tossing in our own attacks when we had an opening and buffing and healing him while he struck the God with all of his might, unloading his most powerful abilities upon him. His wounds eventually crippled him to the point of senselessness, rendering his attempts at attacking futile as they were easily dodged or parried.

The waves of kobolds from the mineshaft began to overwhelm Z and Gandalf, so we turned to help them, as Chainsaw seemed to have the Kurtulmak situation under control. Hordes upon hordes of kobolds charged, slowly becoming more and more powerful in an effort to defeat us after seeing their God's pain. Even the powers of a grand magus and a God could not hold back their rampaging fury, and we all pitched in to help them.

Just when it seemed like we would be completely overwhelmed, Chainsaw landed a natural 20 on his to hit roll with an exceptionally powerful attack, slaying the God of the kobolds and sending his minions fleeing in fear.

Chris: ""You swing your axe, bolstered by your sheer will and blessed with Holy might, downwards at the God. It cleaves right into where the neck meets the shoulder, slashing open his jugular and nearly severing his head from his body. He falls to his knees while he attempts to stem the bleeding from his neck, but his efforts prove useless as the last of his breath leaves his lungs. A colorless energy begins to seep from Kurtulmak's neck wound, swirling around as it begins to join with its new master. You feel the energy flowing through you at an incredible rate. Your strength increases drastically as the last of the energy flows into you. There is no doubt about it; you have achieved Godhood.""

Chainsaw: ""Nice.""

Z: ""Welcome to the club, brother.""

Steve: ""Two down, four to go. Where do we go now?""

Z: ""Ohhh, where to we go now? Where do we go... Ooooooo, where do we go now?""

Jay: ""... Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye...""

Steve: ""WHERE DO WE GO NOW, AAA-AAAAH-A-A-AAAHHH, WHERE DO WE GO?!""

And so we sang that part of Sweet Child O' Mine again as some kind of victory song.

Heidi: ""Alright, seriously now. Where are we headed next?""

Chainsaw: ""Well, there's two Gods among us now. We'll have a much easier time. And Gandalf might as well be a God, too. We've caused enough havoc here; let's go to a different evil plane. I imagine the devils here will be searching for us soon, too. We just slew one of their Gods in his own mine.""

Jay: ""Very true. Who wants to pick next?""

We rolled off, and next up for Godliness was Steve.

Steve: ""Sweet. Uhhh... let's go to Hades.""

Z: ""I hope you don't mean the God, since, you know, he's regarded as being the most powerful one in the entirety of the Outer Planes.""

Steve: ""Yeah, no. Fuck that noise... who's Incabulos?""

Heidi: ""Basically all of the Four Horsemen combined into one guy.""

Steve: ""Alright, sweet. Let's go take him out.""

Z: ""No. Pick another one.""

Steve: ""But this one's my decision...""

Heidi: ""Yeah, sorry hun. That one isn't happening. Do something simpler, we'll kill that one later.""

Steve: ""Alright, fine... How about... Abbathor? He's the dwarf God of greed, luck, and trickery.""

Z: ""Good God, by the time we're done the Planes will have ran out of the smaller races if we keep this up.""

Steve: ""DEATH TO THE MIDGETS! To Glitterhell!""

Jay: ""Problem.""

Steve: ""What now?""

Jay: ""Nobody knows where it is. We're gonna be dicking around the Gray Wastes for a while.""

Steve: ""Perfectly fine. More experience.""

Jay: ""For those of us who still need it. Alright, let's roll out.""

And so we spent many, many days traveling the vast expanses of the first level of the Gray Wastes, Oinos, searching for some kind of cave filled with gold and gemstones. Eventually, we stumbled upon a mountain with a mouth fitting the description.

Steve: ""Rockin'. Let's get to work.""

We were opposed by plenty of golems made of gems and gold, massive cave spiders, and other nasty things you'd find in caves. We didn't bother with the precious stones or ore and kept walking deeper and deeper into the mines, until we reached a thick door made of solid gold and inlaid with gems the size of a baby's head.

Steve: ""Sweet. I run up and kick the door in.""

Chris: ""Make a strength check.""

Steve: ""Alright, I don't run up and kick the door in. Can our God friends kick it in?""

Z: ""Chainsaw, would you like to do the honors?""

Chainsaw: ""You take one, I'll take the other.""

Naturally, the doors crumpled and flew open due to their sheer power. Steve strode in confidently through the place where the doors once were. Right as he stepped into the room, Chris stopped him.

Chris: ""As you enter the room, a hammer inlaid with gold and jewels flies across the room, nailing you square in the stomach. Do a constitution check.""

He failed miserably.

Chris: ""Save against death.""

Steve: ""Whaaaat? He threw the hammer THAT hard?""

Z: ""Well, he is a God.""

The dice were on his side, and he landed a natural 20. He sustained a massive amount of damage, but he got back up and we healed him.

Steve: ""Alright, you guys go first.""

Chainsaw entered first this time, brandishing his battleaxe. On the other side of the room, a particularly grumpy looking dwarf sat on a throne of gold and jewels.

Abbathor: ""What the blazes do you want? Go away, I'm busy.""

Steve: ""Doing what, man? Playing with yourself while you hoard your gold all up in here?""

Z: ""That was possibly the lamest thing you could say, Steve.""

Steve: ""Shut up, man. I've got this.""

Z: ""What, you're gonna talk him into giving up his Godhood? Alright, be my guest. I'll chill back here and-""

Steve: ""No, don't do that. Still need help. He's tough.""

Abbathor: ""Damn right I am. Get the hell out before I crush you like a bug, cocky little bastard.""

Steve: ""No way, man. Them's fightin' words.""

Chainsaw: ""We should have picked someone and let him get the killing blow or something like that. He's gonna die. A lot.""

Jay: ""Yeah, probably. But, it was his pick, and I suppose we're here to support him, aren't we?""

Z: ""Bros *do* stick together. Even though it's kind of reluctantly at the moment.""

And so we rolled off initiative, and jumped right into battle. Luckily, Steve had taken to being a clever bastard like Z, and the fight became very interesting, very quickly...

... And that's the end of 13.

Super exciting news: After careful consideration, I've decided to compile SI into an actual story/novel thing on my own. I've had several people come forward and offer their services as artists, and I've sent them descriptions of characters, and soon we'll be able to appreciate their incredible art along with more story parts. Part one of SI as a story is in production, and I'll release more details as it comes together.

I figured I'd write part ten now, and even start titling the parts with names that have at least *something* to do with what's going on!

Word of warning: The mood of the campaign changes quite a bit. Sarcastic humor and the players bullshitting fades, although it's still there. The next few parts focus mainly around one character at a time doing their thing to steal immortality for themselves, usually in a Star Wars-like fashion; a one-on-one with the God while the rest of the party held back anyone getting in the way. So, let's dive in.

After Z had said his awesome-sounding thing, we sat around for about 15 minutes, pondering what to do, as calling down a God wasn't going to be simple. That, and kicking down their front door wasn't the best of ideas, or at least not yet.

Z: ""Alright, I'm done with this. Get me the Deck. I'm drawing some cards.""

Everybody gave him a quizzical look, but nobody said anything as the Deck was shuffled and handed to him.

Z: ""Four cards. Steve, hold my stuff.""

After Steve agreed, he started pulling cards. His first one was Throne. Again.

Z: ""Guess the castle's getting bigger. Right next to this one, connect the two. Throw parties in it. That's yours for the moment, too, Steve.""

He pulled his second card. Donjon. Well, fuck. Our resident lucky bastard was about to be imprisoned a mile underground or on a different plane.

Z: ""That's fine. I still have two cards left. If I can't draw, then the deck automatically draws for me after a while.""

And so it did. The Deck reappeared in front of him in his cell in the bowels of the earth, and out popped Fates. Lucky fuck.

Z: ""Alright, good. I want to use it to prevent the effects of The Void, if that's the next card I draw. If it isn't then I'll hold onto it.""

He pulled his last card. The Moon, but with only one wish.

Z: ""Good. Perfect. Fantastic. This is exactly what I needed. I'm sick of being a Bard. This sucks. Remember my awesome Thief, Varan? Yeah, I'm gonna use my wish to change classes and essentially become a carbon copy of Varan, gear and all.""

Chris: ""Let me get this straight; you put your character, who would be nearly impossible to replace this far in the campaign, as a whole on the line because you hated his class. You were banking on the Moon just so you could go back to being a Thief?""

Z: ""That's exactly it, yes. I can't stand this whole singing and doing nothing else but that and occasionally tossing spells thing. If I died, oh well. Playing a Bard is that agonizingly boring to me, yes. Singing Magic Dance and Back in Black has been fun, but I can't do it anymore.""

Steve: ""Seems reasonable to me. Varan was the one with the crazy Protoss Zealot arm blade things, right?""

Z: ""Yup, that's him.""

Steve: ""I support this decision. Varan was freakin' awesome. Wasn't he the one you broke into the masquerade with to rob the entire palace blind and kidnap a noblewoman?""

Z: ""Yep.""

Jay: ""Yeah, if it was to bring that guy back, then it's fine.""

Chris: ""Right. I imagine you dug up his sheets so I could see what you had?""

Z: ""Damn right I did. Three years worth of stuff was in the way, but goddammit I found it.""

Chris: ""Alright, looks fine to me. Your memories and experiences alter to cater to a more roguish lifestyle, and your skills and abilities change as such. A sense of familiarity washes over you as you pull on your new gear. You feel lighter, faster, and more cunning. All magical stuff you found on your Bard, like personal armor and weaponry, disappears despite it being in Steve's ownership.""

Z: ""Take it and fucking keep it. I should have been a thief from the start. I have no idea how I survived nearly 15 levels with that guy. Fates to get out of the cell.""

Chris: ""A flash of light appears in the throne room as a man you've never truly seen before appears in the center of the room. Although you've never seen him, you have a strong sense of familiarity with him.""

Jay: ""I'm sure we can discern his identity from the arrogant way he walks and that evil grin he has. Or we could wait until he opens his mouth. I'm sure he's still the same asshole.""

Heidi: ""Yeah, let's skip the whole re-introduction thing. Anyways, now what do we do?""

Chainsaw: ""What if we built a church and convinced the people to worship whatever God it was built to? With enough praise over a certain period of time, I'm sure we could eventually call them down or interact with them, somehow.""

Z: ""Let's not turn into Jehovahs, dude. That's not cool, man. I don't want to have oranges thrown at me.""

Chainsaw: ""What do oranges have to do with door-to-door religious people?""

Z: ""I'm surely not the only person that hurls fruit at the dude who's come to your house for the third time in the same week asking you if you've found Jesus in your life, right?""

Chainsaw: ""I think that can be considered assault. Maybe even with a weapon.""

Jay: ""Envisioning Z answering the door with a stalk of broccoli and making a horrible pun isn't very hard, is it?""

Steve: ""Oh, good God. 'Do you have time to talk about Jesus?' 'I don't know, do you have time for a full serving of vegetables, motherfucker?'""

Chainsaw: ""I can even hear it in that snarky tone he uses... good God we're bad people. I can see Chris doing it, too.""

Z: ""Alright, alright. Fruits as weapons or not, it wouldn't go anywhere. They'd probably tell the Jehovahs they deserved it and dismiss the charges. Don't even bother arguing, if you were a judge and heard that you'd lose it and tell them to go away.""

And so the assault with a deadly fruit discussion continued until we remembered about Ormet, the God of luck we thought about visiting or something. We recalled that he was a fan of gambling, enjoying life, and a big believer in luck. So we called up the carpenters and masons and had them work with some scholars so they could build the most pleasing temple they could. Essentially, we had commissioned a shrine built inside of a pub/casino.

Word of our deeds had spread very quickly by the fast-moving oceanic trade cartels and traders moving out of the city. Triste went from a thriving port city to an absolutely booming one. The city grew larger and larger with more people flooding in. We gained several titles; the Hero Barons, the Lich Slayers, the Heroes of Triste, or sometimes just the Heroes. Even though we tried to tell people Gandalf killed the Lich and not us, they kept it up. Everybody wanted to meet us at the massive parties we threw, since ruling is boring and starting bar fights and getting wasted with your subjects is fun. A team of artists came forward, asking if we'd pose for sculptures or portraits. The city began flourishing like it never had before, and we were having a blast.

Eventually the temple to Ormet was finished, and we relocated the endless party in the castle to the temple, where the only real worship that went on was in between drinks and while praying for a good hand in poker. Heidi and Chainsaw weren't ready to denounce their own Gods, but they came and had their fun while we did our religious thing. We weren't quite sure how we were supposed to know if it was working or not; we just assumed that we'd get some sort of divine sign eventually, but until then we'd gamble, drink, and party like animals.

One night, Jay had some sort of dream/vision thingy where he saw the six of us playing cards in the temple with a man we had never seen before; he was described as about the size of a halfling and being of a very merry sort, wearing loads of green and blue. We assumed this was Ormet and visited the temple every day, staying as long as we could. And then, one day, it happened. We were mingling about when a short man matching the description wandered in with a few guests of his own and sat down at an empty poker table. We figured this was our cue, walked over, and sat down.

Ormet: “Evenin', gents. Nice temple you've set up here. Really captures what I stand for. Fancy a game?”

Heidi: “Naturally. What kind of stakes are up?”

Ormet: “Nothin', at least not yet. We'll put some up after we get to know each other, eh?”

We played cards and threw dice for a few hours, having a great time with this guy. It was really a lot of fun. To make the experience a bit more realistic, we had made some drinks for ourselves. After a while, Z spoke up.

Z: “So, think you're ready to play to win?”

Ormet put on a huge smile.

Ormet: “Alright, m'boy. What to you want to wager?”

Z: “Well, we don't have much on us at the moment, but I want to play with these. Make things more interesting, y'know?”

He pulled the Deck out of one of his pockets and tossed it to Ormet.

Ormet: “What's this, then?”

Z: “That is a magical deck of cards with various effects. Now, being a God and all, you'd probably be immune to some of the bad things in there. However, there are many good cards in there as well, and if we draw them we could use them to bet. But how about this; you put your immortality on the line to level the playing field. All of your Godly powers. Play with me as a regular guy.”

Ormet: “Those are some steep prices, m'boy. Now, what if I win? What do I get?”

Z: “Well, you get to go back to being a God. You'd have bragging rights; you'd be able to say you survived the most dangerous game of cards as a mortal.”

Ormet: “... Alright, I'll take that. How will we play, then?”

They agreed that the goal would be like blackjack, but to get as many good cards as you can, and electing to hold when you wanted to take no more chances. The winner at the end of every round would get the benefits of all the good cards that had been drawn by both players. Rounds would continue until nobody wanted to draw anymore, or someone pulled the Void or Donjon. Ormet worked his magic to make a deck that would function like that, as to not change the qualities of the one we had.

Ormet: “So, who's in then?”

Z: “Me and you, one on one. Let's do it.”

The next few minutes were incredibly tense. Pained expressions running across both Z and Chris' face as they pulled bad cards and desperately hoped that they wouldn't pull the Void or Donjon. After several rounds of Z winning, Ormet started getting upset, as he was known as a bad loser.

Ormet: “This ain't fair. Yer winnin' far too much; you must be cheatin'!”

Z: “How can I be cheating? We've been going back and forth in shuffling. If anyone could be cheating, it would be you; you've shuffled more frequently than I have.”

Ormet: “Watch yer mouth, boy. Ya don't know who yer messin' with.”

Z: “Don't I? I had this temple built to honor you. We knew exactly what we were getting into. We've studied everything we could so we could win your favor more easily. And now you think I'm cheating? If there's someone who isn't being fair here, it's you. You're supposed to be the God, here.”

Ormet: “You shut yer mouth, boy! One more game! The loser loses their soul, even if they don't get the Void.”

Z: “You're on.”

All of the patrons of the church were watching this game. It was incredibly tense, but, being a lucky bastard, Z managed to win.


Z: “I win again. Looks like the God of Luck wasn't as lucky as he was made out to be. The title's changing hands. You put your Godhood on the line.”

Ormet: “Enough! I've heard enough from you!”

Ormet drew his daggers and jumped across the table towards Z as he and the rest of the group drew their weapons, and the the battle with our first God began!

... And that's where part ten stops. When we come back, we'll have our first clash with a God! As usual, comment, insult, tell your own stories. Have a good one.

With a massive stat boost and general infallibility, Z conjured up a portal to Mount Celestia, the home of Lawful Good beings.

Heidi: ""Wait a minute. We shouldn't be taking out the Gods here. These are the ones Chainsaw and I worship, right? Or at least the dwell here.""

Z: ""Well then denounce them and worship me instead. Bam, powers back, sacrilege and blasphemy can begin.""

Heidi: ""That's... actually quite brilliant. Although I'm reluctant to, that would make everything easier.""

Z: ""And regular divine intervention would be pretty sweet, right? Hell, you could all do it so I have a reason to shield you from killing blows and stuff. Can you say, ""overpowered?""

Chainsaw: ""Yeah, but we won't be tricking the Gods here, like you did. Even if you're super-powered, they're just as powerful as you are. Maybe not as insane, but tough nonetheless. You've done something awesome, but don't let it do to your head. And the rest of us are still mortals.""

Z: ""Don't worry about anything. I've got plans. So, who's on the bottom level?""

Chris: ""Tyr, Brihaspati, Shichifukujin, and Trishina. It's ruled by Barachiel, and he'll probably come down to bomb your asses once he sees a bunch of dudes taking out his bros.""

Steve: ""Tyr's a viking. Let's not screw with him. What's Trishina the goddess of?""

Chris: ""She's an aquatic elf that sometimes swims around as a dolphin. She's the goddess of love, play-""

Steve: ""SLAUGHTER THE GODDESS OF INNOCENCE.""

Z: ""I sense radical alignment changes. But yeah, she seems like the least prepared.""

Heidi: ""This is probably *the* most fucked up thing we've ever done, slaying the goddess of fun. Also sensing alignment changes. I mean, once we're Gods we can most likely readily change our alignment or fit in to whatever God we choose to take the place of, but for now this is kind of like kicking a puppy.""

Steve: ""Well let's get this over with as quickly as possible, then. Who gets her power?""

Jay: ""We could roll off on it, but I think it would be more fitting for Heidi to take it. We could try to take the powers of Gods that are most like us.""

Heidi: ""Although this is messed up, I'm not opposed to the idea. Let's do it.""

And so we spent a while walking around and searching while Z had fun with his new powers. Walking on water, pulling rabbits out from our ears, and turning Steve into a tree at one point. It didn't take long before we bumped into her.

Trishina: ""Hello, travelers. What brings you to Celestia?""

Jay: ""Not a whole lot. Just here to check out the view and whatnot.""

Trishina: ""I see. I sense you are in the company of a newly realized God?""

Z: ""Yes, I brought them here to, uhh... do things. I don't know. They're my friends. Speaking of Godhood, can you show me some things? I have no idea what I'm doing. Primarily about promoting mortals to Demigods and the like.""

And so Trishina taught Z all there was to know about Godhood, and we started to feel bad that we were originally out to kill this woman.

Steve: ""Good God we're dicks. She's so nice. I can't do this anymore. Let's go slay some evil deities. She's too... pure.""

Trishina: ""What ever are you talking about?""

Z: ""Well, you see, I kind of cheated Ormet out of his Godhood in a game of cards so that we could resurrect our friend, who had his soul torn apart. Then we decided that we should go on a rampage and slay other Gods so we could all have fun... and for some reason, you were supposed to be our first target. Can you point us to the evil guys instead?""

She was shocked by this news, but accepted our apologies and sent us over to the Nine Hells, where we planned on taking out the lesser Gods on the first layer. Target #1 was the God of the kobolds, Kurtulmak. We managed to get to the Hells quickly, and were immediately swarmed by devils. And by swarmed, I mean we had about 25 flock to us at the same time within the first few minutes.

Jay: ""Well, this isn't fun. Z, do something Godly to scare them off. Like blow them up with holy magic or something.""

Halfway through the battle, which was actually going fairly well for us, even though they were hard to hit and hit like trucks themselves, Chris stopped us for a moment.

Chris: ""As you fight off the devils, a huge bolt of holy energy flies through the air, smiting three of them damn near instantly. You turn around in the direction it came from to see Gandalf standing there, his hands smoking with power.""

Everyone rejoiced at the return of Gandalf; our badass Wizard friend couldn't let us tackle Baator alone. With his help, the remaining devils dropped like flies.

Gandalf: ""I sensed you were on a righteous quest to slay the evil deities, and decided that I'd assist you in any way that I could. It appears that the easiest way would be directly burning them with holy magic. You're not using the full extent of your powers, are you, Z?""

Z: ""Can't steal all the glory. It wouldn't be any fun if I rained down bolts of lightning on every dude we came across, now would it?""

Gandalf: ""Fun must be cast aside in the Nine Hells. Use your newfound abilities to their fullest. While your weapons are still effective, call down the bolts of lightning. Freeze them alive, or strangle them. You can't trust a devil to fight fair, and you shouldn't be engaging them fairly, either.""

Z: ""Alrighty then. The fun begins.""

And so we ran across the burning wasteland, rending devils in two and burning them to a crisp with holy fire the whole way. Eventually we found a winding cave in which the God of the kobolds resided. We went down the shafts, laughing as we kicked the more powerful, but still stupid and easily slain kobolds into walls and crushed them like bugs. Eventually we saw an oversized one with a steel body and a tail dripping with venom mining away.

Gandalf: ""That's him. Steel your minds; he exudes an aura of fear. Even if he doesn't look menacing, he is still a God.""

Z: ""I'm gonna bless everyone with some kind of will bonus, assuming I can.""

Chris: ""Nope, they don't worship you. You may have absurdly powerful buffs, but you can only give them to your followers and yourself. The price of power.""

Steve: ""Ahhh, boo. Alright, let's do it. Can we get the jump on him?""

Chris: ""Naturally. He's preoccupied with digging, so it's easy to get a bonus. Roll initiative.""

And so our first real battle with a God had begun. Though we managed to cause quite a bit of damage and he was on equal footing with Z, he was still pounding the rest of us. Steve was hit with horribly powerful venom and dropped like a fly because of it.

Z: ""I'm gonna pull back and resurrect him. It only took a few minutes to revive Gandalf, so Steve should be a snap, right?""

It was, though he was still pretty banged up. Since it was in the thick of combat, he was only at 1/4 of his full health. Better than nothing. He was quickly healed back up and back in the fight, which dragged on and on, but it only made sense. The mortal members of the group actually dropped a few times, save for Chainsaw and Gandalf. Z was getting fairly roughed up too, but always bounced back due to some constant regeneration spell he had used.

The battle was incredibly rough. Z managed to taunt him and was practically dancing with the bastard, both of them rarely hitting each other towards the end, just hopping around while the rest of us took the opportunity to heal up and get a few free shots in.

Eventually, the God of the kobolds couldn't take any more, and we felt the earth shaking beneath our feet. Screams and shouts of more than a hundred kobolds flooding into the mineshaft filled the air as they charged us. The true meaning of fear was staring us in the eye; 100 intelligent kobolds standing in the doorway, sharpening their knives and smirking. Z and Gandalf turned to the kobolds and readied themselves to take on the hordes while the rest of us took on the God. Chainsaw charged in to take him on, one-on-one, while the rest of us supported him or Z and Gandalf. The most deadly encounter yet had begun!

... And so part twelve ends with Chainsaw and Kurtulmak getting ready to duke it out mano-a-mano, with Z and Gandalf fighting back the hordes of his ruthless underlings.

As usual, comment, insult, despise the cliffhangers, and tell your own stories.

1355165367.0,176,self.DnD,14m7t8,"Stealing Immortality, Part 5",,286,110,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14m7t8/stealing_immortality_part_5/,"Alright, so today I'll be putting out more parts than expected due to me staying home due to a stomach bug that's made me puke everywhere since 5AM. That, and a lot of people have been wanting several to be posted at a time. Be sure to read Part 5 if you haven't yet!

So, we had just been forced to hop through a portal on the tower in Hades after the giant ghoul had summoned a snowstorm that crippled the strategy we had just come up with. It *did* take us to the Nine Hells, as we had expected, but it spat us out on Stygia, the Fifth layer and a frozen wasteland dominated by a huge ocean with horrible things lurking in it.

Steve: ""Welp, let's explore the cave for nasty things and set up camp. Does somebody have Endure Elements or something?""

Heidi: ""I think I do, yeah.""

And so we spent some time clearing out the deceptively small cave to be a suitable campsite while we planned out or next move. No monsters, just weird fiddler crab things. Eventually we had a campsite as cozy as it could be in a frozen wasteland. The Endure Elements spell was used, and everything was okay.

Chainsaw: ""Hold on. Did I have any problems with the cold when we first got here?""

Chris: ""Nope. You were just fine. However, when the fire is made, you find it to be hotter than you're used to as opposed to it being nice and warm.""

Chainsaw: ""Well, since I'm comfortable, can I strip down and inspect myself?""

Jay: ""Sir, there are ladies present.""

Chris: ""Yes, you can. You start removing your gear behind the rock and look at yourself. Make a spot check.""

Chainsaw: ""A 19. Give it to me straight, doc!""

Chris: ""As you look at yourself, you notice a rash that you didn't before. You scratch at it, thinking that it's probably from your armor. As you scratch, the skin moves along with the motions more than it normally does, as if it was that nasty film on top of old pudding.""

Chainsaw: ""Oh, shit. I yell for one of the guys to come over and take a look at this.""

Steve: ""Aww, dude, come on. Nobody wants to see your junk, man. Describe it to us.""

Chainsaw: ""No, you need to look at this.""

We rolled off on it, and the junk-witnessing victim was Z.

Z: ""Get a fig leaf or something, unless it's your junk that's infected. And if it is and you're not telling us, I'm gonna beat you senseless.""

Chainsaw showed him the rash, and scratched at it to show what was going on.

Z: ""That's disgusting, yet neat. I'm gonna call Heidi over. She knows more about diseases and stuff than the rest of us do, and I doubt this is something you can make a nature check on. Good God, man.""

Heidi: ""I'm not touching it. Can I do something to try and identify what's wrong?""

Chris: ""Sure can. You call upon your knowledge of nasty stuff that you learned in Cleric school and are able to identify that the flesh underneath the skin is beginning to rot. Without proper treatment, it will spread to the rest of his body. Upon closer inspection, you can also discern that the rotting is necromantic in nature, and that he will become a member of the undead if you don't do something.""

Z: ""Check him for more rashes. I imagine you can regrow limbs, so if this is the only rash, I'm going to use his axe and lop it off about four inches away from where it meets the hip.""

Jay: ""Hold up. Contact with the ghoul made this happen. We should do something so that nobody has to touch him.""

Chainsaw: ""Don't I get any say in this?""

A unanimous ""no"" swept across the table as Chainsaw sighed deeply. After looking over spells and abilities that would let us cleave his leg off without touching it, we animated a rope and made a tourniquet at the hip, knocked him out, and got lucky with a Summon Monster spell that brought forth an Earth Elemental that we had cleave off his leg and toss it into the ocean. Not long after we did, something came up and snatched it from the surface. We noped the fuck back into the cave faster than the Flash.

Heidi: ""Alright, I'll use Regenerate to have the limb grow back.""

Chris: ""You cast the spell on Chainsaw, and his leg slowly begins to regrow. Before it reaches the knee, it starts becoming twisted and corrupted from the limb it once was. The leg regrows, but it is covered in bony plates beneath the skin, and the shin looks like it is bent backwards at points. His foot becomes clawed, as well.""

Z: ""Oh, shit. That's cool. Is the rash still there? Is it anywhere?""

Chris: ""No, there are no signs of the rash.""

Heidi: ""Well, he probably won't be too happy when he wakes up.""

Z: ""Maybe he'll have a super leg. He could use it like a second weapon since it's all bony. Or maybe it'll give him the power to jump over buildings and stuff.""

Jay: ""Or hop over them on one foot. That'd be entertaining to watch.""

As we joked about the possibilities that what we ended up calling the pointy leg, Chainsaw eventually woke up, looked at his leg, and freaked out.

Steve: ""Chill out, man. It's all good. The rash is gone, and now you have a super leg! Go test it out!""

It worked just as well as his other leg, but now he was cursed to forever be a freak. That, and he couldn't get his pants on.

Chainsaw: ""So, what? I'll be the pants-less Paladin now? I can't not wear pants.""

Steve: ""We'll get you a plated loincloth with a pointy codpiece of something. Use it to impale your enemies. Or you could wear pants like Jecht did in Final Fantasy 10. One long pantleg and shorts on the other.""

As we continued to bullshit about his new super leg, we heard grumbling coming from the portal.

Z: ""Grease slick right in front of the portal, stretching out to the ocean. Not wasting any time.""

Chris: ""Dammit, I was kind of hoping you'd forget about that. You create a grease slick in front of the portal as the grumbling grows louder. After a few seconds, the portal gives off the familiar sound of something exiting it. The ghoul stomps through, and immediately slips on the grease. He's now prone. Roll initiative.""

Once again, the ghoul was slow as hell and got a penalty to initiative since it started prone anyway.

Steve: ""Alright, now what?""

Z: ""We push it, that's what. Chainsaw, use your super leg to kick it and make it slide into the water!""

Chainsaw: ""Uhh... alright. I'll run up behind it kick it with my demon leg so that it slides into the ocean.""

Chris: ""Roll a strength check, and agility so you don't slide on the grease yourself. You get a +3 bonus to both now.""

Z: ""Awww, you lucky son of a bitch. You don't even appreciate the demon leg and you get bonuses because of it. I want one now.""

Chris: ""You could run up and kick it to get the rash or something.""

Z: ""Well, Chainsaw got it on his leg out of luck. I might get it on my ass or something.""

Chainsaw made his rolls, got a natural 20 on his agility and an 18 on the strength.

Chris: ""You deftly maneuver around the grease and kick the ghoul in the... 'fucking skull, this thing's a bastard.' ... The fucking skull. The force of the kick causes its skull to crack as it slides along the grease slick and into the ocean. As it sinks, a huge ripple is created by what you assume was a huge ocean beast.""

Z: ""NOPE NOPE NOPE. BACK IN THE CAVE, OCEANS ARE EVIL. DISPEL THE MAGIC GREASE, IT'S BEDTIME NOW.""

We agreed that now would be a good time to rest. Watch shifted around often, and eventually we assumed that it was probably morning in the physical world and that it was time to head out.

Z started singing the part of Sweet Child O Mine where they ask, ""Where do we go now?"" right into Jay's ear to annoy him, and because Jay generally assumes a leader-like role.

Jay: ""We go back home, that's where we go. We're in the clear for the moment. Even if the Liches know where we are, we're still in the middle of nowhere.""

Z: ""What do we do with the magic swag? The phylacteries are in our bags somewhere.""

Steve: ""Could we use detect evil or something on them? They're bound to a Lich, so they'd be tainted with evil somehow.""

Z: ""Oh God, it's the evil candelabra! Flee! Wouldn't that take forever? We have sacks full of the stuff. It could even be one of the gold coins we picked up.""

Chainsaw: ""What if we went to a blacksmith and had him smelt it all down into ingots or something? It's being destroyed and then remade into a completely different form. I mean, when you break phylacteries to begin with, you could still potentially reform them. It's just that the Lich's essence is gone from the item.""

Jay: ""That's a good idea, but we'd have to get back to the normal world. I don't want to spend any more time in this place than we have to. Shall we go back?""

Z: ""Well, we can go through the portal, since it's still set to this place, but the portal we used to get to the planes to begin with fizzled after a few minutes. We could try and find a city with a portal to somewhere in the mortal world, though. Unless the portal was two-way and we could make another and hop through that. But then we might end up in the middle of nowhere. Or...""

Jay: ""No, goddammit, we're not using the Deck.""

Heidi: ""Well then you don't have to, someone else will. I don't want to trek across the Grey Waste. That ghoul was probably sent by someone, and that someone might be looking for us since we fed the ghoul to giant shark.""

Z: ""Wait a second. The Nine Hells are full of Gods. And the whole of the Outer Planes... is there a God in the Hells that is a gambler or something? Can someone do a religion check?""

Heidi rolled a check, and knew that Ormet was the god of luck, gambling, and stuff like that. But he resided in the Elemental Plane of Water. 

Z: ""OH NO. NOPE, NOPE, NOPE. The Elemental Plane of Water is a massive ocean. And we'd need to be able to breathe underwater. And you know what's in the ocean?! Sharks, giant squids, and scary things towards the bottom. Mother Nature threw all the stuff that was too scary for Australia to the bottom of the ocean in real life, and I'd like to think the same goes for D&amp;D. And it's in the Inner Planes, right?""

Steve: ""Yeah, I'm gonna agree on that one. Oceans are evil. And scary. Granted it's probably a lot nicer than the one outside the cave, but still. Oceans are bad news bears everywhere. Why do you want to gamble with the God of gambling, anyway?""

Z: ""Well, if he's the God of luck and gambling, then he can offer us stuff that the people in taverns can't. Like teleportation, crazy magic swag, and maybe even Godhood. And we have all of this crap to bet. If he's a God, he should be able to tell what is and isn't evil. He wouldn't take anything evil, right?""

Jay: ""What if he stacks the decks of cards, or the dice are fixed?""

Z: ""We have a Deck of Many Things. With stakes like that, I doubt the God of luck could resist.""

Jay: ""It only has 18 cards. And you only have 17 left.""

Steve: ""I'm sure we could talk him into resetting it or something like that. Or we could just pull from the Deck now and hope for Moon or something. And I'm seriously preferring that right now. I'll do it. Three cards. Heidi, take my stuff.""

And so Steve gave all of his stuff to Heidi, took the Deck, and started drawing cards...

And that's where we'll leave off for now. I've felt sick twice writing this, so I'm gonna go puke. I'll be back later for Part 6.

1354858761.0,175,self.DnD,14fi7o,"Stealing Immortality, Part One.",,305,130,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14fi7o/stealing_immortality_part_one/,"Alright, I figure I should apologize in advance for any spelling errors, fragments, parts that don't make sense, or mismatched words. You guys are smart; you should be able to piece it together. I just started a new medication, and I've got fairly a bit of double vision and I'm dizzy as hell, but I promised you guys stories and goddammit I'm going to deliver.

This particular story is about a Deck of Many Things. The party here was myself as a Druid, Z as a Bard, Steve as a Ranger, Jay as a Rogue, Chainsaw as a Paladin, and Heidi as a Cleric. If you've been wondering as to why some of them repeatedly roll the same class, Chainsaw loves Paladins. He runs a very medieval Paladin. If someone points to a forest and asks if it's evil, you bet your sweet ass and six chickens it's evil. Heidi has a thing for Clerics, and before someone cries stereotypical female healers, she just enjoys playing religious characters for some reason, despite her being a hardcore atheist in real life.

Anyway, we were hired to take down a wicked Necromancer who regularly sent zombies to terrorize the local township. Pretty standard zombies and whatnot. We downed them with incredible ease, since we had two Divine characters.

Eventually, we made it to the top of the tower, where we saw the Necromancer entering a portal to another plane. Before we could pursue him, one of the most difficult fights we've ever been in began. There were four statues in the corners of the room. Their eyes began to glow blue as the stone began to crack and fall off of them. As Chris described what was happening, everyone went pale. Jaws and faces alike dropped immediately. We were now standing toe-to-toe with four Liches, all level 20. We were currently at 17-19, and fancied ourselves rather powerful and always prepared, but we weren't expecting this. We probably should have.

After rolling a lucky 19 on initiative, Chainsaw said, 

""I need a drink. Where do you keep the good stuff?""

We spent a few minutes staring into glasses of scotch, brandy, and in Z and Heidi's case, some sort of fruity drink.

Jay: ""Well, fighting drunk isn't going to help our case. We need a plan. It's five on four. We have a number advantage, even if it's just by one and these Liches are able to fuck our shit up with a wave of their hand.""

Steve: ""Yeah, probably. Unless the alcohol can make us charming and we could seduce the Liches...""

Z: ""Clever idea, but we don't have an ample amount of alcohol on hand, and even if we did, we'd be dodging goddamn beams of ice and thunderbolts in between sips. And for some reason, I doubt Liches would be up for a good dicking.""

Heidi: ""Well, we have Chainsaw and I. We've got spells on us that can stun or turn undead, right?""

Chainsaw: ""Pfft. Maybe you do, but I didn't take any of those candy-assed spells. Fuck that noise. I'm gonna charge at the nearest Lich and aim for the head.""

And with that, Chainsaw got nailed with a Hold Person spell and wasn't going anywhere. He decided to be useful and order Chinese.

Heidi went ahead and used Turn Undead, causing two of them to flee. To this day I wonder what exactly caused all-powerful undead beings with mastery over all forms of magic to turn tail and cower in a corner, but somehow it worked.

Z was a horrible spell user as a Bard; he had a few healing spells and buffs, but he also had all of his fancy Bard songs. We have this pretty entertaining house rule where anyone using a sound-based attack or ability has to sing a song metagame to keep it in effect. Out of everything he could have picked, he decided to grab a banana from the kitchen and sing ""Back in Black"" by AC/DC into it and stomp around the house.

Back in Black is a pretty metal song, as I hope you guys know. Chris was also impressed with his voice, so he gave it a bonus. All our defenses were bolstered by 4; saving throws, AC, and everything else. He just had to keep singing.

Steve, Jay and I opened right up one one of the two remaining Liches and bombarded it with everything we had. The Lich did the same, and used a spell that fired several lasers of random colors at everyone, with different effects. Luckily, with the help of Back in Black, everyone avoided it.

A few turns passed with the Liches beating down on us hard, but with heals from Heidi and whatever potions we had supporting us, we were somehow surviving. Chainsaw had broken out of his Hold Person and dropped the first Lich with a final mighty strike, then turned to the next one.

And then Back in Black ended. And he couldn't repeat it. Z had to think of something else, quickly. And so Holy Diver by Dio began, kicking up everyone's attack stats by 3 and dealing damage to enemies due to the sheer excellence of Dio. Naturally, the Liches turned their attention to Z, who proceeded to run around the chamber, dodging lightning bolts, fireballs, resisting several slow and silence effects. This gave us time to drop another Lich, since they were distracted.

And then one of the Liches decided that he was sick of Z's shit and used a push spell to knock him through the portal.

Without any songs, we were now at a massive disadvantage. And we got pounded. Jay's legs were frozen, Chainsaw's axe turned into molten rock, most of my clothes had silence effects cast on them, so I was nearly naked while doing my thing. Heidi was mind controlled for a round and was forced to scorn her Goddess, losing most of her powers. Steve was the only one without some kind of wicked sick status, and with the rest of the group incapacitated, the Liches were bearing down on him.

And that's all for tonight. It's late, these pills have made me incredibly tired, and I'm nearing the character limit. Part Two will be here tomorrow night!",,False,,t5_2r9ei,1355340237.0,,,True,t3_14fi7o,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14fi7o/stealing_immortality_part_one/,

How would we fare against a God and his minions?!

Z: ""So he's jumping at me? Alright, I'll extend my arm blades and impale him while he's in midair.""

Chris: ""Ummm... he's a God. You don't just stick a God like a pig.""

Z: ""I got him to put his powers in a bottle. He lost his temper and jumped at me, and completely forgot about the bottle. He's just an angry midget now. An angry midget with two nine inch blades in his stomach.""

Chris opened his mouth to speak, but only managed to expel verbal diarrhea before putting his head down on the table. He held his head and stared into his beer with a pale, gaunt expression on his face. Z leaned down to get right under his face while wearing the biggest shit-eating grin one can possibly pull off without their cheeks tearing.

Z: ""So, father of mine, should we all roll initiative to fight the four guys he brought with him?""

Our jaws dropped, but we had a bit of smile mixed in as we looked at one another. Jay stood up and started clapping.

Jay: ""That was the most beautifully cruel thing you've ever done to your father. Well done. Well-fucking-done. In all my days of playing this game with your father, I have never seen or done anything that wonderfully terrible to him.""

The rest of the table got up and joined Jay in clapping.

Steve: ""If there were any rites of passage in this game, you have just passed right by all of them and exceeded all expectations. I think you might have broke Chris, but goddammit that was fantastic.""

Chainsaw: ""You have got to be the most chaotic, snarky, sneaky, conniving evil bastard I've ever played this game with. And I'm honored to have done so. The student has surpassed the master.""

It took a bit for Chris to be able to form coherent words and sentences, but eventually he spoke.

Chris: ""After seeing their God murdered, the thugs he came in with reveal themselves to be water elementals and rapidly evaporate into nothingness. The bottle containing Ormet's immortality rolls along the floor and into your boot. Son... you ruined what I had hoped would be an epic battle in one turn, and scared his minions so shitless they fled to another plane. Nobody has ever managed to outsmart me like that before. I've never been so proud of you in my life.""

And after the expression of pride and a brief, awkward father/son bonding moment, we moved on.

Z: ""Alright, what do I do with the stuff in the bottle? Do I... snort it? Drink it? Shoot it up like heroin? How do I take his power?""

Chris: ""The bottle shakes violently at your touch. As you lift it up, the colorless, glowing contents of the bottle begin to spin around, making the shaking even more violent, until it approaches the force of a maelstrom. Eventually it breaks free from your grasp, shatters on the floor, and shoots up towards your face. The power of a God runs through your veins, and you can feel every ounce of it. You have the power to smite your foes, reward your followers, and perform miracles coursing inside of you.""

Z: ""Do I have the power to erase the memory of the two hundred people in the temple that just witnessed all of this? That'd be really convenient.""

Chris: ""Completely forgot about them. Yes, with a wave of your hand, the people return to their festivities, completely forgetting the events that have transpired in the past few minutes. Ormet's body has melted, leaving a wet spot in the carpet.""

Z: ""Sweet. Jedi mind trick. I want to take the deck of cards Ormet made with me. Time to head back to the castle and revive Gandalf.""

And so we headed back to the castle with our hands (well, Z's hands) stained with the blood of a murdered God. I guess part of being a God is instinctively knowing how to do things, so he walked over to Gandalf's corpse, and with after a moment of concentration, we witnessed the reforming of a soul, which was sort of like putting a broken plate back together. The color returned to Gandalf's face, and he did one of those stereotypical gasp inhales thing one does after waking up in a cold sweat.

Gandalf: ""What... how have I returned?""

Z: ""Killed a God, stole his powers, brought you back. Hope I didn't drag you out of Heaven, assuming a broken soul can go to Heaven.""

We then proceeded to explain everything that had happened to Gandalf while he ate like a pig. After having a few minutes to think about what we had done, he gave us all a disappointed look.

Gandalf: ""You should not have done that. By slaying a God, you have to take his place, you know. Ormet was the God of gambling, luck, and trickery, but he also represented the ocean, animals in nature, and lived on the Elemental Plane of Water. That, and you may have declared war on the Plane of Water.""

Z: ""Shit. I didn't think about that. Hmmm. I'm digging the whole power thing, but not the responsibilities. Can I go appoint some people to be Demigods and have them do the paperwork while I have fun or something? If I can do it as a Baron, I can certainly do it as a God, right?""

Gandalf: ""I do not know much of how the hierarchy of Gods works, or how Demigods and the like are given such power.""

Z: ""I'll go ask another God, since I have the ability to move across planes. I'll go ask one of Ormet's enemies or something. They certainly won't mind helping out the dude who gutted him, right? Hey, let's go on an adventure! Visit the Outer Planes! See the sights and get you guys your own Gods to slay!""

Jay: ""Yeah, I can get behind that. Not much else to do. Since you're already in shit with the Plane of Water and we're your accomplices, we might as well kick down a few doors and become Gods ourselves if we can.""

Steve: ""Totally. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into. Take this to a whole new level.""

Heidi: ""As long as we're avoiding the Gods Chainsaw and I worship to get our powers from, then I'm in.""

Chainsaw: ""Same here. What do we do with Triste, though?""

Z: ""I'd leave it in the capable hands of Gandalf, but I doubt he'd be up for such a thing. We've got wives, right? Let them rule while we're gone. And if they do something wrong, we'll just come back, beat 'em a little, and then go back to doing God stuff.""

Jay: ""Yeah, that sounds good. Open up a portal, let's do it.""

Gandalf: ""There's still the problem with potential enmity with the Plane of Water. They have a God missing from their pantheon. Rather, they *have* a God, but he's off slaying other ones.""

Z: ""Hmph. Well then I suppose I'll just go over to the Plane and talk it over with everyone... or we'll go to the Outer Planes and have some fun screwing up the Gods there.""

Heidi: ""You know, we could always get close to them before killing them and stealing their immortality. We don't have to break down their front door and stab them in the throat.""

Jay: ""While that is a very safe alternative, it's also very boring. Trouble is much more fun. We want to have stories told of the group of mortal warriors who broke down the door to Bahamut's palace and stabbed him in his fucking face, not about how we quietly poisoned the mead in Ysgard after forming friendships with Odin.""

And so we hopped through a portal to the base of Mount Celestia, where we spent the days gazing at the perpetually starry night sky while we prepared for our rampage...

... And that's it for now. This one was probably a lot shorter than the other ones and probably wasn't nearly as satisfying to read, but, hey. I figured getting Z's part over with soon would be a good idea.

As always, comment, support, insult, tell your own stories, hate me for cliffhangers, and have a good one.

I’ll spare you the back story but the battle began with the PCs at the edge of an orc village. The nature of their quest allowed them to either try to bargain with the Chief, or butcher the village. The lawful good half-orc paladin insisted that they try to bargain and reach an understanding.

The paladin steps out into the village and calls to the chief that he wants to talk and he means no harm. The chief responds by roaring and charging the paladin, which of course rallies all the other orcs in the village an initiates combat. I made everyone roll initiative except the paladin, I told him that being familiar with orc culture, he would realise that orc diplomacy is far more physical than verbal and that if he can physically dominate the chief they will have a chance to broker a deal. I explain to the entire party that when the paladin makes a check with an orc adjacent to him (not counting the chief) he takes a penalty. Then I sent wave after wave of minions at them while simultaneously conducting the skill challenge. The end result was a rather cinematic showdown between the paladin and the chief in the middle of a pitched battle. The whole party really liked it, the rogue, wizard and bard enjoyed the struggle of fighting without their primary tank/healer and the paladin enjoyed getting creative with his skill check. For example, his first move was to drop his sword and shield for an intimidate check. Then he bull rushed the chief and rolled a heal check to try and strike at weak points.

Everyone really seemed to enjoy the cinematic feel of a one on one boss fight taking place right in the middle of a larger battle. 

If anyone is curious for the mechanics of the challenge, I had successful checks damage the orc, and unsuccessful checks deal damage the paladin. Success ended the battle, failure turned the orc into a standard opponent who would have to be killed. I also just sent endless waves of minions at the other PCs which only stopped when the skill check ended.

TL;DR Constructed a single player skill challenge out of a boss fight for one of my players, then had the other players fend off endless waves of minions until the skill challenge was either won or lost.

I am surprised no one posted the Head of Vecna Trick.  This was not my idea and this was done in a realm where a DM had two campaigns running simultaneously: one evil, one good.
The evil party sets up a dungeons with a mystical looking head that they put a bunch of magical auras on.  They set up traps, monsters, and the like to make it look legit.  They then proceed into the local towns spreading rumours of the Head of Vecna.
The good party delves through the dungeon and finds the Head.  The good party draws straws and the wizard wins.  The barbarian decapitates him and replaces his head with their prize.

They quickly got into the game and started rolling and understood most of the concepts from the start. They found themselves eventually in the city. The issue was that it had been invaded by goblins that the players had to reclaim for the city by defeating the Goblin King. The role-playing was top quality though, they had to get into the castle and after a side track into an inn and a night spent with some prostitutes one of the characters learnt from the inn-keeper that each day the Goblin king demands two of the local women to go and entertain him. I did not intend this but it was so excellent. One of the players turns to me and says. ""Can we dress as women and be sent to the King?"". How could I say no?! It was so innivative and excellent that I said yes. They covertlly made it into the castle and eventually killed the king and about 50 goblin minions using special runes.

I was also under the impression that it was incredibly statistical which has never been my forte. When my friend unearthed the 3.5 books and suggested we give it a go, I tentatively accepted and it has since become one of my fondest pastimes.

Me and my friends have taken turns DMing the same set of characters through small, one session dungeons, spending more time rule checking than actually doing stuff, and it's been a great deal of fun. However recently I decided to DM our first large scale, on-going campaign. It's a massive jump from our small claustrophobic missions to an entire world that they can explore achieve the long term goals in their backstories. That campaign is called Malkenhide and it starts tonight.

So I just wanted to say thank you to this subreddit and the people on it who have answered my questions either directly, though answering the questions of others or through the awesome guides you've supplied here. I would not have had the know how or the confidence in my DM abilities to launch a campaign of this scale if it weren't for the help I've got on here. I'm sure I'm going to make mistakes along the way, but it's gonna be really exciting regardless.

So thanks for your help everyone. Wish me luck

After making it out there and walking in, we noticed it was empty on the first floor.  Kind of odd for working hours, but whatever.  We made our way to the 2nd floor where we encountered some workers who were very quick to tell us ""You can't be in here, go downstairs!""

So, we headed down, followed by a couple guys to talk to them and investigate the rumors.  While talking, one of the two that followed us said ""Hang on, I'll go get our manager downstairs.""  Being a rather naive and trusting group of adventurers, we didn't think much of it.  Come to find out, we allowed the cultists to spread the alarm and ambush us, leading to 1 giant fight that was meant to be 3 fights + 1 ""boss"" fight.

After some valiant efforts, we fell, one by one, to the sheer number of cultists.  It came down to the horde VS our cornered and injured half-orc Ranger.  They brought him down to ~20 HP.

At this point, we knew it was a TPK.  But we were resolved to play it through to the end.  Not willing to give his enemies the satisfaction of the kill, he stared them down...

""Fuck you.""

He proceeded to Coup de Grace himself for max damage, with a crossbow bolt to the head, bringing him down to negative something HP.  Seconds passed that felt like minutes.

""...""

Then he said:

""... and I guess, because of [Orc Ferocity](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc), I'm still standing... so... I'm gonna roll to intimidate.""

Naturally, our DM gave him a massive bonus to intimidate, considering he had just Tyler Durden'd himself in the face with a crossbow.  He ended up with something like a 30 to intimidate, which of course worked.  As he stared down the cultists, he freely walked out of the lumber mill, closing the door behind him.  Then he fell into the river and bled out.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_1i635t,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1i635t/epic_ending_to_an_epic_tpk_pathfinder/,

1354913051.0,161,self.DnD,14go1t,"Stealing Immortality, Part Two",,275,114,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14go1t/stealing_immortality_part_two/,"Since Part One was so well-received, I figured I'd do Part Two earlier, even though I don't think DnD is at its peak. I did ask Z to do an AMA, but nobody likes him so he's been playing Age of Empires 2 for the past few hours. But he usually does that anyway.

Anyway, when we last left off, two Liches were down, and the remaining two were bearing down on Steve. Chainsaw's axe was unusable, Heidi had scorned her God (which I'm going to explain more since someone commented on mind control effects,) I was naked, Jay was frozen, and Z had been pushed through a portal and hadn't come back out.

We all started swearing, and wondered what was left to do.

Steve: ""Jay, what do you have on you?""

Jay: ""Not much. I'll go over my inventory.""

Steve: ""Alright, cool. Chainsaw, do you have any backup weapons?""

Chainsaw: ""I think I still have that longsword I used for a while. Better than nothing.""

Now I'll explain Heidi. Gods are usually omnipotent and generally aware of what their followers were doing, so she saw what was going on. For some reason, she decided that this was an excellent test of her strength, wit, and faith. And so she took away her powers that required a deity. I'm pretty sure Chris was trying to kill us instead of challenging us for once.

Heidi: ""I have next to nothing. Some basic heals. No buffs, and I could count my damaging spells on one hand.""

Jay: ""Hang on. I might have an idea. I have a few vials of gelatinous cube stuff. Gelatinous Cubes are essentially acidic Jell-O, right?""

Chris: ""Yeah, but if you pour that on your feet, you're gonna get burned with some powerful acid.""

Jay: ""Which is why I'm gonna wing it at the back of the more back of the more banged up Lich. It'd be freaking out if its skull melted, right?""

Z: ""Wait a second. We can't just kill a Lich like we've been doing... GODDAMMIT, WE FORGOT THE PHYLACTERIES! Fucking... goddammit.""

Jay: ""Shit, he's right. I hate it when you're right. Something goes wrong. And you're not around to do something.""

Z: ""Wait a second... what's my situation on the other side of the portal?""

At this point, Chris had a massive shit-eating grin on. He had forgotten all about the phylacteries. While trying to figure out where they would be, he told Z he had been spat out onto a floating, craggy platform and to do an agility check to grab onto the ledge and save himself from falling into The Abyss. He made it, and started looking around.

Z: ""Every kind of perception check I can make, right now. Looking for the Necromancer."" He managed to get a good Spot roll, and saw that the Necromancer was going down.

Chris: ""Almost forgot about him. He's on a platform below yours.""

Z: ""What's he doing?""

Chris: ""Taking a break, since he's old and crippled.""

Z: ""How far is the drop?""

Chris: ""You're not seriously going to...""

Z: ""THE DROP, MOTHERFUCKER, WHAT IS THE DISTANCE?""

Chris: ""200 feet. If you dropped down, you'd break something, best case scenario. Worst, you probably nearly break your back and will spend a few hours wondering why you did that and thinking about how much that hurt. You'd just barely survive.""

Z: ""So the dude is stationary?""

Chris: ""He doesn't know you're there.""

Z: ""Sing whatever song I have that increases agility to help the check quietly. I'm dropping down on his head while he's stationary.""

Chris: ""Dammit... alright, what's the song?""

Z: ""Uhhh... was this one INXS?""

Steve: ""No, that was the charisma one.""

Z: ""Then it's Don't Stop Me Now by Queen.""

Chris: ""Alright, start singing."" Zaak complied, and started making the rolls Chris wanted him to.

Before he even got to the chorus, he had successfully landed a natural 20 on the agility check to land on the Necromancer, a 34 with all his modifications to tumble out of it, and a modified 29 on wisdom so he'd be able to predict when and if the Necromancer would move.

Chris: ""AND AGAIN IT HAPPENS! ... Goddammit. *Long, drawn out sigh* Alright. You land on him and roll out of it to cushion the blow, but fracture your left wrist incredibly badly. You can't use it without taking damage and making a constitution check.""

Z: ""YA DAMN RIGHT!""

Chris: ""However, he managed to survive, but just barely. He's literally taking his last few breaths unless you do something to stabilize him.""

Z: ""Can I sing something to him that gives him a bonus to make a check to survive?""

Chris: ""... You're gonna serenade the dude that unleashed four Liches on you, caused you to break your wrist, and caused general havoc on the nearing town.""

Z: ""Yes. The song for that one is I Love You, Always Forever by Donna Lewis.""

Everyone was silent for what seemed like an eternity.

Steve: ""You could have picked anything for that song. Literally ANY song in the world. You could have used something bolstering that encourages you. But of all the songs in the world, you picked a sappy love song by a Welsh chick.""

Z: ""Yes, I did. Problem?""

Jay: ""It makes you sound like a dweeb, that's the problem. If I ever start bleeding out, please, let me die.""

Z: ""I'll remember that."" He then started to sing, which embarrassed everyone at the table. He was successful, and the Necromancer was barely conscious. He was bleeding heavily, broken ribs, dislocated shoulder, legs were shattered, hardly able to speak.

Z started questioning the Necromancer in between verses. Hearing him sing this incredibly sappy song while threatening to beat him to death was golden, so we forgave him for now.

Necro: ""I'll tell you whatever you want if you let me go. I can summon the dead to take me away if you help me with your song. I'll stay in the Astral Plane forever. I'll give you whatever you want as long as you let me live.""

Z: ""Alright, let's start. Where are the phylacteries?""

Necro: ""There's a hidden cabinet to the right of the portal. Speak the words, 'In Death we are freed,' and it shall open.""

Z: ""Okay. What else can you offer me?""

Necro: ""One wish. I can grant you one wish. No tricks, no drawbacks. One wish.""

Z: ""Alright. Give me a Deck of Many Things.""

Everyone at the table sighed. Of all the things in the D&amp;D universe, he wished for the most chaotic item, capable of destroying campaigns, with the power to toy with fate and destroy Gods.""

Necro: ""It shall be yours."" He used the last bit of his power to cast an Unlimited Wish spell, and the Deck appeared in Z's hands. Chris explained that being mostly undead he didn't need nourishment, and if Z kept up his part of the deal for about an hour, the Necromancer would be able to recover on his own.

Z: ""How do I get out of here?""

Necro: ""Step through the portal, naturally. It will return you to the top of my tower, assuming you're not part demon.""

Z: ""Nope, I'll get through just fine."" He stopped singing and kicked the Necromancer off the edge of the platform to fall until he landed in Lolth's domain. ""Chris, you seriously thought I'd keep that promise? Really?""

Chris: ""Nope. *Heavy sigh* I'll just assume you go back to the portal, then.""

Z: ""Naturally.""

Steve: ""Why didn't you come back and help us?!""

Z: ""It might have turned me into some kind of scary inside-out flesh beast. It still might. But I have these cards now. I'm gonna draw one.""

Chris: ""Alright, so you serenade a Necromancer, wish for a Deck, and you're going to immediately draw from it instead of going back to help them? What if you get The Void?""

Z: ""What if he lied and I'll turn into a horrible mutated mass of pancake batter when I go through? I think I've got a better chance with the deck. Get out some cards, let's do it.""

At this point, everyone thought it was up to us. Z was going to lose all of his stuff, some kind of demon was going to chase us down, or something else horrible would happen. Then he pulled from the deck.

He got Fates. If you don't know, Fates allows the user to escape from any situation immediately by alternating reality. He started laughing like a maniac.

Z: ""I want to chug a potion to fix my wrist, then I'm going to use the Fates ability to go back to the top of the tower where everyone is.""

Chris: ""Goddammit... the healing potion doesn't completely restore your wrist. Instead it heals to a moderate sprain. You'll take damage if you use it.""

Z: ""Yeah, sure, whatever. That's fine. To the keep!""

And then, suddenly, he popped into existence in front of the portal, unseen by the Liches. He ran over to the wall, spoke the words, smashed the bottles, and waited.

We expected the Liches to melt into a pile of nasty magical crap. Instead, the two remaining Liches absorbed the bodies of the ""dead"" ones, becoming absurdly powerful.

Z: ""Well that's bullshit. Then again, I probably should have expected him to lie.""

Chainsaw: ""You think?!""

Z: ""I'm gonna grab some Tostitos and hope you guys have calmed down by the time I'm back.""

Needless to say, everyone was still upset, even though it wasn't entirely his fault. They did look like phylacteries.

Now we had two super powered Liches on our hands, restored to full health with all of their powers back, and little chance for escape.

Z: ""Deck of Many Things?""

Heidi: ""We don't have much of a choice.""

Steve: ""Yeah, I suppose.""

Jay: ""Who's gonna pull them?""

Chainsaw: ""I WILL PULL THE CARDS!""

Z ran over to Chainsaw. Chainsaw knew that there was a card that took away all of your worldly possessions, so he declared that he was giving all of his crap to Z so if he pulled Talons, he wouldn't lose anything.

Chainsaw announced his intent to pull two cards...

... And that's where we'll leave off for now. I've got some stuff to do. I'll probably be back tonight for part three. I think there will be at the very least four parts, maybe five. Not sure yet.

Anyway, keep an eye out for part three. Should be posted around 11PM. I also want to call Chris, Steve, and Chainsaw to make sure everything's accurate, because it got very confusing and chaotic at this point.

Anyway, share your stories, leave your comments, speculate what happens, get upset that I'm making you wait again, and maybe ask Z questions in his post! Or you can insult him!

1360359936.0,159,self.DnD,185mn3,A DM's Top Ten Tips for Excellent Dungeon Mastering,Kelther,182,23,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/185mn3/a_dms_top_ten_tips_for_excellent_dungeon_mastering/,"A casual conversation with my DM about the frequency of requests for DM advice in this subreddit resulted in this treasure trove of tips on DMing in general. As he is not on Reddit, he gave me permission to post to you all.

1.	Think about their characters a Lot. Like... way more than they probably do. Think about situations you can put in front of them, think about how they would react to certain things. Think about how party members would react. Even if they don't know what their character is like, you the DM should.

2.	Use props. If a character gets a letter, write up and print out a damn letter, get some parchment paper and make it look good. Find things that can be used as miniatures, which can get a reaction from players. Once I used a giant maggot Halloween decoration as a boss fight, the players and even a nearby cat were impressed by the danger and disgustingness.

3.	Encourage people to eat and drink while they play. It gets expensive to provide food so I would recommend against buying your players dinner every week. Encourage them to have their own food, nothing kills game focus like a rumbly tummy.

4.	Wait. At the end of the day You the DM are in charge and they came here to play Your game. If they are chitchatting, I've found there is no more powerful way to stop that than to simply put hand out over the table with the pointer finger pointed up and say Nothing until everyone looks at you and shuts their gob.

5.	Listen. Your players have a wealth of interests, which you can exploit if you know what they are. If your players are talking about ninja turtles instead of paying attention, maybe add a dojo of ninjas to the campaign somewhere. If they are making endless Monty Python references add more elements of humor. Find out what they Like and make your campaign that.

6.	The rules don't really matter. In Tabletop gaming there is an infinite expanse of minutiae to the rules, you can spend entire game sessions arguing about how even tiny details (especially tiny details) work. That is generally not fun (unless you've followed step 5 and find that they love that). So what do you do? Realize that every rule, Every rule, is only a means to make the game run smoothly. Don't hesitate to hand wave complexity away, the DM's call is the final call.

7.	Brush your teeth. That's specific but the rule should be taken more generally than that. If you smell bad or look gross it might put a barrier between you and your players. I recognize that some people are ugly and cannot help that but there are always ways to improve your image for the players. DMing is Leadership and Leadership takes Charisma.

8.	Prepare, don't over prepare. This is a tough balance to find and even when you think you've found it a difficult balance to maintain. You should show up to the game with any predrawn maps done, any miniatures you think you Might need ready, and a pretty good idea of what the events of the session will be. That said you should Not write out every line of dialog from every NPC ahead of time, that's constraining and will leave your players feeling chafed. Instead know the NPC feel what they might say not know what they will say.

9.	Be in the right state of mind. This is kind of a holistic thing, and it has a lot of facets but it is really important, to run a good game you must be mentally and physically ready to run a good game. Don't show up drunk or stoned. If you've had a stressful day do some deep breathing before coming to the table. If you feel writers block take in some fine media. Just, whatever you need to do to get Yourself in the right place. You can't get them there if you aren't.

10.	Have fun! Why the fuck are you DMing? Why are they playing? The answer should be 'Because it's fun' and if it isn't or you have a different answer then you are doing something wrong. I make it a point to try to ask at least one player after every session 'Did you have fun?' because that's the question that matters. If they say no find out why not and what would be more fun. If they say yes find out what they liked. Ask yourself the same question. Did I enjoy having them fight those whatevers? Did they?

&lt;letter&gt;
Tonight, I witnessed the most damage ever dealt in my 10+ years of rpg playing. I also got to witness my first every natural 20 on a craft nitro-glycerin check. There was fire, explosions, noise, wind, mousey hijinks, several large winged creatures, and a lot of dead people (but no bodies) 

There was also a metric fuck-tonne of dice rolled, to the extent that we needed to use a computer program to roll it and a calculator for the damage. 20 gallons of nitro-glycerin was dropped via druid summoned air strike onto the Zhentarim army formerly based in what used to be the ruins of Dagger Falls. Within the ruins the same druid and his Feline compatriot had smuggled 10 barrels of gunpowder into key locations.

8 Nitro-glycerin bombs were dropped onto the Zhentarim below. Almost all hit key locations, including an impromptu temple of Bane, an impromptu wizards tower, a camp holding 3000 grunts, an officer's barracks, a stable, a troll and manticore pen, and a makeshift beholder nest. The bombs each inflicted 338d6 fire damage. The gunpowder casks each inflicted 3d6 fire and 3d6 shrapnel damage.

Bomb 1 = 1180 fire and 14 shrapnel damage. Hit the clerics.
Bomb 2 = 1145 fire and 12 shrapnel damage. Hit the officer's barracks.
Bomb 3 = 1192 fire and 13 shrapnel damage. Hit the army camp.
Bomb 4 = 1198 fire and 11 shrapnel damage. Hit the wizards tower.
Bomb 5 = 1170 fire and 11 shrapnel damage. Hit the river.
Bomb 6 = 1148 fire and 7 shrapnel damage. Hit the north wall next to the army camp.
Bomb 7 = 1289 fire and 19 shrapnel damage. Hit the Beholders
Bomb 8 = 1200 fire and 10 shrapnel damage. Hit the monster pen.

The secondary damage from the shrapnel created by the blasts from the initial explosions was 5000d6, for a total of 17571 damage.

The total damage done to the Zhentarim army, the town of Dagger Falls, and the surrounding 3/4s of a mile, was 27190 points of damage. (Which is enough to kill 81.5 Tarrasques)

The enemies killed in the blast, and their xp values are as follows;
3000 lvl 1 soldiers = 150000xp
2 Gauths = 467xp
1 Beholder = 2800xp
5 Manticore = 875xp
10 Trolls = 1750xp
100 Horses = 438xp
4 lvl 4 Clerics = 467xp
4 lvl 4 Wizards = 467xp
1 lvl 8 Cleric = 525xp
1 lvl 8 Wizard = 525xp
1 lvl 5 Ogre Blackguard = 525xp
20 Ogres = 1750xp
1 lvl 8 Rogue Assassain = 525xp
1 lvl 8 Ranger = 525 xp

Total xp earned by each player character = 161639xp

And that was how the Wednesday campaign arc drew to a close, with the players riding hippogryphs and giant owls off into the sunset, with a huge smoldering crater left in their wake. :3

[Names of players] it has been an absolute pleasure to game with you this year, thank you for giving me one of the best groups and games I've ever had the pleasure to DM =D. It is truly to my shame that I am unable to give you the time you deserve to continue gaming =(, though I'll be more than happy to continue things once my work schedule has calmed down =). You guys are awesome, and you should feel awesome ^_^.

P.S. Yes, you can have all that xp, even level up your your characters if you like ;)

1362121496.0,145,self.DnD,19g90l,Lost my first character today.,Redditastophe,163,18,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/19g90l/lost_my_first_character_today/,"I've been playing the same 4E campaign for about two years now. It's the longest campaign I've ever played in, and even though I don't really enjoy the themes of the game (it's more Cthulu/Game of Thrones, I'm more of a Name of the Wind/Pirates of the Carribean kind of guy) I've kept playing because the group of people we got together is really an amazing group. It's funny because the game began as an open game in a Borders of all places, yet we attracted the best group I could ever ask for.

I've been playing Asteron, a minotaur monk. He's the Jedi/Paladin of a group that includes an egotistical Eldarin, a power-mad/lady-mad/drunk Sorcerer, a straight up evil black robed Tiefling wizard, and a gay half-orc Bard. There are about twelve of us in all, and we're a motley crew. Sometimes the group makes decisions that aren't exactly...good, but Asteron looks the other way to stay with his friends. He's only ever walked away once, when Gareth, the Half-Orc Bard and his best friend, set a lava spirit to destroy an entire town. (The town was infected with Cthulian horrors, but the fact that we didn't even TRY to save the people rankled the poor minotaur.) It's been a serious struggle for me as a player, because I don't really play to get into all of the moral grey area that a lot of the other players really love - I'm an escapist, through and through, and my favorite stories are about friends working together to overcome evil.

For the last year, since the end of our Heroic session, the world we've been playing in has been plunged into eternal winter. This was caused by the Winter Queen, of the Fae, refusing to leave when her season was over. We've wanted to go after her for ten levels now, but since she's an epic level villain, the DM threw distractions like dragons kidnapping children to sacrifice to Tiamat at us. (Of course, this ended with us literally knee deep in the blood of children. Like I said, very Game of Thrones. :) )

Over the last few sessions, finally at epic level, we've begun to assault the Winter Queen's fortress. It's been a multi-level dungeon, complete with weird NPCs and odd traps. Last session, the DM broke out a mechanic where after each action we took, we would pull a Jenga stick from a Jenga tower. If the tower fell, something pre-planned would happen, like a massive explosion or reinforcements for the enemy.

Tonight, during the beginning of our final battle with the Winter Queen, he announced that the tower would work differently - if the tower fell, something horrible would happen *only to the character who pulled last*. The DM didn't have to pull, and since he strongly hinted the ""something horrible"" was death, it was clear one of us wasn't making it out.

At the beginning of the session, the Winter Queen cast a spell collapsing her own Ice Tower and separating us all from each other. On my first turn, Asteron attempted to go into a trance and use it to find his way out. When I rolled pitifully, the DM told a story about how, during his training, Asteron had become prideful about his ability to survive tests in the cold. Because of his fur, he had believed himself better than the other students, and his Master had been disappointed in him. Gareth's player had written a beautiful poem from the Summer King, trying to trick the Winter Queen into leaving of her own accord. Unfortunately, his player rolled badly on the bluff check, so the DM ignored the hand-written poem and had the Winter Queen attack instead. One bard alone was no match, and Gareth was left alone, shivering and immobilized. 

One round passed, we pulled from the tower, nothing fell. Sigh of relief.

On my next round, I added to the DM's story. Asteron had meditated on his master's disappointment, and had come to the next cold weather test completely shaven - putting himself on equal ground to the other students. Reflecting on that old lesson, he realized he should be focused on finding his friends, not helping himself. This and a decent roll got him to Gareth, who he was able to warm up slightly.

Our Goliath Warden, Akaun, finds himself at the mercy of the Queen. She dominated him, and sent him after Gareth and Asteron. 

With one chance, Asteron attacked with a stunning power, hoping to leave Akaun with no options but to save on every turn. I rolled poorly, and the next thing to do was pull from the tower.

The tower was teetering. Even if I made it, soon one of Asteron's friends was going to die, and one of my friends was going to lose their character. So I did the only thing a Lawful Good character could do.

I knocked over the tower.

And so Asteron died, run through by his friend, who only realized at the last moment what he was doing. The DM decided to end there, and we all sort of grimly walked into the night.

Never lost a character before. I'm sure he'll be back, as there's more to do and we've revived other fallen allies before, but it was a weird feeling. I don't think anyone agreed with my decision, but to me, it was the only choice. I was brought up on heroes who, when presented with an impossible choice, choose the third option, even if it means sacrificing themselves.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_19g90l,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/19g90l/lost_my_first_character_today/,
1355700963.0,147,self.DnD,14ypr7,Stealing Immortality - The Plan is Formed (Part 14),,229,82,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14ypr7/stealing_immortality_the_plan_is_formed_part_14/,"Alright, it's been a whole two days since the last part of SI! When we last left off, Chainsaw had earned his immortality and we were assaulting Abbathor in order for Steve to claim his Godhood. He had also nearly died from a hit to stomach from a hammer thrown with the force of 1,000 dying stars.

Steve: ""Aww right. Let's get it ON!""

Chainsaw: ""We may be here to support you, but this is still your fight man. Do you have a plan?""

Steve: ""'Course I have a plan. Been working it out for quite a while now. Been conniving with the resident evil mastermind.""

Our eyes widened. Back in the day, Steve had been the chaotic, evil bastard known for ruining campaigns and dropping BBEGs like nobody's business. And now he had teamed up with the kid who had one-upped Chris.

Heidi: ""So how quickly can we expect this fight to end, then?""

Z: ""Very, if everything comes together. Which it will. If it doesn't, there's contingencies.""

Chainsaw: ""Should we let you guys do your thing?""

Steve: ""No, we'll still need support. More damage and stuff helps, naturally.""

Jay: ""My Spidey sense is tingling.""

Heidi: ""What does it say?""

Jay: ""Chris is fucked.""

Chris: ""Thanks, Jay. I love the support you give me. I know I'm the DM and the one controlling the NPCs here, but come on. At least a little love.""

And so initiative was rolled, and Steve and Z had gotten lucky. 19 and 17, just barely ahead of Abbathor, with a 15. The rest of us rolled like shit.

Steve: ""Nice. Let's do this. Alright, I'm gonna attach a couple flasks of oil to my arrows and use that fancy thing that lets me fire multiple in one turn. And then I'm gonna nope the fuck to the other side of the room.""

All three he fired landed, soaking Abbathor in oil and generally making him frustrated. Steve sprinted away, cackling like a maniac. It was that ""oh shit he's gonna kill me!"" kind of laugh.

Z: ""Phase two: I'm gonna split the fucking earth beneath the largest treasure pile in the room.""

Chainsaw: ""So you covered him in oil... for nothing?""

Z: ""That's where you're wrong. Very, very wrong. He's the Dwarven God of greed. Once his gold starts falling into the bowels of the plane, he's gonna run right for it. And since he's covered in oil...""

Steve: ""... He'll slip right down there with it. And since the oil was the primary cause of his demise, if I'm correct, the powers will transfer to me. And even if they don't, Z can always toss Abbathor's powers my way.""

Everybody's eyes widened as we looked to each other, and then at Chris. Z and Steve were sitting there, high fiving each other and generally celebrating.

Heidi: ""Shouldn't he get a check to save versus falling into the fissure?""

Steve: ""Indeed he does, but Dwarves have naturally sucky agility, and the whole covered in oil part's gonna cause a penalty. And if he's distracted by the gold falling into the ground, his check should be even harder.""

Z: ""Think of it this way: Wario, who we all know is a greedy bastard, would be more concerned about his treasures than the possibility of death. This dude is essentially a super-powered Wario. His checks will probably be boosted by the whole God thing and all, but come now. The fissure is about ten feet wide. He'll be slipping and sliding like a horse on a skating rink covered in lube.""

It's hard not to laugh at the thought of the lube horse thing, and we all looked to Chris. Once again, he looked defeated. He rolled Abbathor's agility check, and strength to try and grab onto a ledge, and critically failed the first and got a 5 on the other. As usual, the dice were on the side of Z and Steve.

Chris: ""You sly motherfuckers... again, you drop a God before a turn can even end. Goddammit. I should ban Z as a resource. Alright... Abbathor flips his shit at the sight of his money falling into a massive crack in the ground. He runs to it with a Darth Vader ""NOOOOO!"" going on, and as he does, he slips and falls, falling into the fissure. He tries to grab the ledge, but his oil-covered hands and coins still on the surface cause him to lose his grip and fall. Once again, a shining, colorless light shoots up from the ground after a few second, rushing towards Steve. You feel the powers of the Gods rushing through your body. Another one of you has done the unthinkable.""

Steve: ""Awww yeeeeeah. Not really unthinkable. We thought of it.""

Z: ""You flatter me. You take the credit; this was mostly your idea, you know. I just provided the fissure.""

They bantered back and forth, telling the other they deserved the credit more than he did.

Jay: ""So how long are you going to caress each other's egos for? It's kind of uncomfortable, like teenagers making out in the park.""

Steve: ""Alright, alright.""

Heidi: ""Shall we roll off on the next taker?""

We did, and Jay won the roll.

Jay: ""How about we go to the Abyss? Everything there is going to be fisting its asshole. Chaotic Evil and all. No attention will be paid.""

Heidi: ""I like it.""

Z: ""Same. Let's go fuck up Lolth.""

Chainsaw: ""How about we fuck up someone that isn't the goddess of the spiders? Spiders are scary, dude.""

Steve: ""Yeah man, you can go on your own if you want. I'm staying away from that one. Let's go with a less scary one.""

And so we got our shit together, Z and Steve cackling like Hyenas the whole way. Three of us were Gods, and the fourth was about to obtain it himself. Will he conspire with Z and Steve? Only time will tell...

And that's where we'll leave off. As usual, comment, insult, support, tell your own stories, and call out bullshit if you want.

Hopefully I can do this one without puking. It's nice to not puke.

Anyway, we didn't do a whole lot in our last episode but declare that all oceans are evil, chop of Chainsaw's leg and regrow it into some sort of demon leg, and kick the ghoul into the ocean. We thought about gambling with the God of luck and gambling, but he resides in the Elemental Plane of Water, and that's one big ocean. No way were we getting Z and Steve on board for that one. In the end, Steve decided that this was bullshit and he was going to pull three cards from the deck, and hope for Moon.

Steve gave all of his stuff to Heidi in case he got Talons or Ruin, and began pulling cards.

His first one was Ruin, which causes you to lose all of your non-magical stuff. It was all Heidi's now, so he was safe. The second card was Rogue, which causes an NPC friend to hate him. Luckily, everyone hates Steve anyway. His third card was Jester, which allowed him to either gain XP or take two more cards. Since we were pretty high leveled and were more worried about getting out than gaining levels, he decided to draw more cards. He pulled Talons, which makes you lose all of your magic items, but that didn't quite matter since he didn't have any. It was down to the fifth card, and we were all hoping for something good. He got the very useful Star card, which increases an ability score, causing his Wisdom to go up a few points.

Steve: ""Could have been worse. Now what?""

Jay: ""We think of something else.""

Z: ""Or I give all my stuff to Steve and pull four cards.""

Jay gave an incredibly deep sigh as they did that, and Z started snickering. He always liked taking chances, but this was the difference between life and death.

He picked his first card and got Comet. Comet gives you a free level if you can win the next encounter alone, so he jotted that down and pulled again. Second card was Gem, which causes the character to become massively rich. Ingame, we had a naked man laughing wildly as gold and diamonds proceeded to rain down from the air above him. He gave it to Heidi so he'd be able to differentiate the difference between his tower loot and this loot. 

His third card was Throne, which causes the character to gain a small castle and become more charismatic. Now, we had a naked castle owner laughing like a complete maniac in front of us. He forked the deed over to chainsaw and followed up. This lucky bastard had become a rich Baron, and we could do nothing about it. His next card was Ruin, but he didn't have anything to lose, so once he was done, he took his stuff back with a wild grin.

Z: ""Well, I had fun with that one. Any other takers?""

Everyone turned to Heidi, who hadn't pulled anything yet. Now that she had seen the power of the Deck, though, she wanted to pull cards incredibly badly.

Heidi: ""I want seven.""

Woah. Everyone looked at each other with wide eyes, and then at her with a stupefied look.

Z: ""Uhh... how about you take, like, two? Seven is waaay to risky here. Even I wouldn't take seven. Ever. Not even if we were up against Asmodeus.""

Heidi: ""I'm sure. Take my stuff and give me the Deck.""

Steve: ""Hun, you're thoroughly insane, you know that?""

Heidi was paying absolutely no attention to this, though, as she was too eager to pull cards.

As if the universe was speaking to her, her first card was Idiot, which caused you to take a permanent hit to Intelligence.

Z: ""Even the Deck is trying to tell you things.""

Heidi: ""Shut up! I'm still smarter than you guys.""

She took her next card and got Fates, which gave her a thoughtful look, and then a devilish grin.

Heidi: ""I want to use the power of the Fates card to avoid the negative effects of The Void, if I pull it.""

Chris: ""Can she do that? I don't know if you can do that. Anybody know?""

Jay: ""Well, the flavor text says that she can escape anything, even an instantaneous occurrence. So yeah, I'd say that it's something you can do, as long as you state it in advance.""

Chris: ""Well... alright, I guess it's okay, then. Keep going.""

She pulled Jester, took the experience, and kept going. She was incredibly smart to declare what she'd use Fates for, because her fourth card was The Void. Reality warped, and she wasn't in a coma with her soul sucked out after the card disappeared.

She laughed in a more maniacal manner than Z does, but it was reasonable since she had defied the Deck, which defies reality on its own. And then everything changed when he Fifth card was Moon.

The Moon card grants up to four wishes, depending on how mow much of the Moon there is on the card, which is determined by a d4. She got lucky, and had a full moon on her card; a full four unlimited wishes.

Jay: ""Wow. That's incredible luck.""

Z: ""And you thought pulling from the Deck would be stupid.""

Chris: ""She still has two more to pull. And there's still stuff in there that's no fun.""

Heidi: ""Like what?""

Chainsaw: ""I think there's one in there that imprisons you somewhere a mile beneath the earth with none of your possessions. And I don't think your wishes would apply in there.""

Heidi: ""Alright, then my first wish is to not have to draw any more cards, and for the Deck to be reset for everyone.""

Chris: ""Wouldn't that count as two wishes?""

Jay: ""Well, it's referencing the same thing, and it's all in one sentence. If she had wished for the deck to reset and for a pony in the same sentence, those are two totally different things. But if they're both about the same thing, I think it's just one. I don't know.""

We eventually agreed that it would only count as one wish (I still wonder if it was, maybe someone could clear that up or there could be a debate as to the legitimacy of the decision,) and the Deck reset and she stopped pulling cards. She took her stuff back from Steve, and thought about how to word the wish.

Heidi: ""Alright, I wish for myself and everyone else here, along with their all of their possessions, to be teleported to wherever Z's castle is.""

Z: ""Where is that, anyway? Do I get to choose where it is? Or do I just know where it is, and it's somewhere completely random?""

Chris: ""Uhhh... I don't know. It doesn't say. Since we're already fudging half of the rules, might as well fudge this one, too. Where do you want the castle to be?""

Z: ""Could I have it float above the castle of the capital city with a magical elevator leading up to it?""

Chris: ""No, you may not have it float above the castle of the capital city with a magical elevator that leads up to it.""

Z: ""That was stupid, anyway. Would take too long to get up there. Hmmm... can I... Hmmm... Can I have the Necromancer's castle expand into a castle and own that, minus all of the spooky shit in it, like the goddamn Liches that are probably still there?""

Chris: ""Uhhh... no. You can have your castle magically be built anywhere in the world, but it can't defy the laws of physics or be built around or into an existing building. Now, where do you want it to be?""

Z: ""Dammit. Then I want it to be built in a thriving city, where rule would be relinquished to me, since I'm all royal now. Can I have *that,* or do I have to put it in the middle of nowhere?""

Chris: ""*Sigh.* Fine. A castle is built within the city of Z: 'Triste!' Chris: ... Triste, a fair, well-stocked port city with a diverse population. Triste is your typical port town, with a shady part, a large market and bazaar outside of the docks, and a well-to-do sector where the nobles and mayor live, who has now given rule over to the Baron... what's your character's name? Z: 'I have no idea.' Chris: ... Alright, Baron Z, whose castle has been built next to the homes of the wealthiest nobles. I shouldn't be doing this, but now that I am, I don't wanna hear any complaints from you.""

Z: ""Hehehehe... you got it.""

Jay: ""You *do* realize that you've just given power over a thriving city to Z. *Z.* Allow me to state that again; *you've made Z the Baron of a city.* Does this seem like a good idea to you?""

Chris: ""No. But I've screwed you guys over a few times now, so I'm gonna let it happen.""

Chainsaw: ""This is awesome. Like, REALLY awesome. Although you REALLY shouldn't have done that. Even if it does seem fair for nearly killing us all... what, three times?""

Chris: ""That sounds about right. Anyway, you magically appear in the throne room of Z's castle, along with all of the stuff you found along the way.""

Steve: ""There are still Liches after us.""

Z: ""Where's my court mage? I need a court mage. Find me a court mage.""

Chris: ""Your castle has only the bare bones as far as staff is concerned; a system of guards, a small group of servants, and an adviser.""

Z: ""Damn. Well, I want to move all of this stuff to wherever the vault is. Where's the vault?""

Chris: ""I don't know, you tell me.""

Z: ""Uhhh... I don't know, give me ideas.""

Steve: ""In your bedroom, where there is a secret stairway beneath the bed that can only be moved by a vocal phrase from you and two other people. And it has to be spoken to a busty woman in a painting on the East wall.""

Jay: ""Wow. That's really complicated. Do that.""

Z: ""That's where my vault is. The password is known by myself, the members of the group, and the captain of the guard. But it needs my voice along with two other people's, not just three random people. The password is... uhhh... Stanley Hihat Trindad, the Fourteenth.""

Chris: ""Uhhh... alright, you take your loot to your chambers, open the way to the vault, and store it there.""

Jay: ""Where did you get that password? And why did you want the town to be named 'Triste'?""

Z: ""I'll never tell! Muahahaha!... Anyway, let's chill out and then... uhh... audtion...? A court mage. A well-known and respected Wizard. I also want a group of other mages to serve under him.""

Chris: ""Very well. You inform your adviser, whose name is...? Z: 'Err... Belioune!' Chris: Belioune, of your intent to find a court wizard and several mages to work with him. Anything else?""

Z: ""More guards, servants, and bring me the mayor in the morning. And the nobles, too.""

Jay: ""Well, this is either a terrible sequence of events that are going to happen, or wondrous ones. But it'll be partially insane either way.""

Steve: ""I don't know what you're complaining about.""

Chainsaw: ""Yeah man, we're nobility now. We're bros with the Baron.""

Heidi: ""Granted, we still have the Liches after us.""

Wolverine-style retractable weapons? A mead mug? A solid ball of metal for wrecking shit? It's a world of endless possibilities

So my party ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/2BhgonX.jpg) of our lego minis I posted the other day, for visual reference) was exploring an errand to retrieve some tools from a conjuror's laboratory. Our first encounter was with a cockatrice that our not-so-tactful gnome Bumscrudge, Lv. 5 mage (pictured in the link above) provoked into attacking. In an attack of opportunity against me, Saul Simon, Deep Dwarf Warblade 3/Swordsage, I fucking failed my fort save and was petrified to stone.

My party didn't really know what to do. Josie, the rogue pictured on the far left, decided to give my statue a strength check to test its weight to see if carrying me out was a possibility. (If I were sentient, I would not have allowed this.) She got a nat 20 and I toppled over, and my left hand snapped off as it hit the ground. 

Now I need to find a badass replacement. My DM hasn't ruled out some sort of canon hand, but that would be down the road aways. I could just do something like meld a Dwarven War Axe around it, but I have the feeling this has some really exciting and potentially badass or ridiculously goofy potential outcomes.

You’re a human, lvl 1. For your class, you hybrid shaman/ranger. Spirit companion? Bear. The first feat you take is hybrid beast mastery as a ranger. Beast companion? Bear. For your second feat, you multiclass into a fucking druid, who can change into any animal of choice. Wild shape? Mother. Fucking. Bear. At level 1 you are three goddamn majestic as fuck bears all at once. One player, three bears. Can’t nobody touch that shit.

For my next game I’m going to introduce Panda, the bear that was three bears. I met Brady the Beast Blackbear as a cub, when I fended off poachers from his fatally wounded mother, Sasha, using an improvised hornets' nest thrown weapon. In gratitude, Sasha became my shaman spirit companion, while Brady became my ranger beast companion. As a multiclass druid, I myself became another bear, thus completing our trinity. In beastform I can use Swarming Locusts once per encounter, so, basically, once every five minutes I get to slam dunk a hornets’ nest on everyone within a 7.5’ radius, granting my team combat advantage.

Brady, my beast companion, serves as my melee attack, since I favor wisdom over strength. We flank and use Predator Strike to wrack up quarry damage [1d12 + str + wis + 1d6 = 17 ave @ lvl 1]. Oddly enough that beats out my team’s barbarian/fighter, who averages around 14 with Howling Strike (unless he has rage support). With an extra 16 hp to throw around (+10/lvl), plus flanking capabilities, Brady can provide decent relief and support to any beleaguered defender.

Sasha the spirit polar bear provides my ranged capability, with Watcher’s Strike giving me an effective range of 21 sq (105 ft!) My axe-wielding barbarian/fighter ally appreciates the +1 accuracy boost, as does Brady, who takes a static -1 to attack rolls for being hybrid. Her Claws of the Eagle enables an ally to attack, then grants combat advantage, so the rogue in my party should enjoy Sasha’s aid. Meanwhile it allows Brady to attack without my presence, so I can just beat up on people at midrange with two bear fists while I chill safely with the bard, or while I sneak around with the rogue for CA support.

This build, focusing on wisdom and defaulting to con, then dex, allows for what I consider to be a complete character. You can literally be two or three places at once, and apply your actions according to the situation. Need more defender support? Brady’s got it covered, and Sasha can soak damage like no other. Control problems? Two words; hornets' nest. Need a little extra strike damage? Well hell, this build is one half striker, not to mention Claws of the Eagles’ striker enabling capacity. Leader falling short? Spirit’s Shield provides pretty solid at-will healing, while Healing Spirit and Spirit of the Healing Flood are both unbeatable options for spreading health around (and clearing minions).

The way I see it, this build is basically a one man team, so a team of 5 of these bad boys is basically just an unstoppable army of fur, death, and confusion. Whose spirit animal did I just kill? Was that one a player character, or a beast companion? Some may choose to hybrid shaman/druid and just be a two bear leader, while others may dabble with warden for true defender capacity. Still others might go the druid/ranger route and favor strength for some interesting striking capability. Either way, a full team of 10+ bears is versatile enough to handle any enemy threat.

1346084434.0,151,self.DnD,ywqv7,[Resource Guide] New DM Guide,HighTechnocrat,174,23,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ywqv7/resource_guide_new_dm_guide/,"There have been a ton of redundant ""I'm a new DM, please help"" posts recently. While the responses are always good, they're very repetitive. As such, I'd like to start a DM advice post. Here's what I've got so far, but *PLEASE* feel free to suggest more.

---
So you've decided to become the DM. Being the Dungeon Master can be a challenging, rewarding experience. You are equal parts friend, enemy, and story teller. You will be responsible for knowing and enforcing the rules, and making judgements where the rules are confusing, vague, or inconclusive.

Being a first-time DM can be very intimidating. There are many pitfalls for new DMs (and even many old DMs), so here is some general advice to get you started.

**Have Fun**: There is no real ""winner"" or ""loser"" in DnD. Tabletop roleplaying games are about getting together with your friends to tell a story. You, as the DM, set the stage, and provide the plot. The players should feel challenged, but they should never feel that you are actively trying to kill them without a good reason. That said, you should never ""pull punches"". If the player gets unlucky and dies, that's part of the game. The possibility of death and failure are what make the challenge real.

**Say Yes**: DnD is a game, and as such, it has rules. These rules govern what characters can do, how they can do it, and what happens. However, these rules couldn't possibly include every possible situation which characters might encounter. Unless you can think of a good reason why a character *can't* do something, let them do it. Set a suitable DC, and make them roll a check. Running straight up a wall might be ludicrously hard (DC 25 dexterity maybe?), but pushing a cabinet against a door might be fairly easy (DC 12 strength maybe?).

**You are the final say on the rules, but don't be a dick about it**: As the DM, your own the rules. If you don't like something, or the rules don't apply, you have the ability to change them. However, players may not like it if you run wild with the rules. The players need to know how the rules work in order to play the game. If you players don't like a ruling that you have made, avoid the temptation to say ""I'm the DM, and that's how it is"". Discuss the matter with your players, and find a good compromise. You may find that player feedback really helps you make decisions.

**Start at Level 1**: Many campaigns start above level one, and there is nothing wrong with this. However, as a new DM, it helps to have new heroes. Level 1 is far less complex than higher levels, and starting at level 1 will let you grow into the complexity as the characters level. If you and your players have a good grasp of how the game works, considering doubling xp until they reach level 2 or three. Level 1 can be fairly dull for experienced players, but this should give you enough time to get a handle on DMing.

---
**Players**

**How Many?**: There is such a thing as too many players. Historically, 
the DnD rules have been written primarily for parties of 4. 4th edition was written for parties of 5. In either case, you still have some wiggle room. I have run one-person parties and had a great time. Two, three, four, and five parties are a ton of fun. 6 person parties quickly become a huge mess: combat takes forever, people get bored, it becomes difficult to share the spotlight. 7 is nearly unmanageable, and 8 is a deathwish. If you have 7 or more players, ask one of the other players to DM a second group. Two parties of 3 will have far more fun than one party of 7.

**Keeping Them Focused**: This is one of the hardest questions to answer. I find that it is easiest to figure out what motivates players, and use that to lead them through the plot. New players are most often motivated by gold and xp. Getting new items and leveling up are both very satisfying. More experienced players can play more to their character's motivations (revenge, survival, etc), but new players will likely be more attracted to the mechanical rewards built into the game. The easiest way to use this is to grant bonus xp/gold whenever the players successfully complete a quest. This creates a very obvious Pavlovian response which will hopefully encourage good behavior.

For those not familiar with Pavlov: Player is offered quest. His mind is immediately filled with thoughts of xp and loot, and he begins to look forward to (and expect) the eventual reward. This is a ""Pavlovian"" response.

**Keep them in the dark**: Not literally; that would be silly. You don't have to answer every question you're asked, otherwise all of the mystery would be gone. If a monster does something that appears to violate the rules, but doesn't because of something unbeknownst to the PCs, it's perfectly fine to say ""you do not know why this is happening, but it is"". Make sure that they eventually have the chance to figure it out; this pursuit of knowledge can be very rewarding.

---
**Adventures**

**Pre-written**: Don't shy away from pre-written adventures. They are written by professionals who have been in the game for a long time, and many adventures are very good. They can be a good example for a new DM, and running a few will help you get a feel for the rules without needing spend a lot of time writing your own adventures. 

Even once you've become confident as a DM, pre-written adventures still have a lot to offer. There are plenty of free adventures available online, especially for 3.5 and Pathfinder, and 4th edition's pre-written campaigns starting with Keep on the Shadowfell are very popular.

**Writing Your Own**: Dungeons and Dragons is built on three ""pillars"" of gameplay: **Exploration, Interaction, and Combat**. Every game session will, ideally, include a bit of each. The mix will vary between groups and between adventures, but you need a little bit of each. At the end of every adventure, the players should be able to say ""We found X, talked to Y, and fought Z"". This could be as simple as  ""we talked to mayor, we searched the nearby caves, and we fought the goblins who kidnapped the mayor's daughter.""

When writing your own adventures/campaigns, be careful not to make them completely linear. Players like to have options, and will tend to ""go off the rails"" if the plot is too restrictive. You may need to improvise if you did not expect what the players decide to do, but this is normal. Embrace the opportunity to write a story with your players.",Resource Guide,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_ywqv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ywqv7/resource_guide_new_dm_guide/,moderator

Here's a combat excerpt from my campaign, The Long Game.",szthesquid,160,15,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/17df27/last_night_i_ran_one_of_the_most_exciting_intense/,"*CONTEXT EDIT: the players were hired to kill a young white dragon that had been raiding towns and villages in the nation of Albus. The dragon employed a force of about sixty kobolds who worshipped it as a god. The players pulled ahead of the kobold formation and warned the village of the impending attack, convincing everyone to evacuate safely. They then attacked two of the formation's scouting parties, and after the second battle, captured and interrogated one of the scouts. They learned that the kobold shamans carried flares which could be used to summon the dragon, and in a very Mission Impossible maneuver, dangled the temporarily invisible gnome wizard out of a tree, who snatched a flare off a shaman's belt. They then returned to the village and used the flare to draw out the dragon without needing to engage the fifty remaining kobolds.*

Last night my party confronted the young white dragon that had been raiding the countryside, which they had been contracted to kill. Before drawing it in, they rigged the town's grain silo and inn to explode, and set pit traps along the four roads by the village square. Luckily, the dragon landed on top of the grain silo to talk down at the party, thinking itself safe twenty feet off the ground.

The party's paladin dragonborn, Kalgar, was the only one who spoke draconic. Since the dragon refused to speak common, as it was the tongue of the ""lesser races"" and unfit for a dragon, Kalgar was on translation duty. So Kalgar talked with the young dragon, cleverly maneuvering it into revealing its plans and motives. The dragon was pissed at being outsmarted, though, and dove off the silo to attack Kalgar.

At the same moment, the party's gnome wizard Alvyn, who had been hiding in the second floor of the inn, launched a scorching burst at the grain silo, detonating it in a massive mushroom cloud. The dragon took nearly half its hit points in damage, but while it shielded Kalgar and Tong (the human monk) from the blast, they still took half damage, which dropped them instantly.

Now furious, the dragon leapt onto the the inn and tore off a ten-foot section of roof, roaring at Alvyn, who then jumped out the window while firing another scorching burst, setting off the barrels of alcohol inside the building, which funnelled the blast through the hole straight onto the dragon, which dealt another massive blow and bloodied it. Alvyn landed and turned invisible.

The dragon went into a berserker fury and charged through the inn walls after Alvyn, blasting splinters and planks everywhere and landing in the street, right on top of the invisible gnome, who was able to dodge the claws, but was stuck underneath a furious white dragon. 

Alvyn managed to get Kalgar a potion, who then used his Lay On Hands to revive Tong. The monk pushed the dragon back away from Alvyn and towards a spike pit, but the dragon reared up and blasted all three with its breath weapon, dropping Alvyn and critting Kalgar, leaving him a single hit point away from death. 

Knowing he needed to get the dragon away from his allies before he could help, Tong took off around a house, running into an alley where the dragon wouldn't fit. Luckily the dragon was so mad it wasn't thinking tactically - it could have leapt onto the roof and clawed Tong from above, but instead it tried to force its way into the alley. The dragon was so strong that it started smashing through the walls, brute-forcing its way through with its shoulders, and ruining the houses on either side. Tong just barely managed to slip out of the dragon's reach three times, getting lucky as the destruction sent a nail into the dragon's eye, temporarily blinding it. Meanwhile, Kalgar had failed two death saving throws - one more failed save, or one more point of damage, and he'd be dead.

Tong rushed out of the alley with a fractured arm and was able to use Alvyn's potion to get Kalgar back on his feet before the dragon blasted its way back into the square, now covered in wounds with sharp chunks of wood sticking out of it at all angles. Kalgar drew the berserk dragon's attention and ran across the square, pulling it away from his allies and toward a spike pit trap. Alvyn and Tong were both up, but severely injured. 

Kalgar crossed the hidden pit trap unharmed, but the dragon didn't see it. It half fell into the pit, with its front legs impaling themselves on the spikes, and smacking its jaw on the edge of the pit's other side. Kalgar ran into the alley behind the inn, and the dragon pushed itself out of the pit and followed, smashing its way through the two buildings.

At this point Alvyn realized that the dragon was taking out a main load-bearing wall of the only two-storey structure in town. He fired a blast at a creaking support pillar, and the inn gave way, dumping the second floor on top of the dragon and impaling its shoulder with a floor beam. Engaging it again, Kalgar threw his axe into the dragon's other shoulder, drawing it back toward the square.

I'm not sure I'm properly conveying how intense this battle was. At this point, Tong is at exactly 1HP, Alvyn is below half, and Kalgar is at something like 8. Alvyn's potions have all been used; Kalgar's Lay On Hands are gone; and everyone's used their second winds, so there is absolutely no healing to be had. Kalgar and Tong have each failed two death saving throws this combat, so another means death. The party is really and totally at their limit.

And the dragon is still up and charging back into the square. This time it manages to avoid the spike trap, leaping up and over Kalgar in an attempt to flatten both him and Tong. Tong dodges the blow, but Kalgar takes a hit, though he's still up and fighting. 

Using phantom bolt, Alvyn pushes the dragon back into the spike pit, impaling it yet again. Kalgar makes a last-ditch charge, leaping into the air at the white dragon that looks almost like a red from all the blood. The dragon goes for a bite to intercept, but Kalgar hooks his khopesh into the dragons mouth, spins around, and lands on the back of its neck, and drives a javelin straight into its skull as he roars in triumph.

At the end of the battle, half the town was wrecked. The grain silo had been exploded, the inn exploded and then collapsed, and a bunch of houses were torn apart as the dragon ripped through them. The party was completely out of resources, and one more hit on any of the characters would probably have resulted in death. Even as the DM, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

He created orcs, elves, and gnomes, but at the end of it he scrapped them all, saying ""Human is best race for any class.""
Then the Wizard cast Sympathy on the humans, being sure to back it up with a Permanency. The humans loved the Wizard, so the Wizard gave them a home.

The Wizard spent six days and six nights casting Create Greater Demiplane over and over. On the seventh day, he rested for eight hours to regain spells.

The Wizard periodically visited the humans and played with them. He cast Control Weather a few times, but a low level Cleric was able to get his 2nd level spell off in time, saving a bunch of animals. The Wizard thought this was odd, but funny.

‎After a few thousand years the Wizard decided to create a Son, so he cast Simulacrum. The Simulacrum levitated down to earth, glowing with a Light spell. Although the Simulacrum only possessed a fraction of the Wizard's power, the humans were so amazed by its cantrips and 1st level spells that they gave it a name.

However, some humans were able to Nat 20 their Will save and were able to see past the illusion. They saw that the Simulacrum, the claimed son of the Wizard, was nothing more then a mass of ice and snow! One of them, a 4th level Rogue named Judas, maxed out his Bluff skill and joined the Simulacrum on its adventures. The Simulacrum and its 12 fellow adventurers traveled the known world, leveling up, Judas always making his Bluff checks. Judas eventually decided to Prestige Class into Assassin.

‎Some time later, at a feast, Judas finally failed his Bluff check. With a few divination spells, the Wizard's Simulacrum revealed that someone among the party was, in fact, Lawful Evil. The Paladin of the party, Paul, swept the table with Detect Evil, but Judas was covered in Nondetection. Acting fast, Judas decided to betray the party to the BBEG of the campaign for about thirty silver pieces.

‎The minions of the BBEG came to the Simulacrum and nailed him to a large wooden pole. They also stripped of his clothing and equipment, robbing the Simulacrum of its Spell Component Pouch. The nails were in very loosely, only dealing 1d4 damage every few hours to the hanging mage. It took a while but eventually the Simulacrum was destroyed.

However, as the Wizard watched through his Crystal Ball, he saw that the humans made the fatal mistake of burying his body ""mostly intact."" It took him three days to find the Player's Handbook, but that met the conditions for the Contingency Animate Dead he cast earlier. And so the Simulacrum was raised, only this time as a Lich. However, doing this drained much of the Wizard's daily power, so, after seeing that the newly raised Lich still had people who hated it, the Wizard said ""fuck it"" and left.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,1357616189.0,,,True,t3_164ios,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/164ios/one_of_my_fellow_players_is_taking_a_class_called/,

I can still hear the dice clacking on his splints ( he has several fingers in splints because he occasionally had seizures and recently had seized so badly that he broke several fingers. He also used a walker to get around. He was in a bad way health-wise but he loved to torment us with mobs and traps and what not. I remember him chiding me after one particularly rough session - ""I always give you the means to survive easily - you just have to puzzle out the solution to the problem."" I would try silly combinations and try to solve his puzzles. I never build a character without a simple wooden club in the gear now. I lost a +2 sword to and my buddy lost +3 armor to a couple of his Rust Monsters.

Anyway, I regret that we'd lost touch over the recent years. I have relocated a few hours away and I only knew him as a DM. We had no contact outside of that. I am sad that he's gone. I am ashamed of myself for falling out of touch.  Mostly I just want to learn a lesson here and not take people for granted as much as I do. 

I know he wasn't the greatest DM ever and I am well aware that I am not even close the best role player around. But, we had some good times and I learned a lot with him.

Well, I have a new story which I would like to share.

Last week, nothing really notable happened to my group.  They got into the spice market, met some npc's, rubbed some elbows, and Saug became a level 5 commoner.  About half the people at the table like Saug, having warmed up and such.  He was no longer in chains and the bard and binder would let him eat off a plate when the psion wasn't around.  The bard also bought him a nice outfit and knitted a scarf.  I noticed the more numbers/loot oriented were not as interested in this session, so I decided to give them some goodies for the next game.

So this week, I had them fight some bandits.  So they get to the looting phase and 'oh, look, a sword', followed by 'an adamantine longsword named Ulfberht?', followed by trying to figure out who gets it.  They level 3, excluding the 'fighter' who is level 4, so this is a really upgrade.  The 'fighter' thinks it should be burned with the rest of the pyre he is building or returned to the dwarves.  The bard it all 'I am an elf, I can use it in the mean time'.  The binder is not sure what to do in terms of dividing it, as it is just the sword.  The psion has dollar signs for eyes and wants to sell it.  After the first hour, the monk just want's this to end.  So two hours later, the unthinkable happens.

The monk says that since we can't agree on what to do with the sword, we should give it to Saug to use/guard and we can decide this later.  Saug had already established that he could be trusted with small stuff and would not run away or cause too much chaos.  Saug is more then happy to do this.  The binder and bard like Saug and go for this idea, at least until they can find a vendor that will take it for a nice price.  Grudgingly, the fighter and psion agree.  They then go on, give it to him, and move on with the adventure.  Of course, Saug begins to play with it and the fighter teaches him how to use it without hurting himself.

""Careful where you point it,"" said the psion during the training conversation, ""you may cease to be a respectable member of society if it's the wrong person or place.""

I quickly reply ""Saug is now a respectable member of society?"" and got a laugh.

""you will at this rate,"" replied the fighter.  Then he then gave a salute, Saug returned the salute, and I decided to end it on that note.

So...that sword was a net +5 weapon.  In this world, that is so powerful and worth so much you can't actually sell it to anyone, as anyone with the money to buy it doesn't have a use for it.  I dropped it there to see what would happen, thinking someone would at least ask why it is unique.  So now Saug has a +3 adamantine longsword of sundering ~~impact~~ collision and will probably have it for quite some time, as they will be incapable of selling it to anyone for a price the would take.

Edit: it's actually sundering collision and it's a net +6.  Oh well.

Oh, and Saug has level in aristocrat.  He is now a respectable member of society, after all.  :)

D&amp;D makes no sense.  The mercenaries we call “heroes” accept cash to go into underground mazes and kill what they find inside like tunnel rats in ‘Nam.  The ecosystem is totally bonkers.  We’ve got floating eyeball monsters, we’ve got a huge assortment of animals that are just other animals glued together.  We’ve got zombies and skeletons who are exempt from the law of conservation of energy.  Summoners who ignore conservation of matter.  For some reason, when orcs and humans rub genitals  they can actually make kids.  I could keep going on like this but you know what I’m talking about.
	
The world of Vanilla DnD is totally bananas.

So I spent a lot of time at work not doing work and trying to find a solution to MAKE it make sense.  Some grand theory to explain all the insanity.  And I have.  I present my cockamamie idea.  So I'm gonna ask myself the questions I asked myself while I was supposed to be working and then share the answer I cooked up.  Ready?

*“Why are physics broken?“*

DnD is in another universe in which our natural laws do not apply.  It looks similar but the fundamental properties of energy and matter are unique to this reality.  So forget everything you know about science.  In the world of DnD, their word for physics is just called magic.  It has its own rules and properties and just as their world seems odd and unintuitive to us, if they could visit our world they’d feel the same way.

So when you fall 80 feet, the laws of gravity in DnD world, the equation isn’t 9.8m/s squared.  It’s 8d6 damage.  That’s just how their universe works.  So decanters of endless water actually can and do create matter from scratch and that’s not weird in DnD world.  There is no germ theory because there are no germs.  That’s all magic.  The periodic table is gone, their elements are fire and water etc.  Right and wrong aren’t about philosophical discussion, they are very real, measurable, identifiable forces that govern the universe.

*“Why is this world still in the dark ages?  The timelines span thousands of years.  That don’t make sense.”*

If their version of science is magic, then their version of technology, the application of science, is the application of magic.  It’s making +1 swords and everburning torches.  The things that we have invented to improve our lives, they invented in a different way with magic.  Think Harry Potter.  They have all the same conveniences at Hogwarts, but they use a magical solution instead of a technological one.

So in DnD, they have advanced their understanding of magic/science over time and they applied to to improve their lives.  At some point there was no such thing as a +2 sword, only a +1 sword.  Then some wizard figured out how to improve it, just like in our world we moved over time from harquebusiers to muskets to gattling guns.  But this world lost a lot of that progress, which I’ll explain now.

*“Okay.  Dungeons.  Why are there so many of these damn things and why are they always filled with monsters?”*

Those aren’t just dungeons.  Those are bomb shelters.  See, in DnD world there was a nuclear arms race of sorts.  It was like a DnD version of the cold war.  We’re talking about a lot of shelters.  People were expecting things to get real bad.  And they did.  When the magic-nukes started flying, the people who hid in those shelters were usually the only ones who survived.  People drank potions that knocked them out and they basically hibernated through the nuclear winter.  They came out after a couple thousand years.

Not everyone made it to their shelters in time.  Some shelters were abandoned or ransacked or the hibernating people were eaten by Worgs while they slept.  Some other critters moved in and called those shelters home. The surface world was insanely toxic and weird for a while and these shelters were a relief for a lot of critters.  Some got past the traps people left to protect themselves while they slept.  And they laid down a lot of traps.

 Yes, what I’m saying here is that DnD is a post-apocalyptic world.  Just take a moment to let that sink in.

*“Explain the insanely hostile environment.  I mean, you can’t walk 10 miles before a random encounter with some giant caterpillar or zombies or something.  This ecosystem.  Seriously.”*

DnD world used to be like our world.  Regular animals and plants and stuff.  When the magic nukes went off it had unpredictable results.  Many animals mutated.  Now you might say, “radiation doesn’t mutate like that”, but I’d remind you: this ain’t physics, it’s magic and that is exactly how magic works.  Magic nukes produce mutants.  Deal with it.  So anyway, some panthers became displacer beasts, some geckos turned into dragons, and the radiation allowed an owl and a bear to screw and produce kids.

The weird dangerous magical radiation has only recently subsided and new mutations are becoming more rare.  It’s only been a brief time since people have gone back to the surface.  The crazy ecosystem hasn’t worked itself out yet.  It’s totally unbalanced and bizarre because it isn’t natural.  Critters are still finding their niches, still learning what they can and can’t eat and what will eat them.  It’s Darwin overdrive out there and it is not at all safe.

*“Dwarves, elves, orcs, etc?”*

It wasn’t just the plants and animals that got mutated.  People got mutated too.  See, before the nuclear war, there were no dwarves or elves or orcs or even humans.  There was something kind of proto-humanoid like them, but they are their own thing.  All the humanoids experienced at least a little mutation and even humans are the product of that.  That’s why we can interbreed with elves and orcs.

Not everyone pounded those sleeping drinks.  The Dwarves and Drow and other underdark dwellers have stayed awake through the entire nuclear winter and Darwinian evolution coupled with extreme magical mutation created a race that could thrive in that environment.    Orcs never made it underground.  They got mutated particularly badly and they evolved to survive the extreme conditions of the surface so now they’re like the badguys from Roadwarrior.  In the vast time that people (now mutated into new races) were separated from the rest of they world, they developed unique cultures, languages, customs, and religions.  Elves left the shelters before humans and made their homes in the forests.  The humans were the last to wake up and it’s only been a few generations.  We’re not especially suited to any one specific environment.  We were the least mutated and least specialized.  

The geography of the world has been altered by the nukes.  People don’t recognize all these new animals.  They are small communities built close to the shelters they left and they are afraid to stray far.  These are the “points of light” and remains of civilization in a totally nuts world.

*“So why are we always going into these dungeons?  And how come the entire economy seems to revolve around this bizarre activity.”*

Well, like I said, a lot of the weird critters now roaming the world found their way into these places and made them their homes.  Remember I said this is a post-apocalyptic world?  A lot of that magic technology is lost to history but these dungeons often contain relics from a more enlightened, more advanced age.  Just like survivors would scrounge gas stations and armories after zombie Armageddon, the PCs are diving dungeons for the wonderful tech from the past.  These things are incredibly valuable and discovering them is in itself heroic.  It’s getting us all back on our feet, getting us back to that better world.  Finding the great science-technology and selling it is a huge help and this is a world that needs all the help it can get.

*“Character classes?  What up with that?  And why are these dungeon spelunkers almost always in groups of 4-6?”*

Clearing dungeons with armies is untenable.  For one thing, they are usually networks of narrow corridors that make large groups bunched and less effective.  Most importantly, the loot found is harder to split.  Since a dungeon dive might uncover a couple pieces of magic gear, it’s hard to split a holy avenger sword between 50 guys.  So these dives are handled by small, experienced groups of professionals.

You need someone with mechanical proficiency to remove traps and unlock doors, a soldiering type to walk point and give some muscle to the group, a chaplain to heal and give spiritual counseling, and a magic-user who can handle all the weirdness that comes with that particular field.   Rangers, kung-fu masters, lute strumming cheerleaders, etc also come in handy.

*“I thought you said magic was like technology.  So what about Wizards and stuff?  Are they like scientists?”*

Yes.  Kind of.  You see, before the apocalypse, there was no such thing as a sorcerer.  Magic-science was all conducted in labs, making potions and testing out certain magical sounds.  They couldn’t just make magic stuff happen spontaneously, just like an astrophysicist in our world can’t just wave his hand to summon a quantum singularity.  The sorcerers and wizards of today are like the mutants from the X-Men.  They were mutated and given weird powers that didn’t used to exist.  And they’re still working out all the bugs and testing to see how much they can do.  Some races are more magical than others.

So that’s it.  This little theory made vanilla DnD actually work for me.

Early in the dungeon they encounter a mirror. A player shatters it and the shards flew through the air in a flurry of deadly glass cutting all the players deeply before being destroyed by Magic Missile.

Later they encounter some glass on the ground in a narrow hallway. Again the glass attacks but this time they are prepared for it.

Finally they make it to the near end of the dungeon. They have low HP little magic left. They climb a spiral staircase to see the second to last room. The entire floor is covered in glass. They cast Detect Magic, powerful magic emanates from every shard of glass.

""Oh shit"" a player whispers. They look at each other, then at the party barbarian. ""Fuck you guys"" he says before finally declaring boldly. ""I walk across the room to the stairs at the other side.""

I pause, roll some dice. ""You make it to the other side. Anyone else?""

""*I* walk across the room."" Says the rogue.

Pause ""You make it to the other side.""

There are only two players left. Now they aren't sure if they want to the last person. ""I walk across the room"" says the cleric and moves his piece across the board before nervously looking at me.

Pause. ""You also make it across."" Then I look smugly at the last player.

Resigned to his fate the Wizard says. ""I walk across the room""

""You also make it across.""

""WHAT?!"" The other three shout out. ""Oh, *thanks*"" replies the wizard sarcastically.

They had forgotten that the entire point of this dungeon was to ascend the tower and collect a piece of the great Scrying Mirror that was shattered here in the last great war. I wasn't going to pass up a chance to scare my players for no reason.

1355109834.0,135,self.DnD,14l0sk,"Stealing Immorality, Part 4",,240,105,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/14l0sk/stealing_immorality_part_4/,"I'm back from my journey elsewhere and here to continue the story of Stealing Immortality with the much-anticipated Part 4!

When we last left off, we had gone to the Outer Planes so we could find the Necromancer's *other* tower on the second level of Hades and destroy the phylacteries of two super Liches! After successfully making our way there and tearing the tower apart in an attempt to find the phylacteries, we instead found our bags filled to the brim with magic swag and coinage, but no phylacteries.

It was not until an unknown enemy began banging at the door to the top of the keep that our brains began functioning and we remembered that phylacteries can be damn near anything, and not always jars of Lich... stuff. With the revelation that a few of the things we had taken were phylacteries, we openly wept as we realized that there was no way to tell the difference, and even if there was, whatever was at the door wasn't going to give us the time to.

""The banging at the door ceases as it is broken down by a monster of the likes you have never seen. It is a large, rotting humanoid, standing at about 12 feet tall. Frosted steel armor clacks against exposed bones where the flesh has completely rotted away. What skin is left looks as if it has been picked at by birds, and maggots fall from open wounds as it sweeps its gaze across the room, which has filled with the scent of death.""

A collective sigh swept across the table as we reached for dice and organized our sheets. Initiatives were rolled, and thankfully the massive ghoul moved at a snail's pace.

Heidi: ""Can I do some kind of knowledge check here?""

Chris: ""Sure. What are you trying to discern?""

Heidi: ""The basics, along with if it's sentient or not.""

Chris: ""What do you mean by sentient?""

Steve: ""I think she means if it's able to think, like a Lich does. Liches aren't mindless undead like zombies. They're capable of higher thought and have goals that aren't brains.""

Heidi: ""Yeah, like that. ... What can you tell me with a grand total of 16 points?""

Chris: ""Not much, but that was a clever idea, so I'll throw you a bone. It's just as, if not more, intelligent than a Lich. It has some magical power, standard undead weaknesses, but is resistant to fire.""

Chainsaw: ""And what can you give *me* with a... four?""

Chris: ""Nothing, but it notices you looking at it funny and turns to face you while unsheathing a claymore about ten feet long.""

Z: ""So, when broken down, a superpowered, angry Michael Jackson burst through the door after filming the tedious group bits of Thriller, complete with the funk of forty thousand years?""

Chris: ""... That's about the gist of it, yeah.""

Jay: ""What was the point of summarizing it like that?""

Z: ""I wanted a more entertaining mental image.""

We decided that since we couldn't get much, our best bet would to be trying different stuff all around to see what we could damage it with. Z sang Scream by the Misfits while we threw spells at it that failed to do much, and watched as it effortlessly slapped arrows out of the air.

Then it came time for Chainsaw, our main melee man, to take a swing at it. He somehow managed to get past its massive AC and cause some damage.

Chris: ""After attacking the ghoul, you notice that the chill that it brought is no longer bothering you.""

Everybody looked at Chainsaw, and immediately stated their intent to stay away from him, and even farther away from the ghoul. The ghoul retaliated with a swing which Chainsaw narrowly avoided, causing the claymore to become stuck in the wall due to the ghoul's massive power.

Jay: ""So, Michael Jackson can also potentially break through stone walls. Great. Fantastic. This encounter just gets better and better.""

Z: ""Why don't we try to look for weak spots while it's busy pulling its sword from the wall, negative Nancy?""

Chris: ""You can do that, yeah. Make some rolls.""

Everyone rolled, and only two of us learned anything worthwhile; Steve and Chainsaw. Though exceptionally powerful, the ghoul's frozen bones were brittle, and could be broken with a strong enough hit. However, these spots were heavily armored and had few chinks in them. The frost on the ghoul's armor also appeared to have a magical property to it, and another check confirmed that failed melee attacks against armored points would have harsh consequences.

Chainsaw: ""I actually hit the ghoul, though. Why do I feel weird?""

Steve: ""Doesn't matter, made checks.""

The information was relayed to the rest of the group, and after the ghoul dislodged its blade, it locked on to Steve.

Steve: ""Wait, why would it do that? I'm on the other side of the room. Chainsaw and Jay are in the way.""

Z: ""Well, he said it's intelligent, so it's going to think tactically. If the group knows to aim for the bones, it's gonna go after the guys who can hit the bones most easily. I don't know about you, but I'd go right after the dude playing Legolas in the corner.""

For once, Z had made some sense that normal people could understand. And so the aiming for the bones began. And good God did we suck at it. Arrows stuck it in its meaty zones, spells singed and zapped the armor, summoned beasts were knocked away, and hamstringing the thing wasn't going well, either. The ghoul simply zoned in on Steve and everything in the way was kicked, punched, or sliced out of the way.

Steve: ""Alright, this sucks. How much damage have we done so far?""

Heidi: ""I think just barely 200 or something. And it doesn't seem like it's going to slow down.""

Z: ""How much does this thing weigh, approximately?""

Chris: ""About 1500 pounds.""

Z: ""So, if we ran this thing into something at high speed, say, a wall, it'd most likely break right through it or make it brittle enough to kick down?""

Chris: ""... I really don't like whatever it is you have planned.""

Steve: ""Well, what is it?""

Z: ""It's busy going after you. So what if you ran in a straight line, towards one of the walls, and I made a grease slick behind you as you ran? It'd pick up forward momentum as it slid and become an undead battering ram. Granted, you'd have to outrun it since it'd be rapidly picking up speed, but you're fast. I have faith in you.""

Jay: ""That... is a really good idea. But what if it doesn't crash through the wall?""

Z: ""Well then it's still covered in grease. It might be resistant to fire, but it's not immune to it. It'd be slipping and sliding all over the place while burning. Fire would cause it to be distracted, and maybe we'd even burn the place down in the process.""

Heidi: ""Why don't we avoid torching the tower for now? It still has a portal we can use to go back.""

Jay: ""... Or to push the ghoul through.""

Chris wasn't very happy at this point. He had given us another super-tough thing to deal with, and just when he thought he might get one over on us, we took it all away. He couldn't fudge the portal as a whole not working since just one tower's slide puzzle was broken. While we worked to make it happen, he got a Grinch-like smile on his face that curled up and everything.

Chris: ""As you diligently work away at getting the proper things set up while Steve distracts it, the ghoul suddenly stops, its eye sockets glowing a bright blue, almost to the point of being completely white. It lets out a mighty roar, and the room's temperature drops well below freezing. Snow begins falling at a rapid rate, and you hear the beast let out a deep laugh as he begins to disappear into the snow. Chainsaw, you notice this happening but suffer no adverse effects.""

Z: ""I think I have a song that prevents weather effects, or makes us immune to them or something.""

Chris: ""This is a magical snowstorm. You can't dispel or endure the effects like you could a natural one. Z, as you sing, the cold air you're forced to inhale begins to chill and dry out your throat. You find it very difficult to continue singing, and eventually are forced to stop.""

Z: ""Can I save against it in some way?""

Chris: ""They'd have to do checks to hear your song over the wind.""

Jay: ""Where the hell did this come from? He's a battlemind, not a warmage.""

Chainsaw: ""He said it had control over some magic. I guess said magic is ice magic.""

Jay: ""But he kicked up a snowstorm and changed the room's temperature in one round. That's not just control of *some* magic. That's pure insanity.""

Heidi: ""Well, it could be partly ice, right? The whole ""chill of death"" thing and how it dropped the temperature while it was walking up the stairs.""

Z: ""Then the rest of its magical power is spent making itself fire-resistant. An undead ice elemental should be a boiling puddle of flesh when a fireball is tossed at it. Wouldn't this be difficult terrain for it, too? It's primarily undead, even if we're going to assume that it's part ice elemental.""

Chris: ""Fair point. It's slowed down, but it's still in its element, in a sense.""

Heidi: ""Unless it can detect life, we can go all guerrilla on it, right? If we avoid it long enough, it'll have to stop the storm to be able to see us.""

Z: ""Or, we can run. We tore this place apart for a while before the ghoul showed up. We should know it well enough to navigate, even with a snowstorm.""

Jay: ""But it would just follow us down the tower. Even if it's slow, we can't run forever.""

Z: ""What if... we went through the portal?""

Chainsaw: ""And end up in the Abyss? It could just follow us through that, too.""

Z: ""But the Abyss is in Hell. And there's nothing but fire and brimstone in Hell. Or we could always pull from the Deck, but that's probably a bad idea since we have the means to destroy the liches in our backpacks.""

Heidi: ""I'm gonna agree with him on this one. It's not in its element in the Abyss, and if we go in first, we'll have time to set up for it.""

We all eventually came to the agreement that jumping through the portal was our best bet. During our setup time while it was chasing Steve, the phials had been set to the Abyss, so we just had to make our ways to the portal, and we'd be able to set up there.

A few tense rounds passed where we avoided it like the plague. Eventually everyone had made it through the portal, and we had landed ourselves in the Abyss. After a few checks, we figured out where we were.

""You step through the portal and look around. You immediately question whether or not you're in the Nine Hells at all, due to the incredible cold that washes over you. After putting a few pieces together, you realize that you have wandered into the Fifth level of the Nine Hells, Stygia.""

We looked at Chris, saying different things that could be summarized as, ""you sick motherfucker.""

""Hey, I wrote how the tower portals worked a while ago. I didn't fudge this one. The first one took you to floating islands of rock between Avernus and Dis, and this one takes you to a secluded cave on the shore of Stygia's ocean.""

Jay: ""Well, this is fantastic. We go from fighting an ice ghoul in Greek Hell to an icy wasteland in Christian Hell. To top it off, the ghoul could pop out behind us at any time. We have no idea where we are, we're not equipped to survive this, and I don't have any ideas. And no, we're not gonna use the goddamned Deck.""

Z: ""Well, this is just *evil* ice. And it's not snowing. It's just cold as a witch's tit. Why don't we wait for the ghoul to come out, since it probably will eventually, and then push it into the evil ocean where it'll be raped like a schoolgirl by aquatic tentacle monsters?""

I think we all learned something about Z that day, as we all gave him variations of concerned and disgusted expressions. Thankfully, Chainsaw was there to break the silence in his typically awkward fashion:

""You know, the layer of Hell below us is made of a witch's tit, among things.""

And that is where we will leave off for tonight. 

It was bullshit, we called Chris out, but he timestamps his papers and notes any edits ritualistically after many other calls of bullshit. Part five will be coming tomorrow, and I might even write two if I'm feeling adventurous.

What?",jackofhearts12,182,45,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1dd7ql/i_stood_up_to_my_bully_dm_1_year_later_im_the_one/,"Fair warning, this will be a bit of a long story, please bear with me. Essentially a few years ago I joined a DnD group that was fairly large in size and a LOT of fun. We had two DMs who would alternate. Over time one of the DMs (DM1) started taking over and causing fights with the other DM (DM2) when DM2 was behind the screen. It got to the point where DM1 asked DM2 (who at this point became one of my best friends) to give full control over the campaign to DM1. Everyone seemed fairly ok with this, and life went on while DM2 began a couple side campaigns that were a lot of fun.

DM2 had this girlfriend, we'll just call her GF. She's super cool and we all like her and she roleplays well. Unfortunately, she had an inappropriate relationship with DM1 which eventually led to her leaving DM2 for DM1, making things significantly awkward in session. DM2 was being a GREAT sport about it and still went to sessions and played with a civil manner. This is when DM1 started to become My Bully DM.

It started off in small doses. He would ""forget"" to send a text to invite DM2 to come play. He would tell GF that DM2 said awful things about her. He would pretend to not hear him when he asked a question in session.

Then it got worse. Favoritism was rampant, as he would reward his brother (who also plays with us) constantly, tell GF to re-roll her low rolls, punish those who didn't follow his railroad by focussing unfair ammounts of fire-power against them, offer up really cool powerups to everyone but DM2, give most people sweet story-related missions...but not DM2.

Every time someone did something that irritated him he would tweet about it, and it usually focused on DM2. Now I'll admit that DM2 likes to talk and have fun with his options, but he's at least creative about it. DM1 sees this as DM2 trying to alter the game when really...

ex of denying DM2 his creativity: The party must cross a canyon. My monk flies across with a rope. Everyone else has fly spells or bonuses to their jump abilities. Makes sense. DM2 plays a goliath and asks the DM what happens if he doesn't make the jump. DM1 replies, you fall to your death. So, DM2 says he's going to swing down on the rope that my monk left and use athletics to climb up. DM1 denies there was a rope. I say I jumped with a rope, we can hold onto it while he climbs, its cool. DM1 throws a tantrum saying DM2 is trying to bend the game to his will and not following the rules.

ex of favoriting his brother: Each square is what? 5 ft? So if your character was, say 300 feet away, in a separate building altogether, but DM2 is doing something (completely in character) that your character you might disagree with....do you immediately place your mini next to DM2 and say ""hey, I saw the whole thing, stop that"". No. That's meta-gaming, but DM1 has ALWAYS been turning a blind eye to this behavior.


The next stage of DM1's rule is that he started a second campaign, because Epic Tier is, admittedly, difficult, and he wanted something easier to handle on the side (direct quote from his twitter feed here) ""with a smaller group."" So who is in this ""smaller group""? Well he invites every player from his original group, excluding a couple who rarely make the sessions anyway, and of course, DM2. At first I didn't get an invite and this actually made me happy because it really was just a smaller group and me and DM2 could do other campaigns if need be.

Then I get an invite. Not only that, but DM1 has added another player besides me. I calmly and politely went to DM1's house and told him in person that I was flattered he invited me but I didn't want to take part in his game that very much seemed like a way of getting rid of DM2. I'm all for changing groups and trying new things, and exclusion happens all the time when changing groups...but that's just not how it felt. SO, I said no, he said ok, that's fine, it'll keep the size down. 10 months later....he adds ANOTHER player. So, it's the exact same size, but he plays this group all the time.

Backtrack. Not much long after he started the second campaign he begins to tweet how terrible planning his first campaign is, and how his players disrespect him and how much better his new one is, etc etc. It even goes far enough to outright call me and DM2 children and says that we ruin sessions for him. We're never named, but his passive aggressiveness needs work because its VERY pointed. So, I had enough and I straight up said that I wouldn't be coming to his sessions anymore. He had a fit about it, saying he feels bad about what he said and he didn't want any ""blood shed over this"". I wound up sending him a lengthy e-mail pointing out all the reasons I've stated above of why I am not comfortable playing with him anymore and signed it with ""DnD is a game, and this doesn't feel like one anymore"". 

1 Year Later.
He has been DM'ing his second campaign only, and months ago I sent him an e-mail saying I was sorry for being so harsh. I didn't ask for anything then, I just wanted him to know I didn't think he was a terrible person. We have another friend who has us playing a Star Wars campaign together (like DM1, DM2, DM1's brother and GF). It's fun, but I can tell I really damaged things. DM1 doesn't look me in the eyes ever and when its my turn to do things he's noisily working on something else on his laptop and showing the SW GM this and that, taking focus from me and DM2. I don't say anything about it because I don't want to quit playing this campaign.

So anyways, long story short now...I feel bad. Like really bad, and my other buddy who plays with us has a new gf and she's now playing their second campaign, and to make matters worse today's the day they're getting back into the first campaign...INCLUDING my buddy's new gf too.

I was talking to DM1's GF and (being the optimistic nice lady she is) told me to just ask DM1 nicely if I can come back if I wanted to. He's understanding, she said, he'll appreciate your honesty, she said.

I shouldn't have been surprised that she was wrong about him. He's not letting me back due to discomfort. All my friends are playing in the campaign that got me into DnD, and I'm humiliated because I actually asked him if I could come back. They started an hour ago, and will be going for 9 hours.

Am I asking for advice? Or sympathy? I don't know. I guess I just need validation that I did the right thing and a reminder that it is just a game and this doesn't dictate who I am as a person, or who they are as people for that matter. Right?

EDIT: The trend I am seeing in your advice is that I should be moving on and trying other DnD stuff with DM2. You're all absolutely right. We've actually been toying with various campaigns with some other friends, and I even convinced my roommate to DM a campaign. They're very enjoyable, but I guess we just get nostalgic and sad about how things used to be. Some others have said that I should talk to my Star Wars GM. I really would, but he's good friends with DM1, and I'm pretty sure (if the rumor is true) that they've been playtesting Edge of the Empire...which might lead to a whole new second Star Wars campaign, and the process repeats it seems. SW GM is a great guy, but I guess I haven't known him for as long as the rest. Oh well. That'll be another thing to move on from soon enough if patterns continue.

I really appreciate the feedback, guys. You've all been super helpful and encouraging.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,1367281813.0,,,True,t3_1dd7ql,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1dd7ql/i_stood_up_to_my_bully_dm_1_year_later_im_the_one/,

All editions

The world does not stop just because you are chasing a shiny. The army bearing down on a town moves x a day even if you are not paying attention. The bad guys continue to plot an scheme and advance their plans even if you ignore them. And if you know they are going to burn down an orphanage in x days ad you go on a dragon hunt for x+9 days letting the orphanage burn that is an evil act. There are consequences to your actions and inactions. 

3.5 

Roll 2 20's on an attack roll and its max damage. Once you have those you get a fate roll. If it comes up 20 as well it's an instant kill no matter what. (EDIT: players can save vs massive damage per the rules in the DMG with the base damage of the mobs attack take off of the roll as a penalty same goes for major NPC's. Sorry I'm a retard and forgot to include this.)

If your character gets old/dies after having a child and you reach ""epic levels"" you get bonuses for playing your child. (Bloodline of heroes, generally bonuses based on what your famous parent was). Being the offspring of 2 players epic characters means you get to choose to be like one or the other. (EDIT: Normally something like a +1 to a stat or +2 to a relevant skill or a ""heirloom"")

4th Ed

Powers that push the mob/player deal a d4 of damage for every square of movement they cannot complete from hitting a wall or some other object, unless of course the damage would cause them to smash through said object. (Dex check to halve damage) Aka if you get pushed 1 square of a 6 square push into a stone wall and have 5 squares of movement to go you take 5d4 damage. Players loved it since most of the powers they were using had them knocking mobs through the air. 

Anywhoo look forward to hearing some of yours and hopefully I can integrate some of them into my games!

**Preface and Sample Size**

What started out as a brief thought I had regarding player alignment preference ended up as a survey.  I anticipated I'd get about 80-90 responses in a week, and ended up with 1,001 in less than 24 hours.  Turns out, Survey Monkey will only show the first 100 responses to a free account, so I had to fork out $24 to get the rest of the results (up to 1,000).  I wish I could have left it open longer, but anything after 1,000 costs me $0.15 per person so I had to cut it off there.  I apologize to anyone who didn't get to answer the survey in time; it's not that I don't value your input, I just didn't want a huge credit card bill. :)  I'd like to take the time to thank everyone who answered the survey.  I personally posted this survey to /r/DnD, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, and /r/RPG, as well as Facebook.  I'm not sure if anyone sent it out to anyone else, but if you did, thanks!

*(Sidenote – I was told that Google Docs will let you conduct large surveys/polls for free.  I'll keep this in mind in the future, I didn't want to start over on Google Docs and risk ignoring the data of those who had already responded)*

**Expectations of Data/Perceived Sampler Bias**

My belief going into this was that I expected Chaotic Neutral to be the most popular alignment, followed perhaps by True Neutral and Neutral Good.  I expected that all three Evil alignments would most likely be the bottom 3 results, since most DMs shy away from allowing evil PCs, for various reasons.

I run a homebrew classic D&amp;D game. We were about a year (real time) into it, and had a TPK. Since everyone was starting new characters, and I didn't want to level the new ones back up with the same stuff we'd already gone through, I integrated [Thunder Rift](http://garysentus.blogspot.com/2009/10/black-sheep-thunder-rift.html) into my campaign world, and ran my group through the bulk of the published adventures TSR put out for that setting. It all culminated with the party being teleported to the other side of the world, and they have finally made it back to their home continent (and as such, back to the stuff I write instead of published adventures). 

They have completed level one of the dungeon they've currently been exploring, and I thought I'd share it with you guys. I'll be posting one level at a time, after my players have completed it (some of them are Redditors, so I don't want to spoil it for 'em). It's written for classic (B/X, BECMI, RC), but should easily convert to whatever system you want, just insert appropriate monster stats. I've left out the intro part of it, as well, as it is specific to my campaign. The big-bad of this place is a green dragon, so use whatever reason fits your party/campaign to get your group here. 

Finally, the setting is a stone quarry that's build into the base of a mountain, part of which were used as a temple of Loki after the mines were abandoned until they were found and eradicated (Loki's worship is outlawed, change this for whatever fits your game).


**The Valdhum Mines - Level 1, The Quarry**

[Map](http://i.imgur.com/R9mwZ.jpg)


**1.)** The walls are mostly earth, with large wooden support beams throughout. Old, empty boxes and crates stacked along the walls. Broken mine carts on rusted and broken tracks that lead off into the mines. Old broken masonry tools and bits of rock litter the floors.

**2.)** A wooden structure has been build in this room, essentially a wall with a door that partitions off an office. Pegs along the north wall with old mining gear hung on it.

**3.)** This room functioned as the foreman’s office. There is an old rotted desk and chair here, with a few papers strewn across the desktop. They seem to be old accounting papers, and are now worthless. If the desk is thoroughly searched, a small lockbox can be found. It is locked and trapped, poisoned needle with old weak poison, 2d6 damage save for half. Inside the box is a chunk of gold ore worth 1,500gp.

**4.)** This was the miner’s barracks. Old, rotted cots are scattered about. After one turn of searching, the party turns up 5cp. They are then attacked by huge wood spiders that were clinging to the ceiling (if the party states they check the ceiling when first entering, they will notice the spiders).

**Huge Wood Spiders (4)** : AC 6; HD 1+3* (S); hp 10, 9, 8, 7; MV 120’ (40’); #AT 1 bite; THAC0 18; Dmg 1d6 + poison; Save as F1; ML 8; AL N; XP 19 each; save vs. poison with +2 or take 1d8 points of damage and become sluggish for 2d4+2 rounds (-2 initiative and move half).

**5.)** This was the kitchen. Large vented fireplace in the south wall. Table with stacked pots and pans along the east wall. If anyone pokes around in the chimney, it will disturb a group of bats who fly around the room for one round and then fly back into the chimney and out of the cave. As the bats are flying around, they will knock over a pot that has a colony of yellow mold growing in it, causing it to release its spores. Anyone within 10 feet of the table takes 1d6 points of damage, and must save vs. death or choke to death in 6 rounds. If the bats aren’t disturbed and the party searches, they’ll spot the mold before disturbing it.

**Yellow Mold**: AC can always be hit; HD 2* (L); hp 10; MV nil; #AT Spores; THAC0 NA; Dmg 1d6 + special; Save as F2; ML NA; AL N; XP 25.

**6.)** If this mineshaft is searched, a small copper ring is found. It is a Ring of Delusion. The wearer of the ring will believe that it is a ring of animal control, and will be convinced of this until a remove curse is cast on them.

**7.)** This mine shaft is littered with desiccated woodland animal corpses. If the party makes it all the way to the end of the shaft, a group of giant hunting spiders burst out of their hiding spots in the earthen walls, in between the party and the main shaft.

**Giant Hunting Spiders (8)**: AC 8; HD 2 (M); hp 13, 12, 10, 10, 8, 8, 7, 7; MV 120’(40’); #AT 1 bite; THAC0 18; Dmg 1d6; Save as F2; ML 7; AL N; XP 20 each.

**8.)** Leading up to this area the party notices a strong odor of death. When they enter, they find this area is now the lair of a pair of grizzly bears. Old animal corpses strewn about. There is a 25% chance the bears will be asleep when the party arrives (if the party has been loud, the bears won’t be asleep).

**Bear, grizzly (2)**: AC 8; HD 5 (L); hp 24, 23; MV 120’ (40’); #AT 2 claw 1 bite; THAC0 15; Dmg 1d8/ 1d8/ 1d10; Save as F4; ML 10; AL N; XP 175 each.

**9.)** A small band of goblins has taken this small area as their lair. The entrance has a small, poorly built wooden barricade in place; the party will see this as they approach the room. When they’re about ten feet away, they’ll hear in goblin, “Back off, woodsmen, this is our home now. You have your own place!” If the party talks to the goblins, they’ll learn that the mines don’t extend much past this area, the goblins have been here for about 5 years and keep to themselves, and that if the party is looking to explore the mines, their best bet is the “up and down ride” (area 11). The goblins will gladly give the party the lever needed to operate the elevator in area 11 if they promise to leave the goblins alone. If the party is aggressive, the goblins will fight to defend their home.

**Goblins (20)**: AC 6; HD 1-1 (S); hp 4 each; MV 90’ (30’); #AT 1 weapon; THAC0 20; Dmg 1d6 (spear); Save as NM; ML 9; AL C; XP 5 each.

**10.)** Small piles of goblin bedding line the hallway leading to this area. This is where the goblins keep their “hoard.” There is a total of 10gp, 58sp, 73cp, and a large (2’ long, 4” diameter) wooden rod (used to operate the elevator in area 11).

**11.)** The whole northern wall is made of cut stones. The ceiling in this area is taller than in the rest of the place, about 20’. A large shaft, roughly 10’ diameter, leads upwards from the ceiling. If the party searches, they’ll find a 4” diameter hole in the wall. The wooden rod from area 10 fits in this hole, and when the lever is pulled, an elevator will drop down from above. When the lever is pushed back up, the elevator lifts. Note that players will have to push the lever up and get on the elevator, leaving the rod behind and in the up position. The lift goes up about 50’. About halfway up, the shaft turns from earth to stone work. If there are goblins left behind in room 9, they will come retrieve the lever after the party uses it, leaving them stranded on the next level with the elevator in the up position.

1344331500.0,125,self.DnD,xtdz6,I recently convinced my 'girly' girlfriend to play DnD with me and my friends. Here's a report.,birdoxer,151,26,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/xtdz6/i_recently_convinced_my_girly_girlfriend_to_play/,"Before I tell you how this went, you should know something about my girlfriend: She is neither a 'geek' nor a 'nerd', if anything she is more of a 'girly' girl, that, nonetheless, likes to play video games on her ps3 on a quite regular basis (although I wouldn't go as far as to call her a 'gamer'). So, naturally (i.e. with the stigma fantasy roleplaying games have among the people that never actually played them), she was always like ""oh my god, you are such a freak"", when I told her about the 6 hour sessions I regularly had with my friends playing Descent. When our little group decided to get into DnD, it was nearly too much for her. She would say things like ""Now, are you going to dress up as a monk and carry a staff around with you all the time or what?"" and was genuinely concerned that playing DnD would turn me into some kind of person that would constantly LARP around shouting ""Lightning Bolt!"" at random people in the streets.

After another day of taking her shit about how freaky DnD is, I told her that she should play an adventure, or at least one single session with us before she makes another one of those remarks about it, because, honestly, she didn't have a fucking clue what she was talking about. Of course, she refused. But then I told her, that DnD is basically the same as her favourite games on the ps3, namely Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim. You have certain classes and races and get features according to them, you have perks (feats) that you gain more of as you level up and you have skills (e.g. lockpicking in Skyrim/Fallout etc) that you can also improve when leveling up. Just like in Fallout, there's skill checks of speech (diplomacy/bluff/intimidate) and the like and apart from the pretty epic combat system with lots of spells and powers and what not you also have to talk to people in towns to obtain quests or gather new info about quests you already possess. I basically accused her of being a hypocrite if she says she really likes games like Fallout and Skyrim, but then that DnD is something only freaks would do.

Hence, she ultimately agreed to start an adventure with me as the DM and, although it was really obvious she wanted to hide it, I could tell she was even looking forward to it. When we were making her character, she really did a bad job at hiding her excitement, as she spent hours finding pictures of a female Tiefling Warlock (she picked Tiefling immediately because they looked 'sexy and evil') and creating her personality traits and mannerisms and the like. She even came up with a pretty elaborate backstory, namely that she was abandoned in the fey woods as a baby and was adopted by Eladrin who taught her the ways in magic. However, she was also constanly mocked by the 'arrogant' high-elves and, when she was 18 she even killed an Eladrin out of rage after being mocked by him. Thus she got banned and had to live alone in the woods for 2 years where the rest of the adventurers party pick her up and the adventure begins. She also said, that she would 'smell of wild flowers' because she is pretty much constantly smoking them in a pipe she carved out of forest wood herself. Even though some of the things she came up with didn't perfectly fit into the DnD Lore, I was still really proud and happy that she put so much effort into her character, completely giving up any sort of pretence of finding DnD stupid.

When it came to actually playing the game, she - again, quite naturally - had a slowish start, because I had to explain to her how combat/powers work and what she could do or not do and that she could pretty much try anything she wanted and I as the DM would try to incorporate it into the story some how. Also the amount of Roleplaying was a little bit too much for her at the beginning:

When the other party members met her character for the first time this conversation happened: My friend's Dragonborn: ""Watch out, my friends, I spot a creature watching us, hiding in the woods!"" After approaching her character and seeing it was a Tiefling ""A Tiefling? Here in the woods? How did an individual of your brave and tenacious race find its way into these elven woods?"" My girlfriend stared at my friend playing the Dragonborn, then at me and finally asking ""What do I say?"". I responded ""Whatever you like! You have a backstory, choose to share it or not. Lie or tell the truth, whatever you want."" She looked at me with a hint of panic in her eyes and said ""You told me it was gonna be like Fallout! In Fallout you get to choose what you want to say from preset options...I want that!"". Ahh, cute. After explaining to her that it was one of the best things in DnD that you can literally say and do whatever you want - if you're willing to face the consequences - she eventually explained to the other party members why she was living in the forest and so on; still some conversations were a little stiff (""So, Eilatra the Wild, what do you say: Will you join us and exterminate the Kobold plague around Winterhaven?"" - ""Yes!""), but as time went on she really got the hang of it. The things she enjoyed most was messing with the people in the towns, for example have the tavernist list all the beer and wines they have to offer just to order a cup of water, or stealing the tips people left on their tables. She even stole a healing potion when the shopkeeper was busy bargaining with one of the other party members (she focused on Thievery, Stealth, Bluff and stuff like that, with alignment evil) and I could tell how excited she was when rolling the d20 to see if she gets away with it or not.

After we ended the session and went home together she wouldn't stop talking about how she didn't like the Eladrin party member, and thought he was a stuck up prick, whereas she was thinking of trying to get with the Dragonborn. It was really surreal how her entire attitude towards DnD changed from being so stereotypically negative to being completely swept away by its sheer awesomeness.
I know it was a perfect ""toldya"" moment, however I kept it to myself and let her enjoy it without me giving her some petty bullshit for being wrong about DnD and blahblah.
We're having another session on Saturday, she's already really excited.

I did some calculations, and the party will be able to dig a tunnel at 30 degrees from the vertical (enough to be able to crawl out) in just under 15 minutes.

Most awesome critical hit stories are like this in the first place. I bet some of you guys have some ridiculous stories of combat and trial. I want to hear them.

As for myself, last night I was playing my new Barbarian that I had built because my archer was executed by the party for being a mole. Anyway, in the world we're in, it's our human forces (and some gnolls we tricked with meat and prestidigitation) vs. a giant fortress of orcs, ogres, and some mages.

We sneak some people inside as ""prisoners"" and tell the king of the orcs, Stormhammer, that they should send their champion out in single combat vs. our single champion. This massive orc in full plate with a glowing red and black axe, motherfucker's name was Doom-Axe, tells the king that he'll fight their measly human champion.

In comes Stanley Yelnats, a former farmer from a town called Gabriel that was actually burnt down by my former elf archer... anywho, it's decided that my character is gonna roll with Doom-Axe.

I start marching across the field toward the fortress with the giant orc waiting outside. I know that their siege weapons can obliterate me with magic in an instant, but, I'm just one motherfucker so I hoped they'd let the fight happen. 

I get to 60' away from Doom-Axe and we roll for initiative. I go first. I immediately whirling frenzy AND frenzy, while also bull's strengthed, bringing my level 7 barbarian up to 38 strength. I charge and pounce Doom-Axe with a Valorous Keen Scythe for 118 damage, dropping him to 2 hit points in my first charge. I use my Intimidating Rage and manage a high roll, which is probably what saved my life.

What proceeded was perhaps the most aggravating thing I've ever gone through as a player of d&amp;d. I'm at 67 health to start, Doom-Axe takes his three attacks and drops me to half health. The DM tells me that I notice some of his wounds closing. In the ensuing melee, both me and Doom-Axe missed (almost)all of our attacks in the next *two rounds*. I missed every attack I rolled against this guy. I had  +15/+15/+10 a round to hit and I missed every single swing. Fucker hits me for 17, and again for 15, bringing *me* down to 2HP and things are looking desperate because he's healing as he strikes me down. Until he rolls a NAT 1 and critical misses, sending his axe into the dirt 15 feet away.

I remember I have improved trip.

I hit his touch and send him sprawling, and as he's on the ground I'm *still missing all of my attacks*. I have one attack left at a +10 bonus (his AC must have been a 28 or something honestly) and I was having very little faith in myself. Was I going to have to roll *another* character because of shitty dice rolls? I was *really* looking forward to keeping the barbarian hard charger around.

Somewhat drunk and incredibly frustrated, hoping against anything that I could simply *kill this fuck*, I plead to the dice. I begin personalizing them, and they are fickle mistresses. ""I spent money on you!"" I tell them. I say that they're special, that I won't roll any dice but them for as long as I live. Just get Stanley out of here alive! I prostrate myself and let the dice fly.

NAT 20. 

I confirm that x4 crit. 

It was enough damage to send him to -4 from full health. His wounded, prone body was no match for Stanley's vehement fury.

I bring my scythe down through the top of his helmet, dragging it down through his torso and out of his groin, spending my remaining frenzied rounds eviscerating his corpse and staining the field around me with blood, roaring my battle cry atop the pile of flesh.

I grab the axe from the field and sprint back to the defensive line around the fort, screaming the entire time.

turns out Doom-Axe was a level 12 Fighter at that point in combat. Stanley's first kill got him a level.

**TL;DR my lvl7 barbarian Stanley rolls against lvl12 orc fighter Doom-Axe and pulls out a victory by the skin of his teeth**

1370069528.0,120,self.DnD,1fgcsb,Tired of one-dimensional Dwarves? I wrote an alternate history/breakdown! (Warning: Long),eL_Jacho,149,29,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1fgcsb/tired_of_onedimensional_dwarves_i_wrote_an/,"Dwarves and legends around them have existed for time immemorial.  Foreign, innumerable, and world-encompassing, the ancient places famously built underground by the first Dwarven explorers make their first societies one of the best recorded ancient civilizations.  Though much of the early generations of “Southern Societies” have been lost over time, the Dwarf-founded city states pride themselves on being heirs to the greatest lineage in history.

Dwarf societies are difficult to measure in longevity due to inaccurate or a total absence of record keeping as well as how damn dangerous the Underground is.  What is clear is that many of the oldest tunnels Underground that still function all appear to be hewn in a similar fashion and were all marked with a form of stone writing that has been lost for millennia.  Unlike other ancient societies, the ones who made these tunnels chose never to depict themselves in ancient carvings, choosing instead to depict local monsters or geographic features in wall carvings that span miles in some places.  Dwarf scholars refer to these people as Wylenirs, which means “Explorers” in ancient Dwarven.

What is known with certainty is how Dwarves were the first (to the best of regional academia’s knowledge and many are—coincidentally—Dwarven) to establish sustainable city-states in a style similar to that of surface societies.  After learning to master underground beasts that could be harvested for meat and farming fungal sprouts and edible plants that feed on chemosynthesis, dwarves appear to have migrated from somewhere on the surface and laid the groundwork for more “Southern Roads” and cities between them than any other race in existence.

“Race,” is used lightly in this context, because the Underground cities were and are some of the most diverse places in the world.  Humans, elves, gnomes, and species of every kind that can talk have found themselves in a Dwarven city once or twice, though often not willingly.

“The Dwarf Trade” refers to the chain of commerce that connects some of the deepest places underground with the highest mountains on the surface.  In fact, Dwarven coins are called “marks” because it is the standard most often used by other nations/regions as well as other neighboring Dwarf cities.  In fact, it is because of the Dwarf Trade that almost every sentient creature has an attraction to metal coins and precious gems; they are made common and valuable because there is such a stable infrastructure that finds it valuable and almost everyone is connected to it.  However, the Dwarf Trade is typically avoided in polite conversation on account of half of it being supported by the backs of slaves.

“Hostage” derives from the Dwarf word “Hlosdaagi” meaning “chained guest.”  Throughout history, territory Underground was hard to win and harder to maintain.  Because of this, Dwarves would often kidnap intruders in their territory and “hold them” until a neighboring city state would negotiate for a captive’s release.  Those who were never negotiated for were remanded into the local servant caste.

The largest problem arose with the arrival of a massive Drow Exodus from the surface spearheaded by a military commander known as Lilith or Lolth.  An apostate Cleric of the God of Elves, she served as an intractable military commander and violently carved out several pockets in the Underground for her people, but many of those pockets were founded on the ruins of Dwarven cities.  Known to scholars as the “Centuries of Strife” amounted to roughly a single Dwarf or Elven generation and equal to hundreds of human years and consisted of bitter, bloody fighting between Dwarves and Drow that ended with the signing of the “Charter of Personage,” which outlined territories, rights of negotiation, and prisoner exchange between warring cities regardless of differing racial demography.  It was this formal “Exchange” that formalized captured people of all races as things to be quantified, borrowed, and used for profit.

The Charter of Personage started a tradition where Dwarven and Elven miners, adventurers, and mercenaries would be captured in enemy territory and conscripted into labor groups occasionally for years a time.  When a city was in sore need of labor the price of these hostages would be too costly for any city-state to pay for.  However, as is the case with slaving societies overcrowding can be a serious issue, so when an overabundance is reached the crowded city will have a “sale” and massive numbers of people will be traded to neighboring cities (Dwarf and Elf alike) and hostages can be returned to their homes or—if no one is there to claim them—they are sold to someone else.  Whenever the Charter is honored Elves and Dwarves in the Underground profit immensely from it, and for this reason many Dwarf and Elf cities have better relations than more homogenous and less “business savvy” allies.

It was also this business relationship that led to the start of a new species and society altogether: the Duergar.  Known to non-local peoples as “Deep Dwarves,” “Dark Dwarves,” or “Evil Dwarves,” Duergar originally entered the fold as half-dwarf, half-drow offspring produced by the many hostages in Dwarf and Elven cities alike.  To maintain cultural traditions and avoid an unseemly union between two groups who were [officially] political enemies, Duergar origins are flatly denied by almost everyone in power, even if it’s painfully obvious as to how they got there.  While they received markedly less discrimination in many Drow cities, Duergar were nevertheless denied full citizenship on account of them only being partly Drow.   While—to this day—Duergar districts are a hallmark of any Dwarf or Drow City, most of the outcast Duergar fled to the Underground and journeyed into even harsher climates and founded cities of their own called Bulwarks.  A steady rise of Duergar Bulwarks with prominent armies has forced many Drow and Dwarf politicians to push for more rights and privileges for Duergar citizens to help stave off an outright war or uprising.  The last thing Drow or Dwarves want is an assault in their backyard from their actual relatives, but many authorities in these city-states are hesitant to open their doors to Duergar on account of many being outwardly against the Dwarf Trade and subjugation altogether.  The dynamics between these people has led to a veritable hotbed of political debate and intrigue that has led to bouts of outright violence on the streets of many cities Underground.

Another matter for contention exists between the Dwarves and the Gnomish Principality of Yallerwust.  Famous for its isolation and secret trade routes that were almost as valuable as the goods they carried, it stood for many years as an example of successful isolationism.  When an Illithid compound using thralls accidentally stumbled upon one of these secret routes, entire merchant caravans were captured and the Gnomes were used to mine quicksilver ore, and the Illithids realized that Gnomes—above any other race—could survive handling the poisonous material better than anyone.  The mining always poisoned the blood and left many mentally feeble afterwards, but a Gnome’s innate resistances allowed them to mine for more than triple the time any other intelligent race could survive the extraction process.

Dwarf and Drow cities have few official public relations with Illithids on account of their negative reputations, but the discovery of what Gnomes were capable of skyrocketed their value in the Dwarf Trade to such high measures that it was financially impossible for the Principality of Yallerwust to buy back all of its missing citizens.  It wasn’t until Dwarf emissaries from the Goldvayne outright refused to negotiate with Yallerwust for any Gnome Hostages.  Instead, the emissaries offered to sell back the “criminals” after their prison sentences had been fulfilled in the mines.  Since she knew that working in the mines left most that were exposed weak and mentally feeble, Ysolde declared war on the Dwarf Trade itself and began financing a vicious guerilla war against any and all slave traders.  Ysolde even started backing Drow and Dwarf politicians to push harder for an end to the Trade as well as the vicious caste system.  After hearing of Ysolde’s declaration, Goldvayne has called for a Charter Council to convene and strike the entire Gnome race from the Charter of Personage and brand them as “not trade-worthy.”  

**A Silver Lining**

Now, these events only highlight political tensions in one region of the world and do not represent all of Dwarf kind as a whole.  In fact, the farther “northward” travels the less prevalent the Hostage system is in traditionally Dwarven cities.  This is most obvious in cities and keeps that are in the mountains and live closer to surface folk than they do to other Dwarven holds.  With less dependence on hard, Underground labor, many Northern enclaves simply purchase grain and food from the surface and forego inducting a Hostage caste altogether.  To many dwarves in these regions, the Hostage system itself is often scorned on account of its potential for brutality and political unease.   While outspoken, these mountain holds are typically poorer than their southern counterparts (and gain most of their money from trading Southward goods with on the surface), and thus have less influence during Charter Councils.  As one Charter master representing some southward Dwarves remarked, “If you find our standards beneath your sun-burned standards, then stop wearing our armor and return our gold.”

Given the nature of traditionalism and the solidarity among Underground cultures, dynamics such as these are most often unheard of on the surface because of misconceptions between the two worlds.  The standards for survival are so much harder to come by when not living under a sun that helps one grow crops, strict measures in times of desperation are so common, the common word “discipline” comes from the dwarf phrase “Descurn ip-Allyn,” meaning “Acting as one Must.”  The phrase has become so common that even the Drow have a similar phrase “Yishil Solla ru hin Durakka” roughly translated as “Dwarves don’t hold their lines for stupid reasons.”

**Charters and Kings**

Royalty is more common in Northward civilizations and less and less common the farther southward one travels Underground.  While the very old cities like Goldvayne do have royalty descended from ancient lines, the most common method for rule revolve around Charters (also known as Guilds).  With life and crises changing constantly and with little warning, Dwarves were desperate for way to act quickly with a majority consensus without abdicating all power to a sole Queen or dictator.  So, the Charter system became popular for its speed in action as well as its consensus from the majority.

When a Judge or Lawgiver expresses a formal NEED, organizations or Charters will petition to take responsibility to meet the city’s needs.  When a city in its infancy needs people to guard the city, a Charter will be given to the group deemed most suitable.  Charters also help stave off corruption, as income and resource allocation are all spelled out in the charter before it’s signed, and any Charter House will display its contract in a special room specifically for business and prospective employees called a Daimont.  Kings and royalty never got the foothold in the early Dwarven societies that surface cultures did, and because of this many Dwarves (especially Southward Dwarves) view powerful monarchies with suspicion and lack of oversight.  In almost every Dwarven city there exists a council where representatives of each charter convene to discuss tactics and encourage cohesion, and these representatives are called Charter masters.

As was previously mentioned, Charters are not the absolute rule of law.  Some cities do—in fact—have kings and functioning monarchies, but even the most powerful kings will make some kind of proclamation that as kings or queens they are simply a “master of all charters,” so they can negotiate with other charters abroad for better trade or military assistance.

Because of frequent military conflict and high exchange of hostages, Dwarves living in Drow cities have even established Charters of their own to better facilitate trade between city-states.  Since not every dwarf makes it back to their home in a timely fashion, it isn’t uncommon for a Dwarf Hostage to spend years working for the Drow or for Drow to spend years working for Dwarves.  Some Mercenary and Explorer charters even prefer to employ former Hostages because the time spent in captivity can grant a better understanding of a potential enemy in a dangerous environment.  To formalize a long term peace agreement, two feuding states might exchange royal family members as Honored Hostages for decades at a time.  In some cases, Drow cities have been known to hire entire Dwarf Charters to bolster their forces either to fend off enemies or smooth over a military junta.  What’s more, it’s actually a sign of high status among Dwarves and Drow to have a high ranking official of the opposite race serve as an attendant.  

tl;dr Dwarf society is incredibly complex, violent, intricate, and filled with varying degrees of awe and horror that perfectly reflects the environment in which they thrive.

1356910360.0,122,self.DnD,15p0re,Stealing Immortality: Lost in Limbo (Part 14),,193,71,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/15p0re/stealing_immortality_lost_in_limbo_part_14/,"Alright, I'm finally out of the hospital after struggling with a nasty case of pneumonia and able to use my PC again! Still feel like crap and I'm in pain, but you guys have been patiently waiting for 14, and so I will deliver it. There'll be a special guest appearance with Z, as he drove me home (like a goddamn maniac while blaring the Sex Pistols) and is still around! I'll put a comments down below of his reactions to various comments on his antics and a few of my own questions for him, so feel free to ask any questions you may have.

There were a few comments on part 13 about dropping Steve's God into a fissure, primarily about how it wasn't nearly as awesome as the other feats thus far. As said in Z's words, ""No way was I dealing with that bastard. People needed to be raised left and right with the kobold, and after he nearly killed Steve with a nut shot, there was no way I was going to put up with his shit."" I'd also like to clear up that there were a few other checks; the dropping of the gold counted as a compel effect, being covered in oil gave him a penalty to not falling in, and another penalty to holding on when he did fall in. He had another save that would have enraged him, where he would have climbed right up the cliff and most likely pounded us to dust. There was another check against confusion or something like it, where he would have noticed he was about to fall into the bowels of the earth and done something about it. I believe there was also another check for ""swimming"" over to the cliff wall for a second chance at a grab and climb check. (Though that might have been tied into the last one I mentioned.) The dice were against Chris, and he failed everything.

And if there was any potential confusion about exactly how he split the ground open, he was a God. He literally called down the lightning on Kobolds, granted he had penalties due to his intelligence and wisdom not being optimal and his stolen Godhood was from a water plane guy. The fissure also counted as consuming several casts instead of just one, and he would have lost a few turns after it. They were literally banking entirely on this working, and it did. They were lucky bastards.

Anyway, when we last left off, the dwarf God was dead, and Steve had joined Z and Chainsaw in their Godhood. We were rolling off on who would go next, and it was Jay's turn to pick a God to slay.

Chris: ""Alright, before we go any further, I'm banning using Z as a resource. There will be no more conspiring with him to drop Gods. Naturally he can assist, but I don't want any more meetings out of game to do shit like that. That was a load of bullshit and the both of you fucking know it.""

Z: ""I don't think I've ever heard that many vulgarities out of you before.""

Chris: ""Yeah, well, I'm serious this time. This is the second God you've dropped before he could do anything. I was expecting something clever, but that was some goddamn bullshit.""

Steve: ""I can see where you're coming from with that. In hindsight it *was* pretty cheap.""

Jay: ""So because Z helped make a mockery of your encounters by being an evil mastermind, you're leaving the rest of us to our own devices? Good luck, Heidi. You're going to need it.""

Z: ""She cheated the Deck of Many Things all by herself. I think she'll be just fine. More worried about you, Jay. I could never figure out exactly what you were thinking, but are you still clever enough to play one over on Chris after all these years?""

Jay: ""Is that a challenge, boy?""

Z: ""Maybe it is.""

Jay: ""Three turns max and whatever God I pick is down.""

Z: ""Throw a dart at a piece of paper listing the remaining Gods and I'll put $100 on it.""

Jay: ""Deal.""

The list was made and tacked to the dart board. We blindfolded Jay and let him throw. And then the unthinkable happened. He took off his blindfold after throwing the dart, and all the blood drained from his face.

Asmodeus.

Jay: ""NOPE. Take the Benjamin.""

Z: ""I don't want it until you've led us down to the bottom layer of hell to fight him. You can give it to me after he rips your face off.""

Steve: ""Is Asmodeus even statted? I don't think anyone would be dumb enough to fight him. Doesn't his blood turn into pit fiends or something?""

Chris: ""Yeah, he's statted. You don't even want to know how tough this guy is.""

Jay: ""Shut up and take the money. I'm not fighting him. No way.""

Z: ""Alright, fine. Throw again.""

And once again he was blindfolded and tossing darts. Erythnul.

Jay: ""Alright, what's this guy do?""

Chainsaw: ""Drives you insane by looking at you or swinging his hammer. Just getting to him may drive you insane. There's also Loki and some other dude that share a part of the plane above him, which is the easiest to move around in.""

Jay: ""Alright, let's do Loki and the other guy. Two birds with one stone.""

Heidi: ""The other guy is Auril, some winter woman. The plane they're on is an endless winter... place.""

Jay: ""Well... shit. We can't work with Z anymore?""

Chris: ""Nope.""

Heidi: ""Can you make an exception? There are two Gods here now.""

Chris: ""Hmmm... you can ask him questions. Z, your answers can only be one word.""

Jay and I were going to be the two to take them on. Jay would fight Loki, and I'd take Auril. The game with Z began, which was fairly difficult to work with. We're lucky Chris gave us a break, because the oncoming fight would be incredibly difficult. It was a long conversation, but we managed to get an idea together.

Jay: ""Loki's a shapeshifter, and Auril has an affinity for cold. What do we do with Loki?""

Z: ""Identify.""

Me: ""How do we do that?""

Z: ""Scent.""

Jay: ""Scent? What do you mean, scent?""

Z: ""Companion.""

Jay: ""Right, summoning animal companions. But if we got a dog or something, we'd need to keep it alive and get Loki's scent before we fought him.""

Z: ""Trickery.""

Chainsaw: ""He's the God of trickery. The dog could sniff out illusions he creates. But if he sees us climbing his mountain thing, he'll attack for sure. What do we do to get his scent?""

Z: ""Us.""

Me: ""Brilliant. There's not going to be much of a scent in a winter wasteland. So if he knows *our* scents, he'll go after whatever doesn't smell like us. Is that what you're getting at?""

Z: ""Yep.""

Jay: ""Alright, it only took an hour, but we've got a plan.""

Heidi: ""Loki and Auril share the realm, though. What if Auril comes to help?""

Z: ""Lightning.""

Heidi: ""Why lightning?""

Z: ""Metal.""

Heidi: ""... What?""

Z: ""Fire.""

Heidi: ""An electrical fire?""

Jay: ""That's pretty clever. But how do we conjure an electrical fire?""

Z: ""Godhood.""

Chainsaw: ""Alright, so we identify Loki with a dog and beat the shit out of him. Heidi, take care of the dog. If and when Auril comes along, we do some God stuff and conjure trees wrapped in metal and nail it with lightning. That'll heat up the wires and hopefully ignite the trees. That'll keep Auril busy for a round or two, right?""

Steve: ""Why aren't we using fire?""

Z: ""Melt.""

Steve: ""Right, the ice would melt if we hurled fireballs everywhere... I'll be on tree duty. Chainsaw can do metal, and Z can do lightning. We good?""

Jay: ""Alright, let's roll out. Can he talk normally now?""

Chris: ""Yeah, I guess.""

Jay: ""Where do you put our chances with this plan?""

Z: ""Well, since you guys pieced it together and I can't tell you *my* plan due to Chris being a jerk, I'd say the chances are low if we follow this exactly.""

Chris: ""Wait... you gave them a horrible plan?""

Z: ""Essentially, yes. There's two other Gods now. They can handle it while I do my thing. Just do what you guys have and I'll do my thing. I've got this.""

Chainsaw: ""Can we at least get a general idea?""

Z: ""Well, I tricked Ormet, another God of trickery, so what's another one? Granted Ormet was mortal, but that's what makes Loki so much more fun. He'll probably read us his memoirs before he attacks, anyway. Plenty of time to work it.""

Steve: ""A bit nervous about this if you gave us a shit plan. But I'll trust you to do your thing.""

Z: ""It's not a shit plan, it's just... lacking.""

Jay: ""Well, let's put the lacking plan to use, then."" 

With that, we made our way to Pandemonium and began making our way through the winding, endless tunnels until we reached what we were looking for.

Z: ""How cold is it?""

Chris: ""As cold as a witch's tit. Non-Gods take penalties.""

Heidi: ""Endure elements.""

Chris: ""No more penalties, I suppose.""

We trekked our way to a massive mountain thingy, which we assumed would be where Loki would be. After loads and loads of climb, strength, and dexterity checks, we made it to a small platform. After the last of us had climbed up, Loki faded into view.

Z: ""Welp, there goes the element of surprise.""

Loki: ""Why are you here? You have no reason to be. Go back and I will spare you.""

Jay: ""Nope. We're coming up.""

Chainsaw: ""He's probably an illusion. The real Loki's probably jerking it at the top or something.""

The shade of Loki scowled and disappeared.

Z: ""Yeah... I don't like that.""

Steve: ""Me neither. That's... not good. Not good at all. He knows we're here now, and that we know what he does. He could stomp on us.""

Chris: ""As you debate what to do in this situation, a barely audible rumbling comes from within the mountain. It gets louder and louder until a massive bug-like creature crashes through the rock. It stands on four legs and has a light blue carapace that blends in with the surrounding snow. The legs are all bladed at the tips, and its mouth oozes with venom that sizzles through the rock below it.""

Z: ""Great. We're dealing with a giant bug that spits HF. It could be an illusion, but we should probably beat the shit out of it anyway.""

Chris: ""As you question whether or not it's an illusion, it lets out a blood-curdling scream and slashes at the rock beneath your feet, which is sliced into three pieces and begins to slide and fall down the mountain as you just barely dodge the blow.""

Z: ""It's like a Sephiroth bug that drools HF.""

Steve: ""... If it's a Sephiroth bug, Jenova bug isn't far behind, is it?""

Jay: ""Great, put some more murderous bug thing ideas in his head. Why don't you recommend tentacle monsters next?""

Z: ""Don't be stupid, tentacle monsters need Japanese schoolgirls to survive. Not many schoolgirls would be passing through here, would they?""

And with that, initiative was rolled and weapons were drawn as the battle with the giant Sephiroth bug began!

Aaaand we'll leave off there. Like I said before, Z is here if you want to ask him things. I'll be posting a few reactions to some comments in the comments on this thread, so stay tuned.

1354208672.0,120,self.DnD,1401iy,Deja Vu: How to get double the play-time out of your encounter,plki76,132,12,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1401iy/deja_vu_how_to_get_double_the_playtime_out_of/,"Ran my PCs through this one recently and thought I'd share. :-)

Many campaigns flirt with alternate realities, dream sequences, and/or time travel. All of these are great devices for one of my favorite tricks: the Deja Vu encounter.

Deja Vu encoutners are when you run the PCs through a series of events that they've experienced before, but with a small twist. The major advantage is that you get to save yourself a lot of prep time. My players also (usually :-) ) find this trick fun if it's not overdone since it lets them ""legally metagame"".

So here's what you do. The PCs approach a [dungeon/temple/space ship/whatever]. They are stopped just outside the temple by a barrier and a voice. ""Help me, stalwart adventurers! I am trapped, compelled to act in evil ways. Say my name and free me!""

The PCs will be baffled and probably think this is some kind of riddle. They cannot successfully answer the question. After a few moments of trying the voice will give up in despair and the barrier will go away.

The PCs enter the structure and see a big-bad boss guy guarding whatever Macguffin the PCs are currently seeking. Near the boss is a prisoner of some powerful race (angels are good to use here). The boss monologs for a few moments and calls out ""[Name of prisoner]! Destroy these fools!"".  The prisoner reluctantly follows the orders as they are compelled to do and combat begins.

Part of the combat should involve deadly traps that activate on certain squares and stealthed enemies that attack from surprise. This should be a hard battle. If you're doing a dream sequence you can even TPK the party here.

The PCs win or lose and go to get the MacGuffin but something happens. A time flux, they wake up from their dream, whatever. Regardless they find themselves back at a previous point in your campaign. I like to end the session here to give the PCs some time to forget details.

Next week you come back and the PCs are confused as to what exactly happened on that space ship, in that temple, or whatever. They will presumably try to go back and figure it out. When they approach the entrance read the exact same description that you did the first time they encountered the barrier and the voice.

If the PCs are lucky, then they have written down or remember the name of the prisoner. If they've forgotten then play hangman to see if they can remember.

They say the name of the prisoner and enter the structure again. Combat will happen again, but this time the prisoner is on their side, they remember where the traps are, and they know about the stealthed monsters. 

This is especially good way to let the players ""redeem themselves"" if you TPK'd them the first time. With the prisoner on their side and knowledge about the traps and stealthed monsters the PCs should be able to overcome the challenge. If you TPK them again, well then they're just doing it wrong. :-)

Anyway, YMMV, but I find this a fun way to mess with my players and also get double-duty out of an encounter that I create. Please let me know if you use this idea and how it turns out!

A story of Tieflings and Tracheotomies (xpost from gametales)",Jolom,140,21,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1bpt3l/that_provokes_right_a_story_of_tieflings_and/,"So I was playing Pathfinder with my best friend as DM, and two guys we met off Reddit. Our party was made up of a Halfling Rogue (played by me), a Human Fighter who wore an armored trench coat, and a Human Cleric who wanted to sex everything.

We were early in our campaign, still level one, and were tasked with finding the King's kidnapped daughter, which we accidentally succeeded in doing. We found her bound and gagged inside a cave surrounded by four Tiefling Rogues, and battle was soon joined. Thanks to some quick thinking, and a few lucky rolls, we quickly dispatched three of the four Tieflings, and we had the last one surrounded. Now here is where the magic started:

DM: ""The Tiefling realizes he is screwed, and Coup de grâces himself with his knife. As you three start to walk towards the princess...""

Cleric: ""Wait, why did he kill himself?""

DM: ""He saw what you did to his friends, and decided to take the easy way out. Anyways...""

Fighter: ""Ah man, I wanted a prisoner...""

Me: ""...Does a Coup de grâce provoke? That provokes, right?""

Laughter around the table.

""No, seriously, I think it does! I attack him!""

DM: ""Wat. Why?""

Me: ""Non-lethal, I want to knock him out!""

DM: ""Ok, sure, but you are at a -4 to hit, so I really doubt...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20.

DM: ""God, I hate you. Ok, confirm.""

I roll again, not so well this time, 15 total, with the Tiefling having 14 AC, as we had learned earlier.

DM: Darn, you only do normal damage. That suc-""

Fighter: ""No no, he crit! We are flanking, so he only took a -2!""

DM: ""That still gives him 13, 1 short. Like I said, that-""

Fighter: ""Bless."" The DM had apparently forgotten the Bless spell cast at the beginning of the fight, which was still very much active.

DM: ""Fine, whatever! You crit, but the Tiefling wasn't hurt, so I doubt-""

Me: ""8. Max damage, doubled, so 16."" 16 was the exact HP of the Tiefling.

DM: ""...I hate all of you.""

So we bound up the Tiefling with the ropes from the princess, and began to head back to the castle, when the DM decided he had not given up. Yet.

DM: ""Alright, since you guys don't have a guide, you will have to roll Survival to see if you can make it back. But be careful, there are Tiefling-eating bears in these woods...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20 from the Fighter.(We had a home-rule that a natural 20 meant automatic success on skill checks, to keep things hilarious and interesting.)

The DM was silent for a second, and then sighed. ""You find your way back perfectly, and avoid all the bears. However..."" The DM started to perk up.

Me: ""I check the Tieflings mouth.""

DM: ""What? Why?""

Me: ""The tiefling just bit his own tongue off so we can't take him alive, didn't he?""

The DM was silent. That was in fact exactly what had just happened.

After a quick healing from our Cleric (We decided that we shoved the tongue back in the mouth and healed the wound) the party realized we had a few options here: We could either make a contraption of a gag so that the Tiefling couldn't bite his tongue but could still breathe; we could have the cleric walk behind him constantly casting Cure Minor Wounds (in Pathfinder level 0 spells can be cast as often as you like) so he couldn't bite through his tongue again, or...

Cleric: ""We are next to a river, right?""

DM: ""Yeah, and?""

Cleric: ""Are there reeds growing there?""

DM: Yeah, sure. Why?""

Cleric: We could preform a tracheotomy! That way, he can't suffocate himself!""

The DM was aghast, and utterly refused to let us try it. We ended up going with a combination of plan A and B, and got our prisoner back to the King for interrogation.

And thus ended the one and only story of competency that our group had.

There isn't going to be a tl;dr. Go cry to your mom if that's a problem for you. ;-)

**To put this post into perspective** 

If you don't care what games i've played or what background i have regarding gaming, you can skip this section and head on down to ""System"", below.

I've GMed various versions of D&amp;D and AD&amp;D pretty heavily from 1982 starting with this [book](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rYv4hYxPiKg/UQQQv3Cc5XI/AAAAAAAABvk/Ln2MOpap2f8/s1600/moldvay-basic1.jpg) to about 1995-ish, and dabbled briefly as both a player and DM with 3.5. 3.x did a lot of good things to the D&amp;D game at the very core of the ruleset with the unified mechanics, but I do taxes for a living, and sitting down to run 3.5 was too much like going to work for me. It was kind of hard to avoid the various chatter online about 3.5, though, so i have a fairly good handle on how the game worked overall.

I bought a bunch of stuff for 4e, and never played it, opting instead to run WFRP 3E a couple of years back. 4E seemed like an ok system, overall, but I'll be honest, tieflings and eladrin and dragonborn and a bunch of the other stuff in the game didn't really resonate with me. I really like the Eberron setting though, go figure.


I have also run numerous other games over the years ranging from Call of Cthulhu, all three editions of WFRP, Exalted, Star Frontiers, GURPS, Cyberpunk 2020, The Riddle of Steel, some Palladium games like Robotech, and, fuck, a bunch of other stuff that isn't immediately leaping to mind. That's just the stuff i've run; i've owned a ton more stuff, both mainstream and indie that never hit the table (waves at Sorcerer).The last decade or so has been pretty light in terms of table top RPGs, but the last little while i've had a hankering to pull out the dice again. Probably because it's spring, and i always want to start an RPG in spring.

Anyway, enough tooting my own horn.

I haven't actually physically playtested D&amp;D Next yet. I would like to, but i don't think that my impressions of the game will vary all that much from what I'm reading at this time. 

I'm not coming from this game with grognard colored glasses, and i'm not coming from some pretentious ""enlightened"" Forge DNS theory point of view either. My concerns are basically ""how well does it ""do"" D&amp;D, does the system look like fun, and double weapons are  a seriously fucking retarded idea.""


**System**

I read the various pdfs basically in order that one would read them if they picked up a game book: ""How to Play"", then ""Character Creation"" and so on.

The text needs to be tightened up and clarified a little bit, but i've seen published stuff that was way messier than this and bordered on incoherent (I'm looking at you, Battlelords of the 23rd Century).


The system has kept the core that made 3.5 great, and culled out a bunch of the shit that i found really irritating like the effectively mandatory requirement of miniatures for combat. I'm not going to get too much into the nitty gritty bits of the system, but i can tell it's going to run smooth and consistent.

The advantage/disadvantage mechanic is brilliant, and is going to be so much easier to use in play than ""D20 (plus your standard bonuses that you've already familiar with and then a bunch of situational modifiers and spells that got cast last round so...) +1 +2 -1 -2 +3 -2.... (two players have their turn) ... oh shit i forgot that +3 from that other spell cast two rounds ago so i actually should have hit"". 

I expect people who get off on all the adding and subtracting and the granularity of d20 based systems aren't going to be happy about this mechanic.  In play, it will be interesting to see how it works, but for now, this mechanic looks to me like a good thing.

I'm a little annoyed by Dex being your basic stealth modifier even if you're just hiding behind a big rock, though. I'm sort of willing to grit my teeth for the sake of mechanical consistency on this, but i don't see why ""dude hiding behind a big rock"" isn't just a contested Int or Wis roll instead. 

*Combat*

I'm breaking this out separately, because hey, combat is pretty important. 

I'm super happy to see a giant grid isn't necessary to run a combat any more. The action mechanic set looks comprehensive and robust without being bogged down in minutia, and there's room to do all kinds of things that aren't covered by a mechanic. Critical hits are streamlined. Damage vulnerability/resistance is simple.

I'm annoyed that opportunity attacks are still around. It's a dumb mechanic that just punishes players for having an unlucky combat round and turns fights into a static slog because nobody wants to move for fear of an opportunity attack, and anyone who's been in a fight with more than one person at a time knows that it isn't particularly ""realistic"". As far as I can tell, pulling the mechanic out only hurts one specific ability of a specific design of the ranger. That's a tradeoff i'm willing to make.


The resting rules and their options make for a nice balance of the 4E healing surges and the 1E ""it takes days or weeks to recover"" mechanics.


**Character stuff in general**

Overall, I like what I see. There's so much support now for actual character concepts that make sense and have meaningful flavor. ""Chain fighter who trips the shit out of people all the time"" is not a character concept. It's just a shitty outgrowth of min-maxed feat selection. 

The stat bonuses for choosing a particular class just makes sense, mechanically and thematically. It's one of those ""why didn't i think of that, it's so simple"" things.

*Backgrounds and Specialties* 

I like these. I like this a lot. Mmmmhmmm. It's about time stuff like this showed up. It's only been 34 years since Traveller raised the torch on this.

Now, the mechanics themselves seem a little off to me at some points at the moment, but overall, the concept and implementation of differentiating my fighter from Joe's fighter with a background and a specialty instead of digging through a mess of convoluted and often broken feats really appeals to me. It's not revolutionary, of course; there was nothing to prevent anyone from saying ""My fighter is a soldier"" in any previous edition of the game, but having it front-loaded and baked in provides a wonderful level of focus for people who are new to the game, and also provides some neat role-playing hooks right out of the tin without having to require the DM or the player to spend a lot of time on it.

*Feats*

Feats are a great idea in theory. In 3.5, though, it felt to me that they ended up being the defining features of various classes, were mainly chosen for their mechanical benefits rather than any other consideration, and so between that and feat-bloat, i never really liked their implementation. 

The feats they have in the playtest are generally nice and flavorful, and i like the way they tied them to the various specialties. Mechanically, some of them seem a little iffy, but that's fine for now.  The optional rule for ""you can choose feats outside your specialty"" also allows for some really interesting class options, like rogues that know a couple of cantrips to help them be extra awesome. I expect them to add more, of course, but hopefully there won't be 8 billion of the damn things six months after release.

*Alignment*

I've gone back and forth in my head over the necessity of having alignment over the years. These days, i've reconciled it to myself as saying ""These are actual metaphysical properties in the D&amp;D universe"" (how else can you *detect evil*?) and i'm comfortable with that. 

**Races**

Good stuff, generally. Nice flavor, and sub races are good, i'm glad they brought those back. I think humans might be getting a little bit of the shit end of the stick here (i honestly have no better ideas though), but i don't think the other races significantly overpower them. I do miss the half-elf and half-orc, but i imagine those should be coming at some point.

**Classes**

I like what they're going overall with the class system in this edition. I'll just talk about a couple, though.

*Fighter* Damn son, I'm pretty impressed with what they've done with the fighter class overall. Good shit all around.

*Barbarian* Ugh, fucking jesus h christ on a moped, still? (**EDIT**: Seems some people don't like that I don't like the barbarian. I talk about that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1f16lw/dd_next_initial_impressions_from_someone_who/ca5sl55), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1f16lw/dd_next_initial_impressions_from_someone_who/ca5ss7z), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1f16lw/dd_next_initial_impressions_from_someone_who/ca5t7iu). **EDIT 2**: And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1f16lw/dd_next_initial_impressions_from_someone_who/ca5x8hm) a whole bunch more). I've never liked the barbarian class, even back in 87 with Unearthed Arcana hit the shelves. It's always been a dumb class (at least in UA it had a little flavor), with a dumb gimmick (""[rar me so angry!](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/3376039680/h1DB95A57/)""), and D&amp;DN hasn't fixed that. I seriously hope this class is still in alpha. Not that it really matters to me at the end of the day, i'm just banning the class because i think it's that dumb. 

*Rogue*  Schemes are awesome. That's all i need to say about that. It always bothered me that thieves basically turned into sneak attack machines post 2e, so it's good to see a bunch of other, more role-play friendly concepts are finally viable in the system.

*Monk* I've always liked the monk. In 1E, it was a serious pain in the ass to play, and had a lot of weird grab bag abilities, but also some cool flavor (quivering palm, anyone?). The class right now definitely needs work, but they're going in the right direction here, i think.

The rest I'm pretty satisfied with conceptually and mechanically overall. Minor tweaks here and there, of course. Hopefully they add the bard in; that's a class that I never play but have a serious soft spot for.




**DM stuff**

Aww yeah, back to the classics, from magic items to monsters. and the best thing? No more stupid giant stat blocks. No more stupid ""treasure by level"". No more stupid CR bullshit. Sure, i could ignore all that stuff other than the stat blocks, but the fact that the designers thought ""we don't trust the DMs of our game to create encounters properly"" was...well, insulting.





**Overall feel and final thoughts**

Having equipment measured in weight, and then having the capacity of backpacks and bags measured in volume needs to be fixed. How many cubic feet does a 50' rope take up? Hell if i know.

This game just feels like old school D&amp;D, but with a slick, modern, transparent and robust system that won't choke under it's own weight.  It doesn't have that ""you need a mechanic for everything ever"" feel. I don't know why they didn't do this a decade ago. Or half a decade ago, for that matter.

I get the impression that if you want the crazy gonzo shit that 4E turned D&amp;D into, you can still do that, but it's no longer the default assumption.

I also get the feeling that i can add or take away as I see fit to the ruleset without having to worry too much about random, hidden knock-on effects that rear their head days or weeks down the road.

I seriously feel like i could run this game again without having flashbacks to corporate tax return schedule 2011 T2 Sch1. I mean, I can go to work and get paid to crunch numbers. I want to game to relax and have fun.

I would be pretty happy to play this game in it's current playtest incarnation. It's not perfect yet, but I like it far better than any incarnation of D&amp;D to date.

 So long as the developers don't suddenly decide to so some weird, random thing to appease people who demand their game be crunchier than a dried out granola bar, I believe that this edition is going to be super sweet.

1. Stay engaged no matter what, you are pretending to be someone else and just because you wouldn't find something interesting doesn't mean your character wouldn't. Make sure you interact with your fellow party members, talk to npcs, and make note of all the little things your character would actually be doing. As an example don't just say you set up camp, actually go through the motions involved in doing so you don't have to do it every time but try it at least once for the experience.

2. Take a psych test in character, not the ones that are multiple choice but the moral and ethical question ones like ""You see a shop keeper being intimidated by the city guard?"" You will find thinking about these kind of scenarios in character outside of play sessions will help you react quicker and more in character when such moral quandaries show up in the game.

3. Give what your character says context don't just ""How are you today."" smile as you say it add an excited tone of voice reveal the kind of person your character is by showing us the kind of emotion they put behind their words.

4. The DM doesn't need to be there for you to role play, when the DM isn't around take the opportunity to talk in character. Share back story, discuss recent events, or better yet just try shooting the shit in character.

5. Remember it is and isn't a game. We play to have fun but at the same time you're not. The best role playing is done when for brief amount of time you become another person, who is really going through these experiences and you will start taking what happens very seriously because what happens matters a lot to the person you are trying to be.

Hopefully this helps you as much as it has helped me.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_1b3ym0,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1b3ym0/tips_for_better_role_playing/,

Firstly, they see a young man and his guard drake at the crossroads.  Being the headstrong adventurers they are, they attack and kill them both without talking to them at all.  Turns out the young man was trying to deliver a potion to his sick sister in the nearby foothills, with his dieing breath he begs them to bring it to her.  A misunderstanding led to them killing him, ok fine, that is just how it goes sometimes.  Fast-forward a couple encounters to the cottage where the sick little girl lives.  Turns out she has become a werewolf and accidentally killed off the rest of her family.  My PC's were getting their asses kicked so I decided that the sun was rising and she transforms back into a little girl.  She is crying, scared and wants her mother.  I basically tell them outright that the potion they have can cure her and there is two doses worth of the potion.  They decide to drink it themselves, just in case.  Ok, pragmatic move.  Then they intimidate the little girl to go into her home where her mother's eviscerated corpse is.  Next, they pass an athletics check to push a vegetable cart in front of the front door.  Then the Tiefling decides to sit up against the back door.  They proceed to light the house on fire and burn the little girl alive.  It takes a while so they hear her crying, then screaming and finally silence as the roof collapses.  I was upset and somewhat sickened by their decisions.  They kept passing the hard DC's I set for each task.  Short of metagaming them into the grave, what can I do to punish them?  This happened 5 days ago and I am still upset when I think about it.  My only thought so far is to have the girl survive by going into a cellar or something and coming after them later.  What do you think?

**TL;DR**  My PC's burned a little girl alive, they must be ~~punished~~ consequenced?

The rest of the lights in the town had long since burned out, yet this one crackled with life. They approached it, and three little lost Fire Mephits jumped out. (I basically described them as Tiny humanoid beings of pure fire.) My players spoke with them, got some story information and then did something I didn't expect. They asked to HELP them. So, the Mephits told them that they were scared and wanted to go home. So, my party got them in tow and took them to a massive furnace in the abandoned, destroyed city. When they got there, they discovered that it was roundabouts fifty (50) Fire mephits living there, which is why the furnace was still alive. The Mephits were so grateful, that they gave them an enchanted ring, which was tossed into the furnace, yet didn't melt. One of my characters asked if any of the Mephits wanted to travel with them. The ""runt"" of the group jumped out of the fire and said ""Me be light!"" So, my characters put him in a lantern shell and now have a ""Fire Mephit Lantern.""

I know you've all been incredibly anxious for the next parts of Stealing Immortality and have been wondering why I haven't been here for a week. That would be because my Christmas gift from the universe was a rather nasty hit of pneumonia, which brought me into the hospital when I started coughing up fair amounts of blood. I got sent into the ICU after complications arose and fluid started filling my lungs. I was pulled out of the ICU last night after the coughing blood stopped and the fluid stopped building up after being drained.

I'll be in observation for the next two days, and if the symptoms start to fade, they'll be sending me back home. I can't put an exact date on when you can expect the next parts, but it'll be finished, don't worry about that. I'd have written them here, but I was in far too much pain and too drugged up to know what was going on at all.

1362476358.0,105,self.DnD,19p6sd,ADHD halfling monk saves the day.,Rabbyk,130,25,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/19p6sd/adhd_halfling_monk_saves_the_day/,"I just finished one of the best games I've ever run. It took nearly four hours to clear out one room, but every minute of it was a cliffhanger. (tl;dr at bottom if you're not up to a long story.)

I'm running a party of five 2nd-level characters (3.5) plus one 2nd-level NPC cleric. Most of the players are relatively new to the game, so we've been moving kinda slowly. 

There's one character in particular that I need to flesh out for you before telling the story. He's a halfing monk with severe ADHD. The player has been roleplaying the character exceptionally well; he actually makes regular rolls to check what his attention-deficient response to any given situation is, often with near-disastrous results for the party (a mechanic that constantly keeps me on my toes, as I never know what will happen next). 

We've been making our way through one large underground complex for quite a while, largely because I'm placing them in big battles with large groups of weak/not too clever enemies to help them get used to the combat mechanics without facing too much danger. Things have also been slowed by significant periods of serious roleplay/diplomacy down there as well (not that that's a negative at all- they've gotten as much experience from that as from fighting).

So anyway, it seemed the time had come for something a bit more challenging, so I set that up for them tonight. Last week they had fought two big battles and were seriously depleted on HP and spells, so I had strongly encouraged them to head back and rest up in safety before continuing. They decided to go ahead and delve deeper into the dungeon instead. Knowing what was coming, I immediately feared for all their lives. 

We left off last time in a large room with a spiral staircase leading down a hole in the center of the floor. They went down (finding a disabled trap along the way) and found themselves in the middle of an enormous room- 40-ft high ceilings with luminescent fungi everywhere and a deep layer of rotting compost on the floor. There they met 4 twig blights and 4 skeletons skulking around and tending to the accumulated compost. For the sake of space, I'll just say that they dispatched the baddies (except for 2 turned skellies that disappeared through a door on the south wall) but took still more wounds in the process. The dwarven rogue immediately went to check the passageway the skeletons had escaped to while the rest of the party stayed near the bottom of the stairs. Most everybody was down to 1/4 health or less by this point and they were very much in need of a break.

Now there was a large cave mouth in the north wall which led to the residence of an absolute beast of a bugbear (heavily armored lvl 4 fighter/barbarian with excellent melee feats wielding a two-handed morningstar). The original idea was that he and his two well-trained (and HD-advanced) dire rats would come investigate the sounds of battle during the third round of combat in the main room. I rolled up on my decision tree that he happened to be asleep when the battle started, however (*phew*), and it took him some time to don his armor. The battle was over by the time he was ready to fight. I had the party make listen checks to hear him getting prepared, so they were aware something was up and were ready for trouble. 

Now they're standing in the middle of the room watching the cave mouth when this horrendous seven-foot tall creature decked in full battle regalia (stag horns for a hat, anybody?) comes barreling straight towards them at full speed, yelling and cursing in goblin, telling them to, ""Get ready for the stewpot!"" I mean to this party, dude was SERIOUSLY scary. They've hardly encountered anything bigger than a goblin before. I'm talking TPK in 6-7 rounds of melee if it operated at the peak of its abilities (and it was certainly smart enough to do precisely that).

The players debated for a bit (I always let them discuss strategy and tactics out of character, even in the middle of combat, because how else does anyone learn that stuff?); in an attempt to save their collective asses I let them make wisdom checks so I could not-so-subtly inform them that discretion would be the better part of valor in this particular situation. The barbarian went completely against her character's personality by deciding to listen to my advice and high-tail it out of there; most everyone else followed in a mass exodus up the stairway.

The little monk, however, faithfully rolled and failed his ADD check and thus decided the best idea head would be to rush full-speed towards the threat. He later told me he seriously feared for his life at that point, but had to play inside the bounds of his character's weakness (if only all players would operate that way... *sigh*). He fortunately realized his mistake before actually reaching the baddies and turned to run back toward the stairs- the rats caught up with him, but both missed their trip attacks and he slipped away cleanly. He started up the stairs and had the presence of mind to lay some caltrops (which he had cleverly decided to pick up earlier in the dungeon) behind him to slow any pursuit.

Both rats and the big guy missed their intelligence checks to not go barreling up a narrow stairway in pursuit of a large party; they also missed their spot checks for the caltrops, and all three wound up wounded as a result (slowing them to half speed, for those of you not familiar with the item). This gave the monk the chance to pull his sling and start taking pot shots as he retreated up the staircase (faster than the enemy could travel, given the whole ""metal spike in foot"" situation). He knocks one rat off the staircase to its death, and the other two finally make their percentile roll to give up the chase and head muttering and grumbling back towards the cave, glad to have chased the intruders away. (The monk can't see them at this point since he's retreated high enough that the stairs below him effectively block his view.)

The rest of the party, meanwhile, are busily retreating and yelling for the monk to come with, abandoning the rogue (remember him?) to his fate, hoping his hide skills were up to the task.

Now all this time said rogue had been silently slipping down the eastern wall to get in position for- *BAM!* ranged sneak attack right as the big baddie is dealing with the caltrops wedged between his toes. Significant damage from a bolt in the back. Mr. Big is too angry and hurt to find the source of this new irritation, however.

The monk can soon see the enemy heading back towards the cave, limping and grumbling about the ""stupid spikies"" that had dared to get in the way. The rest of the party is getting worried that no one has made it up the stairs yet, so they head back down to check on the situation. Metal armor + move silently down a staircase = not such a terrific idea. The bugbear, who's most of the way to his cave by now, of course notices the commotion and comes rushing back with a renewed rage. ""How dare they continue to harass me after I've chased them away,"" he thinks. He charges up the staircase at double speed (I judged that a spiral stair could approximate a straight line since he used his hand to anchor himself to the central pole, using it as an axis of rotation (yes, I know, but it was cool and the DM has discretion, right?)) The monk had fortunately moved to the outside of the staircase the previous round to take a shot at the rat still on the ground, so the bugbear just whizzed right past him on the way up. Attack of opportunity missed, but the monk is now standing behind his foe. At this point I have no idea how this whole thing will turn out. Biggie still has most his health, monk and rogue are trapped below him, and the rest of the party is totally unsure of whether to run or fight...

Then the monk comes up with an absolutely batshit crazy idea- he's going to try running up a staircase with no rails to jump on the bugbear's back while said creature is fully twice his size and has disrupted balance due to his injured feet. Mr. Halfling makes his balance check to run up, makes his tumble check to fling himself on the beastie's back (there are rings welded onto the armor that almost act as a ladder for him), and prepares to, well, I'm not sure exactly what. Problem is, his new mount fails its own balance check and begins to fall back down the stairs. Our super-duper halfling monk leaps off (with a grossly successful tumble check), but then lands too close to the edge of the stairs and teeters precariously over it. Nope. Balance check failed. He immediately tries to catch himself- reflex save made, but then the strength check to hang on just isn't quite good enough. Nearly thirty feet to the bottom, and only ten HP to spare. I give him a little credit for slowing his fall by grabbing out for the ledge, and he gets a further reduction to damage from the soft ground below. The dice fall in his favor and he pulls a total parkour move, smoothly rolling as he hits bottom- 3d6 falling damage, minus modifiers, and boom-only 3 total points of damage after falling most of the way from the ceiling. Now that's what I call a class act.

The bugbear, meanwhile, fails multiple checks to slow its fall and crashes all the way to the bottom of the stair (and right through all the caltrops, I might mention). It lands prone on the ground, injured from the fall, and as it shakily rises to its knees our sneaky rogue, who's been withholding his action the whole time, pops up with his readied sneak attack. His  javelin flies true and plants itself firmly in the monster's ear. The horrid creature slowly collapses into the dirt, its lifeblood quietly oozing out of its cracked skull. The other rat (who somehow failed multiple spot and intelligence checks to deal with the party or at least run away) was easily dispatched with a couple crisp ranged attacks as it wandered back to the cave.

Victory accomplished. *Cue halfling success kid.*

The mosquitoes were really getting to our group, so, being a storm sorcerer, I decided to make a little static field around myself to stun the mosquitoes if they got too close (I didn't kill them due to roleplaying reasons). Our warforged battlemind, Smasher, also started to suck the mosquitoes into his stomach, which he uses as a storage compartment for things, to get them away from him, too. After the majority of them were gone, one of the PCs asked the DM if the mosquitoes had any diseases, and started to worry because our cleric, the only guy who had any experience healing, was taking a different route (he couldn't turn up two sessions in a row, so we made up a roleplaying reason).

I then pointed out that we had an entire swarm of mosquitoes inside of Smasher's stomach, which we could release if needed. Intrigued by this idea, the DM asked us to throw around ideas for what diseases these mosquitoes might have, then picked a few and told us to roll d%s to determine what percentage of the mosquitoes had those diseases. We ended up with 66% of them having Dengue fever, and 71%, 36%, and some other percentage for, in no particular order, malaria, Oshun fever (our in game equivalent of Ross River fever, named for being common in the mosquitoes around the Oshun sea (commonly misnamed as an ocean)), and hepatitis B. Later, when meeting what were effectively travelling hippies in this swamp, the DM joked that they were lepers sent away from the town because they had leprosy. I joked back that maybe the mosquitoes had picked up the leprosy from biting the lepers. The DM, to see where we'd go with this, took this seriously, and had me roll a d% to determine how many of the mozzies had leprosy. I rolled 100%.

So now we have a swarm of super diseased mosquitoes inside our warforged, which we will later breed to create what is effectively a biological weapon.

Another good thing to happen that session is that, after defeating a weird, Large frog with mushrooms growing on its back, we determined that four of these were magical mushrooms (no, not magic mushrooms. We asked too), which we found increased the size of the eater for the encounter (Tiny or Small go to Medium, Medium goes to Large, then it takes 1 more than the last time to go up each size category afterwards (2 from Large to Huge, etc.)).

They were about halfway home when they passed a cop parked on the side of the road. The cop pulled out and followed them for roughly ten minutes before pulling them over. On top of that, my DM kept driving for a bit to reach a nearby gas station and pull over there, instead of on the dark road.

The troll flesh starts slowly creeping up his arm and around his body. The players are divided in what to think about this. The rogue lights his crossbow bolt on fire and shoots it at him.

**TL;DR- r/DnD is making a level 5, 4E dungeon together!**

Okay guys- time for a game. We're building a dungeon. The way it will work is that each person will describe/design a room or area in the dungeon. We must go in order and rooms must be numbered 1-15 (we'll start with just 15 areas for simplicity). I want to make it a level 5, 4E dungeon and if this catches on we'll do other editions and other levels.
Remember, each room will not be a combat encounter. Traps, empty rooms, puzzles, and fun NPC interactions are all viable.
Here's the example:

But since they're new and not sure about combat rules just yet, I've been allowing them to do certain things without rolling if they RP well enough.  Here's an example.

Before the adventure really got going, there was a list of townspeople for the party to talk to in town.  One of them was a magical scholar who was also kind of a prick.  So Bartholamew the rogue (yes that's how his name is spelled) decided to break into his tower and see what there was to steal.  While the rest of the party (a cleric and a paladin) hung out on the ground, he was ransacking the wizard's rooms for gold.  I wanted to make things more interesting, so I said that he saw the wizard coming back home.  With only seconds before he was discovered, the rogue rustled through his character sheets for a few minutes, then said ""I light his curtains on fire with my flint and steel.""

He managed to escape without being noticed, so now every time the party goes back into town, they get to see how Bartholamew ruined the wizard's life by torching his bedroom.  I'm going to make up some stupid roundabout ways for that to work- the wizard's tax forms were in there, his cat familiar has developed asthma, a damaged scroll from his bookcase misfired in his pocket and now his leg is a block of ice, and so on.

I'm sure there are a lot of other moments, but one recent one for me was in a 4e campaign and I was playing a cindersoul Genasi with pretty high fire resistance (about 15). Our party was in a very special forest. We found out (while in the middle of the forest) that every X hours the gases created by the trees will ignite and a flash fire will sweep through the forest. Some things happen and our entire party is trying to escape from the oncoming flashfire. 2 of our partymembers manage to hide inside a hollowed out tree. One just gets kind of fucked because he couldn't hide and was a purely martial character with no abilities to negate the damage. I was unable to hide but I decide to take the fire head on. As it hits me I activate my ""Firedeath"" racial ability that turns all the damage rolls against me to results of 1. It's a few dice rolls but my 15 fire resistance covers that as well. So I effectively take no damage from the giant firewave. However my DM decides that such a racial ability only applies to my person and therefore everything that isn't highly resistant to fire (such as metals) is melted. So he destroys the bulk of my equipment as well as making the leather armour I was wearing fuse with my skin (which makes no sense at all since that would require my skin to be affected by the fire).

We had just entered this elven city with towering cyclops guardians surrounding it (around 100 ft tall). 

I met the princess of this elven city at a bar. My character has a charisma of 2 (I rolled poorly and Mongrelfolk have horrible penalties to it, and I thought it would give good flavour). After scaring off the princess, I shift into a rat (+19 to stealth) and sneak into her bag as she's walking away. She takes me to her room, enters something into her magical journal that reads her thoughts, then leaves the room. I sneak up to the doorway and notice two guards outside. I cast flare down the hall to distract them and close the door. I ransack her room and steal two magical items (her diary and a pendant).

By now, the guards have caught on and are attempting to break down the magically locked door. Turn into a pigeon and fly out the window. Flawless thievery run. I return to the party.

As I was gone, our ranger tried to make a magical egg hatch by planting it in the ground (which is what his dreams told him). They dug it up and it was now a crystal that had crown to a height of 150ft and is sticking into the sky. Our wizard binds an air elemental to it and it begins to fly upward so I quickly go bird and put a bag of holding over it from the top. 

Our wizard reveals that the pendant I stole is meant to stop transformation into demonic forms. We get attacked by a demonic figure resembling a rhinoceros with 6 legs. It has pink fabric stretched over its back. We knock it unconscious with nonlethal damage and it turns back into the princess (who is now wounded and naked). We attempt to nurse her back to health in our tent overnight (after putting the pendant on her). We awake in the middle of the night with our tent surrounded by 300 elves and a cyclops leaning over our tent ready to smash us. We give them the princess, but the soldiers still nock arrows.

Pull the crystal out of the bag of holding. We all grab onto the top of it. We shoot through the roof of the tent and the eye of the cyclops into his skull. We are now inside a cyclops skull impaled on a giant purple crystal flying upward toward space. The elves try to fire arrows at us but the skull protects us. We take too long to cut our way out so we get to the edge of space and everyone starts to suffocate except for me (DM let me take Deep Breath as an invocation). Put them in a magical cabinet that sustains life that is in our bag of holding. Put crystal into bag of holding. Start plummeting to earth as a pigeon holding a bag of holding. I have a resist 6 fire aura. Stops me from burning up on entry. Roll well to navigate and fall less than a kilometer away from destination into a lake. Take 12d10 fall damage.

I kicked Z out of my house this morning, so my train of thought is back on track and I can write without having tortilla chips tossed at my head! Z's kind of a dick like that sometimes.

Anyway, when we last left off we had climbed the most prominent mountain on the first level of Pandemonium, searching for the Gods Loki and Auril! About halfway up the mountain, Loki had appeared before us and told us to get the hell off of his mountain! Naturally we told him to shove it, which caused, in Z's words, ""A massive HF-spitting Sephiroth bug"" to break through the mountain. Would Steve's utterance of the possibility of a Jenova bug completely screw us over?

Initiative was rolled, and for the first time in a while, most of us rolled like shit, with Heidi managing to move before everyone else before the Sephiroth bug made its assault.

Heidi: ""So what do we do with this thing? We don't have much room to maneuver. We're on a tiny outcropping.""

Steve: ""I don't know, man. Get somewhere out of its reach and start tossing buffs around or something.""

Chainsaw: ""That's probably the most sensible idea until we figure out whether or not we can even get through its chitin.""

Z: ""What are its feet like?""

Chris: ""They're like stilettos. Just sharp, pointed stumpy things.""

Z: ""Alright, so pushing it is probably out, and it's most likely immune to cold. Fantastic.""

Steve: ""Why not thunderfuck it or something?""

Z: ""If I know Chris as much as I like to think I do, then he's been keeping notes on our tactical madness and has several contingencies with this thing. We might have to actually fight it.""

Jay: ""Woah. The evil mastermind's stumped?""

Z: ""I'm not stumped, it's just likely that Chris is prepared for the madness for once. We've taken out two of his fancy Gods without really trying so far.""

Jay: ""Fair enough.""

And so the fight began. Buffs were placed, Heidi found a spot out of the Sephiroth bug's reach, and then the bug began its reign of terror. Its first course of action was to vomit HF (Hydroflouric acid to the non-chemistry minded) all over the playing field, placing a countdown on how long the platform would hold. Chris had it go straight for Z, and managed to hit him for quite a bit and give him a hell of a poison.

Z: ""Hmph. Only took you the better part of two sessions to get some damage in. God liver engage!""

Chris: ""Nope. This creature is accustomed to clashing with higher beings, and its poison cannot be normally processed by any means.""

Z: ""This dance of ours will end one day. What does it do?""

Chris: ""The poison is unique in the sense that it does not cause any damage, but saps away magical and divine abilities, severely weakening Gods and the like.""

Eyes widened to the size of saucers. We all looked at each other with an, ""oh shit"" written on our faces.

Steve: ""Most of us are Divine. Chainsaw, me, Z, and Heidi. Your time to shine, boy wonder.""

Z: ""Why must I always think of everything? ...Hide me somewhere and petrify me. The poison won't survive if I'm made of rock. Then remove the petrification. No more poison. But keep that thing away from me. It still spits the most powerful acid known to man.""

Steve: ""Atta boy. I'll petrify him. Heidi, unstone him. It's all you guys until we're back in the fight.""

""Hard"" does not even begin to describe the difficulty of this fight. The beast had a massive AC. Spells bounced right off of it. It could act more than once in a turn. However, the dice were against Chris and we had gotten fairly large AC buffs, but all in all, nobody was winning.

Chris: ""As the battle rages on in favor of no particular side, the ice beneath you begins to crack and give way. The acid has melted through in some areas, weakening the ice severely. You have about two rounds before it breaks.""

For the first time in a while, everyone was fairly stressed. Nobody knew how to deal with this thing. It was almost as invincible as we were. Jay, Steve, and Z were looking at each other, eyes darting back and forth at one another. It was like they were having some kind of conversation with just their eyes.

Chris: ""The level of silence over there is unnerving. What are you bastards up to?""

They completely ignored him and continued doing this for a few more minutes. They nodded and turned back to the rest of the group.

Steve: ""We're gonna call out the bug on being Loki. I don't know why we didn't think of this before. God of trickery, illusions, and shapeshifting? Come, now.""

Z: ""It would take eons of evolution for this thing to be able to stand up to a God. Everything else that wasn't a God that we've fought here dropped like a fly. As far as we see it, there can't be any other explanation. And with being the God of illusions...""

Jay: ""We guarantee you he's secretly been taking a pounding underneath that thing. I believe perception or insight would be the right thing to use.""

Chris kept his cool and let them roll. You can't just detect the God of trickery like that, can you? Evidently you could, because all three of them rolled natural 20s. They looked up at him with massive, shit-eating grins.

Chris: ""I really didn't think you'd think of that... well done. You look hard at the Sephiroth bug and determine that it is, indeed, Loki shrouded by an illusion so strong that it's actually caused you damage. You can see that he has sustained quite a few blows beneath it.""

Z: ""I fucking knew it. We were rolling against Loki and you were saving against the damage to keep the illusion going and looking unharmed. You clever bastard, you.""

They spread the news to the rest of the group, and we started striking right through the shade, alarming Loki and causing him to fall flat on his ass. As evidenced by many a movie, he's not exactly the toughest God, so we beat him heavily until he was unable to move. It was a bit like the Avengers when the Hulk slammed him on the ground repeatedly.

Z: ""All you, Jay. Stomp his face in.""

And so Jay curb stomped the God of trickery, crushing his skull beneath his boot. He tossed him right over the edge of the mountain, and soaked up his powers. But before we could consider what we did next, Chris interrupted.

Chris: ""Very well done. But if you know the Norse legends of Loki, you'd know that he was chained beneath a serpent dripping acidic venom over his head and back. The acid was quite real. The ice finally splits beneath you and begins to slide down the side of the mountain, and you start to free fall along with it.""

Chainsaw: ""Well, shit. That's no fun. Now what?""

Heidi: ""Fly?""

Chris: ""Certainly doable, yes,""

Heidi: ""Then we shall Fly!""

And so we flew up, up, and away, towards the mountain's summit.

Chris: ""As you accelerate towards the summit, the air becomes incredibly cold and thin, forcing you to stop and land. A large cloud of freezing white air begins to drift towards you, eventually surrounding you and forcing the mortals among you into a cryosleep-like state. The Gods are able to resist and you all watch as the cloud begins to take the shape of a beautiful woman, who begins to walk towards you. A devilish smirk makes its way across her face as she arms herself with equipment of ice, preparing for the inevitable battle...""

So I set up a cool adventure for them as a parting gift, complete with a skill challenge: one way or another, they had to get past some guards.  I figured they'd either sneak by, or they'd just charge in swinging.


Two of the party (a rogue and a seeker) easily slipped past the guards.  Somehow, the huge paladin just barely managed to evade the guards as well.  Then the cleric abysmally failed her stealth check, and  got caught by one of the guards.  I assumed they would just fight their way out of it.

Here's basically how the encounter went.

&gt;DM: ""Okay, the guard hears something moving and starts coming over to investigate.  He's looking right at you.  What do you do?""
&gt;
&gt;Cleric: ""... Can I put him in my bag of holding?""
&gt;
&gt;DM: ""Wait, what?""

After looking up exactly how much weight the bag of holding could fit, I determined that she could indeed fit a person in it.  The paladin snuck up, grabbed the guard, and the cleric shoved the bag over his head.  They then proceeded to retreat back to the forest, shake him around a bunch, and intimidate him into drawing off the other guards.

So that's the story of the time my party stuffed a person into a bag of holding.

And it's nice to be out of the hospital. Z told me that he kept you all updated and about all of your well wishes, which I would like to thank you all for. It's hard to describe what exactly was wrong with me, and it would probably take up half of this post. So we'll just skip that and say that I'm medicated and feeling better now. Updates won't be as frequent as they were before, since classes have started and part of getting over this is limiting my interaction with electronics and the like. So, with that, let's get this show on the road.

If memory serves, when we last left off we had finished off Loki and Auril has shown herself. Jay had stolen Loki's Godhood, and we were actually rather beaten up from the fight with him.

Z: ""Well that's dildos. Not even five minutes after we drop the last bastard, Shiva comes along. Fantastic.""

Steve: ""Shiva?""

Z: ""You know, the only summon in Final Fantasy that was worth a shit besides Bahamut. Or Yojimbo and Anima from X.""

Steve: ""Ohhh, right. Ice babes. Gotcha.""

Z: ""Howsabout we try to reason with her? I mean, yeah, we killed one of the few people in this world that she tolerated, but maybe if I told her she was a beautiful woman and to meet me topside for dinner she'd leave us be for now.""

Jay: ""For some reason, I don't see that working. Like, ever. But it was a nice thought.""

Z: ""Thanks for the support. Galactic asshat.""

Heidi: ""Well, we might as well roll initiative and get this over with.""

We all rolled miserably. Auril got the first shot, and it was a hell of a hit. The non-Gods among us found ourselves saving vs. death against an attack that was just like Shiva's Diamond Dust.

Chris: ""A huge gust of frigid air bites right down to your bones. You can feel the bitter cold freezing what moisture there is in the air around you, forming ice crystals around your limbs. Those of you that saved trudge behind the nearest form of cover and avoid the gust. Those of you that didn't, Matt and Gandalf... you're both frozen solid. Auril snaps her fingers, and the both of you shatter into thousands of shards of ice. The wind sweeps away the shards, nullifying your ability to raise them during combat. I believe you're up, Z?""

Eyes widened and jaws dropped. In one turn, Auril had killed two of us, including our super powerful wizard friend. The surviving members all looked at each other with the most exasperated expression I'd ever seen on their faces. Heads fell into hands, onto the table, and flopped over the backs of chairs.

Chainsaw: ""Well, fuck. Hopefully she can't do that shit again. And naturally nobody can do any kind of appropriate knowledge check to see if she'll be able to or not, can they?""

Z: ""Even if we did, this place is kinda niche, innit? Checks'd be absurd. I vote we just beat her to a bloody pulp as quickly as possible.""

Chainsaw: ""I agree. Anyone have any clever ideas?""

Jay: ""Can we create an A/M field?""

Steve: ""No, that would negate our magic, too. And we've been using that a lot. She could probably drop blocks of ice on our heads as a ranged basic or something, too.""

Z: ""You straight-up copied Shiva from X, didn't you? Good God, Chris. It's like you apply stuff from any game I play to your own. I dread the day we have to fight Anima.""

Steve: ""Don't jinx it. He'd probably have it shooting death lasers everywhere, since, you know, Anima.""

Jay: ""As long as it isn't Yojimbo... Fucking Zanmato.""

Chris: ""How about we stop discussing my blatant plagiarism here and you guys make your moves?""

Heidi: ""Yeah. Bright ideas, anyone?""

Z: ""What if we summoned a waterfall of magma or something? Then we could Sparta kick her into it. Then again, that would instantly melt the ice of this place, wouldn't it?""

Chainsaw: ""Most likely, yes. But it might be worth a try.""

Steve: ""We could soak her in oil and light that.""

Jay: ""She's the queen of ice or something like that. She could probably freeze the fire or something ludicrous like that.""

Z: ""Alright, let's just leave it at needing to kick her into the fires of Mordor if we wanted to kill her in one shot.""

Jay: ""Fair enough.""

Z: ""... Could we possibly teleport to one of the fiery Nine Hells and bring her with us? Toss her into a lake of magma or something. Close enough to the fires of Mount Doom.""

This idea was quickly agreed upon. They would create a portal, use a push spell to get her through it, and then hop through and fight her on fiery terrain.

Chris: ""Not so fast. Even if you're a God, you'll need prep time for creating a portal.""

Jay: ""You guys distract her, I'll go make a portal around the corner.""

Steve: ""Of course you'd run off, you goddamn French bastard.""

Z: ""Candy-ass.""

Jay: ""Logically speaking you guys *are* a lot more well-suited to distract her.""

Z: ""Oh yeah, we know that. It's just that you immediately decided that you'd be the one to make the portal and get out of the fray. Your French ancestry doesn't help.""

More fun was poked at Jay before we finally let him run off and make the portal. And then the fighting began. And the group got absolutely slammed. More frigid winds were blown, but most of the time they just took a fair amount of damage. They started actually losing, to the point where Z was dealing with a broken leg and nearly in the negatives.

Z: ""Shit, Jay. Hurry it up!""

Jay: ""Is the portal done yet?""

Chris: ""It's been about five rounds... yeah, it's good and stable.""

Z: ""PRAISE CTHULHU! I'll drop one of those awesome heals on myself, call her a galactic whore or something, and then run around the corner and try to get her to follow me.""

Luckily for us, she fell right for Z's ass-slapping ""come and get some you filthy whore"" taunt. He bolted around the corner and stuck to the side of the mountain. Auril followed him around, lost track of him, and then Steve and Chainsaw teamed up for a doubly powerful push spell.

Jay: ""You know, that whole taunt made you sound like you were a porn actor. 'GET SOME YOU FILTHY WHORE' sounds like it should be accompanied by a good dicking.""

Z: ""Jay, you are a sick, sick man. The fact that you came up with that within seconds of my saying it really makes me question where your mind is. Right now I wouldn't be surprised if it was some kind of bestiality, you freak.""

Jay: ""I've seen some shit...""

Chainsaw: ""Aaaaand that's more than enough of that. Hop through, children. There's work to be done.""

The group jumped through the portal into an incredibly unbearably hot environment where they were immediately making saves against heat strokes.

Steve: ""Christ, man. Can I drop resist elements on the party?""

Chris: ""Naturally. Due to the extreme heat, though, it feels like a hot summer day instead of like standing next to a bonfire.""

Z: ""Good, fine, great. Where's Shiva?""

Chris: ""Practically melting about three squares away.""

Heidi: ""Is there a nearby lake of fire or something to that effect?""

Chris: ""About 50 feet away you can see the lip of a volcano.""

Heidi: ""I wanna cast Dimension Door or something like it to create a link between our current position and a spot over the volcano to drop her into.""

Chris: ""That's fine, go right ahead.""

The rolls were made, locations for the doors were drawn, and now all that needed to be done was a shove through it.

Z: ""I got this. I'm going to kick her in the cooch and send her flying through like that.""

Chris: ""Roll a strength and a dex check.

A solid 19 and miserable 5.

Z: ""What was the dex for?""

Chris: ""You kick Auril in the vagina with the force of, well, an angry God. She staggers backwards towards the portal, but grabs onto your foot as she does. You find yourself falling down into the mouth of Mount Doom along with her.""

Z's eyes got really wide and he leaned back with an expression that's incredibly difficult to describe. As far as I was aware, this was one of the first times he was facing a potentially unavoidable death. 

Would he be able to pull off some kind of clever thought in a handful of seconds to save his skin? Will the much-loved asshole burn to a crisp in the magma of the mountain? Find out in the next part!

So this is the backstory he came up with. I like it and I want to work with it, but I need some ideas.   

&gt;A man who got sucked into a washing machine while looking for change. Was magically transported to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world. Along the way, his iPhone is inhabited by a spirit of intelligence who takes the place of Siri. Learns how to fight via YouTube videos and kung-fu movies from Netflix."" 
  

He's playing a level 1 human Rogue. He put +2 skill points into the following, I believe as him sort of representing the idea that he can just look stuff up on the fly:  
* Knowledge (Architecture) +2  
* Knowledge (Dungeoneer) +2  
* Knowledge (Geography) +2  
* Knowledge (Nature) +2  

So far I'm thinking that I can let him do the following:  
1. Use the iPhone as a flashlight/torch.  
2. When making a Knowledge check of any of the above skills, let him roll against a DC 5 to 20, depending on if he's deep inside a dungeon or cave and can't get reception. If he makes the save, he gets a +2 bonus to the check.  

Any more ideas or input would be greatly appreciated!  

**EDIT:** So as it stands, I'm still not sure which of the following I should go with:  
1. Legitimate internet access, and a solar charger. (Maybe the phone is able to connect to the towers on this alternate plain of reality?)  
2. No internet access, just tons of information backed up on PDF, movies saved on the phones memory and a bunch of apps.  
3. The phone doesn't work like a normal phone at all, it's actually an Intelligent Item that's been posessed by a highly intelligent spirit. This could lead to some fun banter if I decided to make the spirit kind of a dick.

Our group of five just entered this town and obviously wanted to sell off some gear and buy and potions (nothing out of the ordinary). However, my Bard was broke, like, broke broke.

 I had recently lost my schimitar that doubled as the neck of my lute, so I couldn't even play for money. However, our Tiefling Warlock decided it would be a good idea if I sing a tune to the townspeople at the local tavern to earn their respect and some renown in the local area. Little did the warlock know that's not the type of bard i am, man. I play  lute, not sing epics! 

So they left to do their shopping or whatever and i was left in the tavern, nervous as a naked Gnome in a cannibal tribe (yeah, that nervous). Unable to think of an epic quickly enough, a few drunks in the tavern start mocking me. Saying things such as, ""what kind of bard can't even sing?!"" Needless to say, that got me mad. So what did I do? I started talking shit back. I said something along the lines of, ""what kind of man gets drunk in the middle of the day?"" 

Now this is where things start to get hairy. More words were exchanged and the crowd started to encroach, so  I  took a dagger to the drunk's jugular and threatened to kill him if anyone were to come any closer. I held the man there until the group came back, heh.

This was not part of the DM's storyline. But hey, there's nothing wrong with a 45 minute skill check challenge to determine whether or not we calmed the townspeople. Needless to say, I was not popular in that town.

TL;DR - Bard can't sing, takes a knife to a rowdy drunk's neck. Townspeople are pissed, skill check challenge determines whether the town mauls us to death or not.

1356361542.0,89,self.DnD,15dj60,Yesterday I Was A Badass For The First Time,Robot_Pariah,117,28,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/15dj60/yesterday_i_was_a_badass_for_the_first_time/,"So in my Pathfinder game the other day, I spoke the most bad-ass words I've ever said. It was my older brother's Evil Gestalt game. I was playing as August, the Warlock/Antipaladin of Hastur. Our team met at a festival that each of us planned to destroy for different reasons. Once there, we met when we all saw each other destroying various parts of the village. We quickly decided to ally with each other. When we were done, and the town was sufficiently destroyed, we decided that we were powerful enough to hunt down the Chalice of En, an ancient artifact that had the power to grant 10 wishes to whoever holds it, but not normal wishes, these wishes are strong enough that you could easily kill a God with them. Or all of the Gods. So as we set out, the International Paladin Order(IPO) sent a troop of soldiers after us. We quickly massacred them all, except for the captain, who was much more difficult to take down. When we finally brought him to his knees, we stabilized him, debating what to do with him before he died. August had yet to say a word, so far only nodding and shaking his head. Well, August turned to the rest of the party and said ""Let me talk to him."" They all agreed that it'd be interesting to let me handle it. Here's how the exchange went down:

I walked into the room. The Captain was strapped down to a table. I pulled up a chair, and sat down next to him. 
Me: ""Hello""

Captain: ""Get your vile ass away from me, scum.""

""Don't worry my friend, I'm not here to hurt you. I just need some things from you.""

""I'm not giving you anything you pale freak.""

I reached towards his neck and grabbed the necklace around his neck. It was the holy symbol of Bahamut.

""You worship bahamut? Are you a very pious man?""

""You're damn right I worship Bahamut! Every day I go to his temple in Bahalomen. Across half the damn continent! He's the god of JUSTICE! Not that you'd know what that is, you sleep-deprived sack of crap!""(August's worship of Hastur gives him permanent insomnia, he's never slept before, and he always has big dark circles around his eyes, making it painfully obvious that he needs to rest)

""Very good. Worship is a wonderful thing is it not? Well, I don't mean to bother you too long, but I'd just like something of yours, then we'll be on our way.""

""What the hell do you want?""

""Your Compass.""

""My— My what? I don't have any compass! You're crazy!""

""Do not play stupid my friend. Every officer in the IPO ranked Captain or higher has a Compass, a sphere that can point the way to any IPO temple, and can teleport to the closer ones.""

""How do you know about the Compasses!?""

August pulled out a necklace from beneath his armor. At the end of it was the Yellow Sign of Hastur.

""I'm a Private First Class in the International Paladin Order. Not by choice of course. No follower of an Elder God would willingly join an army. Its more like we're technically members. I was blessed to follow Hastur at birth by my father. If we weren't in the IPO, our whole damn country would be torn down.""

""You? A paladin? Bullshit! A paladin has honor and pride and justice! They wouldn't tie down their enemies and kill them like cowards. If you want the compass, then duel me like a real warrior. I'll break every bone in your body!""

August slapped him in the face.
""Ignorant fool. I am a paladin, and a truer one than you! A paladin is not somebody like you who prays to his God for strength and uses their divine right to back up their taunts and justify killing a man who offers generosity to them! A paladin is one who worships a God because he agrees with his beliefs and wants to carry them out in the world! Bahamut is the god of wisdom and justice! And I assure you my friend, it was not wise to incite my anger like this! Now, silence yourself and hand me the damned Compass, along with your ID, and anything else you hold dear within your possession, or I will read to you from the King In Yellow, the unholy play of Hastur that can make any mortal man go insane to the point of suicide! Do I make myself clear!?""

He laid down completely shocked. August untied the captain's hands. The man reached into his bag, and handed August a small magical sphere that tugged to the direction of the nearby church. He also gave him a scroll with an image of his face, and a wooden statue of a sheep.""

""This sheep means something to you?""

""My wife, she collects wooden statuettes. She had a full collection of these farm animals she adored. The only one that she didn't have was a sheep. I bought it from the man who made the originals. Why do you want stuff that's meaningful to me?""

""Oh, because I intend to find and murder your friends and family.""

He screamed at me for a few minutes.

""Are you finished yet?""

""You're a heartless bastard, do you know that?""

August looked at his ID momentarily.

""Seleyah. Is that your name?""

""Yes.""

""Seleyah, I'm going to do something generous. I'm going to let you kill yourself.""

""What?""

""You seem like a man of honor. If I killed you now, with no pride, I'd be taking your honor away. If you kill yourself, you would pass on with dignity. So I'm going to untie you, and let you kill yourself.""

August untied Seleyah.

""You would really do this? For me?""

""No. I'm lying. I just wanted to give you a little hope before I slaughtered you. Au revoir. Pour votre bien, je prie pour que nous ne retrouverons dans l'au-delà. Parce que je vais te tuer de la même manière une fois de plus. Je vais dire à votre femme vous dit bonjour, mon ami."" August then cut his chest open with a butcher's knife, stuck his hand inside, and fired off an Eldritch blast.

August walked out, and when the rest of the party asked him what happened, he simply handed them the compass and the rest of Seleyah's loot, and muttered something about washing his hands. And when Mataca went inside to see what I'd done, the only thing he saw was a mangled corpse, and blood sprayed on the wall, in the shape of the Yellow Sign of Hastur.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_15dj60,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/15dj60/yesterday_i_was_a_badass_for_the_first_time/,
1342250452.0,90,self.DnD,wjio3,[Resource Guide] Choosing an Edition,HighTechnocrat,100,10,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/wjio3/resource_guide_choosing_an_edition/,"This post will be linked in the sidebar for all to see, and will be heavily curated to remain relevant and optimized.

The following is a list of the different editions of D&amp;D, some key differences between them, pros, cons, etc.

Keep in mind that every aspect of an edition is secondary to the set-up of your individual DM, set of homebrew rules, and just general style of your playgroup. That being said, each edition offers very different bases for your group, and can shift the focus of the game. Also, keep in mind that, unless noted, these refer to the version of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&amp;D) and not basic D&amp;D.

**First Edition (1e)** - This edition of the game introduced many of the staples of the game that have entered popular conscience. If someone was playing D&amp;D in an early 80's sitcom, they were likely playing this version. This edition introduced the race/class system, the alignment system, and the system of releasing supplemental books to expand the ruleset.

*Pros*:

* Quite easy to houserule as few rules are interconnected.
* Combat is very simple compared to some later editions.
* Doesn't require miniatures, grids or maps to play.

*Cons*: 

* Pretty unforgiving in combat there's no shame in running as often as you fight.
* The non-combat skills system is nowhere near as polished as later editions.
* Not for people who can't make a ruling on the fly and keep it consistent as you won't have rules for everything.
* Attacking using a rather cumbersome matrix based on your level and the monsters level, which essentially requires that the attack tables be constantly open during combat

*Things that are just different*:

* Group initiative- all members of a side act together including PCs.
* SAVE VS. 'X' OR DIE &lt;--This is much more common isn't restricted to high level foes.
* THAC0: ""To Hit AC 0"". The targets AC is subtracted from your ""THAC0"" value, giving you the number you need to roll on the die in order to succeed. This is fairly similar to later Armor Class rules, but many people find it to add unneeded math.
* Experience from Gold - You get far more xp from loot than from killing stuff so you tend to have to find where the DMs hidden it rather than it popping out of the orc's skulls also means that engaging in combat is less of a priority.

**Second Editon (2e)** - This edition was produced as a way to consolidate all of the previous rules and supplements into a unified game. This edition mainstreamed out of combat skills, the infamous THAC0 system, and magical ""schools"" and ""spheres"" for spells.

*Pros*: 

* As 1e but...
* More polish on non-combat skills.
* Class kits allow for greater customisation.
* Easily back compatible 1e and 2e change very little fundamentally so you can take rules and items straight from one to the other with little consequence.

*Cons*:

* combat is still harsh and short very easy to die.

*Things that are just different*:

* See 1e
* Less combat centric
* Lower HP
* Life as an adventurer is often short
* XP for gold.

**Third Edition (3e)** - This version of D&amp;D introduces the famous d20 system, in which basically every action can be resolved with the roll of a twenty-sided die. In addition, the system for minis on a grid-system is standardized, with movement and combat now less subjective. Additionally, tons of character customization options were fleshed out, including easier multi-classing, prestige classes, and the feat system.

3rd edition is largely ignored compared to 3.5, as 3.5 was fixed a lot glaring flaws in the original 3.0 rules. All content published for 3.0 is largely compatible with 3.5 with only minor exceptions.

**Third Edition, Revised (3.5)** - A decidedly small update to the D&amp;D world, and largely interchangeable with basic 3e, this edition was meant mostly as housekeeping for D&amp;D. Most classes were slightly reworked for balance and standardization reasons (especially rangers, druids, monks, and barbarians), monsters were changed to allow greater customization, and spell-casting was unified.

**pros**:

* Highly customizable characters
* detailed skill system
* Huge variety of unique classes and races
* Spells allow for an incredible range of creativity
* Customizable magic weapons/armor/shields
* Huge library of ""prestige classes"": Classes which you can multiclass into after meeting pre-requisites

**cons**:

* Balance issues between spellcasting and non-spellcasting classes, especially at higher levels
* ""Save or suck"" spells; players/monsters frequently die due to a single poor roll
* ""5 round day"": Spellcasters quickly expend their highest level spells, and many parties rest after only one or two very brief encoutners
* game balance is very poor at high levels
* Numerous one-off combat rules which are difficult and slow to use (particularly Grapple, which many groups refuse to use because it slows down the game so much)
* ""Dead Levels"": Many classes have many levels at which they only receive a numerical increase to one or more stats

**Pathfinder (PF)** - Developed as an open-source revision to D&amp;D 3.5, Pathfinder's goals were to flesh out basic classes (encouraging single classing over multi-classing), make leveling more rewarding, increase the number of options players have in any given situation (increasing the numbers of spells, abilities, and feats for all classes), and provide more options to further differentiate characters.

*pros*:

* Published under the ""Open Gaming License"", so the rules are available for free on the [Pathfinder SRD](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/)
* Built on 3.5's strengths, and attempted to patch many of its weaknesses
* No more ""dead levels""; every class gets something cool at every level
* Single-class characters are unique and interesting
* Class ""Archetypes"" allow customization of classes with alternate class abilities without needing to take a prestige class
* Improved caster/non-caster Balance: Spellcasters are a bit more survivable at lower levels than in 3.5, but non-casters can keep up at high levels because non-casters have more options available
* ""Save or Suck"" spells slightly improved: spells which outright kill something with one roll are limited for very high levels
* Monters have flat XP values, similar to 4th edition, which makes writing encounters simple for the DM
* Backwards-compatible with a lot content from 3.5 with very little conversion
* The ""Pathfinder Beginner Box"" is an excellent introduction to both Pathfinder and the Dungeons and Dragons hobby as a whole.

*cons*:

* There are still ""Save or Suck"" spells

*Other Stuff*:

* You gain a hit point/skill rank for leveling in your favored class. This makes single-class characters much more viable, but it also discourages creative multiclassing. This isn't necessarily bad, and is more of a matter of taste.

**Fourth Edition (4e)** - A massive revamp of the ruleset which changed combat almost entirely. Every class was given ""powers"" rather than having a few specific ""spell-casting"" classes. The basic list of races was changed, to include Dragonborn and Tieflings, and splitting elves into three distinct races. The healing system is completely overhauled, introducing healing surges. Out of combat skills are de-emphasized, symbolically by removing alignments, and procedurally by simplifying the skill-system.

*Pros*:

* All characters are interesting and have many abilities; Fighters can do more than just Power Attack
* Very few, if any, ""dead levels""
* Currently supported by Wizards of the Coast
* Dungeons and Dragons Insider: For a monthly subscription, Wizards provides access to their Character Builder (which includes all up-to-date character options), the Rules Compendium (a searchable rules index), access to both Dungeon Magazine and Dragon Magazine, and the ~~Virtual Tabletop~~ (NOTE: Due to recent events, the virtual tabletop has been abandoned)
* No more ""active defenses"". Fortitude/Reflex/Will are static values like armor class. Spellcasters make attack rolls just like everyone else
* Many ways for DMs to ramp difficulty up or down, easy to make enemies to fit the party
* Characters are very well balanced; there are few strictly bad choices
* Writing encounters is very easy for the DM; much of the math from previous editions was vastly simplified
* ""Minions"" (monsters with 1 hp) make fights with lots of one-shot enemies fun and simple
* Very gentle learning curve, and very accessible to new players. The ""Red Box"" starter set is an excellent introduction to 4th edition and Dungeons and Dragons as a whole.

*Cons*:

* Many groups find it harder to RolePlay because the mechanics are so combat-focused
* Combat is highly tactical, and very difficult to manage without a combat grid and miniatures
* There are no mechanics for mundane crafting or performance

*Other Stuff*:

* Characters start fairly durable, especially compared to other editions
* Dragonborn are in the players handbook, allowing players to play dragon-esque characters very easily
* ""Skill Challenges"": A series of free-form skill tests working toward a common goal. Opinions on the usefulness/fun of skill challenges vary wildly.
* ""Healing Surges"" introduce a new, daily-renewable healing mechanic which removes the need for ""heal-bot"" clerics. Some find that the healing surge system is too forgiving compared to previous editions, but this is mostly a matter of personal taste.

**D&amp;D Next (Next, or 5e)** - Still under development, and not yet officially named, Next is being developed via public playtesting. The game thus far has de-emphasized the grid system (as 4e made the use of minis almost required), abandoned the skill system in favor of simple stat mods, and changing monster regeneration. There is currently no release date for D&amp;D Next.

I want all of you to meet Uhh.

He's a half-orc, just over 7 feet tall and nearly 300 pounds. But he thinks he's a halfling. His mother had a bit of an affair with an orc, but he was raised with a halfling family and never told of his origin. So, naturally, he became a rogue just like his ""father"". He thinks he is *awesome* at sneaking.

Oh, yeah...the reason he thinks this is because he has an intelligence of 5. Because of that score, the DM and I decided he can only speak limited Common (you may disagree on how this would actually work, but I thought it would be entertaining and the DM agreed). So I have a list of 10 words he knows, and I only use those words in game, until he learns a new one.

He's learned two words so far, and he thinks one of them is a party member's name. She was sad, so Uhh was hugging her to cheer her up (he's a big sweetheart). All he knew was that she was ""no happy"", so she tried to teach him the word ""sad"". It involved her pointing at her tears and frown and repeating ""sad"". I tried interpreting it as my character would, so now he thinks her name is Sad. And in a tavern, we heard a bard singing an angry song involving phrases like ""Fuck the king, fuck the kingdom, etc..."", so Uhh learned a new song. It involves the word ""fuck"" repeated in a sing-song voice.

He loves bright colors, so he's wearing essentially a jester's outfit. He loves jingling noises, so he keeps a certain amount of his gold just so he can shake his coin purse for the noise. And yes, he thinks he's really sneaky.

Anyway, this all led to my favorite D&amp;D conversation ever. In quick summary: we were in a tavern, it was lit on fire, we escaped. Uhh was the first party member to escape (the only one to just launch himself out of the second-story window...no one else wanted to try that for some reason). When he hit the ground, he saw two men getting on horses and riding away quickly. So he ran after them. I rolled Int checks each turn to see if he'd figure out that he couldn't catch them, and it only took about three turns before he gave up and turned around.

Two guards had been chasing him, for the same reason he was chasing the riders--it looked like he had been running away from the fire, and they found that suspicious. So it led to this wonderful exchange:

**Guard 1** (the first one to reach him): ""Who are you?""
 
**Uhh**: ""Uhh.""

**Guard 1**: ""No, what's your *name*?""

**Guard 2** (having caught up): ""Who or what is he...she...it?""

**Uhh**: (points to self) ""Uhh!"" (points to guard 1) ""You!""

**Party Member** (who chased after the guards when she saw the problem): ""His name is Uhh!""

**Guard 1**: ""You're fucking kidding me!""

**Uhh**: (hearing his newest word, starts singing) ""Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!""

**Guard 2**"" ""His name is Uhh? His *name* is...Uhh?!""

**Uhh**: ""I Uhh! You you!""

**Party Member**: ""Yes, his name is Uhh! I swear!""

**Guard 1**: ""Did his parents drop him on his head?""

**Uhh** (who thinks the guards are pretty stupid for not getting this): (points to self) ""Uhh..."" (to guards) ""You..."" (to party member) ""Sad...""

**Party member**: ""His name is Uhh!""

**Guard 1**: ""Dropped on his head. Definitely dropped on his head.""

**Guard 2:** (mimes drinking and signals the ""crazy"" sign)

**Guard 1**: ""Ok, so what were you doing out here?""

**Uhh**: (mimes getting on a horse and riding)

**Guard 2**: ""...Horsemen?""

**Uhh** (having learned a new word): ""Whores men! Whores men! Fuck whores!""

**Party Member**: ""YES HE MEANS HORSEMEN.""

Has anyone else had a character create a cult at level one?,BritishAgnostic,103,11,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/zk27e/so_has_anyone_else_had_a_character_create_a_cult/,"Okay, this is definately a weird one. I was helping my girlfriend learn the ropes of D&amp;D 3.5e via a solo dungeon. She rolled up a Human Druid, with an eagle familiar. As part of a long running joke in the rrest of the group, the eagle was Jiji, the Herald of Death (We once had an eagle who killed everything. F*cking everything). Once again, the eagle killed everything (Admittedly, it was just kobolds and bugs). 

When we came to the last foe, a goblin, instead ofk illing it, we decided to roleplay a little. It was revealed that the goblin, Hooknose, considered himself to be the owner of the ruins, and so demanded to eat Jiji as a tax for her character's trespassing. One intimidate roll later, and he's on the floor begging for forgiveness. Without missing a beat, she demands that he hand over the dungeon for use as a temple to Jiji, and he willing starts to worship the eagle. It has been agreed that, from here on out, that character will try to gain followers to Jiji everywhere she goes.

This was all at level 1, by the way. Praise Lord Jiji!

Edit: we even made a page for Jiji and his now canonical brother. Praise Great Opococo!
http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Opococo_and_Jiji_%283.5e_Deity%29

Edit2: So, next dungeon she managed to recruit fourmore goblinoids into the cult. The others she just left alive. This is officially the campaign with the fewest kills. Ever.

However, last session, I had a lot of fun running a modified version of the moon rat quest off of /r/loremasters in which a creepy tailor was turning his patrons into rats. I had a lot of fun illustrating the rats actions and trying to communicate what had happened, but my players were just not interested at all. They just killed the rats, and the tailor without bothering to look into anything. They really like combat and I try to have at least 2 combat encounters in a 3 hour session (we play 4e so that's usually over an hour of combat) but then out of combat they tend to get bored really fast and opt for the most confrontational or quickest option (in hopes of more combat I think) I dunno, designing 3 to 4 hours of combat doesn't appeal to me at all, and combat is only going to get harder for me to run as they level up. What should I do? Suck it up and do more combat or stick with the more balanced approach and risk them getting bored?


**Edit:** Thanks for all the replies guys, I read them all and they were really helpful. I think part of the problem is that I'm predisposed to think that combat encounters will be a slog, so I don't try to make them fun. However, I just thought of a few really cool combat encounters that should be fun for me to run and force the players to think outside the box a little bit.

1369965253.0,88,self.DnD,1fdm7z,Region Sheets and a Travel System... A few ideas from a new DM,tritanVp,95,7,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1fdm7z/region_sheets_and_a_travel_system_a_few_ideas/,"I am very new to D&amp;D, and I've only DM'ed a few sessions, so this idea might not be entirely new or original. But in all my research, I haven't seen something like this yet. So please forgive me if this isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff. I just had a few ""eureka"" moments after studying D&amp;D/Pathfinder like a madman for 2 weeks straight.

So anyways. I always hear ""treat your environments like it is a character itself, it makes the experience more believable!"" Well, I want to take this to the next level. I was inspired by a ""Town Character Sheet"" where every major town has its own ""Stats"", like Corruption, Crime, Economy, Law, Lore, and Society. And these stats effect the players' rolls when they want to craft items, or bribe an official, etc etc.. Cool, right?

Well, imagine this: Each major Region in your world has a ""Region Sheet"", with the different terrain and the effects the area has on the party. For example, lets say the Mountains of Madness region has a special effect mechanic where the players slowly lose sanity. While the party is travelling there, they will recieve this effect, *no matter where they go in the region.*

That brings me to the next subject: **Travel.** In all of the games I've seen, travel happens like this: ""Ok, well, we decide to go to ____ town."" and the DM responds ""After a long journey, you arrive at ____"". To me, this seems like its trivial. The players get no tangible feel for the region they are in. So I want to propose a travel system.

On the map area of your Region Sheet, the distances between places will be mapped out using simple ""Units"". Lets say the road between Burglandia and the Castle of Fryes is *4 units.* Now, the Region you are in is notorious for bandits, so the DC of the road is *17*.  One player will roll *4d20* (because the road is 4 ""units"" long), and he's safe if he rolls under 16... but if he hits 17+, the party is suddenly stopped on their way to the Castle by a roadblock of marauders. They can choose to fight and kill them, or to pay off the bandits for safe passage.

Or the players are in a region where law is enforced and trade is flourishing. These roads are prosperous, and if they roll a *18+* on one of them, they encounter a jolly merchant who sells them goods at reduced price!

Now, to me this isn't the same as normal random encounters. Because these ""random encounters"" are *directly* tied to the region they are in, and they make sense, so in theory it would really bring out the world to the players in a new way, and tie their experience to it in a way that directly effects them.

I would love to hear some ideas and thoughts about this, or just tell me how much of an idiot I am. Either way, it seemed cool to me at the time :)

**TLDR:** Regions of your world map, just like monsters, now have special abilities that effect the players. Travelling distance on roads in a region is now mapped out using simple ""units"" and players make dicerolls to trigger (or avoid) certain regional/road effects.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,1369967953.0,,,True,t3_1fdm7z,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1fdm7z/region_sheets_and_a_travel_system_a_few_ideas/,

Your party is sitting at a tavern and see a young bar maid walk outside. After some time they hear her scream and run outside to see what happened. They see her on the ground crying with her face dirty and her dress torn. When they ask her what happenes she manages to get out that someone attacked her.
      In reality she simply tripped, tore her dress, and was too embarassed to say so. Instead she tells a lie. From here lead your players on a wild goose chase to see what they will think up.

Also, my first Reddit post.

Today I finally got to play my first game of D&amp;D. A tabletop game store near where I live hosts a D&amp;D 4e Encounters session every Wednesday and I finally worked up the nerve to go and join it. Having never played before, I owned none of the books and didn't have a single d20 to my name. When I went to the store I bought some dice and introduced myself to the other players. One of them then helped me create an awesome Halfling Rogue. Due to the fact I joined part-way through the campaign, my character was bumped up to level 5. I took a large amount of mobility powers so I could focus on getting in and out in the blink of an eye. My first encounter with hostile forces was when we were charged by two trolls. We managed to down the first one and then moved on to the second. Unfortunately, we forgot that trolls can come back from being killed due to regeneration. We contemplated chopping off it's head after we had killed it a second time, but the DM had us roll a history check, from which we learned the perils of quartering a troll. We came up with a creative solution to the problem though, combining Wall of Leaves with a lit torch to create a bonfire, with which we roasted the troll corpses. Sadly, the trolls dropped no loot. Next we advanced on a walled town that had been plagued with troll attacks. We learned from their leader that a troll army was approaching. Two of my allies went to work building pitch-filled traps, another trained the small and weak city guards to be more effective in combat and another went and helped train priests. I was left with the dangerous task of scouting the enemy camp. I was lucky and rolled only high numbers, so I managed to explore the camp fully and learn all of their battle plans. Unfortunately, I rolled a 2 for my stealth check to return to the town and attracted the attention of the trolls. Fortunately, the only heard me and never saw me, so I was able to return to the town without being seen. Next session, we have to repel the invaders and save the town. I'm looking forward to it.

He's a half elf merchant obsessed with gold and profit that travels with his cart selling ""legally obtained"" magical items, ranging from useful to harmful, the trick being that they are all unique in some way. Some ideas I've already had are:

*The Membership Card*: a ring given to them for free if they purchase an item. The ring will summon the Smuggler to them once a month provided the person wearing it says the word ""I feel as if I am carrying too much gold"" and they are not in a dangerous situation.

*The Hand Cannon*: a glove with a piece of steel on the back of it. When worn and the user points his palm at an enemy and slaps the piece of steel the glove lets loose a large fireball, however failing the firing check may cause the glove to backfire on the user.

*Almost Sentient Rope*: A 10 feet piece of rope that is sentient half the time and able to move and do simple command. The other 50% of the time it is just a normal piece of rope.

*Bag of Nearly Useful Items*: A pouch that produced an item that would be useful in the current situation, except has a major flaw in it for 1d4 hours. For example if a source of light is needed the bag will produce a candle, but without a wick. An arrow retrieved from the bag will be missing an arrowhead. If the players try to sell the items they will disappear from their inventory when they go to hand it over.

I actually thought I hated D&amp;D for a long time until I found a proper DM. Here's a list of that first one's mistakes - 


*   He divvied up experience points based on who killed what, rather than party involvement. So if your role was a healer or support character, you were screwed and would never level up. 
*   This was further complicated by the fact that he started you at level one regardless of what level the rest of the party was. 
*   He would often railroad in the most obvious ways ever. For instance, not letting you roll something that should have been a listen, spot, AND reflex roll to see if you get out of the way in time. 
*   He did knowledge checks in reverse. He'd have you roll and then ask YOU ""What do you know about (the spell being cast, this monster's abilities, the local politicans, etc)?""  
*   He had a DMNPC that was ludicrously overpowered. It was a sorcerer that would basically part the seas for us every time we needed help. Oh you need a boat for 6 people? Here you go. You need to take this monster down 50 hp? I can do that. You need to store 2 tons of loot somewhere? I gotcha. 
*   There was also some serious crowding going on. There were six people at the table to begin with, plus his NPC, and if anyone ever joined us for even a session, he'd cling to the character they rolled up and not let them go. So each round in battle took more than 10 minutes.

Yes, I want my players to level up, but no, I hate trying to plan out a campaign taking into account variable amounts of experience. It's also terribly time consuming.

So I don't! Instead, I treat my campaign like a story, with chapters in it. In each chapter, the players are a given level, and when they finish that chapter, they level up. This lets me pace out the campaign nicely based on player level, and removes any problems with tracking of experience.

Furthermore, I give my chapters titles, allowing me to foreshadow events (For instance, Chapter 6: Old Friends). I'm currently playing 4e, and so I've split my chapters into 3 books of 10 each... one book for the Heroic tier, one for the paragon tier, and one for the epic tier.

Bob wants to a sword and he thinks it would be cool if that sword was on fire, cos fire = cool right!
So Bob goes to the store and the flaming sword costs a lot of money, so Bob thinks ""Aha! I am a magical fellow, I can make one myself""

~~Bob discovers that only masterwork weapons can be enchanted so he buys a masterwork +1 sword for a few hundred gold.~~

~~Now bob gets to work:~~

~~The sword is already +1 and the flaming enchantment is a +1, making the total +2.~~

~~increasing +1 to +2 costs 8000g~~

~~This means that to make the sword it will take 8 days (8000/1000) ~~
~~Bob will give up 320 XP (8000/25) ~~
~~and Bob will need to spend 4000g (8000/2) ~~
~~Since the spell Flame Blade requires no material components, bob does not need to spend any money on that.~~

Have I worked this out correctly? 

EDIT: let's try this again - 

Bob buys a +1 magic sword for 2315g, since there is a requirement for the sword to be +1 before it is enchanted.

The sword is already +1 and the flaming enchantment is a +1, making the total +2. 

increasing +1 to +2 costs 6000g

This means that to make the sword it will take 6 days (6000/1000)

I'm here to tell you how much fire damage to you take for jumping into the sun. 

This might also work for the Heart of the elemental plane of fire.

Earlier this semester I was reading about science and I thought to myself ""damn, the sun is really hot."" It's pretty damn hot. So hot in fact (6000 C on the surface, 15000000 C at the core) that I don't even know how to comprehend it. Oh wait, of course I do, just put it in DND terms! I don't know about you, but this is how I comprehend everything. Also, I figure I might use it for some depraved reason in the future.

So first we need to figure out how to correspond degrees of Celsius into d6 of fire damage. I found that Lava can be estimated somewhat fairly into 1000 C. Immersion in laval deals 20d6 fire damage, so I can say that for every 1000 C an object is, it should deal 20d6 of fire damage. Being ""Exposed"" to lava (just being near it) deals 2d6 points of fire damage a round, so can probably use something similar for mere ""exposure"" to a small amount of star matter.

The Sun's surface is 6000 degrees Celsius. So being immersed in the surface of the sun should deal 120d6 fire damage a round! Thankfully, if you opt to instead just stand near the sun, you'll only take 12d6 fire a round. It's almost assuredly deadly to anyone, but with a high enough level character and protection from fire / resist fire an epic level dude might be able to swim in the sun without immunity.

The core is a whole different matter. At 15,000,000 C the core deals 300,000 d6 of fire damage a round! Mere exposure will steal deal 30,000 d6 a round. You probably shouldn't try rolling that, it might take a while. 

Of course, any character or monster immune to fire is technically okay. However, if you attempted to also account for pressure damage and the effects of the radiation (at the core it wont even matter if you're immune to fire since all matter gets turned to plasma. A Red dragon would get his matter converted so he'd still die from that. However, you might argue that a Fire Elemental is fine and can maintain his identity.)


TL;DR:

Surface: 120d6 immersion, 12d6 exposure |
Core: 300000d6 immersion, 30000 exposure

We’re clearing a chapel of Vecna cultists, and each room is time locked essentially. We found the main hall that featured a lot of cultists. I made the wonderful decision to teleport to the centre of the room’s obelisk thinking I was awesome and going to avoid getting melee’d. I’d forgotten the second floor of the building, with the balcony that looks onto the main floor. I’d pretty much just appeared in front of 5 cultists, who all proceeded to feather me with crossbow bolts. I fall to the floor and drag my bleeding ass away.
Then as my three mates arrive, I begin stealth killing all of the cultists on the bottom floor, it takes ages, and all of my party are knocked unconscious as well. I then make my way to the balcony, I push one cultist over the edge of the rail and he dies as a puddle on the floor below. I set up the door downstairs to be rigged with a mage fire grenade, then fit a javelin through the bolt in the door below.
I hear a scream above as the grenade is set off, I then drink an insubstantial potion, and put another mage fire grenade through the barred door.
I move from pillar to pillar in the main chapel until I’ve directly beneath the last crossbowman, and then use my executioner’s noose ability to pull him off the balcony, bringing him  to his death in an instant.
Once again, I teleport upstairs, sneak behind the one guy sitting behind the door and give him a good shivving, before he kicks me back and locks the door. I crack open the door and he shoots me in the chest with a crossbow, finally knocking me unconscious.

So this character is a water orc barbarian (Rage +4) with a starting strength of 22 (18 +4 from water orc). He then takes a level of fighter (For bonus feat) and three levels of orc paragon (+2 str). He then goes into the war hulk prestige class (Miniatures handbook) which gives him a +2 strength on each of the ten levels of this PRC. He then goes into frenzied berserker (Frenzy +6 str. stacks with rage) from complete warrior. He then has a wizard cast wish for him five times for an additional +5 to strength. He wears a +6 belt of giants strength and has a clawed arm graft from book of vile darkness (?). He also puts all of his ability increases into str.

SO 22(base)+4(rage)+6(frenzy)+20(war hulk)+4(clawed arm)+5 (Wish)+5(ability increases)+6 (Belt)+2 (Enlarge person)+2(orc paragon)=76

This is grog. He can lift 942,080 pounds over his head. He can throw 313,344 pound boulders 25 feet. He can push or drag 4,710,400. He is a 17 foot tall orc that weights 1620 pounds. People call him a monster. 

EDIT: forgot to say that he had a permanent enlarge person spell cast on hum so that he could meet the requirements for the war hulk prestige class.

EDIT: It has been brought to my attention that the graft is a bad idea both because it is an inherent bonus (Will not stack with wish) and it will drive my character insane. So poor grog only has 72 strength when raging and frenzied.

Dwarven Arm Wrestling is a deadly sport where anything goes-- two dwarves lock hands, and the only rule is that the first dwarf whose hand touches the floor loses. Common moves include things like the ""Dwarven Handshake""-- smashing your opponent's hand with a throwing hammer, or breaking the table beneath the match.

Anyways, to the question-- does anyone have any clever names for Dwarven professional arm wrestlers or moves? The only one I have so far is ""The Divine Spark"", a dwarf who wrestles with the might of Moradin himself, known for his famed Godsmack.

Ultimately any edition of D&amp;D is a game of imagination.  I understand that there are rules and such, and that perhaps some editions may have rules more conducive to non-combat encounters compared to 4E.  But why do you need WotC to tell you how much time to spend talking to folks in a town vs. fighting goblin hordes?

The impression I'm under is that if you play 4E and wish it had more RP aspects, you should take it up with your DM, not WotC.  I DM 4E campaigns with my friends and all in all there's no shortage of meaningful time spent out of combat, because they *like* it that way, and I don't feel any urge to push them along to get to the next combat encounter.  I feel that it would be this way regardless of what edition we played, and that if they wanted to do nothing but combat, they would do nothing but combat, regardless of what rulebooks we use.

Can someone shed a little light on this for me?  I'm not trying to start any sort of edition war, believe me.  I just honestly don't understand what keeps people from playing 4E however the hell they feel like playing it.

EDIT:  I should clarify - *all* I'm talking about is *emphasis* on combat, nothing else.

Hobgoblins are probably one of the most commonly used monstrous humanoids in DnD, right alongside Orcs, Goblins, and Gnolls. However, between 3.x, Pathfinder, and 4e, Hobgoblins have never quite attained the feel that their description shoots for.

[Pathfinder's Bestiary entry](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/hobgoblin.html#_hobgoblin) describes Hobgoblins as ""militaristic and fecund"", meaning that their society is militaristic, and they reproduce quickly and live short lives. Their equipment in 3.x and Pathfinder is typically a longsword, a bow, and some armor. Their favored class in 3.5 is fighter.

But, for some reason, Hobgoblins get a +4 bonus to move silently in 3.x, and +4 to stealth in Pathfinder. *Why*? They have Darkvision, but their Environment is ""Warm Hills"" in 3.5, and their Environment is ""Temperate Hills"" in Pathfinder. Again, *why*? They receive +2 to Dexterity and +2 to Constitution in both 3.5 and Pathfinder (+1 level adjustment in 3.5, of course). Their items and flavor seems more indicative of a race which prefers melee combat, and Pathfinder's bestiary says ""a hobgoblin stands 5 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds."" On a human scale, that height/weight ratio is either fairly chubby or fairly muscular.

4th edition does a bit better, in my opinion. 4e deviates from Pathfinder's appearance, and hobgoblin height ranges from 6'1"" to 6'5"" (Monster Manual, page 278) and weight from 190–240 lb, making them a bit bigger than your average human. They receive +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, +2 to Athletics, and +2 to History. In addition, their racial power allows them to save against an ongoing effect. As a whole, they are a fairly durable race with a few odd points. Assuming that their lives aren't any longer than humans (probable, if there are adventurers around), their bonuses to History and Charisma seem a bit silly. Their society is rough and militaristic, and few Hobgoblins would ever live long enough to study History in any depth.

I made a group (essentially a terrorist group) known as The Children of The Moon. They follow a set of ideals established by the group's founder who was an elf woman named Gholfir, who is now (maybe?) long-dead. In my campaign she followed a goddess who opposed expansion of civilization and wished to preserve nature. Gholfir saw lycanthropy as the ultimate gift from this goddess and started the Children of the Moon to fight growing cities.

They do anything from harrassing a newly settled village to kidnapping the child of a large city's lord for ransom. Their cells are located in the wilderness and in cities, hiding amongst the locals.

Lycanthropes also work slightly different in my campaign. They shift freely between their forms and range from rats, wolves, bears, and vultures. The curse can be transmitted but only if you're bit on the night of a full moon. Silver inhibits the lycanthrope's ability to rapidly regenerate.

Another detail is that the same goddess that the Children follow also opposes abominations of nature. Though the Children see themselves as alpha-predators, other followers of the goddess see them as monsters, and as such a faction of hunters dedicated to the eradication of the Children has formed.

The Children operate in secrecy in my campaign. It helps them to maintain their cells within cities as well as hide from the hunters. The general populace doesn't know of the Children's existence. Only the hunters and lords of cities that have fought them for years know of them. The hunters and lords don't bring their existence to light because doing so would cause panic within the cities if the people knew terrorists live among them.


And that's how I made lycanthropes extra interesting. Just thought I'd share and get some feedback.

Edit: Forgot to mention. The Children use lycanthropes that they call Ferals. They're people that were given the curse but their minds couldn't handle it and they are trapped in their beastial forms.  They've lost their human side and only desire blood. The Children see them still as special since they've received the gift but treat them as lesser beings. They're kept in cages and only released when the Children wish to shed blood.


TL;DR: Werewolves are cool.

Our party consists of Tim the Enchanter (human sorcerer), Erevan (eladrin invoker), Minotavr (minotaur monk), Samiel (dragonborn runepriest), and myself; Garel (genasi swordmage)

During one of our last sessions in a temple of Baphomet, we found a room with an imprisoned Dire Boar being tormented by some hyenas and archers. We killed off the hyenas without issue and did a quick check on the boar to find it had some kind of significance. We decide to clear the room and deal with it afterwards. Everyone, that is, except for Tim. Instead, he decided he was going to try and befriend the boar by giving it some jerky that we'd found previously. Which it ate, but did not change it's demeanor. We'd been delving this temple for a while and were not in the best shape to begin with, so after some excellent rolls from our DM, the 4 of us in combat had begun to take quite a beating. I get KO'd as the last archer escapes and Samiel comes to my aid with only 1 failed death save. During this time, Tim has done nothing but fail rolls and checks with the boar, and defended his plan by saying ""But if we make friends with him, he can kill them for us!"" then decides that he's going to need to get closer to the boar, and uses a teleport ability to get into the cage. He has no way out. The boar goes nuts and attacks him, knocking him prone. The group hurries over to try and break the cage down to save him.  I get back to my feet (barely) with a single healing surge left. By the time I get to the cage it has been broken down and they have bloodied the boar, who has since knocked Tim out. By the time the boar was killed, Tim had failed 2 death saves and I was damn close to finishing him myself. (Which from an RP standpoint of playing Evil would have been fantastic now that I think about it) I decided against it in a meta thought because I didn't want to deal with his bitching.

So far it's been a big success and promotes players roleplaying because they're utilizing information that they've created and added to the game.  Here is the description:

**What is a “Truth”?**

Every single time you and your players get together and play roleplaying games they are discovering facts and realities about the fantastic world that their characters are adventuring in.  Every time they ask “What happens?” or “Where are we going?” they are discovering the very building blocks that make this world different from every other.  The idea behind Truths is that you are leaving gaps in the gaming world and putting the power of filling those gaps in the hands of your players.  By letting your players create those facts and Truths about the world they are now investing into that world with their own vision of what should be there.  As players progress through the story they are given opportunities to create more Truths for the world that immediately fill the world with wonder and intrigue.

**Starting a Game with Truths**

A good way to get players involved with a game world is when they are making their characters.  Discuss ideas with them about what kind of character they would like to play and once they have a solid idea ask them to think about two things from their background that either they learned or was taught by the people they grew up with.  An example of this would be if someone is making everyone’s favorite character, the Half-Orc Barbarian named Grog.  Grog’s player says that Grog grew up with human parents who struggled to keep Grog’s rage in check until the village they lived in was destroyed by a Dragon.  The DM asks him what Grog learned over the years until recently and Grog’s player says he learned that young Dragons like to terrorize Villages for fun and that Orc tribes are nomadic so he’s never met his true father.  Suddenly from one player alone the DM has two facts about the world that they can build story hooks from that shine a spotlight on the knowledge that player has.  

**Creating a World to Play In**

After players have created their characters and given the DM their first two Truths it should be pretty clear what kind of setting the players want to play in or what kinds of adventures they’d like to get involved in.  Building off of our example of Grog, the Half-Orc Barbarian, maybe the Dragon attacks are a serious problem and several important cities the players will visit will be in a state of constant high alert or a kind of Martial Law that would be a challenge for them when they try to do business in town.  Orc tribes are nomadic in this world?  Sounds like travel might be bit more dangerous than usual and small villages could be found ransacked and barren.  Using the answers from the players a world can be created that every member of the party holds a puzzle piece to.

**Gaining More Truths**

So you’ve got a group together and they’ve been adventuring in the world created using the Truths.  Now what?  Throughout their adventures each character will develop and learn new and interesting things about the world, whether it happens in-session or during the down time away from the table.  Every time a character gains a level they should be given the option to create one new Truth based on something they learned since the last time they gained a level.  If they haven’t really done a lot that they can make a new Truth they could just expand on an old truth.  So in Grog’s example he’s saved a village of farmers and fought off a band of Goblins which gains him enough experience to gain a level.  He decides that Grog got to chatting with some grateful farmers who told him that Goblins really love eating and riding stolen pigs.  So Grog’s player adds “Goblins favorite food and favored mount is a pig”.  Now the DM can use that as a theme or adventure hook clue for a future session.

**Truths as Secrets and Background for the “Big Bad”**

The players aren’t the only characters in the game that can benefit from Truths.  For a DM trying to figure out what to do next in the game and working off the Truths their players provided them when creating their characters they should create a number of Secrets affecting the world equal to the number of players.  In a four player game (Three players and a DM) the DM would create four Secrets with consequences that the players may not realize are related.   For example, perhaps the real reason that the Young Dragons have started attacking small villages is because the evil Black Dragon, Azeroc, a legendary Dragon from ages past, has awakened and prophesized that a hero with humble beginnings would find the Ark of Heroes and use its power to spell the Dragon’s doom.   The DM now has several secret Truths that would write as “The Ancient Dragon, Azeroc, has risen”, “A Prophecy calls for a hero to slay him”, and “The Ark of Heroes must be found to save the day”.  Having these secrets the DM can again make adventure hooks that reveal them to the players and lead them to a story resolution.

For our first stage, we entered a Japanese-style Shinto garden with three bridges crossing a river.  Each bridge held a different sub-boss, so to speak.  All of which were Japanese-esque warriors (e.g. samurai) and our assassin-type character decided he would uphold the honor code that existed in the Japanese warrior culture and duel each sub-boss one by one. He proceeded to yell “Honor!” repeatedly as he utilized his out-of-game fencing knowledge to slowly take down each sub-boss until the last one, where the Elven mage (Me) decided to simply summon a meteorite and crush him with haste.

Our second nation-themed stage was within a large cavern.  We entered a cage, which acted as an elevator and were brought up to the roof, stopping at each floor to defeat the sub-bosses.  **This is where Jacques enters.** On the second floor, we reached an apparently empty large room filled with furnaces and giant crates… of muffins.  Our DM turned on some French bistro music and began his introduction of Jacques the Muffin Man, speaking in an impeccable French accent.  After this rather hilarious and slightly racist speech, we attacked him.  Although we are a rather strong team, Jacques seemed to have a specific muffin for every attack we threw at him.  Fire ball? Blueberry muffin.  Physical attack? Stale muffin.  And when we managed to corner him, he would use powdered sugar to teleport away. “I am Jacques, you can never defeat me!”  We fought him for a good 10 minutes when one of our group members had an idea.  “We need to make a swastika.” After a small moment of confusion and a long period of laughter, we decided to try it.  So, being the mage, I conjured some flames in my hands and began to burn a large swastika into the cavern wall behind us.  When Jacques realized this, his face turned white; He wasn’t a mime, no: Our crazy plan had worked.  “Y-Y-You’re… NAZIS?!”  He then used his powdered sugar to teleport to an unknown location, presumably far away.  We have not sees any more of Jacques, but our DM made it a point to say the muffin man would not be gone forever.  He even said that he is a close second in strength to the main villain of our campaign.

Maybe we can ally with Jacques. Free muffins.

1358812560.0,68,self.DnD,170rps,zombie encounter I came up with today that I thought I would share.,Psylynt,78,10,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/170rps/zombie_encounter_i_came_up_with_today_that_i/,"The group may have heard rumors from a town or village that strange occurrences have been witnessed at a graveyard nearby.  Upon investigation, the players come upon the graveyard and notice a shambling figure among the tombstones.

An easy DC check will alert the players that this figure is clearly a rotting tattered humanoid which is most assuredly an undead creature.  At this point, the players will most likely attempt to charge and or fire upon the creature.  Any damage or confrontation will illicit a verbal response from the zombie.  A surprised ""Oww!"" or friendly ""Hello"" will hopefully stop the players in their tracks, dumbfounded as to how a zombie can still retain his conversational faculties.  His name is Odif (Fido backwards, nerd movie reference xD)

After a bit of dialogue, the players will learn that this man is somehow resisting a full zombification process by some fantastical means.  He was exiled from his hometown long ago after succumbing to the Rott.  Since then, he has been guarding his dead wife's burial site from a band of graverobbing goblins.  Perhaps the man's love for his wife has staved off full zombification, or maybe it is an unknown magical trinket he wears.

This man is of course a magical oddity that some players might find lucrative.  Selling this creature or information about him to a magic arcanum might yield profitable results, but he will refuse to leave his wife's side in fear of her being disturbed by graverobbers.  The players might decide to help him alleviate his fear by ridding the area of the band of goblins.  After the eradication of the culprits, Odif might be convinced to follow (albeit slowly) and help the players or offer himself up for study.

In the future campaign I am planning, this encounter might very well be a pivotal encounter for overcoming the zombie apocalypse my players will endure.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_170rps,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/170rps/zombie_encounter_i_came_up_with_today_that_i/,

My paladin is a kick-ass defender but not mobile at all. (Chaladin with no strength, Athletics of 1 and Acrobatics of 2 at level 11).

The best I can do is sit at the bottom of the wall and challenge him while all the squishy-but-mobile party members mob him on the top. Eventually I run out of ranged attacks and find myself pretty useless. 

As you may know, paladins need to engage (move next to or attack) an enemy in order for their challenge to function. I try insulting him and the DM lets me roll intimidate vs will to keep the mark going, but that fails.

As a hospitaler with good Cha and Decent Wis, violating my mark means 12 radiant damage for the enemy the first time in the turn, and 8HP for every target he attacks every time he attacks. Since solos are serious multi-attackers, this meant something on the order of 50HP a round. I wanted that mark.

Eventually I realize we are standing in snow, so I pick up a snowball and chuck it at him. If you've ever seen a paladin make a ranged-basic attack before, you know it's a pitiful thing. I missed every single time, but I was able to keep my mark on him.

Eventually he transformed into a dragon and flew out of melee reach, leaving me with no way to mark. So of course I threw more snowballs.

One of the first that comes to mind was actually my first time playing.



My friend was a a broad sword wielding half-orc damage sponge. Meanwhile I was your standard run of the mill bow wielding Elven ranger. 


We are in a dungeon and go to open up this makeshift door and realize there is an entire village of kobolds on the other side of it. The first thing out of my friends mouth is ""Shut the fucking door"". 


Our DM decides to play along and has them all rush the door. So my friend in turn braces it... and rolls a natural 20. Ripping the door off it's hinges and crushing the 2 kobolds behind it. He then picks up the door and using it like a shield in the doorway. Entering him into a pushing match with the kobolds on the other side. 


So now its my job to shoot around him. Which I succeed in doing to the first few times. Then while trying to fire over his shoulder I rolled a Crit fail... Our DM looks at me a says ""roll to see if it hits"" to which I rolled a Crit... Effectively one hitting my best friend in the back of the head. 


My DM was merciful and let him live at the cost of an INT point (he suffered brain damage but lived)



**TL;DR I crit failed then crit hit and one shot my best friend.**




In the end it was moments like this where we were laughing hysterically at our bad luck that made me really enjoy playing this game.

Can always count on good old Z to spoil a cliffhanger like a medieval dickweed.

When we last left off, myself and Gandalf had been Diamond Dusted by Auril and shattered into thousands of pieces and swept away with the wind. The resulting fight was tough, and the group was beaten up pretty badly by the ice queen. They then decided to throw her through a portal to one of the fierier levels of the Abyss, where they planned on throwing Auril into a volcano or something. Z went to kick her in the cooch through a dimension door whose exit was over the mouth of a volcano and ended up being dragged down with her. Would our favorite asshat survive this encounter?

Yes. I think his idea was clever, but naturally he didn't like it because that's how he is.

Chris: ""Alright, I'm giving you a minute to figure out how to get out of this. If you don't figure something out, you and Auril will fall into the magma and burn to death.""

Z: ""Before the minute starts, I need a graphing calculator, a scale model of the volcano and where the dimension door's exit was in relation to it, and someone to sing 'Under Pressure' from the first chorus.""

Jay: ""Any other weird demands?""

Z: ""Yes. I need to know how gravity works on this plane. Same as our own, is it stronger, weaker, up to choice?""

Chris: ""Same as ours. I'll grab the stuff. Steve, you do Bowie. I'll be Mercury.""

The materials were obtained and the minute began. As soon as the pencil hit the paper, it didn't stop. His hands were practically blurs as he punched numbers into the calculator and wrote out equations on the paper that even Chainsaw, an engineer by trade, failed to understand. Drawings were made, curses were thrown about, and we all discovered that Chris has a beautiful dramatic baritone. Eventually, his 60 seconds ended and he slammed his pencil on the table.

Z: ""Well, according to my calculations the height we started from gives us an additional 22 seconds. It would take about 34 seconds to reach the side of the volcano by swimming through the air at half of my regular swim speed, but the heat of the rock and intense friction would tear my hands up. That awesome steel cable grappling hook would take too long to fish out of my bags, so that's a no-go. I imagine I can't cast fly or anything like it, making that pointless. On top of all of this, Auril is still attached to my ankle. So I'm gonna toss my bag full of bags of holding away and crawl into my portable hole with Auril. Kind of obvious and boring if you ask me.""

Chris had taken his paper during his explanation and was staring at it with a studious look on his face. A few seconds after Z finished explaining his plan, he passed the paper to Chainsaw.

Chris: ""I think I get the gist of all these calculations, but I can't make heads or tails of the equations themselves. Chainsaw, you're an engineer. Could you somehow make sense of this?""

Chainsaw: ""Sure. I love this kind of stuff.""

Jay: ""I don't know how you came to the conclusion that crawling into the IKEA warehouse sized portable hole was the logical and obvious thing to do. That's probably the last thing I'd think of.""

Heidi: ""Same here. I probably would have attempted to grab onto the sides of the volcano.""

Z: ""Yeah, well, that rock's red hot and all craggy and sharp. Ain't no way I was doing that. I'm not Luffy.""

Chris had him make a few checks and eventually he was in the hole, shrinking the entrance and blocking it with a slab of nevermelting ice we had found a while back. Now he was alone with Auril, who was rather upset with him.

Z: ""Right! I'm gonna run off and hide in one of our crates of stuff or something and work on comprehend languages. She should be some kind of incapacitated for a while. Seems reasonable to me.""

Chris: ""Fair enough. You sprint off while she's broken and in pain and work on setting up the ritual in one of your crates full of swag, as you call it. I'll let you speak and understand it so we can see what you'll do.""

Z: ""Nice. I'll jump out of the box and heal her.""

Everyone gave him one of those ""say whaaaat?"" looks while tilting their heads.""

Chris: ""I don't normally do this, but are you sure you wanna do that?""

Steve: ""Yeah, man. You could curb stomp her and end it.""

Z: ""Totally sure. While I do this I'll explain to her that trying to kill me is pointless since the only way out of here would entail swimming through magma. If we work together, we could find a way out and maybe go our separate ways.""

And so we listened as Z and Auril had one of the strangest conversations we'd heard after Z had fiddled with his phone for a bit. He tossed a d20 up in the air on occasion, something he does during talky moments. Eventually he stopped the conversation and leaned back in his chair with a confident smile.

Z: ""So, my dear, howsabout you join my friends and I? We're on a crusade to slay some other Gods, and if you joined us we could eliminate a few you have enmity with.""

Everyone looked dumbfounded as he made this request. Chris leaned forward in that way you would while trying to explain something to a child.

Chris: ""How do you plan on doing this?""

Z: ""Fantastic question, my dear Christopher. Surely you saw the tosses of the d20. But what you didn't see was how I set up my phone to record all of the results. I treated the whole thing as something like a diplomacy check, tossing it every minute or so while she listened. If you'll let it slide, I'd like to use the results as a chance for her to be charmed by my amazing charisma.""

Everyone's eyes grew to the size of saucers as they stared at him. Jaws dropped, heads tilted like a puppy's would, and looks of general confusion crossed faces.

Heidi: ""That's absolutely brilliant.""

Z: ""The fun part is that I don't know the results either. I kept my eyes on you the whole time. The way I see it, she'll either be infatuated, or she'll tear my head off at the notion. Let's see, shall we?""

He tossed the phone over to Chris, who had looks of surprise constantly crossing his face as he watched the d20 fall.

Chris: ""No roll was beneath 15, and you landed at least four natural 20s. I'm gonna rule that she wants the cock.""

Z: ""Fantastic. Now we just have to get out of here.""

Heidi: ""Once again, I am astounded. What did we see while this happened?""

Chris: ""You watched as Z and Auril tumbled down into the volcano. Eventually Z crawled into a hole and dragged Auril into it with him. The hole shrunk and eventually fell out of view.""

Heidi: ""Could I make some kind of telekinetic link with him?""

Chris: ""Well, he's in a pocket dimension, although he does have a tiny opening floating somewhere in the lava. Give me a good roll and I'll let you do it.""

An 18. With all of the modifiers added, it broke 35 or so.

Chris: ""I'll let you do it, yeah. Z, you hear Heidi's voice in your head as she says...""

Heidi: ""You're insane. I don't know how we're going to get you out of there. Any bright ideas?""

Z: ""My bright ideas bank has been drained. Anyone else have a clever thought?""

Steve: ""Could *we* cast fly and roll for a stronger resist elements to look for the hole? And couldn't Z open the hole a bit more to match the diameter of the block of ice so it'd be easier to see?""

Jay: ""How would we get the hole back up here? You can't really grab a hole.""

Chainsaw: ""Well, from the way I see it, it's just a hole. The hole itself is weightless, right? Theoretically, we could use a mage hand or something to grab it and bring it up. Also, I can't make heads or tails of these calculations. There's the speed of light, strength of normal gravity, something about weightlessness, another something about distance from magma to ignite... he'd have to explain it to me.""

Z: ""It's a mystery to everyone. Except me. I keep my secrets close to me. You'll never take me Lucky Charms!""

Chris: ""... Right. I suppose I could let you do it. Why don't you at least explain the distance from magma to ignite so they know how deep in they can go?""

Z: ""Well, I used the distance Anikin was from the river of lava in the only prequel I could tolerate as a control. Then I took into account how there's a possibility that this lava is hotter since we're in Hell. But for that to happen it'd have to be deep underground. Then I figured we'd be surrounded by the lava instead of being exposed to a fixed area. So I guessed the distance that Anikin was when he ignited as being about 3 meters, so if we were directly above a massive pool, I multiplied it by 10 and came up with 30 meters. Converted to standard that's about 30 yards or 90 feet, which should be more than enough to spot a hunk of colorless ice and a black hole floating in a pool of orange/red magma. At least I think so. Assuming we're going by 20/20 vision. But then again we might be able to augment our seeing distance with magic. Or use a telescope. That works too.""

Jaws dropped again. It made sense if you thought about it long enough. Chris let it slide, so they gently floated down and eventually spotted it. Mage Hand worked since the hole itself was theoretically weightless. Auril and Z hopped out of the hole, and suddenly we had an ice queen as an ally.

Z: ""I'd like to think that she could conjure an army of ice golems or something at will. Since, you know. Ice goddess. So we could go up against the next God with a massive advantage, I think.""

Chainsaw: ""We need to gett Matt and Gandalf back.""

Chris: ""That's gonna be the fun part. Their souls were ripped apart in the Diamond Dust, kind of like Gandalf's was the first time. Strong winds blew away the powdered ice. I let you bring Gandalf back since you had his body. But now you have nothing. They're quite dead this time.""

Heads were slammed against the table. I was dead forever, as was Gandalf. Auril had no way of tracking us. They could run around and try to resurrect snow all day, and they'd probably bring back something particularly nasty if they did that.

Chris: ""Remember how Gandalf said you'd have to take their places in their respective Pantheon? That time is coming. You can't run from it forever. What do you plan on doing?""

Vulgarities were tossed around the table as everyone wracked their brain for ideas. Nothing came out of anyone. Eventually, Z spoke up.

Z: ""Imma get some drank. Anyone want anything?""

Loads of alcohol was requested. Eventually he came back with more fruity drinks for himself and Heidi along with a repertoire of other drinks.

Steve: ""I got nothing.""

Chainsaw: ""Nope.""

Jay: ""Well, shit.""

Heidi: ""Me neither.""

Z smirked and chugged most of his drink. He slammed it on the table as he gave us all a shit eating grin.

Z: ""It's simple. We kill some good Gods and take *their* places. Gods can create life, right? So we'll just make some replacements and toss them our powers from the first ones we slew. Bam-ba-lam, motherfucker.""

... And that's where we'll leave off. Will they find a clever way to revive Gandalf and I? How will this plan pan out? Will Z ever run out of clever ideas?

I expected the game to quickly dissolve and for the ones who were interested to start a new smaller game and the rest to have at least gotten their feet wet... everyone stayed and the game lasted a year and a half.

The reason why can best be summed up in a story of when I tried to give them the classic ""mini dungeon"" an ancient Dwarven outpost full of dwarf undead that had been plaguing the countryside for generations. 

For reference I try to make an environment that allows the players to do what EVER they want and I just have the world react to them, they want to go around and feed needy children the town will love them but they probably wont have much work come their way, they go around raping bar maids and random women in the street, the guards will probably deball them with out a trial and leave them as an example for the rest of the world.

So they hear about the undead in a local INN upon over hearing some local folk lore. they ask around town and find a map to the old outpost back 1000 years ago when the dwarven empire used to reach this far before its decline so long ago, still in decline in fact.  

They head out I have the loot all planned out even a set of antique playing cards that the thief can use to get him in good with the local thieves guild.
The Paladin still new at being an attacker (was played by a girl who IRL was tiny and not used to being aggressive... later she became impossible to fucking land a blow on let alone get a monster that could survive the stupid amount of damage she pumped out).
She takes point, they heard me say monsters to the right treasure to the left (and I built the dungeon that way on purpose) so they went left and I draw a small room with a single skeleton in it. he is just sitting there animated waiting... and she stops. I am thinking about how magic would work and what it would do if it spotted her... nothing it was told to guard the room she isnt int it.
So then she says something that BLEW MY SOCKS OFF ""I give him a traditional Dwarven greeting"" 
she rolls diplomacy and gets a 17... I just sat there amazed. 

I was thinking of how I wanted magic to work over long periods of time, the degradation of certain elements. How the war that drove the Dwarfs out of this part of the area, an Orcish army I decided with quickly trained necromancers that knew just enough to get the dead raised and swinging a sword again. What had stayed with someone for 1000 years what went away, everything was perfect the exact right thing to do to try to reach the humanity of this skeleton.

I sat there so long with this bewildered look on my face calculating the world in my head so long my players asked if I was ok COMPLETELY unaware of the dam they had broken in my world forcing it to flood into my head. I told them I needed time but it was worth it trust me!

Finally I had him respond in kind and they started talking and eventually the Dwarf invited them into the room and they sat and talked about what happened there the story of the empire and how the dwarven military caste was almost completly wiped out in the war with the Orcs.

They went to the Dwarven King and requested on the soldiers behalf to be resurrected as was par with their terms of service (how do you get someone to sign up for the volunteer army? Promise to rezz him if he should die).
They did not get audience with the king they got a minister who said they did not have the money to rezz everyone in all of those contracts.
The Party found the current head of the Dwarf armed forces, a fat sleepy man who was only 1/45th military caste who had suffered a head wound that was never properly tended to so he tended to go along with what ever anyone said to him. 
They used him to see the King who collected bones from the military caste from all over, rezzed them all in one GIANT lot and resuscitated his kingdom by mobilizing his people with a renewed war on the Giants.

They were heros of the dwarven people from them on and got 3 story statues of them carved in the ""Hall of honored notDwarfs!"" and reversed the fate of an entire kingdom with a simple hello.

TL;DR: starter party, said hello to an ancient skeleton, got to know the dwarf King, rezzed about 500k dwarves, saved the empire, got statues. ",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_15id7x,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/15id7x/tales_of_the_dm_wondering_if_any_one_else_has_a/,

Original Post: [The Amazing r/DnD Dungeon](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1h0kw7/the_amazing_rdnd_dungeon/?sort=new)

I apologize if my original post was unclear. This is meant as a ridiculous, typical dungeon with minimal plot (unless you want to make it have one) that merely served the purpose of a community project for fun. Now what we've got going so far is really good. 

It was brought to my attention by [Two_Plus_Two_Is_Ten](http://www.reddit.com/user/Two_Plus_Two_Is_Ten) that many people may not want to make ""empty"" rooms, but they could be anything from rooms with creepy noises to rooms with statues that ""look as though they are ready to attack at any moment."" Be creative if you'd like, but I can always add them in myself.

The other thing that I notice is that what we have so far is mostly puzzles/traps. They're well and good, but we need some combat. I don't care if you look up a sample encounter in your Monster Manual and just throw it in there, but please give us some fun, flavorful combat.

Also, based on a suggestion from [Deep_Matrix](http://www.reddit.com/user/Deep_Matrix), I think that we'll make the dungeon 16 areas/rooms rather than the original 15. The first 8 will be level 5, and the last 8 will be level 6. I think a sub-boss would be appropriate in room 8 and the real boss should be in room 16. 

I've also decided to use a format suggested by Deep_Matrix. The format for posts is as follows:

* Room Number- Title (title not required)

* Description/Flavor Text

* Challenge(This will be either the combat, trap description and    solution, or challenge description.)

* Loot

I'll do an example using my Room 0 from the original post.

EXAMPLE (please use this format):

**Room 0- Cavern Entrance**

**Description:** Carved into the side of a mountain, this small cave was once home to a group of bandits that are now gone. The cavern is full of rotted crates and empty barrels. In the far back of the cave is a metal door that is ornate in design (Dungeoneering DC 20- The door is of ancient dwarven design). It leads further into the mountain.

**Challenge:** Enter the dungeon. 

**Loot:** 2 rusty longswords and a rusty longspear can be found behind one of the crates (Perception DC 15). 

Please do not repeat any rooms. At this point I've also realized that we do not need to go in order. I also would request that those that commented with those awesome ideas on the original post designate room numbers to their challenges and re-comment on this post in the new format to have their ideas included. 

Remember, the idea is fun, but please make everything level-appropriate. My 4 level 5 PCs can't take on a Dracolich or anything. 

**When it is done I will be posting the final version of the dungeon.**

Now [BalrogTheLunchbox](http://www.reddit.com/user/BalrogTheLunchbox) presented an awesome idea: 

&gt; Before everyone starts just building, how about this instead. Each parent comment gives a theme, backstory, location, and additional details as to what the dungeon is. From there, each reply to the parent is a room that chains down. This will help to keep a consistency to each dungeon and allow for a number of dungeons to be created, allowing users pick a theme they like.

This combined with the awesome ideas that I've been seeing made me think- would this be a good idea for a new subreddit? The OP will give the dungeon's edition, theme, intended level, location, and room number. From there the comments will build the dungeon for the person making the request. Leave me a footnote if you think that this is a good idea!

Again, thank you all for your creativity, support, comments, suggestions, and dungeon-building expertise. I love this subreddit. Everyone on r/DnD, you rock!

**EDIT-** I'm going to keep track of room numbers completed down here (please look for yourselves- I'm not watching this all day and repeats are void). All rooms completed.

Seriously, my game is on the verge of collapse here...",thegeeksmith,73,7,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1cc5yq/dm_issue_how_to_deal_with_a_player_that_nobody/,"So, I've been DMing my first game and for the most part it's gone swimmingly. We're a small group, 3 players, myself and an occasional drop in that plays npcs. This game is almost completely custom content and some of our rules are homebrew (ok more like a lot). This is for many reasons, but mainly to deal with individual dislikes for the overall 4e system. That's not the issue though. Two of my players are first timers, the third a long time player. We'll call the player the others and myself are having an issue with Joe. Joe is one of the first time players and is only friends with myself. The others are not close with him or don't know him as well. After last night's game, I don't know what to do. My other two players (the other first timer and the vet) are absolutely fantastic for the most part, they stay in character, try to find interesting ways of solving problems, role play SUPER well with each other and my npcs and and generally play this game like it's meant to be played. Joe, on the other hand, has some issues. 

Sorry to be so long winded, but here goes:

-He writes fantasy fiction. He's brought in a character from his stories that he is dead set on having be the baddest mofo out there ... at level 5...
-He has asked repeatedly to shoehorn in characters from this story (which takes place in an entirely dif. world) for the purpose only of his character getting to interact with his other characters. 
-He is EXTREMELY hostile towards one of our party members and rude as well both in game and meta. 
-the worst for me, he only pays attention when it's his turn (sometimes not even then) he plays on his phone/laptop and looks at semi-porn like images and acts bored and butthurt if he doesn't get his way. 
-His character rides roughshot over everyone else who has valid Ideas. 

So, last night I almost killed him. I could have, many times, but pulled my punches. 

The group is frustrated, I'm frustrated and he's just fine with that. My issue is, he responds awfully irl to criticism and judgement and the standard kick him out of the game, will likely result in a rift in our real life friendship. What do I do r/dnd? 

TLDR: Rude player rides roughshot over party and at the same time doesn't pay attention to the game at all. He also shoehorns in his character from his fantasy novel that doesnt exist in our world, and continually expects our DnD game to be a sandbox game for his character. Also extremely mean to one of my players, but is super sensitive and can't take criticism. 

Thanks for any advice. 

Edit/Update: 

So our game was last night and TLDR: It went 100% better ... ok 95%. 

I talked to ""joe"" a couple days before the game and it went pretty good. I explained in delicate terms that I was not happy with the way the previous week's game had gone. He then surprised me by saying he knew he wasn't a great participant last week and that he was sorry. I was kind of shocked but very relieved. The rest was pretty simple. I conveyed with him that the hostility towards other players and meta game hate was the exact opposite of the game I wanted to run. He agreed. Fun for all or nothing. I couldn't have expected a more receptive attitude than this. I let the lack of attention go for the time and decided to only bring it up if it was an issue in the next game. It was (but to a much lesser extent, hence the 95%) at one point I stood to see his laptop screen in the reflection of my television, and there were some semi-nude pictures whizzing by. I called him out, jokingly, and he laughed and said ""yea, those were tits. Sorry."". He proceded to pay more attention the rest of the night. All in all we played one of the best games we've played yet. I tried to engage him more to make sure he was having fin too, and knew that I wasn't trying to play favorites. BEST OF ALL, he and the vet player he was having trouble with, worked together like champs. Thanks chiefly, I think, to his improved attitude and some godlike patience and goodwill from my vet player. Thanks again for all the help guys and gals. This sub and your advice absolutely 
helped me in getting perspective and setting my game back on course. 

real TLDR: 

Talked out my major issues with Joe, let the ones that effected only me slide. Decided that FUN is the number one goal. Not just for me, but for Joe as well. All tactics went fantastically and our campaigns ""season finale"" went off with only a single hitch. I caught Joe browsing some PG-13-ish tit images on his laptop, called him out, we laughed it off and went on with our night!

Construction:
I bought a 6'x3' table on craigslist. Then cut and taped a piece of 1/8"" Melamine paneling to the top. Applied a 1"" grid via T square and sharpie. Then over the top I attached a piece of clear plastic that I found at AC Moore. Underneath the table I mounted 5 small speakers through which I play background music.

The entire room in which it sits has become our ""gaming room"" and has several pictures and paintings that fit the genre. We also have a few oil lamps and during gameplay I replace the overhead light with a remote controlled color changing LED light (like the one in this video) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t608e06QiYg


Edit: because I didnt add this the first time around. the next upgrade I will be adding is a small shelving unit that goes all the way around the table with about 3""s or so of space so that one can fit his books and extra paper and such.

It's been going pretty well since then, and we are now playing adventures I've written myself instead of pre-made modules.  The group has been relatively drama free as well, or at least up until now.

 We've had one player that works with all of us, and apart from some minor personality (excessive bragging and whining) and hygiene issues he has been alright.  Two weeks ago he warned one player the day before and me a few hours before that he wouldn't be able to make it.  He had to go see his dad for his dad's birthday. He said it was fine that one of the other guys play his PC for the night.  However, he did not give anyone his character sheet.  I have his basic stats like HP in my DM app, but nothing more.

When we got all set up, I asked any of the PCs if they would want to play his rogue (he had contacted no one about playing for him).  Since they would essentially have to rebuild his character no one wanted the extra work, and I felt the same way.  We agreed to just ""suspend"" his character for the night.  He wouldn't take any damage or do any damage, but he wouldn't receive any XP.

The next day at work, I hear that he has been whining to everyone in the group about being slightly more than a level behind.  It was a long session and the group was able to complete the majority of a quest.  For the rest of the week he would repeatedly bring up how far behind he was and how unfair the situation was.  Eventually he ""jokingly"" told me how he called his dad and told him he wouldn't be able to see him again and that his birthday ruined everything.

I was pretty much done with him at this point.  I firmly told him ""What would you have me do?  Would you have me give you XP for the night despite not contributing?  That would be unfair to the other 5 players who had to face tougher encounters without you there.  They did it short a player, so they were rewarded with a slightly larger cut of the pie.  Now I would have to either take back their portion, or just throw you 1500 XP you did nothing to earn.""

He laughed it off, and he said he was just joking and everything was cool.  This was the day before the next session, which was to be the last of that adventure.  The day of I got a text from another member letting me know that the rogue had quit the group.  He cited other reasons such as too busy, but I'm sure he didn't like getting behind everyone else.  Since he missed a second session even if he came back, which the group isn't sure they want him back, he would be at least 2 levels behind.

Sorry for the big wall of text.  I just wanted to get your opinions on the matter.  Did I handle that correctly?  Should I have given him XP?  Should I have played his PC as best I could for that one night?  I will admit I never invited him in the first place, and I wasn't thrilled about it.

It was also my first game of DnD, period.   A group of friends from work wanted to get a game started and none of us had played before.  We found a couple experienced players from an old job, but they preferred to play instead of DM.  

I decided that since I would want to eventually DM anyway, I would just jump in now.  I went out and grabbed the Red Box kit and played through the solo adventured.  I did the same to the player's handbook and the DM kit.  Something like 400 pages of reading.  I decided to start with the premade adventure in the Red Box so everyone would start at level 1, but I had to sort of ad lib the very beginning to get the players on the correct path.

We had 6 players which was daunting, because of the large group size and the fact that I needed to adjust the encounters accordingly.  Six people wasn't a problem though, we got started at 5:30 but it quickly became 11:30.  Everyone was laughing and getting into it, the players were concerned about dying and eager to continue the adventure. 

I'm moving them on the premade in the DM kit after this to get a bit more experience, but I'm already planning out my first ""from the ground up"" campaign.

This seemed like a wonderful idea, until they ended up on the top of a platinum tower with no real way to get off of it. They didn’t have the capability to take the teleporter back to some other location, so they opted to try and make it off of the big tower.
This involved clambering down into a trap door they found, and ignoring the utter darkness of the interior.
An elderly wizard levelled a staff at them, and asked what the hell they were doing in his tower. You know, not a terribly strange thing.
But our party. OUR party. They ask the DM just how much the staff is worth, and when he tells them it’s worth thirty grand or so, they start to grin.

And grin.

See, our party is the kind that decide that a somewhat aged wizard with a nice staff and just a mild sort of unfriendliness towards the tresspassers makes the perfect target to KILL and ROB.
Don’t they sound heroic?
Well, after our only hero with a conscious tells the wizard that they mean no ill will and are merely lost, the others decide that now that his guard is down, they should fuck up the guy’s day.
The wizard introduces himself as Menras, just in time for the party’s rogue to FUCKING THROW DAGGERS AT HIM. Our warlock tries a curse, and when the wizard proves his might by stopping, immobilizing, and totally stripping them of weapons, they decide that it might be a better idea to wait until he’s SLEEPING to kill him.
Our heroic adventurers earn the wizard’s trust by letting the incredibly diplomatic and only trustworthy member of the party talk them out of the situation.

The wizard Menras quickly has a change of mood and seems jovial to finally have company. However, our not-so-trustworthy members of the party instantly notice that he is clearly a few cards short of a full deck.

Then, Io catches up with the group. Io is an unseemly, sunkissed Drow who has been tagging along on many of the adventures, serving as a trapfinder and general rogue. Being a servant of fucking Lolth didn’t help her popularity with the group, but after killing things with her crossbow and saving some lives, they accepted her into the fold.
Having spent almost two weeks barely surviving down in the Underdarkm half starved, nearly killed on several occassions, and mentally scarred from the loss of two of their companions, the group- as evil as some of them are- make good on the wizard’s hospitality and settle in for the night. In fact, the sleeping goes so well, that nobody bothers to get up to kill Menras in his sleep.

The next morning though... They meet Menras’ familiar. Io is the one who first spots him when she wanders into the lab just over the basement below. Expecting to find a number of magical goods, alchemical reagents, and other such valubles, she instead takes sight of a two-tailed, black cat calmly licking its paw. The cat greats her ambivalently, walking behind one set of beakers and reappearing almost behind her, in a pjhysics warping sort of magic-y way.
Immediately intrigued, and encouraged by the party’s shouts of “Magic cat! It’s worth so much!” and “You’re a Drow! Seduce the little bastard!”, Io begins a little conversation with the cat. The cat politely informs her that he in fact is NOT a cat, and upon further investigation he tells her that he is simply a Not-Cat. Io, incredibly confused and somewhat irritated, snaps at the little guy wondering what she should even call him.

“Well, I suppose you could just call me Knots. Knots the Not-Cat.”
And that’s when they met fucking Knots.
Fucking. Knots.

Now after the initial mini quest that started the game my friends decided to head west to see a decently famous blacksmith because they had things to sell and were looking for things to buy. On the way i was attempting to introduce a side quest about the small cities new crime lord by having 2 hired goons collecting tolls on the way. The party of three guys was essentially a dark elf poison expert ranger, a human spread between necromancy, spell blade, and human elite, and a crack nasty mage type who worshipped the goddess of magic. So the Human was in the front, the guy is generally a great roleplayer so i was expecting some good roleplay with the toll collectors, instead before before i even managed to tell the descriptions of the guys collecting tolls (they were kinda big and scary) he decided to attack them and basically get smeared into the ground. 

So my party ends up killing these guys and the intro to this quest is basically ruined, the human gets killed and has to be resurrected (hich they only had the money to pay for because they got all the toll gold). Unfortunately my friend gets all pissed cuz he died, when it is utterly his fault because he charged at two guys that were clearly stronger than him in an encounter that was supposed to be RP based. 

So my question is have you guys ever had instances were people attacked someone they shouldn't and payed the price? and how did you deal with it afterwards. Should i have let him die like i did by using the full power of my npc's like i did? or would there have been another solution

I think it's used as a scapegoat in most cases and a crutch in others. Now, it's also a very valuable in-game tool, since many of D&amp;D's mechanics revolve around whether a character is Chaotic or Lawful/Good or Evil. Nearly every player I've had in my games tends to default to Chaotic Neutral to avoid being ""limited by alignment"". It's difficult for many players to understand that alignment does not mean ""I am one specific cliched behavior. I cannot deviate."" 

Chaotic Neutral tends to also get abused by those that realize they are playing a game and want to treat it like a sandbox game. This in mind, I've proposed a houserule that should restrict these excuses and urge people to roleplay their character.

Players will not be allowed to choose an alignment. A character must be roleplayed based on the character's background as written by the player. The alignment space on the character sheet will be kept blank. The DM (me) will keep roleplay notes on each character behind the screen and score their alignments based on their in-game choices and reasoning. All characters default to True Neutral, unless their class has alignment specific requirements. The players will never be personally aware of their in-game alignment leaning. (This will surprise characters that encounter alignment-judging spells and effects, too.)

Without that alignment stat on character sheets, player decisions will become much more transparent. It will be much easier for everyone to see if the player is truly roleplaying, or just taking advantage of the fact that they are playing a game. Naturally, such behavior will have consequences. I just want people to roleplay in the game and think in terms or their character, not in terms of the stat on their sheet.

1371533543.0,58,self.DnD,1gkhhe,Unsure how to deal with in-game/out-game issue,NineFive83,73,15,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1gkhhe/unsure_how_to_deal_with_ingameoutgame_issue/,"Howdy y'all. I'm playing my first DnD game with a few other first timers (our DM is a bit more seasoned). Tonight in our game, my character (a rogue with low HP) had an item, and our tank (a fighter w/ twice as much HP) wanted me to show the item to another character I didn't trust. He kept insisting even though I didn't trust the NPC, and so he attacked me (he's lawful good, BTW). He rolled my AC, took half my HP, so I decided to show the guy the item, which resulted in no real info. Later, I tried to get the character to apologize for the blow, to which he refused, even though our other 3 PCs said it was uncalled for. Because of this, I used my diplomacy skill with other NPCs to think he was untrustworthy and ""try"" to kill him (I knew they wouldn't be able to because he's pretty OP). During the fight, he literally exclaimed ""if I die during this fight, I quit"" (as in, the whole campaign, in which the DM then decided to lower the opponents HP). After we had finished for the night, he continued making jabs at me when another gamer brought up our skirmish, using the clichéd ""Yeah, it was only a two hit fight, me hitting Ninefive83, and him hitting the ground."" And yeah, he used my name and not my character's. I'm not sure if I should be bothered by his arrogance towards the game (he is uber-competitive in real life as well), if I should speak to him directly, or to the DM, about feeling like he's bullying characters, and the fact that this is a cooperative story where everyone works together, despite alignments.

TL;DR Playing with someone who feels like the need to ""win"" DnD, and unsure how to approach that it's a team exercise.

edit: me no good with spelling

Edit 2: Wow. I never expected quite this response. I really appreciate all the input from everyone. To be fair, I don't think our DM is  bad, he's DMing for the first time in a few years, and he constantly has this guy over his shoulder. I've done a few rule checks on the guy as well (""uhm... you can't get a shield AC bonus with a two handed weapon""), and our characters have had spats in the past (I bought rancid meat to put into a pie for him, but our cleric, thinking I was going to eat it myself, purified it. That actually turned out really funny). That's the type of thing my rogue does. But a stomachache isn't going to do 50% of HP to a high constitution fighter. Unfortunately, I really don't think I'm going to keep playing with the group, not only because it isn't much fun to be bossed around, but they mostly meet nights/weekends and I'm going back to an old job that primarily takes up that time period. Thanks again for the help, and I really don't feel bad if this makes the guy think he's ""won,"" because he'll likely never find another group that'll put up with him. If anyone knows of games around Lafayette, LA, I'd love to find a more RP heavy group to join.

UPDATE: Talked to our DM today and he agreed on all my points (much more than I expected even) and admitted that he didn't do a good job of stressing how big of a fracture an unprovoked attack to a PC would be to the fighter. He also told me another player (a better friend to the fighter than both I and the DM), approached him and complained that the fighter was being ""childish"" and ""whiny."" And another player told me today that his ""whiny baby hissy fit"" was both hilarious and embarrassing to behold. So its not just me.

I'm not really familiar with the game yet and just got back feeling that I needed to share this story.

Earlier in the year my friend told me he'd be starting up a Pathfinder campaign. My older brother played it in high school and I'm really interested in learning. Our party is a rag tag group of pirates whose captain just died and is now being lead by a crazed barbarian known as ""Mad Hatter"" who is fueled by rum. The first job we've taken involves sneaking into a party at a high class mansion to acquire a magically sealed bottle in the basement and as a bonus, killing the host of the party without rousing suspicion. The door to said basement was guarded, so we began by mingling with the other guests. Our ""captain"" and alchemist headed to the bar getting ready to pull of a distraction so the rest of us could get into the basement unseen. While the ""captain"" caused a rucks, our rogue bluffed the guard to rush off in a hurry, but another one saw this act and came to confront us. He was deflected by another bluff pointing him towards our ""captain"". We had averted attention away from the basement and just needed an opportune moment to enter.

Then things got interesting to say the least.

The host of the party noticed our presence and came to see what we were up to. Our rogue, female on an off point, casually noted ""Oh, I thought this was the way to your bedroom."" That got him away from us with her around his arms, then our gunslinger had the best idea ever. He tossed his glove in the face of the host challenging him in a duel for her affection. That got most of the guests outside and we were finally prepared to make our move when the guard we directed to the ""captain"" was sent flying 20 feet landing at our feet bursting through a door. Luckily most had already cleared out for the duel and the rest were too afraid to do anything. Meanwhile, the duel was set, our rogue had planned to daze the host quickly so the gunslinger could cap him before anyone was the wiser, however both failed their rolls leaving our intrepid gunslinger at the hosts mercy. In a twist of fate, the host himself missed leaving all to the ridicule of the crowd. Everyone was so preoccupied by the collective failure that they all failed to notice the strange character casting off to the side. In a moment, a bolt of lighting struck the host barely leaving him alive. The character slipped out, nobody realizing they were even there, except for out ""captain"", though he had an amazing idea. approaching the guards he boldly stated ""EVERYONE STOP! I'M A DOCTOR!"". His bluff is terrible, but our rogue supports him in the matter and they allow him to approach the unconscious, crispy host. His heal is also 0 and rolling a 4 didn't help. He took some of the rum that he keeps on him at all times and starts pouring down the host's throat which the guards didn't exactly appreciate. They barely managed to pull him off, but our captain took one of them and flipped them onto the crispy, chocking on run host. Since everyone assumed he died by the lightning, we got away with it, and everyone else successfully entered the basement. 

Best assassination ever, and we still have to figure out what's waiting for us in the basement. Finally, I'm sorry for this wall of text, thank you if you took the time to read it all. Have a wonderful morning/day/evening.

A good friend of mine runs an epic level campaign (based off of monster hunter) whenever we don't have the right players for another campaign. I play a heavy blademaster human, carrying a gargantuan broadsword. My other friend is a 12 ft. tall ogre that uses a tree (branches and all) as a club. We had a new player with us this time who wanted to be a shapeshifter, so we let her, and my other friend who was a druid with high str for whatever reason.

So we get to this city that's been being terrorized by a colossal Minotaur and we are the ones that have to kill this thing. Being the leader that doesn't like having my group help me, I charge, creating an attack of opportunity, that this monster succeeds, smacking me through a building, bringing down the foundation. After a few rounds of my team fighting this thing, then my ogre buddy coming to find me, I awaken to see this thing wrecking us. I hatch a plan.

I yell out to my druid and tell him to use telepathic link on everyone, and I explain my plan: ""Ogre is going to launch me up to that 300ft building, and I'll jump onto it's head, bringing my sword down onto it."" My team likes the idea. Orge picks me up, places me on the end of his tree and swings for the fences, at the optimal point, I leap. Both of us rolling really high didn't help me get up high enough.

Before I know it, our new shapeshifter changed to a dragon and has lifted me by my shoulders, while keeping momentum, flings me up even higher. Still not high enough, I see the druid jumping around from building to building on his huge dire tiger. Casting bull's strength on himself, grabs my arm and rolls a nat20 to launch me further up.

By this time, I'm well above this building, close to 400ft high. Spotting my target, I roll to hit. NAT(MUTHAFUGGIN')20. Confirm crit. I flip (like kirby's up B in smash bros) and come down 400ft at extremely high velocity directly onto his head. We create a gigantic crater, I take fall damage, almost killing me, dealing close to 1000 damage to this thing, and only about 250 to me. 

Turns out that this thing had a lot more health than we thought. It survived the damage, but barely, and our big stupid ogre barbarian asks if we can cook it. Being CG, I'm not opposed to cooking this thing, that was terrorizing these city people, alive and feeding the entire city along with our group AND the people from our original town with leftovers.

This post will be linked in the sidebar for all to see, and will be heavily curated to remain relevant and optimized.



The following resources are divided into some specific categories, based on whether they're for PCs, NPCs, specific editions, etc.

**Character Sheets**

[Wizards of the Coast Official Character Sheets](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/charactersheet) [free] - These are the official character sheets for the latest commercially available iteration of Dungeons and Dragons. They are downloadable PDFs, and have slots for basically every aspect of your character, from player name to racial feats. In tandem with a rulebook, they will keep you abreast of every facet of your character. *4e*

[The Character Sheet Archive](http://www.dragonfang.com/archive/dungeons/dunge_01.htm) [free] - These were the official character sheets released by TSR (who owned D&amp;D before Wizards of the Coast). They include character sheets, spell sheets, DM sheets, etc, and remain available for most old editions of the game. *1e, 2e, 3e*

[ADnD Download Sheets](http://www.adnddownloads.com/sheets.php) [free] - These sheets are special in that they are entirely user created, so they don't necessarily conform to the ""official"" ones. The real advantage, though, are how some of the older sheets work. More experienced players will remember the days of spreadsheets and excel files being used to calculate stats, and those exist here for most of the older editions. Just type in your stats, and your ability mods will all be calculated for you! As a bonus, this site houses a few select character sheets in French. *2e, 3e, 3.5e, PF, 4e*

[Myth-Weavers](http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheetindex.php) [free] - Once you've registered on the website, you can enter and update character sheets, including basically every version of D&amp;D. Even better, you can share your character sheets with the other people in your group, and they can see updates as they are made. *all editions*

**Character Builders (PCs)**

[WotC Character Builder](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/characterbuilder) [$9.95 a month] - The official Wizards character builder is a powerhouse. It guides you through the character creation process from beginning to end, and incorporates every single rulebook, campaign setting, and Dragon Magazine officially released. It does not always handle homebrew rules very well (so you will sometimes have to fudge your numbers to reflect DM created items, for example) but with such a large compendium to draw from, you can usually find SOMETHING to fit your rules. The subscription to the builder is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons Insider (DDI) account, and with that you get not only the character builder, but access to [The Compendium](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Tool.aspx?x=dnd/4new/tool/compendium) (an appendix of all things D&amp;D), several online magazines, entry to the beta for D&amp;D Next, etc. Tiered pricing is available for multi-month subs. *4e*

[Hero Lab](http://www.wolflair.com/index.php?context=hero_lab) [$20, additional modules individually priced] - This very powerful character builder is one of the most refined outside of WotC. You can create characters from start to finish using TONS of modules, and update them according to the rulesets. Allows for more flexibility than the official builder, as well as allowing plug-ins from additional modules. It's a little pricey, but unlike the official builder, it's not a subscription, so if you really like one or two modules, you'll save in the long run. *3.5e, PF, 4e*

[PCGen](http://pcgen.sourceforge.net/01_overview.php) [free] - This downloadable program prides itself on its adherence to the Open Gaming License (OGL) that allows publishers to print their own modules for the D20 system, and has deals with many publishers to include their material in PCGen itself. The number of modules is very impressive, it has a nice interface, it's opensource, it's very well maintained, and there is a wealth of wiki help and documentation. *I have not personally vetted this program yet, from what I can tell it's for 3.5e, but it may include others as well*

[4e Character Builder](http://www.lukerymarz.com/apps/characterbuilder/CharacterBuilder.html#) [free] - This bare bones (and no longer actively maintained) character builder will let you build a character based on some of the originally released 4th Edition books. They still require knowledge of specific powers, but it's enough to help you build a solid character for your first adventure or so, especially if you have a more experienced player helping you. *4e*

[HeroForge](http://nzcomputers.net/heroforge/default35.asp) [free] - If you like spreadsheets, you are in luck. HeroForge contains spreadsheets for every kind of character, spell, or NPC imaginable. The amount of coverage of 3.5e is almost ridiculous, but there is plenty of stuff here for Pathfinder, and some for 4e as well. *3.5e, PF, 4e*

**NPC Generators**

[donjon RPG Tools](http://donjon.bin.sh/4e/random/#npc) [free] - What initially looks like a very basic generator is actually a [very powerful set of tools](http://donjon.bin.sh/) for randomly generating everything from NPCs backstories, to dungeons layouts, to entire worlds. They require next to zero knowledge of the game, and can be used on the fly, so DMs of all skill levels can add a lot of depth to their game-world. *Any edition*

[Pathguy Character Generator](http://www.pathguy.com/cg35.htm) [free] - This generator (which is also available in [4e](http://www.pathguy.com/cg4.htm) and [PF](http://www.pathguy.com/PathfinderCore.htm) flavors) is a MUCH more complex version of the typical character generators. It allows you to control every aspect of character generation, so if you need to, say, build an entire village of Dwarven Barbarians, you can do just that! It's not recommended for beginners, and it's not a quick process, but if used effectively ahead of time, it can be quite powerful. Also useful as a full-fledged character builder. *3.5e, PF, 4e*

[Dragonsfoot](http://www.dragonsfoot.org/fe/articles/1echargen.shtml) [free] - This could actually be included in PC or NPC, but because of the simplicity, I choose this. Instantly generates a 1e character. Incredibly simple and straightforward. *1e*

1374225243.0,55,self.DnD,1imdx3,Alignment Court: Is my LN cleric evil?,luxoflax,72,17,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1imdx3/alignment_court_is_my_ln_cleric_evil/,"**Tl;DR:** My St. Cuthbert cleric committed two acts my GM ruled as evil worthy of an alignment shift:

1) preemptively smashing the head of a corpse in a necromancer's lair (after we'd already faced multiple undead attacks)

2) burning an unintelligible prayer book discovered in the lead necromancer's personal office



 **Players and GMs of DnD! I call upon you for a ruling in this Alignment Court**!

 Please share your thoughts on my last session. Is my cleric evil? Should he suffer an alignment shift? Is the GM's ruling fair? Why does Firefox's auto correct want to change ""aspergillum"" to ""paper girl""?

In a new campaign with my group I'm playing as a LN cleric of St. Cuthbert. I consider my cleric to be a hardcore devotee: I used some of his starting gold to get him a silver necklace of St. Cuthbert, a prayer book, and even an aspergillum (ranged holy water thrower).

In our current quest we are exploring a monastery that was once good but had been twisted by an evil guild of necromancers. Every single corpse we'd come upon would either rise as a zombie or be host to spider hatchlings.

After already facing ten of these ""Surprise! It's a zombie!"" attacks I now fully distrusted all bodies we encountered.

We went into a room and saw a body that ""shows signs of having committed suicide."" I asked if his body was intact and was told it was. I announced that my cleric would be remaining 5ft away and would be issuing a prayer from his book to St. Cuthbert to save the body's soul and guide him from evil.

I then declared I'd be bashing his head in with my mace before he rises as the undead. My GM insisted that would be an evil act I couldn't do because I would be ""desiccating a corpse"". I pointed out that it was a corpse, possibly undead, in a lair of evil necromancers.

GM insisted that as a LN cleric I couldn't go around smashing the heads of bodies and that he could've been a good guy before he died, which would make my actions evil. I countered that he was wearing the robes of the evil order, in a bedroom barred from the inside, and he had committed suicide. My deity does not let evil actions stand and my character isn't stupid enough to risk another zombie attack in closed quarters.

After much bickering it was declared that my cleric could smash his head in, but that he'd be taking evil points.

In the next room we found the cult leader's desk. It was covered in symbols we couldn't read but we could detect evil around the desk. Doing a search, I was able to find a hidden drawer that contained ""a prayer book, but not in a language you can read"". I asked if a knowledge religion roll could provide any details but my roll (18) told me nothing.

I declared that I'd be calling on St. Cuthbert's name and burning the book to prevent the spread of evil and evil thoughts. Again, the GM insists I'll be taking massive evil points for ""burning another religion's holy book.""

Once more I defended the need to stop what my cleric saw as an evil threat in a room that was totally evil. 

The GM argued that I couldn't read the book so I didn't know whether it was evil. Maybe it was the prayer book from the previously un-evil occupants. He said that ""ignorance of an evil act is still an evil act.""

I argued that the tenants of St. Cuthbert work not only to maintain order but also to prevent the faithful from losing the path. From all the knowledge my cleric had to go on; it would make perfect sense to burn the book. I'd be stopping evil and ""wrong"" ways of thought, thus keeping the order St. Cuthbert looks to maintain. 

He ruled that this action, combined with my previous act, should shift my cleric's alignment from LN to LE. This would disconnect me from my god (among other issues).

What is your verdict?

**Edit:** Thanks for all your replies! The general consensus seems to be that my cleric is NOT an evil cleric, he is just a LN cleric intent on destroying the undead before the GM can railroad our party into death by undead.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,1374245791.0,,,True,t3_1imdx3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1imdx3/alignment_court_is_my_ln_cleric_evil/,

However some of my PCs are a mix of 'Chaotic Stupid' and just plain stupid. Here is a few of the many examples.

1. I made a minor mystery where the players encounter an unconscious NPC on the road, one of the PCs  immediately decides the best course of action is to cut his head off, luckily the NPC was already dead anyway, but they didn't know that. So I let it slide and tell them they find a journal and 2 flasks on his person. The flasks are labeled 'invisibility potions', but after some testing of the potions and reading the journal they find that the potions actually are just a strong acid that dissolves whatever it touches and the dead NPC believed he made an invisibility potion (which he dies after drinking). After finding this out, one of the PCs drinks one of the potions anyway and threatens to quit if I were to kill him for drinking something he knew quite well would kill him. So I decided instead to merely dissolve his tongue, and to make fun of him I told him he couldn't speak using his tongue until he found a way to fix it, but he again threatened to quit if I went through with it. 
Edit: From the feedback I'm getting I decided that I'm going to warn him to not do anything so stupid again and just ignore his threats if he does decide to go and do something like this again.

2. One of my PCs made a Goliath paladin who was specifically made because I told him I didn't want any giant or Goliath PCs in my campaign, after some bickering I decided that it was hopeless, so I let it go. 

Edit: I've been working on just simply making fun of his character through out the story just to mock him for his character choice. Hes been pretty dumb in the campaign so I'm going to have most of the NPCs treat him that way.

3. The same Goliath PC; after talking to an NPC who told him to steer clear of a certain 'fancy hunter for sport' NPC who I made as a higher level encounter, decided the best course of action was to instead walk right into said hunter NPC's face and attract his attention. So as a result I had the Hunter NPC give the PC 50 gold 'to buy yourself something nice' and a 3 day head-start before the hunter would begin to pursue the PC. However the issue with this is that the encounter I have set up is way too hard for the PCs to stand up against at their low level. 

Edit: I decided due to one of the comments I'm going to beat the snot out of the Paladin (and any party member who decides to try and intervene) but not kill him out of him not putting up a real fight. As a result he will be mocked by the town when the hunter brings news of his feebleness.

4. One of my PCs only decision in any situation is to kill an NPC or to try and kill an NPC. While I could easily create repercussions to kill him or just say ""you can't do that"" I feel both ideas wouldn't be good solutions. 

Edit: We decided to not let him play in the next session, hes the only party member I don't think I can set straight.

They told me they had fun in the last session we had and they want to play again, but at the same time I feel somewhat frustrated by their decision making and my inability to properly punish them. Should I let them do what they want since they're having fun, or are there good ways to discipline them without ruining the game for one or more people?

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice and criticism everyone, I really appreciate it! From what I gathered I'm hoping I can put this game back on track. Ill make an update post in a week or so. Thanks again.

So yesterday's game, I send my party on a side quest from our main storyline to get some items from an old elven shrine. The whole place is a series of puzzle/trap rooms. 

The party comes to a room that's just a giant 50' pit, with the hallway continuing on the other side from where they're at. It has an invisible walkway through it, a la Indiana Jones. Previously in the place, they had defeated a caryatid golem. When I was writing the adventure, I figured one of them would grab some of the dust from the defeated golem (one of my players is the ""TAKE ALL THE THINGS!!"" kind of guy), and they'd use that to discover the hidden pathway. He had unfortunately called sick though, so he wasn't there.

After standing at the entrance of this room for a bit, on of my players (Spiral13 here on Reddit) said, ""I'm going to piss in the pit."" So, I told him that it started pooling in the air. He took the cue, and the party took turns pissing their way through the room to follow the walkway.

We decided to try to introduce our young kids to it. We have twins that are five and another son that is three. We didn't use miniatures and cut the dice rolling down to a minimum to keep things simple. We were a little worried that they wouldn't really understand the open-endedness of it. 

The very first thing we did was walk down some steps into a crypt. I tried to explain so that they wouldn't be too freaked out, ""It's dark down there, but there are torches on the walls so we can still see."" One of the five-year-old immediately said, ""Oh, I want to take one of the torches in case we come to a place that's dark!""

In the first main room there were two statues. We searched one and found a switch. My wife warned them to be careful because it might be trapped. The other five-year-old spoke up and said he wanted to use his stick (quarterstaff) to flip the switch from far away!

Over the course of the hour or so that we played we found a secret room, opened a trapped chest, snuck into a room that had spiders waiting in ambush, and used the torch we had picked up earlier to light the spider webs on fire to kill the spiders.

We had many interesting adventures, but this one takes place within the first full length campaign we ever played in 4th edition.

Within the history of this world, an evil sorcerer had been executed. However, the instant he died, gravity reversed for one minute, resulting in the deaths of nearly 90% of everyone.

The sorcerer returned as a Lich, and the victims of the whacky gravity were his undead minions.

As we created our characters, we each needed an excuse for why our character survived. Dwarves in their caves, Elves grabbed tree branches and held on for dear life, etcetera. My solution, of course, was that my character landed on a trampoline. Surprisingly, the DM accepted this, and we moved on, a few members shaking heads at my silliness. After the incident, the survivors gathered in small cities, each one covered with a large canopy to protect the residents from similar upward falling calamities.

The party leader was a [Fey Corgi](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Setting:Unified_Setting/Corgyn) Warlord, and several gnomes, halflings, and kobolds rounded our party out to be generally small sized. We adopted the name Minimus Maximus and proceeded to powergame without shame.

My character was a Kobold fighter, and as a weapon she wielded an extremely large spork which counted as a trident in game terms.

The notable incident happened, as they are so prone to do, during the final boss battle. A half-lich black dragon confronted us in the largest city in the game. I rolled poorly on my initiative, so by the time my turn came around, three party members were already on top of the dragon, which was flying around the city and generally breaking everything.

The DM informed me that a long rope hung from the canopy not far from where the dragon was flying past, so I ran over to it and climbed as far as I could. Unfortunately, this still put me a couple squares away from the dragon.

But Kobolds are shifty, so I simply declared that I would shift a single square straight towards the dragon.

""But you can't shift through difficult terrain."" The DM declared, to which I responded, ""It's not difficult, there is literally *nothing* in my way!""

Despite this obvious subversion of the intended rules, I was allowed to shift through midair. I then activated one of my abilities, which would allow me to either shift twice more and then attack, or shift, then attack, then shift again. The second shift brought me right next to the Dragon, at which point I stabbed it, then used my next shift to get onto its back with my compatriots.

And that, my friends, is how I did a triple jump in Dungeons and Dragons.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_1azpw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1azpw9/sometimes_a_bend_in_the_rules_results_in/,

For instance our fighter was fighting with 2 weapons which grants him disadvantage and he though - well, since I have disadvantage already, might as well be drunk, because it gives me damage reduction. That led us to an idea, that whatever you do, that grants you disadvantage - you might as well do it drunk. Unproficient with weapons? Do it drunk. Unproficent with armor? Do it drunk. etc. It can also be stacked with Composed Attack maneuver. So this seems like an abusable rule in many conditions. What do you guys think?

1347994006.0,60,self.DnD,103c3t,Paladins and Morality (DnD Next),eL_Jacho,74,14,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/103c3t/paladins_and_morality_dnd_next/,"Warning: Wall of Text (Sorry!)

So, I was mildly bummed when I saw how they brought back the old DnD alignment.  To give you some back-story, as I learned DnD I only knew two kinds of people who used the alignment system: people choosing Chaotic Neutral so they could do whatever without penalty, or people who turn into robotic Morality Hunters, ""The Thief did a bad thing by pick pocketing the bartender.  My Paladin attacks him.""

I know this doesn't represent all DnD gamers AT ALL, but it really pushed me away from the nine alignments, and when DnD next brought it back I got into a discussion with my friend about Paladins and whether they should be Lawful good.  I mean, Paladins' real world equivalents were warrior monks like Templars and Knights Hospitaller, and they sure as shit did morally questionable things.  Is butchering a thief morally questionable?  If a Drow Paladin always does what his goddess wants, never strays from his oath, and works to make his homeland stronger, can he be defined as evil?  (Maybe by his enemies, but from his peoples' perspective he's just a hardworking guy fighting for his city)  You'd think with the multitude of gods with different edicts, codes, creeds, commandments, etc., that there would be ALL KINDS OF MORAL GRAY among people of different heritages and backgrounds.

This brought me to a conclusion:  Paladins shouldn't have alignments; they should have Deity-specific codes.  With all of the different forms of ethics out there, what makes a LG (Lawful Good) Paladin different from a LG cleric, or just a LG person?  Simple: their Code.

Just for simplicity, I came up with a simple example code for Paladins of Bahamut (note that clerics don't take this oath.  This is a Code specifically for those who wish to be honored soldiers, not priests):

""In Life: live by the law of the land and serve it well, unless it conflicts with the CODE.  Such lands are abominable.

In Others: Shepherd and lead the Weak, for the cannot care for themselves.  Teach them the LAW.

In Battle: Kill your enemies swiftly and Honor them as Foe, lest you incur Dishonor.

In Scorn:  Be wary disciples of Tiamat, lest her wicked tongues corrupt the hearts of the Weak.  Of all servants, hers can be tolerated Not.  Fight Whispers with Words, Darkness with Light, and Malice with JUSTICE.""

With something like this, with 2 to 5 codes, the Paladin now has a direction, a purpose, and a reference for handling morally questionable situations.  Also, there is enough wiggle room in a code like this to explain why Paladins for Bahamut might sack a town or murder someone.  It's justice, but it might not be your justice.

This was just an idea I threw to a friend of mine over the phone, and wanted to see if anyone here thinks something like this might work.  Let me know what you think! 

tl;dr Paladins should have a simple, religion specific Code instead of an alignment to help define his character.

EDIT: Slightly veering off topic, but my personal favorite was a code I made for Paladins of Vecna:

Many of them come from classic fantasy such as Lord of the Rings, and DnD in particular is heavily influenced by classic western European folk lore. But in the context of a world like DnD, some of them make no sense.

**Graveyards** are an excellent example. Every town seems to have one or more. Ranging from huge stone mausoleums to holes in the ground, graveyards are everywhere.

No consider necromancy. In a DnD world where magic (necromancy in particular) is not only normal but reasonably common, why would you *ever* bury a body intact? Animate Dead is a 3rd level cleric spell, so a 5th level character could reasonably turn a graveyard into a small army. Why take that risk?

One could reasonably argue that there is the possibility of being resurrected. But consider the tradeoff: How likely is someone to raise you from the dead, compared to how likely you are to be killed by zombies. Raise dead costs 5000gp and a 5th level spell, while raise dead costs 25gp per hit die of undead. Raising those peasants is going to get really expensive.

So: What's the point of graveyards? Do you have them in your games? How do you explain them? What do you use instead?

http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1exp50/introducing_kids_to_the_game/

This weekend, my nephews came over to visit. They are aged 7 and 9. They've been very receptive to other board games that I've introduced them to (Lords of Waterdeep, Quarriors, Antike, Forbidden Island), and so Saturday night we sat down to our first game of D&amp;D. The issue, of course, is that my D&amp;D experience is very limited. I've really only seriously played in one game, and tried to DM a few times to no real success.

So with absolutely no experience amongh the four of us, our cast of characters consisted of:

**Myself** - as the easily amused Dungeon Master

**My Wife** - as Venom, the Tiefling fighter 

**Albert** - the Dragonborn rogue (9)

**Lotso** - the Halfling Warlord. (7)

I had each of the players ""roll up"" a character sheet. That is, I sat them down, asked their names, and walked through the races and classes for in the fourth edition players handbook and just had them pick whatever looked cool.

Then we rolled 4D6, and discarded the lowest for each stat. I promptly forgot these stats and determined that it would all be done by straight D20 roll on whether or not they pass various checks, but wanted the kids to have the experience of finding out what their stats were. From these stats, we determined who the smartest player was in their group, who the fattest was, and who the strongest was.

The wife then got creative and made them some quick costumes. We made our halfling nephew fat, and gave our dragonborn nephew some convincing leather armor, and everyone got cloaks. To set the mood, she turned off all the lights in the house, and lit candles. I'm told this made it ""even more spooky"".

We started with ""The Keep on the Shadowfell"", as I had that source material close at hand, but quickly discarded it as it became really unnecessary. Soon, they were banging on the mayor's door looking for jobs to do. Just running with this, I sent them on a mission to rescue the mayor's daughter who was being held in a dungeon outside of town. Upon arriving at the dungeon entrance there was a giant spider they had to battle, followed by a trap-laden hallway and an ambush.

--------

Naturally, I'm leaving out a lot. It was a complete success though. Playing with kids is like cheating - imagination comes so easily to them that stories were just popping up from details that were only implied. The most satisfying was when I dropped them off at my brother's house and they started begging him to immediately play D&amp;D with them.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_1h010k,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1h010k/introducing_kids_to_the_game_a_followup/,

These are mostly just rough traps or trap concepts that prey on specific aspects of a party's adventuring style. I hope you all enjoy!

Antimagic Pulse: Every (1D4 +1) Rounds an antimagic pulse eminates from a generator (TBC) and dispels all magical effects on the characters as Greater Dispel. Suppresses effects of magical items.

Adamantine Warriors: Evil creatures bearing the Mark of a villain also wear corresponding amulets. (DC 30 to notice). 2 Rounds after being slain the Flesh of the creatures has turned to adamantium, and the function as constructs, regain full hit points, and have hardness of 15.
 
Antimagic Assassins: Rogues with SR 25,  ability to detect and dispel magic. Blindsense to 40 ft.  (SPELL THIEVES, ROGUES, NINJA) Equipped w/ Poison vs. Wisdom(or Charisma) 

The folly of greed: A PC picks up a well displayed valuable item. PC must make a will save DC 30) to let go. Item deals 1d4 wisdom damage per round until victim’s wisdom score is reduced to 0, the will save succeeds, or the victim’s hand is removed.

Folly of pride: Allow PC’s two routes of escape, one apparently very difficult, and one very simple. The difficult route requires PC’s to make consistently difficult checks DC 15-25 on climb, jump, swim, balance etc. The simple route begins very easily, allowing PC’s to easily pass the first several challenges (DC 5-7) and then ramping up difficulty greatly DC (15-20) until the DC’s of the checks are impossible to accomplish. Add unending stream of difficult monsters to force progression. Backtracking requires the PC’s to risk more combat.

Scrying Familiar: An invisible familiar stalks the party through a dungeon, allowing a sorcerer to trigger traps at precisely the right moment. (At end of dungeon, PC’s find the sorcerer, who escapes, leaving a cursed item as a ‘prize’)

One way out: The PC’s become trapped in a room. The only way out is to spring an obvious and deadly trap. Upon being sprung, the trap behaves differently than expected. After the trap is resolved the players are left with a dangerous escape route.

Folly of haste: The PC’s fight through a dungeon to the final chamber, where they find a powerful object shielded by magic. The only obvious way to unlock the treasure is to press a single button. Unfortunately for the PC’s, this will activate the trap unless a puzzle from early in the dungeon is solved.

Folly of Curiosity: PC’s making their way through a dungeon continually find switches that when activated cause a deep rumbling (Listen DC 25) but only appear to open small doors to minimal treasures. Once they reach the halfway point, the players must work through a subterranean mirror of the previous dungeon, where each switch they triggered has freed an exotic magical beast. 

Mind#@$&amp;: Players find an amulet that seems to bolster the abilities of a magic user. Upon equipping the amulet the character must make a Will Save (DC 30 +) To maintain control. Otherwise the DM takes control of the character uses them to send the party off track or to dangerous areas. Upon leaving the dungeon the amulet crumbles to dust. Benevolent DM’s may allow regular will saves from the character to regain control, or spot/sense motive checks from the party to notice the character is acting strangely.

Did I fuck up?",panjialang,75,18,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/11k91j/i_guest_dms_a_group_of_players_that_like_power/,"Title pretty much says it all.  We were also playing in the Dark Sun setting, which is supposed to be tough and unforgiving.  Each player also had 4 characters made in the event of death.  No one had died so far and this had been an ongoing campaign for months.

I took over because the DM was getting bored and wanted to try playing inside his own world.  I had been a player up to this point in his game and was familiar enough with the world and setting to feel like I could take over for a few rounds.

The DM was a great storyteller, but I felt that he has too giving and I had a feeling that we would always ""win"" no matter what we tried.  I should say to be fair that I did have a lot of fun playing this game under this DM, and everyone else too seemed to be enjoying themselves.

I was given the reigns by the DM, and this was known and accepted by all.  I told everyone about my style and kind of got the ""bring it on"" from the group.

When the game started I right away tried throwing them into the gauntlet, and they just acted like they could bat everything away with ease.  They had to cross a desert with no food but not once in my opinion really but on their ""thinking hats"" but just assumed everything would work out for them.  They also use (IMHO) cheap tactics and exploits to maximize their characters in battle, so to compensate I threw really tough monsters at them, which they didn't like.  (I'm unfamiliar with Pathfinder as a 2nd ed. player so I couldn't compete with them on their level)

The story goes they reached a city that was undergoing a revolt.  There was a massive encampment of soliders outside the city.  They cowboyed right up to the leader and attacked him.  I begrudgling fudged the dice and let them win because I sensed if I didn't they would get pissy.

Finally they retreated back through the desert and two of them were killed by a monster.  I forget the name of the monster but it disguises itself as an Oasis and then eats you.  One of them failed the check and was swallowed up and died.  Another went cowboy and tried to save his friend alone, also died.  This is the guy who shouted ""fuck you"" at me.

All in all I'm not a very experienced DM.  I know the main objective is that the players have fun, and that a DM should expect the players to do things differently from what he had planned.  But I also know there is such a thing as bad players.

What do you think, r/Dnd?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the advice.  I needed to communicate better with my players, and be more creative and fair with the ways I dished out punishment.

Also I should've mentioned that the player who attacked the leader of the encampment was the previous DM. He's also a pretty aggressive person, so I caved to him. I probably should've mentioned this in the OP, that the previous DM was trying to control ""my"" game as a player.",,False,,t5_2r9ei,1350394896.0,,,True,t3_11k91j,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/11k91j/i_guest_dms_a_group_of_players_that_like_power/,

To combat that I've made a list of magic items to give away, most of which are completely different than ones in the book, though some are close. I've aranged them in levels, and will roll a D3 and add it to the monsters level to decide what level, and pick a random one of those to be their prize. Some are pretty much useless, and I'd love to see what sort of things they can figure out to do with them.

To begin:

**Level 1** *in my system, only possible with a level 0 monster and a bad die roll, so they're kinda junk*

1. Top of Unending - *Never stops spinning unless touched*

2. Tongue Ring of Slobberiness - *You drool a lot and it leaves a hole if you take it out*

3. Ring of High Comedy - *All jokes made by character in game are perceived as funny even if they sucked*

4. Ring of Voice Diversion - *All speech is funneled out through the ring, but is otherwise the same*

5. Boots of Cleanliness - *Cannot, under any circumstance, get dirty*

6. Topsquirety's Trousers - *Trousers act like a liquid when touched, but stick together when lying on the ground*

**Level 2** *Still semi pointless, given by 1^st level monsters on a lousy roll, so yeah*

1. Butter knife of +4 Accuracy *+4  to hit, but does 1 damage only, and I doubt many people are proficient in butter knife*

2. Earrings of Triple Hair Growth - *Must wear both to work, grows at 3 times normal rate*

3. Robe of Itchiness - *Not cursed, but that would be funny*

4. Ring of Breeze Control - *Light breezes only, obviously, up to say ~8 mph*

5. Ring of Shocking - *Deals no damage, sort of like a joy buzzer, but it shocks on any touch, is a bit startling.*

6. Potion of Loudness - *Footsteps are also louder, along with your voice*

**Level 3** *in which the items become slightly useful*

1. Bag of Coldness - *Like a fridge! Holds about as much as a grocery bag*

2. Potion of Sourness - *Works like sweet water, but instead of purifying water, it just tastes like lemon juice*

3. Encyclopedia of Useless Knowledge and Poor Ideas - *Unlimited charges!*

4. Potion of Bowel  Freeness - *Causes one to defecate their trousers. Makes a nice poison.*

5. Stone of Unusual Heaviness - *200lbs and about the size of your fist. Not cursed, I hope*

6. Philter of Filtering - *Mostly for the name, it removes any particles from a liquid up to the size of a swimming pool*

**Level 4** *And so begins with useful items*

1. Bag of Song - *Filled with d10+5 charges, picks a song at random and sings it while open, stops singing if bag is closed or song ends*

2. Telescoping Short Sword - *Can be just a hilt, dagger length, or full short sword*

3. Box of Featherfall - *50lb weight limit*

4. Magic Lock - *NO KEY! Once locked does not open. Resistant to all but the toughest of brute force, though spells work as usual*

5. Wand of Gravity - *2 times gravity on items or monsters who have difficulty standing and can't really jump, but can still fight okay-ish. D6+3 charges*

6. Ball of Bouncing - *Big enough to sit on, once bounced all energy goes into momentum, so it gives off no heat and make no sounds, and keeps bouncing unless someone stops it*

**Level 5** *Last one for today! Sorry!*

1. Gauntlets of Perceived Strength - *Looks to everyone like you have +3 to strength, but you don't*

2. Pebbles of Shaking - *Shake the room when thrown on the ground*

3. Ring of Calmness - *Makes one more chill whilst it is worn*

4. Potion of Highly Concentrated Alcohol - *Like 250 proof. I know that too much alcohol can kill you, but this is magic alcohol so it doesn't.*

5. Blessed Acorn - *When planted and watered, grows to maturity in 2 minutes, dies 1 hour, and crumples into dust by 6 hours, all seeds of this tree are normal acorns*

6. Lute of Pleasing - *You cannot strike an off chord, though the song could be mediocre*


This is all I have as of now, but higher level items will come later. If you have any ideas I'd love to add them, any balance issues or tips are appreciated. I mostly want to see what players do with this so if you want to use this in your campaign, the only requirement is to tell me what the players do with them. Hope you like it :D

Because we were all completely new to this, things were very generic 'I use dragon breath for 10 damage'...'can I use initiative?' railroaded and not so exciting type of game play. We also made quite a few mistakes and were having to constantly check the rulebook, so it became quite tedious at times. 

I went to 8 or so, 6 hour sessions with this group and I really enjoyed it! But had to leave them when I went to university. I've since joined the Tabletop gaming society and uni and been placed into one of the 5 D&amp;D groups we have running on campus. I'm with 5 other people this time and our DM is very good at not railroading us and at making the story interesting. Only problem is, everyone in the group has been playing quite a lot longer than me and they're literally AMAZING at getting into character and at acting. I'm quite shy and I quickly get left behind during these games because of this. (I'm playing a Gritaur Druid this time around, but all my skills are in Beast form) 

I was wondering, is acting something you pick up the more you play? and does anyone have any tips on getting into character/acting? I was thinking about joining some online sessions over skype to get used to it a little, as I think this'll help a lot. I think things will get a lot more enjoyable if I'm completely in character like the others, but whenever it comes to a NPC asking me a question, it tends to catch me off guard and I don't know what my character would say or how to act it out.

I'm playing as a 18 WIS Chaotic-Good priest in AD&amp;D. Here's the catch: I'm a noob and I'm young IRL.


There have been a few riddles or situations that have arisen in game that a wise man would be able to deal with, but I, as the player, do not.

(For example: my priest is struggling with the fact that he can't save everyone he meets. His first encounter was with a group of Kobalds, which he tried to convert to his diety. He was shot in the back by an archer. I'm thinking if he were actually played as an 18 WIS, he would have known not to try. I, as the player, didn't.) 

He's supposed to be an incredibly wise idealist, but he's coming off as naive at best, plain stupid at worst.

I can try to sound smart, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm not wise and I still don't quite understand the world of D&amp;D as a whole.

What do I do?

How would I rationalize this in the game?

The Psion of the party insisted on purchasing a pig to carry around (because the figure he uses has a pig under his arm since its a random farmer character).

Well the whisper gnome rogue likes to play jokes on the druid (the druid likes to metagame and underplay the reduced intelligence, trying to convince everyone to subdue crazy druids that told them to get out when he insisted they stay to try and ""fix"" the druids, etc.). One such joke is the whisper gnome will take the druids headband off during rest (yes making sleight of hand checks, etc.) and put it on the party's pack camels or on the pig.

My question is assuming the pig normally has a 1 intelligence, the headband then makes it intelligence 3, which is *human* intelligence according to the PHB, so what would this pig be able to do with its new found intelligence?

Well, in that thread I mentioned I would be stepping down as DM to allow another to run his Eberron based campaign (3.5e).

The problem is, we're only one session in and he has already:

a) Attempted to railroad us to hell and back, going so far as to offer level 1 character 50,00 gold and a small army to do a quest (which we all turned down on principle; we were in a prison and escaping seemed more in character).

b) given us each a mgical item which is ridiculously over powered. For example, my rogue received a shortsword dealing 1d8 damage and a 17-20/x3 crit range. :/ Now, I know everyone loves to have the infinty-plus-one sword, but all of the party  would rather earn our rewards than be handed god-weapons to quickly slaughter hordes of enemies with.


This is not the first campaign he has run, and not the first time he has done the exact same thing. You could hear the frustration and rage building with each step of us dismantling his railroad. We have pointed out how ridiculous the items are, and how rigged his storylines have been in the past, but this is entering the the Elemental Plane of Bullshit.

It's not that I have a problem with the other editions. In fact, I think they all have their advantages and disadvantages. While 4th seems to be great for newer players, the learning curve is a little too low for me, and there's something lost in having things extremely streamlined. 3, 3.5, and 4 all seem to be a lot faster paced than the AD&amp;D games in terms of leveling and combat. 

As a DM, sometimes it is difficult to advance the story while the players are at lower levels, and as such, I tend to try and spend more time on actual roleplaying and giving experience for that to balance out the slower leveling in 2nd.

Come and post them and your stories of their usage here, be they cool combos which provide a practical benefit, or just an unnecessarily flashy way to do some mundane task.

For extra creativity, add in some that you can think of using the Wild Cantrips from the Dark Sun Campaign Setting, p.81.

I'll start us off:

1. ~~Use Light on the eye of an enemy to blind them.~~ **EDIT:** I've had it pointed out to me that since an eye isn't an object is almost 100% cases, this won't work. Alternatively, case it on their helmet or something near their eyes to cause a distracting light near their eyes.

2. Setting off a trap using Mage Hand.

3. Use Mage Hand to lift a skull in a dark cave and float it up in front of an enemy's face, use Light to make it glow, use Ghost Sound to say ""Boo!"", or another scary sound, then dismiss the Light.

4. Use Prestidigitation to hide the taste of poison in wine when you need to poison somebody.

5. Know that asshole at the bar who you'd really like to beat the hell out of, but don't want to get caught up with the law? Piss in a cup, then use Prestidigitation to change the colour and flavour and cool it down, and have the bartender serve it to the guy. When he's about halfway through a large gulp, then dismiss all three Prestidigitations. Now he's drinking piss.

6. Use Light to make a sneaky enemy's armour glow and make him easy to spot.

7. Make your tough-as-nails Fighter smell strongly like bubblegum just as he walks into a bar full of rowdy mercenaries.

8. Use Mage Hand to high-five yourself when your party leaves you hanging.

9. Use Object Projection (Wild Talent cantrip) after pickpocketing somebody to teleport whatever you took to a small chest hidden in a nearby house. If you get apprehended or accused, let them search you. They won't find a thing on you.

10. Got a target in a bar you need to take out? Give them a tankard of over-proof rum Prestidigitationed to look and taste like regular ale. Give it 10 minutes before they pass out and maybe die of alcohol poisoning.

11. Stuck out in the wilderness with nothing but a little bit of water? Just Prestidigitation it a few times to make it seem like beautiful, hot tea.

12. Use Mage Hand to untie ropes that are tying you up.

What is your best story of an unruly PC that you played with (as a fellow PC or DM.) And how did you deal with it? 

Mine is from one of my first times DMing. I hade DMd only a few sessions before I started a new campaign. I had 4 PCs, One friend who is a D&amp;D Veteran, one who was new to D&amp;D (we started playing a few months before), my wife who was also new, and another friend who was BRAND NEW.

So, my Brand New friend who was playing the ranger had of course heard of D&amp;D adventures from his other friends. Now, the friends in our group who play D&amp;D tend to be a bit more mellow. We have fun, but we really enjoy RPing, and just sinking in to the story. The Ranger, however, has another group of friends who are all about over the top crazy things (like a rogue in his other group sharing a story of bluffing gravity to not fall down a hole.) Now, remember, this is the Ranger's first time playing D&amp;D, all he had heard were stories from his other friends about it.

So, now that the long intro is behind us the story begins!

The group was composed of;
Paladin - Lawful Good
Fighter - Neutral
Wizard - Good
Ranger - Neutral.

Now, this is where my annoyance with alignment comes in. Lazy players roll neutral and take it as a ""I can do what I want, when I want, how I want and not care about the outcome because I am neutral."" Which was the ranger's mindset. The campaign had been rolling for about 5 sessions by this point. The Ranger did nothing but mess with townsfolk, and basically be a munchkin in combat. Since the only combat player tend to see in D&amp;D is combat they're meant to win he grew a chip on his shoulder. He decided to go to the inn, get drunk, grope a barmaid, then pee in the corner. He kept doing things like this and I tried jailing him, fining him, even having guards accost him! All he did was insult the guards and think he was amazing.

It was clear the other PCs were angry with him, because I could see it at the table, and all three of them came to me about him. I finally decided to take action!

I had a guard escort him out of town, and shut the gate behind him in the middle of a storm. I think had a goblin sneak up, steal his coin purse, stab him, and knock him to under 0 HP from full in one hit. The goblin then planted a letter on him. I gave him a -11 to his death saving throw since he was lying in a puddle drowning so he was sure to die in 3 turns. However, luckily for him, the Paladin was returning from a hut down the road from the village, found him, and healed him (I knew this would happen and that the Ranger wouldn't actually die.) The Ranger awoke, and found the letter in his pocket. I handed him a note card as we do in our group for Secret Information, it read;

""As a player you can do anything you want in D&amp;D. You are welcome to do whatever you want, and have fun so long as it doesn't ruin it for other players or turn in to you torturing the NPCs for no reason. Remember, the difference between you and the DM is the DM can also do whatever he wants with no restrictions, and by fudging the numbers.""

He learned after that session that he was more than welcome to do crazy things, just not so in-your-face, and annoying and became a great addition to our group!

So, fellow D&amp;D players, share your story!",,False,,t5_2r9ei,False,,,True,t3_1ee65x,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1ee65x/share_your_stories_of_unruly_pcs/,

Being under the impression she was not into dnd at all I simply explained what it would take to make a character and how things kinda work, figured it wouldn't come up again. Later that night we lost our healer in combat. Half-jokingly I texted my gf saying we were in need of a healer (let me be honest, I wanted her to play but didn't want to force her into it). She seemed to like the idea of playing a healer, so I ask if she was ready to take the plunge and should I send her the player handbooks. She responded as follows ""Baby I'd plunge into the depths of Moria to kill a balrog for you. I think I can handle being a D&amp;D healer. Of course I want the books""

The other session, I had this ritual I needed to complete to destroy an artifact (a demi-plane crafted by a God of Folly to break reality and escape a prophesied War of the Gods).  The ritual required the sacrifice of 36 souls.  So, I went to a city jail to get prisoners sentenced for execution.  The jailer wanted a bribe; not knowing how to really handle bribes, I just told the jailer to pick a number, I'm a high-level cleric and I work for a god.  He picks an exorbitant number, 5,000 gp per head or something like that.  So, I Miracle-request the required gold... in copper.  Because I thought the jailer was being a dick, so I figured a little playful dickery would be due.  

God gave it... flooding the room with a sudden flood of copper coins, killing almost everyone in the room.  Our monk survived because of some feat that lets him ignore spell damage on a successful Reflex save, and a few of our members (thankfully, including another cleric) weren't in the area at the time.

**tl;dr I accidentally killed half my party in a random act of comedic dickery.**

Oh, and I recently learned I can Miracle magic items into existence.  Costs a bunch of experience, but it's possible.  To deal with the influx of horrible artifacts of destruction in this game, I asked the gods for a Staff of Mordenkainen's Disjunction.

* Hate change

When you ate one, you got the potion type, but you also got a side effect from drinking it.**


Here's what we used:  

Welcome brave ones to the Unknown Potion Challenge! Have you come across a bottled liquid you have no idea what’s inside? Well this guide will help you figure out exactly what that liquid is. Who knows, it could be a potion of lesser restoration or just plain ol’ honey mixed with cat pee!   
          When you come across a potion that you are unfamiliar with, there are normally two actions you could possibly take: drink a little bit and hope for the best, or luckily you can roll a check to see if you recognize what it is. Normally, if you chose to drink it you just rolled and hoped for the best. Now, each flavor of the Harry Potter Bertie Bott’s flavored jelly beans will represent a potion/curse/poison.
If you choose to do a roll to see if you know what the potion is, then you are no fun and you don’t need this guide at all. If you are brave and stupid, the steps are simple:


1) If you choose to do a taste test, the group must decide who the unfortunate soul of consumption is.  
2) They will close their eyes and randomly pick one from the potion bottle.  
3) Once they figure out what the taste is, they will notify their DM.  
4) ???  
5) Accept your fate and your new potion (at this time, the DM will inform he consumer of what they had just consumed and what happens next)!  


Now, this is optional, but you can make each potion have an adverse side effect. For example, if you were to taste an elixir of fire breath, you would have bad indigestion, as well as temporary fire breath ability. Because you only partially tasted the elixir (and as such didn’t consume it correctly), you would have -1d2 constitution, and 1d4 fire breath damage (as an added feature, you can’t open your mouth without a flame burst, so you can’t talk, eat, or drink for as long as the DM deems so. Of course you can leave this out, but come on… real heroes will bite the arrowhead and take the side effects. The next page will have what are commonly used flavors and what they represent. Good hunting travelers!  
                                                                             Signed,  
                                                                             Alchemist Stejada Shifastian  
_______________________________________________________________________________________  
  
 NOTES FOR DM:  
You can choose which flavors represent which beans, and you can also choose to make the adverse side effects non-existent or as brutal as you’d like. In our D&amp;D campaign, we first rolled to see if we could identify the potion. If we couldn’t we rolled to see who would drink the potion. The lowest roll would then roll again for a dexterity check. The worse they rolled, the worse the side effect was, and so on and so forth. Their level can also affect the duration of the spell. Also, please note that I a winging the side effects, I see that they are very harsh, but I’m too lazy to go back and change it. Do as you see fit master (for example, one campaign my friend took a potion of flying, but when he got hit, he would fly across the room for 2 rounds [possibly hitting objects and us]. So you can willfully and creatively make your own side effects.). Also the side effects are only when the person is taste testing. Once the potion is revealed, the consumer will not receive any side effects.   
For example, this is the chart that we had used. Each flavor will represent how long the product will last, what it did, and what the general side effects were (keep in mind that you can change this however you would like:

I thought you guys might want to do something similar, either at the beginning of your campaign or part way through, like me.


I've got a short list here that you guys should fill out.  As a bonus, it's worth a good amount of XP to anyone who completes it.  Also, the more backstory you have, the more spotlights and interesting things I can do with your character, which will make things more fun for you.

Hint: Characters with backstory are the only ones that can get magic items that fit their backstory/character development.

Hint 2:  You can answer with more/longer answers.  I'll read every word, and try to use all of it when it's appropriate.

Hint 3:  Some/All of this can be secret from the other players if you want.  Just don't reply all if you want it to be secret.

Hint 4: Bonus points if your character has a dramatic secret that they haven't revealed to the rest of the party yet.

You're sitting around a tavern after a hard day's adventuring, and a braggart from the next table won't stop going on about how he one killed three goblins with his bare hands.  You're a little drunk, so stand up to top his story with your best accomplishment (pre-campaign).  What do you say?

1.

Oh god, now you've gone and made him mad.  Quick, think of a self-deprecating story to tell him about some time you've failed - perhaps with dire consequences?

2.

Well, at least that made him laugh.  But he still seems intent on strangling you to death.  Quick, better think of someone you know that would want to help you if they were here.  Actually you'd better think of a few, because this is a pretty big guy.  What are their names, and what they're like?  How do you know them?

3a.
3b.
3c.

And you really hope that other guy doesn't show up, because he'd probably help this guy kill you.  What was his name again?  What did you even do to piss him off so badly?

4.
4b?

They'd never have treated you this way in your hometown of (5.) Then again, maybe they would have.

After all, you left (5.) to do (6.)

But that was only a short term goal.  Really, you're in this whole adventuring game for (7.)

Your group will need to elect a Dungeon Master (DM) to run the game. The DM does not control a character, but controls the plot and plays the monsters and NPC's. This job requires a decent head for numbers, a bit of patience, and quite a bit of creativity. It's easily the hardest job at the table, but I find that it can also be the most rewarding. They will be responsible for upholding the rules, and controlling NPC's, and telling the story.

You will also need to select an edition. 4th edition and Pathfinder are recommended for new players, as they both have excellent starter kits (see below). For more information, see the resource guide for [Choosing an Edition](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/wjio3/resource_guide_choosing_an_edition/).

---

**4th edition (4e)** is current edition, and that is primarily what you will see in game and book stores. If you have not played before, I would strongly recommend picking up the [""Red Box"" DnD Starter Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Fantasy-Roleplaying-Game/dp/0786956291/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341679883&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dungeons+and+dragons+starter+set). At ~$20, it's a great intro the game. It comes with simplified rules, pre-made characters, some dice, and a pre-written adventure to give you a good taste of how the game works.

The core rulebooks (Players Handbook, Monster Manual, Dungeon Master's Guide) cost $30 each. Once you've played the starter kit, the core rulebooks have everything you need to create your own characters and write your own adventures.

The [DnD Encounters](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Event.aspx?x=dnd/4new/event/dndencounters) event series is an ongoing public campaign. It is an excellent introduction to DnD, it's free, and you don't need to make a character beforehand. Check the link to find a game near you, and go check it out.

WotC recently published some [free quickstart rules and adventures](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1k9kwp/free_4ednd_quick_start_rules_and_adventure_pdfs/).

**3.5** is the previous edition. Originally 3.0, the 3.5 update fixed a lot of broken things in the original system. Essentially no one plays plain 3.0 anymore. 3.5 requires a lot more math than 4e, but can also allow for much more flexibility. It has a bit of a learning curve, and many players find that there is an unfair power gap between spellcasters and non-spellcasters. I play this edition primarily, and many players try it after having played 4th edition for a while. Some change, and some don't; it's entirely personal preference. The core rules of the game available for free under the Open Gaming License, and can be found on the [d20 SRD](http://www.d20srd.org/). 

Should you choose to play this edition, your group will need a Player's Handbook, a Monster Manual, and a Dungeon Master's guide. However, these books are currently out of print so you will likely need to get them on ebay or in a used books store.

WotC is running a brief [reprinting of the 3.5 source books](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20120625)

**Pathfinder (3.75)** is published by a third-party company called Paizo. It is a rules overhaul for 3.5 which addressed several major paint-points in the original game. It is a very popular ruleset, and Paizo produces a lot of great content for it. Because it is based on the Open Gaming License content, all of the rules are available for free on the [Pathfinder SRD](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/). Pathfinder also has a [""Beginner Box""](http://www.amazon.com/Paizo-Publishing-PZO-1119-Pathfinder/dp/1601253729/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341724405&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=pathfinder+starter) similar to the 4th edition starter kit. It is somewhat more expensive at ~$35, but it is a very well reviewed product and a great introduction to the game. It also includes a ""choose your own adventure"" style single-player adventure which can give you a good intro to the rules without needing a full game group.

Should you choose to play this edition, you will need the [Pathfinder Core Rulebook](http://www.amazon.com/Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Core-Rulebook/dp/1601251505/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341724337&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pathfinder) and the [Bestiary](http://www.amazon.com/Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary/dp/1601251831/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341724367&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=pathfinder+bestiary). These can be found in gaming stores and book stores right alongside Dungeons and Dragons rulebooks and other role playing game books.

The full rules are also freely available from Paizo's [Pathfinder SRD](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/).

**Legacy Editions (AD&amp;D/2nd ed)** are still played by a handful of players who have been part of the hobby far longer than I have. These systems certainly have their flaws, but they are quite fun to play. Unlike later editions that utilise a battle-mat to show the environment and combat, these editions use the a ""Theatre of the Mind"" approach, in that the players themselves create the world in their minds, this can allow for a different type of role playing that some find more immersive. Due to the age of these editions the PHB/MM/DMG can sometimes be hard to come by and it is suggested that the players attempt to look on places like EBay or get a copy of OSRIC (Old School Reference &amp; Index Compilation). AD&amp;D had a huge influence on video game RPG's, and layed the groundwork for essentially every modern roleplaying game.

Note: WotC are running a brief reprint of the 1E material in the month of July (2012)

I don't really want to restrict a wizard all that much because I don't want to underpower it, but letting fighters ( for example) get powerful magic items  in an attempt to bring them up to the wizard's level doesn't work very well either. 

The problem is that it isn't fun for some of the party members when 3 of them are monks, fighters, and rouges, and the other one is the wizard who just blows everything up or summons  out the wazoo. 

  

  
  There are some other classes like this too, wizards, druids, clerics, sorcerers, but less so, and they tend to be pretty popular, so I don't want to ban them, but I'm really struggling with how to balance it. 
  

  The thing I've had the most success with is a combination of making the enemy NPCs prepare for wizard, directing more powerful items to the more martial players, and trying to make somethings that a wizard just can't do. 

The problem is that wizards can pretty much do anything. They don't need to disarm the trap because they can just use ethereal jaunt and float through it, or they can just teleport out of a situation if they do feel threatened, ect.
  
  I feel like wizards/clerics/druids are kind of game breaking, and I can't figure out a way to fix it.

The players had only the class to go on but no idea if it was good or not. They ended up with Isa a Deva druid who was 2 million years old and only turned into dinosaurs, Riven a revenant hexblade who had no idea he was dead, Kynek a paladin kenku who is super kind and helpful to anyone and Xune a knight who was repulsive but thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world.

The plot was an evil wizard made a tower to protect a grand treasure and every time people tried to climb it the challenges they faced were entirely different. The only constant is that you needed four members and there was an inn nearby for people to LFG. The characters group up and after some hilarious character interaction they moved on to the tower itself.

The first challange was a relatively simple ten foot climb to the door which was locked but had four hand sized holes in the wall that they had to put their hands into and a needle stabbed them and then opened the door. Then a room with a load of empty boxes and chests to distract them.

They did panic when they entered a room and were immediately got crit by an attack that dazed them all and a roar came from a huge dragon that had obviously just assaulted their mind. There was worry and the first guy on initiative blew a daily and as soon as it hit the dragon illusion faded away.

After various challenges that were everything from a flooding room to a fight against two fire elementals in room full of ember moss they made it to what would effectively be the final boss room. There was a winding path around the room covered in ice that also went outside the tower at two points. Riven went off himself and the other three decided to go together. Riven got across pretty easy but about halfway Isa slipped and fell which pulled Kyrek down and in turn Xune so that all three of them where hanging by Xune's finger tips. Isa dropped to let Xune pull Kyrek up. Due to quick thinking Isa turned into a pterodactyl to serve as a parachute effect she just survived the fall and quickly found a load of switches that when turned on lit up the floor and started to heat the room. With the melted ice and a pretty simple climb back up it was a simple matter for everyone to assemble at the door.

Now the fun begins. Everyone started to bicker and Isa tried to blow everyone back into the room. At this point every turn anyone in the room had to start rolling endurance other wise start cooking in their armour. Riven managed to stay up but Kyrek and Xune fell down to the ground. Finally they all got into the corridor and kept fighting with Xune almost going down to Riven (including Riven using Mists of Madness to make Kyrek almost make the final blow) but then with Xune 1 damage away from death Riven critical failed and ended up killing himself.
