I've made a list of all the stuff that came to mind when I decided to start doing tutorials for all the little things I know about, and here's the result.

There's not that much right now, but mainly that's because they cover quite a few topics in themselves and **this is by no means all I'm going to do**. I've got a lot more coming after this and I'll be trying to update this as often as I can with more of the stuff I've come up with.

I'm going to break this up into sections for what areas of FL Studio the tutorials pertain to to make things a bit easier to navigate for all of you. The tutorials themselves are of varying difficulty and technical level, so they're not in order from easiest to hardest or anything like that.

And PLEASE, **if you have any questions or recommendations for things for me to go over, let me know!** I'd be happy to do some of the stuff I know you all have questions about. This is just stuff that I thought of and I promise you there's gotta be some smaller stuff that's slipped my mind.

If anybody else would like to tell me or somebody else some tips they know of, don't be afraid to do that either. You don't have to make whole tutorials like I have, either. :P

*Also, I'm sorry about any drops in quality for some of these tutorials. They're pretty big in filesize. You'll have to try to ignore it unless I decide to split them up into parts or something.*

Getting that out of the way, I think the voting is disheartening, and I'd just like to maybe influence the way people are looking at this subreddit.  A lot of well made tracks are getting lots of votes and comments, and power to those dudes.  They could post to musicmakers and other subreddits after that, knowing they have a positive sympathetic reception.  They can go on and get some people paying attention to their work.  The problem is all the shitty tracks.

Frankly, there's some pretty bad music that gets posted here.  Not terrible but the lack of experience shows, the mixing isn't there, the composition might be cliche, the production in general is just...off.  We should be upvoting THAT stuff.  We should be commenting on that like crazy.  Those posts deserve lots of attention, those are the guys that need help.  They're doing a good thing by bringing their music to the attention of more experienced producers, we should all try to help.  Offer constructive criticism and teach them how to better accomplish their goals.

1357163257.0,35,self.FL_Studio,15ujsa,Hey FL studio warriors! Let's hear your top 5 interface tips. (xpost of selfpost @ WATMM),qp0n,41,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/15ujsa/hey_fl_studio_warriors_lets_hear_your_top_5/,"I'm just an average joe mediocre independent producer but I love FL and have an intermediate level of experience with it. But I still often &amp; regularly get the feeling I am doing things inefficiently and there has to be an easier way than way I am doing... so I am always discovering &amp; looking for new tips &amp; tricks within the madness that is the FL interface. Referring mainly to the little things that save time, keep you from making mistakes, or creative ways to achieve an effect.... whatever falls in the ""wish I knew that earlier"" category.

Naturally, I'll start off:

1) Holding shift when sliding a point in an automation clip will keep it from moving vertically. Finding this out even one project too late is frustrating enough to warrant mention. I have full-on OCD when it comes to my automation clips and having a level be even 1-2% off can be disastrous for FMsynth and tempo clips. The moment I accidentally learned this I instantly dropped a few points off my blood pressure. (which reminds me - took me a bit before realizing you can right-click and set an automation clip for the tempo. Makes easy tempo shifts and can result in some pretty cool effects)

2) The pattern selector in the step sequencer has a ""split by channel"" option which will split the channels of a pattern into their own separate distinct patterns, so you can create a sound all in one pattern then split them later.

3) Pretty common knowledge but ... the ""make unique"" option in the dropdown menu for patterns and automation clips - use it and use it often.

4) Most effects and generators have a ""store in separate state"" option which makes FL studio remember your current custom settings, letting you explore different ideas/presets, then easily revert back to the stored state.

5) ctrl+z undoes, but also redoes your last action ... whereas ctrl+ALT+z will progressively undo recent actions (up to 20 I think). I'm sure this probably isn't - nor should it be - commonly unknown, especially for anyone that uses photoshop... but I think it's too crucial a tool and if even one person wasn't aware of it then it is list-worthy.

and, as I think of it, here's a bonus #6 ... though another one I'm sure 99% of you already know;

6) Inverted linking is one of my favorite tools and If you are unfamiliar with it then I highly recommend it for a ""Send"" track in your mixer for every project - basically just turns any two tracks into an automatic turntable fader - Right click a volume slider in the mixer, ""link to object"", find a mixing effect to link to (I usually just create a peak controller for a track I want to invert), then switch the drop menu to ""invert"" and adjust the formula to customize. Great for adding in random samples to break up repetition.

Bonus Tip: immediately rename new patterns to numbers, and separate different pattern types (perc, strings, bass, etc) by tiers of 10 or maybe even 100 to leave room for each unique pattern. This not only makes it easier to identify what kind of pattern each clip is, but when zooming in/out and using short clips the squished title will still read the first character of the pattern name.

Really though I'm most interested in hearing others' tips. There's too much in FLstudio to discover on my own and every small trick directly converts to minutes of sleep.

I've been using FL Studio since version 6 religiously. I'm well versed in many different DAW's such as Pro-Tools, Logic and i'm somewhat familiar with Ableton Live.  I have my degree in audio production, I'm a professional sound designer and music producer. I have released various electronic songs with some success.  I'm posting this because a friend of mine has been urging me to start doing tutorials. So with that being said I'd like to open it up to you all by allowing you to request tutorials. I'll try to keep them short, and concise. What every you like- drum programming, fx processing, synthesis - what ever. I'll be doing the tutorials in FL Studio but I'll definitely try to make them translatable to all the different DAW's available out there.  So let me know what you would like, and I will be more than happy to help you all out. :)

There are a ton of secrets in FL that you find out with sheer coincidence.

- For instance,  if you go in Sytrus and click the ""?"" and then click the lemon it says ""ouch!"" and some mean messages in the top left text bar.

- If you type ""fuck you"" into ""Find"" under the file browser an error message pops up that says ""Fuck you too!""

- If you have fruity dance open, the anime figure will appear on the samples you drag into your playlist. As well, it will also appear in the FL Studio ""about""

- If you constantly click on the FL Studio fruit in the top left corner it comes up with a bunch of messages like ""Stop clicking the fruity :D""

- Some of the effects plugins play a little wave graphic when you mute them, such as the FL limiter.

These are some shortcuts that really speed things up for me:

(I'm on FL10 but I can't imagine they changed any of this)  

  

In the playlist I mostly keep it on the Paintbrush Tool, so that given:  

-Holding Alt in most situations disables snap to grid, no matter what other keys you hold.  
-Hold Ctrl and the Paintbrush becomes the Selector.  
-Holding Ctrl+Shift while clicking will add or subtract to your selection clip by clip.  
-Holding Shift then dragging with the left mouse button duplicates the selection. (Useful more often than Ctrl+B because everything stays relative to the grid)  
-Holding down the left mouse button and double-clicking the right mouse button will mute/unmute a clip.  

-Holding shift while using the Slice tool will make it so you don't have to drag the stupid thing down through the clip.  

-Ctrl+L will assign a Channel to the next free mixer track.  
-Shift+Ctrl+L for multiple Channels all in a row.  
-Double-click the ""fx"" number window in the Channel Settings to go straight to that track in the Mixer. (Without accidentally dragging it to the wrong track... fnsonofabitch..)  

That's all I got off the top. Which ones are you guys into? Add to the list, just don't copy and paste from the help file or whatever. I hope all your music is going great!

Hey guys! I'm working on a skin for FL Studio 11 since I couldn't find any I liked. Some questions:

- Should I release this so others can use this? If so, where should I post this so that people can find it?

- Should I also skin the playlist/step seq/mixer etc, or will that be too much?

Some tips for getting a better mix.

Give yourself lots of headroom on all your sounds. The loudest sound in the mix is the usually the kickdrum and it should be no louder then -8DB

Pay attention to overlapping frequencies in the bass area of your track. The low frequencies from all your sounds (even if you can't hear them) will add together and compete with your kick and bassline. EQ can be used to cut out these unwanted low frequencies.

Use automation and panning but don't overdo it. Panning is helpful when layering high end sounds or giving space to percussive elements that hit on the same beat.

Eliminate 20 hertz (Deepest Lowend) even from subbass to get a cleaner sound. 20 hertz is inaudible but will still make the speaker move.

Kick and bassline more noticeable and clash less. High end is crisper.

Mastering
Mastering is the final stage where effects are used only on the master channel. The main purpose of mastering is to boost the perceived Loudness of the track through brickwall limiting and multiband compression. Other processes are also used in attempt to issues with a poor mix. Mastering is an essential process but it can only do so much, bad mixing can not be corrected through mastering.
A recommended plug-in for mastering would be lzotope Ozone

Composition and Originality
Is your track interesting, catchy, or unique? Are you using overplayed samples or chord progressions? Some of this is obvious, some of this is subjective to the listener.
Make sure you have the correct song structure, if you need guidance just drag one of your favourite songs into your DAW. Mute it and match the tempo then use it as a guide for how your song should progress timing wise.",,False,,t5_2rig0,False,,,True,t3_18e5zf,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/18e5zf/some_tips_for_getting_a_better_mix/,

I also thought that Abelton’s piano roll was clunky and did not have anywhere near as many features as FL Studio’s piano roll. Well that’s my two cents worth about trying out Abelton.

Create a large catalog of unique sounding tracks.
Diversify, play with electro-house/classical/dnb/progressive/experimental/glitch/dubstep and mix them all together so the story makes sense.
Make better sounds that put me at a professional level while keeping my unique twist on things.
Have fun and learn about music.

I'm open for tips on mixing/EQing and creating leads and Electro/Glitch basses. Any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks :D.

Pretty damn good collaborations from the people here. Now who's next?

Cross genres always have good turnouts as far as I'm concerned, so bring anything to the table.

Posting Links to a good song would probably be convenient. 

Version: FL 9, FL 10

Major VSTi available: Nexus 2, Massive, FM8, Gladiator, Purity, among a few others.

There is very little discussion going on about how to use the program and different ways to accomplish different things, and instead what we've basically got is a show-and-tell of people's first attempts at writing music. FL Studio has some amazing capabilities, but they're not being showcased in this subreddit.

Edit:
I dont mean to hate on people, but the vast majority of posts i see in the subreddit are [listen] posts to people's early (read: not good) experimentation with the software, which on the whole makes the software look like it only makes bad music. If instead we focused discussion on how to use fl studio, and allowed posting of clips to instead say how to i transform this specific sound into a better sound (notice i said clips, and sound, not song) then this subreddit would actually facilitate people getting better at using the software, rather than serving as a vacuum for people to dump tracks into",,False,,t5_2rig0,1345162208.0,,,True,t3_yav1e,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/yav1e/should_we_really_be_submitting_as_many_songs_as/,

Previously, I had only used the panning tools given and I always felt as if my beats were still ""dry"" even after EQ'ing and mixing. I feel like the stereo separation really creates a more full effect and everyone should be aware of that. Note, I am not a master at mixing or err... mastering, so I may be completely wrong, but it is definitely working for me as of now. Anyways, go out and experiment, I hope I helped a little!!

I'm also glad to see people being very creative and having fun on the journey of music production.
 
As a result, I see a ton of ""[Listen]...gimme feedback"" posts in this subreddit. This is by no means a bad thing. It's great to have a place where we can all get together and show off our work. However, I feel like most of the submitters in this forum could be receiving much more useful feedback than the few comments that manage to trickle in on their tracks. Also, I feel the community that is being asked to listen to these tracks could gain more enjoyment if they were given specific things to look for and comment on in [Listen] threads.

So, how can we get better feedback?

* Ask *specific* questions. Don't ask a general, vague, opinion based question, unless you want general, vague answers. Instead of ""What do you think about my track?"" say ""How can I write a better transition between the melody and the verse?""

* Ask the *right* questions. People tend to be quick to please, and slow to criticize. If you ask ""Does it make sense?"", you most likely get a simple yes! as a response. Try asking ""How would I write the melody in order to accomplish X goal?""

* If you are submitting WIP's, please put that in the title and be specific about what we are looking for. Remember, we cannot write the rest of the song for you, we can only help you along the way.

* ""If nothing bad is ever said, nothing good will ever be done."" Point: Open yourself and your post up to all angles of feedback, positive and negative. This is best accomplished by following the above points. When you receive negative criticism, don't shut that person down. Ask for an explanation, you may learn something about your music you did not know!

That is all really I have for now. Feel free to add more suggestions. Please understand this is not a rant!

Hi, FL_Studio! My name is Sean, and I've been working in FL since Fruityloops 2. This was the last song I did in FL10. I'm now working on wrapping my full length up using a rewired FL11 and Cubase 5.

I own a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (had an E-MU 1616m, but when I upped my mobo I didn't realize I no longer had PCI slots, only PCIe. I learned a very valuable lesson) which I used to record my DI guitar tracks, which were then run through Line 6's Pod Farm and Soundgoodizer.

The drums are completely programmed. The samples I use are random ones I've collected over time, some of them being blended to create a unique sample. In this project, I used the FPC to load all of the samples of a given piece, adjusted the velocity trigger sliders to their appropriate places for each sample, and then set the FPC to trigger randomly while never hitting the sample just used. Each piece has its own FPC while being set to trigger on note C5 for easy sequencer use. Each FPC channel was assigned to its own mixer insert and adjusted accordingly.

[http://i.imgur.com/VT4EM8y.png](http://i.imgur.com/VT4EM8y.png)

The reason I did this instead of using one single FPC was that, at least to my knowledge, there is no way to individually give each pad in an FPC its own mixer insert. I needed to be able to individually EQ and adjust whatever else for each piece of the drumkit. If there is a way to do that, please let me know.

While this setup is immensely easier for me to write in, going back to do the entire full length in one project file (to set things up for rewired use in Cubase and appease my drummer with his, ""No fill can ever be the same,"" mindset), I went back and changed all of the FPC trigger notes, starting with C5 and descending. I then threw all of my FPC's into a layer to be able to use a single piano roll for the entire drumkit, similar to how it would work if everything was in a single channel. The only downside to this is that the keys aren't labeled in the piano roll. They simply say C5, C#5, and so on. I guess it's not THAT big of a deal considering you can use the pencil tool and hear each time you place a note, but it's something worth noting.

I'm open to all MIXING, SET UP, and other SIMILAR criticisms, suggestions, and ideas. As far as criticism on the music itself, keep it to yourself please.",,False,,t5_2rig0,False,,,True,t3_1fikf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/1fikf2/listen_posthardcoremetalcore_song_done_completely/,

1358089151.0,15,self.FL_Studio,16hqsz,[TIP] Apply effects to separate frequencies of an EQ. ,ninjao,20,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/16hqsz/tip_apply_effects_to_separate_frequencies_of_an_eq/,"* You need 3 mixer channels with an EQ in each. 

* Set each channel EQ frequency (1, 2 &amp; 3) to LOW - MIDS - HIGHS, respectively. 

* Load a VST, Instrument or Vocals into a 4th channel and route it's output into the first 3 that you created.
* Be sure to disable channel 4's output into your master.

This allows you to apply individual effects for different EQ Ranges. For example you could add distortion only to the lows (bass) and have a mellow reverb on the mids and highs. 

The possibilities are endless with this and it leads to the creation of very unique sounds. 

It also really opens up the soundscape and adds a lot more quality to your productions. 

Can also be used for a really WTF effect with vocals.

What had held me up for so long was me being stuck on the price of the signature edition. $300 is a lot of money, and if you're not making music professionally it can be a difficult sum to justify. But I finally got proactive and started asking around and somebody told me I could just get Producer edition for a hundred bucks less and add in all the VSTs I want to use separately (he said the IL plugins aren't the best anyways). So then I went on Amazon and got Producer edition for $169! I'm pretty freaking excited to start making my noobtronic music for everybody to hear. 

What made me want to buy in the first place is when I saw that all future fl studio updates are free with purchase, and that's a pretty cool gesture.

When FL starts, it always loads the last template that was loaded, so what you do is make just the basics for a song, all nicely grouped and sorted into channels.

Also you can load the common FX on the channels that you will use.


Once you have everything set up, go to File - Save as Template.

Then navigate to the templates folder in your projects folder, and save it in the default directory.


Once you've done that, go to File - &gt; Templates, and load the template you just made.

Now if you quit FL and start it again, it will load that template always.

This means that when you load FL you can dive straight into making a song, without having to fiddle too much to find the sounds you want.

I usually mix my tracks with absolutely nothing on the master channel, just clean audio running through the different mixer channels and what not. I usually leave plenty of headroom for mastering, and I'm never opposed to lowering the actual volume of the master channel in order to stop it from being in the red.

But when I have a mastered track, supposedly ""done"", and play it and then play a professional track, the result is always the same. The professional track is always a lot louder. Now, I do know that measuring your self against something that has been treated by a professial mastering studio isn't the best of mindsets, but what are you gonna do right?

I have tried various methods, from layering compressors, limiting, and Ozone's maximizer, but I can't seem to get it right.

------

Ever since I graduated high school, I've been trying to music. At first, I was poking just around on a keyboard and trying to learn to play the guitar. I got a little better, and started writing instrumental songs. Just piano and bass with some strings. I did that for a couple of years. Then, I started recording guitar tracks. In 2008, I swallowed my fears and started to sing. Three albums later, well, here we are.

I don't really have much gear - just a single electric guitar, an acoustic, my amp, some pedals, and my computer. I do all my own recording, mixing, and production. Last night, I ordered my first (small) round of discs, and signed off on the digital distribution agreement for iTunes and whatnot. I'm still learning, but I'm quite proud of how far I've come. I would be thrilled if you took the time to listen. 

----

Standout tracks, according to those who have listened before (and me, of course) are:

[Poster Child](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/poster-child) - 80s rock with a huge beat.

[Girl's Got Altitude (Little Bit Higher)](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/girls-got-altitude-little-bit-higher) - Big guitars, soaring chorus.

[Going Down (Little Bit Deeper)](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/going-down-little-bit-deeper) - A grinding, gritty beat and a noisy solo.

[Indecent](http://ianmarquismusic.com/track/indecent) - An electronic track with as many synths as would fit.

* I can't record audio with a MIDI keyboard. As far as I understand it, I can record input into the piano roll, but the keyboard isn't really sending any sound. (I know that's obvious to everyone else, but it was  really a milestone for me).

1376622896.0,10,self.FL_Studio,1kgr8r,My band uses FL for everything except for drums and vocals. Here's how with a few questions regarding optimization.,StarMech,19,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/1kgr8r/my_band_uses_fl_for_everything_except_for_drums/,"My band recently had a core member quit and he took our van with him. We had a small tour coming up along with some other shows that we really didn't want to drop, so we had to come up with something quick. I bought a PreSonus FireStudio project and came up with this setup.

Using an FSP with FL is interesting, because the master insert is assigned to outputs 1 and 2, which are coupled with the master outputs, the difference being the master outputs are controlled by the volume knob on the front, while all other outputs just seem to be turned all the way up (I learned the hard way).

[FSP Outs](http://i.imgur.com/S44UGMs.png)

So why get something with so many ins and outs? We have 3 guitarists and a bassist plugging in, and wanted to run as many click tracks as possible. I'll ask the question I have regarding this at the end.

[Guitar Insert](http://i.imgur.com/C3QGmes.png)

Over in FL and going down the chain, I have Autotune slapped on at the start that automates on during certain leads to make sure harmonies are perfectly in tune between guitars. There are 2 PodFarm instances, one for distortion, one for clean, which are automated on and off (Now that I think about it, ""Link to Controller""-ing to the distortion automation with an inverse formula would be better than automating them individually. Another great reason for typing this out! :D). I have a Soundgoodizer on there which I'm sure some people will disagree with, but it really beefs the sound up and doesn't rape resources. Then follows a limiter, which is then followed by delay and reverb which are automated on and off as well, and an EQ.

Since we have 3 guitarists which is comprised of mostly 2 leads, a rhythm, and a bass, I have one lead panned hard left, one panned hard right, and the rhythm and bass in center, bussed to a ""Band"" insert. The guitars were mixed together, and I now have a nice slider I can easily adjust them to fit the rest of the project.

[Playlist](http://i.imgur.com/q6oEHwf.png)

We got the bounced files for synth and background vocals and harmonies from our producer. Dropped them into the project, and mixed them in with guitars. That completes everything the crowd is supposed to hear. Because there isn't an actual ""click track"" in FL, I went to an empty project, turned on the click, and recorded audio on the master insert. Using the beeps, I created 2 wavs. One for the high beep, and one for the low. We use the high beeps for count offs just to make sure no one gets lost. For example, there will be 8 low beeps, 4 high beeps to count off, and then we all come in on the next count.

[Click Setup](http://i.imgur.com/JKAabi5.png)

I grabbed an insert to be the click bus, removed from routing to the master insert, and assigned it a physical out.

Currently, the only person using a click is our drummer. We have two quarter inch cables running into a small mixer which he plugs his headphones into. Set that up, and then bussed whatever inserts he wanted to hear into his click and adjusted the volume to what he desired.

[Bus volume knob](http://i.imgur.com/vDdYwzF.png)

That's pretty much everything. When we set everything up, I use the master outputs to run to the stage snake so I can adjust how much volume I'm sending to the sound guy. Every system has required a different amount of juice so far. One benefit to this is the guitars and backing tracks are premixed. Sound guys always keep backtracks turned way down for some reason. With this setup, no backtracks means no guitars, and no sound guy is going to do that. If they do, people don't look at the band, they look at the sound guy and say, ""Why can't I hear their guitars?""

The questions are:
Is there anything I've overlooked that may increase performance? I generally have really high CPU usage until I hit tools &gt; macro &gt; smart disable. Is there any way I can have this happen automatically? I shouldn't have TOO much of an issue. Specs are quad core 3.5 GHz i7 and 32 gigs of RAM on Win7 x64 (which makes me hate FL for being a 32bit program).

Is there ANY way to take single stereo channel and turn it into dual mono? If I currently plug headphones into output 4, for example, I will only hear audio in my right ear. Is there any sort of converter I can get that will replicate that into both ears? This current setup allows for 3 click mixes, which isn't enough for my entire band to move to personalized click tracks. If I can have each individual out as a separate mix, I'll have WAY more than enough. I understand there is no way to set FL to have mono outputs, but if I can convert one side of a stereo channel to dual mono, I can create to panned clicks and send them to a stereo out to be converted into dual mono.

The wobbling can be done with LFOs, peak controllers, slide notes within the piano roll (using the note cutoff). ",,False,,t5_2rig0,False,,,True,t3_qoaus,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/qoaus/so_i_accidentally_figured_out_a_popular_dubstep/,

Seriously, in the next version of FL, they NEED to change it from a the whole percentage thing, to giving it an actual value. I don't know how they'd do it, but it really needs to be figured out imo.

So how do you guys handle automation clips? Is it just a matter of fiddling with the percentage until you finally find the value you're looking for? Or is there some kind of a trick you can use to find the EXACT value you want?

One of the reason I haven't used very many wobble sounds is because switch the speed of the wobble is just a pain in the ass. If you don't get it exactly at 1/4 or 1/12 or whatever speed you're looking for, it just doesn't match up right.....and with the whole percentage system? No way. I usually end up making copies of the same sound and just setting each one at a preset speed.

Here's my set-up when I make dubstep-tracks!
Mixer set-up:
Kick
Kick (Layer)
Snare
Snare (Layer)
Clap
Hat (Closed)
Hat (Open)
Ride
Crash
Drums WET
Drums DRY
Sub
Bass
Bass
Lead
Lead
FX
FX
Distortion (Send 1)
Reverb (Send 2)

I've put an EQ on every track. I've routed all the drums to Drums WET and Drums DRY. Drums WET and DRY are for parallell compression. So I've put an EQ and a compressor on them. I've routed the bass-channels to Distortion and Reverb. And Lead and FX to Reverb. Also put up some empty samplers for the drums, which are linked to the mixer. I've also set up Layer for Kicks and Snares &amp; Claps. 

Hope you enjoy it! :)

In the mixer you will also find a sidechain track, which is routed to the bass bus. You should use this to help your drums get more space in the song (you can also route it to the leads of course.). Also, there are some neat colors in the mixer.

On the main mixer, you will find Maximus, a limiter and 2 EQ2's. The EQ's has been set to cut the 20Hz and 18k Hz and the other is raising the higher frequencies for some crisp (this is of course optional). The Maximus is set to a default setting and the limiter is also default.

In the Step sequencer, you will find a bunch of empty samplers for your drums and a 3xosc, which is the basic sinewave in which i use as a sidechain signal, routed to the sidechain.

This will help me and hopefully, you as well! :)

Today I set out to create a somewhat expressive-sounding synth using only PoiZone (which I'm still getting the hang of).  I'm releasing the .flp of the entire 'song', which I completed with default all VSTs and samples I found in the installation - also default.

I did my best to organize it as nicely and most easy to understand as I could - here's a colour chart of the piano roll notes (if you open up a pattern you'll see)

- Green notes:  Lead
- Blue notes: Harmony
- Yellow notes: Chords
- Pink notes: Supporting / accent chords, in this .flp it's a sidechained progression

The pattern names and colours are pretty self-explanatory.

Hopefully this will help some people get a sound they're after, or learn a few things that they might not know about.

Here's a render of the song (not trying to make this a [Listen] post, sorry!)

The pattern at the top is obviously my kick. I'm using peak controllers on the kick for all my sidechains.

Whenever the kick drops out there is a noticeable gain in volume and lack of sidechain in all the sidechained channels. 

Is there any way I can work around this, to have those channels still sidechaing without the kick. I tried a muted kick routed to the same channel as the kick before realizing that the volume of the kick determines the sidechain, therefore muted kick = no sidechain. 


So does anyone know any solution? As I said before the sidechain is the peak controller method.

So, what I'm asking is, does anyone know a tutorial that explains WHAT everything is rather than just how to use it? I don't mind if it's text or a video.

This issue has been coming up more and more, so I'd like to address it personally.


Many /r/FL_Studio users have made comments for and against [Listen] posts in this sub, and I'd like to see if we can all agree to a compromise that would please everyone.

User Roastmasters made a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/yfv7j/can_we_please_ban_listen_posts_they_belong_to/c5vayn8) that I feel adequately explains my feelings on the presence of [Listen] posts in this sub. I'd like to keep the amount of content dictation as low as I can, to make sure everyone can submit what they want. And in keeping with that goal, I don't think fully removing or aggregating [Listen] posts in one thread will solve the problem nor improve /r/FL_Studio.

Additionally, another user, CocoSavege, made this [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/yav1e/should_we_really_be_submitting_as_many_songs_as/c5tw3hh) that I believe embodies the kinds of guidelines I'd like to see applied to [Listen] posts. I think this kind of submission policy will give [Listen] posts a new sense of value and encourage active discussion of tracks/subjects rather than idle replies. 

I'd like to add a condensed version of these guidelines to the sidebar, and begin enforcing this policy on the sub to try and cut-down on some of the more ""spammy"" [Listen] posts. But, of course I'd like to hear what everyone else thinks of this before changing anything. 

**TL;DR**: I'd like to keep the [Listen] posts around, but make sure they're submitted with the right info/context/goals to encourage quality conversation.

I have been out of the music software scene forever. The last Windows software I owned  was Cakewalk in the mid-90s. I have purchased a few things on my iPad, such as Garageband and played with them, but that's not really the same as what a computer program should be able to do.

I used to play keyboards, still own both an acoustic piano, an old Alesis Quadrasynth+piano, and have an old Mackie 1204 mixer. I played in a hobby cover band for a couple of years, just for fun.

My new interest in music software comes from my 13 year old son. He takes electric guitar lessons, and has been for about a year now. I started by thinking it would be great if he had something other than the basic drum machine that's built in his amp to practice with. Even better might be a rough version of the song he's working on with drums, bass, keys, but no lead guitar ('cause he's supposed to play that part).

So, I started reading about music programs, and I'm blown away by how far they've come. I guess I shouldn't be since it's been 18 years since I've really used anything in this category. I talked to the guys at the local music store, and for Windows, and they love and recommend Cubase. Cubase looks like capable software and likely their basic version would likely be all we'd need. My concern with them is, from what I've read, their aggressive copy protection policy can be a hassle (hardware dongle), and their upgrades seem expensive.

I came across FL Studio and it looks like a pretty good choice from what I've looked at. I also really appreciate the common-sense policy that would allow me to use the software on a second computer in my house. Also, the free-upgrade policy seems great. One question on this, do the plugins that come with the software (such as Sytrus, for example) get free upgrades as well? Some of these plugins seem expensive, if purchased on their own...and would make a free upgrade to the software not so free if they don't come along as well. What about purchased plugins? Do they upgrade for free, or is there an upgrade price for these when newer versions of either the plugin or FL Studio come out?

Unfortunately, most of the online sound demos, youtube videos, and such seem to be pretty heavy on the techno/house/dance music, which is really not my thing. Is FL Studio good for rock/pop music as well? What about the sounds that come with it? Would I need the Hardcore effects plugin to be able to do rock music?

1.  Is there a way to quantify (quantize) the ""edit events"" graphs?  Mine are always kind of smooth peaks and valleys and I would love to quantize/snap them to the grid in a more quantum way.

I use the Oxygen 25 Midi controller with FL Studio on a Windows Vista laptop. I've had the keyboard for about 1 year or so now and I'm starting to run into problems with it.


The keyboard will randomly stop working with FL Studio. The power remains on, but FL Studio will no longer accept any midi input from it. I've tried refreshing and enabling/disabling it in the FL settings, and shutting the keyboard off and on. The only fix I have is to exit FL Studio completely, unplug and replug the keyboard back in and then restart FL Studio. Which is a pain.


Has anyone had similar issues? I'm honestly not sure if it's FL acting up or just the keyboard. I haven't been able to pinpoint the cause of the problem, but it seems to occur more frequently after about 10 minutes of time or saving.

Does anyone have experience on making preset button configurations on MIDI's or on FL_Studio?  Any help is appreciated",,False,,t5_2rig0,False,,,True,t3_15u6jm,http://www.reddit.com/r/FL_Studio/comments/15u6jm/how_to_configure_a_new_midi_keyboard_into_fl/,

You can listen to the track here, the straight download link is also in the description of that.  There's 4 parts ('types' of arps) to it, which is why it'll sound disjointed.  Also, it's not designed to be an actual song, which is why there's no intro and no outro, and it's probably quite annoying.  It's all explained in the description on the Soundcloud page, though.

In the piano roll, the notes velocity is the default setting for the btm half of the window. Simply change this to channel pitch, and draw in pitch changes using the pencil.

So I thought I'd give a brief run down on them here and hopefully help out a few peeps.

If you look at any compressor, you will notice it works with a few sets of paramaters. Namely Threshold, Ratio, Gain, Attack, Release, and Type.

Threshold: This is the limit for when the compressor starts to compress. Anything under this limit is ignored. anything over it is compressed. The way you set this is to check on the mixer where your sample peaks it, and then set the compressor around there. Eg: Kick drum sample hits at -20db, set the compressor to -22 or around there, sample will be unaffected up to that point.

Ratio: Simply put, the ratio determines how much amplitude the sound needs to become louder. At a ratio of 2:1, the sample needs to increase by 2db for it to be 1db louder after compression. Most electronic music uses between 2:1 - 4:1 compression, 10:1 and above is refered to as limiting, and you can even have infinite:1 which is basically brickwall limiting.

Gain: This is the gain of the sound AFTER compression. Setting this sets the output level. Simple as that.

Attack/Release: This is the speed at which the compressor compresses, and the speed at which it releases the sound. It just gives you finer control.

Type: Generally this will be Hard or Soft, although some compressors give you more options. Hard compression is abrubt while Soft compression is more gentle and subtle. Hard works well for kicks, soft works well for strings/pads. Its all down to preference.

So when should you use a compressor? The first answer is only when you know you need it. Alot of people love throwing a compressor on everything. All this will do is reduce the dynamic range overall and make a wall of sound. And it never sounds good(It will be loud and in your face, but your ears will get tired quickly and you will end up not liking it)

Compressors can be used to give a kick drum thump and make it stand out over everything else, or it can be used to make something with a very wide dynamic range more controlled. The only way to figure it out though is to experiment. Its not as complicated as people think, although it is a very fine art indeed.

Hope this helped

So you can go into massive, nexus, reaktor, and touch and any nob you want, use the physical controller you want to controller with and bam, epicness. **Now**, I'd love to be able to use, for instance, my modulation wheel on on my Korg to control something like CUT and RES

I was thinking the best way to go about it is to post requests for an example in the comments below. And then people can reply with a link to an FLP and an explanation of whats going on.

As for the FLP's themselves, keep it simple and only use the default samples that load as well as only FL native vst's or FX and everyone will be able to load them. The only problem is people using older versions of FL. As many of us are using 9 or 10.

So i've got a friend who owns fruityloops since and we've got a bit of distance between us, we were wondering how we could maybe work on the program over the internet.

I know there used to be a Program called Collab, but they stopped supporting it.

So even if i was able to see his screen, hear him talk(over skype or something) AND hear the music we're playing, that'd work too.

We had a screen share and a audio chat going, but he wasnt able to get the music through to me.

We tried a program called JackAudio, but he kept getting an error:AVSetMmthreadcharacteristicserror: 1552

I think it has to do with him being on Windows7HomeEdition64-bit.

But yeah also his sound card isnt that powerful, so i was trying to find a program that would act as a sound device, route fruityloops to output to that, and then have him set that as his skype device and i'd be able to hear it. But no Success.

Anyone have any ideas? we spent about 4 hours on this lol. We're both pretty new to FruityLoops so we're trying to get our feet wet together.

Thanks!

EDIT:

So we figured it out.

Combination of 2 computers, both using Skype.(therefore 4 skype accounts, 2 for our voices, and 2 for the transfer of the audio, a program called Virtual Audio Cable, and also TeamViewer).

When I hit play on the bassline, I noticed that even though it sounded even, it was playing louder on one channel than on the other(by about 2db).

I had already made the sample mono, so it wasnt from that, must have been just the way the sample was(also it was 2 samples, not 1, routed to the same channel).

I did however find a solution very fast, panning it slightly to one side fixed the balance, but was not viable imo, but when I dropped the stereo separation down to 0 on the mixer channel, the bass was immediately perfectly mono, and really loud. it made a huge difference.

So next time you struggling with your bass, try reducing its stereo spread on the mixer channel. :)

3. Activate a resonator (the top one in this case) and drag the slider all the way to the right. Also increase the 
feedback after personal preferences. This will cause a warm bass sound.

4. Play with the other resonators; activate one or a few more and experiment with the feedback.

5. Be creative and do whatever crazy stuff you'd like to do!

I've recently picked up a USB-audio interface and am trying to compose on FL using a guitar, bass and a midi keyboard. I have been reading a fair bit of the F1 help but I'm still trying to get my head around the basics of the program, so that I can make a song with a few basic elements: electronic drum kit, bass, rhythm and lead guitar and keys. 

So my question is what is the relationship/difference between the 'channels' in patterns (i.e. kick, clap, snare) and the channels I see in the mixer such as insert 1, insert 2, send 1 etc. (incidentally what the fuck are these?)
 and tracks I can make in the playlist? Also why is there an option to have multiple playlists, doesn't this just complicate things? 

From what I understand a song I write basically looks like a playlist which is composed of a number of patterns, each of which has a number of different unique channels (hi-hat, whistle, piano etc). So in my composition process, should I be writing each instrument part on a separate pattern, then copy pasta'ing to separate tracks in the playlist (to make verses, choruses etc), considering I want to have some midi but also some actual audio (like .wav recording of me physically playing some chords or a lead part on guitar). Should I be including a bassline along in one pattern with the drums, or is it best to keep them all separate, considering that I will want to mix the lead guitar individually and put a delay or something on it, but not on the drums as a whole.

Sorry if these are very obvious questions, I'm basically trying to approach FL from a basic background in classical and guitar based music with a crude, limited understanding of audio engineering.

Well, just one. It seems like the sound needs to be activated before playing the full sound. Say, if a long reverb is played, I can hear every bit of a sound played. If the sound isn't activated (when it deactivates, I can hear a tiny little click, and some very vague noise completely dissappears.)

I've made a video to demonstrate - it's hard to explain, and even harder to google for solutions on this matter.
You can kind of see what I'm talking about on the limiter - if the previous sound hasn't stopped playing, the next full sound will be played. If the sound is 'off' the attack won't be played.

It's a minor difference (especially with the ghost notes from the other samples on) but I think it would improve my workflow. 

In fact, the whole pattern view is kind of silly now that I think about it. Maybe I should switch to Ableton?

However, I found that only after paying $200 dollars for an upgrade can I compile my synths as standalone VSTs.

Here's where I'm going with this/tl;dr:
I don't care about making standalone VST plugins. What I want to know is, can I save a synth I've made in Synthmaker as a preset or something so that I can open that synth back up in a seperate project?
And for that matter, can I save presets with Harmor as well?
The documentation was a little fuzzy in those areas for both.

2. Going from FL8 to FL10, I noticed the pattern blocks were removed and replaced with these tracks. I don't get what I'm suppose to do with these tracks. Is each track a grouping of a certain part of a song (ex: Bassline in track 1, synth in track 2, etc.

3. I've read a lot of tutorials and stuff and I noticed that a lot of them call for adding a certain sound to the mixer and cutting out the low/high frequencies. What exactly does this mean and how should I know when I've cut out enough of each respective frequency? What should I be looking for?

I've never really gotten round to mastering a track or even learning how to do it as I've never actually completed a single one of my projects in all the years I've been at this stuff. Never really even been concerned with cuttin unneeded freqs etc as I go along either as most of my stuff is unrefined ideas that I will someday return to.

I just started a new project today with the sole goal of finishing it before I do anything else, no matter how bad it turns out, I want to finish a damn track and atleast have the mixing / mastering down even if the melodies suck.

So, with this in mind, should I be disabling fruitly limiter from the master channel when I start my project? I've never really been bothered about it until now but am unsure if having it enabled now will somehow hinder me either as I go along or when it comes to the final mix.

All opinions / comments appreciated

Thanks in advance
