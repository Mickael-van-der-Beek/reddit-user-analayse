No. This is the playoffs. 

Save your goodwill towards men for either a) Christmas or b) the regular season. They are not our friends. We hate them until the series ends (and then maybe a little afterwards). Don't apologize to those Rag fans for our fellow Caps fans slamming the glass or complaining about the refs. 

Fuck the Rangers. Fuck their ""real"" fans. Fuck their shit ass stadium. Fuck them. See the hatred in the OTT-MTL series? It's good. Embrace it. It's the playoffs

Sorry for bitching.

So with game 7 just a few days away, I just wanted to say thank you guys for a great series so far. It all goes down to one game, and knowing our series so far... one goal... somewhere within 2 minutes before the end or overtime... BUT at least it'll be exciting. 

Whatever happens, the Caps have my respect - should it come to be, I'll gladly cheer for the Caps next round.

### Big story:

&gt; After the teams' game at the end of February, the Flyers held eighth place in the Eastern Conference and the Capitals were 14th. Heading into Sunday, Washington is 11th and Philadelphia is 14th, four points out of eighth. Each has 14 games remaining.

&gt;""It's kind of like a long extended playoff series here,"" Capitals forward Troy Brouwer said prior to playing Saturday. ""Every game that we play from now until I think six or seven games from now are all teams that we're fighting to try to get into the playoffs with.

&gt;""It's not even teams we're trying to catch. We're all battling amongst each other and it makes it tough because that means teams are getting points every night that we're trying to jockey with for position in the standings.""

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; A win would put Washington at .500 for the first time this season. The Capitals got their fourth road win in a row by scoring with 40 seconds left in the third period before defeating the Buffalo Sabres 4-3 in a shootout.

&gt;""This is a huge trip for us,"" defenseman Mike Green said. ""We've been playing well on the road lately and we need to continue that. As everyone knows, it's harder to win on the road, and these points are huge for us.""

&gt;Green scored the tying goal and had his first multipoint game since Jan. 25, his second since Oct. 22, 2011.

&gt;""That's what the leaders on your team do, and he did a great job of that,"" goalie Braden Holtby said of Green's goal. ""... You can tell when the game gets close to the end and the game is on the line, he wants [the puck]. He wants to be the guy, and that's a great characteristic to have as one of the leaders on your team.""

&gt;Game time is 6 p.m. after Saturday's 7 p.m. start with the Flyers having played at home Saturday at 1 p.m.

""Philly gets a little bit more rest than us, but, you know what, we needed the points, we got 'em; hopefully that gives you some confidence and we can turn it into a good start tomorrow,"" coach Adam Oates said.

**[Flyers](/r/flyers):**

&gt; Despite never winning more than two games in a row, and enduring a season-long four-game losing streak before a 3-1 win against the Boston Bruins, Philadelphia maintains an outside chance to reach the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

&gt;""It's been kind of a tough season for us, just a lot of ups and downs, and I think [Saturday] is a momentum builder for our team, and I think with the remaining games, we just keep playing like that, and who knows?"" forward Matt Read said.

&gt;""We've just got to keep winning and try and make a playoff run, but we've got to put this game behind us, and we have another important one tomorrow against Washington.""

&gt;The Flyers added defenseman Kent Huskins in a trade with the Detroit Red Wings on Saturday, but it sounded like rookie Oliver Lauridsen would remain in the lineup after his performance Saturday. Lauridsen played several shifts against the Bruins' top line and perhaps could find himself matched against Alexander Ovechkin.

&gt;""When a young player comes in you want to watch and see how he's doing in his first game, and as the game progressed, he was fine,"" Flyers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""He did a good job defensively and that's a tough line to play against (Saturday).""


### Players To Watch:

&gt;Ovechkin, who had 10 shots on goal Saturday, has eight goals and 13 points in the past nine games. … The Flyers power play is 5-for-5 over the past four games and has moved to the top of the NHL (32-for-129, 24.8 percent). Forward Zac Rinaldo was credited with 12 hits in 12:41 of ice time on Saturday. ""Give me 18, I'll give you 20,"" he said.

### Big story:

&gt;   This is a true rivalry now -- the Capitals and Rangers will be meeting in the postseason for the fourth time in the past five years. The Rangers won in seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals last season. Washington needed five games to eliminate New York in the 2011 conference quarterfinals. The Capitals came back from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Rangers in seven games in the 2009 conference quarterfinals.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;As hot as the Rangers were in April, the Capitals were better. Washington went 11-1-1 and is 15-2-2 dating to March 21.

&gt;Alex Ovechkin had 20 goals and 32 points in the last 19 games of the regular season. Nicklas Backstrom had 24 points over the same span, and goalie Braden Holtby went 9-1-0 with a .937 save percentage and 2.16 goals-against average in April. He has a 1.77 GAA and .935 save percentage in 12 career games, including the postseason, against the Rangers.

&gt;Washington is dealing with an injury situation as well. Joel Ward (bruised left knee) has been out since April 7. He is back at practice but has not been skating on any of the top four lines. However, Ward hopes he can play Thursday and coach Adam Oates said there was a good chance he will as long as he can handle any lingering discomfort.

&gt;Brooks Laich (sports hernia surgery) is out and likely won't be back for this series.

**[Rangers](/r/newyorkrangers):**

&gt; New York went 10-3-1 in April to clinch a playoff berth. The Rangers' offense came around as they scored 51 goals (3.64 per game), while their defense remained stout, allowing 27 goals (1.92 per game).

&gt; Derek Stepan and Henrik Lundqvist are two of the biggest reasons the Rangers made the playoffs.

&gt; Stepan finished April with 19 points in 14 games to earn the NHL's Third Star of the Month. It was the most productive month in his three-season career, topping the 15 points he put up in March.

&gt; Lundqvist started and finished all 14 games in April and posted a .934 save percentage and 1.76 goals-against average. It was his best month since January 2012.

&gt; The Rangers, though, might have to start the playoffs without Ryane Clowe (undisclosed injury) and Brian Boyle (knee). Neither player practiced in the days leading up to Game 1.

&gt; ""Injuries are part of it,"" Rangers coach John Tortorella said. ""We have people in spots that haven't been there, but it gives them an opportunity, so that's how we go about it. There's no sense in worrying about it, it's just finding people to make big plays in those situations and get big minutes in those situations to help your team win.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Stepan has been leading the Rangers, but don't discount the play of Brad Richards, who had 16 points in April after totaling 18 points in the first two-and-a-half months of the season. Ryan Callahan had 16 points last month and Rick Nash had 14. … It's been all about Ovechkin for the Capitals, but Backstrom has produced, and Mike Green has 19 points in the past 19 games, including seven in the past four.

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** Tom Poti (back), Brooks Laich(groin)
* **Rangers:**  Ryan Clowe (undisclosed), and Brian Boyle (knee)

Both the Caps and Jets have played 45 games, with the Caps having 52 pts, and the Jets 49.  The Jets play on 4/22, a day before we play them (our next game). Assuming the Jets win on 4/22, the standings will then be Caps (45 gms, 52 pts) and Jets (46 gms, 51 pts). If we win in regulation the following day vs the Jets, it becomes Caps (46 gms, 54 pts) and Jets (47 gms, 51 pts). The Jets would be behind by 3 pts with one game left to play!

### Big story:

&gt;   The Capitals can clinch the Southeast Division and the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference if they defeat the Jets in regulation or overtime. On the flip side, this is the season for the Jets. If they win, they'll have 53 points and jump ahead of the Capitals into first place in the Southeast (though Washington will have a game in hand). A regulation loss would not only eliminate the Jets from the division race, but could also end their hopes of making the top eight in the East playoff race.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;  The Capitals no longer need any help from anyone. After a 2-8-1 start that dropped them to the bottom of the division, the Capitals have grabbed first place with a 9-1-0 stretch. They won eight in a row before starting a two-game road trip with a 3-1 loss to the Ottawa Senators, but bounced back with a 5-1 victory against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday.

&gt; A win in regulation or overtime will give them the division title and the third seed in the East. A regulation loss would mean Washington would likely need to win its last two games to move past the Jets.

&gt; ""There's still three games in the season,"" center Mike Ribeiro told the Washington Times. ""Obviously [this is] a big game for both sides, and for us you beat them, you're in. But you need to take that like, 'OK, it's not the end of the world,' either.""

**[Jets](/r/winnipegjets):**

&gt; Winnipeg's final road trip of the regular season got off to a successful start when the Jets edged the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 on Monday night. Antti Miettinen's goal with 7:36 left in regulation broke a 1-1 tie. Aaron Gagnon also scored for the Jets, and Ondrej Pavelec made 24 saves.

&gt; But make no mistake - the Jets know what's at stake when they take the ice Tuesday night.

&gt; ""I think it's been circled on our calendar for a long time now,"" Jets captain Andrew Ladd said. ""We wanted to put ourselves in a position where tomorrow's going to be a meaningful game, and we've done that. So here it is.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Ladd was the NHL's First Star of the Week. He has 10 points in his past five games. Goaltender Ondrej Pavelec is 6-0-1 in his past seven games. … Alex Ovechkin has fueled Washington's surge. He leads the NHL in goals with 30, including two on Saturday, and has four goals and seven points in his past four games. Ribeiro has a goal and eight assists during a five-game points streak.

But every year something new happens in hockey. That's what's great about the playoffs. Look at the West right now; four teams that have never won the Cup will be fighting for a spot in the final.

### Big story:

&gt;  The New York Rangers found their offense on Monday by gaining possession and going hard to the net. After scoring one goal in the first two games, they beat the Washington Capitals, 4-3, in Game 3 to pull within 2-1 in the best-of-7 series. The difference was again special teams, but it flipped on Washington. The Capitals had been strong on the power play and dominant on the penalty kill, but the Rangers were much better on the power play and were perfect on the PK in Game 3. Marc Staal returned to the Rangers' lineup after missing 29 games with an eye injury.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Coach Adam Oates gave his team Tuesday off, allowing them to rest after they were on the wrong end of a physical, emotional, up-and-down Game 3. They were originally scheduled to practice at Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., but Oates nixed that after the game Monday.

&gt;""At this time of the year, I'm not worried about conditioning, it's more fatigue and getting better prepared mentally,"" Oates said. ""So we'll take [Tuesday] off and recharge the battery.""

&gt;The Capitals had a chance to at least force overtime in Game 3 when they went on the power play with 1:54 left in the third period. They turned it into a 6-on-4 when Braden Holtby was pulled for the extra skater (Joel Ward) with roughly 90 seconds left. However, Nicklas Backstrom had a pair of shots blocked and Washington never put one on goal.

&gt;Washington's power play was 0-for-3 in Game 3 after going 2-for-7 over the first two games in the series.

&gt;""They did a good job of getting in the lanes,"" defenseman Mike Green said. ""They were very committed at the end there. It wasn't going to be a cute goal. It was just going to be a throw it on goal and bang it in. We were on the perimeter and we didn't get a chance.""

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt; They got goals from four different players in Game 3 (Brian Boyle, Derick Brassard, Arron Asham and Derek Stepan) because they went to the net to create their chances. The Rangers also kept the puck alive by activating their defensemen and telling them to be aggressive on the blue line.

&gt;Asham and Stepan scored in the third period because Ryan McDonagh and John Moore, respectively, were able to keep the puck in at the left point.

&gt;""That was a huge difference in the outcome of the game, at least for us,"" McDonagh said. ""We didn't sit back and be passive, wait to see what they are going to do. We want to try to make a difference. Their defensemen have been getting involved in their offense, and we need to do our part offensively on our back end.""

&gt;It goes unnoticed at times, but Henrik Lundqvist was another big reason why the Rangers won, particularly for how he played in the second half of the second period. Yes he was beaten by Mike Green for a game-tying goal at the 17:17 mark, but Lundqvist made several point-blank saves while the Capitals were pushing and owning time of possession during 5-on-5 play.

&gt;""You always feel a little bit better after a win, but it's the first to four and I'm already thinking about [Wednesday],"" Lundqvist said on Tuesday. ""What happened [Monday] is gone and you start over.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Brassard chipped in with a goal and two assists in Game 3. Boyle was effective not only with his physicality, but he scored a goal, had an assist and won 14 of 21 faceoffs. Green has scored in back-to-back games for Washington.

### Big story:

&gt; These teams are level at 31 points, and the one that doesn't claim two more in this contest could be pushed to 14th place in the Eastern Conference by the end of Saturday night.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington did everything it needed to by winning the final three games of its most recent road trip to squirm back into the Stanley Cup Playoff race. The schedule also set up perfectly for a postseason push: The Capitals play seven straight games against clubs outside the top eight in the East.

&gt;Well, the Capitals started this stretch with a 3-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Tuesday night after yielding a late goal to John Tavares. The prior time Washington lost to New York, it was just after a hot streak and triggered a three-game skid that nearly ended any hope of a sixth straight playoff berth.

&gt;This is the first of three road games in four nights, and the Capitals probably need four points to keep their fleeting hopes alive. Any fewer than that, and general manager George McPhee might be forced to consider trading Mike Ribeiro, who will be an unrestricted free agent in July.

**[Sabres](/r/sabres):**

&gt; Lindy Ruff was fired after a 6-10-1 start, and though the Sabres haven't been winning a lot more for interim coach Ron Rolston, they have been collecting more points. Rolston's record sits at 7-6-4, and those extra non-regulation losses are the reason Buffalo still has scant postseason aspirations.

&gt;Buffalo's schedule isn't nearly as favorable as Washington's in the coming days. After this contest, the Sabres play six straight against teams currently in the top seven in the conference. Including this game, seven of the next nine are at home, but the Sabres are going to need to knock off teams well ahead of them in the standings to not be out of the playoff race in two weeks.


### Players To Watch:

&gt;Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin has seven goals and 12 points in the past eight games. … Sabres forward Tyler Ennis has two goals and five points in his past five contests.

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** John Erskine (upper body), Tomas Kundratek(lower body),  Tom Poti (back), Eric Fehr (undisclosed)
* **Sabres:**  Alexander Sulzer (knee), Thomas Vanek (upper body)

It's been seven games and only three points to show for it, but remember there are still around 40 games to played. 

The team has shown some signs of picking it up recently, and I think that the team is on the right track to start playing good games. 

If Ovechkin, Backstrom, and Green play like they know they can play, that would add to the force that this team has. With Ribeiro and Ward playing very efficiently, and Wolski (great signing) showing he can score additional goals, this team can move up the standings. 

On goaltending, that will improve.

### Big story:

&gt;  The series shifts to Madison Square Garden with the Capitals leading 2-0 after Mike Green hammered in a 55-foot one-timer for the overtime winner Saturday in Game 2 at Verizon Center. The Capitals have limited the Rangers to one goal, which went off of John Erskine's skate. Washington has won the special teams’ battle with two power-play goals and a perfect penalty kill, which is 7-for-7. The Rangers could possibly get two more guys back in the lineup Monday as both Ryane Clowe (undisclosed) and Marc Staal (eye) are getting closer to playing.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Coach Adam Oates gave his team a partial off-day Sunday, making their practice in Arlington, Va. optional. The Capitals earned it with two strong efforts at Verizon Center to give themselves a 2-0 cushion in the series.

&gt;""It's nice whenever you have an optional,"" Capitals forward Jay Beagle said. ""If guys feel like they need some rest, they can ride the bike, get a stretch in or if you need to get out there and get a little skate in, it's good. It's good for the guy. Everyone, just individually, does what they need to do to be ready for [Monday].""

&gt;Everyone already knew the Capitals’ power play could be dangerous. It was first in the NHL at 26.3 percent during the regular season. But Washington has put on a penalty-killing clinic over the first two games after finishing the regular season 27th in the League on the PK.

&gt;The Capitals have been aggressive on the puck and have forced the Rangers into poor decisions resulting in either clears or shorthanded chances the other way.

&gt;The PK actually became a strength late in the season, when it went 28-for-33 over the final 12 games.

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt; After scoring 51 goals over 14 games in April, the Rangers are once again struggling to find offense in the playoffs. Their lone goal went in off an opponent's skate. They didn't sustain any kind of pressure in Game 2 Saturday and went the final 17:43 of the game, including all eight minutes in overtime, without a shot on goal.

&gt;""I don't think we should overthink this,"" Mats Zuccarello said Sunday. ""I think we should go back to how we play at the end of the season, getting pucks deep, getting in on our forecheck. That's when we're at our best and creating offense.""

&gt;The Rangers' biggest problem in the series has been on the power play. They are 0-for-7 with 10 shots on goal. The Capitals have also blocked 13 shots when the Rangers have been on the power play.

&gt;""We definitely gotta get more shots on our power play, get some more traffic in front of him,"" captain Ryan Callahan said. ""If we do that, I think we'll be fine.""

&gt;Clowe said he isn't ruling out a return in Game 3. He has missed the past three games dating back to the end of the regular season with an undisclosed injury.

&gt;Staal, who hasn't played since being struck in the right eye by a deflected shot on March 5, did not speak to the media Sunday, but his status likely remains the same. He said earlier in the series that he has to feel comfortable that he can play his normal game despite some blurred vision out of his injured eye before he returns.

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Capitals goalie Braden Holtby has a .983 save percentage and 0.47 goals-against average through the first two games. Holtby has allowed one goal on 60 shots. Alex Ovechkin and Green each have a goal and an assist in the series.

### Big story:

&gt;   After falling behind in the first period the Washington Capitals rallied for three straight goals against the sputtering Rangers.  The Rangers made a surge in the third but with a miraculous save Holtby kept the two goal lead in place to finish the game 3-1 for the Capitals.  With the second game in tow the Rangers look to even the series and take home ice advantage.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;As hot as the Rangers were in April, the Capitals were better. Washington went 11-1-1 and is 15-2-2 dating to March 21.

&gt;Alex Ovechkin had 20 goals and 32 points in the last 19 games of the regular season. Nicklas Backstrom had 24 points over the same span, and goalie Braden Holtby went 9-1-0 with a .937 save percentage and 2.16 goals-against average in April. He has a 1.77 GAA and .935 save percentage in 12 career games, including the postseason, against the Rangers.

&gt;Washington is dealing with an injury situation as well. Joel Ward (bruised left knee) has been out since April 7. He is back at practice but has not been skating on any of the top four lines. However, Ward hopes he can play Thursday and coach Adam Oates said there was a good chance he will as long as he can handle any lingering discomfort.

&gt;Brooks Laich (sports hernia surgery) is out and likely won't be back for this series.

**[Rangers](/r/newyorkrangers):**

&gt; New York went 10-3-1 in April to clinch a playoff berth. The Rangers' offense came around as they scored 51 goals (3.64 per game), while their defense remained stout, allowing 27 goals (1.92 per game).

&gt; Derek Stepan and Henrik Lundqvist are two of the biggest reasons the Rangers made the playoffs.

&gt; Stepan finished April with 19 points in 14 games to earn the NHL's Third Star of the Month. It was the most productive month in his three-season career, topping the 15 points he put up in March.

&gt; Lundqvist started and finished all 14 games in April and posted a .934 save percentage and 1.76 goals-against average. It was his best month since January 2012.

&gt; The Rangers, though, might have to start the playoffs without Ryane Clowe (undisclosed injury) and Brian Boyle (knee). Neither player practiced in the days leading up to Game 1.

&gt; ""Injuries are part of it,"" Rangers coach John Tortorella said. ""We have people in spots that haven't been there, but it gives them an opportunity, so that's how we go about it. There's no sense in worrying about it, it's just finding people to make big plays in those situations and get big minutes in those situations to help your team win.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Stepan has been leading the Rangers, but don't discount the play of Brad Richards, who had 16 points in April after totaling 18 points in the first two-and-a-half months of the season. Ryan Callahan had 16 points last month and Rick Nash had 14. … It's been all about Ovechkin for the Capitals, but Backstrom has produced, and Mike Green has 19 points in the past 19 games, including seven in the past four. (And don't forget to watch out for Matty P's celebrations).

### Big story:

&gt; With the possibility seeming more realistic each day that it will take winning the Southeast for one of these teams to make the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Capitals and Hurricanes each begin play Tuesday four points behind the Jets for first place in the division. Carolina holds three games in hand on Winnipeg, and Washington two.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; There are still 13 games remaining to be played for Washington to overcome its rough start, but the Capitals didn't do themselves any favors Sunday night in a disheartening loss to the Flyers. They led 4-2 in the third period after power-play goals 26 seconds apart by Marcus Johansson and Alex Ovechkin, but yielded a Claude Giroux power-play goal with 6:12 left, the tying score to Kimmo Timonen with 9.5 seconds remaining and the winner by Ruslan Fedotenko 1:34 into overtime to suffer a 5-4 defeat.

**[Hurricanes](/r/canes):**

&gt; Veteran goalie Dan Ellis was activated from injured reserve Monday and would seem likely to get the start despite Peters' unblemished performance in his prior outing against Washington. Things haven't gone as well for Peters since he had to come on in the final minute of a March 21 game against New Jersey when Ellis suffered a laceration to his leg. He's lost three of four starts, including Monday's 4-1 defeat in Montreal, in which Jordan Staal opened the scoring but not much went right for Carolina after that. The Hurricanes have now lost eight of nine.""


### Players To Watch:

&gt; Ovechkin has eight goals and four assists during an eight-game points streak for the Capitals. Nicklas Backstrom has three goals and four assists in the past six games. Mike Green has goals in consecutive games. Troy Brouwer has a goal and three assists during a three-game points streak.

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:**  Tom Poti (back), Eric Fehr (undisclosed)
* **Hurricanes:**    Tuomo Ruutu(groin), Bobby Sanguinetti (upper body), Justin Faulk (knee) , Cam Ward (knee)

### Big story:

&gt;  The rivalry resumes between these Southeast Division rivals Sunday night at Verizon Center, where the Capitals hope to continue their push towards a spot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Washington is 7-1-1 in its past nine games and has pulled even with the Winnipeg Jets at 40 points apiece atop the division. The Caps also have two games in hand on the Jets.

&gt;Tampa Bay, meanwhile, is on life support. The Lightning lost to the New York Islanders in regulation Saturday to fall eight points back for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Lightning, however, have two games in hand on the Islanders.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington possesses the best power play in the NHL. The Florida Panthers found that out the hard way Saturday.

&gt;Alex Ovechkin continued his torrid scoring pace with a hat trick and the Caps scored three times via the man advantage, then hung on for a 4-3 victory at the BB&amp;T Center. The Panthers tallied two quick strikes before the midway point in the third period before Tomas Kopecky scored in the final minute to give the Caps a scare.

&gt;In the end, though, the Caps got what they needed from Florida – two points in the standings.

&gt;“We play our way,” Ovechkin said. “When everybody gets into the play and everybody plays hard and plays simple, it’s going to work, especially with the kind of opportunities we had on the power play.”

**[Lightning](/r/tampabaylightning):**

&gt; Tampa Bay rallied erased a one-goal deficit twice Saturday, but Matt Martin broke a 2-2 tie with 6:26 remaining in regulation and the Lightning were unable to tie it for a third time in a 4-2 loss at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Richard Panik and Matt Carle scored for the Lightning, who lost for the first time in regulation since Jon Cooper replaced Guy Boucher as coach on March 25.

&gt;""We didn't do a good job of puck management,"" said Cooper, whose club turned the puck over 31 times against New York “We have to do a better job of that if we want to be successful.""


### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Green has five goals in Washington's past four games and now leads the League in even-strength goals by a defenseman with seven despite missing 13 games because of injury. … Tampa Bay's Shawn Matthias also has five goals in his past four games and has four more in 39 games (14) than he's had in any of his previous four NHL seasons with at least 50 games played.

For the first time in my Caps fandom I am not overwhelmed with a paralyzing sense of impending doom heading into a massive playoff game. I've spent a lot of time thinking about why and the bottom line is that I just can't complain about any part of the way the Caps have been playing. They have finally evolved to do all the little things we as Caps fans knew they had to do to win in the post-season. And they're not only doing it, they're doing it really freakin well. 

To a man, the Caps players have talked about how they never get too high and never get too low anymore. They know what to expect on a daily basis from Hunter. Truly we are seeing a team that was dying for an even-handed leader they could respect. Boudreau was too emotional and unaccomplished to fill that role. Ovie has the passion but no one has the skill to follow his example.

Hunter has put every guy in a position to succeed. From Alzner and Carlson bottling up the Rangers 5 on 5, to Chimera being shot from a cannon, to Knuble going hard to the net, to Hendricks flying all over the ice, to Aucoin being a self-described 'prick' every chance he gets, to Ovie being below the circle and actually gaining speed on the breakout, and to Joel Ward starting and closing out game 6 after what should have been the nail in the coffin. 

In a sport filled with so many passionate, talented players I really think it's the leaders that make the difference. Detroit always had theirs. Jersey always had Stevens (ugh). Now we finally have our guy.

Win or lose, I can't wait for the ride.  Let's do it!

### Big story:

&gt;  The home team is perfect in the series after the Washington Capitals' 2-1 overtime win in Game 5 Friday at Verizon Center. For the series to go back to Washington for Game 7 Monday, the New York Rangers have to take care of business on home ice. They have two wins and eight goals in two games at Madison Square Garden this series, opposed to the two goals they've scored in three consecutive losses at Verizon Center. The Capitals are trying to advance to the Eastern Conference Semifinals for the third straight season.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Washington has been excellent at home in this series, with a 3-0 record and two goals allowed, but they're 0-2 at Madison Square Garden and have allowed eight goals.

&gt;The difference, according to coach Adam Oates, has been their starts. The Rangers jumped to a 2-0 lead in Game 4 and held a 2-1 lead early in the second period of Game 3. But it wasn't so much the score as it was the little mistakes the Capitals made at the Garden, mistakes they haven't been making at Verizon Center.

&gt;""We talk about the little decisions that shoot ourselves in the foot, whether it could be a bad pass where a guy's open and we don't hit it and we ice it,"" Oates said. ""We've done that way too much. You know what? That's part of maybe being on the road. You're a little bit extra hyped up and you pass the puck and it misses the guy by a foot and it's an icing. That's a mistake.""

&gt;One way for the Capitals to have a better start at MSG is to stay out of the penalty box. They've given the Rangers nine power-play opportunities in the first period during the series. While New York has struggled on the power play (2-for-21), being in the box has crushed any type of rhythm Washington has tried to gain early in games.

&gt;""We obviously don't want that,"" Oates said.

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt;New York's two highest-paid forwards, Rick Nash and Brad Richards, have combined for one goal and one assist in the series. Rangers coach John Tortorella won't even discuss why those two have been struggling.

&gt;""I see where all the questions are going. I'm not going to be talking about guys that are fighting it,"" Tortorella said after being asked a question specific to Nash. ""We know both of them are fighting it, I'm not going to get into a public conversation about it. It doesn't do anybody any good.""

&gt;Nash and Richards couldn't get away from talking about their struggles after practice Saturday.

&gt;""There's no excuses,"" Nash said. ""I've got to find a way to do it.""

&gt;Richards said his goal is to try to wipe out what has happened over the past five games, ""but obviously I'd like to have more to account for in the five games. It really doesn't matter. It's what's in front of us right now.""

&gt;The Rangers do have experience in Game 6 elimination situations. They won Game 6 of the conference quarterfinals last year against the Ottawa Senators and returned home to win Game 7. However, their 2011-12 season came to an end in Game 6 of the conference finals against the New Jersey Devils in Newark.

&gt;""I'm definitely not thinking it could be over,"" goalie Henrik Lundqvist said. ""That doesn't help your game. You try to enjoy the moment. It's a big game for us, everybody knows that, but so far we've been doing pretty good at home.""

---

### Injury Report:

&gt;Rangers forward Ryane Clowe (undisclosed), forward Darroll Powe (undisclosed) and defenseman Marc Staal (eye) likely are out. ... 

&gt;Capitals forwards Martin Erat (upper body) and Brooks Laich (sports hernia) are unlikely to play Sunday, although Oates left open the possibility.

|Washington|46|26|18|2|54|23  
|Winnipeg|47|24|19|4|52|22

So even with a Winnipeg regulation or OT win over Montreal for their final game, they would have 54 points and 23 ROW, tying them with us for points and the first tie breaker. 

Standings would look like this:  

|Team|GP|W|L|OT|PTS|ROW  
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|:--:  
|Washington|46|26|18|2|54|23  
|Winnipeg|48|25|19|4|54|23

We're still ahead with 2 games to play. Now say we lose our last two games. *knock on wood* Standings would now be:  

|Team|GP|W|L|OT|PTS|ROW  
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|:--:  
|Washington|48|26|20|2|54|23  
|Winnipeg|48|25|19|4|54|23 

All tied up. So what's the next tie breaker?
&gt;The greater number of points earned in games between the tied clubs. If two clubs are tied, and have not played an equal number of home games against each other, points earned in the first game played in the city that had the extra game shall not be included. If more than two clubs are tied, the higher percentage of available points earned in games among those clubs, and not including any ""odd"" games, shall be used to determine the standing.

~~Right now, the Capitals (against Winnipeg) have 15 goals for and 5 against, but the first game in Winnipeg wouldn't count since they had 3 games there. We lose 6 goals for and 1 against. (It's a stupid rule) 
So now we're at 9 goals for and 4 against.   
Plus whatever we get tomorrow.  
And if we win the game we'd have more goals for anyway and beat the tiebreaker.~~

EDIT: This is why you shouldn't do statistics with little sleep.   
Right now the Capitals (against Winnipeg) have 6 points for and 2 against. So we win the tiebreaker.

That puts us ahead of them.

### Big story:

&gt;  Fresh off a two-game sweep of the Winnipeg Jets, Washington can move within a point of the scuffling Rangers, who try to get back on track after a bad home loss to the Florida Panthers.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington was probably a loss Thursday from being unofficially eliminated from Stanley Cup Playoff contention, but blowout victories on back-to-back nights at MTS Centre in Winnipeg have put the Capitals back in the postseason discussion. Goaltender Braden Holtby was stellar both nights, and the offense roared to life with 10 goals.

With Washington in the midst of a brutal travel stretch -- 11 of 17 games away from Verizon Center in a 30-day span -- the opportunity to make a run at the top eight may be upon the Capitals. Seven of the next eight games (including this one) are against teams not in the top eight in the Eastern Conference, and six of the next seven are against the bottom clubs.

The trade deadline falls in the middle of this stretch, and what happens in the next couple of games could determine what direction general manager George McPhee decides to point his franchise for the rest of the season -- he could trade a couple of veterans, notably potential free agent Mike Ribeiro, or he could look to boslter his team's depth for a run at a playoff spot.


**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt; New York has lost four of six games since playing the Capitals two weeks ago. Offense has been a huge problem: The Rangers have seven goals in those six games, and three came against New Jersey Devils backup goaltender Johan Hedberg.

Larry Brooks of the New York Post reported offensive help could be on the way, from across the Atlantic Ocean. Brooks reported the Rangers would like to bring 21-year-old Jesper Fast, who had 18 goals and 35 points in 47 games this season in the Swedish Elitserien, to New York for a late-season push. Fast was a sixth-round pick by New York in 2010.

### Players To Watch:

&gt;Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin has six goals and nine points in the past six games, which coincides with when he and center Nicklas Backstrom were reunited on the team's top line.

* **Capitals:** John Erskine (upper body), Tomas Kundratek(lower body),  Tom Poti (back)
* **Rangers:**  Marc Staal (eye),  Arron Asham (back)

I love DC, briefly lived in Georgetown and do my best to stand to the right whenever I'm visiting.*

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one Caniac to discuss the pitiful outlook for his wretched band of redneck, NASCAR-loving, Natty Light drinking bros, we must lay blame at the feet of a Russian. A Russian named Sasha.

Alexander Semin and his enigmatic ways have forever ruined the potential Kirk Muller dynasty. He's even worse than the winter in Thunder Bay, Ontario 20 years ago with sub-tropical temperatures; the same one that abruptly ended the career of a young boy named Jared Staal.

With his poor attitude and tendency to only score highlight-reel goals in the first period -- we play 60 minutes, you asshole -- we are doomed to the bottom of the Southeast, or whatever the fuck they plan to call it next year.

Not quite the 14 or 15 win streak it was last season but this is certainly a different team.

The first period the Caps looked great.  MoJo's goal made him look like a serious vet though he probably didn't plan that one out.  He always brings energy when the other guys slump.  Much like when Ovi got laid out and embarrassed in the 2nd and needed to prove something and started skating.  Speaking of the 2nd, I thought the Caps were done for the night.  I was pissed thinking they wouldn't show up in the 3rd.  Glad I was wrong.  I was on my feet shouting when the 3rd goal went in.  Especially since the crowd was getting heavy and booing Ovi and the Caps just didn't look like they were gonna finish it off.

### Season Series:

| Date | Score | 
:--: | :--: | :--: 
Jan 29 '13|[](/r/ottawasenators) 3-2|


### Big story:

&gt;   Both are closing in on a Stanley Cup Playoff berth after recent hot streaks in what could be a preview of a first-round matchup and a showdown between two of the top candidates for the Jack Adams Award (Adam Oates of Washington and Paul MacLean of Ottawa).

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;   Alex Ovechkin keeps scoring, and Washington keeps rolling. He pushed his League-leading total to 28 on Tuesday -- 18 more than anyone on the Senators -- and the Capitals collected their eighth-straight victory. They remain four points ahead of the Winnipeg Jets, and each has five games to play, including a showdown in Washington on Tuesday.

&gt; Ovechkin has 19 goals since March 14; he scored them in a span of 33 days and 18 games. The Capitals are 14-3-1 in that span and have gone from 29th in the NHL standings on March 12 to tied for the 11th-most points before the games of Wednesday night.

**[Senators](/r/ottawasenators):**

&gt; For so long after this season was marred by injuries to critical players, Ottawa kept winning. There was a dip in form eventually; the Senators dropped five games in a row and appeared to be teetering.

&gt; A couple of key players are back from injury now (goaltender Craig Anderson and forward Milan Michalek chief among them) and the Senators have stabilized with three consecutive victories. They will make the playoffs barring a collapse, and now they need to see if/when top center Jason Spezza can help in the postseason and what a (relatively) healthy team will look like in the first round.

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Ovechkin isn't alone -- Capitals defenseman Mike Green has seven goals and 11 points in the past 10 games, and center Nicklas Backstrom has 13 assists in the past eight. ... Anderson has allowed seven goals on 108 shots (.935 save percentage) in his four games since returning from injury, which is actually below his early-season pace but still pretty great.

---

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** Tom Poti (back), Brooks Laich(groin), Joel Ward(knee)
* **Senators:**  Erik Karlsson (Achilles), Jason Spezza (back)

### Big story:

&gt;  The New York Rangers found their offense on Monday by gaining possession and going hard to the net. After scoring one goal in the first two games, they beat the Washington Capitals, 4-3, in Game 3 to pull within 2-1 in the best-of-7 series. The difference was again special teams, but it flipped on Washington. The Capitals had been strong on the power play and dominant on the penalty kill, but the Rangers were much better on the power play and were perfect on the PK in Game 3. Marc Staal returned to the Rangers' lineup after missing 29 games with an eye injury.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Washington is getting some secondary scoring from Mathieu Perreault, who scored twice in Game 4, Jay Beagle and Troy Brouwer. However, the Capitals surged up the standings in late March and April because of how well Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom and Marcus Johansson played and how productive they were.

&gt;They lost Games 3 and 4 with those players combining for one goal and 12 shots.

&gt;""I think we're creating chances and we're getting our chances to score, but we just can't seem the puck in the net,"" Johansson said. ""Sometimes, it's like that and I think if we keep playing the way we are, maybe a little better, we can score a lot of goals, I think.""

&gt;Penalties were a factor in Games 3 and 4. The Capitals gave the Rangers six power plays in Game 3 and four in Game 4.

&gt;The Rangers scored twice, with their most important power-play goal coming 59 seconds into the third period. Jason Chimera was called for interference at the 20-minute mark of the second, crushing the momentum Washington had created by scoring twice over the final seven minutes to erase a 2-0 deficit.

&gt;Washington will play Game 5 without forward Martin Erat, who suffered an upper-body injury late in the first period of Game 4. The Capitals recall Tom Wilson is expected to make his NHL debut in his place.

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt;Derick Brassard, whom the Rangers acquired at the NHL Trade Deadline on April 3, has turned into a major contributor in this series. After struggling in Games 1 and 2, Brassard picked it up in Games 3 and 4 and combined for a goal and four primary assists.

&gt;Coach John Tortorella has repeatedly praised Brassard's pass that set up Dan Girardi for a go-ahead power-play goal 59 seconds into the third period of Game 4.

&gt;""That's a hell of a play by Brass,"" Tortorella said Thursday, repeating what he said after the game Wednesday night. ""I was just watching it on tape and that's just a hell of a play. That's not a play written up, that is creativity.""

&gt;The Rangers also are getting production out of forwards Carl Hagelin and Brian Boyle. Hagelin had a goal and two assists in Game 4. Boyle scored in Game 3 and won 25 of 37 faceoffs over the past two games.

&gt;The Rangers won't say if defenseman Marc Staal will be available for Game 5 or at any point for the rest of this series. He played in Game 3, his first game since he suffered an eye injury March 5, but was a late scratch in Game 4, presumably because he was experiencing some vision issues out of his right eye.

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Brassard has five points over the past two games to lead the Rangers. Derek Stepan scored the winning goal in each of the past two games. Hagelin had three points in Game 4. … Perreault scored his first two career goals in the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Wednesday. Joel Ward was effective with a pair of assists.

### Big story:

&gt;   The time to party in Toronto is drawing ever closer, as the Maple Leafs can clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Playoffs as early as Tuesday -- any combination of four points gained by the Leafs and lost by the Winnipeg Jets, who are hosting the Tampa Bay Lightning, will end a postseason drought for Toronto that stretches back to 2004. The Capitals won't be an easy opponent, however -- they're aiming for an eighth consecutive win.

### Team Scope:

&gt;  It wasn't the way Washington drew up getting two points, but when Mike Green scored on the power play 2:59 into overtime Saturday, all that mattered to the Capitals was escaping Verizon Center with a 6-5 win over the Lightning. A three-goal first period capped by Alex Ovechkin's 27th of the season helped them build a 5-1 lead less than six minutes into the second. But the visitors staged a furious rally that threatened to end the Caps' streak in inglorious fashion before Green came through with his sixth career OT goal.

 &gt; ""It was huge. We had a couple of games in hand here [on Winnipeg] and we took advantage of them,"" said Mathieu Perreault, who assisted on a pair of goals. ""And now we have got our destiny in our hand. We have to just keep winning and not look back.""

**[Maple Leafs](/r/leafs):**

&gt; Another first-rate effort from goaltender James Reimer and a timely power-play goal from Phil Kessel was enough for Toronto to steal a 2-0 victory from the Devils on Monday in a game where the Maple Leafs were outshot by a 32-12 margin. Thanks to numerous highlight-reel stops by Reimer, the game stayed scoreless until 6:32 remained in the third period, when Kessel capitalized just eight seconds after a holding penalty on Marek Zidlicky. Jay McClement later scored into an empty net.

&gt; ""Obviously, we didn't play anywhere near what out expectations were,"" coach Randy Carlyle said, ""but the old adage of hockey is, you don't critique a win and good teams find ways to win hockey games. We didn't play very good. We didn't really have our work boots on and got out-competed early in the game, but our goaltender stole us a hockey game.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Reimer is 4-0-1 in his past five starts for the Maple Leafs, allowing a total of seven goals and posting a .956 save percentage. Kessel has six goals in his past four games. McClement has goals in consecutive games. … Ovechkin has 18 goals in 17 games for the Capitals dating back to March 14. Nicklas Backstrom has 20 assists over the same stretch. Troy Brouwer has three goals in the past two games.

### Season Series:

| Date | Score | 
:--: | :--: | :--: 
Jan 24 '13 | [](/r/habs) 4-1 |


### Big story:

&gt;  The Capitals are the NHL’s hottest team, and captain Alex Ovechkin is its hottest player. But the Canadiens represent the Capitals’ toughest test over their hot streak, so a victory here will go a long way towards determining if Washington is a legitimate threat for the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; The Capitals are being driven by Ovechkin, who has at least a point in all but one of the 10 games in this current 8-1-1 stretch that has vaulted the team to the top of the Southeast Division. The Capitals scored 38 goals over that stretch, and Ovechkin had 13 of them while adding six assists, meaning he was in on half his team’s goals over the past 10 games.

&gt;However, this game against the Canadiens will be just the third time in 11 games that the Capitals have faced a team currently in the playoffs, and the first time in that span they faced anyone in the top six of the conference.

&gt;“We just have to keep rolling,” Ovechkin told the Monumental Network on Monday. “[Tuesday] is going to be a hard game going up against one of the best teams in the League right now. It’s a good challenge for us, so we just have to keep going.”

**[Canadiens](/r/habs):**

&gt; The Canadiens learned Monday that defenseman Alexei Emelin would be lost for the rest of the regular season and Stanley Cup Playoffs with a torn ACL in his left knee, and injury suffered in Saturday night’s 2-1 win against the Boston Bruins when he hit Milan Lucic but landed awkwardly on the knee.

&gt;Coach Michel Therrien has decided to promote Davis Drewiske to play the right side with Andrei Markov on Montreal’s second pair and Nathan Beaulieu was called up from the American Hockey League to play on the third pairing with Francis Bouillon. Drewiske, acquired a day before the NHL trade deadline from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for a fifth round draft pick, will now have much greater responsibilities than originally anticipated.

&gt;“You can’t ask a player to play a style that they’re not comfortable with,” Therrien said. “Players need to be who they are. We've lost important players all season long, but the team continued winning.”

&gt;There was some good news on the injury front for Montreal, as forward Rene Bourque appears ready to return after missing 21 games with a concussion. His status for the game will be confirmed Tuesday morning, but if he plays, he should skate on Montreal’s fourth line with Jeff Halpern and Travis Moen.


### Players To Watch:

&gt;   For the Capitals, the obvious one is Ovechkin, but his center, Nicklas Backstrom, has been reaping the benefits of this hot streak for No. 8, with nine assists in his past four games. Defenseman Mike Green has six goals and two assists in the 10 games since he returned from an injury. … For the Canadiens, defenseman P.K. Subban has a goal and nine assists in six games. Rookie forward Alex Galchenyuk has goals in his past two games and points in three straight.

He ultimately decided that he was more into hockey than college, managed to try out and make it onto the Idaho Steelheads, and win the Kelly Cup with them. A Caps scout saw him, invited him to camp, and he made the Bears that same year. Two years later the Bears won the Calder Cup... twice. 

He's got one big shiny thing left to go at this point, and hot damn, I want to see him win it with this team.

Anyways I'm calling on the /r/caps community to help each other through these dark time. I need a place where I won't be surrounded by doom and gloom so let's have this be a thread of positivity.

I'll start:

We have seen that this Caps team is a mentally strong one compared to the teams of years past. We bounced back from a triple overtime loss and we can sure as hell bounce back from a game that we really didn't have much business winning. If the Caps play a full 60 minutes and come out hungry and playing like the team we know they can I don't see any reason we don't have a damned good shot at taking Game 6. 

Once you get to Game 7 anything can happen. We've just got to out work the Rangers Wednesday and everyone know the Rangers aren't going to make it easy for us. 

Keep the faith.

### Big story:

&gt;  The Capitals are surging and trying to wrap up the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Carolina Hurricanes are fading and close to contending for a top-three pick in the 2013 NHL Draft.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington is 11-3-1 since losing that first game of the home-and-home to Carolina, including wins in five straight. The Capitals, which relinquished the Southeast Division crown to the Florida Panthers last season after winning it four straight times, hold a two-point lead on the Winnipeg Jets and have a game in hand on them. Washington plays six of its final eight games at Verizon Center.

&gt; Captain Alex Ovechkin is tied for the NHL lead with 26 goals, and center Nicklas Backstrom is third in the League with 36 assists -- four behind Tampa Bay Lightning forward Martin St. Louis and five behind Pittsburgh Penguins forward Sidney Crosby.

**[Hurricanes](/r/canes):**

&gt; Carolina defeated Washington 4-0 on March 12 and took a 2-0 lead on the Capitals two days later. Washington rallied for a 3-2 victory, and the teams have gone in opposite directions since. Carolina is 1-12-1 since that 4-0 victory, falling from a place inside the top eight in the East to 27th in the NHL and two points ahead of the 28th- and 29th-place teams.

&gt; Losing goalie Cam Ward was a huge problem, but also losing defensemen Justin Faulk and Joni Pitkanen to injuries crippled the Hurricanes. They have lost 10 of 11 since March 19, allowing 47 goals in the 10 losses. Their top two centers, Eric Staal and Jordan Staal, are a combined minus-28 in that span.


### Players To Watch:

&gt;   Ovechkin continued his torrid pace with a goal Tuesday against the Montreal Canadiens. He has 17 goals in his past 15 games. ... Carolina has lost 13 of the past 14 games -- pretty tough to make a compelling argument for anyone being ""hot.""

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** Tom Poti (back), Martin Erat (lower body), Brooks Laich(groin), Joel Ward(knee)
* **Hurricanes:**  Cam War (knee), Joni Pitkanen (heel)

Ov skating end to end on a PP then came back to take the puck away from Boston... another good thing to see when the Captain is showing he wants a goal and he's alive.

I also understand that nearly all of our star players aren't putting up numbers like they did in the past. As fans we all have the right to bitch and moan and complain when our team isn't performing. We also have the right to scrutinize strategies and criticize the effort that is given. And yes, last night's game was probably the worst of the entire season. Let me just say this, choose now whether or not you are a fan of this team and organization. You are a poor fan if you only like the team when we are winning. This team is already one of the most hated (or laughed at) teams in the NHL. We don't need piss-poor fair weather fans, who only like the team when we win the President's trophy and Ovechkin puts up 65 goals, to add gas to the fire.

Let me start out by saying, does anyone remember the beginning of the season? I mean fuck, we were last place in the league for a while there, and we turned that all around, wow. How? Well I've compiled a list of the positives from the season.

  * **1. Coaching**

Seriously guys, this one is a keeper. More so than Boudreau in my opinion. Oates got fucked over by the lockout and came into a team playing an **entirely** different system then he wanted, that plus he was their 3rd coach in less then a year. And yet he somehow managed to fight through a bout of injuries and 4th line grinders (cough cough, Crabb and Volpatti) and put us in the playoffs. We played half of a season that already had half of it missing and made the playoffs, that is enough to be proud of in my opinion. The East better look out next year because Oates is serious coaching material.

* **2. The ""Young"" Guns**

Alex Ovechkin, Mike Green, Nick Backstrom. All of them are back. Maybe not in full force (definitely not in Backstrom's case in my opinion). But Ovechkin and Mike Green are the highest scoring players in their respective positions, when was the last time that happened. I mostly attribute this to the tremendous job by Adam Oates, it is pretty much common knowledge that he turned OV around, and a healthy Mike Green is a sight to behold (he needs to never go below the opposing goal line though, really).

* **3. The (new) Young Guns**

Johannson, Perrault, Olesky, Wilson, Beagle, Kundratek, Orlov, Holtby, Latta, Barber... hell, who am I forgetting. But really, the future looks pretty bright. Besides trading away Forsberg for what turned out to be a soggy piece of tissue paper (maybe this will pan out, who knows), things look good for the future. Olesky, Orlov, and Kundratek look to carry our defense into the next era, while Johannson and Perrault provide great finesse and Wilson serving up a nice amount of physicality. Oh, and Braden Holtby...

* **4. Goaltending**

This is the first time in a while I thought the Caps had a sold franchise goalie. Does he let softies in, sometimes. Is he perfect, by no means. But wait, he is a prospect and still developing, by the time he has matured he will be fantastic.

* **5. New Acquisitions**

The jury is still out on Mike Ribeiro, but we did gain a great winger in Eric Fehr. Beyond that a lot of our offseason dealing went sour, Crabb, Wolski, I'm lookin' at you! But who's that? Jack Hillen! I'll be honest, for the first half of the season I was quite indifferent, but the guy has grown on me and I see him as a positive.

**Some negatives**

We have to remain realistic. Injuries took a bit of a toll on us this year. I'm not a big fan of the time that Laich and Erat had to take off, and Laich is the last person I want to see become the next Mike ""Glass Groin"" Green (check flair). Along with this, we floundered early in the playoffs, there were moments of brilliance, but we can't blame the officials in Game 7, that was all us. It also looks like we lost some of the ""veteran effect"" with Mike Knuble, in my opinion Ribeiro is a bit too much of a yapper to serve that purpose and Brouwer isn't quite there yet. (Note: I'm not sure of all the post season free agents yet, but I'm sure there are a few negatives there.)

Well thanks for reading this wall of text if you got through it, it was really to keep me from crying myself to sleep tonight, which it did quite well. With all the above mentioned I'm optimistic as fuck about next year, Oates has a great system, our goalie problem appears to have been solved, we have great young and old talent a like, and our stars are beginning to become all-star like again, to summarize. 

I'd like to end all of this by saying it has been a great season and I wouldn't have spent it with anyone else but you guys here and the friends/enemies over at /r/hockey.

### Big story:

&gt; The Capitals can continue to tighten the Southeast Division race with another regulation win Friday. Winnipeg leads the Carolina Hurricanes by two points, with Washington and the Tampa Bay Lightning both seven points out of first.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; It might be difficult for Washington not to use Braden Holtby again in this back-to-back situation: He hasn't allowed a goal at MTS Centre in two games this month. Holtby has made 55 saves in the two games, which included a 3-0 win on March 2.

&gt; ""Last time they just threw everything at the net and they were hoping for a bounce or a rebound or what-not,"" Holtby said. ""Today it seemed like they were more patient with it. That is a credit to us being in the right position, too, not giving them those lanes no matter where they are on the ice to shoot the puck.""

&gt;Alex Ovechkin had a three-point game Thursday, including his League-leading ninth power-play goal. He has 74 points (35 goals, 39 assists) in 51 career games against the Winnipeg franchise.
&gt;""The intensity of the game right now for us is very important,"" Ovechkin said. ""I have to be better out there -- all the guys have to be better to take a step forward
&gt;""Tomorrow is going to be a much harder game, 100 percent. They're going to come out harder and the crowd is going to be into it.""

&gt;Defenseman Mike Green returned from injury and played 22:44. Brooks Laich played his second game of the season and had an assist.
&gt;""When these guys are back out there, we have more confidence,"" Ovechkin said.

**[Jets](/r/winnipegjets):**

&gt; Thursday was a stunning end to a 6-1-1 streak by Winnipeg that was capped by a 3-1 win against the Boston Bruins on Tuesday.
&gt;""It's nice that there's a short turnaround and we have a chance to redeem ourselves right away,"" captain Andrew Ladd said. ""We're not happy with the result tonight and you should be upset about that and that should motivate you to be a whole lot better tomorrow.""

&gt;Goalie Al Montoya was activated off injured reserve and could give Ondrej Pavelec a break -- Pavelec has made eight straight starts and played in 19 of the past 20 games.
&gt;""You have to change something, you can't go and do the same things, you just got beat twice,"" coach Claude Noel said, not specifically mentioning the goaltenders. ""Of course you've got to change something, you've got to look at a lot of things. I don't know what it's going to be, but tomorrow will be a new day. We get to play the same opponent, so that's a good thing.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Ovechkin has four goals and three assists in the past five games after going three games without a point. Forward Nicklas Backstrom has two two-point games in his past three. … Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien has seven points in his past six games. Ladd has at least one point in eight of 11 March games.

### Big story:

&gt; The Hurricanes can strengthen their hold on the Southeast Division, while this is as close to a must-win game a desperate Capitals team can have with 23 contests remaining in a season.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; The first meeting with Carolina this season was the start of five wins in a six-game stretch that had Washington edging back into playoff contention … but three straight losses and more injuries on the back end have left the franchise closer to despair than any point since a 2-8-1 start.
&gt; A regulation loss to the Hurricanes in this contest would leave the Capitals 12 points back of Carolina and possible eight points shy of eighth place in the East. Three members of the defense corps began the season playing with Hershey in the American Hockey League, and the offense has sputtered with three goals in the past three games. If all that wasn't enough, lack of discipline -- a huge issue early in the season -- has been a big culprit the past three games.

&gt; Wolski and Perreault are healthy scratches for tonight

**[Hurricanes](/r/canes):**

&gt;Carolina won back-to-back games against Florida to start March and appeared poised to grab control of the Southeast Division. One problem -- workhorse goaltender Cam Ward was hurt March 3 in the second of those wins and it was announced he'd miss 6-8 weeks.
&gt;The Hurricanes haven't missed a beat without Ward -- they've won three of four and now lead the Southeast by three points with a game in hand on second-place Winnipeg. The offense has been rolling -- 33 goals since being shutout in Washington, including 10 in back-to-back wins against New Jersey and in the rematch with the Capitals.

### Players To Watch:
&gt;Mathieu Perreault has three points in his past three games for the Capitals. Semin has 13 points in his past seven games for the Hurricanes.

---

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** Brooks Laich (groin), John Erskine (upper body), Mike Green (groin), Jack Hillin (upper body), Tom Poti (upper body)
* **Hurricanes:** Cam Ward, Chad LaRose (concussion), Toumo Ruutu (hip), Joni Pitkanen (lower body)

It was over the second the Rangers scored the second goal. The Rangers outplayed you guys, their defense was great, and Lunqvist was spectacular as usual. You guys came back home after a loss at MSG looking to put the Rangers out. You came back home and absolutely let us, the fans, down. We have supported you all season, and you gave us hope. You put in so much work, and we salute you for it. The season was very exciting, you came back from a terrible start to win the division. 
I always had hope for our team, and Adam Oates did a great job this year. The series started off so well, and then we gave the momentum back to the Rangers. I am just so frustrated, angry, and sad. I wouldn't have been so crushed about this if this game 7 was close. I should be used to this, and shouldn't be so hopeful every year, because no matter the momentum, record, or players, the playoffs just make us shrink away and go away. I didn't want to see Michael j. Fox eat a cupcake with the logo I love, but it will have to be. Here's to next season, I can only hope the next season ends better than this one.

-""The refs are totally idiots/biased. They totally missed call X""

-""The caps are only in playoffs because its a weak division""

I'm sure Im missing some of their classic comebacks but here's the new ones I'm hearing this year:

-""This isn't even a real season, like when we win 82 game seasons.""

-""We only lose at Verizon center because they make it louder in there pumping noise in the speakers""

### Big story:

&gt;   The NHL's top two goal scorers square off as the Capitals look to stretch their winning streak to seven games and stay in front of the Winnipeg Jets in the Southeast Division title race.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington has a two-point lead and a game in hand on the Jets, and capturing a fifth division title in six seasons remains the priority for the Capitals. That said, the team's winning ways of late have positioned it to also have a chance to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs without claiming the No. 3 seed.

&gt;But the Capitals have their eye on the division title, not merely making the top eight.

&gt;""We've put ourselves in a great situation to make the playoffs and have home-ice advantage in the first round,"" said forward Troy Brouwer, who scored twice in Thursday's 3-1 home victory against the Carolina Hurricanes. ""I don't think after those first games when we were 2-8-1 anyone would have guessed this.""

**[Lightning](/r/tampabaylightning):**

&gt; Tampa Bay started this season 6-1-0 and scored 37 goals in those seven contests. The Lightning have remained one of the top offensive teams in the NHL -- they're third at 3.15 goals per game -- but keeping the other team from scoring has been an issue since the hot start.

&gt; The Lightning are the only non-playoff team in the Eastern Conference to boast a positive goal-differential, but it has steadily fallen since the first seven games. Someone scored at least four goals in each of those first seven games -- the Lightning did six times and their opponent once -- but it has been the wrong team far too often since (14 times in 33 contests, including a 6-3 home loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday).

&gt; ""We just have a lot of things to learn,"" coach Jon Cooper said. ""They have a mentality right now and you're not going to change it overnight. We were passing up an 'A' opportunity for a 'B' opportunity, and that's the mentality we have to get out of our heads.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt; This game also features two of the top three setup men in the NHL. Washington's Nicklas Backstrom has 12 assists in his past six games and is now third in the NHL with 37. Tampa Bay's Martin St. Louis has six in his past five games and is now tied with Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby for the League lead at 41.

### Big story:

&gt;  Martin Erat will make his Washington debut and both teams are desperately seeking points near the playoff cut line in the Eastern Conference.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington general manager George McPhee made a bold statement before the deadline Thursday, sending 2012 first-round pick Filip Forsberg to Nashville for wing Martin Erat. He'll slide into a spot on the team's top two lines and provide some of the scoring depth from the wing Washington has been missing with Alexander Semin in Carolina.

&gt;The Capitals have moved within two points of first place in the Southeast Division, and claiming that spot would mean home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs and not having to face the Pittsburgh Penguins or Boston Bruins.

**[Islanders](/r/newyorkislanders):**

&gt; New York general manager Garth Snow did not make any deals before the trade deadline, but the Islanders did welcome Anders Lee to the lineup on Tuesday and the former Notre Dame captain scored on his first NHL shot in a 5-2 victory against the Winnipeg Jets.

&gt; The Islanders are in a strong position -- eighth place in the East entering Wednesday’s action and they could move into seventh with the right results Thursday. They also have four of the next five contests at home, and each of those four are against teams behind them in the standings.

&gt; “There’s a long way to go,” forward Frans Nielsen told the team's website after the win Tuesday against the Jets. “There are still a lot of points up for grabs. You have to play for it. It’s fun where we are in the standings right now, but there’s still a lot of work to do.”


### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Isles center John Tavares has eight goals and 12 points in the past 13 games, including three goals in the two contests against Washington. … Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin has 11 goals and 17 points in his past 11 games -- which also happens to be the timeframe for when he and center Nicklas Backstrom were reunited on the top line.

Mar 09 '13 | [](/r/newyorkislanders) 5-2 |



### Big story:

&gt;  The Capitals have won three in a row and five of seven to climb the closest they’ve been to a playoff spot all season, while the Islanders ended a three-game losing streak Sunday and could move ahead of Washington into 10th place in the Eastern Conference.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington went on a critical four-game road trip, and after playing well in defeat in Pittsburgh, the Capitals grabbed six much-needed points with two wins against Winnipeg and one against the New York Rangers -- the team’s first road win against a non-Southeast Division team this season.

&gt;Now the Capitals have a chance to be within three points of the division lead or level with one or more teams at 33 points -- which the eighth-place Rangers have now -- if they can win a fourth straight contest for the first time this season.

&gt;“Most important thing is everybody’s healthy,” captain Alex Ovechkin said. “We can play all four of our forward lines. The system is working, and goalies play well, D play well, forwards play well. We just have to continue to do it.”

**[Islanders](/r/newyorkislanders):**

&gt; fter dropping three straight games to start a critical homestand, New York salvaged a win against last-place Florida two days ago. Holding leads and being outplayed in the third period has been a big problem for the Islanders, but they had little trouble with the Panthers.

&gt;Now the Islanders are back on the road, and they are 8-4-1 away from Long Island.

&gt;""We needed a win,"" center John Tavares told the team's website. ""Games are starting to quickly tick down and we need the wins. It's good to finish it the right way and get ready for a big road trip.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;New York goaltender Evgeni Nabokov has two shutouts in his last five games and March has been his best statistical month of the season (6-3-1, .908 save percentage, 2.47 goals-against average). No one is hotter than Ovechkin right now, who was named the NHL’s first star of the week Monday after collecting five goals and eight points in the past four games.

What are beer prices like at Verizon for the games?  I usually have a few when I go out to watch each game at local sports bars but really don't feel like paying the price of 2 twelve packs for up to 4 beers.  Which leads to my next question...

Is it possible to sneak a small flask or anything into Verizon?  We had the idea of getting a beer there and pouring from a flask into our empty cups :p  Do people tend to rat you out or give you shit for doing this?

Best pre-game or post-game places to visit?  I'm native around the DC area but I've never really hung around Verizon or visited very often to know what's around.

Lastly, how cold is it inside Verizon?  The only Caps gear I have is a Holtby t-shirt and a Caps hat, worried I might freeze. Would a thermal underneath be fine or is it like Kettler where it's not very cold inside the arena?  The smaller rinks like Prince William Ice I've been to it's been really fucking cold inside.

### Big story:

&gt;  The Capitals have won their way into first place in the Southeast Division, but one loss can send a team in that spot from holding the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference to outside the top eight -- just ask the Winnipeg Jets about that.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; After a terrible 2-8-1 start, the Capitals woke up Friday morning in a playoff position for the first time all season. They have gone 16-9-1 since, and climbed to the top of the mediocre Southeast Division by beating the New York Islanders 2-1 in a shootout on Thursday. Their hold on the top spot is tenuous -- four teams are bunched within four points, and none would be in the top eight of the conference at this point if not for the division winner earning a top-three seed.

&gt;Still, the Capitals are rolling and their stars are leading the way. Alex Ovechkin is back among the League's goal-scoring leaders, Nicklas Backstrom has a team-leading 30 assists and oft-injured Mike Green is back producing important offense from the blue line.

&gt;The schedule has been light on top teams but tough on travel/fatigue -- this contest and the one Sunday in Tampa Bay complete a stretch of 17 games in 30 days, including 11 on the road. The finishing kick includes more time to rest, but also six of the final 10 contests are against teams currently in the top six in the East.

**[Panthers](/r/floridapanthers):**

&gt; Florida's season has been a mess because of injuries and regression after a surprising division title in 2011-12, but the missing veterans has allowed the Panthers to give playing time to some key young players who will be part of the next potential division winner. Another of those players will make his NHL debut Saturday as center Nick Bjugstad joined the team earlier this week.

&gt;Bjugstad is huge (6-foot-6, 220 pounds) and skilled, and could form a dynamic 1-2 punch with Jonathan Huberdeau in the middle for the Panthers. He'll likely play on a line with another 2010 first-round pick, Quinton Howden, as the Panthers try for a season-high fourth consecutive victory.


### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Green has five goals in Washington's past four games and now leads the League in even-strength goals by a defenseman with seven despite missing 13 games because of injury. … Florida's Shawn Matthias also has five goals in his past four games and has four more in 39 games (14) than he's had in any of his previous four NHL seasons with at least 50 games played.

* **Capitals:** Tom Poti (back), Brooks Laich(lower body)
* **Panthers:**  Stephen Weiss (wrist),  Kris Versteeg (knee)

### Big story:

&gt; These teams play twice in as many nights in Winnipeg -- the Capitals probably need a sweep to foster any fleeting hope about making the playoffs while the Jets can cement their hold on the Southeast Division lead.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; For about four weeks, the Washington Capitals looked like the team many pundits expected them to be. After an abject start, the Capitals went 8-3-0 from Feb. 9 to Mar. 7 and appeared on the verge of being back in the playoff race.

&gt; Then came a lost weekend in New York, a three-game losing streak and four games of running in place. The result has left the Capitals in 14th place in the Eastern Conference and nine points back of the Jets in the Southeast. Even a well-played defeat like the one Tuesday in Pittsburgh does nothing for Washington at this point. It is ""start a long winning streak time"" or else for the Capitals.

**[Jets](/r/winnipegjets):**

&gt; When Winnipeg lost to Washington at MTS earlier this month, it was the sixth defeat in 10 games in a building where the Jets were fantastic last season. After a third-period rally Tuesday against Boston, the Jets have now won three straight at home and have stormed to the top of the division.

&gt; Winnipeg still has 11 of its final 18 games at home, and the Jets just went 4-1-1 in a relatively difficult segment of the schedule. They also have 11 of their final 18 against teams currently outside the top eight in the East.

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Alex Ovechkin has three goals and an assist in the past four games for Washington after going the three previous contests without a point. Blake Wheeler has three multi-goal games in his past five for Winnipeg.

---

### Big story:

&gt; The Penguins are riding a nine-game winning streak going into Tuesday's game against a streaky Capitals club. It's no secret that the teams really don't like each other and Washington has its sights set on ending the Penguins' streak.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Despite beating Buffalo 5-3 at home on Sunday, Washington is on the outside looking in at the top eight in the East, and this week could make or break the Caps' playoff chances. They visit Pittsburgh, play back-to-back games in Winnipeg and finish against the Rangers in New York.

&gt;Washington could get a boost from the return of forward Brooks Laich, one of the team leaders. He hasn't played this season due to a groin injury but is almost ready to go. Laich wanted to play Sunday against Buffalo but was kept out as a precaution.

&gt;Laich spoke to the Washington Post on Sunday and addressed the issue. ""I'm feeling good on the ice and I'm getting really anxious to play. I'm sure it'll be very, very soon,"" he said. ""In my mind it's sooner than later. I'm really getting the itch, really wanting to get back in the lineup.""

&gt;Braden Holtby has started the previous two games against Pittsburgh, in which the Caps have surrendered 11 goals. That could mean a start for backup Michal Neuvirth.

**[Penguins](/r/penguins):**

&gt; Pittsburgh's defense has become as efficient as its offense, and the Penguins are the hottest team in the League. Marc-Andre Fleury is coming off a franchise-record 23rd shutout on Saturday and will be back in net against the Caps.

&gt;Fellow Quebec native Pascal Dupuis is playing on the most explosive line in hockey but was vocal about the defense after Sunday's 2-1 win against Boston kept the winning streak alive. ""It's fun for a little while -- guys get points,"" Dupuis said of his team's offense-first mentality early in the streak. ""But it's not the way to win in the playoffs, so we buckled down lately in the last couple weeks there and we are playing the right way and we're still winning games. That's the main thing there.""

&gt;In their last five games the Penguins have given up only five goals -- a turnaround for a team that had a goals-against average hovering around 3.0 for much of the season.

### Players To Watch:

&gt;Alex Ovechkin has goals in two of Washington's past three games and leads the team with 11. … Fleury has won his last four decisions and allowed only three goals while going 3-0-0 last week.

Yeah


It wouldn't be playoff hockey unless NBC had the inevitable Rangers/Caps series. So, Cap fans, what do I need to know about your team before the series. Besides Ovi's hot streak and Greene and Backstrom, who do I need to look out for, what are your strengths? Your weaknesses? Spill the beans, and I'll gladly do the same. 


Rangers have sucked this year. There I said it. We were just as inconsistent as we were in the playoffs last year. It would be win one game, lose two, win the series against the Bruins, lose the series to the Panthers. It's been an up and down road and we would not be in the playoffs if it wasn't for Henrik Lundqvist. Do I have to say any more? He's been our backbone for quite some time now and he has no signs of cooling down. Rangers struggled all year up until the trade deadline. We were sitting in tenth place when we acquired Ryane Clowe, Derrick Brassard, Derrick Dorsett, and John Moore. All of them (excluding Dorsett who is out with an injury) made immediate impact on the team.  Since then, the Rangers went 10-3-1 (With 51 Goals), leading the way into the playoffs. I'd have to say we have been just as hot as the Caps have been, and have no signs of slowing down. 

**Players To Watch**

*The Derrick's* - No matter how you spell it, all three Derrick's have been/will be hot. Stepan has lead the way offensively this year, with 18 goals (One more he had last season) and 26 Assists. No matter who he has played with, he makes anyone around him look good. Derrick Brassard is another one to look out for. Since coming to the Rangers, he has 5 goals and 6 assists in 13 games, but has made plays that has lead to many scoring chances. Derrick Dorsett, who has yet to make his debut with the Rangers, is another one to watch for. He brings back the hard working play that the Rangers lost in Prust, and makes them a tougher team. 

*Clowe, The Hobbit, and The Captain* - Ryane Clowe was brought in because of his big size and playoff ability. With 45 points in 68 playoff games, and him playing well since coming to the Rangers, (8 points in 12 games), he will be a big factor when he returns to the lineup. Zuccarello, also known as The Hobbit, plays with heart on the ice. He has been hitting more (even though he is 5'6), creating MANY scoring chances, and being a factor in front of the net. 8 points in 15 games does him no justice because he has done many things that have lead to goals. And of course, The Captain. You'll find everything a hockey player wants in Ryan Callahan, and he will play every shift like it is game seven in overtime. *This is where I remind you to also watch out for Rick Nash*

**Strengths**

Our big strengths are our defense, lead by Lundqvist and topped off with Girardi/McDonaugh, as well as our play along the boards. Rangers have been winning the battles along the boards lately which have helped them greatly, and with a defense built as solidly as the Rangers, and with Staal (possibly) being ready for game 1, it will be tough to find a guy who would make a defensive mistake in that lineup. Unlike last year's playoffs, where 2/3 guys where getting thirty minutes a game, and other less than ten (cough Bickel), Torts now has the ability to play everyone evenly because their defense is rounded out so nicely.

**Weaknesses**

The Power Play. My god I hate our power play. We suck. Is there anything more I can say? Take all the penalties you want because you are guaranteed to score more on our power play than we are. Also, Turnovers and Slowness. Brad Richards has been the king of both this year, so I wouldn't be surprised if he gives up the puck that leads to an odd man rush a few times this series. Plus he isn't very fast...neither is Clowe or Boyle, but we make that up with having Zucc, Hags, and Brass playing on the same line with them.

**Conclusion** 

Wow I wrote a lot. I learned from my mistake last year that nothing is ever easy. Playoffs are indeed a new season. But unlike last year's team we have more scoring depth, healthy players, and a well rested Lundqvist. I think both teams are in good shape and I do not know what to expect. Rangers did beat the Caps in the season series, but like I said that doesn't matter, and it was before they started being the hottest team in the NHL. Good luck to you guys, it should be fun as usual. ",,False,self,t5_2rouz,False,,,True,t3_1ddb5w,http://www.reddit.com/r/caps/comments/1ddb5w/ranger_fan_here_looking_for_the_inside_scoop_on/,

Well here we are again, for the 4th time in 5 years. I'm sure this will be another exciting round of playoff hockey between two currently hot teams. Even when the Rangers are playing well, and they have been lately, I know how good the Capitals can be, especially Ovechkin (he's probably my favorite non-Rangers player), so the nervousness that comes with watching playoff hockey is already setting in. Either way, it should be a lot of fun. May the best team win!

Toronto did the unthinkable and beat Buffalo, again a chance to get a significant lead and literally all but knock out Buffalo.  Go out against the Lightning and completely choke away a lead again.

Well, now our powder-puff chances of backing into the playoffs are gone.  Buffalo keeps proving they want to be in the playoffs by showing up to play more often than not.  Referee help or no help for Buffalo shouldn't matter to us.  If the Capitals want it, they need to earn it.

We have two playoff teams left on our schedule.  The Rangers look like they will be our first round match up.  Buffalo also has to play two playoff teams.  May the best team win the spot.

On a side note.  There is a possibility that the Rangers don't play many of their top players very much during our match up against them since they already clinched the #1 seed.

*Notable Players*  

Name|Position|Number|Years with Team|GP|Goals|Assists|Points
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Adam Oates|C|77|1997-2002|419|79|304|383

 * Oates went undrafted before being signed to the Detroit Red Wings. He played for the St. Louis Blues and Boston Bruins. During that time, he averaged 114 points per season, second only to Gretzky.before he was traded to the Capitals after he publicly berated the Bruins’ management when the team failed to make the playoffs again.
 * Oates initially refused to report to the Capitals, but after a small hold out, he finally reported but demanded a new contract in the off-season. Following Dale Hunter’s retirement, Oates was named Captain before the 99-00 season. He collected his 1000th point and 1000th game with Washington while only reaching the Stanley Cup Finals once. Following the disappointing 2000-01 season, Oates demanded a trade from the management. They refused at first, but stripped Oates of his Captaincy. He would be dealt to the Flyers the following season.  
 * Retired : April 4, 2004  
 * Inducted into HHOF : 2012 
 * Oates would return to coach the Capitals prior to the 2012-13 season. After an unproductive beginning, the Capitals would eventually fall into Oates’ system well and finish the season with only 2 losses in the month of April. Oates came in 5th place in Jack Adams Award voting.

Peter Bondra|RW|12|1990-2004|961|472|352|825

 * Bondra was drafted in the eighth round at #156 by the Washington Capitals. Bondra was a prolific goal-scorer and regularly led the team in goals. His deepest playoff run came during the 1997-98 season. The team reached the Stanley Cup Finals before losing to the Detroit Red Wings.
 * In the 2004 season, Bondra's 14th with Washington, the Capitals endured a disappointing year. General Manager George McPhee and Owner Ted Leonsis decided the team needed a rebuild and traded many veteran members. Bondra was traded to the Ottawa Senators for Brooks Laich and a second round draft pick. At the press conference announcing his trade Bondra became noticeably choked up.
 * He holds Capitals team records in goals (472), points (825), power-play goals (137), game-winning goals (73), short-handed goals (32) and hat tricks (19). 
 * Retired: October 29, 2007.
 * In 2004, the Capitals held a vote for fans to determine the top 30 players in franchise history to celebrate their 30th season in the league. Bondra finished second with 2,018 votes. The winner, Olaf Kölzig, beat him by only 20 votes.

Rod Langway|D|5|1982-1993|726|50|177|227

 * Langway did not start playing hockey until he was 13 years old. He played for his high school team and led them to tourney appearances in 1973 and 1975. He was the quarterback for his high school team and it was a University of New Hampshire football scout that convinced him to play hockey for UNH.
 * Drafted in 1977 to both the Montreal Canadiens and WHA team Birmingham Bulls. He played one year for the Bulls before joining the Canadiens for the 1978-79 season. The Canadiens won the Stanley Cup that year. 
 * Traded to Capitals for the start of the 1982-83 season. Langway was traded along with Doug Jarvis, Craig Laughlin, and Brian Engblom in exchange for Ryan Walter and Rick Green. This has been said to be a trade that saved the Capitals from moving out of D.C.  
 * Named Captain in 1982. The Capitals reached the postseason for the first time when Langway joined the team. For each of the 11 years Langway was with the team, the Capitals made a playoff appearance. Langway would win the Norris Trophy that year and the next and runner-up Wayne Gretzky for the Hart Trophy in 1982-83.
 * While not an effective scorer (only scored 9 goals in his best season), his leadership and strive for himself and others to always be better earned him the nickname the ""Secretary of Defense"" and he is credited with saving the Capitals from relocation.
 * Retired 1993
 * Number retired November 26, 1997
 * Inducted into Hockey Hall of Fame: 2002

Olaf Kölzig|G|37|1989-2008|764|323|321|127|1,985|21,494|.917|2.43|44,469

 * Olie the Goalie (AKA Godzilla) was drafted in the first round by the Caps but played most of his first year in the minors. He scored one goal and got in one fight during his time there. Kolzig’s start in the NHL was anything but good. He only played 2 games in his first year, losing both for a combined 6.00 GAA and .810 SV%. He was immediately sent down to the minors for abother 5 years until he was brought up to back up Jim Carey in the 1995-96 season. 
 * During the 1997-98 season, Bill Ranford would suffer an injury and Kolzig would finish the season, posting a much better 2.20 GAA with 33 wins in 64 games. He led the Capitals to the Stanley Cup Finals, posted 4 shutouts in the playoffs (only the 10th goalie in NHL history to do so).
 * Won the Vezina in 1999-2000 as he finished the season with 5 shutouts, 2.24 GAA, and a .917 SV% but had an underwhelming playoff appearance.  
 * In February 2008, the Capitals acquried Cristobal Huet, who gradually took over as starting goaltender. The Capitals qualified for the playoffs and Huet started every game of the first round against the Philadelphia Flyers, yet lost in seven.
 * 300th win: March 12, 2008. Only the 23rd goalie at the time to do so.
 * Following the Capitals elimination against the Flyers, Kölzig announced that he did not intend to return to the team. On July 1, 2008, he became a free agent and signed a 1 year, $1.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He served as back-up to Mike Smith until January 28, 2009, when it was announced he would miss the rest of the season with ruptured bicep tendons in his left arm.
 * On March 4, 2009, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs  alone with Jamie Heward, Andy Rogers, and a 4th round pick in exchange for Richard Petiot. Since his injury would make him miss the rest of the season, this was seen as Toronto buying a draft pick for his contract.
 * Retired: September 23, 2009
 * Holds virtually every Capital franchise record at his position. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_K%C3%B6lzig#Washington_Capitals_records)
 * Currently serves as Associate Goalie Coach for  the Capitals

Dale Hunter|C|1987-1998|1,593|365|773|1,138|4,294

 * Drafted 41st overall by the Quebec Nordiques in 1979, he played seven seasons for the Nordiques, racking up 500 points and 957 penalty minutes garnering him the nickname “La Petite Peste”. Despite this, he was a fan favorite and known to be humble in the locker room and a gentleman to other players off the ice.  
 * He was traded alongside Clint Marlachuk in 1987 to the Capitals for Gaetan Duchesne, Alan Hanworth, and Washington's 1st round draft pick in 1987. That pick turned out to be Joe Sakic.  
 * Hunter continued his nuiscance nature when he arrived in Washington. Soon becoming another fan favorite. In his first season he tallied 71 points and 338 penalty minutes.
 * On April 28, 1993, in Game 6 of the Patrick Division Semifinals, Hunter blindsided NY Islanders captain Pierre Turgeon several moments after Turgeon stole  the puck off a bad pass from Hunter to score a goal and make the score 5-1. Hunter's attack left Turgeon with a separated shoulder and cause him to miss all but one of his team's remaining playoff games. New NHL commissioner Gary Bettman had promised earlier to crack down on violence and suspended Hunter for 21 games of the next season. One-quarter of the season. Years later, Hunter admitted he had gone too far.
 * In 1994, he was named captain of the Capitals.
 * He led the Capitals to the playoffs all but one year (1996-97), helping cement rivalries along the way.
 * March 23, 1999 : Following an injury-plagued season for the Capitals, the organization traded Hunter with their 3rd round choice to the Colorado Avalanche for Vancouver's 2nd round choice (previously acquired) to give him one last shot at the cup.
 * Hunter retired in 1999, finishing his career with 323 goals and 1,020 points in 1,407 games. He is ranked second all-time with 3,565 regular-season penalty minutes, trailing only Dave ""Tiger"" Williams. Hunter tops the all-time list for post-season penalty minutes with 729 in 186 games. He also holds the record of most playoff games played without winning a Stanley Cup.
 * Number Retired : March 11, 2000. During the ceremony, the Capitals presented Hunter with one of the penalty boxes of the Capital Centre, the former arena.
 * November 28, 2011 : Hunter returned to the Capitals to replace Bruce Boudreau as head coach. The Capitals would make the second round of the playoffs that year before losing in game seven to the NY Rangers. On May 14, 2012, Hunter announced he would not return as head coach, choosing to return as coach of the London Knights, the OHL team he owns with his brother.

Outside of that we talked to some really awesome fans... our seating neighbors were pretty cool.  We heckled some folks wearing Leafs jerseys (playfully, ofc) much of the night, and some innocent people just wearing blue shits... managed to sneak in some Jim Beam and occasionally got the upper 413 section laughing pretty hard at our drunken antics.

### Season Series:

| Date | Score | 
:--: | :--: 
Mar 5 '13 | WAS 4-3 |


### Big story:

&gt; The Bruins will try to keep pace with Montreal and Pittsburgh for the top spot in the East while the Capitals need to keep winning just to stay on the fringes of the playoff chase.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Just as they were in the game against Boston, the Capitals were down early to the Carolina Hurricanes on Thursday night but rallied for a much-needed 3-2 win. Actually catching the Hurricanes -- Washington is 10 points back with 22 games to play -- is almost out of the question.
The Capitals are seven points shy of Winnipeg for eighth place in the East but have a game in hand. They also have two games against the Jets in as many nights next week, but they need to stay within striking distance between now and then and have road games at Boston and Pittsburgh with a home tilt against Buffalo in between.
Washington did get Tom Poti back against Carolina, but the defense remains wrecked with injuries. Steve Oleksy, who was a healthy scratch earlier this season in the American Hockey League, skated nearly 28 minutes Thursday night against the Hurricanes.


**[Bruins](/r/bostonbruins):**

&gt;Boston looks a lot like the team that won the Stanley Cup in 2011, which isn't good news for everyone else in the Eastern Conference. The Bruins are ninth in the League in goals per game and third in goals against. They are one of the top teams in the NHL at even strength, and they dominate possession thanks in part to a huge lead in faceoffs -- at 57.4 percent they are nearly four percent better points than second-place San Jose.
The only issue of late has been blown third-period leads. Boston is 10-2-1 in its past 13 games, and led all three of the losses in the final period. Besides the loss to Washington, the Bruins led Pittsburgh 2-0 before a three-goal flurry. They led Montreal 3-2 before a pair of goals.

### Players To Watch:
&gt; Mike Ribeiro and Nicklas Backstrom have seven points each in the past seven games for the Capitals. … Tyler Seguin has four goals in the past six games for the Bruins.

2008 - Took Philly to 7 games after the Boudreau miracle turnaround

2009 - Eliminated Rangers, took the eventual Stanley Cup Champ Penguins to 7 games

2010 - Lost to the Canadiens, admittedly a bad loss to take but we fell victim to the 'hot goalie' that every playoff year somehow brings. Penguins also lost to the Canadiens as well.

2011 - Eliminated Rangers, Lost to Lightning in 4 (the worst series IMO)

Other than the lightning, we have not really played poorly in playoff series, it just hasnt worked out the way we would have liked. so HAVE FAITH!",,False,self,t5_2rouz,False,,,True,t3_s13vp,http://www.reddit.com/r/caps/comments/s13vp/have_faith_playoff_caps_are_not_as_bad_as/,

I know that there are plenty of die-hard hockey fans out there that get frustrated with people who do not follow the sport so closely. However, I'm trying my best starting next season to follow not just the Caps, but hockey more intensely. 

I know the game play and what I'm watching every time I turn the games on, so that's not my problem. What I want to know are things like: What players do we need to take us to the next level? Is Alex Ovechkin still that good? Has George McPhee overstayed his welcome (like Ernie Grunfeld)? Is Oates the answer at head coach? What will it take for us to win a Cup?

I just want to expand my knowledge of the NHL, especially with the Caps. I'm hoping you guys can add some insight here and educate me. Thanks in advance!",,False,self,t5_2rouz,False,,,True,t3_1fa5on,http://www.reddit.com/r/caps/comments/1fa5on/casual_caps_fan_needs_help/,

Hi, folks. Mike Milbury here.  I want to take some time today to admit I have been completely wrong. Totally wrong. In the past, I have [said bad things](http://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/watch-mike-milbury-epic-alex-ovechkin-trashing-act-023336900--nhl.html) about Alex Ovechkin and his level of play. I’m here to clear that up. Alex Ovechkin is a hockey god and deserves the Rocket trophy.

In the past, I may have favored Steven Stamkos, because - let's face it - the kid looks like a 12 year old. It's hard not to like his goofy grin and he's certainly easier to understand than Ovechkin )))) But, I have to face reality. Stamkos kinda sucks this year. 2 goals in the last 5 games, man? Maybe he should take up professional [diving](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gwt5q-zH9VA) instead of hockey. At this point, St. Louis is gonna pass him for the Art Ross, too. Passed up by a 37 year old dwarf. Weaksauce, Stammer.

Ovechkin has proven himself able to overcome adversity. Like growing up wearing a [hideous jumpsuit](http://sid-best.tumblr.com/post/47207392162/ovie-at-school-chilling-in-an-american-flag) and an unfortunate love for the [Sabres](http://misterirrelevant.com/index.php/2011/05/31/alex-ovechkin-sabres-childhood-photo/). Along the way, he's mastered *more* than just the art of hockey. He's also learned to [golf](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wylmOGotyvY)! Maybe that explains why he was so slack the first half of the season. You can't tee off the puck, Ovi! I can't deny the turnaround, though. 5 goals in 5 games and an 8 game winning streak for his team. Oh, and the obligatory 'hot fiancee' comment goes here, too.


The bottom line is that Alex is working hard for the trophy and Stamkos isn't.  Maybe we're going to see a new Ovechkin that plays hard and doesn't throw a hissy fit everytime something go wrongs. There's no denying the league needs more adult players and fewer man-children (Looking at YOU Crosby) who can actually produce. So good on Ovi for the Rocket trophy and good luck to the Caps. Run away with the last 'Special Ed' Division title and show those Canadians how we do things SouthLeast style.",,False,self,t5_2rouz,False,,,True,t3_1cj8ej,http://www.reddit.com/r/caps/comments/1cj8ej/ovechkin_deserves_the_trophy/,
