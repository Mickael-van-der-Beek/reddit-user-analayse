You can see a ""normal"" animated sitcom like American Dad one second, then something completely bizarre and surreal like 12 Oz. Mouse the next. You can soak up the MTV-style antics of Loiter Squad, or the lo-fi deadpan comedy of Steve Brule. I guaran-fucking-tee you Comedy Central would never have shown anything like Perfect Hair Forever, the more absurd episodes of South Park notwithstanding.

Even better, they take risks with their own audience. In 2003 they gave a shot to a weird Johnny Quest homage, The Venture Bros., that’s still to this day the only animated show they’ve ever broadcast with both story arcs and real character development that follows the model of a traditional drama. When Tom Goes to the Mayor premiered in 2004, there was nothing close to it on the network. It was jarring visually and tonally, but it opened up at least some segment of the audience to a new type of comedy. In 2007 they let a show try something no other show had, obliterate it's own tried and true formula, when they broadcast Moral Orel’s “Nature” and the subsequent ultra-dark seasons that followed it.

I can understand distaste for some of the shows Adult Swim has aired. I honestly can’t stand Loiter Squad, but I also recognize it’s pretty unique right now on TV, and even better it pays the bills for the weirder shows Adult Swim airs later at night. And it’s precisely for those reasons that the hate against shows like Xavier and Tim and Eric is so disheartening to see. When you say you hate a whole category of shows like that, what you’re really saying is that you hate experimentation, you’re saying you hate what makes Adult Swim great and what separates it from the rest of boring TV. 

If you want to live in the past like Fry did when he found the anchovies can then you’re welcome to drop those sweatpants right now, watch Harvey Birdman and Brak Show reruns 24/7 on [All Kids Out of the Pool](http://www.allkidsoutofthepool.com/), and bitch on the Adult Swim forums like the other closed-minded fanboys. Hopefully the rest of us can enjoy what AS has become, and look forward to what they have in store for us in the future.

Your audience is more loyal than crack addicts... reward our dependency with more shows like:

* Venture Bros
* Harvey Birdman
* Oral (edit: Moral Oral)
* Robot Chicken
* Home Movies

I know that most of the production teams for the above mentioned shows have gone on to bigger things... good for them. But that just leaves more room for more talent. OC is the spice of life.

So it might be up to us 12 oz diehards to try and keep this venerable ritual alive and well.  

The plan has traditionally been to start a coordinated viewing starting at 2:22 EST.  Those taking part then meet up in the Adult Swim Central chat room and chat among ourselves. I am going to email the ASC folks to get their blessings (it shouldn't be a problem I imagine) and then hit up the the Adult Swim boards and make a post as well.  

I know there are at least a few of you who still love this show and would love to hear from you about any ideas as to how to promote this, or fun things to do during this.

You used to have one of the best streaming video sites out there. Long before hulu or even Netflix watch, you had a ton of episodes online. You promptly had new episodes online by Monday afternoon, often less than 12 hours since they first aired. It was incredible, set a wonderful standard, and made it so I didn't have to torrent your shows from myslpeen (remember them, adultswim only tracker from the golden days of bittorrent). 

Hell, I didn't even mind watching an occasional ad to help support you. Your service was so prompt and full of content I didn't care, it was incredible.

Then, maybe a year ago, you overhauled your video page. All of a sudden I couldn't search for video while watching an episode, pages took forever to load, and the amount of ads skyrocketed. I thought it was ok, but then you stopped uploading new shows promptly, first it was just or day or two, but then it went up to 3 or 4 days, or even a week. 

What the hell adult swim? What happened to your internet video service? Now I have to wait weeks to get new content. What caused this unnecessary update? I could stand the ads, I don't even mind the interface downgrade, but I can't wait to see new content. I need my new shows within 24 hours! You have utterly failed me, I have no interest in your content and i have returned to finding my adult swim fix through illicit means. 

I want to support you, I really do, but your new service sucks. It's slow, hard to use, and never has new content. I'm returning to the torrent world for my adult swim content and you are losing ad revenue, or whatever it is that you gain from my viewership. I wish I could support you, I really do, but I just can't wait for my shows.

Really bad. 

1. It's an hour a week.
2. It's not a Cartoon Network block, instead it's on a obscure movie channel that nobody really watches on a friday at midnight.
3. Anybody watching it wouldn't even be able to tell it's adultswim. There's no logo, no bumpers or anything, just the shows by themselves and that's it. The only reason I know it's adultswim is because the UK has an official facebook and twitter account that occasionally posts the schedule and that's about it. Even the person running is a bit down in the dumps about the current state of [as] UK.

It used to be pretty decent too. It was on every other day at 10-11pm for around 4 hours and played [as] classics like Space Ghost, Sealab, Harvey Birdman, Metalocalypse, 12oz Mouse, Brak Show etc and the bumpers were there and everything, I watched it religiously. Now it's just Robot Chicken, Metalocalypse and ATHF on occasion. The only thing I can really think of is making some sort of petition and trying to get people on the FB page to sign it or something.

-  What happened to the classic B&amp;W Viewer Cards?

Everything seems to be more social network-directed and a lot of what the block was built on has been left out or neglected over the multiple creative direction shifts. When Adult Swim started, facebook and twitter weren't even created yet, giving it that ""underground"" comedic edge. How do you think Adult Swim's focus on social networking has increased your popularity and what has it done for the long-time fans?

It scared me to death as a child, and scarred me mentally. I'll try to describe it and provide details as best I can.
It happened sometime during, or before 2006, cause my mom was alive.

Here's what I remember:

It started out with a kid in school. Like, highschool age. I remember him being followed and watched by two men in black suits. Like it was something from the Matrix. I don't remember what exactly happened, but it led to human enslavement by robots. They kept humans in these pods and killed them ruthlessly. 

I know this was on Adult Swim because I stayed up watching Family Guy and Toonami came on. It had to have been around 12 or 1 A.M., and it was an Anime. It was bloody as shit and I remember being terrified the days afterwards. 

I also know it had to be Adult Swim because I only watched Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network growing up, and I never watched Nickelodeon at night, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim were just too awesome.

Pleaseeeeeeee help. If you know of something that I'm talking about, give me some pointers on what to Google. I've tried Googling everything I remember, but I just can't find anything. Any ideas?

Mouse-""They're about...the end........and fragments of the beginning... and there's meat.""
Shark-""Am-am I in them?""
Mouse-""They're crazy-""
Shark-""Mmm. Are they episodic, or just one long?-
Mouse-""What's that supposed to mean, episodic?!""
Shark-""Are they segmented, er-""
Mouse-""Why in the hell would you think they're segmented?""
Shark-""I'm not saying they are. They're your dreams.""
Mouse-""Yes... they are my dreams.*angry* They're mine.*anxious* For my head.""
Shark-""Well, then, only you would know how to describe them.""
Mouse-""Well, that's what I'm trying to do, but it seems you keep trying to do that for me.
Shark-""Do what?""
Mouse-""Describe the dreams""
Shark-""Well then, describe them.""
Mouse-""*looks suspiciously at the clock as it slides*...Describe what?*careful whisper*""
Shark-""The one's you're having, or not having them now.... Suddenly."" 
Mouse-""You're trying to make me have them?... For me?""

Mouse-""I think you should know when to stop helping me."" 
Shark-""I'm never finished helping eeeeverybody.*slides closer to mouse, mouse looks uneasy*""

...Mouse has long since gone insane. He is very, very delusional. I noticed, for once, it's always mouse who acts uneasy at thing's, and the clock slides are only noticed by him. He might be an alcoholic schizophrenic, or an alcoholic bi-polar, etc etc. Either way, he's psychotic. He thinks he is a secret agent with enemies; shark might be his psychologist, square might be a guardian, woman might be a receptionist/nurse or etc, the rest might have been his drinking buddies/exacerbators of his condition. And with either Rooster or Shadowy Figure being aspects of himself. He is paranoid and afraid everybody; there is not one scene he thinks something is after, solely, him.
I'm watching a scene right now where shark offers him aspirin for his headache. He doesn't act suspicious or anything, but mouse doesn't trust him. The aspirin procedes to sprout skeleton faces, asking, ""Something the matter?""""""

I'm a Dino fan. I was before I even knew who the guy was and what he had worked on, when I enjoyed stuff that I later found out he had written/produced. 

To start with, Blanket buying the bar is a good thing so long as we don't get a supersaturation of Long Island Iced Teas, bro.
The little bits were really appreciated, like Victor's wife offering genital mutilation as an incentive and Polidori losing his arms.
Some elements of the episode could have been explored a bit more, but that's typical for a 15 minute runtime.. there's going to be bits that you wished to have seen more of.
We did get a bit more of the Creature than usual, which was fun. Nothing new with him, but what we got was quality emotion.
Dr. Moreau's introduction to the show could provide a lot of interesting plot points... ever read The Island of Dr. Moreau? That dude is f'ed up.
The end with Polidori's chicken hand was just about the only part that I thought was out of place.

So, the first episode of Frankenhole Season 2? Good stuff.
