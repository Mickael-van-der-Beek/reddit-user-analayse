So collectively the moderators here have decided that we want to make some changes regarding the direction of our favorite subreddit. So this is probably going to be the first of a few posts made under this account. You may or may not have noticed this account but basically if you see this account post you need to give it visibility. Self posts aren't worth Karma anyway and we need this stuff to really be at the top of the sub. So really there is no reason not to click the little purple up arrow friend. 

TOPICS we need to discuss include:

* Flair - Flair update is incoming but suggestions will be welcome. This ones pretty straightforward. 

* What to do about Memes / Dog Pictures / Victory spamming - The general consensus here is that we are concerned with the growth of our sub and if it really can handle the volume of some of the recurring topics. There are many solutions to this but we want to hear what you guys think about the pace at which these posts appear here. The general solution we have come up with so far is to have more weekly threads for some of these things. How heavily you want that moderated is up to you guys.

* General attitude - For the most part we are really quite good about things but there is still room for improvement. This place should really encourage the celebration and fandom of our favorite football team. It should not be about whining about other teams and other subreddits. Stop responding to the trolls. Stop downvoting opinions you don't agree with. As long as we all bleed purple we should only downvote things that are irrelevant to our celebration of all that is the Ravens.

* Anything else you want to discuss go ahead and discuss here. Remember we are very very open to your opinion. If you want us to make threads shitting on the browns every week we'll gladly help direct this redundancy... though all kidding aside we want to hear from **you**!

After some discussion we may or may not vote on some things, so please stay alert.",,False,,t5_2s1w8,False,,,True,t3_1842x3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/1842x3/changes_are_coming_and_we_want_your_involvement/,moderator

A team that poured its heart and soul into that game and their opponents never stood a chance. 

Playing you guys is scary every year, but from this year on, as scary as it surely still will be... It will never quite be the *same* without Ray Lewis. Our rivalry in the AFC is like mini Superbowls for me every time we meet. In the closing seconds of last nights game, the heaviness I felt in my heart knowing that our season has come to an end was overpowered by a small light. Secretly, amongst all of us Pats fans at the bar, a quietness fell amongst us as they showed Lewis in all of his emotion. And silently we all agreed that we were happy for him. And a slow clap filled the bar. 

For this years Superbowl, I will don a #52 Baltimore Ravens Ray Lewis jersey in addition to my patriots hat. Why? Because as much trash as we talk as fans to one another. As heated as our rivalry becomes at some points. As much as I believe there is a mutual fear that we share for one another. Above all that, I believe there is a respect unmatched in other rivalries in the NFL. 

Ray Lewis has been the cornerstone of a defense in the AFC that is the yin to our offenses yang. As much as it pains me to have my Superbowl hopes dashed, I will be rooting so hard for you guys in the big game. Because Ray Lewis is the best damn linebacker to ever set foot on a football field, and he deserves to retire a god damn champion. 

From a lifelong Patriots fan. Go purple and black! Go Ray Ray! And go fucking Ravens!!! 

**TL;DR:** I'm a Pats fan who will be rooting for you guys in the big game while wearing a Lewis jersey out of sheer respect! Go Ravens! ",,False,,t5_2s1w8,False,,,True,t3_1700t0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/1700t0/from_a_lifelong_patriots_fan_to_everyone_at/,

I am a Texans fan and my number #2 team in the AFC the Ravens. Now you can downvote me if you want thats fine. But I just ask one thing from you.. lets make sure the Pats/Steelers dont make it past us in the playoffs. Please note I dont speak for all Texans fans.. just myself when I say that. 

Side note: I know you had a tough loss today just like we did last week but I think you are being too hard on yourselves. You are a great team with half of fame players and you WILL make it to the playoffs. Dont let one loss bring you down. Good luck!

Christmas was coming up in a few months so I jokingly hinted at it for a gift. Now, before I go any further I need to tell you a little bit about my mom. While I was growing up we never had much money, and my parents weren't married, but every Christmas I would wake up to PILES of presents, because all my mom cared about was making sure I was happy. Years later I found out that she wouldn't pay her bills in november and december to get me more than I even asked for. She would even sit and watch football games with me, even though she hated football. Now, back to the conversation at hand. My mom and girlfriend had a conversation about the jersey after I had left the room and they were going to go half and half on it because neither had enough to get it on their own. 

But my mom passed away in early November, while visiting my brother out of state. Obviously it was a rough time, for my entire family and everyone that knew her. Well, a month or so pass and Christmas comes around, and to my surprise I open a gift and see this jersey in there, and, in my girlfriends handwriting, a note that says ""Merry Christmas, love Mom."" It is the best gift I have ever gotten, and the Jersey means so much to me. I have worn that jersey every game this post season, and it has a perfect record so far(I was working during the Cinci game, so I didn't get to wear it). I know Lewis says that God is helping the Ravens out, but part of me thinks my mom is up there at his side, watching the games just like she did with me. 

I know this story won't mean as much to you guys, but I wanted to tell her story, and mine. ",,False,,t5_2s1w8,False,,original2flair,True,t3_17i5k9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/17i5k9/a_story_close_to_my_heart_and_one_i_want_to_share/,

I don't live in New Orleans these days, but I was living there when the Saints had their very first winning season after 20 years of futility.  You could feel it in the city.  The whole town was elated.  When they went to the Super Bowl, it was electrifying.  The city of New Orleans was planning to throw the Saints a party even if the Saints lost.

Listening to the various Ravens talk about Baltimore on post-game interviews and talk shows and the like, and listening to various Baltimoreans talk about the Ravens, it sounds like Baltimore and the Ravens have the same sort of relationship that New Orleans has with the Saints.

Someone introduced me to Madden, for some reason I picked them....probably had something to do with the fact that they were the best team in the game and I was 8.  I flopped over a couple times as I actually became cognizant of what football was, but after briefly having good feelings for shitty Oakland and cheating New England, I realized how disgusting that was and came back to like Baltimore and their elite defense within 2 years.

You may think that a kid from LA doesn't know much about football, but here I am, streaming every Ravens game possible for the past 7 years or so, playing fantasy football and grabbing Balt D and Ray Rice every year.

Irrelevant background information aside, the point is I have watched Baltimore play for a while now.  I've been there for all the ups and the downs, from Kyle Boller/Anthony Wright/Chris Redman to Steve McNair to Joe Flacco, Billick to Harbaugh, the days where McAlister/Baxter/Boulware were key names on our defense, you name it.  There has been a shit ton of change on our team.  You think we haven't progressed and got by?  I'd argue that for being a consistently good team, we are perhaps the most consistent in shredding a fundamental aspect and changing it.  I see this as a great quality.  Rather than having complete turnovers where we have to wait 10 years for our franchise to turn a new leaf like the Raiders/Lions and what not, we weed out the aging players (McAlister, Johnson, Scott) to make room for new ones (Webb, Kruger, McClain).  It still takes time, but these subtle changes save us from years of torment rather than maybe 1 or 2 games we toss in a season.

When I read the news on Suggs this morning, I felt bad, but I wasn't worried about our season.  Not at all.  Our front office is the best of the league, the cream of the crop.  We find stability in chaos.  That is how the Ravens have worked and always have.

After the heartbreak last year, I know there is a lot of fuel resting in many players hearts.  We have many high profile players on both sides of the ball -- the thing is, they aren't divas and they don't whine for attention.  They just sit back, and they let the fire burn in them.  They put in their work, and they progress behind the scenes, out of the view of the leagues eyes.

When it comes down to it, yeah, we lost a dominant pass rusher for the season.  Terrell Suggs will be on the sideline.  We lost depth - bye bye Zibby, bye bye Nakamura; we lost consistency - see ya later Grubbs, have fun in SD Jarret.  But what we didn't lose is experience or new blood.  Lewis and Birk and Reed aren't retiring.  Boldin is still here.  Torrey, Flacco, Rice, Webb are all rising stars.  Yanda is a Pro Bowler.  Oher had his slip ups, but he's in a locker room that is going to get him up again, I'm sure of it.

Last year we signed guys like McKinnie who we weren't sure could fill a void that big.  Let's face it, we haven't had a dominant LT since Ogden.  But he still did a decent enough job to make our line stable enough.

In a couple of weeks, our guys are gonna put in work.  Our guys are gonna go to training camp, become better players and an even more unified team in the process.  As long as we have leaders like Lewis and Reed, we will continue to do this.  And even after they're gone, they're passing the torch to people like Suggs, Webb, Rice, and Flacco who look to take over as leaders for years to come.

We have talent on our roster.  Don't be afraid.  Suggs does leave a void, but it's time for Kindle, Upshaw, and Kruger to step up anyways.  In a way, I see it as a blessing in disguise - not for Suggs or our defense, but for our young guys.  This will ensure they get their experience and playing time to become better players in the future.

Don't worry.  We won't miss a beat.  There is still Lewis, Reed, Ngata, Webb  holding the defense strong in each facet.

We will compete and see how the season goes.  In the end, the way it turns out is not gonna be because of Suggs.  1 player doesn't make a team.  Let's just worry about finishing up and getting the Lombardi to Baltimore.

I understand that its Ray's last Ride, and truthfully, I doubt that we would be in this position without the ""do it for Ray"" mentality, but even more than that, we've seen the lanky-ass, much maligned QB that we all know and love (well not all of us have loved) evolve from a Magikarp  into a Gyarados over the course of a few weeks. Or in plain-speak, we've witnessed ""the Leap"" from Flacco. 

We cannot ignore or understate the fact that Flacco has been putting up numbers that are becoming frighteningly close to Johnny U, the greatest QB Baltimore has ever seen. And perhaps the spirit of Johnny U has been guiding Flacco ever since the start of the Mile High Miracle where he lead the Ravens to win one of the greatest post-season games ever played. 

We weren't supposed to be here. We were supposed to lose to the Indianapolis Chuckstrongs led by the unflappable Andrew Luck; We were supposed to be massacred by the most balanced team in the NFL, a team that humiliated us at our house; We were supposed to crumble under the wake of the unstoppable New England Tom Bradys. 

But we didn't. Why you ask? 

Because Joe Flacco, thats why. 

Because Joe Flacco decided that enough was enough. Because he understood that this was the year to make ""The Leap"", that this was the year he became the General of the Ravens, whether he wanted to or not. Because he understood that this was the difference between being Elite or forever in the ""Joe Fluck-o"" category of QB's. 

Yes, the Defense has been playing out of its mind these past weeks. Yes, you cannot overstate how important the ""win it for Ray"" momentum has been for the team. This year's Ravens is not the most talented team we've ever had, it's been the most united. But for as good as the Defense has played: 9 points for Luck, 21 for Manning, 13 for Tom Brady, this has been Flacco's year. 

Without Flacco, sure we would have beaten the Indianapolis Chuckstrongs, they were a team running on nothing but fairy magic since Pagano came down with leukemia, (an aside: Thank God that Pagano has fully recovered and is able to coach again. I have nothing but respect and admiration for him as a coach and as a man) they were in the playoffs two years too early to compete for the AFC championship. 

But Flacco proved his worth in Mile High, against Peyton Manning and the vaunted Broncos, overcoming a special teams disaster and insurmountable odds. That was the day that the spirit of Johnny U decided to play QB for Baltimore once again, with Flacco through sheer willpower alone carrying the team, refusing to let them lose this one. Last year's Ravens would have been decimated, last year's Flacco wouldn't have been able to win that game. 

But this year was different. With 30 seconds left, Joe dodged Von Miller, the sack-artist who was supposed to make his life hell, and throw the most important pass of his career, the greatest pass in Raven's history, a dragon of a pass that fooled everyone with its height and distance. And who but Jacoby Jones, who exorcised his own playoff demons and yips, caught the ball. 

Against the Patriots, Flacco was unstoppable. Flacco was brilliant. In the second half, he made Tom Brady look mediocre and average, the roles were reversed. It was Flacco moving effortlessly downfield, picking apart the Patriots secondary like it was just another day of Practice. 

Flacco's thrown for 853 yards this postseason, at 9.17 Yards per attempt, with 8 TD's and 0 Int's and a 114.7 Rating.  

All other quarterbacks to throw at least 8 TD's with 0 Int's in the playoffs won Super Bowl MVP. Flacco is in elite company, up there with the likes Montana, Young, Aikman, Simms and Drew Brees. 

But Drew Brees didn't have his incredible postseason run on the road, Flacco did.

Steve Young and Brees never won a road postseason game, Flacco has won 6. 

In fact, the only Quarterback to have a comparable post season road record is Eli Manning, who has won 5 games. 

Flacco's postseason record is now 8-4, making Peyton Manning's 9-11 record look pedestrian by comparison. With one more win, he will have matched Peyton Manning's playoff wins.

Let that sink in: Joe Flacco is one win away from matching Peyton Manning's career playoff wins. Manning playoff suckitude debate aside, this is incredible.

Flacco's 2013 postseason run has been legendary. There. I said it. The man is 3 TD's away from tying Montana's 11 TD's. 3 more TD's and he will have tied Montana for the greatest postseason run ever.

Let's take a step back: 

Joe Montana. 

Joe Flacco. 

In the same god damn sentence.

Joe Flacco has a chance to match and surpass Montana for the greatest postseason run ever. He has tied Brees, Simms, Aikman with 8 TD's. He is one away from Steve Young's 9.

But the stats are skewed in the new pass-happy NFL Zangestu, those records will be shattered in no time. 

Then why is Drew Brees the only QB in this company in the last 20 odd years? Because pass-happy aside, throwing 0 interceptions is difficult. 

Joe Flacco's 2013 post-season run has been Legen...

wait for it.


Dary.

This may be pre-mature considering we have yet to play the Super Bowl, but Flacco has more than earned his new contract, more than earned the approval of Ravens fans everywhere. He is our QB. Joe's our man and he will continue to be our man for years to come. He's earned it. 

One more bud. My jersey and my body are ready. 60 minutes from glory, 60 minutes away from becoming a legend. 

It's our time. Now unleash the Dragon.

Both QBs felt special, indeed, and walked up to their red,white,blue,&amp; orange houses. As Peyton and Tom started to sit on their new porches Peyton hollas over to Tom did you notice the house just around the corner, Tom said yeah. It was a 3 story mansion with a Purple and Black sidewalk, a 50 foot tall flagpole with an enormous Raven logo flag, and in every window, a Raven towel. Peyton and Tom looked at GOD and said, “GOD, we not trying to be ungrateful, but we have a question. Being all pro QBs, holding many NFL records, plus Super Bowl wins.” GOD interupted, ""So what’s your point Peyton , Tom ?"" ""Well, why does Ray Lewis get a better house than us?""

Ever since I was little I was raised to hate you, I was raised to despise you and your son of a bitch former owner, Art Modell. You embody the team that took our beloved Browns away, and took all our success with you. You took our rivalry with Pittsburgh, you took it all.

But there's something about you guys. I don't know if it's that you are the real Browns that I was told about from yesteryear, or if it's that you guys are just awesome... but, as much as I despise it, I like you guys. I secretly root for you guys. I almost bought a Ravens jersey, granted it WAS a Troy Smith jersey, but I almost bought one.

I don't know if it's that I like seeing you fight Pittsburgh, or if it's that you guys look evil in your black and purple, but I can never honestly say I hate Baltimore. 

Anyways, good luck to you guys against the Patriots. If you get to the Super Bowl, bring the trophy back to the AFC North, at least it makes me feel like my team is getting beat up by the hardest divisional opponents in the NFL. 

Sincerely, with secret support,
A Cleveland Browns fan.",,False,,t5_2s1w8,False,,brownsflair,True,t3_oidhk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/oidhk/im_a_browns_fan_i_have_something_i_need_to_say/,

As has been stated countless times, this is not the first time we've ""lost free agency,"" nor is it the first time we've cut or elected not to resign some fan favorites, and it will not be the first time we've gone out and been one of the top teams in the league the following season regardless.

News flash: Making a splash in free agency doesn't necessarily lead to becoming a force in the league.  Before somebody brings up the Heat, that's a five-player-per-team sport, and the LeBron we're seeing since the Pacers series last year would be winning multiple titles with or without Wade and Bosh.  Consider the other evidence:

* 2012 Los Angeles Angels: Acquire Albert Pujols and C. J. Wilson in free agency.  Acquire Zach Greinke at the trade deadline.  Miss the playoffs.
* 2012 Detroit Tigers: Acquire Prince Fielder in free agency.  Prince + Miguel = let's just call the season off and award them the trophy in January.  The Tigers end up with the 7th best AL record (out of 14 teams) despite playing a large portion of their games against a dogshit division, and only make playoffs and advance because said dogshit division allows them to rest up and have Verlander go twice in the opening series.  
* 2011 Philadelphia Eagles: Do I need to explain this one? Dream Team and such.  Miss playoffs both years, fire coach, cut the biggest piece of the free agency ""splash"" that was supposed to enshrine them as the next dynasty.
* 2012-13 Los Angeles Lakers: Kobe and Dwight and Pau and Steve Nash? This game isn't fair let's just have another lockout. I guess I could end up being wrong about this but I can't see anything but a 7- or 8-seed and first-round exit happening.

The common theme to all of these failures is letting present emotions dictate long-term decisions.  I love Ed Reed, but would you rather have him for at least $6M or someone 95% as good and much younger for $2-3M or less?  Ozzie is smart enough to know that flexibility and staying competitive in the future is more important than sentiment.  

So yes, you will read articles in the coming days or weeks about how the Ravens ""lost the offseason,"" and how we're destined to miss the playoffs.  Try not to lower yourself to the level of the people writing those things.  I realize that sports are all about overreacting, but calmer heads always prevail.  Ozzie is the best in the business, he's done this before, and he will do it again.  

I only ask that after we make a deep playoff run again this year while the Dolphins and Browns watch from the golf course, you try not to overreact again next March when we refuse to re-sign Ihedigbo for $10M/year because he had a pick in the 2014 Super Bowl.",,False,,t5_2s1w8,1363349928.0,,73,True,t3_1acguv,http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/1acguv/to_all_the_newly_acquired_fans_yes_this_is_how_we/,

It feels amazing. I'm from Oregon, but have been a Ravens fan since I was 10 and really began watching football. I love the NFL because you can follow a player's entire career, and if you're lucky, your favorite player will have a solid tenure with your team.

I am a Ravens fan because of Ed Reed. Ed Reed is, in my opinion, the greatest free safety of all time. Ed Reed became my favorite player, and as such, the Ravens became my favorite team. Of course, Ray was already there, but since then, the Ravens have added Haloti (from my hometown UofO), Sizzle, Anquan, Bernard Pollard... Even though great players have left, my favorites have stayed. This is why I love the NFL.

Anyway, it just finally hit me that Ray is leaving. After giving the franchise 17 years of his life, and giving me an amazing team to follow through my childhood, he is leaving his city after giving them one last victory, this time in the Super Bowl. The story could not have been more eloquently written, even by Mr. Poe himself . As this team ages and younger players emerge, I will never forget the first time I saw Ray Lewis play, or the day I say Ed Reed take an interception back out of his own endzone. I love this team. I love these players. I love this game.

As we move forward as a team, I'm optimistic that there will always be a little bit of Ray left in the team's locker room. A great player like him will never truly be gone, and I hope that #52's presence will always be felt on the field. Thank you Ray for everything you have given this franchise.

1362231479.0,57,self.ravens,19irz9,First Take: Why Flacco and the Ravens won with this contract. ,Zangestu,64,7,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/19irz9/first_take_why_flacco_and_the_ravens_won_with/,"/r Ravens, let me tell you why this contract for Flacco is the best news we've heard all season. We just made a huge step forward for next season, and with the Flacco contract finished, we can unleash the Wizard of Oz on the off-season. 

Joe is a smart guy, he understands that in order for his team to be as competitive as possible, he needs to structure in such a way that he will give the Ravens a competitive edge in player negotiations and building the best team they can. Flacco was handed the keys to the team by Ray, ""You're the General now."" Ray told him before the game in Denver where Flacco lead the Ravens to their single greatest postseason victory, the most memorable play in team history, and one of the greatest upsets in NFL history. Flacco led, and the Ravens followed to a massive victory.

But ""Nooo...he's such an average QB."" This is the sort of crap I've been hearing since the post seasons began. ""Flacco and the Ravens didn't play well, his opponents just played badly.If the 49ers had played better then they would have will  the Super Bowl. if the Patriots had played better they would have won the AFC Championship Game. If the Broncos had played better, they would have won the Divisional Round...""

Get over it, the Ravens won on the arm of Flacco and their offense in every game this post season, and many more during the regular reason. And we saw clearly in the playoffs if you give him more than 1.5 seconds to throw in the pocket he'll tear a defense apart. Watch tape of his games in the regular season where he struggled, his offensive line was absolute garbage in those games. 

When the Ravens lose, it's all on Flacco. When the Ravens win, he was carried by an ""elite"" D which played the worst it ever had, and a rushing attack that sputtered and stalled. 

Next year, we're going to see all sorts of fans showering accolades of Rogers and Ryan for their mega-contracts, praising them as the best QBs in the league. And while they both are pretty great, poor Joe Flacco who has matched Rogers in Super Bowls and MVPs and has as many Super Bowl MVP awards as Ryan has playoff wins will be lambasted. 

I laugh at the jealous fans who wish they had Flacco as their QB and a team like the Ravens. I laugh at fans in the league who just like big regular season numbers and contending for the playoffs, fans that aren't used to contending for Super Bowls every year like Flacco and the Ravens have. Since Flacco and Harbs joined the team, we've been in the playoffs 5 years, in the AFC Championship Game 3 years, and won the Super Bowl now once. That's the highest level of excellence in the league, and we can't let Patriots fans, Bronco fans, Atlanta fans, Green Bay fans, and other teams who try to mock our team as ""has been, can't do.""

Since 2008, and Flacco came into the league and came to the Ravens, NO other team has the playoff excellence the Ravens have had. And with Flacco at the helm, we'll be in this position for the next 10 years.
