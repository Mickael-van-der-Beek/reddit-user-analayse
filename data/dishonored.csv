I don't know if anyone has posted anything similar to this, but if they have, my bad for reposting it.

Anyways, I've just started my third playthrough of the game.  My first was a ghost/low chaos and my second was basically the Inigo Montoya archetype wherein I just obliterated everything in my path.  So, for my third playthrough, I disabled all the UI elements and I've incorporated one of my favorite parts of the game - the Heart - into my modus operandi.

Basically, if you don't know this already, the Heart has two functions other than locating runes and bone charms - it can give you intimate details about either the location you are in, or an NPC you have targeted.  When using it on an NPC, I found that the little Heart snippits were often focused on revealing the morals and intentions of the person you're targeting.  (For example, for one guard I targeted, the Heart said something like, ""He eats very well every night, even though his family doesn't.""  For another, it said, ""He is the only one in his family who has not been taken by the plague."")

So basically, for most NPCs that I come across, I use the Heart as a form of judgement on them.  I'll listen to one or two secrets about them and based on what they reveal about that NPC, I will decide to either kill him, or knock him out and stash him somewhere safe.

It's a pretty gripping way to play the game because it really immerses me in the gameplay.  I am constantly making judgement calls regarding whether these people should live or die and it brings me closer to the characters, so it's pretty cool.  Just thought I'd share.",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,True,t3_11inb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/11inb3/an_interesting_playthrough_that_im_doing_right/,

**Prologue, Intro**

* As the capital city, Dunwall is home to the Empress and the royal court.
* Use your right hand to attack or block with a sword. 
* Use your left hand for powers, ranged weapons and gadgets.
* Blocking during sword combat protects you and can put enemies off-balance.
* Timed right, blocking a sword attack will throw your attacker off-balance.
* The Overseers are a militant religious faction spread across the Empire.
* Attack an off-balance or downed enemy to deliver a fatal strike.
* Sprint to evade enemies or build speed for jumps. 
* High Overseer Campbell is the current leader of the Abbey of the Everyman.
 
**Dishonored, Prison**

* Destroy any enemy in your path or adopt a stealthier approach.
* Go into stealth mode to sneak past enemies or approach them covertly.
* When facing too many attackers, move away and deal with them one-on-one.
* Leaning out from behind cover gives you a chance to watch your enemies and eavesdrop on them. As long as your body is behind cover, you won't be visible.
* A high body count leads to more rats, more plague victims and a darker outcome.
* Blocking is a critical part of combat.
* Save your game often.
 
**Dishonored, Sewer**

&gt;  Sure, you didn't really have to watch, but taking a playful approach can result in even more supernatural fun. Blow bottles off a shelf from a hidden perch to terrify the maids. Snatch a painting while a guard is looking at it instead of waiting for him to walk away. Throw a corpse off a balcony onto a guard, but freeze time before it hits, so you can watch his reaction when you appear in front of him as he gets clobbered from above. Dishonored has multiple save slots available, and taking advantage of the ability to tear things up and then reload a fresh start encourages you to engage in some absolutely delightful mayhem.

&gt; Yet even though it allows you to wipe the recent slate clean, Dishonored still begs to be replayed from the beginning. Unlocking different powers, finishing missions in different ways, striving to be more or less murderous, and seeing a different endgame all offer appealing incentives to give it another go. It's a rare game that feels so compulsively replayable, but Dishonored is such a game. The compelling abilities, the bold artistic design, the colorful characters, and above all, the freedom of choice--these are the things that mark Dishonored as one of the truly remarkable games of this year. 

**[The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/10/8/3470486/dishonored-review)** 9/10

&gt; Dishonored succeeds, despite its late narrative missteps. With everything against it, Arkane has created a game with a unifying vision and design that stands apart from its contemporaries as something different. But more importantly, Dishonored succeeds as an ambitious game not content to take one thing and do it well. It demands more than most games ever will of its player, and gives more to players than most other games will ever manage.

**[Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dishonored/b/xbox360/archive/2012/10/07/dishonoredreview.aspx)** 8.75/10

&gt; Though I was frustrated by the chaos system and how it steers your actions, the heart of Dishonored is about being inventive, adaptable, and ruthless. The team at Arkane Studios has injected an array of cool possibilities into the simulated city of Dunwall, and discovering them all is a blast. When you come face-to-face with the people who wronged you, your only dilemma is deciding which poetic method of elimination will produce coolest result.

**[GamesRadar](http://www.gamesradar.com/dishonored-review/)** 4.5/5

&gt; Dishonored combines a beautiful, stylized world filled with colorful characters, and gameplay freedom to form a fantastic adventure that you will want to revisit again and again. The open-style missions--combined with the weapons and abilities--make a thrilling playground to explore, tough enemies present a significant challenge, and the multiple outcomes, characters, and setting create an exhilarating world to discover. Dishonored is a game that you won’t want to miss.

**[The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/9961-Dishonored-Review)** 5/5

&gt; Dishonored gives you a beautiful, fascinating, new world to explore, and then makes it your playground for grand misdeeds. Its story of political intrigue and betrayal is told at exactly the right pace, balancing information with action in a way that keeps you interested, but not overloaded. Dishonored is smart enough to know not to try too hard to impress you, and as a result, it will blow you away.

**[G4](http://www.g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/65646/dishonored/review)** 4/5

&gt; Even if you didn’t know that Arkane Studios was comprised of folks whose resumes include such acclaimed series as BioShock, Half-Life, Thief, and Deus Ex, you would be hard pressed to not immediately think of these franchises after taking one look at Dishonored in action, and rightfully so. And while it has a few quirks here and there, Dishonored delivers on almost every admirably/crazily ambitious promise made by its creators. It’s impeccably crafted gameplay and exquisitely haunting and detailed world stand in loving tribute to all of the iconic and acclaimed franchises that inspired it, and yet it still has a soul and style all its own. So if you feel like getting lost in a hypnotic world and engaging in a healthy amount of sword/magic-based badassery, do the honorable thing, and play this game immediately.

**[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-dishonored-236085.phtml)** 9/10

&gt; Dishonored is that game of 2012. It's the big intellectual property that comes to retail and shows up the competition by being bold, original, and -- more importantly -- brilliant. Easily deserving of its place among the BioShocks and the Borderlandses, Arkane's aggressive, non-aggressive, unsubtle, sneaky, thoroughly versatile tale of intrigue makes for the kind of game that reminds us this generation isn't all straightforward shooters and ""me too"" trend-seekers. Its level design is some of the very best, its willingness to let the player decide their own path is exhilarating, and the satisfaction gleaned from a mission well done leaves one hungry for more.

**[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/08/dishonored-review)** 9.2/10

&gt; It's a shame that Dishonored's story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts, but its gameplay absolutely is. Each mission is built as an elaborate network of choices for players to explore, and the same can be said for Corvo himself. Each player's selection of powers, perks and other upgrades will inform how they see and interact with this world, and no two play-throughs will be exactly the same. Dishonored is a game you'll talk with your friends about, and that you'll want to play multiple times. In this game there are always other paths to be taken and other challenges to conquer, and that's a refreshing thing indeed.

**[Gametrailers](http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/m68kgw/dishonored-review)** 8.7/10

&gt; “Dishonored” gives use a big patch of world for use to explore, secrets to uncover, people to kill or spare, and many ways to go about it all. It’s an interesting and often invigorating experience; a stealth game not weighted down by genre conventions ; a first person shooter where you don’t have to fire a shot and where jumping won’t cause you pull your hair out. But the intricacy of all it’s moving parts makes it’s quirks and blemishes all the more damming. With a tweaked plot, more thoughtful and varied pacing and better sword play to match the brilliance of Blink, “Dishonored” would be a classic, instead of merely being excellent.

**[CVG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUfe67noLcY)** 9.5/10

&gt; The one thing I took away from it is the more patience you show in game, the more you're prepared to delve around the catacombs and really explore, the more it rewards you. So it's just a great game to kick back and just spend some quality time with.

&gt; ...

&gt; There's some great games games out this winter. Hitman and Assassin's Creed 3 particularly look great. But this is just, like, a once in a generation sort of game. A real epic. And sort of the sort of thing you don't get too much of now. It seems to be everything is blowing into a more action, adventure type thing, where they've dumbed it down for the mass market. This is sort of like a real gamers game.

**[Shacknews](http://www.shacknews.com/article/76096/dishonored-review-story-driven-role-playing#)**

&gt; And for that reason, Arkane Studios' Dishonored is a great RPG. My emotions drove my style of game play as the bodyguard Corvo, falsely accused of killing a beloved Empress and my friend. I started with the mindset that clearing my name was secondary to finding those that killed her and kidnapped her daughter, the future monarch that I had watched grow up in my time as their bodyguard. I began play in a non-lethal fashion, fully unaware that what I was about to experience went well beyond the traditional point-and-click RPGs.

&gt; ...

&gt; But minor flaws aside, by the time the end credits rolled, I was emotionally exhausted and simultaneously stunned that a game could change the way I have always played. Dishonored is that rare RPG that takes the best of suspense novels and action movies and crafts them into the interactive experience. There is no need for number crunching or debates over ideal character builds. It is role-playing at its story-driven finest and Arkane has created an RPG formula worth emulating.

Good examples would be the ones in the pcgamer [""Three extreme approaches""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=rQ22nBdeugY&amp;feature=endscreen) -video. These offer interesting twists to the gameplay along with (somewhat) realistic explanations to them.

Here's a quick rundown on them:

**What a weird dream. Oh well, guess it was nothing** - ""Corvo is a man who escaped from prison, had a dream about a flying goth guy, woke up with a tattoo and then never thought about it ever again. This is a Corvo who has no idea he has magic powers and who presumably suspects that the heart in his pocket is an elaborate practical joke""

* No magic allowed; no active or passive powers, no runes, no bonecharms. All supernatural assistance is disallowed.

**Oh dear, what a terrible accident** - ""You want to commit the perfect crime, and that means leaving no trace, and no evidence that an external agent was ever involved. This means no sword and no crossbow, because stabwounds and protruding bolts are clear evidence of Corvo's presence. You're not allowed to choke guards unconcious because when they wake up they'd remember being attacked. Everything has to look like an accident.""

* Ghost, no being detected at any time
* No weapons allowed
* No knocking anyone uncouncious either  
* Powers like devouring swarm are allowed (in a city filled with rats, who's gonna suspect a wizard did it?)

**Corvo Attano, the loudest man in Dunwall** - ""Screw stealth, this is about swordfighting every single person who stands in your way. The twist is you have to duel fairly, and this means they have to see you coming. That means no aerial assassinations, no backstabs, no crossbow and no lethal use of powers. Instead, you should pistol-fire a warning shot and loudly announce your presence by making a spectacular entrance, preferably involving an explosion""

* No crossbow, the pistol may only be used to warn enemies of your presence
* No killing enemies that are unaware of your presence
* Powers may only be used to ensure duels are fair (disposing enemy grenades/bullets using bend time)

****

Inspired, I came up with a few of my own:

**Easy mode:**

**Karma** - Corvo is the embodiment of Karma, and wishes to also avenge the suffering of others than himself. Whenever there is time, he listens to what the heart says about citizens and punishes those who have done wrong (ironically if possible).

* Just what it sounds like; guards and citizens that are said to have killed other should be killed, a guard who beats his son should be beaten and a courtesan that knowingly spreads the plague is to be disposed of.

**Hard mode:**

**Lucky Luke** - Being the fastest and best gunslinger to ever walk the earth, Corvo refuses to use anything but ranged weapons. As the good guy, he never shoots first and prefers knocking enemies out over killing them. His incredible speed is a supernatural gift, and he does not posess other powers.

* No sword, only crossbow and pistol allowed  
* No attacking unaware enemies, they must act threatening or hit you first
* However, you may choke enemies uncouncious
* No powers besides Bend Time and Blink

**Are you a wizard?** - Having found out about his supernatural abilities, Corvo leaves behind physical fighting and spreads fear into enemies as the man whose words are enough to kill large groups. To strengthen the illusion, he never engages in a swordfight.

* No physical fighting
* All kills must be conducted by use of magic or means that make it look like magic (""Bend Time --&gt; use crossbow"" for example is allowed)
* (Alt. easier mode: destroying music boxes is allowed)

They don't know that Corvo didn't actually kill the Empress.  Their superiors have told them that's the story, and they have to trust it.  Even if they have doubts, they have no proof otherwise.  They may be jerks, but they're not evil.  

If you do the non-lethal route: [spoiler](/s ""when the truth about the Lord Regent is exposed, you see the soldiers immediately arrest him."")  That also shows that they think of themselves as being good guys.

Then, when [spoiler](/s ""Havelock &amp; Co. betray you and take charge themselves""), the Watch is again misled.  So they're still innocent.

Now, the Overseers on the other hand...screw those guys.  Even the City Watch hates those guys.  I don't know if the game says it, but I like to imagine that (in the Low Chaos ending) [spoiler](/s ""Emily disbands the Overseers when she becomes Empress and they're gone forever"").  Come to think of it, that might be why [spoiler](/s ""the Outsider helps Corvo in the first place, since the Overseers are his enemies."")

All that said, it's not like I don't enjoy a good slaughter now and then. :P

If you go to the furthest right part of the island in the beginning, there's an open drainage lid that you can Blink onto and sneak in that way.

MOSTLY FLESH AND STEEL: Getting the level 2 upgrade for Blink stops this achievement from unlocking. Bone charms and equipment upgrades you purchase from Piero are okay. Spending Runes on powers is what counts as upgrades, so just don't spend them.
* 2. DETECTION: Detection counts as A) A detection meter getting filled completely (all 3 levels), and are only on humans and the dog creatures (rats and krusts do not count). or B) An alarm going off. This includes the watch towers/turrets turning red and setting it off, not just the ones that manually get set off by guards. The alarm that gets triggered when you escape prison during the first mission does not count as detection, but being seen by guards as you leave does. Take the patch to the left, and drop in the water, staying as far underneath as you can. As long as the detection meter never appears over a guard's head, you're clear.
* 3. NON-LETHALITY: Be careful of where you place unconscious bodies, because if they fall from too great a height (or even slide down stairs), or get eaten by rats, it will count as if you killed them. The Granny Rags mission in the sewers is also currently bugged, and choking or using a tranquilizer dart on her counts as killing her. It even doesn't appear on the mission end screen (the game says no kills, but still considers Granny Rags a kill) You can get around this by just pickpocketing the key from her, and running away. As long as the detection meter doesn't appear, it won't mess up the detection or non-killing achievements. Deaths caused by hacking walls of light or turret towers will stop the achievement too.",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,1350688121.0,,,True,t3_11qtip,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/11qtip/psa_a_few_things_you_should_know_before/,

* No powers, the only ability allowed is Agility. No bone charms either. (optional)
* Sword/ sleep darts only.
* Only allowed to kill main targets, can knock out guards but have to hide bodies.
* Use the Heart as a ""dark passanger"" to determine whether or not the main target shall be spared or killed.

1351692503.0,35,self.dishonored,12ecvf,"An Overseer professor of natural philosophy 
challenges The Outsider to keep a piece of chalk 
from breaking.",intergalacticninja,47,12,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/12ecvf/an_overseer_professor_of_natural_philosophy/,"This is a true story of something that happened just a few years ago at The Academy of Natural Philosophy. There was an Overseer professor of natural philosophy there who was a deeply committed follower of The Abbey of the Everyman. His primary goal for one required class was to spend the entire semester attempting to prove that The Outsider was powerless. His students were always afraid to argue with him because of his impeccable logic and mastery of The Seven Strictures (also, he was a high-ranking Overseer and in the running for the post of High Overseer). For twenty years, he had taught this class and no one had ever had the courage to go against him. Sure, some had argued in class at times, but no one had ever 'really gone against him' (you'll see what I mean later). 

Nobody would go against him because he had a reputation. At the end of every semester, on the last day, he would say to his class of 300 students, ""If there anyone here who still believes in The Outsider's powers, stand up!"" In twenty years, no one had ever stood up. They knew what he was going to do next. He would say, ""because anyone who does believe in The Outsider's powers is a fool. If The Outsider actually had powers, he could stop this piece of chalk from hitting the ground and breaking. Such a simple task to prove that The Outsider is powerful, and yet he can't do it."" And every year, he would drop the chalk onto the tile floor of the classroom and it would shatter into a hundred pieces. The students could do nothing but stop and stare. Most of the students were convinced that The Outsider couldn't exist at all, let alone have powers. Certainly, a number of followers of The Outsider had slipped through, but for 20 years, they had been too afraid to stand up. 

Well, a few years ago, there was a freshman who happened to get enrolled in the class. He was a follower of The Outsider, and bore his mark. He had heard the stories about this professor. He had to take the class because it was one of the required classes for his major and he was afraid. But for 3 months that semester, he prayed every morning, while clutching his bone charm, that he would have the courage to stand up no matter what the professor said or what the class thought. Nothing they said or did could ever shatter his faith, he hoped. 

Finally, the day came. The professor said, ""If there is anyone here who still believes in The Outsider's powers, stand up!"" The professor and the class of 300 people looked at him, shocked, as he stood up at the back of the classroom. The professor shouted, ""You FOOL!! If The Outsider actually had powers, he could keep this piece of chalk from breaking when it hit the ground!"" He proceeded to drop the chalk, but at the exact moment he did, the follower of The Outsider used his '[Bend Time](http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Bend_Time)' Outsider power. He managed to make the chalk slip out of the professor's fingers, off his shirt cuff, onto the pleats of his pants, down his leg, and off his shoe. As it hit the ground, it simply rolled away, unbroken. 

The professor's jaw dropped as he stared at the chalk. He looked up at the young man and then ran out of the lecture hall. The young man who had stood up proceeded to walk to the front of the room and share his faith in The Outsider for the next half hour. 300 students stayed and listened as he told of The Outsider's powers, the shrines, runes and bone charms. He also shared that ""If you really want to meet The Outsider, all you have to do is be a little more interesting.""

Epilogue:  

The young man was arrested the next day by Overseers for heresy. He was then falsely marked as infected by the plague and was put in the Flooded District, where he did contract the plague and became a Weeper. [True story](http://snopes.com/religion/chalk.asp).

really looks like the Golden Cat poster in term of art style. Also, if you read the wikipedia link you'll notice that ""Le Chat Noir"" was a cabaret in the Montmartre district of Paris.  Montmartre, along with Pigalle, is known to be the sex district in Paris, and the Golden Cat is a brothel.

The game has been developped the a French video game developper [Arkane Studios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkane_Studios) and the art director (Sébastien Mitton) is French, which makes it very likely that their inspiration for the game may come from French culture.

It would be tough to play emotionally. Basically, Emily has gone mad with power and is becoming a female Hiram Burrows, only more bloodthirsty. Eventually, Corvo tries to reason with her, and in a fit of rage she puts him to death. Immediately. The guards drag you off, and you are taken to the executioners chamber, where the guards Leave you shackled to the wall. There, while awaiting your death, the outsider visits you, basically saying you can't die yet. Your shackles are broken and you must fight or sneak your way across Dunwall tower to get to Emily. Or, for a change of scenery, perhaps some sort of Royal Boat? A big one. Anyhoo, you finally reach Emily's chambers. This is were it gets heart-rending. Depending on the good or bad play through, two different outcomes are possible. In the bad, she calls for the guards and you can kill her or not. If you don't, the guards will come and run a blade through you as Emily watches. She gets a shocked look on her face and yells Corvo! As you hit the floor, barely alive as the Lady Empress runs over sobbing, repeating I'm so sorry, and you slowly stroke her hair until the void takes you and you return to the outsider. As the epilogue, it shows Emily becoming depressed, until finally a man comes and kills her when she's old an grey. Which might be a Segway into dishonored two. Right, so the good ending would be going into Emily's chambers and her not calling the guards. She talks about how she's not fit to be empress, and says to follow her. The guards will not attack because of Emily. You go to the deck, and she goes to the rail, looks at you, says simply, I'm not like her, Corvo. I can't rule a nation. referring to Empress Jessamine. She slowly falls off the rail into the ocean, and you jump after her, grabbing her into a bear hug as you both plummet into the icy waves. The last thin you hear is her whispering, Corvo. Then you hit the ocean and roll credits. What do you guys think? If not DlC, I'd live a short story written about this. Thanks for reading this absurdly long idea!

The last few parts are being uploaded right now. They'll be up later today. I'll go back and annotate them later this weekend. Maybe.

So yeah, this is the my whole Playthough of Dishonored on Very Hard with No kills, Alerts, upgrades, bone charms or powers besides Blink. It certainly isn't a perfect playthough, as I did use quicksave/quickload if  I made a stupid mistake or if I was decently far along in the mission, but I tried to keep the use of it low. 

But back to the playthough. I'm pretty happy with how this came out. Some missions could have gone better (House of Pleasure) and I did make some really stupid mistakes at some parts, but I'm not perfect. I tried to avoid as many people as I could so I wouldn't have to deal with the bodies. The no powers except Blink wasn't that bad either because Blink is really the only power you need. And I felt as though I got though the missions pretty quickly, so I'm also happy about that.

So now that it's done, I would appreciate any comments you guys have. Any things I did wrong, things that you would like be changed, etc. Also feel free to ask questions about it.

Charms spawn randomly--their 12 locations are fixed, but there are 45 different charms.  Except for this one charm, I haven't found any other charm locations (so far) that change bone charms after a reload.

Also, I'm looking for a list of all the possible charms (not locations).  Anyone got one?

* Acrobat - You climb slightly faster
* Albinos - You encounter white rats slightly more often
* Carrion Killer - Killing rats gives you some adrenaline
* Clockwork Malfunction - Enemy grenades take slightly more time to explode
* Falling Star - Drop assassinating someone gives you a bit of mana
* Healthy Appetite I - Food heals you slightly more
* Plague Affinity - Getting damaged by weepers gives a small amount of mana
* Reinforced Bolts - Bolts stuck in enemies break less often
* Robust I - Potions give you slightly more health
* Robust II - Potions give you moderatly more health
* Spirit Water - Drinking from faucets recharges a small amount of mana
* Strong Arms - Choking is faster
* Sturdy Bolts - Better chance bolts wont break
* Sustained Rage - Your adrenaline takes slightly longer to cool down
* Swift Shadow - You move slightly faster while in stealth mode
* Throwing Hand - You throw carried objects a bit farther
* Tough Skin - Your max health has been slightly increased
* Twist of Fortune I - Very rarely, a potion gives you full mana
* Undertaker - Move faster while carrying a corpse

**Crowd Favorites** - All the ways that are used for achievements

**Wizard** - Only use spells.  No equipment unless absolutely needed by the mission to complete.

**Thief** - Never be spotted, steal and pickpocket every key, jewel, or fine piece of pottery you can get your hands on.  Try not to kill anyone.

**Unlucky** - Make every kill look like an accident.  Throw bodies into the water, drop them off heights, blame the killing on other people (for example, if you encounter two guards, stab one and deal with the other in a believable manner while leaving behind clues like a whiskey bottle in his hand).  Be creative.  Kill as many or as few people as you want.

**Completionist** - Complete all side objectives as well as main during any playthrough.

**Warrior** - Fight everyone that you come across but make sure they know that you're there before attacking.  Shoot off your pistol near them, hit the ground with your sword, and generally charge into battle screaming like a lunatic.

**Assassin** - Kill every hostile in the level silently and without being detected.  

**Mirror's Edge** - Run as quick as possible while avoiding combat as much as you can and go to the objective.        

**Hungry for More** - Play as Warrior but ring alarms to ensure you have more guards to fight 

**Inspector Gadget** - Device kills only (Razor trap, Wall of Light, Sentry, Grenades, etc.) 

**Pied Piper** - Only summon rats to do away with your enemies (once you've unlocked the power)

**Headhunterr** - Crossbow headshots only

**Inigo Montoya** - Announce your arrival with a *BANG!* and make sure that your enemies know you're there.  Then, only kill with a sword in an (dis)honorable duel.  No using spells to cheat!

**Like A Whirlwind** - Give no notice of your presence before dropping in and taking out foes with any and all means possible.  Bombs, bullets, steel, spells, everything is fair game as you take down your terrified foes.

Right when I met Treavor Pendleton I immediately hated him. Don't know why. I had no reason to, I think I just didn't like his face. When you go to assassinate the twins in the Golden Cat, I created a different save (since I was trying to go through the game without killing anyone) and kept killing them over and over, then using the older saves. 

I actually forgot that the twins had tons of slaves until after I beat the mission, and Treavor Pendleton was on my side. So I had no reason to hate the Pendletons. BUT I DID. Every time someone mentioned their name I would get really mad. They were kind of the Dinkleburg of Dishonored for me. After Treavor Pendleton decided it was a good idea to try to kill Corvo, I. Went. Crazy. I went into beast mode specifically to find Pendelton and kill him. I didn't care about Emily anymore, or the rest of the Loyalists. I just wanted to find Pendleton and bring him down, and NO ONE was gonna get in my way.

Please note that I have not seen any of these ideas here and so I'm sorry if these have been said before. My Ideas:

**Overseers vs. Whalers:** For those of you who don't know, the Whalers are Daud's assassins. This would more interesting than your average ""one team versus the other"" game mode. Overseers would have grenades and swords, Whalers would have crossbows, sword, and their magic powers. Although the Whalers may seem overpowered, this could be balanced by making it so Overseers could get power-ups such as music boxes and hounds.

**Plague:** This would be similar to Halo's Infection (or Flood as it's called in Halo 4), with the teams being City Watch and Weepers. It would be easy for City Watch members at first, but it would get more difficult as the Weeper population grows. Weepers could get upgrades such as a swarm of rats and City Watch officers could get something like a one-use plague elixir that converts one Weeper of their choosing back to a human.

I thought I'd kick it off by sharing some thoughts about possible ways to expand the franchise. 

Dishonored : The Battle of Morley Isle. 
With the on going crisis in the capitol of the empire and the Lord Regent's sudden control, the isle of Morley is being crushed under the oppressive boot of the imperialists. The isle is being stripped of its resources to prop up a struggling Empire. The Lord Regent having fought to put down the previous insurrection has set up regiments loyal to him and his new order. 

Even after his fall, pockets of Anti-royalist still exist in the region who believe that it was the Empress and the royal family that where responsible for the woes of the Empire. (This, for me,would borrow heavily from the British conflict of the Government vs the Crown, also know as royalists vs parliamentarians.) Add to that an uneasy population that feels betrayed both by the Empress and the Lord regent you have an Isle on the Edge. 

The new Empress must try to resort order to the Isle by sending in her new Loyalist guards and of course Corvo. 

Here the game play would break down into you as Corvo choosing how to deal with the Islanders. Through the various missions you must crush the uprising and deal with the Lord Regent's last loyal regiments who are attempting to use the uprising to take over the isle and declare independent from the Empire. 

So you have the two main factions - The Empress's New Guard, loyal to the crown and the New Order style parliamentarians - who believe that the Royal family was responsible for the problems in the Empire. In between you have the people of Morley who could be swayed to either side. Does Corvo show the people that the New Empire is progressive and wants to united the isles in peace? Or does he do it through violence and destruction. Putting the people in their place. Here we could have the Morley Rebels, resistance fighters that could be won over or destroyed. So again you'd have you play style effect the game play. 

This would be the first test of the new Empire. 


That would be if we wanted to include the current characters. 


My other choice would be the set the game long after the events of the first game. Perhaps 100 years into the future. Technology has stagnated due to the rarity of whale oil and the plague destroying so much. Perhaps now we begin to see technology that is based on other fuels. 

This leads to Dishonored : The Pandyssian Continent. The home of the plague and many other wondrous things. This could be set in perhaps a city build on the Pandyssian Continent. Perhaps not long after the events of the first game. A city that was meant to help the Empire understand and study the plague, to find new resources. It might be here that you could play as an outsider to the Empire. Trying to resist what you view as its invasion. The Outsider could gift you powers to see what you do. 

You can join a rebellion against the empire with other natives in the city. Then decide if you want to crush the city or help bring peace between the different people. 



Still just random thoughts and I'd be interested on how people see them expanding this universe for the next game.

I've nearly completed the game by going generally non-lethal. When presented with an option I'll go non-lethal for all important figures and saving people when I can. There are some dead guards and weepers about, but always limited to one or two people. 

I wanted to try a more lethal playthough once completed thinking it'd be like most games where the only difference is a couple events and the ending. After reading and viewing some of the more spoiler-prone content regarding how the game reacts to high chaos, I'm not sure I want to.

The game will remind you constantly you're a scumbag. The Outsider will say things (as he does) that will cause you to doubt what you're doing simply by narrating what is going on, which will seem even more pointed when you KNOW what you've done. Game props, dialogues, events, and NPC's change. Most games take your choice in stride, but this game will reveal how you've changed the course of the world single-handedly throughout to make it a terrible, retched place to be.

(I suffer from a disease called Replay-atitis) I would love a sequel and perhaps a multiplayer game mode to come along with it. Take Halo for example. I don't play Halo but you can play the campaign and all but after that there's infinitesimal amounts of hours to keep playing. I think that something like this would be something the fans would really enjoy. This is my idea for it:

Teams:
There are two teams, one with 10 or so people on it and another with only one person, the assassin, or Corvo. The other 10-20 people would be guards; City Watch guards and overseers.

Corvo:
Corvo will have his usual powers including Dark Vision, Blink, Possession, Bend Time, Devouring Swarm, Windblast and perhaps others in the future. In direct confrontation with many guards, Corvo doesn't stand a chance. If the assassin runs up and attempts to kill the guards, he will be easily shot and killed. If the assassin decides to act decisively and hide in shadows, he can take out the guards. Perhaps a non-lethal takedown will give more points. Corvo will have to scavenge for many things across the map such as crossbow bolts, health potions, runes to unlock the more powerful powers, etc.
The Guards:
This class is on the lookout for Covo and must kill this man. At first their job seems easier because it is 10-20 soldiers looking  for one man, but that one man is very talented. Each will have a sword and half of them will have a gun. They must search the map and communicate to find him. A couple will be City Watch commanders and perhaps there could be one overseer with a music box.

Squads:
With some people elected as commanders, a squad system could pair a few people together into each squad which the commander could give orders to. Commands could be as simple as telling one squad to patrol a street or to search a building.

My first playthrough was my clean hands/ghost/mostly flesh and steel play through, while - in my second - I killed every single person I could find.

It's a fantastic game with mostly minor problems, but three things specifically stood out in my mind and I'm curious as to what opinion other people had on these:

1. Swimming is craptastic. There's very few points in the game where water is likely to come into play, but whenever it did I was miserable. I guess it's not so much the swimming itself so much as it is trying to get out of the water. I'm sitting there being blasted by those krust things and trying to jump out of the water, but can't seem to find an edge. I can't swim backwards and look up for a place to blink to because then I'm swimming down. This isn't a huge issue or anything, but I'm curious as to what other people think about it.

2. Aiming blink for climbing up. I felt that this was constantly buggy. I'd stop time, blink across an open field, then try to blink to a platform above only to find that the indicator will not change to the climb up icon. Sit there for a few seconds moving it around trying to get it to switch, time finally unpauses and everyone sees me. Reload, do it again and the indicator appears instantly. Sometimes I point and get the indicator with no problem, sometimes it just doesn't appear. This was a bit more of an issue because it really made the reliability of the blink power unpredictable. I would say that during my stealth playthrough Blink not working was responsible for about half my reloads. 

3. I feel like my character is 5 feet wide. This was only an issue a few times, but when it came out it was very frustrating. Trying to get around NPCs in the hound is impossible if they decide to stand in the middle of walkways, stopping times useuflness for getting around an area runs out if someone was stopped anywhere near a door, etc. etc. Again - this issue didn't come up often, but when it did it was annoying as hell. I'm sitting there looking at a doorway and a guy on the other side who is clearly a good 3-4 feet beyond it. I cannot fit between there. I try and I bump into the guy.

I also hate river krusts. Single most annoying enemy in the game in my opinion.",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,True,t3_11kgve,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/11kgve/while_i_love_the_game_i_have_a_few_complaints/,

Ok so there are a few things you can do, one or all of them depending on what you want. First off is the basic .ini tweak that changes how the engine runs the game. [This file](http://www.mediafire.com/?49sijvkcf55u5hn) is provided by Kakkoii from the Steam forums. Simply download that file then navigate to the 'your games' folder -&gt; Dishonored -&gt; DishonoredGame -&gt; Config. When there extract/paste and allow it to overwrite the other file (which you have backed up). Click save and that's done.

Next is the more noticeable [SweetFX Shader Suite](http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=368880) which can make drastic changes to your game. With this, simply [download](http://dropcanvas.com/l46x9)(I chose the one on the right) and unzip the files to Steamapps/Common/Dishonored/Binaries/Win32.

When you have done that, you have two choices, one is to play around with the settings yourself or, you can use a preset version.
I have found two from Jim2Point0 for both [Nvidia](http://whoisjimothy.com/public/dishonored/sweetfx_compare/SweetFX_settings.txt) and [AMD](http://whoisjimothy.com/public/dishonored/sweetfx_compare/SweetFX_settings.txt). You  go into the /Win32 folder, find the file SweetFX_Settings and copy/paste the settings in, then save and close. As a side note, I find this version to be a little too dark, but again, just go into the SweetFX_Settings and have a play to get desired outcomes.


When you launch the game, make sure to turn **off in game Anti Aliasing and press Scroll Lock to toggle the effects of SweetFX**

Hopefully that will get some nice results for people.

1350683867.0,26,self.dishonored,11rqt9,"[Spoilers / Speculation] ""Honor for All"" is Overseer propaganda",AManHasSpoken,29,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/11rqt9/spoilers_speculation_honor_for_all_is_overseer/,"**Hypothesis**: The ending song, ""Honor for All"", exists in-game as a form of propaganda to indoctrinate children.


**Evidence**

When you first break into the Distillery to infect the Bottle Street gang with the plague, if you're sneaky enough you can overhear a conversation between two of the gang members. They mention a common friend of theirs, ""Eddie"", whose brother was taken in by the Overseers and sent to a special facility.

&gt; *""One of the other places. Where they train the Overseers to be real religious.""*

He then goes on to list what goes on at the facility. Some fairly commonplace stuff, but what struck me the most was these lines.

&gt; *But it gets weird. Some kinda machinery.* **Then a woman laughing, just laughing and laughing. Then music, a kind of plinky plonky sound.** *That's what spooked him.*

Take this moment to listen to the intro to [Honor for All](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RT2q51Zvf0), and consider some lines from the lyrics.

    Oh the sound of her voice, a sweet symphony
    played over and over until you are free

There are other ""oppressive"" themes throughout the text as well, which align with the goals of the Overseers.

    Love is a distant aroma at best
    A withering smile that's stuck deep in your vest

in line with the Sixth Stricture, which forbids ""uncontrolled desire"". All of the seven strictures deal with self-restraint, which goes well in line with the last verse of *Honor for All*.

    Well we shall not stumble, no we shall not fall
    We shall not crumble, no we shall stand tall
    Well death it will come, as sure as the night
    We will not run, no we live but to fight

Which makes sense, considering that the Overseers could be considered the military branch of the Faith of the Everyman. The very last line of the verse, *We tear at the ones who brought the disease*, directly suggests that the singer(s) are indeed fighting the plague and, by extension, the Outsider itself.

**Conclusion**: While it has yet to be confirmed, I would consider it very likely that ""Honor for All"" is a piece of propaganda used as part of an Overseer's ""education"" / indoctrination.

I just posted this as a comment on The Outsider page of the Dishonored Wiki after finishing the game the second time. I figured I would copy and paste it here to see what you think. It's a long one. 

I thought The Outsider was an excellent character with depth which you actively have to seek out. However, I want to make two points in regards to him. 
POINT #1:

The thing I can't stand is how little they resolve him in the end. The initial encounter with him mysterious and is great. Then there are pretty frequent shrines and hallucinations where he speaks to Corvo and comments on his behavior. Then on both of my play throughs, he spoke to me after confronting/pickpocketing Daud and commented on my actions. 

That's it. 

You're never confronted again. The next time you hear him is the ending voiceover. I felt like his presence/contact should either grow or remain consistent throughout the game but instead his presence becomes increasingly spotty toward the end. Almost to the point where I forgot he existed.

I was actually pretty livid at first because I was looking forward to at LEAST one final face to face with the guy. I was hoping he would appear at the end (before or after you confront Havelock) to reveal something or drop a bit of wisdom or have a last meeting but......nothing. Just a 30 second wrap up and a farewell. 

I understand the argument that he is a neutral onlooker whose motivations are not clear. I know that he appears to certain people he finds interesting, grants them power and amuses himself by watching how they wield it. I get it. He's mysterious. He doesn't need explaining. Still, it's no reason for him to lose presence late in the game and to give his character no resolution or final confrontation with Corvo. 

((Side note: I really liked the whole part with Daud because even though the Outsider clearly has a great investment in Daud, enough to let him spread the power to others, he expects you to kill him and pretty much invites you to do so. He's even surprised and a little disappointed if you don't.))

POINT #2:

I was also hoping he would shed some light or have a connection to another story line I felt wasn't adequately dealt with. The plague. 

I subscribe to the idea that The Outsider is in some way responsible for the plague. That or he's been at least fueling it's fire all along.

Think of who we know he contacts:

1) Corvo - a man seeking redemption and vengeance against those who wronged him.

2) Daud - a foreigner with the mindset of an assassin

3) Piero- an inventor who can create any number of dangerous weapons

4) Granny Rags - who we are led to believe he drove insane and keeps the rats as pets

They can all contribute to the plague by driving body counts or cultivating the rat population (he literally gives you the power to conjure them from thin air).

We also see references to him scrawled on the walls in the blood of plague victims. It's understood that The Outsider is well known in the world as an evil, devil-like being and they can simply be attributing the situation to him. However, the knowledge we have of him from encountering first hand leads me to believe that he is appearing in some capacity to those infected with the plague. Either shortly before death or at the peak of the disease, where I think he has a hand in driving them mad to the point of becoming feral Weepers (kind of like he did with Vera Morley/Granny Rags). 

Motivation? It may be that, being a spirit associated with whales, Dunwall's whaling industry and the use of whale oil doesn't sit well with him, especially when it's used by those who curse his name and write him off as the bad guy. So he affects those those he likes and who have the ability to create chaos. This would explain why he's so cavalier with what happens to the citizens. 

It is plausible because it doesn't conflict with his neutral status. He's giving them an easy avenue to create chaos and destroy the city, but he leaves it up to them and is accepting of any outcome. It's evidenced in the fact that he's amused and pleasantly surprised with Corvo in the low chaos ending.  

Anyway, I was hoping for a reveal along the lines of the whale oil or it's by products being what infected the rats with the plague in the first place. Sort of like poetic justice in that The Outsider designed it so their greatest resource is what killed them. But, alas, there was nothing to tie them together or give closure to either story line. 

My apologies for this lengthy ramble. As I said at the beginning, great character. Would love to see more.

Would you like to see a short film merging the worlds of Dishonored and Portal together? Well, we need your help

One of my peers at my University- a very talented double major in Film and Visual Effects- is aiming to create a live action short film based on the origins of the portal technology from Portal and Portal 2 , based on an Easter egg in Dishonored. This would follow the experiments done by Piero Joplin, and feature characters from both games. Not only will the movie feature amazing likenesses of your video game favorites, but also an approach to the effects not seen before, created by an outstanding VFX crew. 

Watch the video above for a sneak peak! (effects are not final and will vary compared to the final project)

Now this is where you come in. For this to happen, we need to raise around $1500 in 30 days. Our Kickstarter is located at the link above, and every dollar will help! Every step of the way there are awesome rewards, such as shirts, buttons, signed merchandise, DVDs and Blu-rays of the film and even actual props from the movie!

I certainly understand if you cannot donate, but publicity is key to funding a Kickstarter, and if you can simply share the link, everyone on the cast and crew would be greatly appreciative!

So if you are a fan of Portal and/or Dishonored, and want to see this amazing short film come to life, please help us by donating, sharing, and/or upvoting this post!

Some notes and tips.,IArgueWithAtheists,34,12,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/1j3l4b/just_completed_ghost_shadow_clean_hands_mostly/,"I know this is old hat by now. I just bought the game from the Steam sale and wanted to try this. Not actually that difficult, once you realize that the objective is to just find the most straightforward path to objectives possible while ignoring most of the game. Of course, that becomes easier once you've reloaded a few times and you learn the layout of levels.

Truth is, the only part that I found especially difficult was right at the beginning of the Flooded District, when two whalers are prancing about between your prison and the only door out and you have no sleep darts. It took a number of reloads before I could ""Blink-Blink"" out without getting noticed.

I had a couple other trouble spots at the Boyle Party, namely (1) finding a strategy for clearing out the kitchen to remove witnesses, and (2) clearing out the 4 guards from the upstairs hallway. On my playthrough, the culprit was Lydia Boyle (red), which was a pain in the ass because I couldn't nab her until she mosied into the stairwell on her own.

By far the easiest mission? Light at the End. Laughable. I just blinked into the right-most entry pipe, up to the top of the wall. Then I took it all the way around the complex, where I was just barely able to blink across to the main center building. From there, I managed to climb on top of the supports leading up to the lighthouse. Very few guards.

Seeing those achievements pop up one-by-one was extremely satisfying. I haven't tried to play a ""dark"" game yet or a completionist game, so I'm excited to do those next, not to mention the Daud DLC.

Nobody talks about this game anymore, which makes me sad. It's so much fun.",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,True,t3_1j3l4b,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/1j3l4b/just_completed_ghost_shadow_clean_hands_mostly/,

I just finished my first playthrough, low-chaos.  I picked up on all the clues about Corvo and the Kaldwins being one happy secret family, and more importantly, my interpretation of Corvo was that he *acted* like her father whether it was a biological relationship or not.

My question to this sub is, was anyone else hoping for an ending where Emily *did not* become empress?  Think about it, over the course of six months and the few days it takes to complete each mission, the Empire's leadership changes **three** times.  And assuming she was safe, she'd still be a new monarch taking the reins of an empire absolutely ravaged by plague.

Why would Corvo subject her to that?  One of the books mentions that Jessamine's father was not close to the throne, but still became emperor, so it's not exactly an established lineage, and there are probably other blood candidates available.  

We see during her interactions with Callista and Corvo that Emily is still obviously immature, complaining about her schooling and imagining what it would be like to boss everyone around.  She clearly is not prepared to rule over the Empire at that age.

It's implied that Corvo himself guides her in court (or manipulates her, depending on your interpretation), but again, the impression I got of Corvo is someone who would not want that responsibility, and would have preferred a simpler life where he could easily protect Emily.  Maybe this comes from watching shows like Game of Thrones, but my instinct as a father-figure would be to get her the hell away from the throne.",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,True,t3_141bbk,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/141bbk/about_emily_endgame_spoilers_ye_be_warned/,

Man of faith - You are a man of faith. You closely abide by the seven strictures and attend overseer sermons. You denounce all heresy so reject overseer shrines, runes and bone charms.

You are forbidden from ever harming an overseer and must take out Campbell non-lethally as well as aiding him take out Curnow. You are forbidden from assisting (in any way) the witch ""granny rags"" in her acts of fiendish sacrilege. You may punish citizens, watch members and other targets as you please.

Bonus objective: Eliminate Madame Prudence. Her rule over the Golden Cat is illegitemate and corrupt. She is suspected as a member of corporate espionage from a rival brothel and is also suspected of killing the previous madame to install herself as owner.

Get rid of her her now and save the Golden Cat from bankrupcy and plague, this contract was taken out by a man high up in the Lord Regent's command and he may provide helpful information should we help him as he is in charge of the Golden Cat's finances.

So there we are, post your best results in the comments and tell me what you think!

I don't know if I'm late with this idea but after a ghost/didn't kill anyone/mostly flesh and steel playthrough I'm playing a high chaos ghost run without using blink.

It's pretty fun killing everyone. Obviously you need shadow kill (expert mode: do it without shadow kill) and maybe the double jump.

I enjoy this run very much but it is not rewarding at all.
The wanted posters show my face although no one saw me.
And The guards talk about a man in a mask.

I'd find it awesome if they'd talk about Guards disappearing out of nowhere or an evil Ghost who kills everyone if the corpses may have been found.

But nothing like that is in this playthrpugh to make it worthy.
But still...it is fucking fun!

And without using blink you may find path you never noticed the first playthroughs.

Let me know what you think.

(not sure what's there if you dindt do any of their quests)

Granny rags will task you with cutting slackjaw up, or you will rebel against that, starting a bossfigth against Granny Rags. If you do this however, you will fail the ""Dindt get noticed"" and ""Dindt kill anyone"" objective for that mission. If you kill Slackjaw, you will fail the ""dindt kill anyone objective, and unless you found the key somewhere else, you can't get past the last door.

If you want to get both Ghost and clean for that part:

* Talk to granny rags
* Choose the option to cut up slackjaw
* Go pick up the last painting in granny's shack
* Go back and sneak up on Granny (If you try to kock her out you will automaticly start the boss encounter)
* Take the key.
* RUN before she materializes
* Close the sewer door behind you. (!!!)
* Take the last rune and blueprint
* Proceed to end the mission.

On high chaos, the bit after Granny rags and Slackjaw will be filled with weepers, on low chaos, there will be non-hostile survivors.

As a 3D Artist who have mostly been focusing on working with Environtments etc i now felt for studying and try some Character sculpting so decided to start a small personal project to make a Character fully imported to UDK with animations etc. 

The reason why i upload it here in the Dishonored sub is because i am aiming for the style that Dishonored uses for their characters. It might not be 100% but i try to get as close as possible from studying their character sculpts etc. Maybe you fellow Dishonored fans could tell me if i'm on the right path or no? :)

Here is what i got so far, the hair is very WIP (Work In Progress) atm and as it's the first time i am doing hair as well it might not look great. I will add more hair in the front and also add a ponytail :)

Here is what i got so far!:

I killed everyone I found. Civilians, guards, you name it, they died. I even would open up non-lethal side missions just so I could peel people away from crowds to kill them in silence (the lord in the Boyle Mansion who gave off the creepy rape vibe).

Going throughout the game, it was interesting to see people's reactions to you. Emily's pictures get darker, she talks about things like building two boats and ramming them together to watch all the men die, the maids get nervous about her. Obviously the plague rats and the Weeper count increases, which made it more challenging, as did my poorly made decision to fight through the streets like a crack addict in every level up to the the Boyle party (which was the hardest level to kill everyone in, in my humble opinion).

I killed Martin with rats, killed Pendleton with rats, and shot an exploding bullet at Emily, hoping to take both her and Havelock down in one shot. When that failed, I stood above her in the rain, watching behind the merciless mask while her grip slipped.

----

It was bad. It was really, really bad. I actually feel pretty horrible for all the terrible things that happened. But it was empowering to have a game where you were actually allowed to do pretty much as you please. A game where you don't *have* to save anyone. You can kill literally every character in the game besides the Empress (which I find ironic given the deception the Spymaster spins after her death).

1350252239.0,17,self.dishonored,11hacz,"Multiplayer: Discussion, Thoughts, Suggestions!",ObsidianOverlord,21,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/11hacz/multiplayer_discussion_thoughts_suggestions/,"Hello everyone, I’d like to take a little bit of time to talk about a controversial topic: *Multiplayer*. 


There are many people in the community who would like to see some form of multiplayer put in to the game and there are many others who think it would be a bad idea. I’m here to offer some ideas about how it could be implemented without ruining the feel of the game but at the same time create and enjoyable experience for those who want to test their magic and metal against other players. 


First off: when I say multiplayer I know many people have a knee-jerk reaction to think of something like Call Of Duty/Halo style death-matches, capture the flag, etc. But as Dishonored is such a different experience it wold both require a different approach and a different justification for purpose. 


I’ll list a couple ideas of game modes that would fit well with an assassination type game, I will be leaving out the Assassins Creed model because it’s been brought up before and I don’t believe it needs to be covered as a possibility.

**Lord Protectors** – This game mode would involve a team of elite guards protecting a target from a team of assassins (not Corvo, more like the NPC assassins of Doud.) The 2 teams start in different areas, the guards in a base-type location and the assassins start in a blocked of area, after a minuet for the guards to prepare the assassins are let out and are then tasked with eliminating the VIP as the guards do what they can to stop them. One life for everyone and a time limit of 10 minutes or so, you get the picture. 


**Death-match** – Because it’s popular I could see this one being available, assuming everyone is familiar with the concept of ‘kill the other guys’ all that’s needed is a justification for the bloodshed. A good reason would be The Outsider himself, promising the participants more of his void-magic if they are victorious many different men from the isles fight for his amusement. 


**Distillery Control**- Domination style or King of The Hill type game, this would revolve around keeping control of a whale-oil pump, controlling the pump would provide the controllers with access to the volatile tanks as well as a defendable position and spawn-point. 


**Blueprint Grab** – 2 teams, 2 bases, capture the flag, only the flags are blueprints to the other teams arch-pylon. Once one team has gotten the appropriate amount of blueprints the pylon is completed and the enemy team is vaporized. 

You can imagine other game modes as you please, I won’t go on. What I would like to talk about now is the way that players will get to create their character. It should be plain to see that a system that takes from the single player would not be balanced, as well as one that unlocks upgrades the more someone plays. I have 2 ideas to suggest here, the first being a class based choice system: take the “Doud’s assassins “ team for instance. 


*Assassin* – Comes with rank I blink ability as well as a crossbow (normal bolts), acrobatics rank II, Mask optics II, Silent footsteps II and some health potions (2.)


*Hunter-Witch* – Comes with rank I blink, a pistol, rank I rat swarm, more mana than the assassin as well as more efficient regeneration in the form of a potion and possession rank I. 


*Outsider’s Chosen* – Rank II blink, rank I wind, rank II rat swarm, time warp (it would work more like a phase shift in multiplayer, making the character immune and invisible to anyone not in the same phase) as well as 2 or so mana potions. 


The guard’s team would focus more on things like vitality, pistols, spring razors, etc. 

The second option to creating a multiplayer character would be to have more customization, for instance letting a player have a blank assassin as well as (just an example) 20 runes and 5000 gold then letting them purchase upgrades and powers as they see fit, but not giving them any extra resources to spend to keep things balanced. 
Say you wanted to create a character that deals with heavy-magic, you could buy runes and mana potions with some of your gold, or say you wanted to make someone that is based on a more non-magical style then you would put those runes in to things like vitality and agility then spend gold on pistol upgrades/bullets/sword upgrades. 
Of course some upgrades would have to be worked on for multiplayer, say sleep darts would be off-limits or just temporary as well as expensive. Sword upgrades would probably work based of damage not on sword-locking fights and ammunition prices would have to be adjusted. 


I think that it would be very impressive to see a multiplayer mode in dishonored, sneaking up behind someone and then stabbing them would be fun; maybe choking them out would be a kind of ‘humiliation’ kill. 


I put a lot of thought in to this so any suggestions, thoughts or ideas would be really great to hear. Do you think that a multiplayer mode would be a good feature? Keep in mind that the length of the game isn’t something that drives people to play it, and this would only add to the playability and only support such an impressive game further.

1373807478.0,18,self.dishonored,1i9vom,My ideas for a Sequel,AdilMasteR,25,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/1i9vom/my_ideas_for_a_sequel/,"Dishonored had me waiting from when the first trailers came and to release and it was so worth it, one great game which is in my all-time favorites. However, there was things that could have been added to make the experience even better and much more long-lasting. Some of my ideas:

**Main additions**

A sequel wouldn't really work if you just set it in Dunwall after the main events of the first game, but rather if you set it in an entirely different city in about the same time (or maybe some 100 years forward or back), with a new protagonist. It would be the best if the game was more open-world than it is now, but maybe not as open-world as say Assassin's Creed. Greatly designed and as free as you want it, but not with unneeded space. Maybe a linear open-world would work, a bit like games like Need for Speed or Thief 3 (not sure how Thief 4 will be yet). Then it wont be as boring as Assassin's Creed world because it adds a lot more of designing. It would also be cool if you could steal from houses like in Thief.

**Art Design**

Dishonored is a beautiful game, but if played a lot the gray colors can get pretty dull and boring. Big parts of the game are also played in dull alleyways and the like. While you can't really change much of this in Dunwall, you could change it in a new city. Bring forth more colors, and at the same time bring forth lots of landmarks. You could revisit some of the noticeable places of Dunwall in a sequel and at the same time show lots of new places in the new city. Landmarks are what really shows the epicness of the game, and creates those ""Wow"" moments.

**Equipment system**

With a semi-open world you can use a much more complex trading system where different kinds of stores can sell different things. You could have a home of your own where you can craft upgrades or bone charms and make different kinds of potions or gems with ingredients you may have bought with money that you have got from selling stolen artifacts at certain shops. You could maybe be able to buy clothes and s on to change how you look.

**Ability System**

In the first game they didn't really have much customization. You could get the ability, and you could upgrade it once, but not much else. It would be cool to have a ""choose-your-upgrade tree"" were you would get the ability, but when you want to upgrade it you could choose 1 out of 2/3 upgrades to get for the ability, and then 1 out of 2/3 again the next time you upgrade that branch off of the first choice. So while the first choice may be pretty normal, the branching choices can have some different effects. This adds a lot of replayability since depending on your ability choices you can get entirely different playstyles.

**Example given for Vitality:**

*Vitality:*

Gives you additional health

*First choice:*

* Extra Vitality: You get additional damage resistance

* Regeneration: You get minor health regen

*Second choice:*

Extra Vitality:

* Explosion Resistance: You take less damage from fire and explosive weapons

* Bulkiness: You take less damage from melee weapons

Regeneration:

* Blood Leech: Your melee attacks and assassinations have a lifesteal effect

* Magical Regen: You get a small amount of health when using an ability

**Example given for Blink:**

*Blink:*

You can blink to places

*First Choice:*

* Blink Freeze; Time freezes when using Blink

* Improved Usage: Blink takes less mana to use

* Lengthy Blink: Blink has increased range

*Second Choice:*

Blink Freeze:

* Blink Heat: When using blink, enemies get a slight glow on them to become easier to see

* Invisibility Blink: After using Blink you get invisible for a short duration ( can only be used once every x seconds)

Improved Usage:

* Speediness: After using Blink you get a movement speed boost for a small amount of time.

* Double Blink: After using Blink you have a short time to use it again without any mana costs

Lengthy Blink:

* Floating: After blinking you can move in the air for a small amount of time.

* Gravity Rush: You can blink onto ceilings and stay there for a small amount of time

**Additional Replayability**

*Challenge Mode*

A gamemode similar to Dunwall City Trials could be in the game on release but with more versatile and more randomly generated challenges. There could also be rewards added into the main game, like new weapons, clothes and bone charms you could get, and of course a leaderboard.

*Co-op*

A 2-player co-op campaign similar to that of Portal 2 or Far Cry 3 in that it follows two different protagonists during about the same time as the main game. It could be more linear than the main campaign, but with some things that almost requires 2 players to make it work.

There could also be co-op on some of the challenge missions, like the brawl one.

*Level Editor*

This is a very ""if"" request. I don't think we'll have a chance of seeing this at all but if it was in the game you could create your own campaings or just challenges for other people to complete.

**Multiplayer**

This is something that I think was missing a bit from the original game since it fits and would add so much replayability. It doesn't maybe fit the story that much, but it would be really fun to have. There are a lot of gamemodes that would be fitting for the game:

*Plague:*

Like Infection from Halo. One player starts out as an infected and the others as City Watch/Police. If you get killed by the infected you turn infected until everyone is infected.

*Gang War:*

Dauds gang vs. Another gang with some powers. Basically Assassin's vs Assassins's straight up team deathmatch.

*Assassination:*

Kind of like a VIP gamemode. The guards are transporting a noble and it's the assassins' job to kill it. There would be more guards than assassins.

*City Watch vs. Assassin's*

Team Deathmatch between guards and assassin's. Guards would have more health and so while the assassins would have to use their agility.

*Masquerade:*

Similar to the Assassin's Creed multiplayer. everyone is assigned a target and everyone has a hunter on them and you walk around to find your target without getting killed yourself.

There are oviously a lot more possible gamemodes but these were just some of them.

**-----------------------------------------------------------**

If everything or most of this was added to a sequel I would gladly give it my personal Best Game of the Universe award, and I believe that Arkane could bring themselves to do it.

I heard about their darkest moments, finding out he lost his brother, her mother is all she has, you know, the sorts. And i found myself pitying some of them, and going out of my way to find out who truly deserved to die. Almost vigilantism. And i thought about how when we ""listen to our heart"" in the real life. People using it as phase of just, ""be a good person"" ,or ""listen to your heart for the hard decisions"" and things like that. I found that whole comparison very interesting.

Sorry if the format is terrible the below is a comment I  was able to update as an edit in the main post 


In the mean time I am using buildings from the city of Venice as a loose guide that I can use side by side. The reason I am using Venice, as stated by the developers, ""Some elements of the world design are derived from the game's fictional alternate industrial revolution, and others are deliberately impressionistic."". I am going to look at some 3D models in Google Earth if I can't find a better reference point. The style will obviously need to be less bright to a degree as well as more dilapidated.

-Just had an idea. I can try to obtain a copy for the PC, is there a mod that would allow me to fly? I would not be using this copy to play but instead as an architecture reference.

This works great and all, but I found it a tad tedious to keep pushing numpad buttons after each load (and there's a lot of that happening), so I piped the FOV command to the ""Move forward"" command. In this way the FOV is set as soon as you move forward.

Also in your DishonoredInput.ini, search for the line
 
""BaseBindings=(Name=""GBA_MoveForward"",Command=""Axis aBaseY Speed=1.0"")

and change it to

So yesterday I purchased this game and I was superhyped to play (I still am) but there's this problem that keeps bugging me. As soon as I start the game, I see the logos and I get to the loading screen, from there I get ""Dishonored has stopped working"".
 I've been checking at several places for a fix, but I haven't seemed to find one that does it.

So far I've tried to:

• Run as admin.
• Run in Windows XP (Service pack 3)
• Enabled Steam Cloud Synchronization in both Steam and Dishonored.
• Run in Windowed.

If anyone else have encountered this problem, how did you fix it/ do you have any idea how to fix? 

*SOLVED* 
Solution: I enabled Cloud for both Dishonored and Steam. After that I exited Steam and applied Steam.exe to ""Run as admin"", I did also run Dishonored.exe as admin and changed the compatibility mode to Windows XP (Service Pack 3).

Possibly Delilah? She is shrouded in mystery at the moment, but seems to have some sort of mystical powers.

If Delilah does, maybe the two other witches do too - it's stated that she's part of a coven of witches, so there are 2 others.

Billie Lurk? Although she does say when you go to the Outsider's Shrine   in the Legal District that she hopes one day she'll talk to him, but, then again, she does the mystical black arrow shooting thing at the end, which we don't see anyone else do.

DON'T READ IT IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE DLC.

I just finished the new DLC a few minutes ago, on low chaos. Overall, I'd say it was pretty good. 

The new nonlethal options were great, such as the Chokedust Grenade and the Stun Mine. I enjoyed the twist on Blink, and the replacement of the Heart with 'Void Gaze' which mixes The Heart and Dark Vision. It made searching for Bone Charms and Runes actually somewhat challenging instead of 'Follow the arrow!'. I didn't really use 'Summon Assassin' much, due to me going for a Low Chaos run, but it was a nice feature nonetheless. I loved the Thief-esque system of purchasing gear, upgrades and ""Favors"" before the level, though I felt it would have been better if you were buying this stuff by going around the Whaler's Base and purchasing things from merchants. Essentially, the Hound Pits but in the Whaler's Base. Though I can fully understand this being excluded due to time/budget constraints.

The level design was at it's strongest in the first level - The Slaughterhouse in general was really well done. It was a very different environment to the main game, a glimpse of the gritty, industrial underside that fuels Dunwall and the Empire. 

The Legal District was pretty fun, as well. We got to see the Hatters, who had been mentioned in the main game. Timsh's Manor was quite a fun and tricky area to roam around, at least without alerting the guards.

The Final Mission is probably the worst part of the DLC, however. Rushed story, the half-assed attempt to make you feel betrayed at Billie Lurk, having to arduously go around and essentially repeat the same scenario 4 times (Freeing the Assassins) in a map you already know, with no large changes other than throwing in a few Overseers, hanging up some Abbey flags and some very minor scenery. 

Granny Rag's ""Recipes"" were a nice addition, also. I liked how they were somewhat of a riddle instead of a ""Follow the arrow and do X"", especially when getting the Tarot Card in the Legal District and the Weeper Corpse in the Slaughterhouse. 

The Story however, is where the DLC is weakest. It felt like they were trying to tell some great epic, this tale of Daud's Redemption, but they had to rush it - This is a DLC, not a full game. They couldn't take their time with the storytelling, and because of the large plotline they chose to handle, it just ended up feeling incredibly rushed and hurried, at least to me. The little 'Slideshows' between the missions just felt like them saying ""Here's all this stuff that happened but we don't have enough time or budget to actually show it to you. Just take our word for it."".

Billie Lurk's betrayal felt... Well, I could see it coming as soon as I heard that the Overseers had been ""Informed"". It isn't the fact that this was predictable that got me, it's the fact that Billie Lurk, while certainly an interesting character, wasn't given enough time around Daud for you to build up a connection with them. The betrayal felt trivial, because while it's all well and good to say Daud has known this woman nearly his whole life, the player can't exactly feel like they've been betrayed by an old friend because we've only seen this woman occasionally throughout the DLC. 

Chaos felt pretty pointless here. I plan to do a run on High Chaos later, primarily because I want to see the Slaughterhouse blow up, but I doubt it will make much difference. When I first heard of the DLC, I speculated that on Low Chaos, the ending would be Corvo sparing you, and on High Chaos, the ending would be Corvo killing you, an idea which I still feel should have been included. 

TL;DR They bit off more than they could chew with the Story, it was rushed and poorly done, Chaos was thrown in there for pretty much no reason, the new Spells, Equipment and Side Quests are all cool and the Level Design for the most is pretty good. I'd say it stands at around 6.5/10. Certainly worth $10.

So I figured, since we're all here in one subreddit, why not share our knowledge with each other?

I was starting to get really frustrated during the prison escape and then even more so on the first mission but now I'm several in and starting to feel so comfortable in this play style.  My first run I tried to go low chaos but ended up killing a lot in the last two missions resulting in the high chaos ending (which was fucking sad, especially regarding Samuel).

I remember trying a similar playthrough on Deus Ex:HR (great game too BTW) but this game blows that one out of the water in terms of how it feels to play in this manner.

____

Oh well honor for all of the big and the small

Well the taller they stand well the harder they fall

We live for today but we die for the next

With blood in our veins and the air in our chests

Oh we step into war with our hearts on the line

The dirt on our boots it shakes free over time



&gt;The music it fades

&gt;The violence slows

&gt;The darkness it rises

&gt;As the sun goes



Love is a distant aroma at best

A withering smile that stuck deep in your vest

The night 'ere it wraps its fingers around

Your body it shakes from a now distant sound

Oh the sound of her voice a sweet symphony

Played over and over until you are free



&gt;The music it fades

&gt;The violence slows

&gt;The darkness it rises

&gt;As the sun goes



&gt;Can you feel the

&gt;New day rising

&gt;Climbing up the

&gt;East horizon

&gt;They can't hold us

&gt;Down we'll fight through

&gt;Each and every

&gt;One will start new



Well we shall not stumble no we shall not fall

We shall not crumble no we shall stand tall

Well death it will come as sure as the night

We will not run no we live but to fight

Oh with blood on our hands and dirt on our knees

We tear at the ones who brought the disease



&gt;The music it fades

&gt;The violence slows

&gt;The darkness it rises

&gt;As the sun goes



&gt;Can you feel the

&gt;New day rising

&gt;Climbing up the

Normally I would join these people in their cries against the developers for missing the main point of any plot driven game.

But Dishonored is different.

I like to think of the possible story paths not as simple high chaos and low chaos choices, but as different mindsets for Corvo. My first playthrough I played as if Corvo slowly descended into madness. Corvo felt like anyone who isn't Emily is a potential enemy. Corvo would kill anyone who got in his way or tried to harm Emily. This led to a high chaos ending, which worked perfectly with the way Corvo descended into madness. 


I'm currently working on a different mindset playthrough. One in which Corvo keeps his bearings and doesn't want anyone to die in his process of restoring order. He doesn't trust the outsider, so he rarely uses the powers given to him. 


I feel like playing in this fashion really makes the game more enjoyable.

First couple hours, spoilers.",penguinfinity,15,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/1h12wa/new_to_this_game_holy_crap_what_a_surprise_first/,"So I saw the trailer for Dishonored a while back and kinda forgot about it. Okay, steampunk Assassin's Creed. Might get it sooner or later but it's not a priority. Got it and New Vegas Ultimate for $15 last week, finally got a chance to play it.

The beginning (up until you're framed) is a bit brighter than I expected, but very cool. Love the boat lift part. And the kid, I have a niece about her age, it's nice to see a kid portrayed somewhat realistically. (Nice way to slip a sneak tutorial in, too.) What happened wasn't a big surprise, I was kind of expecting something like that.

Prison break/sewer stuff is okay, kind of reminds me of Half-Life 2. The hand-holding is a bit much, though the sneaking is cool. Get to the rebel base (of course it's a bar, where have I seen this trope before?), look around, oh cool you can peep through keyholes, that's only the coolest thing ever... Then I go to sleep.

What the actual fuck is this? Did I click on Dishonored or Psychonauts?

I hope this game continues to surprise me. I'm on the first actual mission. Met the crazy old lady, got the rat poison, and I'm in the whiskey still. The ~~Whirlwind Sprint shout~~ Blink power is a lot of fun, and I can't wait to get the ~~Unrelenting Force shout~~ Windblast power.

So many places this game seems to draw inspiration. I'm definitely feeling shades of Deus Ex and Thief here. Hell, this is more of a Deus Ex game than Human Revolution was.

What do you guys think the possibility is that Corvo is actually Emily's father? It seems hinted at pretty heavily. (I haven't finished a High Chaos run yet, so I'm not sure if it includes any extra hints towards that.)

* Corvo and the Empress were obviously very close.
* Jessamine is apparently single, and there's never any talk of a husband or former lover.
* Corvo and Emily are obviously very close. Although it's never explicitly stated as such, it does seem like a father-daughter relationship almost.
* And the big clue, the picture of Corvo that Emily draws that says ""Daddy"".
* When I played a low chaos run, the most important thing seemed to be keeping Emily safe. (On a high chaos run it feels, to me, more about Corvo's revenge.)

Emily's picture could just mean that she loves Corvo and sees him as a father figure. However, even if he is her father, it seems she doesn't know it. Jessamine and Corvo's relationship would have been an illegitimate one by the eyes of Dunwall, I would assume, and would have been kept under wraps. If he truly is her father, it seems that no one is aware. Otherwise I'm sure Havelock, Pendelton, Samuel, or someone else in the conspiracy would have mentioned it.

Even if he's not her father, though, he's obviously the father figure in her life. And if that's the case, it make me wonder who her real father is/was.",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,True,t3_14gmr9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/14gmr9/about_emilyspoilers/,

I have seen dishonored labelled as a steam-punk game. I've been thinking, surely it isn't? [Steampunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) is defined as a medium with steam powered machine and weapons, in such a way that boiled water creates steam which creates movement and therefore energy. From what I have seen so far in Dishonored there is nothing of the sort anywhere in it. Other than having some typically steampunk aesthetics (gothic structures, Corvo's lens on his mask, etc), there is nothing I can think of that is actually steam driven: can we really call Dishonored 'steampunk'?

A friend of mine suggested it was, what he calls, teslapunk: using electricity in fantastical ways such as with the walls of light and arc pylons, but again, I can't think of it as a tesla punk game because there's not enough... well, tesla!

The only thing I can think to call Dishonored is the strangest of the three: Whalepunk. Everything in Dunwall is powered by energy made from the burning of whale fat, so it Dishonored the first 'whalepunk' medium?

I figured right from the beginning that she was a woman based on her voice, but any mention of her by Daud or in the books are all gender neutral (i.e., instead of saying, ""She was here,"" he always says, ""Lurk was here."" This makes me think that her gender was supposed to be a big reveal for the final fight. Was anyone else aware of her gender from the start, or did you not realise until the end?"")",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,True,t3_1cpnpu,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/1cpnpu/spoilers_i_have_a_knife_of_dunwall_question/,
