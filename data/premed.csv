OKAY! The ONE rule. I would be so bold as to say these PDFs are ALL of the information that is covered on the MCAT. Fuck $2,000 classes, this is EVERYTHING I EVER encountered on ANY practice test (AAMC, Kaplan, Gold Standard, The Berkeley Review, The Princeton Review, Columbia Review, ARCO, or Exam Krackers 1001's) or even the real thing. There is an unholy amount of information in this post. I spent a solid 2 hours on each one of these powerpoints about a year ago. A lot of work...and I'm handing them out to y'all for free. Who knows, maybe these study guides help 10% of you do 5% better on the MCAT, and some of you become doctors and then help out society. Get the idea? Positive energy, motherfuckers. SO, even though I can't enforce this, I must say there is one rule: you have to pay it forward. Help out someone younger than you get into medical school. And it can't be something simple; you have to put some effort into it (Like the 100 hours of work i'm giving y'all for free). Maybe give them these PDFs. Yes, do that. Spread these PDFs around as much as possible. Hell, maybe sit down with a classmate one day you don't even know and lend them a hand. YOU HAVE TO HELP SOMEBODY! Keep the positivity train going and eventually, even if incrementally, the world will be a better place :)

I have sub-par statistics (3.3 cGPA and 3.6 sGPA; 32T MCAT [11/11/10]) and decent ECs, but have been told from every school that my application was excellent because of the total picture of it. I was told by the deans of two of the schools that my interviews solidified my acceptances.

I have noticed there is no  guide in the sidebar, so I thought I could write something and answer any questions people might have. I realize a lot of you view me as a peer rather than some definitive ADCOM member or something, but I don't want to write this as if I am anything but a peer offering insight into the process as well as what made my application successful. I've also contacted a friend of mine who was accepted on very different terms to see if she would want to contribute. 

My idea consists of

1. Undergrad - more than just the grades. Defining your application and such.

2. The MCAT - a more focused guide on what I found good, what I found bad, and general prep.

3. The Application - Personal Statement

4. The Application -  Work &amp; Activities

5. The Interview

EDIT: I had the FAQ in a comment, I realized it would probably be better up here. Deleting it down in the comments.

FAQ

* How much did you study?

I started three months before my MCAT. Honestly, my first month was not much, I studied only like one to two hours a day, and I skipped quite a few days. The second month, I studied as much as I could, but it was April, and finals were approaching. I tried to squeeze in at least three hours a day. When finals ended in late April, I had about two and a half weeks before my MCAT where I studied nearly all day. At least ten hours a day. But guys, don't try to be so methodical about this. Study until you get the topic. Time won't do anything. Just study until you really get it. You know that topic you don't get so well? It'll be on the MCAT. I would bet my left nut on it.

* What is your major?

Math. The last time I took orgo/physics/chem/bio was nearly two years ago, at best, so I knew jack shit. I would take the MCAT right after orgo 2 if I had the choice again.

* How did you study?

I did not take a course. I did have the kaplan review books from a friend who took the course, and I bought the princeton review cracking the MCAT book. I read all of them multiple times, and I have to say that they both have their strengths and faults. If I was forced to choose one, I would choose TPR. And most importantly: I took a ton of practice tests.

For the first month and 3 weeks, all I did was read and review and do those sample problems at the end. I took a test with nearly a month left only. Guys, don't do this. Start your tests soon. Your first test will stun you and make you want to study a lot more. Don't worry about getting every little detail in the review books, those will come with practice. It's much more important to have that analytical mind. Those really specific random details account for maybe 5% of the bio section. Most of it is how well can you analyze the passage. So please, practice as many practice MCATs as you can. I took two TPRs, two kaplans, and five AAMCs.
When I got a question wrong, I looked it up and made sure I understood it. I did not let a question by unless I could destroy every concept it was related to afterwards. I also looked back to make sure I didn't just guess a question correctly.

* What did you think of the practice tests?

I hate the TPR tests. They're hard, and worse, they're obscure and intentionally way more tricky than the real thing. Not just tricky, but like stupidly tricky. Shit that they wouldn't do on the real mcat. They try to emphasize memorization and not analysis. The verbal is tailored to their strategies so you think they're working, and honestly they're a bit contradictory. My TPR practice test scores were 31, 33. TPR will generally give you lower scores than you will actually get.
Kaplan has good problems in that amazon book where they give you two tests. The questions are good, but the scaling is awful. Use it to identify weaknesses, but don't trust it as a benchmark. Kaplan will generally give you higher scores than you will actually get. I didn't actually count up my score with Kaplan because I scoffed at the scale (at least with PS. I didn't even look at the other scales.)
I liked AAMC ones, but only 8-11. 3 was a joke. The problem is, the real MCAT was more detailed. There was a lot more cell biology and DNA things. Microbiology and biochem were emphasized. But even though it was more detailed, I didn't feel like it was necessarily harder. Like, they weren't really tricky, there was just more info. I'm not sure about my average.

* Any general tips?

* Physics - Guys, please don't memorize specific equations for every situation. It will not work. I'll admit I have an edge in physics as a math major, but it's the best thing I can say. Please try to memorize only a select few and derive things from it. Like with kinematics, all you NEED is X, V, and A. You can find anything else with these three equations. I don't want you to think ""Oh in this situation I'd use...."" That's a bad mentality; you will run out of brainspace.

* Gen Chem - Not my strongest subject, but the same tips in physics hold.

I found the PS section on the real MCAT was a bit harder than my practices, but my score came out higher.

* Verbal - The only tip I have is hold your pace, and after every paragraph, take 2 seconds and sum it up in your head with one sentence. It'll help keep you on track and focused. Honestly, I was blown away by this verbal score. I found the VR section on the real MCAT was much more straightforward, but with longer passages. My score came out higher.

* Bio - My BS was lower, and honestly it was because of stupid mistakes I made in bio on the BS section. Like, I said the pituitary gland was an exocrine gland (stupid) and I let my overthinking mess up a few problems. But otherwise, know molecular genetics really well. The real bio sections had two passages adapted from papers, which made them a lot more dense. This caused me to freak out a little bit. DOn't let this happen to you. I found the bio was harder on the real thing, but not because of obscure facts. The analysis was the hard part. My bio score came out lower.

* Orgo - Ahh my favorite! Guys, organic chemistry can all be summarized in like two sentences: Things like to react to become more stable things, and resonance makes things more stable. Don't learn reactions. Don't learn mechanisms. Rather, learn how mechanisms WORK. Why does that base extract the alpha hydrogen on an enol to form an enolate? It's not important that it does, it's important WHY it does. My MCAT didn't have a lot of orgo on it, it kind of pissed me off. There was some biochem, but that's not really orgo :/

* A general tip -- A math major tries to memorize as little as possible and derive everything from as little as possible. This is the best advice I can give you, as it will make you understand everything a lot better. It's like that Bill Gates quote ""I always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because he will find an easy way to do it""

* OH and if anyone cares: Writing - This is not a humanities essay. Do not try to be eloquent. Be clear, direct, and most importantly, consistent. This is about how well can you formulate an argument and stay consistent with it. Do not contradict yourself in any circumstance. Use real-world examples, and include a supporting example in the first paragraph. If you find an opportunity to split one paragraph up into two, take it. It will help your essay stand out. Take five minutes before you even start writing to formulate your rule. They will tell you a situation. You will think ""This is true in this, this, and this case, but the line is drawn here, where it is no longer true."" Stay very, very consistent with that. Then look at your essay, as if you didn't write it, and instead it was written by that douche in your class who you hate. Pick out things that you can attack, and then fix it.
Do not freak out. Don't spiral. THis is a hard test and it's meant to be hard. Hell, I thought it went so badly, I almost VOIDED it. It's ok to be stumped by a lot of them, and to be unsure on a lot of them. It's a thinking test. No question is meant for you to be like ""Oh, I remember reading that, I'll just regurgitate it.""


* Finally, get a good night's sleep. I say this, but I know it won't happen. I didn't get any sleep, and to compensate, I drank a cup (read: a cup, not a shot) of espresso. I was so wired when I got there, I literally could not stop shaking. It wore off when I got to bio, and I was really sleepy. The entire rest of the day, I was sleepy, but I couldn't sleep because I like, overdosed on caffeine. I was nauseous, and it was generally awful. So get some sleep. Also, try to be one of the first people in bio. I'm not saying move on from a section early (good god, do not do this. If you have any spare time, re-read your questions.) But maybe cut a few breaks short. I say this because it's really annoying to do your verbal when everyone else is typing away, even with the mufflers.

I can clarify on any things also, just ask.

Edit: I wanted to add one more comment. I was expressing concern about how I might not do well in medical school because I dislike memorization so much to a physician I shadowed. He told me this and it really stuck with me.

""Yes there's memorization. But what you memorize is a road map. After you've got the road map memorized, it's really how you can use the map that displays how good of a doctor you are. The bad doctors might be able to memorize the entire road map, down to the last tree, but if they can't use it to figure out how to get from point A to point B, they'll fail as doctors.""

I don't know why, but I really liked that comment. I thought maybe you guys would too. I may have paraphrased it a bit, it was a while ago.


EDIT again: Guys, thank you so much for all the congratulations. It made me feel really good. I always try to not tell people about what I do because I've always felt like no one wants to hear it. I'm glad to see such comradery among premeds. It's rare in today's world.",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,1340255010.0,,,True,t3_vcphu,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/vcphu/my_mcat_score_came_back/,

I wrote this many years ago and forgot that I had done so until reading posts about the MCAT on this subreddit. This is probably a little outdated so take things with a grain of salt. I hope I do not come off as a total douche in posting this, and I figure it has been enough years that people I know will have forgotten it. Now...just wait till you guys have to take the Step 1, that'll be the REAL DEAL. 
_______
My MCAT advice:

This test is your enemy. This is the stupid bureaucratic hurdle that
says nothing about you, but ends up up defining you. It should mean
nothing but ends up meaning everything. You should be furious at this
test, at the AAMC, at every systematic folly that governs it. You want
to destroy this test, and the way you do so is by showing them that it
does not faze you. Be angry, but don't let the anger consume you.
Funnel it.

DO NOT let the first bunch of AAMC tests fool you, they are quite
different from the actual test as they are chopped from pre-CBT tests.
Tests 8, 9, and 10 are, however, very similar to the actual test. DO
take these seriously, they're the best practice. On the old ones, my
score would range from a 26 to a 36, NOT in any chronological order. 

Don't let it freak you out too much. If you do worse than you expect,
regroup. Call your best friends. Complain about the MCAT for 3
minutes, talk about things that are actually important for 30 minutes,
and reminisce about how the old days were great but the future will be even greater for 45 minutes. Go for a drive, breathe. Then, slowly but decisively, and on the same day, get back to the MCAT, and work twice as hard as you did the last time.

The things that make me tired or frustrated arent necessarily simply
related to the misery of the given situation as much as the constancy
or inescapablity of it. Change things up, study in different places
once in a while. Between MCAT sections, find a way to reset yourself,
this is very important. Go look at the horizon if its nice outside, or
listen to the rain, or look at pictures of folks you love, or meditate
on something simple or dark and constant. On the real test, you need
be able to think that you're starting a whole new test every time a
break comes up, instead of simply continuing on one arduously long
exam. Imagine you're in a different environment, time, anything. Don't think, ""This test is keeping me from the people I love, the things I care to do, the places I want to be"". Think, ""Soon it'll be over, and
all of this will come back"". Or better, think, ""Soon everything won't
simply be back to normal. Things will be better, because all things
being equal, at least the MCAT is gone."" The things that really matter
will be your reward for success. Every little bit helps.

Chronology/Practical Matters:

Study Materials: TPR books and online tests, Examkrackers review
books, AAMC practice tests.

I started actually studying in November, just a little bit every day.
My big thing was using flashcards, I'd write all my notes from the
Examkrackers books (which I highly recommend) on flashcards instead of notebooks. Its more portable, quicker to get through, and promotes quick decisive recall. You can use flashcards for abstractions, just be patient with yourself. In the end I had too many to count, which means they were no longer portable or quick to get through, but still they are useful.

Come December I memorized pretty much all of the bold/underlined bits of the examkrackers bio, and ochem, and most of the TPR/examkrackers equations and such for Phys/Chem. I have a very poor memory for discrete facts, so I had to use alot of mnemonics to get through it all. Make mnemonics that are memorable to you specifically, use nasty words, sexual allusions, hell anything you can muster to make sure you never forget 'em. Examkrackers is still too much information to know all of it, so understand general concepts, the way it may appear on the test, and then memorize all of the equations. It DOES help to know how to derive the equations, since alot of the MCAT involves juggling the equations around to fit whatever the passage requires.

I think Bio is essentially a glorified Verbal section. If you read
thoroughly enough, and can notice the patterns in the passages well
enough, I think you can manage to get 65-70% correct. You should be
aiming for 85% correct to get a great score. Thus, only 15-20% is
actually helped by discrete prior information! HOWEVER, you can take
the test much faster if you are well versed in bio/ochem. Memorize all
of the underlined and orange parts of the examkrackers Bio and Ochem books, or the pertinent parts of the TPR books. Ochem flashcards do help alot.

The writing section is totally stupid. It is designed to make you
tired before the Bio section. If you place importance on it, it will
be important, which will make you worry about it, which will make you tired. The key is, if you can write like a logical English speaking
human being, do not place importance on this section. Don't care at
all.

January, I started to take tons and tons of practice tests. Use the
TPR or non-AAMC tests to gauge what you're weak at, but don't let them demoralize you. I think i broke a 30 on the TPR tests like once,
they're ridiculously hard. I hear the Kaplan tests are easier, so
watch out, but I still think they'd be harder than the actual MCAT. If
you know the relevant material, and a question/passage is still beyond
impossible, it probably is unrealistic and isn't worth dwelling over
in anything but a cursory manner. Trust yourself. Keep a total of the
stupid/avoidable errors you are making per test. Practice more and
watch this number decline. The key is not to know everything there is
to know, that's impossible. The key is to get the above error rate to
zero. This is very possible. Remember: 85% correct!

By Mid-Jan, I started to get sick of the studying and just started to
relax. I figured, I perform best when i'm relaxed, sane, and
confident. I'm the most relaxed, sane and confident when I'm
surrounded by my friends or family, so I spent some of the time I
should have spent with them anyway catching up. Thank them, for loving and understanding your situation in the face all the neglect you've afforded them. Rock out on the guitar, or guitar hero if you wish.

Listen to some John Mayer, some Cannibal Corpse, or a bit of Bjork,
whatever makes you feel good. I went into the test caring enough to
concentrate, but not enough to worry. First, worrying will hinder your
performance, and second, the test is not worth worrying about. I'd
suggest finding your own way of keeping yourself in this thinly
defined state. The MCAT is meaningless in the way it defines you, and
nearly arbitrary in its attempts to do so. Things that matter should
never be meaningless, or arbitrary. Your single sitting of the MCAT
does not matter as much as they tell you it does. This is what makes
it conquerable.

TL;DR - It's a mental game. Hone your mind, use your resources well, and do not fear.  ",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,True,t3_1bp424,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1bp424/my_old_advice_for_my_friends_taking_the_mcat/,

Having one bad semester (or year) in undergrad does not keep you from going to med school.  I've seen several posts over the past week or so of people asking if they've screwed themselves over by dropping their GPA to roughly 3.5 or a little lower.  No, you have absolutely not.

Let's talk for just a quick minute about what [most] med schools use GPA for.  Your GPA and MCAT are used as a first pass to see which applications get a closer look.  I can't tell you if schools have hard cut-offs (above a certain GPA and above a certain MCAT) or if they use a sliding scale (with a particular GPA, you must have above a particular MCAT), but this is what most use it for.  Once you have those, then the rest of your application gets scrutinized more closely.  At most places, I would imagine that a 3.5 GPA gets you that closer look.  I can't tell you that this is what every med school does, but I do know that there are several that do, and it makes sense.

If you want to go to medical school, then don't ask a bunch of people on the internet if you should give up on it.  A lot of people on this subreddit are very helpful with giving advice and providing support.  That is the awesome thing about this subreddit.  But don't ask a bunch of people who you don't even know - and who really have little to no knowledge of the inner workings of the adcoms - whether or not you should give up.  That's BS.

I applied straight out of undergrad with, to be blunt, a very strong academic record.  Got some interviews, got wait-listed at 3 places.  Didn't get in.  I could have given up, but I still wanted to be an MD.  So I worked for a year, shored up the application, applied again.  Got 2 interviews, got 2 acceptances (long story as to why I got fewer interviews with a stronger application, but it had to do with AMCAS screwing me over).  In less than two weeks, I'm going to receive my MD.  In about a month and a half, I'll start my residency in emergency medicine.  If you want it, go after it.

So I got the email today that I was accepted to a US medical school off of the wait-list! Here's my application info, for those of you who are interested:

* MCAT: 30P (Taken in August)
* Application Submission Date: Mid September
* Apps ""complete"" at all schools: Mid November (Really late, would not recommend)
* 17 applications, 3 Interviews (Top 10, Top 50, Unranked). Denied, Deferred (still hoping!), WL to Accepted.
* LORs: 5, from Poetry, Calculus, Geology, Biochemistry professors, and one from my PI. I really made the effort to get to know my professors, and spent a lot of time in office hours and asking questions after class. Half my interviewers mentioned that my letters were exceptional, and that they really made me stand out. So letters do matter, get good ones!
* GPA: First school: 3.89
* Second School (higher ranked than first school was): Was a 3.3 at time of submission, will be &gt;3.6 at time of graduation (hopefully). 
* **I had a C+ in physics and a B- in vector calculus. I also had 3 Ws freshman year.**

EDITING for more info!
 
ECs: 

* I spent every friday for a year shadowing in the same endocrinology clinic for 3 hours or so, at my universities academic hospital. That's the sum of my shadowing and clinical hours.

* Volunteer hours are a little trickier to calculate, but they're all the same sort of thing. I generally spent a lot of time doing free tutoring, and when I had the time i would guest-lecture in my mum's inner-city classroom. I never went out of my way to find things to put on my application, I just did what I was passionate about (I did these things before I even decided to become pre-med). It averaged about 4 hrs/week since 2010 for the free tutoring (taking into account the weeks where it was much much more, and the weeks where it was almost nothing), and 2 hours a week for the classroom work. I specified in the descriptions that it wasn't 2 hrs/week every week, but rather when I was on break or had a day off or two. I also spent two summers volunteering in a lab at Caltech, but I put that as research experience.

* My other meaningful activities were art (freelance work as well), piano, and swimming (with a bit of coaching). I wrote one of my secondaries about the similarities between art and medicine, and my main personal statement about the experiences shadowing that led me to want to pursue a certain specialty.  

Good luck to all the applicants for the upcoming cycle, and for those of you who are still waiting to hear back for this cycle! If anybody has any questions, feel free to ask! Now I'm off to yell at all the people who told me I couldn't do this!

I and I’m sure the other moderators here have no issue with these discussions taking place here. All the members here try and help with their wonderful (mostly) advice and feedback. 

Now it’s time to get into the meat and potatoes of this post.

It’s that time of year rejection season, finals, midterms, MCAT scores, etc. People are starting to feel down and losing hope. I’ve been through the rat race that is premed, I’ve seen it and done it. I’ve been where most of you have been.  I’ve had friends that have been in the same situations. The one lesson that I’ve learned from all of this is the following:

KNOW WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP; DON’T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP

Now we do a great job of that here with people asking for help and people providing wonderful answers. 

BUT

Nothing replaces the resources available to every single one of you at your schools. Your counseling departments. These are trained individuals that are there to help you. They have seen all of this and can help you get through your troubles. They can provide a sympathetic ear, a sounding board, and solutions in many cases.

PLEASE go to these individuals and talk to them if you are having troubles or feeling stressed. 

I’m sure that I am not the only person here who has lost friends for many reasons some personal, some stress related, and some that are out of our control. Everyone is facing a difficult battle. Be nice to your friends, be a sympathetic ear. Make sure your friends know that you are there to support them and that they can come to you with anything. 

Use the resources available to you, and don’t get too caught up in the rat race that you forget about what is most important. Be a nice person and be there to help someone when they need it. Trust me when I say you will regret it for a long time if you realize you weren’t there when you should have been there.

I’ve been meaning for a while to post this but I haven’t been able to figure out how to say it. This is about as eloquently as I can put it.

To preface, this tip requires an MP3 player that syncs with iTunes as well as an apple computer running OS X Lion. 

The link I provided provides a how to. Basically I convert my typed notes, whether the notes are on a recently reviewed practice test, content review notes on meiosis, muscle contraction, etc., or even physics concepts on projectile motion, magnetism etc. into an MP3 track on iTunes. sometimes its even useful to just look up a concept on wikipedia and then drag bits and pieces into a pdf to convert and listen to later. 

 I'm a bit of an auditory learner and I have ~1 hour commute to work. It's like listening to a personally tailored lecture on weakness areas that you may chose to brush up on. Even if you don't commute its sometimes  useful to listen while working out, walking the dogs, cleaning dishes, any number of mindless activities.

**TL:DR** convert your typed notes into an audio track and listen to concepts during mindless activities that may take up one's day

What I used to prepare:

ExamKrackers 101 Passages

TPR Hyperlearning Verbal Workbook

Lots of reading very dense online articles and books (Atlantic and New Scientist is a good place to start. I read a lot of the economist articles and literary journals and science journals as well.) I also have read a lot of nonfiction since middle school and attribute most of my success to that.

I practiced speedreading by plugging the articles into spreeder and increasing the speed every few days.

I was able to get my time to complete an entire section down to under 27 minutes, effectively giving me the ability to go through the entire verbal section twice.

1355608262.0,50,self.premed,14wtzw,Part 5: The Interview,ThePremedGuide,61,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/14wtzw/part_5_the_interview/,"I am starting with part 5 because a few people PMed me asking for tips for their upcoming interviews, so I thought I might as well write this first.

So you’ve been invited to the interview, **sincere congratulations**. You’ve made it past quite possibly the biggest cut for that specific school and you’re one giant leap closer to being a medical student. However, this is where you secure your spot at a school; this is where you solidify the school’s confidence that (1) you are capable of handling the medical student load, (2) are truly dedicated to lifelong service as a physician, and (3) can relate and interact with people. If you can convince them of these three things, I believe that you should receive an acceptance.

**Attire**

Admittedly, I truly believe in the whole (proper English be damned) “look good, play good” philosophy. You need to walk into the room as well-dressed as possible. A lot of you might not need to read this section, but for those of you who struggle with understanding of what “business formal” entails, it’s quite simple. 
	
Buy a suit if you do not own one. I understand this can be expensive but I’m not advocating going to Barney’s and spending a small fortune. A suit will come in handy for more than just this interview. 

No suits are to be worn straight off the hanger, get it tailored. Three things are important when buying a suit jacket: the length of the arms, the length of the coat, and the “arm holes.” These are tough to tailor and should be well fitting. The pants can be brought up and slimmer. Neutral, darker tones are the best IMHO: black, charcoal, dark grey, or dark brown (although not my favorite suit color). Tie a good knot, I like the “Pratt Knot” personally, it is more symmetrical than a Four-In-Hand and Half-Windsor but not as wide as a Full-Windsor. Get your hair cut and be clean shaven. You want the interviewer to understand that you can not only take care of a patient, but take care of yourself.

Check out /r/malefashionadvice. Just look through some of the pictures and guides. They really have an amazing knowledge of fashion and you can get some great ideas from there. But a few last minute tips:

* Your tie should touch your belt. I put the tip of my tie to rest somewhere near the top of my belt.
* Never button the bottom button on a suit jacket.
* If you’re having trouble with the awkward “tie is not snug in the collar” problem, undo the top button on your shirt and tighten your tie. This will eliminate the problem 90% of the time. 
* Match your belt leather with your shoe leather, and match any metals on your body.

More tips couresty of /u/johnnyscans 

* Fit in the shoulders is hands down the most important part of a suit jacket. Sleeve length can be changed quite easily. The jacket can be taken in and shortened. Nothing can be done to change the way a jacket flows off the shoulders. To test if a jacket fits in the shoulders put it on and lean your shoulder into a wall. You (not the pad) should make contact first.
* Charcoal suit = black shoes. Blue suit = brown shoes. While the opposites work, they're more fashion forward and not as ""safe"".
*Get your shirts tailored. Taking in a shirt is child's play for a tailor. You may very well end up out of your jacket (be it when eating or something else) and you want to make sure it doesn't look like you're wearing your big brother's shirt.
* Shine your shoes. Patients are going to judge you based on your appearance. You better believe your interviewers are going to do the same damn thing.
* Get some Crest White Strips and take care of any bad breath issues.


*FOR WOMEN*: Courtesy of /u/beediie 

Female med student here, figured I'd add to the attire section! Professional attire is pretty straightforward for women, but I thought it may be helpful to let you know what I've experienced both in my interviews and seeing people interview at my school.

* The interview is business professional - suits (like [these](http://i.imgur.com/FRoFz.jpg) ) are definitely the most appropriate choice. Note that there is a difference between this and business casual, so I would personally avoid dresses. Even work-appropriate ones.
* Either a skirt or pants are fine, but please keep in mind that if you are wearing a skirt, it should not be too tight or go above your knees (whether sitting or standing, make sure to test this).
* Definitely wear a blazer, such as [this one](http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=87056&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=421702002). It doesn't need to be that expensive, but make sure it looks nice and that it matches your suit.
* Heels or flats are appropriate, but make sure they are comfortable and professional. Black or nude pumps are usually the best choice and use your discretion when it comes to heel height.
* Choose good quality clothes - I personally like LOFT, Banana Republic, JCrew, and Gap. And I usually stick to very basic items so I can wear them interchangeably. At the time, it can be frustrating to spend money on these clothes, but if you are accepted, you WILL wear them often. If you make the investment now, you won't have to later. Plus, you'll look great :)

**Preparatory reading** 

Disregard everything you believe about this because it is no longer optional, it is necessary. You don’t need to read the NEJM for a month or memorize the Hippocratic Oath, you need to read a synopsis of the ACA. Almost every interviewer I had asked me about my opinion about it, what I would change about it, or what I loved about it. It will affect your life as a doctor, and is quite possibly the biggest thing that will happen to healthcare in our generation. [This] (http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx)  is what I read and it was more than enough to answer any questions, form an opinion, and get a decent grasp on how it will affect physicians (look in the comments, /u/a_real_md has an awesome writeup on this). Anecdotally, I was asked by two interviewers if I read, and what book I was reading at the moment (Game of Thrones for you fans out there), so that’s something to keep in your mind. 

**Understand your own application** 

Take a step back and look at your application. Where are you weak? Where are you strong? What is missing? What is something unique? Questions will come up about these things. In my case, I have a very strong research background and a weak clinical background. I was asked by multiple interviewers (9 of the 11) about my research and all of the interviewers about my weak clinical background. You need to understand how to effectively communicate why the weaknesses you have will not inhibit you as a physician. You need to delineate how your strengths will make you an effective physician. Also, people will just ask about unique quirks in your application. Did you put down that you love to paint? They might ask what your favorite subject is, or your favorite work of art, or your favorite artist.

You should be able to speak about everything on your application for 10-15 minutes. If you cannot, it probably should not have been on your application (I’ll touch on this in one of the other guides but since I'm going out of order, it should be stated).

**Schedule** 

This is an opinion section. I would always arrive in the city two days before my interview. I wanted to explore the city, find out where I could possibly be living for the next 4 years of my life. I needed to wander around the campus and get a feel for what it’s like to be a student there. I wanted to find a coffee shop and not feel rushed. A lot of people won’t have this luxury because school sucks and these trips are not cheap, but I encourage you to ensure that you not only love the school, but love the surroundings.


**Interview**

Arrive early. I typically arrived ~20 minutes before they told me to. To be early is to be on time, to be on time is to be late.  Every school works differently but you’ll typically have 2-3 interviews, a tour, and lunch (the latter two are typically accompanied by a M1 or M2 student).  A friend of mine gave me some great advice before my first interview: “Treat everyone as if they are a spy. You never know who is going to have a word on your application.” This isn’t to make you paranoid, but just to keep you humble and understand that the receptionist who leads you to the room or that M2 walking you around the campus is actually performing a covert interview.

Most of the time you’ll arrive and there will be other interviewees there mingling about. These people are not your enemies they are possibly your future classmates and friends. Talk, be open, be likeable. Are you a naturally quiet/shy person? Then be yourself, be the recipient of friendly banter or just listen in.

**Posturing** 

Stand up straight. Don’t roll your shoulders or slouch. You don’t need to be beaming the whole time, but be genuinely happy you’re at an interview and humble at the opportunity (because there are literally thousands of kids who would die to be in your spot). This is something that really bothered me in my visits. People had this grim look about in a lot of my interviews. I can guarantee a lot of it was anxiety, nervousness, or stress (which is understandable) but this is a time to be joyous! When gesturing, keep your hands in (what my father calls) the box: within the frame of your body, below the shoulders but above your belt. Look people in the eye and nod in both understanding and agreement.
	

**Don’t put yourself in the hole**

 Realize you’re speaking to a well-educated person who owns their own opinions. They can critique your arguments well, they can (and will) play devil’s advocate to see how you react and/or can reason, and they can quite possibly hold beliefs opposite your own on some of those inflammatory issues in medicine. You need to walk a fine line here: you need to understand that they are looking for you to take a stance but not impose your own stance/beliefs on others. You have an ethical obligation to object to something unethical (ie don’t be Dr. Mengele). I thought long and hard about this before I stepped into my first interview, and I was asked about these things.  Have it figured out yourself.

No “likes”, “ums”, “uhhs.” The latter are easily replaced with, “Hmm, that's an interesting question…” Don’t ramble: be concise. The biggest thing here is answer the question.  Part of my job now requires me to interview people, and incredibly often I will ask a question and the interviewee will not answer it or dance around it. This comes off terribly.  If you don’t understand, tell them that. Say, “I’m sorry I don’t really understand the question, can you say it again or slightly different?” This is much more acceptable than just spewing information that is completely off-topic.

**Confidence** 

I’m going to be honest here. You, madam or sir, are the shit. You are in the desirable 10% of the application pool (I just threw this number out there). Understand that. You are the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work. Hundreds of people throughout your life have invested time in you and it has bloomed, and it smells like the shit. But, you are still not a medical student, you are not a physician, you will not cure cancer. Be humbly confident. Be the David that knew he could slay Goliath with a few fuckin stones but don’t walk out and bash your shield. Be Brad Pitt as Achilles at the Battle of Thessaly in Troy, you’re deadly but you don’t make a show of walking out into the battleground. Be Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of Armies of the North, but go by the name Gladiator and don’t take your mask off as you mess shit up in the Coliseum.

**Post Interview**

This is probably the most personal-preference part of this post. A lot of people swear by “Thank You’s” and LOIs. I, personally, think “Thank You’s” are viewed as no more than a gesture and LOIs are a façade. However, I am a firm believe in necessary update letters. A lot of schools tell you what they want or don’t want in post-interview correspondence, so abide by those. If the school doesn’t have guidelines, if you get an award, a presentation, a publication (definitely this), or anything else that you think will turn the tide for your application, I think it’s worth it.  The committees understand that you are not the same exact person as you were on the date you turned your application in. You are not frozen in time, things will happen and they want to be made aware of things that might be game-changing. This also goes both ways. I have a friend charged with a DUI who was required to inform all of his schools last cycle. His offer was rescinded at one school. 

Well that’s it. I don’t have much more to say and I would greatly appreciate anyone’s input or thoughts on both my writing style and the content. Also, I contacted some of you who offered to help with the interview portion but no one responded, so if you want to help contribute, please PM this account and let me know. Also, I deleted my old account that I used to inquire about interest because of anonymity.

1336575009.0,47,self.premed,ter1k,Helpful tips for applying to medical school,Sentriculus,51,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/ter1k/helpful_tips_for_applying_to_medical_school/,"I wanted to compile a concise list of things I learned during the application cycle last year.  If the advice seems obvious to you, good--no one cares whether you state that opinion.  But feel free to offer your own suggestions or clarifications.

* Keep in mind that you must pay for both primary and secondary applications.  Primary apps on AMCAS will be $160 for the first school and $30 for every school after that.  If a school wishes you to send a secondary app, it can cost between $30-$120.  If your GPA and MCAT are not competitive, do not waste your money by applying to too many out-of-state schools. The out-of-state schools that are most likely to accept you are ones where your stats are above average and states in which you have familial ties. VCU sent me a secondary app request and once I sent in the app and $60, they sent me a rejection within 24-hours (it was just to get my money).

* Request letters of recommendation early in the process.  You do not need to get those letters from your undergraduate schools pre-medicine committee as long as you have 3 or more individual letters from faculty or supervisors who could represent your value to the admissions committee.  Keep bugging your rec-letter writers every few weeks as they tend to put it off.  Be sure to send thank you cards and/or treats when they have done their job as you might need their help next year too.

* If you are writing a long description for the extracurricular activities, personal statement, or secondary application answers, write and save all of it in a word document first.  This will keep your thoughts safe in case the computer freezes, you need those answers for other secondary apps, or you are not good at grammar.

* When typing out all of your grades, Pass/Fail classes receive the grade P or F.

* Minor speeding violations are not misdemeanors, because you did not have to go before a jury for that reckless driving charge.  Relax, a few traffic violations won't keep you out of medical school.

* You cannot edit the Letter of Recommendation writers once you have input that information.  Be sure you have received a confirmation from your selected rec-letter writer that they **will** do it before you put her/his name down.  Otherwise, you will have to type up why they cannot write your letter and send it to each school.

* Interviewers sometimes won't read your primary application until they have you seated in front of them.  Try to write descriptions of extracurricular activities clearly so that they could skim it on the fly as they interview you.

* Once you receive secondary apps, fill them out, proofread, and submit them with app fee **as soon as possible**.  This will determine how soon in the application process you get an interview.

* Practice for the interview with a medical student.  Make sure they will be someone who is brutally honest with you.  Consult many resources and practice question lists to have a mental bank of what you wish to say when the time comes.

Good luck to all the 2012-2013 applicants of both MD and DO! 

EDIT: changed fee to few.

1353266437.0,44,self.premed,13eq91,I know this has been discussed before but it really is ridiculous and a downright injustice.,ThaMastaBlasta,89,45,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/13eq91/i_know_this_has_been_discussed_before_but_it/,"Here are a couple graphs for the admission statistics for white students and for African-American students.

[Whites](http://i44.tinypic.com/2ytptlj.jpg)

[African-American](http://i40.tinypic.com/ayud6o.jpg)

In this day and age for one person to have an advantage this large over another person based ONLY on the color of their skin is an absolute travesty. I go to a university in a metro area with a racially diverse set of students, which has been a great experience. Having that said, it is so demoralizing to know that those students around me taking the exact same classes as me, with the same teachers and same opportunities, will be able to make B's and C's when I make A's and will still have a better chance of medical school acceptance than me just because they are not white. 


Lets look at the graphs I referenced. They show that an African-American student with a 3.50 gpa and a 25 MCAT score, which are considered well below average scores for MD matriculation overall, have a 75% chance of acceptance! Compare this to a white person with the exact same statistics and he is sitting at just over a 20% chance.


An African-American student with a 3.69 gpa and a **22 on the MCAT** still gets an acceptance to medical school **over 50% of the time!** I honestly do not think someone who scores a 22 on the MCAT is qualified to go to medical school AT ALL *no matter what race they are,* and yet over half of the black applicants with a 22 MCAT are getting in.


This makes me angry for more reasons other than it just being downright racial discrimination.

1. It is taking spots at medical schools away from students who are more deserving and who have worked harder.

2. It is devaluing and misrepresenting the MD degree for everyone else.

3. It further promotes racism by causing whites and Asians to automatically assume that a black student didnt have to meet the same requirements for medical school acceptance as they did. This further promotes feelings of discontent toward the minorities and discredits those black students who actually did earn their medical school acceptance.

I am white and come from a middle class family with no ties to medicine, both my parents are elementary school teachers. I haven't had any more advantages in my life than any of my other class mates with a different color skin. I have had to work jobs and take out loans to support myself in school and have still worked my butt off to get the best grades I can. I have heard the arguments that the minority students are more likely to return to the under-served communities after graduation, but there is no guarantee of that. I know of a lot of black students in my classes who come from MUCH better off families and communities than I do.

Sorry for the long rant but I just had to let my feelings be known on this issue. Of all the professions in the world, I would think that the medical field would be the one that should actually above playing the race card. Is who becomes a physician and who doesn't really something we want race to play a part in at all? No medical school is going to turn down an excellent applicant, no matter their race, why accept under-qualified applicants based on race then?

It's $20 for the online access (paper copies don't exist anymore, sorry) and will give the best general info on applicant statistics, deadlines, pre-med requirements, and program details. 

2) The process is a crapshoot, and it's really not all about numbers. Pick the schools that you like, for location, program, atmosphere, or otherwise. Don't be intimidated by high stats. Good LOR's and a great personal statement can compensate for squiffy numbers. I got interviews at schools for which I was well below their 10th percentile for MCAT, and didn't get offered interviews at some schools I was quite qualified for. It's really a crapshoot. 

3) If your numbers are fantastic, don't apply to too many lower-teir schools. Often, they will reject you solely on the assumption that you'll get accepted somewhere better, and won't attend if they do accept you. I know of many people who attended top-tier schools, and were often rejected from lower tier ones without interview.

EDIT: Some good points brought up below:

4) Fantastic stats don't guarantee anything. I once spoke with a top 10 AdCom, who mentioned that he rejects kids with 40 MCATs regularly because he doesn't think they have the social skills to interact with patients. Also, keep in mind that schools are much more aware of their class environment than you are. You can be the nicest person in the world, but if they know their class is full of pretentious gunners, they may not accept you because they don't think you'll fit in with the rest of the class, regardless of everybody's stats. 

The same AdCom who mentioned the advice above also admitted that if he's having a bad day, he's not likely to look favorably on any of the interviewees for that day. What it comes down to is: AdComs are human too. They're not perfect robots designed to make flawless decisions and character judgements. Decisions aren't always fair, and you might not get the acceptance you deserve. If you get rejected, there might not be anything wrong with you or your application, you may have just had a shitty luck of the draw. However, it is important to be truly introspective when you evaluate your rejections before your second application. If you got rejected because your lack of social skills during the interview, practice! If you got rejected because you're actually a jerk, try to fix that before you try again. It's not always just about improving your shadowing hours and MCAT scores, sometimes you have to improve your own character before you can be a successful doctor.

Cool, people who are about to suffer four years along side me; this oughta be fun."" Well, it wasn't all that fun. It was insane! The constant judging... I was asked my SAT about 10 times over the span of an hour; I was asked my AP scores, and when I just said ""oh mostly 5s, one or two 4s,"" the other people go off on a tangent about how they thought APs were so easy. I mean, I'm not talking about APs or anything here, but it was crazy how much self inflation and boosting there was over there. Eventually, I think people tried to put me down about 6 times (not me in general, the put-downs were in the air and hit most people). It wasn't explicit, but it was pretty scary how implied it all was. Instead of ""my grades are bigger than yours"" it was more the ""Oh, *just* that? Well, that's cool I guess."" It seemed just about everyone had the same experience, and most of the people were participating in this sorta stuff. Does it ever peter down, or even eventually stop? I don't know. But if it doesn't, I'm pretty scared for the next four years.


It was a very interesting experience though. ",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,1374985147.0,,,True,t3_1j6tms,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1j6tms/premeds_are_scary/,

Since the MCAT is soon approaching for a lot of us, how about we make a thread compiling all of the tips we've developed over our own studying.

**Verbal**

1. Verbal is all about the author. After reading a passage, you should really understand the author's stance on the passage and be able to answer questions as if you are the author. This means that oftentimes there is a ""right"" answer choice that is wrong not factually but because it is not in the passage or not in line with the author's views. 

2. One thing that helped me a lot was to not go into each passage blind (meaning not knowing what the passage is about). First, skim a question before reading a passage (like really skim, so you just read key words) and then go to the bottom of the passage and read the title. Now you know what the passage is about without having to read anything in the passage itself!

3. This one really helped me out but it might not be for you. I am a really fast reader but I oftentimes dont understand things I just read. What I did to combat this is highlight (underline if you are not using a computer/AAMC practice test) the main word/phrase of each sentence of the passage. The main word isn't just what the sentence is about, rather, it is what does this sentence add to the passage? Is there a word which strengthens the authors argument? Is there a phrase which supports a counter argument? Does this phrase reference a new idea? Breaking down each passage into sentences and tackling the sentences one by one helps me a lot.

4. Some questions you will figure out right away. Other ones are harder. If you find yourself stuck on a question, do the question backwards! This means instead of looking for the right answer start marking off wrong answers. Verbal is awesome in that there are a couple of wrong answers that you should be able to mark off: There is usually one ridiculous answer that is clearly wrong (opposite of what the passage is saying). Mark it off. There is usually one answer that would be right except it is not supported by the passage. Mark it off. If it is a roman numeral problem, see which roman numeral appears in two of the answer choices (so like a) I and II or b) II and III, look at II). If this is right or wrong, you can cross out the other answers accordingly.

Anyone have any great tips to add to the verbal or the BS/PS sections?",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,1368121935.0,,,True,t3_1dzgwf,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1dzgwf/mcat_tips_reddits_one_stop_shop/,

I'm not an English major and my PS was not a Pulitzer Prize winner but I just thought my thoughts might help a few people.  (if I read your PS please don't take these comments personally. They are NOT directed towards any one person b/c I didn't include something that I only saw once)

Slight problems I'm seeing:


1. ""I saw Elizabeth Walters in Chicago Hospital on April 15th"" HIPAA! HIPAA! HIPAA!!!! You cannot use names and you cannot use any identifying information. Even if you change the name, you still need to change identifying characteristics!! You can't say ""An actress whom I'll call Jane who is married to Brad Pitt and starred in Tomb Raider."" Yes, you changed the name but we still all know you're talking about Angelina Jolie.  Also, did the doctor you shadowed give you permission to use her name?

2. ""After studying and volunteering, I'm totally ready to be a doctor."" No you're not and neither am I =) I'm not trying to be a jerk but adcoms already see plenty of people with god-complexes. I like to think that I'm ready to be a doc but if a doctor heard me say that he'd laugh in my face, and rightfully so. We can be excited and have prepared as much as we possibly can but let's be real/modest here.

3. Pretty narratives. It's hard to avoid this, but just be careful. I'm talking about the ""As I looked over Ms. Miller's bloated body and the IV drips snaking out of her arm..."" sort of sentences. Yes it creates a nice image and can convey what you're feeling but just be thoughtful when you use these. 

4. ""I've wanted to be a doctor ever since I emerged from my mother's vagina."" Ok, great, but you better back that up. Are you looking forward to the smell of gangrenous flesh in the OR? Is your dream job to be telling a patient with a virus that he really doesn't need antibiotics for the 15th time? Have you ever fought with an insurance company? Hey, who doesn't love the threat of a lawsuit after 72 hours of sleepless nights! I'm not questioning people's lifelong desires but you need to show that you know that being a doctor is more than being that sexy guy/gal on TV in a bitchin' white coat.

5. ""I want to be a doctor because I want to help people."" Augh! Then why don't you volunteer to babysit for a single mother while she finishes her bachelor degree? This is actually not something I've seen but Flagellaa's post made me think about it. A lot of people have been really good about explaining why they want to be a doctor, but I just wanted to throw this in there. (that's an example of things people have been doing well)

If I read your PS, I'm sorry it took so long to get back to you! I think I replied to everyone but if you haven't heard from me, please, please message me. Also, if you haven't sent me your essay, yes you can send it and I'd be happy to read it.  I had a lot of help with my application so this is my way of paying it forward. I also think this sort of thing builds a nice sense of community.

1376349725.0,29,self.premed,1k8ola,The reasons you should seriously consider shadowing trauma surgery.,Hardac_,36,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1k8ola/the_reasons_you_should_seriously_consider/,"I'll start with some of the more obvious reasons. You get to see some pretty awesome stuff, and gives you ample opportunity to get over any problems you may have with blood and gore. With that said, don't worry when you get faint, a lot of people do, its just how you handle it that makes the difference.

You really have the opportunity to see what a day in the hospital of a surgery resident is like. You have the chance to stay on call in the hospital, spend a night studying while they give you a pager waiting for a trauma to come in, or hang out and watch Netflix until there's something to see. With all of the attendings going home for the night, you get to hear what its REALLY like.

During the days, you either get rushed with a bunch of trauma cases during rush hour traffic, or you get to follow physicians perform many wide varieties of operations. 

Most importantly, and its the reason I actually thought of writing this for those interested enough in reading it, is simply the amount of the hospital you really observe. 
So, the trauma team gets a page on their beeper informing them of a trauma I. Everyone rushed down to the Emergency Department to see what's going on. 

1 - You get to see how the ED really functions. How triaging works and the many different techs, physicians, and paperwork is handled.

After the patient is stabilized (and if they aren't immediately you get to see true trauma surgery, but that's beside the point) you follow them to have their CT scan taken.

2 - You get to observe the vast amount of diagnostic tools used for patients, CT scans, x-rays, ultrasound, and if you're lucky a MRI.

After the scan is taken, you follow the residents to the radiology department.

3 - You get to see how radiology functions. You have the chance, albeit limited, to talk to radiologists and see their working conditions and exactly what they do.

Then depending on what radiology says, the patient gets the appropriate treatments.

4 - The sheer amount of consults for trauma is really the best part. Patients often undergo orthopaedic surgery, ENT, neurology, neurosurgery, plastic surgery and even pharmacy. You are in an amazing position to really see every branch of medicine.

Before or after consulted surgeries, patients are brought to the Trauma ICU.

5 - You get to witness what true critical care is concerned with. In addition, how vital a good nursing staff is to the function of the hospital.

6 - You can learn about rounding with physicians, how they handle patients and families, what is expected of medical students and residents, and how incredibly knowledgeable attending physicians truly are.

7 - During the days where you're not following a physician with trauma and ICU duty, you can see how clinics are handled, scheduling and general patient check up.

If you really show up with genuine interest you can get some amazing letters of recommendation, actively participate in procedures (nothing serious, but for example holding a patients head still while the surgeons perform a tracheostomy.) 

Plus, its cool stories for the future, and will surely help you decide if surgery is even a remote interest of yours.


There you have my $0.02. I hope someone takes my advice and has the same amazing experience I had with trauma. I received two letters from different trauma surgeons and my interviewer made it a point to tell me they were incredible letters. You really can shine in that type of situation where there is so much to learn. Also, don't be worried about following around a single doctor, it won't happen. You'll have lunch with some, observe surgeries with others, and sit  in the ICU with even more. They do talk to each other.

Oh, one last piece of advice, and I think this goes for any shadowing. Make it a commitment. For the first month I didn't get a time of day from the attending physicians. Afterwards, they made it a point to know my name, involve me with everything, and help your overall understanding.

Good luck!

Edit: So of you have asked how you can get into it. Sorry to not consider the question beforehand. I'll paste my reply.

You can start by emailing the physicians asking for their time. However, that is, as I'm sure you're all aware of, rarely replied.

What I did, and would recommend, was just show up to their secretary and let your intentions be known. There is a lot of paperwork associated with it, so they need to be let known first. Afterwards, just show up to the unit with open ears and open eyes.

If this doesn't work the first time, and it probably wont, show up again. If you bug them enough, and you may need to, they will see how serious you are about it and will in turn want to help you.

To elaborate on that, I started emailing random trauma surgeons on the hospital's website. I got 0 replies. Not a single one, I wasn't going to give in, so I figured out where to go.

Showing incentive goes a very very long way.

When I first discovered this subreddit there were maybe 500 subscribers, and now there are more than 2K. Awesome!

However, recently, I've been noticing the same general questions coming up very often. You know, the whole ""just entering college, any advice?"" or ""3rd year in college. I'm doing this this and this. Should I do anything else?"" Although I understand how you could be looking for encouragement and more direction, you are on the internet, and with this subreddit and SDN alone, you can find most of the answers to those questions very easily. I've been noticing more of these general questions coming up over and over again, and the subreddit started to sound like a broken record.

Could we dial down on the general questions seeking for general advice, and gear towards more specific items and cases? You can probably find the answers to ""is volunteering important?"" either here or SDN just by searching around for a few minutes, but we could have motivational threads like ""finals week - let's remind ourselves why we wanted to go into medicine"" or links to the recent healthcare debate article, etc. There is so much to talk about other than subjects that have been discussed over and over again. Maybe we can have one thread where all the ""what are my chances"" go as well.

If I'm the only person who feels like this, I'm fine with that. But just in case this was a growing concern in the community, I wanted to put it out there. 

Edit: Let me clarify something real quick. I am not saying we should stop asking for advice, but let's go for specific ones.

1344004076.0,33,self.premed,xmck9,What I learned from /r/premed in 6 months,,39,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/xmck9/what_i_learned_from_rpremed_in_6_months/,"Make sure you know what 4 year university you would like to go to. Many states have programs in order for people who graduate from community colleges in state with their AS (Associate of Science) to easily transfer in to a university in that state. If you plan to get two years under your belt then transfer to a 4 year, make sure you work closely with an advisor. They'll help you choose courses that will transfer. 

If you are top of your class and have a really great work ethic, while putting in a lot of work outside of academics (internships, volunteering, and leadership roles in student organizations) then you are really not going to have a problem with that debt. You're going to be scooped up by somebody; it's the 'average' student that really gets the shaft in these economic times.

Things students told that are not true and are **not** an edge: Clubs, Honor society membership. **GPA and MCAT are the most important things**.


Things that can make a difference and give you an edge: 

**University Science courses** (CC even with A's does not give advantage and some schools unofficially will not accept students with all CC science premed) (the Ivy League school factor only if your GPA is above average for applying) 


**Volunteering/Shadowing** (I do not believe that you can be accepted without doing this) I'd suggest getting some volunteer experience. Volunteerism, especially in medicine, looks very good and is necessary in some places. Most hospitals have volunteer departments and can set you up with something. Also, it's more important to be consistent than the actual time spent. You'll want to say you volunteered for an entire year somewhere, even if it's just two or three hours a week, rather than spending whole days for only a few weeks. The important thing is to cover all sorts of different areas of healthcare to demonstrate that you had experienced as much of the field as possible. Whatever you can get inside a hospital or office to observe and interact with doctors which would be beneficial and probably would be the best course of action. Some shadowing of all types of medical professionals will help. You need clinical volunteering, you need leadership roles. Social anxiety is not an excuse in the eyes of admissions committees so you best be sure you can handle the stress. Start this as early as possible in your undergrad since, during your last year, you will have less free time. 


**High GPA and High MCAT preferably** You need to do the MCAT which (for normal people) requires 2-3 months of studying and a financial and time investment in MCAT books. You also need to score over 30, unless your GPA is high enough to compensate for a lower score. To score over 30 means to be in the 85th or higher percentile of test takers. Take the MCAT when the time is right. Summer is the best time to study for the MCAT as it is difficult to handle schoolwork while consistently studying at the same time. Ideally, you take the MCAT during the summer after sophomore year, or, if you are taking a gap year, summer after junior year works as well. Start getting your application ready. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is submit a subpar application early vs. a well polished one later. Take the time the time to let your PS develop and evolve into something that will stand out among the 10,000+ applications that a school will receive. Strong writing takes time and shouldn't be rushed - the benefit of turning it in early is quite marginal.

**Research/Lab experience** - volunteer in one of your university's labs.

**Letter of Recommendations**: Build relationships with your professors. Read their research, and find excuses to talk to them. Talk in class as often as possible, and if you see them around campus, chat them up. Then if you don't have legitimate reasons to see them during office hours, study harder until you get to some level at which you need them to explain things. 

Things you should know: Any major is fine. No time frame, if it takes you 5 or 6 years to get to applying fine. MCAT is offered all year no set time, no set year in college to take it, take it when ready. Any University is fine (Not CC or plain College but Uni)

To try to map out how to accomplish such a task, I thought of all the major things premeds had to accomplish to just apply, let alone be accepted to medical schools.

* Premed prerequisites
* Graduation requirements
* Extracurriculars (research, volunteering, clinical experience)
* MCAT studying and test-taking
* Letters of recommendation
* Application compiling, editing, and waiting

Regardless of what you major in, you need to do the following: Earn a strong general GPA. Do well in all your pre-med required courses. Do well on the MCAT. Get good, meaningful recommendations. These don't have to be from scientists, but they do need to be from academics or professionals who know you well. The best recommendation comes from a professor with whom you have worked closely for more than just a summer. Your work with the professor has to be consistent and of high quality in whichever field you are working.

A Discussion on the Direction of this Subreddit.,insanemo,33,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/pla1t/a_few_observations_and_notes_on_premed_culture_a/,"For those of you that don't know, I'm the moderator for /r/premed. A few years ago I started a blog called [Pre-Med Hell](http://www.premedhell.com/) and after it became moderately successful I started this subreddit.

When I started the blog I had one simple mission/goal to change the premed culture. I no longer wanted the word premed to be synonymous with gunners and to be part of a group of students that is almost [universally reviled](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/top-5-reasons-t/). I wanted to form friendships and foster a culture of caring and helpfulness not one of stepping over people to get to the top at any cost. 

I know I'm not the most active commentator on this subreddit; but rest assured I read everything and chime in on occasion. I've begun to notice people being discouraging and down right disrespectful to others. That's not how I want to see my fellow students behaving and definitely future physicians behaving.

Because of this I'm instituting a few simple rules and a very simple system to enforce these rules.

1. **Rule #1:** Don't be an asshole. If you need to ask if your post makes you come off as an asshole simply don't post it. There is a strict 3 strikes policy on this. No exceptions.

2. **Rule #2:** Follow rule #1.

3. **Rule #3:** If you don't know the answer to the question or are unsure of your answer you must preface it with that fact. We don't need people handing out bad advice. Source your responses. I will warn people about this; but hopefully this will not become a major issue.

4. **Rule #4:** Try to contribute to the discussion and keep this place civil. 



I'm really hoping I won't have to enforce these very much because most of you know this to be common sense. But I will not hesitate to enforce these rules. Lets all work together to make the premed community a great and welcoming place to be. There are other places you can go on the internet if you wish to be ridiculed, mocked, and/or wish you behave like an asshole. This is not one of those places and I will do my best to keep it this way.

**tl;dr:**Don't be an asshole and we won't have any problems. Kapeesh.

The question of when to submit apps vs. when to take the MCAT has come up a bunch in the last couple weeks as June approaches and mayhem soon ensues. Since the answer gets repetitive, here's a summary.

Generally, submitting your application sooner than later is better-especially for all the reapplicants out there. It takes AMCAS (and AACOMAS for that matter) less time early in the season to verify your app than later, with the longest times usually being in August and September. I can't speak to the Texas system. When I submitted in August, it took 3 weeks to verify. When I submitted in June, it took 10 days. Also, rolling applications will give preference to early applicants just because more seats are available.

Your application *can be* verified [without your MCAT scores](https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/amcas/faqs/171618/can_i_submit_my_amcas_application_without_my_mcat_scores.html). Same for LORs btw. What happens from there is, from my experience, school dependent:

* Some schools, the second you press submit, will send you secondary apps (Hopkins and Columbia come to mind).

* Some schools will wait for your app to be verified before sending secondary apps.

* Some schools (not many) will wait for your primary to be verified and complete, including MCATs and LORs, before sending secondaries. These schools screen applicants by GPA/MCAT because they get so fricken many applications (some big state schools).

* Some, very few, schools don't have secondaries and will need your complete primary application before moving on (Mayo f.e.). 

Your MCAT scores are sent to every school to which you applied the minute you receive them. So if you submit your app in June, take the MCAT in mid June, your application will have your scores in mid-July. The delay that can be problematic is schools decide who to interview or not based on a **complete** application: completed primary with current/up-to-date MCATs and LORs and completed secondaries. Schools generally begin interviewing in mid-September early October and keep going until March-ish. You want to be verified and complete on the front end of that time-line because every step comes with a 3-6 week delay. 

Finally, if you submit your application without MCATs of LOR, when those items get attached, contact the schools and tell them so they can note that the update has been made or can be expected. Delays can and do happen because things like this get lost in the kerfuffle. ",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,True,t3_1ex0iv,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1ex0iv/psa_mcat_and_app_timing/,

I think he might be right.,snakebite_repair_kit,33,5,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1d7e8n/today_a_doctor_in_my_er_told_me_id_never_get_into/,"I'm a post-bacc student retaking a few classes while working 2 jobs -- one as an ER technician and one as a student EMT. 

I completely wrote off med school as an undergrad and took a ton of pre-med/math/upper-level science classes just because I like science and wanted to learn as much as possible -- plus, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life so I didn't see any reason to limit myself. I thought grades didn't matter as much as exposure to the subject did, assuming that whatever research-related career I'd find, they'd care more about me and my interests than my GPA. Which was a 3.2. Could be worse, I thought.

During senior year I had sort of late-college crisis and realized I hated research. I knew I had to enter the ""real world"" soon and thought about what sort of job I could get doing science that wasn't research. I thought, why not medicine? I took all the prereqs because I wanted to learn it all, so I signed up for the MCAT and started studying.

It was about then I did my first and most basic research into medical school. I found out my GPA was abysmally low. I didn't research much further because part of me knew I would just be told to forget about it. Instead I studied for the MCAT. If I did poorly on it, I thought, THEN I'd forget about it -- but if I did well, maybe I still had a chance.


I got a 34Q. I had studied hard and I was proud. I moved back home and decided to formulate a plan to build a successful applicant profile. I became a little bit addicted to calculating and recalculating my AMCAS and AACOMAS stats/lurking on SDN trying to figure out whether it was worth it to even try. I got my EMT-B license, volunteered at a hospital, and eventually transitioned to a paid ER technician job once I got certified. I got an A in my EMT course and started on my grade-repair phase with a biochem class last semester, in which (with a lot of effort) I'm earning a solid A. This is key, because my science GPA is 2.9-3.0 (depending on the spreadsheet version I use) and cGPA is 3.1 (will be 3.2 after this semester). I know. It's bad.

My EMT class was when I first got excited about emergency medicine. I knew every chapter front and back, and still wanted to learn more. I started teaching myself to read 12-lead EKGs, memorizing first-line and second-line code drug indications/contraindications/doses/what have you, triage algorithms -- stuff like that. I've never been so enthusiastic about anything before, so I thought hell, maybe this medicine thing is the right choice after all.


I started my first class of grade-repair last semester at UIC, while continuing my ER technician job. I have since completely fallen in love with emergency medicine. I know that sounds weird but I can't get enough of it. There are a ton of podcasts aimed at ER physicians -- EMCrit, ERCast, Best Case Ever, Annals of Emergency Medicine -- plus more online resources than you'd believe that give access to lectures and talks aimed at ER physicians. I love my job, and I'm good at it. The doctor makes the important decisions, but I'm the one who has to explain to the terrified woman on BiPAP why we have to put defibrillator pads on her chest just for the transport to the ICU, and I'm the one who looks the elderly patients in the eye and gets to treat them like a human being deserving of respect even after I change their shit-filled diaper. Yea it sounds gross but it's rewarding, and I feel like I'm doing some good in these people's lives.

Anyway, I also just got a job as an EMTB for my 'post-bacc' university's EMS squad. I'm planning on applying to MD and DO schools this cycle, if nothing else because when I reapply next year it'll show some commitment. I've spent unhealthy amounts of time reading medical school essay books, calculating GPAs and Lizzy scores and reading AACOMAS/AMCAS applicant materials, stuff like that. Lately I had been getting confident -- I've gotten my recommenders chosen, my essay is awesome, and I have a plan. I know it might not happen this year, but I was optimistic.


Then today in the break room one of the ER docs was (unusual for them to be there at all) was hanging out talking to one of the nurses. They were talking about med schools and I said something about how impossible it seems to get into the top ones for even the most perfect-sounding applicants. He was saying yeah, it really is hard these days, you need a really high GPA. I said well, mine's only a 3.1 and he threw his arms back and said 'Forget about it.' Didn't even let me finish the sentence. He's a pretty blunt guy and he couldn't have possibly known how deep that cut hearing it from one of the people I spend all day watching, knowing they're living my dream -- but it felt like getting kicked in the stomach. I said 'well, I'm applying anyway, I'll have a 4.0 post-bacc and my MCAT was really good...' and he interrupted 'no, no, GPA is all. the other stuff matters but no one gets in with that GPA.' what probably hurt the most was that he was right.


Anyway, it has sent me into a kind of crisis and I don't know who to turn to for advice. I'm retaking classes because AACOMAS lets you do grade replacement, whereas if I were just applying to AMCAS I could at least take new courses and maybe work towards a masters. $3,000 a semester for one class, and I'm paying out of pocket. I'm stuck living with my parents, so I don't have to pay rent or for food, but my life is devoted to this goal pretty much. I realized I could be wasting a huge amount of time and effort. I know SMP's exist but I don't have the money for full tuition (without working)  and was hoping I'd get just barely competitive enough with a few retakes/semester and awesome ECs/essay/LORs. Was that a pipe dream? Am I just wasting my time, my money, my social life, and my energy for nothing? 


Before today I was thinking it was possible. Now I'm wondering if I made a huge mistake. I'd be really grateful for any perspective from an outsider. Sorry that was so long but I had a lot to get out.

1353782438.0,25,self.premed,13q0wg,I see a few people here that are worried about their GPA and MCAT scores. Here is a simple Excel spreadsheet that I made for evaluating my own scores.,methus0,32,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/13q0wg/i_see_a_few_people_here_that_are_worried_about/,"Hey all, I am a junior pre-med student with a 3.38 GPA and a 33 MCAT score. Like many other pre-med students, I tend to be lopsided in one of the two criteria medical schools use for admission. So, I was curious as to how my MCAT scores would offset my lowly GPA when I applied to medical school. All of these calculations could be done with a calculator but I made the excel to get a really quick analysis when I was comparing multiple medical schools.

[Here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6122001/Blog/Pre-Med%20GPA%20and%20MCAT%20score%20Calculations.xlsx) is the Excel Spreadsheet I made to evaluate my scores. 

[Here](https://www.aamc.org/download/161700/data/table21.pdf) is the source I use for obtaining information regarding a state's MCAT or GPA averages. For an individual medical school, I recommend going to their website.

It is a very simple analysis, really. The Excel's calculations rely on the assumption that you reduce/grow one variable, MCAT or GPA, to the schools mean/average and see the effects on the other. For instance if I had a 35 MCAT score and a 3.0 GPA and were applying to a school with a average MCAT of 30 and GPA of 3.5, then we could see how much my surplus MCAT could influence my lower GPA.

For the previous example we would first find the difference between my raw MCAT score and the schools mean score. Then we take that difference and divide by 45(the maximum possible amount possible to score on the MCAT). Taking that value we multiply it by 4(the maximum possible GPA that any student could hope for) and add it to my 3.0 GPA. If my modified GPA exceeds or meets the mean for the school, then it would appear that the MCAT score made up for my lowly GPA. This same method can also be used to determine how much a bad MCAT score can influence your effective GPA.

I posted this on a [blog](http://interimofinterest.blogspot.com/2012/11/pre-medical-requirements-and.html) a while back. I thought you all may be interested.

1355009405.0,28,self.premed,14ir1o,IAMA M1 who by the end of my sophomore year had a 3.4 GPA and barely any ECs. Got into top choice. AMA.,icelittle,37,9,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/14ir1o/iama_m1_who_by_the_end_of_my_sophomore_year_had_a/,"Hey all,
So I was wondering if I could help anyone out with the whole pre-med thing. I didn't have any help from counselors/advisors/whatever throughout the process, so I know how confusing it can be.

I am someone who did not really know I wanted to do medicine until my 2nd year. During my second year, I joined AMSA and dropped out by the end of the year b/c I can't typically stand pre-meds, hah. My science grades were also lackluster (solid B's for chem/physics), and I had no professors to get letters of rec from as I wasn't into the whole kissing ass thing.

So how did I manage going to one of my top choices for med school? I credit a lot to good fortune, but I did kick total ass starting the summer after 2nd year. I volunteered as a patient companion (and found my calling there, along with specific passions that would guide me through) and started helping in research in a very basic way (basically just data mining). I upped my class-load starting August of 3rd year with what amounted to a double-major with a thesis, and began working in two separate research labs (one bench and one more clinical). I moved on from AMSA to organizations that I actually liked. I took a month out lectures to be in the hospital all day (while catching up on class at night). And instead of just trying to impress professors, I formed real relationships with people who would eventually write me letters of recommendation without kissing ass. But probably most importantly, I started studying for the MCAT VERY early. I'm not a good test-taker, at all, so I literally studied the MCAT for a year, 6 months just a bit a day, 3 months pretty solid, and 3 months basically just dedicated to the MCAT. I rocked it with a 37 (which really isn't that great for someone who studied for a year).

By the time I was applying, I had 3 different research experiences under my belt, got my GPA up to a 3.5, a 37 MCAT, awesome letters of rec, decent clinical experience, plenty of research, and real specific passions for what drove me, things that I could talk to my interviewers about in a real way.

So yeah, the basic gist is, even if you are behind in this whole med school application thing, you can do it. Just put in the effort and, once interviews roll around, don't be a complete tool. I may be slow with answering questions and whanot, but at least through December, I would be happy to keep in contact with whoever to offer advice.",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,True,t3_14ir1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/14ir1o/iama_m1_who_by_the_end_of_my_sophomore_year_had_a/,

1. Current GPA? (cum/science/all other)    

2. Traditional or non-trad?

3. When do you want to take the MCAT/begin studying?

First, my stats:  3.29cGPA, 3.04sGPA, 32MCAT non-URM

1. There are a ton of factors that come into play when you are trying to stand out from the standard 3.7+/37+ stats.  For me, I think it was partially my story, ec's, and my interview that helped truly set me apart.

2. Definitely, my GPA is super low from most all Med Schools, but getting a 32 on my MCAT truly helped me get my foot in the door.  I went through a kind of identity crisis, which really hurt my grades over two semesters (1 C and 1 D), but I learned from these experiences, and more importantly, found myself extremely comfortable in pursuing my goal, because I knew it was **mine** to pursue.

3. University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, I am not a legacy.  In fact, I'm an out of state applicant, which I think could have helped me.

4.  Honestly, I don't have much good advice for anyone in my situation.  I think that I am extremely fortunate to have had my medical school application process play out the way it did, from getting a 32, to landing an interview.  Probably the #1 piece of advice I can give, is apply early.  You have a chance! %40 according to the statistics found on SDN.

This was the second time I've sat for the test and I did considerably worse this go round then I did on the first try. I'm now in quite the predicament...
I'm 30+ and walked away from a successful career at a younger age to pursue my dream of being an MD. Went back to school, grinded out awful jobs to pay the bills (barely) and really reached out for help from others (financially and otherwise) to help me achieve my dream. Yesterday reality bitch-smacked me in the face when I got my scores: I've now let down dozens of people over the past 4+years, I've wasted a massive amount of time that would've further advanced my previous career and all I have to show for it is more debt.
The time I spent leading up to this point was amazing: I enjoyed going back to school, I LOVED all of the shadowing I did and, egotistically, didn't mind one bit the looks on peoples faces when I told them I was going to be a doctor. I'm just not sure any of that matters anymore. As much as I want to be a doc, I also want to start a family and get married. I miss having health insurance and a padded bank account from a career I have instead of a meaningless job that provides me with no challenge. I feel at this point that it would be a waste of time and money to sit for the MCAT a 3rd time because I would already assume I would do horribly and be even further behind. 
Help me premeddit, you're my only hope. I don't need an SDN answer of ""You're stupid, you should be landscaping with that score."" I'm an educated person with a solid degree and experience that could get a cozy job by the end of the year. I could also try the MCAT again. What should I do?

On one hand: 
I've had many people tell me that it's better to go to a state school and get a high GPA to go to medical school. In middle school (I'm in college now), I was seeing a doctor for an issue and he, after hearing I wanted to be a doctor, told me to go to a state school and get close to a 4.0 and I'll be set. This seems to be the overwhelming majority opinion when I talk to the average layman. 

On the other hand:
I've had a few people tell me that it makes a big difference. An interviewer for the school I'm at (who was a physician) was on the admissions committee for a medical school for about 10 years before she decided to take a governmet job and she said that certain schools (including the one I was interviewing for) essential got a +0.5 gpa boost when applying. Another student at my school who will be at Vandy med this fall told me that school name made a big impact during interviews and that GPA from this school was weighted significantly because it was known as an exceptionally tough school. 

What does the consensus on this issue seem to be? Does it depend by school? Is there a ""list"" of schools that get a second look? Is there a scale? Does it not matter at all?

Where do I go from here?,shibbyboi182,18,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1gj3cr/letter_writer_passed_away_strange_scenario_that_i/,"My non-science letter writer was a close mentor in my non-medical pursuits. He was working on my letter several weeks ago, and sent me over a rough copy (I didn't ask for it, I guess he just wasn't clear on the waiving review and such). After a couple weeks of not hearing back from him (emails, calls, showing up at his office, he missed graduation which apparently was a first in 20 years), paired with the fact that he's an older gentleman, I started to put two and two and consider the possibility. It was confirmed a few days ago that he passed.


In addition to the sadness this has brought myself and others in our program, I'm now in a bind. 

My question is where do I go from here? I don't have many non-science possibilities, and he was likely my strongest letter writer. I contacted a backup professor, who doesn't remember me very well, and he's agreed to do it. But obviously it's not going to be a strong letter as he barely knows me. I'm scared it's going to hurt my application. I have the rough draft of the original professor's letter which is very good. Should I make an appointment with the Department head (who does not know me) or someone like that and ask them to cosign a finalized copy of my deceased professor's draft? I really don't know what to do.

I graduated high school May 29, 2012 but that last week my father was ill, with pneumonia and had severe dehydration. I took my finals early so I could spend all my time by his side. My father was release from the hospital on May 28 but unfortunately he missed my graduation because he couldn't handle being around so many people while he was still feeling ill. I remember what I said to him as if it was yesterday, ""Don't worry, dad. There will be more graduations to come and you can make those."" 

On June 3, 2012 I woke to my cell phone ringing. My brother was calling me telling me to go check on dad because he was acting funny. I almost rolled over and went back to sleep but I decided that I should go check on him. As I walked down the stairs to my father's room the house was dead silent. I turn the corner into my dad's bedroom and I see him lying there, motionlessness and near agonal breathes. I have all the certifications my young self could have so as I grabbed his hand to check for capillary refill and pulse.  My father was having a heart attack. Never would I thought I would acquire all these certifications and the first person I would have to use them on was my father.

I immediately grabbed an aspirin and had him chew on it. I had called the ambulance at this point and was keeping him awake the best I could. He had a seizure and the agonal breathing began. I knew that when it got to this stage chances were slim but I started CPR immediately.  I was reminding him that I didn't work my ass of to go Florida to get recognized for my career portfolio and him not go because his heart decided to be a bastard. 

I am skipping the more morbid details as it is still hard for me to cope with. At 12:01 my father was pronounced dead of an acute myocardial infarction caused by a pulmonary embolism. My father was my best friend and my hero.

Two weeks later I am sitting in Disneyland receiving my National Recognition Award and my father, my best friend, isn't there to hug me as I walk off stage. Is someone cutting onions in here? Shit.

I got rejected shortly after the interview. As in, I didn't even have to wait until the decision date, I was rejected upon review meaning I was lowest priority - i.e. bottom 10%, i.e. obvious red flag. 

I really can't think of anywhere I screwed up badly in particular other than the outfit. I rambled a bit, but definitely not excessively and my interviewer seemed to like me. Maybe he was just a nice guy. 

So my black jeans that looked like dress pants and button-down shirt obviously didn't cut it. I can't think of anywhere else I screwed up. A medical student at that school from SDN speculates lack of a suit is an automatic reject because it shows poor judgment and lack of professionalism. I'm devastated.

Fortunately, VCU is more open than the usual school when it comes to post-interview feedback, and I expect to get it on Monday. If there was something that stood out aside from my outfit, I'll post an update in this post.

Fortunately, the day after I felt my world was shattered, I got another interview at an amazing school that I never felt I had a chance at (my GPA is below their 10th percentile) but applied because I like it so much. The location is way more convenient for my fiancé's job prospects than VCU. In retrospect I'm happy that VCU was my practice round and have a better idea what not to do in the next interview. 

I am grateful to have been given this second chance at going to med school in the US. 

**UPDATE:** Asked for feedback, received the following: ""In future interviews please listen carefully to the questions giving very specific examples and less generalizations.""

Uh oh. No mention of my outfit and I didn't realize that was such a dealbreaker. I don't even think I did this - I gave concise examples of each of the qualities I mentioned and the points I made. I did ramble a bit though. I'll definitely make sure not to do it the next time. 

So my theory is this - my rejection wasn't based on the outfit alone, but my outfit kind of caused my other minor issues (i.e. nervous rambling) to become dealbreakers.

I did my undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering and applied to medical school the summer after my junior year. High GPA (3.92), good MCAT (33), some research, some volunteering, did a college sport all through undergrad. Got two interviews: one at my state school and one at Albert Einstein (in May!).  No wait list, got in nowhere.

I am now an MA student in Medical Humanities/Clinical Ethics. I was interested in doing this as an MD/MA as it was, so I went with the MA after not getting in. I also kept involved in research, more clinically focused though. I spent a few months shadowing an FM physician. Still did volunteering, not a hospital. Spent a lot of time in the hospital with Medical Ethics Consultations and Palliative Care consults. 

I applied both DO and MD. I interviewed at DMU, CCOM, KCOM, my state MD school, Harvard, and Mayo.

I feel like I am going insane from my classes. Every week I have an exam and I don't feel like I have the time to study sufficiently for them all. I keep getting B's and can't seem to break the B barrier even when I cram. I am taking Calculus, Biology, and OChem all at the same time so maybe that is part of the problem. 

One of the issues is I can't force myself to study enough, I have always been a slacker to some degree and I have worked hard to break myself of those habits. But after transferring to a University from a Community College some of these habits seem to have come back. I just see my friends all out having fun, partying, having relationships, having time to play video games, etc. and I am just sitting here studying and reading stuff on the internet trying to use my free time to relax. 

I guess my question is just how do you guys keep going? I just got a B on a Biology test that I probably could have spent another day or two studying for and that is what sparked this post (that and a minor breakdown).

With minimal connections in town, and no knowledge of the local doctors, it was daunting to cold call offices, but after only two hours of calling, I already have one doctor who has agreed to let me shadow, and more who say they will call back next week.

Here's my pro tip, type this into Google: 

""(Your college's name) medical* (the town you are in)""

I found a few alumni right away, it took a bit of digging around to find contact numbers, but even coming from a small school (3500 students), there were alumni doctors to be found. 

I called a few doctors in professions I'm interested in (orthopedic surgery, and osteopathic medicine), and the receptionists were all polite. Be sure to introduce yourself as a student right away, ""I'm blah blah, a junior at university of blah blah."" I forgot to do this at the first clinic I called, and the nurse on the other end of the line told me that I should make sure to introduce myself well if I call any more clinics (she was super nice).

I always told the nurses that I was new in town, didn't have any connections, and was calling just in case they might have something available. I think this strategy worked for me, as I got a call back two hours later from a doctor.

tl;dr: Cold calling can work, just use Google to your advantage, and be very polite with the receptionists.

I'm currently a student attending Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm enrolled in a class called User Interface Design where groups of students have to design a novel new application. My group's idea was to design a smartphone application to help students study for the MCAT.

The application automatically schedules study time for you throughout the week based off of your availability, and it uses your practice test scores to determine which subjects you need to focus the most on. The application is also dynamic, prompting users to take pop quizzes and more practice tests which change the study schedule based off of your new study needs.

For the initial stage of our group project, we have to do data collection as part of a design method. If you have previously taken the MCAT and have 10 minutes of free time, it would be awesome if you could take this survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nGs7WSeD_G1kYGWFT36t8ugzS6O-WYLHx2drPA9IvT4/edit

A great alternative for SDN!

I have been noticing the community growing faster and faster, and I like the initiative to create an FAQ. I also had a couple more ideas to make this community a bit ""better,"" and was wondering what your thoughts were, if you had any other ideas, etc. We could get the conversation going and the mod can decide what he/she wants to do with it.

1) Flairs. I know there are some actual medical school students, residents, and doctors in this subreddit that have been through the process that the premeds are trying to go through. I think it would be helpful to give them flairs so we can see who have been through the process and whatnot. To get the flair you would have to verify with the mods, and it could say something like M1, M2, or R1, Attending, Fellow, whatever your standing might be.

2) ""What are my chances"" thread. I know a lot of people want to get second opinions on their own stats, and I don't think it's to be frowned upon, but I do think these kinds of thread is kind of clogging the community. I think directing all of ""what are my chances"" questions to one thread (and put it in the sidebar) would give us more room to discuss general issues etc. Also, once this ""what are my chances"" thread accumulates enough posts/data, one can simply go to the thread and look for a similar stat and get a general sense of what their chances might be. I know the odds are different for every applicant, but since paranoid pre-meds (like myself) like looking stats up and trying to calm themselves down, I think this might be a good idea.

That's it! I definitely want to hear what the others think, and if you have any other ideas to improve this community you should put it up so we can have a discussion going, and hopefully the mod will take some of it into consideration.

1376601703.0,16,self.premed,1kg1jo,Some advice for those of you currently working on your secondary essays.,Altare21,17,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1kg1jo/some_advice_for_those_of_you_currently_working_on/,"Anyone else feeling burned out yet? I am. It's tough to grind out all of these secondary essays, and after a little while you start feeling the dreaded writer's block coming on. It's getting harder to write, and harder to write well. I feel like this stems from a desire to want to write the perfect essay right from the start, but I don't think that's the best way to do it. I'd like to share some advice that has worked for me so far--take it or leave it.

1. Break the prompt down into sections. What is it asking? This is the most important aspect of writing a good essay. You need to answer the prompt. Often times this comes in the form of  ""describe x experience and how you have grown from it."" There are two parts to this question that you need to address, which can be tricky to do in 150-200 or so words. This seems pretty intuitive, but it's important enough to highlight anyway. Be careful when copy/pasting essays from one secondary to another, as the prompts will almost always be slightly different and one essay might not *exactly* answer the the prompt on a different secondary.

2. You have the prompt split into sections. Now make bullet points under each question. For your ""x experience"", write down what it was, and details about what exactly you did. Move on to the other sections and make appropriate bullet points. How have you grown from it? Well you learned y, and z. Put those in bullet points.

3. Now comes the stream of consciousness. Look at your bullet points and expand them. Just start writing. The important part here is that what you write doesn't even have to make sense. Forget proper grammar and writing in complete sentences. Just write your ideas down while they are in your head, and make sure you write everything down in order so it seems like you have at least some rough idea of flow. 

4. Don't be surprised if you now have a chaotic 400 word jumble of an essay in front of you. That's how it should be. From here on out, it's time to edit. Pick out the important ideas, and rewrite the entire thing. This time, pay more attention to writing coherently and focus on those important ideas you highlighted. It doesn't need to be perfect, but pay more attention to grammar and spelling now, too.

5. Repeat step 4 until you've whittled down your essay to the desired length. Now it's time for polish, and here's where it gets tricky. Just remember that you've now already done the bulk of the work. There are obvious things you should focus on, like grammar and spelling, but don't forget about flow. Flow is critical for keeping your reader interested. Pay particular attention to transitions, as well as your first and last sentences. In the example above, the essay was broken up into 2 pieces. There should be a transition that links those two pieces in your essay, or else your essay will switch focus too abruptly. Your final sentence should tie everything together and reflect the overall theme of your essay.

6. Review time. Is your essay the correct length? Does it answer the prompt? Is the grammar/spelling/syntax as perfect as you can make it? Does it flow? If you've answered ""yes"" to each of these questions, then chances are you just wrote a good essay, regardless of the content, your particular style, or writing ability.

1. How hard are the MCAT test's in comparison to the Kaplan practice tests? So far I've done one practice test of off the AAMC website and I scored a 31. But on the Kaplan tests Ive scored constantly around 26-28. The ones that I am taking are old though because they still include the writing portion and they are much longer. 

2. I submitted my application already and I am just waiting on the results to come in for my MCAT this thursday. Would it be a wise idea to retake the exam as soon as mid july? You know, just to try and get a higher score and boost my chances. I dont want to waste money but it would be worth it if it pays off. Ive been studying (legitimately) for this exam for about a month now and I feel like I've got a good handle on it but I'm not perfect and I could get there in 3 weeks. My pre req courses helped a lot. 

3. This question is a little off topic but could someone please give me some insight as to how to keep a healthy relationship with your significant other while being in medical school? Basically, is it plausible to keep up the workload and hours while still dedicating time to a relationship.

So I just got off the phone with New York Medical College. I wanted to see how my late submission would impact my chances. The woman who responded was a very sweet lady who told me that people often have misconceptions about rolling admissions, and that my chances will not be harmed significantly if I submit in September. They said they are very careful to ensure fairness.

That being said, it is true that those who submit early have a higher chance of getting in. The woman told me that this is merely because that group is self-selective. The better candidates are normally more proactive. The candidates who are most sure about medical school, who have often spent years preparing to go, who are more ""on top of things"" are more likely to apply early and submit better quality applications. She said they receive more higher quality applications towards the beginning of the application cycle, that's just how it is. She reiterated that these people are more likely to get in due to the quality of their applications, rather than the fact that they submitted early.

If you want further clarification, you might want to call NYMC. They're very nice about answering questions.

EDIT: BUSM just gave me a similar answer.

**CLARIFICATION**: You can submit the AMCAS before you get our MCAT scores and LORs (let's say you're taking the Sept MCAT). If you submit in July, for example, before you get your MCATs and LORs, as long as you get your LORs by sometime in September, you'll be in the same point in the queue as you'd be if you submitted everything in July. That's because adcoms only start meeting around September, so they look at apps in order of AMCAS submission date usually, so the woman meant that I won't be penalized.... but you might be if you decide to wait until Sept. to submit the whole thing.

First, some basic demographics. I'm a 27 year old (nontrad) white male from the northeastern US.

During my first year of college, I was working at a lab on campus and stole some ethanol. RA found out. I got arrested for theft, lost housing, and was dismissed from my school. I also had a GPA of around 0.8 between both the semesters until I was kicked out. Yeah, there was quite a bit that went wrong that year.

I went to community college after and did marginally better but had a bunch of withdrawals. I messed around until I eventually just quit it and went to work. I somehow found work being a histotechnician and did the full-time thing there. I also was working on pursuing a career in music with my band at the same time. So that was my life: work and band.

I turned 24 and a bunch of crazy stuff happened that I won't go into detail, suffice to say that it made me get the wild idea that I should try to get into medical school and be a doctor. I wanted it since I was a kid, but that freshman year was a really challenge for me and I dealt with pretty good stigma and confidence issues after it was over with. The first thing I did was go back to my community college to retake some classes and get an associate's degree. Graduated there with a 3.5, after the grade replacement.

I immediately transferred into a 4 year state school. I had nothing going on my first year in the way of EC's, but my second year I picked things up hardcore. I took Orgo over the summer, doing lecture and lab morning and afternoon and going to EMT school in the evenings. I was acing everything. I started tutoring all sciences and volunteering as an EMT my second year. Tutoring helped me study for the MCAT. MCAT day came and I got a 35R.

When I graduated with my BS, I had a 3.9 and graduated summa cum laude. I also had some research experience. I also took some grad level courses at the same school. I chose to do a master's degree during this year, the ""glide"" year, also, so that went into my AMCAS app.

I had also won some scholarships and awards of course which took up a bit of space on AMCAS. But yes, we all know AMCAS doesn't do grade forgiveness. My GPA on AMCAS with all the schools averaged in was about 3.0. 

With the money available to me, I was only able to fully apply (primary + secondary) to 12 schools. I chose these all to be MD schools, a risk I knew I was taking, but I took it based on my MCAT score. None were Caribbean. I was going to ride out the interview season and see if I should apply to DO schools. I applied in July, as soon as schools were allowing secondaries.

The result was that I got an interview invite almost right away in August. I went to it in October and had my acceptance in November. It was an out of state school that  liked but wasn't my first choice. All other schools except one have thus far rejected me. No other interview invites.

Good to see that there is more to Reddit than cat pictures. heh
I would like to talk to other pre-med students and current medical students about my wife to get an idea about if I am doing the right things for her. A little background might help...

My wife is originally from Latin America but has been in the US as a permanent resident for ~7 years. Her family immigrated here due to the dangers of living in a community run by cartels and corrupt government officials as well as the high rate of kidnapping for ransom. She has been focused on going to medical school for a couple years now and has been accomplishing some really great things for her future application. I have already fulfilled my main career aspirations and have secured a great job in a lucrative field, so I have decided to dedicate every free moment I have towards helping my wife realize her dreams. I spend a great majority of my time researching schools, opportunities and strategies for her, as well as setting her up with all sorts of opportunities in the medical field for her to gain experience and fuel her passion for the industry.  I coach her every day with any knowledge I glean from my research, and really love to see her get closer and closer to reaching her full potential, something she would have never had a chance to do were it not for her immigration to the USA. 

While my wife excels in the sciences and exhibits a true and obvious passion for the industry I am concerned about her English language skills. More specifically, I am concerned about how she will perform on the Verbal Reasoning portion of the MCAT exam. She can speak very fluently, and does not have a problem expressing herself, but I fear her reading comprehension is not up to par, which is somewhat expected as she went through her K-12 years outside of the US. I am adamant in that I will not let this be the reason for her rejection to a school once she applies in the near future. Listed below are actions I have taken to help sharpen her reading comprehension:

Though I was pre-med for part of my undergrad, I had a bit of a paralysis of analysis happen near the end of college and ended up not applying to medical school. After school I was kind of lost and worked some food service jobs and did some sales and other odd jobs before founding a company last summer. 

January 2012 I took the MCAT and got a 33S. My GPAs from 2008 were 3.31 cumulative and 3.43 science. 

It's become obvious to me now that I *do* belong in medical school, but I'm not quite sure how to go about getting letter of recommendation. I didn't know many professors well, and the one that I *did* know well was the guy I did research under. My last major interaction with him before graduation was a screaming match about why I wasn't going to grad school. So now I don't really know what to do about getting letters of recommendation.

I can try writing up a summary of what I've been doing and my resume and send that to some of the professors I took classes under, but after so many years are passed, I can't imagine their letters would be too impressive. I can get glowing letter from my previous employers (several of which are respected professionals), but I don't know how to handle not having stellar letters of rec from professors.

I'd greatly appreciate any thoughts or pointers.

- Be polite, and respectful.  I don't have a lot of time as it is, so even the smallest bit of rudeness gets amplified.  No chewing gum, for example.  

- When interviewing you, I'm thinking, would I want to have you as a doctor?  Would you respect my privacy?  Could I trust you with my information?  Could I trust you to listen to my concerns?  Will you go out of your way to help me, even if it's inconvenient for you?

- Don't volunteer information that makes you look bad.  It's alright if it's in context of a question, but if you don't have to, then please don't.  It goes straight to the form, because then I'm just wondering why you are telling me this.

The thought of becoming a doctor has been presenting itself more and more the older I get. It started about 2 years ago when I was considering joining the Army and I had to pick an MOS. I figured I would take the medical route, then apply to a post-bacc after I got out to raise my horrendous undergrad GPA which involved only 2 science classes.

I am currently a cisco certified networking specialist and I love the networking world, but the medical bug has bitten me hard and I'm researching becoming a cardiologist. I saw a video of an angioplasty procedure and really feel like I'd love to do that.

A little about me: 26 (going on 27 this July), 2.59 Undergrad GPA, Work experience in Fortune 500 companies in sales, marketing, and mangement, Cisco IT Pro, Tutor, I am currently researching volunteering opportunities at my local hospitals to get my feet wet and see if this is truly for me.

I haven't even looked at what the MCAT is about but have done a lot of reading to know that the MCAT is going to be huge with an application like mine, as well as stellar LOR's, among other things.

If anyone has any tips or recommendation, they would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Community College is less prestigious, and less competitive, absolutely.  There is nobody that could argue otherwise.  However, at this college, this 'lesser' form of secondary education provided me an environment to thrive.  

I went to university right out of high school and did so incredibly poorly.  To not fault of the univeristy, I just wasn't prepared to commit to any particular discipline and ultimately lost focus of my studies.  But after I had begun performing poorly, I didn't feel like I had anybody behind me.  I was just another face is a sea of students that was seemingly endless.  I felt no support, I was away from family, the school just wanted tuition payments, it was not a recipe for success for me.

After sometime, I returned to Community College and it felt like home.  I loved my community, and I felt loved back.  I am graduating this quarter with an Associate of Science.  I am inspired to write this because I have just received and invitation to university that I have visited, fell in love with, and could not be more excited to attend.  All my efforts have been doubly rewarded because today I was just told that I was a Scholarship recipient of $5,000 dollars renewable for up to 5 years.  

What I am trying to say it does not matter the name of the school as you drive in every day.  All that matters is that you give it your very best every single day, you will perform highly wherever you feel most comfortable.  Most loved.

So I got an update from VCU - apparently nobody cared about my outfit (or at least, they didn't mention it in the feedback) but I had answered the questions all wrong, or at least, not what they expected (and they want what they expected).

I think this might be a nice way of saying I rambled, but I don't know.

1) What do you do when you're in a group and someone isn't pulling their own weight?
My answer: First I would ask them nicely to start working and tell them how it's unfair that I have to do all the work. If they don't comply, tell them I will consult the superior if they continue slacking. Then I tell the superior, and we arrange it so that if they don't work, they don't get credit. However it tends to help the situation if I give the person a specific task, because often people don't pull their weight because they don't know where to start as they are daunted by the task. Therefore, it is easier if I tell them ""how about you do the introduction?"" instead of ""you should pull your own weight"" - it's more specific and gives them a distinct start and end point.

2) How do you take criticism?
My Answer: I love getting criticism, it's the only way I could grow as a person. I understand that I am a work-in-progress, and I appreciate any feedback I can get because it's actually quite rare. 

3) What do you do when you're in a group and nobody agrees with your idea?
Since it's a team effort, I understand that I am not the only person in the team so I am perfectly okay with ceding responsibility to someone who is more experienced than me in that regard. I would ask the group: ""Does anyone have any other ideas?"" to see if anyone could top my suggestion. Since it's a democratic effort, if the majority votes against me, the majority wins unless I have serious ethical qualms about it. 

I feel like question 1 was the hardest because every time I've been in that situation, after some encouragement, I just did all the work for them - those people who slack tend to be less talented than the more conscientious members anyway and the job ends up being done better if the brighter, more conscientious group members pick up the slack. So I have no idea what the ""appropriate"" answer is. ",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,True,t3_15it8c,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/15it8c/how_do_you_answer_these_interview_questions/,

So I am 6 days away from my MCAT day. 16th, 1:00pm. Oh boy!

I am a rising junior so this is very early for me. But I will not have time to take it next spring, so if I do have to retake it it would be in like June next year.

So I am really hoping this goes well. My worst fear is that I do okay (30-31) and have to really buckle down to make a re-take worth it. I have found a common trend that a re-take of the MCAT is only worth it if you can improve by 4 or more points.

In my last 3 practice tests I have gotten 36, 33, 34. 

I am averaging a 13-15 verbal, 9-11 Physical, and a 8-10 Bio. 

So with these last 6 weeks my plan was to take 2 more practice tests tomorrow and tuesday, and go over each of them. I really have no idea what to do outside of this. There is no specific material I have found that I am really lacking on consistently. I used to have trouble with spectroscopy, but recently got it down nicely.

How do post bacs work?,calion009,14,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/14smvc/what_are_my_options_how_do_post_bacs_work/,"So, I am graduating from a community college with a 2.5 GPA. I only went to a community college to save money, by the way. I had a lot of family problems, medical problems, and generally a hard time for ONE semester, failed all the classes that semester. That's why the GPA is low. I've been trying to get all my stuff in order recently because I'm transferring to a 4 year university soon. Since that bad semester, I've had nothing but As. 

So, I calculated stuff out, and it looks like I'd have to take close to 200 hours total (including the 60 I already have) making a 4.0 to raise my GPA to a 3.5.  Those aren't impossible odds, but I've seen better.

I don't need judgement here. I was 17 and got kicked out of my parents house during the semester I failed. I don't really want to go into details, but my dad has always been an alcoholic, and things got pretty bad at that point. Things have obviously improved since, but I still feel stuck. 

My school has a limit on how many repeats you can take, so I don't think that will really get me out of this. I am in contact with records to see if I could possibly have that one semester taken off my record for extenuating circumstances.

If that fails, what should I do? I've been looking into post bac programs. How do those work? Does the med school then ignore your undergrad GPA, or is there some kind of agreed matriculation if you pass, or what? I am trying to take this one day at a time. I just want to know if ever becoming a doctor is impossible because of one 3 month period when I was 17 years old.

Also, will med schools look at my new school GPA, or the combined for both schools more carefully? I assume both.

I went through the same stressful process last year and vividly remember the whole interview trail.  As a Texas resident, I only applied to TX schools and in total received 5 interviews.  One thing I decided upon was to record all of my interviews, then later go in and listen to how I conducted myself throughout each. I would just hit record prior to me entering the room and slip my iPhone into my suit jacket's interior pocket (be sure to put your phone into airplane mode).

I personally benefited from listening to my responses to questions.  I was able to hear how fast/slow I was speaking, or even how I phrased my response to a certain question.  Doing so allowed me to adjust my answers accordingly and I noticeably got better at interviewing as the process went on.

I just wanted to pass this little nugget of info along. Hope it helps someone.  Feel free to ask me any questions. I will be starting my medical journey in two weeks and have quite a bit of down time right now.

I'm on track to be able to have a good application my junior year, but something about taking some time off is just lingering in my thoughts.

Idk, it's too hard for me to think about. Especially because I'm getting somewhat competitive now, and probably gaining more chance of getting into my #1 choice even if I applied as a junior.

Every year, students ramp up to take the MCAT. You schedule your MCAT test date just prior to the beginning of the application cycle, and you study really hard as that fateful day approaches. You take a bunch of practice tests, and -- happy times! -- you see your score steadily improve.

About a week to 10 days before your test date, you take a practice test, and crashboom!, your score drops below what you had gotten just a few days ago. Now the shit hits the fan: Your actual MCAT test date is just a few days away, and you feel like, suddenly, you're in big trouble. You're frightened, worried, frustrated. You feel like you're screwed, and you start to reconsider everything, which sounds like this:

""Should I reschedule the test date for later?""
""Won't that delay my application?""
""Which means I probably won't get in this year … oh crap!""
""Which means I'll have to wait TWO MORE YEARS to just even START medical school. Oh, king size sheet!""
""Which means my life is basically over.""
""God … I feel fat.""

That's an example of MCAT panic.

But, in my experience, there's something else going on. You may NOT need to reschedule your test, you won't have to delay your application, you probably still have an excellent chance of getting in to medical school.

You're not fat.

**The Cause of MCAT Panic**
There's another reason why your MCAT practice test score might have dropped. It's not because you suddenly lost your ability to answer test question; it's not because you have had a micro-stroke and thereby lost your subtle cognitive skills. It's much more likely that you 1) had some very good improvement in your ability which was reflected in an improving trend in your MCAT practice test results, and then 2) you felt a degree of increasing confidence about your ability to take the MCAT, and then 3) you took a practice test with a subconscious belief, ""I've got this bitch nailed."" (Sorries to all dem bitches outdere. All respect.)

When you sit for that one last, or next-to-last, practice test with this viewpoint, you may have set yourself up. You got a little too confident, a little too cocky, and maybe, just maybe, you got a little sloppy. It doesn't take much, and your score results dip a bit and now you're off into this hellua-spiral-god-my-life-is-over-I'm-never-gonna-get-in.

As my friend Terri says, ""Not buyin' it."" Nope. I urge you not to believe your own hype, and instead take a good, hard look at your results. I'll bet you a nickel you'll find a few questions - maybe more than just a few - where you were a bit sloppy / hasty / cavalier. 

So instead of freaking out, rescheduling your MCAT, take a breath and ask yourself if you underestimated that-bitch-the-MCAT, or not.

**Background:** I'm a senior majoring in chemical engineering and decided to pursue medical school at the beginning of junior year (did a biomed co-op that exposed me to the medical field and sparked my interest) and I'm planning on applying this upcoming cycle.

Anyways by the time I confirmed that I really wanted to pursue medicine and got some research, shadowing and clinical volunteering under my belt, it was summer of 2012 (between junior and senior year) and the MCAT was the last hurdle left.

I signed up to take it Sept 2012 and started studying mid June. I took a diagnostic (AAMC #3) when I started and scored a 21. Unfortunately, coming from an engineering background, I had to teach myself a lot of the biology content and ochem since I forgot most of it. Content review took longer than I expected and I was not ready for the Sept. test at all so I postponed it to January 23, 2013. 

I promised myself to try and study regularly during fall semester but that was difficult to do with a full course load in engineering. In a flash, the semester was over and I had done minimal practice. I took another full length at the beginning of December and scored a 23. I decided to sign up with Kaplan's winter break 4-5 week course. I felt like I needed to follow a rigorous schedule to get me back on track. Following Kaplan's schedule, a week before my scheduled MCAT, I took another full length and scored a 26. 

Once again, I decided to postpone the MCAT to April 4th. I cut my course load for the semester in half so I could really focus on the MCAT - I was determined to get a 30+ in April. This whole semester, I've been studying for the MCAT everyday and utilizing a variety of study material: Kaplan's online material (Qbank, section tests, etc..), EK 1001 and 101 verbal, BR passages, TPR Hyperlearning questions, Khan academy,  and mcat-review.

I've tried everything, yet I'm still scoring below a 30. My latest full length was today and I scored a 27. My MCAT test date is in 2 weeks and I'm starting to freak out. I really don't know what to do anymore. This test has beaten me to the ground and shattered all my confidence.  After each full length, I completely lose all my motivation and want to throw in the towel. 

I've got a stellar application otherwise. Really good LORs, unique experiences and EC's, OK GPA (3.5 cGPA and 3.7sGPA), research, shadowing, clinical and non-clinical volunteering, co-ops and internships, etc... The only thing standing in my way is the MCAT.

I'm essentially leaning towards two schools on opposite coasts: UC Davis SOM and Boston University SOM. My question is this:

How important (if at all) is the school's geographic location in determining residency placement? Do residencies on the west coast prefer / lean towards admitting west coast students given two equal applicants? Do they not care?

I've heard conflicting answers - all things being equal, some higher ranked programs will lean towards students in the area rather than risk giving a slot to someone on the opposite coast (reason being that a local applicant is possibly more likely to accept an offer and the percentage of students accepting a program's offer off the bat is a factor in the perception of a program's overall competitive ranking).

The other answer is a concise ""doesn't matter.""

Also, for bonus points - what school would you prefer to go to and why? If you were totally split evenly between two schools...how did you finally come up with a decision?

Very low GPA and even worse…",nkzv,17,9,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1guf8j/ok_guys_im_in_the_worst_situation_possible_for_a/,"I was suspended from my university this past semester one week before I was slated to graduate. I was charged with academic dishonesty, namely plagiarism, due to ONE passage on a final paper that I didn't include in-text citations for. In no way did I intend to deceive my instructors or take credit for someone else's work. I was simply being careless while writing the paper and I majorly f***ed up and now I'm facing the consequences. Moreover, I failed that class that the paper was for and the class was a degree requirement, so I now won't be able to get my degree until Spring 2014 after I take the class again. 


It took me a month afterwards to get out of possibly the darkest place I have ever been. I was depressed throughout college but this recent event still has me reeling. But I'm now ready to get over it and look ahead as best as I can and I am still set on medicine, as I feel it is my calling and the only thing that will make me happy. I can go on and on about why I want to be a doctor but that's for a later time. 


I realize it will take a few years to do damage control and show medical schools that I've learned and matured, but I am so willing to try. I'm only ready to give up once I've applied a few times without success. So if anyone at all can offer some advice on how to recover and put my best foot forward, I would be forever grateful. 


Here's some further information you may need:
-cGPA: 2.75, sGPA: ~2.15 at a top 10 university (my GPA is abysmal because I refused the help I needed for my depression until it was far too late; I missed numerous classes and deadlines and really screwed myself over; I'm taking medication now and have noticed a significant change in my behavior and motivation and I am confident that I'll be able to perform really well in classes again)
-I haven't taken the MCAT yet but I'm starting a course this summer and will have a lot of time to devote to studying.
-I have 100+ hours shadowing a neurologist and a pediatrician
-I've volunteered in clinics both in the US and abroad
-I have at least three strong references and two good ones
-LOTS of research experience in various fields in neuroscience
-other average credentials that don't really make me stand out much


Here are my questions for you all:
-How do I bounce back from the suspension? I'm currently sitting at home struggling to find a job until I apply for readmission. Not having any luck so far.
-With regards to my GPA, I know I will need to either do a DIY post-bac, a more formal post-bad, or an SMP (if I'm able to get in) after I receive my degree. Is this a good idea? Is there anything else I can do to show adcoms I will be able to handle a rigorous courseload? Please keep in mind that I'm not trying to jump into classes immediately. I still need to work on my depression and motivation issues and I want to work for this next year to show that I'm mature and responsible.


Please don't post and tell me that I'm wasting my time and that I'm a failure and have no chance. I've heard it all from my parents, professors, and dean. Frankly, I'm terrified. I have no idea what my future holds for me and what steps I need to take to get out of this mess. All is know is that I am willing to put in as much time and effort as possible to make my dream a reality.

An occasional lurker of this subreddit coming to you guys with my current situation because I'm not sure who else to ask (my premed advisor's appointments are booked through the end of this week).  As a senior graduating at the end of next month, I am very *very* lucky to have secured two job offers and I am a finalist for the Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship (not the research grant).  Now, my decision for the job offers is due at the end of the week and I have no idea what to choose.

**Background**

- Asian female... does this matter?  I don't know.

- good MCAT (36)

- good GPA studying hard science at a top 20 uni (4.0 in the past two years, but 3.7 overall)

- good ECs (shadowing, meaningful clinical volunteering for two organizations)

- good research (basic science: 2 years, senior thesis and two posters, no pubs but acknowledged in a paper; clinical: .5 year research internship at hospital for clinical trial pt enrollment, other: abstract and manuscript author and poster presenter for a free clinic's innovative model of blahblahblah)

- unsure about LORs at the moment - nervous about this.

- not really distinguished in my hobbies (no awards in music, dance, writing, etc.)

**Job offers:**

- *(50-75% chance of receiving) Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship in Southeast Asia*

I am scared about this because I will have a lot of responsibility (to independently teach multiple(!) English classes) and I know international flights are pretty expensive during med school interviews.  Seems like it would be fun, and man - I would love to say that I was a Fulbright scholar.

- *National Institutes of Health Postbacc IRTA (full-time, stipend)*

I don't know how I landed this job because it requires Matlab (I have *basic* experience), I don't like coding, and I don't know anything about radiology.  But they liked me.  The stipend is modest ($29k) to live in Wash DC, but... other than the programming-all-day part, I don't see any glaring problems and the previous IRTA said research mentorship was excellent at this lab!

- *top 5 academic med center lab tech (50% paid position -- what does this even mean?)*

Research topic is interesting to me and directly related to my undergrad research.  Responsibilities in basic science *and* clinical settings, which is great!  i will be in the same coast/state as my family for the first time in 4 years, and I would really love to work in this location because it will look good for my in-state medical school interviews.  But... I'm trying to pay off my undergrad loans here...  I might have to pick up a side job?  Is it worth it?

**My only real goals for my year off are to:**

- ~~pay off my undergrad loans (a couple thousand)~~ just paid them off today!!!! yay!

- learn Spanish well enough to use it medically (optional but a serious goal!)

- hopefully get accepted to my in-state medical school (California)",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,1366743710.0,,,True,t3_1cx6fc,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1cx6fc/postuniversitygraduation_career_advice/,

I've applied to 24 MD schools, plenty from every ""tier"". I submitted my AMCAS application early and submitted most of my secondaries throughout August (added 5 schools in September). I have a 3.6 - 3.7 cGPA/sGPA and scored a balanced 32 on the MCAT. Double-majored in a hard science and social science at a well-known and regarded school. 

I've been out of school for almost three years now. I've mostly been working full time doing clinical research. I have a lot of volunteer experience, interesting/weird (in a good way) ECs, community service jobs throughout college, a few posters, and a *lot* of clinical experience (more than two years full time).

Anyway, I've gotten 3 interview invites and been rejected from 7 schools so far. I think that's a pretty good ratio. I was *extremely* happy about the interviews, especially the first -- it was at a brand new school in my home state that seems like a great fit for me. I had three individual interviews and I thought they all went really well. 

I had my second interview a week and a half after the first, at a more selective school in another state. I thought it went okay, but not quite as well as my first. 

Two days later -- two weeks after my interview -- I was flat-out rejected from the first school, where I thought I interviewed and fit so well. Not even waitlisted. I asked if they could give me a reason (politely, of course), and they said they couldn't tell me anything until after May 15th. 

Now I'm having a sort of crisis. If the first interview went badly enough to warrant an immediate rejection, I have absolutely no faith I'll get an acceptance after my second -- the school is more selective, and I thought it didn't go as well as the first. 

Most of all, I'm unsure of and have lost a lot of confidence in myself. My third interview is at my favorite school of the three. I should be ecstatic. They get an unbelievable number of applications, interview very few, and accept around half of those they interview. I'm truly lucky to be afforded the opportunity. 

But I'm psyched out and don't feel like myself. I feel like I have to fix something but I don't know what or how to go about doing it. 


**TL;DR: 3 interviews: shocked by straight-up rejection after what I thought was a good first interview, now anticipating rejection from the second, and bugging out about how I'm going to do at the third (and probably final)**

Edit: Thanks for the encouragement, y'all -- it gave me perspective. I'm going to hope for the best from my second interview and think of the first as a learning experience; it was, after all, my first medical school interview ever. I have a better idea of what I'm getting into and how to prepare myself now. ",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,1356020562.0,,,True,t3_154q14,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/154q14/panicking/,

I have had my ass handed to me by the chemistry and organic chemistry classes offered at my university and I don’t know what I should do.

* Masters degree in public health: for those who want to enhance their applications but don't want it to be in a science field.

* Masters degree in a life science/biomedical field: for those who want to enhance their applications, but also want an element of more research experience.

* informal post bacc's: I'm guessing its another way to provide graduated nonscience majors with a chance at completing their prereqs? How about grade enhancement; could you apply to schools after undergrad just so you could retake and better your BCPM grades?

* assuming you had a 3.5+ gpa and ~30 mcat (often considered the low end for a competitive applicant), but decided to do a gap year before applying, would working in a lab/hospital/international organization be beneficial?

I have decided that I want to pursue medicine as a career. However, after changing my major twice in my undergrad my overall GPA is not competitive for medical school. I have not taken the MCAT yet.
I was recently accepted into a PhD program in human physiology that is fully funded, with a stipend and a bonus. They offered me a very, very good deal. I also have the option of enrolling into the master's program at the same university (its a top 10 state school), but I would end up about 100K in debt after two years of tuition and living expenses. I also was accepted into a one year post-bacc program at an osteopathic school, but it is just a post bacc and not a masters. 50% of the students from the post bacc go on to enter professional schools, with ""a large percentage"" going to DO schools (from their website).

I wanted to hear some input from you guys and girls. The PhD program is VERY interesting aside from being fully funded. I also am not opposed to having to pursue medical school a little later in life (I would be 29 when I finish the PhD) because of the experience and everything else I would get with it.

So basically my choices are between those three, and I am leaning towards the PhD because I simply do not think it would be worth the risk and debt of a shorter program. Especially because I graduated with a 3.1 GPA, so I am not sure how much a one year program would benefit me.

Any advice?,FutureFlyDoc,10,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1hbne5/6_weeks_out_from_test_day_and_scored_a_29_kind_of/,"EDIT: Thanks for the comments guys. The general consensus seems to be to just focus on practice tests. Today I went through my whole test question by question. Whether I got it right or wrong I thought about how I came to my answers, and tried to take notes on broad ideas/strategies

Taking the MCAT in 6 weeks. My most recent practice test was a 29. My GPA is not good (3.6ish) so I need to hit a bit higher to be in a good place come application time.

I am a rising junior, so I am taking it very early. But I will be out of the country in the spring, plus I figured that studying in the summer would be better than during the school year, even though I have a job.

My scores were PS-8 VR-12 BS-9.

My VR is good. A friend pointed out that you can't really study for that in a matter of weeks. And I figure that it wouldn't really be worth it to try to raise that score since it will really come down to just a few points/lucky questions at that point. 

But my PS and BS definitely could improve.

I am finding that the Chem in the PS section and the Orgo in the BS section are my weakest. But for the most part I can't find anything specific.

When it comes to a specific passage I don't have any hit-or-misses. I usually get 5/6 or 6/8 of the questions right. It is just the one or two other questions that are adding up. I also do pretty good in the non-passage questions.

So I got six weeks, and I realistically want to get a 33, but 35 was my original goal. 

For now I am focusing on switching from doing a lot of reading to doing a lot of practice tests. This was my 3rd practice test kind of. I did one all the way through and got a 26. I did a 2nd one, but I split the sections up one day at a time. So I did the PS, then went over it. Did BS the next day, went over it, etc.

This latest was my 3rd test, and second time doing a full sit-down at the test. 

Sorry this is kind of vague. But I know all of the juniors/rising seniors likely just finished their MCATs and could maybe offer advice.

Here's my story:  I just graduated from law school about a year ago without much success so far in the job market.  I'm stuck at a dead-end, low-paying job that I more or less hate.  For the last few years I've been thinking that maybe I should go back to school to get my med school pre-reqs (while working).  And this isn't totally unprecedented because I started college with the intention of going to med school, but I bombed my first year and ended up changing majors.  So, I'm wondering two things:

(1) What are my chances of getting into a top-20 med school?  I'm confident that I'll do well in my post-bac classes, which will bring up my ugpa from a 3.0 (where it is now).  Also, I'm actually an MCAT instructor for a major test prep company so I'm pretty sure my score will be very good.  Lastly, I did very well in law school (top 15%), so I'm sure that can only help me.

(2) Am I being an idiot?  I'm not really in a good place right now as far as career goes, so I'm worried that I might just be taking - what appears to be - the easy way out (I'm not saying med school is easy).  On the other hand, being a doctor was my first choice when I started undergrad, so I'm this isn't completely out of left field.

I'm a college freshman debating whether to go premed.  I know it's a very difficult, all-or-nothing commitment (specific courses, specific ECs, et cetera) and was hoping to hear some perspectives to help inform my decision.

The physicians I've talked to and the internet searching I've done paints this picture of ""go into medicine only if it's what you've always wanted to do,"" whereas for me I'm thinking along the lines of 'I like science, I like helping people, I like learning, I like the idea of having a relatively secure career, I like the idea of not working at a desk' (as opposed to say academia which for what I'm good at seems to be all the toil of getting an MD with no light at the end of the tunnel).

On top of that, my physician told me the other day that she got an undergraduate GPA good enough for med school via ""studying the night before exams,"" which makes me think I'm not intelligent enough to do this (31 composite ACT score, currently a student at Tulane University - which is currently ranked at #51 nationally).

On top of **that,** my friends are liberal arts majors going 'whoah dude why spend your twenties toiling away?', I wouldn't finish premed requirements until the end of senior year, and I think my GPA this semester will be somewhere between a 2.5 and a 3.0 (didn't apply myself at all, only recently found a decent friend group due to social difficulty of not drinking or partying in a very ""bro""-y dorm, plus standard 'adjusting to college' stuff.).

All of this is making me question whether this whole thing is a pipe dream.

For a little background, I am a 28 year old male living in Washington, with a degree on what amount to political science.  Up until very recently,  I was on the well worn path to law school.  However, I had serious misgivings about the nature of the legal market and the hideous amount of debt that it would take to receive a JD.  So, I made the rational choice, and decided that I wanted to become a DO after a conversation with my father (who is a gastroenterologist). 
As far as my background in medicine, I was a medic in Afghanistan, where I worked in an aid station every day for a year.  I learned quite a lot, and enjoyed the everyday rhythm of seeing patients and caring for people.  When I got back, I was impatient and didn't  want to invest the time in doing all of the prerequisites for medical school, as i had already completed two years of college.  I just wanted to finish out my bachelors.  However, a bachelors in fine arts gets you into retail and little else.
What I would like input into is this;
1.  I have to work full time, and I don't think I could realistically manage volunteering at a clinic or something similar while taking two courses concurrently.  Will my military  experience negate the need for volunteering?
2.  I will likely have to take half of my courses online, due to the way my company schedules it's workers.  Has anyone used the online courses offered by the DO school in Maine, or those offered by OSU?

Turns out, I need to take Organic Chem I and II, Organic Lab I and II, Analytical Chem, Analytical Chem Lab, Biology I and II, Biology Lab I and II.  Whoa.  Then I need to also start clinical volunteering (you know, to make sure I actually want to be a doctor).  And working full time as a software developer (I work in the medical imaging field).  

Not gonna lie, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.  This is going to happen, but it's going to take a while before I'm even ready for the MCAT.  Anyone out there got advice, or stories of how they managed a similar situation?  Right now it's hard for me to believe than anyone goes through with this after they graduate!

I should add, since we love to hear people's stories here:  I've been involved in a good bit of biomedical research (two publications right now, two pending), Undergrad GPA of ~3.4 (AMCAS is definitely higher but it's hard to calculate because I transferred universities), volunteering mostly in the fields of tutoring physics, math, CS.",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,True,t3_1cxn9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1cxn9k/time_to_get_this_process_started/,

Should I write a letter to the in-state school I am waitlisted in or to my dream school? The total cost of attendance will be about 1/4th if I stay in-state.

I am writing this post today with the hopes of obtaining some more knowledge about the admission process for Canadian medical schools.
After completing High School I went to a local college and became a primary care paramedic, which is a 2 year course in Ontario. Upon completion I gained employment with an EMS service, but decided I wanted to go to medical school. In september I returned to university where I started a health science degree. I chose not to transfer any of my college credits because I knew I needed to be a full time student anyways. At this point I just want to make sure I give myself the best possible chance of getting into medical school.

I currently have a plethora of volunteer experience, ranging over the last 5 to 6 years. I work as a paramedic part time, while going to school full time. I am also 21 years old if that makes a difference.

If anyone could provide me with any information or advice regarding the admission process in Canada, with a focus on Ontario, it would be much appreciated. If you know of any resources out there that would be helpful please let me know.

1344718746.0,9,self.premed,y2a3v,"Hey guys, I'm not much of a writer, but I did some reflecting today. I don't have any questions on the entry into medical school, I just want to get to know my peers a little better. What experiences have further enhanced your desire to become a physician? I will start. ",imstillhereok,18,9,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/y2a3v/hey_guys_im_not_much_of_a_writer_but_i_did_some/,"Learning from an Infectious Disease specialist.

Okay, I’m not a great philosopher, so I have nothing to contribute from my young adult life that will inspire change just by listing off a vague representation of what I believe in. However, I know in my heart that the true power of change lies in the ability to relate to others through stories. I am not one to brag. I have so much potential, just like you do. Just like anyone does. But, what have I done with this conceptualized potential? Not too much. It’s time that I cash in potential energy into kinetic energy—as a physicist might say. the energy never goes away, but it’s how we convert it and put it to use. 

So here is a story that I love to reflect on. It has nothing really to do with me other than the fact that I am the passive observer, but the active listener as well. This is important. This is a true story. 

Last summer of July (so in 2011) I shadow a doctor. He is an infectious disease specialist. You can probably infer that I shadow this man because I aspire to be a physician one day. I meet him with a brief handshake and a smile. We immediately begin to walk—this is critical. We waste no time sitting down, something that a lot of people do in this age of an increasing sedentary lifestyle, including myself on most days.

He wastes no time to get to his first patient, and he never takes the elevator. He suggests we use the stairs to get exercise however we can, and this reminds me of how active we must be in our daily life. Every person he passes, he greets with a brief hello accompanied by a wonderful smile. He talks with me about who I am, what I like to do, and what my goals are for the immediate future. We see our first patient and he checks on his blackberry the blood cell counts of this sickly man. Here is a man with an extreme case of Pseudomonas. This is a disease that has stricken the man in such a way that most of his body’s vital organs have failed him. He is in an ICU room with several machines surrounding his exterior as if they are the only friends that will put a shoulder on him as he takes his last breaths of air. The doctor knows that this man has a slim chance, but only thinks of ways to improve his health, to better this man, to hopefully one day regain his consciousness. 

We make a few more rounds, seeing more patients in the process. As I shadow I see an infected labia, an infected knee replacement, an infected chest. He sees a woman looking to get out of the hospital to enjoy her life, a spirited woman with a wise-cracking sense of humor that is determined to regain her knees, and a boy with a desire to get out of the children’s oncology ward by beating leukemia and live a regular teenage life with his friends and go to school. This strikes me. Every doctor will consider what is wrong with the patient and attempt to fix that problem, but the great doctor sees the person as more important than the problem.

We visit a few more local hospitals. The most interesting case? As we visit one of our last patients, a elderly man in good health approaches the doctor from behind and greets him warmly. He shakes his hand. He remembers the doctor I walk with. They exchange some words as I stand back a few steps and let them enjoy a quick and personal chat. They shake hands and smile once again as they part ways. As we walk back to the doctor’s car, he tells me that ten years ago, the man that he just spoke with was in bad shape. He had an infection in his back, right by his spine. It is commonly reported that this particular disease the man had would be responsible for making all people scream in pain and agony because the pain was unbearable and intolerable. The man had at once considered his acceptance to die. The infectious disease doctor told me that he did all that he could to treat him back to great health, and here he is today—ten years later—remembering the doctor that saved his life and sincerely congratulating him for his help and assistance. 

Most freshman want to enter the medical field because they search for aspirations that their parents place on them. They want to seek success for themselves. They want to demonstrate their abilities and egos. Some sadly enter for the money. This shadowing experience that I reflect upon has been one of many examples that reinforce the fact that a great physician is one whose true currency is the amount of people that he can help. It is indicative of the underlying philosophy that the well should take care of the sick. It is genuine. It is truthful. It is something that I aspire to be one day, just as much as it should inspire other aspiring physicians to fulfill their greatest potential to help others. Your genuine love and compassion to help others should be greater than any other negative aspect that may stray you away from this important field. This is how I think, and it makes me smile every time I see this quality in young adults today, regardless of what they aspire to become.

**Share your stories, thoughts, and feelings. I am always curious as to how others think and perceive the field of medicine today. 

If you want to know a little more about me: I am going to be a senior this year as an undergraduate with a major in biology and minor in chemistry. I have chosen to take a year off after I graduate to further develop my ability to serve others and gain more experience before I apply to medical school. I have not taken the MCAT yet.

I start college in the fall and I know I want to go to med school. I've taken some neuroscience classes and it's my passion, so I'm going to be a neuroscience major. My school has some pretty good research opportunities and some pretty good premed advising, but I'm worried about volunteering. The closest hospital is 30 minutes away and they only accept auxiliary volunteers. Starting in my junior year, I'll have better access to a hospital that accepts all kinds of volunteers, but not during my freshman and sophomore year. A friend of mine suggested calling up local neurologists and surgeons and seeing if I can volunteer in their offices, which would mean I would shadow them occasionally as well. I already plan on being a part of the Medshare program, but I'm wondering, is this enough volunteering to get into a good medical school?
Also, how do medical schools look at study abroad, specifically a semester study rather than a summer study?",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,True,t3_ifdnv,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/ifdnv/some_questions/,

What can I do post-University to help give me a decent PA school application?,INGWR,9,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1jbhp9/one_year_left_at_uni_what_can_i_do_postuniversity/,"I've got one year left of getting a Bachelor of Science in Cellular/Molecular Biology with a minor in Chemistry. Ultimately I'd really like to go to PA school, but I definitely wouldn't get in right off the bat. My grades aren't terribly special (3.0 out of 4.0) and I don't have a whole lot of health experience besides working in a grocery store pharmacy and volunteering to work at an anatomy exhibit this summer. To that extent, I've done awesome in my upperclassmen biology classes (i.e. A's in both semesters of A&amp;P) and I'm taking a lot of electives (Disease Bio, Comparative Anatomy, Neurobiology of Addiction) that I wouldn't need to complete my major.

That being said, I probably need an intermediate between now and PA school/MD school/whathaveyou. My choices that I've seen are as follows:

* Pursue an Associate's in Radiologic Technology or Surgical Technology, work as a Rad Tech or Surg Tech for a little while, and apply to PA school every year going forward.

* Pursue a Master's in Public Health and use that as a stepping stone to apply to PA school. Other Master's programs could be Epidemiology, Health Administration (?), etc.

* Pursue an Associate's in Medical Assistance and work as a Medical Assistant for a little while, applying to PA school every year forward.

* A nearby state Uni offers a ""Pre-Medical Graduate Health Sciences"" graduate certification that helps post-grad premeds prepare for acceptance into their own med school. 

Are any of these ideas more viable than any other? Is there something I could do that I haven't thought of? I kick myself for not pursuing more hospital experience earlier in my time at a University, but I'm definitely going to try and get in the hospital (even if it's just volunteering) this year. I was hired to be an ER Scribe this summer, but I had to turn it down because I work 1-2 jobs just to stay in college.

I submitted most of my secondaries so I'm a bit early. I haven't had any interviews or selective secondaries received yet, but most schools haven't started interview requests thus far. I am obsessed with SDN and MDapplicants.com and visit them at least 20 times a day. I check my inbox at least three times an hour through my phone, mainly because I am distressed that I have not received invites or secondaries from the few schools that have begun such things.

I am not sure where this obsession is coming from or how to stop it, really. I'm just too driven to get in, and I am so hungry for that tidbit of information that will somehow make the difference between a 100% rejection cycle and getting in somewhere.

I know it's not healthy. It has taken its toll on me. After going through SDN and, ESPECIALLY, MDapplicants.com, the evidence seems as if to say stuff like 4.0/37 MCAT = 50% chance of rejection from all schools. According to MSAR, people with my race, GPA, and MCAT profile only have a 8-10% chance of full rejection, but honestly it seems like it's more like 50% in my head because of all this internet sleuthing. I've seen at least 9-10 profiles on MDapplicants.com where people with 4.0/37+ MCATs get 100% rejection.

I should be thankful of how I've done, but my habits have turned me into something that disgusts me. I get this ""fear of missing out"" syndrome where if I don't go on SDN I might miss some information I need to succeed.

What’s the best way to fix it? I have ADD. I do take short breaks (15 sec) between passages to keep my mind from wandering.

Thanks so much in advance!

3) How much is an appropriate range for practice scores to be confident in getting that score? Mine is a 4 point range (29-33). I thought it was having an upward trend until my most recent practice…

I was a top student (always #1 or #2) in high school and I did very well in my first year of university. I know what I'm capable of, academically and otherwise, and that the things I'm dealing with do not define who I am.

I know that it will be a difficult road for me in making it to medical school, but I'm willing to do everything I can to get there eventually. I'm just wondering if any of you has ever been where I am and would care to share your experience or offer some advice.

I know it might sound funny, but I am not trolling and I am dead serious. 

I have been quite the truth seeker and my love for science led me to some problems of objective truth. I used to be religious as a kid, but became atheist in college(atheist for 4 years). Anyways, I did this thing called Vipassana Meditation in 2010 and got into a state with constant panic attacks. You can read about it in this wikipedia article. Scroll down to where it talks about meditation:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_crisis#Handling_existential_crises

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassana_meditation

The only cure is to keep meditating and that is what I did. However, I was unable to get back into life. Family and friends slipped and I reached a really low point. I was on my way to be a doctor but here I am in this complete mess. I was the one who helped everyone during exams and here I am watching those same people start graduate studies. People always referred to me as the responsible and smart one--that is what I am known for(I was never the ladies man, the comedian, etc). I did manage to do a lot of volunteer work last summer(about 150 hours) so I am thankful for that. 

However, I have only recently interacted back with life. Trying to get back my old friendships and hobbies. I also feel like I am ready for medical school. I know I messed up and I am following the quote ""beggers can't choose""(honestly, I don't believe I messed up because I learned a lot from the intense meditation). I don't mind going to the Caribbean Medical schools and working myself up instead of DO. I am completely healthy now and have never been so motivated to start medical school. I took my MCATs last month(did bad but oh well--mainly because I had a panic attack during the test). 

So how should I go on about explaining this to Caribbean school interviewers/applications? My GPA is good enough for Caribbean Medical schools and I have the ECs. MY MCAT can do better and I will retake in January(I will study crazy until then). However, I want to just get on with my life and don't mind doing Caribbean MERP programs starting this January.

Graduated H.S. with 4.2x gpa with four AP courses in which I received three 4's and one 5 and entered uni the summer after. Now throughout my childhood family life has always been shaky between my Dad and the in-laws. Until about 2 years into school when my Mother attempted suicide and upon revival went back to her homeland(I'm 2nd gen) and hasn't spoken to me since. Accordingly I fell into some form of pediatric depression; no care about what happens to me and the people around me, exgf calling me crazy for having no emotional response to breaking up with me, etc... The two semesters after the incident left me with a shattered gpa and I was effectively expelled from school. Devastated I decided to get a job and work for the next 2 years until I decided to go back to school. (Safe to assume I got closure from the incident, although I'd rather not post what happened publicly you are more than welcome to PM)

This fall semester will be my 2nd year since I've restarted school at my community college. Straight A's like pre-meds should but I've yet thought about the possibility of transferring and entering the field of medicine. As of now my gpa is at 2.7 and I've switched my major from Chemistry, whilst at uni, to Physics. Out of the pre-reqs required for medicine I've W'd from the two semesters of Bio, C'd Gen. Chem I and B'd Gen. Chem II.

That's about it I would love any advice, criticism, what have you, that you can throw at me. If there's any more info that would help you, essentially, evaluate my chances of a medical career I'm more than happy to provide. Granted I'm writing this on a drunken whim I hope I can be as coherent as possible...

**tl:dr**

Proficient H.S. student encounters tragic incident while in College. Puts him in depression-&gt; academic explusion from school. 2 years after, going back to school at CC, straight A's so far, would love feedback from other non trads or any feedback you can offer.

* Is it simply an arbitrary threshold set by medical schools to increase competitiveness?

Both seem to have their legitimacy (I guess), but when you start factoring in individual experiences, some of the purely number stuff seems to go out the window (truly unique EC experiences for example). But most importantly, it seems to be the otherwise excellent outliers who get denied that really blow my mind.

For instance: 

* A student who does poorly his first round of college, comes back (or does an SMP), does amazing, but still only achieves a cGPA/sGPA of &lt;3.5, with an appropriately competitive MCAT as well. Gets rejected.

The other issue: I really don't like working with fruit flies, which is what the lab is all about. I'm not sure what I want to do...but I think I would definitely be more interested in some microbiology labs, etc.

Having two years of college left, I could take several of these courses, but at the expense of losing my minor in something that I'm very interested in. I've taken almost every standard pre-med course and am passably fluent in another language (although it unfortunately isn't Spanish or an Asian language like they recommended) and will be taking biochemistry soon, however these school's sites have been ambiguous as to whether lab matters for biochemistry or not. My school offers two versions of biochemistry: one through the Biology department and one through the Chemistry department. Both are intended for students that are majoring in their respective departments. The only difference I could see is that the chem version has a lab and the bio one does not. I, as a bio major, am taking the bio version without lab (though there is an extra hour once per week where the class is broken down into smaller groups and primary literature is discussed, but this in no way constitutes a lab). I was wondering how big of a difference it would make if I took the bio version instead of the chem version. 

Were I to take the chem version, I could also just take inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry and get a chem minor out of it (and satisfy the ""recommendations""), but again, I would lose my other minor (which I have only taken one class for so far, but still). 

I know that looking only at the top schools is unrealistic for any applicant, but I feel like I am a competitive application for them where I stand now in terms of GPA, current college, research, etc etc so I would definitely not like to be at a disadvantage when it comes to classes when I apply in a year.

Here's a list of what I've done...(I have a 3.9 GPA)

- 1 year research assistant in Crime and Law psychology lab. (6hrs a week)
     - Helped formulate questionnaires in a witness identification research study.
     - Posed as a person of authority to intimidate research participant's into choosing answers I wanted them to choose.
-  2 years research assistant in Social Psychology / Health Psychology lab. (7hrs a week)
     - Helped with design of social psychology experiments run on campus.
     - Input data.
     - Did field work at a hospital where we interviewed surgery patients and potential surgery patients to ask them about their care and examine the doctor patient relationship and how to improve communication between the two.
- 3 years academic coach for a program on campus. (6-8hrs a week ; 8-10hrs during midterms and finals)
     - Set up study group times where I tutored science classes.
     - Wrote practice problems and practice test problems for students. 
     - Set up one-on-one appointments with students who needed additional help.
     - Attended lectures sometimes if I never had the professor or the professor was doing things differently from the book.
     - Worked with students to improve study habits and time management.
- 1 year Biochemistry tutor. (2-4 hrs a week)
     - Chosen by professor to be a peer tutor because I ranked 3rd in a class of 250 (position is usually reserved for science majors but he made an exception for me because of my academic record and performance in his class).
     - Joined professors and TAs in meetings.
     - Attended lectures.
     - Set up appointments with students for tutoring.
- 3 months volunteering at local hospital (5hrs a week).
     - Photocopying paper work.
     - Cleaning children's toy.


I have 2 letters from science professors who they have hand picked me to tutor for after I finished taking their classes so they wrote me exceptionally strong letters.

EDIT: I don't mind asking you guys what your opinions are- I'll try and make it short.

one of my Pre- Helth advisors told me I was a waste of an applicant.

My current status is as follows- I graduated form a community with 3.7 gpa deans list and honor roll with Associates in L.A. I went to, and am currently in, Hunter College in nyc. The past 3 years I have had a difficult time coping with (what I now know as) some sort of heart arrhythmia and panic/anxiety disorder. As a result of this, my transcript is atrocious with every other class having a withdrawal ""W"" on it, a C in calculus and one F# in chem 1 because I was hospitalized early in the class, (they dont want to do anything about it but i MIGHT be able to change that to a ""W"") but retook that chem 1 class and received a B in it.

so My transcript will look like W W A W B B+ W A- B W B W etc.. it's very inconsistant and sporadic and my gpa overall is a 3.5 as well as my science. I also haven only taken the required pre reqs and nothing beyond the full 1 year of bio, year of chem, year of physics or year of orgo. (because of time being an issue and me wanting to apply as soon as I can)

I will JUST be done with those pre reqs this coming fall 2013 and would love to take the MCATs that following spring (Jan feb march).

I am very realistic with my situation and I plan on applying to nursing/PT/PA programs as well as medical schools but I dont want to go down without a fight.

now here are some of my questions-
1. How badly are the W's going to look/affect me?
2. Should I take more science classes out of the realm of just the pre reqs to either boost my sGPA or to help my chances.
3. Is it even a good idea to take the MCATs next spring with all things considering?
4. should I not even take the MCATs yet and maybe graduate with my english major from Hunter and maybe enroll into a Masters program to again, just boost my sGPA or to look like a stronger candidate?

any input is helpful

I kept falling behind on the schedule because I am taking classes full load at the same time, but I thought I was doing the best I could given the situation. I started doing practice exams last week. AAMC #3, 27 (9,10,9). I was shocked and discouraged. Convinced myself, you know, first time - no big deal. Took #4, 29 (10,10,9). Ok, improvement, but I gotta keep at it. Just took #5. 28 (10,9,9). Discouraged as hell.

I don't run out of time. I rarely make stupid mistakes. So it must be a content issue. I have always been terrible at standardized exams. I could postpone the exam, I probably should. I am doing full course load again this quarter though. 

Should stop saying ""I can't, I can't, I can,t..."" I will find a way. Can't stop trying here. Fuck, I'm bigger than MCAT. I can kick its ass. I am not gonna let this stupid test let me down.

I'm just finishing up my second semester in my undergrad and I'm considering a career as a physician. I've been looking at a lot of the posts here on r/premed and there seems to be two different realities of medical school admissions. 

On one hand, we have posters saying that they you basically need a 4.0, tons of research experience, awesome extracurriculars, and a good MCAT score to maybe be admitted. On the other, there are people asking if they have a good chance of admission with a lower GPA, test scores, etc. and the answer is usually ""probably"".

I guess my question is this:

As a person who has the ability to get solid (read: probably not stellar) grades, has tested well in the past, participates in a number of ec's, volunteers, and has research prospects, how realistic is admission to medical school? 

I know there are a million posts out there with more specific details about what their GPA is and their MCAT scores, but it's too early in my college career to be very sure about these things.

Hi everyone, like I said I've been thinking a LOT about medicine recently (in the US). My father is a gastroenterologist so I've always been around medicine but its never really called to me until the past 2-3 years or so. I know all the difficulties, my dad even rants about it all the time even though he enjoys it, but for some reason I can't get it out of my mind.

The problem is, I'm currently a sophomore in college studying for a business degree. From reading a lot of things on this sub I know that I lot of people start med school later now, but I want to know what kinds of things I could do in order to explore that direction more.

I'm actually currently looking to switch my major to political science, as I've realized that business is not at all for me. This switch is mainly due to the fact that, other than medicine, I'm really attracted to the idea of doing global development work with a non-profit, etc. On Tuesday I'm also going to look into the possibility of completing a science-business degree, since I already have the business aspects completed.

So specifically, my questions are this:

* What classes do you have to take in order to apply for med school? Are there general ones that must be taken?
* I'm mostly thinking about doing the poli-sci route at the moment, as it provides the most options and flexibility. So I would only be able to take a few science electives before graduating. Have any of you gone back to school after graduating in order to finish science requirements? If so, how did you do it and how long did it take?
* Basically, my last question would be to anyone who took a less traditional path to medicine. Specifically, how did you do it and why? I think hearing some other stories would really help me think about this some more.

I've recently done some searching online for stuff related to being premed and I've found some data which I found to be quite interesting.

First off, there's [this](http://www.umbc.edu/premed/pdfs/UMBCPreMedMedicalAcceptedApplicants.pdf). It lists a bunch of applicant profiles from UMBC who successfully made it into MD schools. Looking at some of these student profiles, I found it fascinating how:

* URM students may not have be on easy street to medical school after all. Compare student J (a URM student) to student S (non URM). J had significantly higher numerical stats versus S, and they applied to roughly the same number of schools. 

* I think it overall highlights the importance of ECs in combination to the numerical factors. A lot of these students have many, many different activities listed over lots of semesters. Perhaps this can help some of us as a metric for our own applications.

The second thing I found was [this blog](http://www.6medschool.com/2012/07/getting-into-and-failing-out-of-medical.html). I was reading through some of this guy's posts, and I think it definitely highlights the **wrong** way to approach being a premed (he had a low GPA/MCAT, never even applied to post bacc/graduate progams, I would argue was *too* invested in his ECs, and generally seemed to be full of himself, etc). Also, to anyone considering the Caribbean route, take note of what he writes about his experiences. Its a painful read, but I think its a worthwhile cautionary tale.

If it helps, the semester after the violation, I got a 4.0 term GPA with a full credit load of upper level science classes.  Maybe I could try to correlate that to increased focus I got as a result of the violation (which is true, I felt like I had to make up for the violation some how so I put in 110%)?

I don't know, tbh.  I'm pretty concerned about the fact that I'll have to disclose a conduct record...

So I'm currently sitting at a 3.1 gpa after completing all my prerequisite BCPM courses in a BS in biology. However, I've started taking my upper level science courses this semester, and I'm doing really, really well in them (final grades are looking like: A,A, and B+ maybe an A). Since I now need to fulfill my elective requirements, I've decided to go for both a concentration in molecular biology and a minor in chemistry. The reasons are two-fold: 

1) this provides me a way to get enough credits to bring my gpa up to a more competitive level by the time I graduate in spring of 2014.

2) I've gotten really close with my professors in these courses (they will be teaching a majority of my upcoming upper levels), and they are very willing to write me fantastic LORs.

Unfortunately,I've calculated it out and by the time the deadline to apply for the premed committee letter comes (fall 2013) my gpa will be insufficient (3.39 tops, minimum requirement is a 3.4) to get it. I'm kind of annoyed by this since I've found out that many med school applications will ask for a formal committee letter, and if you don't have one, they'll want to know why. My reasoning is it will be because I wanted to include some of the LORs from my CC professors (got an AA in liberal arts, 3.4 gpa) which would fulfill my nonscience LOR requirement anyways.

So basically I just want to see if what I'm planning out would be a good way of going about getting in to med school. 

So first a little of my background so far. I am a senior in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry, with an overall GPA of about 2.8, science 2.9 (really low I know).  I have my reasons for this, mostly it was being lazy my freshman/sophomore year before I really knew I wanted to do med school. But it was also that I have ADHD and didn't get diagnosed until the summer before my junior year (last year).  Last year I did really well (both semester's GPA above 3.2), and I'm doing well again this year.  I also have my EMT-B license and have over 400 hours of volunteer experience with patient contact (I'm in an EMS club at my university and we have tons of volunteer opportunities).  I am also helping teach an EMT-B course through said club right now.  I haven't taken the MCAT yet as I've been trying to focus on my school work and volunteering, but I plan on taking it this coming summer. I've also shadowed a few doctors too.

So here's what I was planning on doing.  I'm thinking of taking a year off from school and working on an ambulance to make some money.  During this ""year off"" I want to apply to some GPA boosting post-bacc programs so I can prove that I can handle the tough course load of medical school.  Then assuming I get into a program, it's just a matter of doing well in the classes.

I just wanted to know if this seemed like a good idea to other people, and if anyone knows anything about these GPA boosting post-bacc programs that would help too! :)

Thanks in advance for your opinions!

I did some volunteering in undergrad (Red Cross and tutoring), and I am interested in tutoring during my time off because I enjoy it. However, I haven't really had much clinical experience/experience with patients, so I am looking at volunteering positions at local hospitals. Unfortunately the best I can find right now is a messenger/patient transporter position, but I'll keep looking.

Apart from the volunteering and occasional shadowing, I was wondering if there are any suggestions for what I should do?

I had asked some earlier here and was surprised at how helpful and quick the community was to give well thought out and intelligent answers. 

My current dilema is this, I have been accepted at SLU medical school for some time now and have gone out to find housing etc. Today I just received notification that I am accepted to NYU SOM as well. NYU is a great school and I loved it during my interview but have some reservations about changing so much so late in the game. 

So here it is r/premed: do you think it is worth the additional worry, work, and arrangements to attend NYU? It should be noted that I am married so finding housing in New York may be a dififculty for me as the school doesn't guarantee housing for incoming married students. I also have been offered a scholarhsip of 10,000 for the first year at SLU that would likely be renewed each year and have received no such aid offer from NYU. I do NOT exprect to receive aid from them fwiw

Thanks in advance guys.

Around this time last year, I began my journey and submitted an application for 35 medical schools and programs. I was ecstatic to receive secondaries and a bit bummed out to realize many of them were automatic secondaries sent to everybody. It wasn't until December 23rd that I got a call for my very first interview. By then I was worried beyond relief. Everyone else I knew had already interviewed and here I was, preparing for for my first interview in February.

A few weeks went by and I received another phone call to set up my second interview at another school. It was the last interview I received. I was rejected from my dream school (the first phone call) and wait listed near the middle of the second school. 

I've spent the last few weeks preparing another application and was about to submit my application later today when I received a phone call. Of all the schools I applied to, of the two schools I interviewed at, on the day before I submitted a second primary application; I was finally accepted. 

I know applications were open for submission beginning yesterday so to those of you who are applying this year: GOOD LUCK! 

There will be many days where you may question yourself. There may be times when it seems like your dream will never come to fruition or you may feel that you aren't good enough. It's a competitive process but I urge you to use whatever emotion you're feeling, be it depressing or inspiring, and turn it into your motivation to succeed. Feeling good after getting a secondary? Fuck yeah, let's go research the school and fill that sucker out! Feeling down about the whole process? That means now's the time for action! Let's go! Be methodical, efficient, and patient. Make sure you pace yourself because if you're like me (most of you will have a much easier time than I did), you could be in the race for a while. Keep calm. Don't panic.

When you're working on a secondary or preparing for an interview, focus yourself completely on the task at hand. When you have the free time to relax, make sure you relax. Hang out with your friends. Tell your parents about the process. Form the support group you're going to need throughout this process and offer support to everyone who's also seeking it (friends applying to other grad programs, looking for jobs, etc.). Definitely pick up a hobby in the meantime, it will keep you sane and provide an outlet. There will be plenty of waiting. I put on a few pounds in college so I got a gym membership and started working out with a small group of friends. It feels amazing and we're all better people because of it. 

This is a long process. There's no denying it. But with the right state of mind, the proper amount of motivation, and some support you can all do it!

So, first semester of college last year went well besides for the C+ in Gen Chem 1. My other classes were A- Med Ethics, A- English Writing, and B Biology. All told, I have 2 A-'s, 2 B's, 2 B-'s, 2 C's, 1 C+, and a D. My GPA is sitting at a 2.6. My second semester, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer and interned at a law firm over last summer. I was a Resident Assistant last semester, but I was under so much psychological duress I had to resign. It's also the semester that I earned the D in Gen Chem 2. I am retaking it and hopefully will get a B/B+ if the final goes well. 

I don't know if it would do any good to outline exactly what transpired in my personal life. After all, this isn't about garnering sympathy, it's about getting myself to where I want to go. It revolved around my father getting back in touch with his ex from twenty years ago. This drama started in senior year of high school. This situation set off a cascade of events that didn't just bring into question many things that I was taught by my father, his actions felt like they destroyed them. Things at home got so much worse, especially for my little brother (was 14 at the time, now is 16).

Basically guys, I've been through hell. I've plumbed the lower depths of human despair and after what seems like the longest time, I feel that I have finally made it out. Where I was, I was a different person. That guy earned the 2.6. The current me, the one from before all this stuff happened, would have been doing stellar. But my grades aren't going anywhere and I have only forward to look. I figured it's time to put pride behind me and candidly ask if, looking forward, I'm not chasing a mirage.

Average accepted is a 30 with a 3.6 gpa. I'm worried my gpa is on the lower side and maybe he was just being nice? I really don't care if I go MD or DO, I just want to be a doctor. Not really a fan of the idea of Caribbean schools though. 

**Side note:** I plan to take a kaplan prep course, any advice/reviews on that is greatly appreciated!

Sorry for the length. Thanks for reading!

**Edit** Thanks everyone for all the input! Not really set on MD but my state only has one DO school that I know of, so it complicates things a bit. Pretty much what I got from this was that it's possible, pending some factors. Which is pretty much what the adviser told me but it helps to have multiple opinions confirming that.

3.78/4.0 gpa. Chemistry major/music minor.

29 MCAT (11 PS, 10 BS, 8 VR). I decided to retake in January. 

I've been working in a chemistry research lab since sophomore fall (including summers). I'm second author on a recent publication and am hoping to have 1-2 more by the time I graduate. I'm also planning on doing an honors thesis on my research. 

I'm a rower for my school and will have done it all four years. 

I'm in a sorority and have held officer positions and have done lots of volunteer and philanthropy work. 

I've shadowed many different doctors in a shadowing program through my school (about 50ish hours)

I was a violinist in the school orchestra for two years. I've played piano since I was five.

I participated in a mentoring program for two years helping high schoolers through the college application process. 


I've spent a lot of time recently trying to decide what to do in my year between undergrad and medical school. My question is will what I do in that year matter to my application? I will be submitting my primary application in early June 2014, before or at the start of any gap year activities. 

I know I want to do something in my gap year that will enhance my application, be enjoyable to do, and help me save money. I think my weakest points in my application (disregarding my mcat) are volunteering and clinical experience. I would love to have a job that entails clinical experience, like being a medical scribe or assistant. I don't think I can have a job like that while still in school given a busy schedule. I figure that I can do some long-term volunteering my senior year of college as it won't be as demanding time-wise. I worry though that by waiting to gain more in depth clinical experience until after my primary is sent will hurt me. Is there anywhere on secondaries that ask about gap year activities? I figure it will come up in interviews, but I need to get interviews first :)

Let me cut to the chase.  My freshman year I did quite well, not amazing, but something I look at and feel proud to have done.  By the end of my sophomore year I made too many poor choices but I did get an offer to do some research at UIUC.  I took that offer, in hopes that the experience would look great on any medical school application.  


The research went great and while I was only supporting the work of graduates, I worked hard and can still count on a very strong recommendation from the professors at the lab.  However, my choices when it came to nightlife spiraled into a shitstorm and I absolutely neglected my grades.  I saw that the cost of tuition was far too much for what I was doing and I left for my homestate to just recoup close to home and finish up a degree.


At this point I had abandoned my dream of becoming a doctor and went into marketing as it was something I liked.  It didnt take more than half a year to realize that I hated not only the real world application of marketing.  So I took a semester off (which I should have done much sooner) to get my head straight.  I decided to go back into the sciences and finish up my degree, maybe I would go into a healthcare field.  


Two years later and here I am, I have brought my grades from a pretty strong downward spiral from as low as a 2.8 to a 3.24 that should be a 3.35 by end of summer and a 3.5-3.6 (ish) for the past 60 hours after the fall is complete.


Anyways, I am now very much looking at PA school as a profession I should have a reasonable shot at entering.  But it would be a great regret of mine if I didnt atleast look at medical school.


So you have my grades, I have yet to take the MCAT, and here are some accolades and similar items I've earned throughout college:

-Roughly 120 hours shadowing a PA

-&gt;250 hours shadowing general surgeons

-Student government association senator (2007-2009)

-Head of programming and risk management for my fraternity (which held a &gt;3.15GPA)

-Ellie Magnuson Scholar recipient, Merit-based (2007-2009)

So, the story: I filed for a medical leave of absence at the end of February. I was in a really deep emotional hole and I was struggling in my day to day activities. 

I spoke to Academic Advising and they repeatedly told me I would not get Ws on my transcript, rather my semester would show up as blank. It was a really difficult decision to take the medical leave and I ultimately decided on taking it because of this. 

I'm happy to say that I've made enormous progress in these five months. However, I looked the other day at my online transcript and I have the Ws. 

The Vice President of Enrollment Management and Student Life, whom I spoke to yesterday, offered to write a letter for all my applications explaining why the Ws are there. However, I feel as that's a bandaid for the situation and petitioning a Dean or two and getting them changed.

The Refund Appeal Form, which I submitted after I did my leave, was an appeal to a committee for being forgiven for charges by the University (due to financial aid, I was charged a substantial amount of money). The Vice President tells me I was supposed to indicate in the letter to have my grades blanked, although the person at Academic Advising never mentioned this.

Basically, the VP said he can't do anything about it and no one likes changing transcripts. He also said that I need this adviser to admit they misadvised me and Enrollment Management can work their magic.

What do I do? Ask a person to publicly claim their mistake, and petition within the university if that doesn't work?

Sorry for the wall of text, this is a blow to me. I've had a lot of ups and downs and 4 Ws in one semester is a pain. I can definitely fight this but man, what a bummer.

Update: I called and talked to academic advising and explained the situation. I knew the name of the person who originally helped me file for leave. I also emphasized that he was immensely helpful and that I didn't want his reputation to be affected by the situation. I should be getting a call back tomorrow.

2) Double majored in Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry

7) Good letters of recommendation from professors, employer, and several physicians (working on getting committee letter of rec in the fall)

Turned out I scored 1 point exactly below the necessary amount to get an A for the final. So, with all the grades in, I was sitting at a 92.1 and needed a 92.5 for an A. The exams were normalized and the previous ones had only given curves of 0.2-0.3, so I was naturally freaking out. The curve posted days later, with me sitting at a 92.55.

(with pros and cons),SweatyBobby,7,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1ecacx/opinions_on_studying_6_months_for_the_mcat_begin/,"So I'm faced with a difficult decision right now -- I can either start studying now for the MCAT in August/September or I can start studying now (or work on VS/speedreading/etc.) for the January MCAT in 2014.  Keep in mind I just finished my sophomore year.


Pros and cons for each:

*If I take it at the end of this summer (Aug/Sep):*

**PROS:**

1. I will have a 3 month block of dedicated study time (I want to follow SN2ed's program) leading up to the test
2. the material from the pre-reqs will be fresher in my head (I have finished them all as of this semester)
3. I'll have ample time to retake if necessary
4. I'll know my score sooner

**CONS:**

1. I haven't taken a few courses which would help a lot (I'll get to those below)
2. I don't have a completely empty summer (I'd like to shadow/volunteer a bit, visit a friend for a week, and go on a family vacation for another week)
3. I don't have all the materials needed for SN2ed as of now (lacking TBR which I heard can take a while to get)
4. Grade could possibly expire (not likely though)

*If I take it at the end of winter break (Jan)*


**PROS:**

1. I will have taken Biochem, Genetics, Physiology, and an Anatomy Lab (all enrolled for this upcoming fall semester)
2. I'll have more time to work on my reading speed (I read pretty slowly) this summer as well as brush up on content
3. I'll have more time to shadow and volunteer
4. The summer will be way more enjoyable :P

**CONS:**

1. I have an entire fall semester courseload to deal with so I can't study NEARLY as much as I want to until December 18 (biggest con being I probably won't be able to do SN2ed :/ )
2. I will be a year (or more) removed from nearly all of the prereq classes 
3. I will only have one month of dedicated study time
4. I'll likely forget any material I study this summer by then


I have read that 3 months is ideal because after that you likely won't remember what you studied before then, but I am really on the fence.  Any of premeddit's opinions would be appreciated greatly!

I'm trying to decide which medical school I should go to, but having a tough time. I've gotten an offer from McGill, but on May 14 I find out whether I get offers from UofT, Mac, Queens, Ottawa and Western. I've tentatively ruled out Western, Queens, since they're not big city centers, and I don't think I would get exposure to the same kind of interesting medical cases that I might in a major urban area with a top-of-the-line hospital, and I've ruled out Ottawa for the same reason (sure it's a big city, but wouldn't the complex cases just get referred somewhere else?)

I've tentatively ruled out McMaster as well, since I don't think getting my degree done in 3 years would give me the research experience, or vacation time, that I need, and might make it more difficult to match to competitive specialties (like neurosurgery or anaesthesiology).

So it seems to come down to McGill vs. UofT. Can anyone weigh in? I've done my undergrad at McGill, but my parents live near Toronto.

Pros for UofT:

Full-body, hands-on dissections (no other school does this to their extent)

Tons of affiliated hospitals and research

~5-6k non-repayable grant per year

Parents and highschool friends live nearby

Cons:

Really large class

Costs a lot more than McGill

Lots of lectures, traditional didactic teaching method

Perhaps not as much patient contact until rotations

Pros for McGill:

Also a good research center, with lots of hospitals (not sure how it stacks up with UofT)

New curriculum, with more patient contact early on, and fewer lectures

Practicing medicine in English and French

Lower cost of living than in Toronto

Cons:

Lower amount of loans from OSAP, but it's like 5000 dollars cheaper anyway

More mandatory-attendance tutorials instead of lectures which are recorded (so I wouldn't have to be there)

Would I have to practice in Quebec afterwards? If not, would it be harder to practice elsewhere?

Somewhat worse hospital system than in Ontario

Any issues with me being an Out-of-province student?



There are probably tons more factors to consider, can anyone think of any? Could anyone weight in on the relative importance of different factors, or comment on whether I'm incorrect my assessment so far?

The only problem is that for me to apply to med school I have to take a variety of pre-med courses that are outside of the standard engr curriculum, adding another year to my degree, which is also expensive, and while I realize that if I get into med school it would be worth it, if I don't (which is quite probable) then I will have wasted time/money etc... 

The other major issue is the grading, engineering tends to be very demanding and as a result what is a very respectable GPA in my faculty is considered average in the other faculties, I don't want to make it sound like engineering is harder than traditional premed, because it isn't, I find that the profs just tend to care less about grading because the majority of their students don't have aspirations outside of engineering (""A b+ is a great grade! good for you....."" style of thinking) How can those grades compete to get into med schools with those who average A/A+'s, I have taken courses outside my faculty and ended up with A/A+ marks. 

In conclusion I am asking two questions: 1)Do you think that Engineering students have a higher chance of getting into med school?  2) Do you think it is worth it to take the pre-reqs for med school, regardless of me getting in or not? and just hope for the best?

I am a junior at FIU and studying for my MCAT to take it April 4th. During that same time i am taking 10 credits being orgo II , math and psy. Which studying for the tests in those classes takes more time then i thought it would. In January my practice mcat was a 25 after one month of review and very little practice and one month of just practice i got it up to a 27 so barely any change. I still have spring break to take some more practice tests see if i manage to get any where near a 30 and take the real mcat.

The other option i am considering is to just take the real mcat but void it(take it for simulation/practice) then not take any summer classes which i would have to do to graduate in 2014 if i was going to apply this June. and just study for the mcat after 3 months of nothing but mcat i know i will be able to get 30+ take it in august, graduate around December 2014 and apply June 2014 which would leave me a gap 6 months before med school. 
Also currently my GPA is a 3.3 but if i wait till next june of 2014 i am sure it will be a 3.5. 
With regards of everything else on the application i have great shadowing/clinical exp and volunteer work so that doesn't change things and the gap will be only 6 months long after i submitted my application so not like medical school will see that.

Clinical experience/volunteering? ,heartsinit,10,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/18p9ub/quitting_phd_clinical_experiencevolunteering/,"I'm a student in the first year of my PhD studies, but I realized when I chose straight PhD instead of MD/PhD that I made a huge mistake.   
I took the MCAT in june of 2011 (so it should be good for 1 more cycle right?) and got a 34S.  (PS11 VR11 BS12).  I have probably about 50 hours of volunteering, all of which is in an area for which I have passion and can talk about at length (STEM education in rural/underrepresented populations.)  While this fits in well with my #1 school (Univ. Washington), it is not any type of 'clinical' volunteering.  Furthermore, I will probably only have around 40-50 hours of clinical shadowing (cardiothoracic and plastic surgery).    My LoRs and grades are good (4.0 UG 4.0 graduate).  
The problem: is my failed foray into academia going to destroy my chances?  I have plenty of good reasons for dropping my PhD and should be able to make it out with a MS in the spring of 2014, which would set me up perfectly to start in the fall of 2014.  Furthermore, my research experience (thousands of hours, 2 pubs, one on the way) clashes with my clinical experience (~50), which will make it hard to explain why I quit something that I had LOTS of knowledge about for a field that I have barely explored.  
My questions: 
1.  Is the 50ish hours enough shadowing to convince an admissions board that I have put plenty of thought into this?  I can talk at length about why I don't want a PhD, and I can explain why I think the Master's is something that will help me make an impact in my field (with clinical research and logical thinking process).  I can explain all the parts about medicine that intrigue me and why I think I'd be a good fit (although it's trite- I really do want more personal contact, think I'm good with people, and want to have a bigger impact on patient care than I would in a lab).  
2: Is this something I should address in my personal statement, or leave it for interviews/secondaries?

3: It's possible that I have an application that doesn't mention that I started a PhD, and that I am into my master's (which I have recently 'downgraded' to), should I? I don't want to seem like I'm 'hiding' anything.

A quick background about myself: 

-Age - 28
-Married with a baby boy on the way in June
-English Education Degree from Auburn in 2007 with a GPA of 3.02
Rough freshman and sophomore years - got my act together junior and senior years  
-Been teaching English with ESL and special ed inclusion since January 2008.  
-Rather accomplished musician with a lot of experience teaching and performing
-Wife works full time and wants to continue working even after having the baby
- I'll be quitting teaching at the end of this year to focus on getting into medical school

I'm currently taking a statistics class as a postbacc.  I need to take all of my pre-med science courses, but I already have calculus on my resume.  I have no clinical experience, no volunteer hours, and no shadow experience.  No research experience either.  

Here's what my premed advisor suggested:  

- Take classes as a postbacc with a maximum of two per semester and one per summer and of course, make a 4.0
- Get a job that makes money in the least amount of time.  I can make $1400/month on teaching guitar alone just two days a week.  She said not to worry about clinical experience with my job. 
- Get involved with a volunteer organization at least once a week.  Should be something I enjoy and feel connected to and not something that is necessarily ""clinical.""  
- Shadow doctors - as many as possible
- Score at least a 32 on the MCAT
- Kick ass in the interview

She claims that my teaching experience and my voluntary decision to teach ESL and special ed inclusion will do a lot in terms of impressing the adcoms and enables me to spend less time on getting clinical hours volunteering and more time on other things.  

She also said that research isn't necessary in my case.  

My plan is to see if I can use my guitar teaching to help me volunteer somewhere.  Either at a local hospital as a teacher/performer or volunteering at an autism center and giving autistic kids guitar lessons.  

Here are my questions: 

1.  I'm thinking about going full time as a student and pursuing a neuroscience degree.  For one, it will give me more hours to help boost my low gpa.  I will also have access to more professors for LORs.  If I just do premed classes, the highest my gpa can be raised is a 3.2, which is still really low.  Neuroscience classes (with a 4.0) will bring it up to a 3.35, which is still relatively low, but it will give me more of an upward trend.  Also, it'll be nice to have something tangible in hand when I'm finished instead of just a bunch of pre-med classes.  Good idea or no? 

2.  Is my volunteer idea sufficient, or should I focus more on direct patient interaction at a hospital?  

3.  Do you agree that my experience as an English teacher helps me get past the initial cut off?  

I'm shooting for UAB medical school or South Alabama if that helps.

I recently finished an EMT course kind of on a whim in community college and I'm thinking about taking that up instead.

But having a family that kept paying my classes for me and telling me to do well and me being the stubborn guy I was and not understanding my problem I kept going back, even asking admissions for forgiveness a few times.  Ultimately I ended up amassing a whopping 75 credits at a lovely 1.55 GPA in all sorts of 100-level classes (I know, I was dumb) and dropped out, figuring I just didn't have what it took.

Now I'm 32.  About two years ago I was diagnosed with depression and put on anti-depressants and therapy.  Since then I feel like I have been born again.  I found myself with so much passion, desire, energy and drive that I almost immediately found my old pace of life completely unfulfilling.  I decided I only get one chance to follow my dream and went back to school with the sole mission of getting my Bachelor's in Biomedical Science.  This semester is my third back, with my last two yielding me straight A's for my hard work!  But now I'm starting to look a little more forward and wondering if I shouldn't shoot for the moon and try to get into med school.  The only thing is I don't know if there is anything under the sun I could possibly do at this point to be admitted.  Even if I finish my degree from here on out perfectly and do everything I can to boost my GPA I might still only have a 2.8 cumulative.  And assuming I get an average MCAT score (the most rational assumption until I take it) I don't know if they would see me as a person with a 2.8 GPA work ethic or a person with a newly-found 4.0 work ethic. 


**TL;DR** I guess what I want to know is if a 34-year old guy (how old I'll be when I start if I get in to Med School) who has shown a significant uptrend in grades might get an exception bump for his circumstances if his stats were otherwise not good enough.",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,False,,,True,t3_17bu8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/17bu8m/do_med_school_admission_boards_treat_a_candidates/,

I'm 20 and a sophomore in college, majoring in art and psychology, considering dabbling in Japanese and/or Russian and maaaaaaybe theater arts. I'm a bit of an odd case, I want to practice art therapy (I need my art therapy license and an MA in Art therapy, which in the state of Oregon can only be acquired at Marylhurst oooooor if I get a doctorate,I don't need the MA in art therapy apparently) but I also want to go into clinical psychology or psychiatry. I haven't decided which as of yet, but I want my options open, and it's kind of a dream of mine to be accepted to OHSU for their MD/PhD combo program for psychiatry. Aside from the fact that I'm going to have to take my PreMed courses veryyyyy slowly because I struggle in math and science (I'm very good at psych, especially art therapy courses and BioPsychology), I'm not really sure how to get into the world of extra curriculars and what would be helpful and what might be harmful and what will help me to stand out. I am also looking into the PsyD programs at Pacific and George Fox, but I'm not sure if any of this is helpful to those. OHSU is my main goal though.

I've been looking into volunteering at Doernbecher (the children's hospital at OHSU) and I've also been looking into trying to volunteer or intern at the VA hospital, where my friend and sometimes my father go to. I'm worried though that these may be too generic? However, I'm not really sure what is considered better than others.

Meanwhile, Ive been told that a well rounded education is good and preferred for med school, but is studying fine arts and eventually performing arts going to cause me more harm than help? Would it perhaps be useful to take an EMT course or something? Should I maybe go for my MA in art therapy or psych before going onto trying for OHSU, George Fox, and Pacific?

Do you have any other helpful pointers for me?

I'm not sure what information I should give about myself presently because my college history is a bit unusual and a bit rocky,but I'm determined to go out of school with an amazing GPA. I know it's probably really early to be thinking this much to things, but my entire school life and heck, even my normal life as I know it (I've changed up pretty much my entire life by choice and by awkward circumstances involving my adoption and other things) so I feel like I really need to do whatever I can to keep all of my options open now and as long as possible, and to be able to try and achieve my dream. Down the road I may look into a few other med schools as well, but OHSU is my main choice.

Thank you and I'm sorry if any of this sounds a bit awkward, I'm on my iPad (which tried to autocorrect to MySpace) and I'm suffering a bout of insomnia.

The need for bodies in med school makes a ton of sense to me, but I'm curious about the effect of one body:  

* Does it just mean that two future-docs won't have to share a body? How big of a difference does that make to someone's education?   

* Do you think it's likely to improve that eventual doctor's ability/knowledge to the extent that lives will be saved?  

* How does that number of lives saved compare to the tangible and immediate lives that could be saved from transplanting my organs?  

* How many critical organs from a typical organ donor are salvageable/transplantable?

* What percentage of organ donors end up actually being able to donate viable organs?

 [U]Personal Story:
[/U]

I came to the US when I was 15 as an illegal immigrant. My family and I did not enter the country illegally but we were not supposed to stay and we did. My family is  made up of my mother (single mother) and my younger sister. We survived with my mother's under the table salary while my sister and I finished high school. After high school my mother was able to get a work visa so I was able to get a social security and apply to college. However, since I was not a US citizen or Permanent resident I paid for the first 2 years of college out of pocket. I did not care I was to happy focused on the fact that I had the opportunity to go to college. Because of my education expenses and the necessity to help my family financially I worked a 35 + hours as a vet tech for the first 2 years of college and my GPA reflects the lack of time to study and turn ""B's"" into ""A's"" . After a while of not being able to apply for a green card I proposed to my boyfriend at the time and we got married. The marriage was a disappointment as he was expecting me to be the epitome  “Hispanic wife” cook, clean and make babies and I had different plans for my life, I wanted to be a Doctor. The marriage ended but I was able to get my Green Card out of the deal so it was not a total waste of time. After the green card, I qualified for Financial Aid so I was able to work less time to still help my family financially but I did not have to pay for school. As I started taking upper division courses I applied for a Work Study research position at a lab in my School where I stayed for 4 years. This research experience and the fact that I was working on my own project got me the “honors” of my degree. After I graduated, I was not able to apply right away because I wanted to return the favor and have my mother go back to school (In the US for her masters) She was by then a resident as well so she was able to go to college. While she was in school she started working PT and  worked FT as a Science Teacher for in a low income, low performance, 100% minority Middle School . With my teacher’s salary I was able to support my mother and sister while they were both in college. I was also able to increase my student’s passing score in the state’s science test by 75% .   I currently switched to working as a medical Scribe in an ER and both my mother and sister are 1 semester away from graduation!  We all 3 will become citizens at the end of this month and despite the struggle, all the sacrifices and the suffering, my mother and sister have always been there to support me. We learned to survive by supporting each other and slowly but surely we have made progress. Until recently, I would have never revealed the fact that I stayed in this country illegally or that I got my green card through marriage. The only motivation I had to even post this is a recent episode of the show NY med where one of the surgeons openly revealed having entered this country illegally.  
 Is this subject still taboo? Is it important to mention it in my personal statement? It is the main reason why I am on the “low end” of the GPA scale for med schools. Working almost FT and studying FT was exhausting and some days I just did not have any energy left in me. I don’t know how to better explain this.  Any advice of previous applicants is appreciated

I was then admitted to a top-notch public school. When I began college, I struggled a lot, both financially and academically. At the time, I was taking 19+ units every semester, which ended up hurting my science GPA a lot. During my third year, I realized the huge mistakes I'd made, and began taking school more seriously; but it was too late. I had already gotten the following grades
Calc A (B)
Calc B (C+)
Org I (B-)
Org II (C)
Bio I (C)
Bio II (B-)
English I (A-)
English II (C+)
Gen Chem (B)

Beginning my third year, I began getting A's and B's in my science classes and all A's on my Foreign Lang. classes. (I am a Biology and Foreign Lang. major) My GPA now is 3.4. I find myself depressed often because of how much I screwed up my first two years, but that can't be changed. I have considered abandoning my med school dream, but I can't accept it and I know I wouldn't be happy doing something else. I therefore began retaking classes. I have finished the first summer session and so far I have gotten an A+ (English II) and an A (Math II). I finished undergrad in May (4 yrs) but I decided I will come back in the Fall to retake both semesters of Orgo to make up for my B- and C. Eventually I plan on doing a post-bacc and retaking Bio. I guess, my question is, do you think retaking classes is a wise decision? Do I even have a chance of being admitted?

I'm a Chemical Engineering major going into my senior year. I'm planning on applying to Medical School in the next application cycle (~May 2013).


I've been lurking this subreddit as well as SDN for the past couple of weeks and it seems like most people apply/get accepted with 3.7+ GPA's. This is a little disheartening considering that I'm entering my senior year with a 3.4ish GPA. 


From the research I've done, adcoms don't care what your undergraduate major is when it comes to GPA. **How true is that statement? And is there really anything I can do about it at this point?** Realistically speaking, my GPA won't increase with 100+ hours under my belt - I'm expecting to graduate with the same 3.4ish GPA. 


Also, do they take into account the rigor of the program you're in? For example, the ChemE program I'm in is top 5 in the nation and a 3.4 GPA is considered impressive in my department and is really hard to maintain.

My credentials are as followed:

Gpa: 3.12 *I know It's on the lower end and I am working to pull it up. The reasoning behind this is due to a German class(of all things) and Calc I/Calc II.

Perspective MCAT (Based off practice tests/online tests): 33 (no writing yet, English is my minor so I am not to worried)

Clinical experience: I work at an open wound clinic where I interact with chronically ill patients (Diabetics, Geriatrics) 
Current Hours put in is around 60.

Shadow: I currently shadow 2 MDs at said clinic and I am looking to shadow a D.O. (60 hours)

Research: I have yet to do any research, I am currently looking for a position at my college and should have one by next year.

Other notable extra curricular activities:
English tutor- My English gpa is a 4.0 so I teach my peers.

4 Year rock climber/ instructor- I have competed, and currently teach ropes courses to kids for climbing, repelling, and safety.
Avid Kayaker and Hiker as well.

Volunteer at Interfaith Clinic (around 35 hours so far)- I help distribute and categorize Medications to those who cannot afford medication in my community. This is one of my favorite activities next to clinical work.

Meals on wheels/ Habitat for Humanity/ Charity work for the Catholic Diasises (sp?)of my region/ Empty stocking fund/ Angel Tree Association.

I have been toying with the idea for a long time of applying to medical school. Coincidentally, I'm not much interested in practice per se, but definitely medical research (clinical trials), health administration, and humanitarian work all of which I have pretty considerable work experience.

My background is actually in mathematics and statistics, I got a BS in maths in 03 with a thesis on the modeling of neural networks and the sleep wake cycle using knowledge of the biochemistry of the brain. I then got an MS in biostatistics and did thesis work on risk prediction, health management, and triaging of high end imaging for breast cancer. I've since worked with an HMO doing practice based assessment of performance and with clinical trials doing randomization, statistical analysis, manuscripts, etc.

A wealthy friend of the family had heard me speak of medical school and was tremendously supportive. Much to my surprise, he offered to help out financially as best he could! I had never considered this option due to the price tag but, as he told me thus, smiled tremendously and said, ""Your family needs at least one doctor, absolutely!""

The one hurdle I see in all this is that I have practically no lab science experience. I got a straight 4 in my physics sequence but that was all that was required for my program and I had focused on other things. Given that I'm not as interested in practice, I'm wondering to what extent I can excuse this by pointing out I would intend to work in management, research, or evaluation.

My biggest drive in all this is that I feel I'm a creative person and I like to do much out of love. I do enjoy quantitative work, but so often my job involves being a much more nose-to-the-protocol kind of individual. The pay could be better. And last but not least, and certainly a compliment to all of you, I think this stuff is tremendously cool. I've always tried to go above-and-beyond what was required in terms of my medicine/biology knowledge. I hound wikipedia and google scholar for medical studies and outcomes and knowledge about new genetic tests and biomarkers for rare disease and all this really cool stuff.

I would like to hear your thoughts based on having walked that road: if you were advising someone like me, what would you say? What would be important to learn before hand? Would I be destined for failure or is there a strong promise of success?

tl;dr- work experience in medicine through quantitative work, kind of tired of numbers, little academic experience but a great deal of drive!

I'm currently a sophomore student pursuing an undergraduate degree in neuroscience with a minor in psychology. My program covers the majority of the premedicine requirements including the introductory chemistry, biology, physics, and calculus with the exception of the two semesters of organic and, my school recommended, 5 hours of biochemistry. I've been working in a neuropsychological laboratory with children on adaptive executive functioning, and I've had a large amount of exposure to the graduate neuroscience and psychology department, but I've mostly scrapped any plans to pursue graduate study in neuroscience. Additionally, I've become somewhat jaded with the graduate psychology programs (I know many of these share thin lines in their distinctions). I will suffix this with the fact that I am continuing to love my undergraduate curriculum however.

My university is very research oriented, and while I completely respect its implications and necessity for clinical practice, I am largely not interested in pursuing any part of that as a career. Since I've entered school I've always been interested in pursuing medical school but I've never committed to the thought, simply due to discounting my own ability, ambition, or financial means, but moving forward, it is increasingly becoming something that I feel would be a fantastic and possibly very viable option for my goals. I should note I took two years off after high school to figure out what I wanted and take some odd jobs before starting my undergraduate.

Now that I've given somewhat of a very brief and aesthetic view of where I'm at, I have a few questions as I've read through many of the posts here and it seems there's plenty of knowledgeable people to answer them. I'm already in my second year, going on my third year, and I haven't necessarily been planning for medical school. Is this okay? My GPA is okay at the moment, a 3.5 going up, I made a 3.75 last semester with a large class load. I can probably stabilize it around a 3.6 by the time I graduate. I will have research experience, probably two years or three years when I graduate, but my only other healthcare experience is a short-lived stint as a pharmaceutical technician earlier when I started school. There's two major hospitals nearby including one which I'm already with in the research, but I haven't really made use of them (Is shadowing actually worth it..?). What should I be doing? In general, what things should I take into account? Is there anything I should know?",,False,self,t5_2rlp9,1338936075.0,,,True,t3_umums,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/umums/looking_for_some_help/,

Anyways, I'm currently finishing up a degree in Psychology, finished my 4th and will be coming back for a 5th year part time to complete a couple of more courses (need 2 prereqs, and will take a couple of other courses perhaps). GPA wise, I'm okay. 2.8 first year, 3.8 second year, 3.9 in years 3 and 4, each being full course load. 

Through the 4 years, I had no idea what I really wanted to do, but I knew my interest lied somewhere in the realm of neuroscience. Now to me, this lead to potential careers such as med school (neurology/psychiatry), neuropsychology, or grad school in neuroscience. In the last year or so, I decided that I would like to apply to a MSc program in Neuroscience up here in Canada, but come 2012, I ran into the same problems of not knowing what I really wanted, there was always a feeling that I should try for med school. So I decided to shell out some money for a Kaplan prep course, bought some other material and will be taking the MCAT come August.

Here is what I see as the problem, my EC's/volunteer is strictly research with one proff. Nothing else. I mean I do other things, such as a lot of sports outside of school, play a few instruments etc, but only personal things, no institution or anything like that where I can say I volunteered at (like a hospital). No clubs, nothing. I don't bore you with details, but some personal issues stood in my way of really getting out there and getting social/volunteering/making connections, which I'm currently getting some help with.

Now, with my first MCAT coming up, something I feel I won't feel that I'll do well the first time, and no EC's, I feel that I won't be able to get into any med school even with a decent MCAT score for the year 2013.

I see myself with two options:

1) Don't apply to anything this upcoming fall, most likely rewrite the MCAT next year (maybe twice next year), and spend another year volunteering etc, to help with my resume, and apply in fall 2013 and if all goes right, get in for the year 2014, where I'll be 24.

2) Apply for a MSc Neuroscience, start that next year in 2013, and perhaps apply to Med school once again after that if I feel like a PhD isn't in my best interest. (my age during applying would be 25)

I think the biggest hurdle that comes with the lack of ECs is the idea of age. I know a few people who got into med school right after graduation (age 22), while I am coming back again to complete my undergrad, and a best scenario would be I get in at the age of 24...nothing wrong with that, but comparing myself to others has been a personal downfall for some time. Feel like garbage to be honest.

During my freshman year of college, I took physics and calculus. I received two B's (physics) and a B- (calculus). At the time I was not terribly concerned since the school I was at was notorious for not curving anything, and for giving low grades. Now, however, I've ruined several pairs of perfectly good trousers, when the memory has rushed upon me without warning.

Anyway, after my freshman year there, I transferred to NYU, and have received good grades from my sophomore year until now (having a science GPA at nyu of 3.5944, an overall GPA of 3.761, and a major GPA of 3.9). However, adding in the grades from my freshman year, all of my numbers drop. I'm most concerned about my science GPA, which drops to a 3.42--well below the average accepted science GPA for matriculated students of my ethnic background (white). 

Other factors: I have spent a year volunteering at a hospital, interacting with patients there. After that, I spent half a year doing clinical research (where I even got to be the coauthor of a paper currently under review, YAY!), and have been doing laboratory research in neuroscience for the past year (logging over 600 hours so far). I'm taking my MCAT on the 31st of May, and have been doing alright on the practice tests, though not as well as I'd like, naturally. I've also taken and received an A in a programming class (introduction to programming, with Python as the language used), which I understand some medical schools count into the math/science average, and some don't.

I recently graduated from university with a bachelors degree in engineering (back in November). unfortunately I graduated with a B- average (a 2.7 on a 4.0 scale). this was due to a couple factors:

* I found it hard to transition from high school to university in my first year
* I was not really motivated to do exceptionally well

my first year was a disaster. I averaged a 2.5 (C+) because I found it really hard to go from high school to university. as I went onto 2nd, 3rd and 4th year, my grades got better (I averaged a 3.4 in 4th year).

I'm really interested in becoming a MD, but I'm really discouraged because of my grades. I currently live in **Canada**, and the only med school in my province is UBC. according to their [""grade conversion tables""](http://www.med.ubc.ca/__shared/assets/Grade_Conversion_Table21093.pdf), I have a 70% average. I still have to go back and do my pre-reqs for med school. assuming I do that (also assuming I do somewhat well in those courses), and I do a couple of elective courses, I can bump up my GPA to around a B average (which is 74% in their conversion tables).

now moving on to my MCAT. if I do really well on it (assuming I get somewhere in the mid-upper 30's), it gives me somewhat of a good chance of at least being able to apply to their medical school. I also have the ability to apply to medical schools in the province over (Alberta), and they have different admission requirements but not as strict as UBC's.

I can't talk to anyone else about this, my parents don't understand (my mom never went to college and my dad is an old school doctor who's simple answer is to ""try harder""), I'm really too embarrassed to go to my friends, and my premed department isn't very vocal on any issues.

I'm currently a sophomore at a very competitive college (top-30) and I'm starting to see my future collapse around me. I've always wanted to be a doctor, science classes are the only classes that I love and the only thing that I'm interested in. It's not my desire that's stopping me or even my extra curriculars (I'm currently an EMT in my college's EMS group, looking for an officer position. I've also done community service with some big groups on campus, may go on a service trip by the end of my time here, probably going abroad this summer, and can get a research position if I want somewhere in my bio department). Like everyone else that's in hot water, it's my GPA that's holding me back.

The problem started right off the bat freshman year. Looking back, I should have put more work in but I wasn't slacking off in any way, I just got consistent B's, and B+'s in my science classes, and when you throw in a C 2 semesters for spanish (a requirement) and you get my GPA after my first year of being 3.079 with a 3.092 science GPA. Now at this point, I'm upset but not overly worried. I've heard of first year slumps and I wasn't too concerned. It's this semester that's really hit me hard.

I came into this semester determined to work harder than I've ever had, and I did. I worked my ass off in every single one of my classes, and I really thought that I could see the results. I cruised through my humanities and was really beating curves in my science classes. I really have zero regrets about my work ethic for this semester. However, come grades, I got an inexplicable B- in orgo, and B+ in my lab, and a B in my cell bio class (the B- and B are what both of those classes are curved to). I honestly was expecting at least a grade higher in each class with how high I was above the curve on many of the tests (9, 10, 13 points on many occasions). I got A's in my non-science classes, leaving me at the end of this semester with a 3.204 GPA and a 3.040 science GPA.

This is why I'm feeling so lost. I put SO much work in this semester and got nothing for it. I feel like my grades on tests improve each semester but I have no final grades to show for it. Time is running out, and I know it. I'm taking 3 science classes next semester and underloading, and I've calculated that if I get an A in one and 2 A-'s, with an A in my orgo lab then I'll have a 3.258 science GPA. Is that even realistic though? If I worked as hard as I did last semester and could only manage what I got, how can I expect A's ever? I've lost every ounce of confidence in my body, and I just feel like I never get the grades I expect.

So I guess I just want an unbiased opinion. If you think that I can't make this up, then tell me. If you think that I should start considering other options, then tell me. I just want to know if I can even do this.

I started off unlike many premeds, I originally wanted to go into architecture. I had the misfortune or fortune of graduating high school as the housing bubble burst, at this time I was already having second thoughts about architecture and had fallen in love with my AP Bio and AP Chem classes. So I started college as a biochemistry/molecular biology major intending to go the PhD route and do research. Alas I didn't first summer of research I realized while yes I do enjoy it, I hate the lack of human interaction. I searched around for other options until I accidentally ended up helping a family friend out at a free clinic he runs. When I decided to become a ""pre-med"" (I hate that word), I was freaking out all the other premeds have plans for their lives, and all this other stuff. After a few months it hit me:

**IT DOESN'T MATTER**

Take life one step at a time, enjoy the flowers. Screw everyone that will step over people to get to their goals. I've found it infinitely more rewarding to learn for the sake of learning, not for the sake of getting into medical school. I take classes I want to take and learn about rather than classes that are easy because they'll make me look good on paper. I help people out, I tutor, I don't feel any need to be a ""gunner"".

If someone had told me this before I started, I wouldn't have wasted a few months of my life having the traditional pre-med mentality. That's honestly why I started [Pre-Med Hell](http://www.premedhell.com/) to dispel that myth and to get people to breakaway from that mold.

This is my first time posting on this subreddit, but I've been lurking for quite a while. 

So here's my situation: 

I am a rising junior, and so far I'm doing very well in my classes  (Straight A's except for one ""B"" in Physics II. GPA is like 3.92 or something) and have finished all my pre-reqs. My ECs are decent, I have shadowing hours, but no clinical experience yet, and I haven't taken the MCAT yet. 

So the dilemma I'm facing is I don't know whether I should take the MCAT in the spring or fall of 2014. This decision is made even more complex because I know the format will change in 2015. The way I see it, here are the advantages of each choice: 

**Spring**

Advantages: 

* If I do badly, I can retake it again in the summer or fall without having to take the new format of the test. 

* The pre-reqs will be a little bit fresher in my mind. 

* Won't have to apply later in the cycle and/or take a gap year. 

Disadvantage: 

* Will have to study for the MCAT while juggling school (though my course load will be kept light if I do this.)

* Can't use this time to get clinical hours

**Summer**

Advantages: 

*Will have 3 months of undivided attention to study for the MCAT

Disadvantages: 

*Only have one chance to do well

*Might have to apply later in the cycle

Last time I checked, we still are going to be doctors, we still have to work as hard as our counter parts, and some day no one is going to give s**t about those letters. I have seen more MD students replying to complaints and listing the pros about osteopathic medicine. If you are a OMS and you are bitching about ""BOO HOO OMT SUCKS ITS PSEUDOSCIENCE,"" please stfu. You learn OMT deal with it, open your mind, it's an extra tool we learn that other people don't get too, in fact, more MDs are trying to learn it to now. Pseudoscience or not stop bitching about being an Osteopathic medical student. No one gives a shit you have to take two boards, no one gives a shit about what you think about OMT, or how bad your rotation sites ""might be."" You're a big kid now, pick your own quality rotations do your research. Whatever your reason was to go to an osteopathic school (be honest with yourself) bad mcat, low gpa, actually liked the idea of the osteopathic philosophy, no one wants to hear your complaining, you are here now, you will be a doctor. You don't go to an MD school BOO HOO HOO. We do the same shit MD's do, in fact you couldn't tell a DO from an MD if you didnt see their name badge.

I have a fair amount of employment experience during the summer months within fields such as forestry, environmental conservation as well as teaching that I can speak of during the interview, but I really feel that I need more volunteer experience to stand out which I think will be difficult to acquire during a master's degree.

By life skills I mean things like the fact that I have been living on my own and sustaining myself while attending school.  A few peers of mine recently got admitted to various med schools and (nothing against them they deserve it) it seems like a few of them have absolutely zero life experience.  That is they have lived at home for there entire undergrad career, never worked a job they actually needed so they could pay rent, a few don't even regularly make their own meals.  Aside from the fact that they have more time to study because they aren't dealing with life stuff, most of them are very naive about the world.   Along with this I can tell that the things they think about in a day are so much different than someone who has to consider all the daily chores they have to do to key their life together, bills to pay etc....

As someone who sees them as both friends and competition for med school places I find it frustrating that they are able to maintain higher GPAs and do more ""good"" EC's because they aren't busting their asses to make enough for rent next month.  

Now its not like my experience is extreme, that is, I don't have 2 kids running around that need feeding, so it seems like putting general life skills on an application is so mundane.

My original studying plan was as follows: 

I was enrolled in an MCAT course that reviewed all the material on the exam, I attended all the classes but didn't do much of my own studying outside of that. The class ended about a week and a half ago, at which point I was planning on spending the last 3 weeks of July going through the various topics in my MCAt exam books and writing out my own notes in a high amount of detail, this would help me study and give me notes I could quickly refer to. 

Then come the first of August I was planning on doing just study questions, I have about 4000 stand lane questions spanning the various topics as well as access to all the AAMC practice exams.

Today is July 16th and I'm finding that I am not summarizing all these topics in quick enough of a fashion, it took me an entire week to write out notes on all the topics in physics and I'm just starting the general chemistry topics, after which I'll still have organic chemistry and all the biology related topics to summarize. Simply put I don't think I'll have all of them done in time for my August 1st deadline. 

Can someone offer some input as to whether or not I should restructure my study plan and if so, how they would do so. 

Should I forget writing out notes and just read from the textbook between now and August 1st? Should I continue to write out my own notes even if it means pushing my deadline back a week to August 8th? Are 27 days worth of doing practice questions enough time in order to be fully prepared for the MCAT? My goal is to get around a 37, but right now I'm not scoring too well since I don't do very many practice questions, I just read the textbooks.

I ended up pursuing a PhD because of various reasons at the time and it was also simply the path of least resistance for me... I made a huge mistake. To make a long story short I was miserable with my career direction and decided to leave. Now, I am trying to figure out what I should do and medical school still sounds very appealing to me (I am interested in ophthalmology) but I had a few questions.

First, my background and stats. As an undergrad I double majored in chemistry and chemical engineering from a very competitive top 10 engr university, so my GPA suffered as a result (3.16 cumulative, major specific GPAs are 3.20 and 3.35 respectively though). I have all my med pre-reqs in order except a year of biology and lab. Because of my fairly low GPA and the fact that I am missing the biology credits, I am thinking of doing a post-bacc somewhere. What are your thoughts regarding this? I have also not started to study for the MCAT, but I will shortly. I am reasonably good at standardized exams and scored a 1440 on my GRE when I was applying to PhD programs if that matters (maybe some post-bacc programs will accept a GRE score?). I have about 1.5 years of research experience (6 months of which was full time), but do not have any shadowing experience (yes I know this is extremely important and I'm working on it).

I guess my main question is: do I stand any shot at acceptance without doing the post-bacc program? Am I also a good candidate for doing a post-bacc? Will I be readily accepted into a post-bacc program is what I am mainly wondering. Anyway, any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated!

And don't get me wrong, it's fun hanging out all day in the ED; the medical staff are pretty much all bright, thoughtful, nice people, and the cases can be very interesting to observe.

Anyway, everything else about the job is terrible.

I've been forced to sign documents, acknowledging having been warned verbally and in writing that I had broken rules before and have since repeated to do so--when I was never informed of having broken rules in the first place, especially never verbally. In most instances, these were things I'd done directly mimicking my trainer (breaking the rules themself without telling me not to follow suit) or things that the doctors had directly told me to do and, yes, that that it's okay, yes, I should do that. I wrote my responses on the back of this paper, which I was required to sign even after stating I was not actually informed I'd done anything wrong in the first place (although I was cited repeatedly for the same things on multiple dates). When my ""project supervisor"" saw I'd written responses/rebuttals, they threw out the original, copied bastardization/modification of the citations (misquoting me and saying I'd said other people said things they hadn't said, which I hadn't claimed they'd said--so now it would seem I lied if anyone ever asked one of these third parties), and made me sign that same form with the new BS/lies worked into the citations. All of that came with a warning that I'd be fired the next time I make a mistake or call out sick. Cool. . .

Then I get my first paycheck since opting for 40-hour work weeks. We service two areas of the same ED: Adult and Peds. Most of the time, I work in the Adult ED. At least once or twice per week, I'm scheduled in the Peds ED. And do you know why? Because if I work 24 hours per pay period in Peds, 56 hours per pay period in Adult. . . I must work either 24 hours more in Adult, or 56 hours more in Peds, before I am able to earn a penny of overtime on the hours that follow. So I worked 24 hours of overtime in one pay period. . . except by Scribe America standards, I actually worked zero hours of overtime. Fuck me, right? Clearly, working 10 eight-hour days Adult and 3 eight-hour days in Peds in a 15-day pay period is not working hard enough to earn OT for any of those extra 24 hours, at all. 104 hours worked. At a regular wage of $10/hr. Sorry, deposit+rent, public utilities and student loans. . . can't pay you all this month.

You guys are usually great at helping out all of us in the applying phase, and I could use your expertise now.

My cGPA is 3.85, my sGPA is 3.74.

Good ECs, with 2 years of research, over 200+ hours of shadowing at 4 different hospitals, with ~100 volunteering at a clinic for those without medical insurance, and Habitat for Humanity.  Also, a million hours in marching band, jazz band, and almost 300 as part of Kappa Kappa Psi service fraternity.

I scored a 27 on the MCAT, however.

My questions are kind of Texas-based.  I have my brother, who is at UTMB, asking around, but you guys could help too.  For Texas schools with rolling admission, is it advisable to apply early now, with what I have, or wait until I take the MCAT again on **July 13,** and then apply with that information?  How exactly would they receive and view another MCAT score, released in the middle of August?

I also plan on applying with AMCAS after that July 13 test date.

If you guys would be willing to assist me, I would be incredibly thankful!

Undergraduate:
I went to a *very* small Christian college in CA for my Freshman, Sophomore, and Senior years. My junior year, I decided I would try to go to a state school (because private schools are expensive) and went to a UC. While there, I was entirely unable to focus and tanked horribly in classes. I found out the reason why is because I have severe ADD, and my lack of support structure, familiar areas, and pharmacological assistance didn't help me to do all that I could. 

The summer between Jr and Sr year, I went to a psych and got diagnosed and medicated. When I returned to the private school, I was taking 18 units of upper division classes (mostly sciences), working in a lab doing research, teaching 2 upper division bio labs, and working a part time job related to my research. The 2nd semester I continued to work the part time job, and raised money so that I could go overseas to volunteer a chunk of my summer working in clinics serving people who have no access to medicine. 

My dilemma is that my last year is the snapshot of the decent med school applicant I truly am, and the rest of my academic career doesn't reflect that due to my insanely bad ADD. I want to work to improve my chances at getting into medical school, and I know that unless I score incredibly high on the MCAT I have no shot at getting into medical school this cycle. 

Grades are as follows:

Freshman yr: 3.5, 3.0

Sophomore yr: 3.72, 3.47

Junior year: *cant remember pw, GPAs were ~ 2.7-2.9*

Senior yr: 3.88, 4.0

cGPA: 3.32

sGPA: ~3.3-ish 

My question is: what programs should I be applying to? which SMPs or Post Baccs would be best for me? While at the UC, I did not do well in physics or biochem/cell bio.

I have a 3.6 GPA and I'm making A's in my current Anatomy and Physiology coursework. I'm not too worried about the MCAT, since I've always done well on big tests like that, ex: LSAT, ACT, etc. I know that I need more math classes and chemistry as well. Can these be taken at a community college? Should I go to paramedic school? Should I look for a job in a lab?

Give me ideas to do things in my spare time productive to my med school application!,hypnofed,5,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1e41hq/i_have_a_long_layover_before_applying_to_medical/,"So here's my backstory.  Four year ago I was laid off from a shitty job I hated.  I had wanted to go to med school when I finished my BS but I was nowhere near qualified- shitty GPA, unprepared to take the MCAT, and my pre-reqs weren't done (undergrad was a miserable, nightmarish experience).  But I decided to say screw the long odds- if I don't pursue my dreams, I'm going to end up with a life of regret and mediocrity.

Through some skill and lucky breaks (my overall GRE score was 99.9th %ile), I got into a good MS program and am now writing my thesis.  I've been admitted to a PhD program at Tulane (Parasitology and Tropical Medicine) with full financial support and start in the Fall.  I wanted to do a combined MD/DO and PhD program, but decided against it for a few reasons- the fact that I'm more interested in DO programs and that there simply aren't a lot of schools with both osteopathic and graduate schools was pretty much the nail in the coffin.  The rough plan at this point in time is to do my PhD, take a year at the end to finish my pre-requisites (they're not finished, and the ones I did take will be 10-15 years old by then), take the MCAT, and apply to med school.

In the meantime, what I want to do is take advantage of any opportunity that I can to strengthen my application.  So, here's my situation.  For about 5 years, I'll be working on my PhD full time at a well-respected SPH.  Despite being a SPH, my program is actually very bench-science oriented.  I'm in contact with a church of my denomination (UU) and a Kiwanis Club I plan to join once I get to the New Orleans, so I don't have any concerns about community involvement.  I've thought about seeing if I can find a way to shadow a physician, but I have no idea how to go about finding that or arranging it.  I'm aware I need a recommendation from a DO for osteopathic school, though.  I've worked with plenty of MDs in research, but no DOs.  Seems that DOs don't work outside of patient care as often as MDs.

For my background:  BS Biology, MS Biomedical Science.  Undergrad GPA sucks- 2.49 as per AMCAS, will be higher with AACOMAS due to a significant number of retakes but I haven't done that calculation.  Grad GPA of 3.63 is much more indicative of my abilities.  I haven't taken the MCAT, but I've never taken a standardized test and not scored in the 99th percentile.  I'm also a former educator and have worked in exam prep.
