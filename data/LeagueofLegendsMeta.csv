First of all i wanna point out that english isn't my native, so, please, don't go full rage, if you don't understand something ;). Also, main goal of this post isn't discussion, but just sharing of my calculations, that i made for myself.

I am maining Fizz almost half and year, and almost every pvp game, that i play with him, i ask myself: what should i build to win my lane? to win the game? And today i suddenly decided to make some calculations of Fizz's total magical damage from specific combo with various core builds. So, let's begin...

Calculations doesn't count physical damage, doesn't count masteries Havoc/Executioner, doesn't count W DoT % Damage. Fizz's level is considered 18th, ""specific"" combo is considered R-&gt;W-&gt;Q-&gt;AA-&gt;E-&gt;AA + 2 Lichbane Procs (1st on Q, 2nd on AA after E) + 6 Sec of W DoT (3 - for applying combo, 3 - after you disengage from your target). I listed 6 core builds, and each have Lichbane at start, cause i think everybody will agree with me, that Lichbane for Fizz is a mandatory. You may not build Lichbane first (if you max W 1st, E 2nd, and buy Deathcap as 1st big item, then you will be able to kill caster minions in one lvl3 E), but certanly you will build it second.

**Fizz's Skills/Lichbane base damage + AP ratios:**

* Lichbane: 50 + 75% AP
* Q: 130 + 60% AP
* W: 70 + 35% AP / 30 + 35% AP

* 7. 50 x 0.92 x 0.65 - 5.5 = 24 MR or 81% Magical Damage *taken* or **[2510 DMG for 7620 Gold]**

**II) Target 3000 HP 100 MR:**

* 1. 100 x 0.92 - 20.5 = 72 MR or 58% Magical Damage *taken* or **[1973 DMG for 7800 Gold]**
* 2. 100 x 0.92 - 20.5 = 72 MR or 58% Magical Damage *taken* or **[2265 DMG for 7600 Gold]**

* 4. 80 x 0.92 - 20.5 = 53 MR or 65% Magical Damage *taken* or **[1856 DMG for 7920 Gold]**
* 5. 80 x 0.92 - 5.5 = 68 MR or 60% Magical Damage *taken* or **[1859 DMG for 7885 Gold]**
* 6. 80 x 0.92 - 5.5 = 68 MR or 60% Magical Damage *taken* or **[1695 DMG for 7445 Gold]**
* 7. 100 * 0.92 * 0.65 - 5.5 = 54 MR or 65% Magical Damage *taken* or **[2014 DMG for 7620 Gold]**

**Conclusions i made:**

* 1. Never build DFG, if you are not behind, cause it provides insane damage to only one target. Without DFG's active Fizz's total magical damage with full combo is equal to 3rd/""Zhonya's"" core build, which have the lowest total damage among all 6 builds. DFG worth it, when you are behind and don't have enough damage to carry your team, but with DFG you can assasinate some valuable enemy target like ADC or APC.
* 2. If you are ahead and don't need any armor/mr that much, then go for 1st/""Deathcap"" core build, cause it provides 2nd the highest dmg output after 3rd/""Zhonya's"" among all 6 builds.
* 3. If you are having problems with physical damage at laning phase (heavy AD mid/top), don't go straight for Zhonya's Hourglass. Instead go for 6th core build, cause it provides same magical damage for less gold, also it gives you 45 extra MR, that may be useful later in teamfights. And also you can anytime upgrade your Boots to Sorc for 775 gold and get extra MPen or upgrade them earlier to Tabi for extra Armor in laning phase.
* 4. If you are having problems with magical damage at laning phase (heavy AP mid/top) or just don't want to risk going reckless for Deathcap, then go for 5th core build. It provides same damage as 4th/""Abyssal"" build, but for a bit less gold, and also allows you to upgrade your Boots to Sorc for extra MPen or to Merc for extra MR + Tenacity anytime you want. And also dat Needlessly Large Rod is core item for Deathcap/Zhonya's/DFG, so overall i would call 5th core build as a very flexible golden mean.
* 5. Sorc.Boots and Tier-2.Boots overall aren't mandatory anymore, if you build Lichbane as 1st big item. For penetration you can get any other big item like Abyssal/Void or even Liandry's, if you like it on Fizz.

**TL;DR:** Begone, heretic! I spent 3.5 hours writing and formating my post not for this section!

**Update:** Added 7th core build with Tier-1.Boots/Lichbane/Void.Staff/Needlessly.Rod/Doran's. According to ""Shooting Range"", this build is valuable if your targets have more than 100 MR - at 100 MR it deal slightly more damage than 1st core build for slightly less gold cost. Also at 100 MR 2nd core build is still on top by damage output to one target.

I'd recommend going for Void Staff, only if whole enemy team have 100+ MR after you finished Lichbane (actually, such situation is nearly impossible, enemy team certanly will be trolling, stacking MR against you :D). IMO, better way get Void Staff is go this way: Doran's Ring -&gt; Tier-1.Boots -&gt; Lichbane -&gt; Deathcap -&gt; Void Staff -&gt; Sorc.Boots

1348851700.0,119,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,10mjww,Why do you try to play 1200 elo like a tournament?,awjustaguy,139,20,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/10mjww/why_do_you_try_to_play_1200_elo_like_a_tournament/,"Let's go ahead and get this out of the way: I think EVERYONE believes that they are a bit better than their elo. As such, people will try to play like the elo that they believe themselves to be in. In addition, many people will look at the pros and tournament builds and try to copy that playstyle.

Here's my thought though: Playing like a high-elo player is not always the right choice. Let me give you a personal example first, and I know that it's not evidence of anything, but I want to share an experience with you.

I've always considered myself a decent player. Who hasn't? I always felt 'stuck' at around 1100-1300 elo and I always felt 'better' than my team. Eventually, I managed to crawl my way up to about 1350, and then I experienced something strange: I started winning ALL. THE. TIME. I felt like I could have no wrong. All the things I had been doing wrong were suddenly right. I jumped about 200 elo in a few weeks.

What happened? As I considered it, I realized something important. When I was playing in 1100-1200 elo, I was playing like a 1400 player. However, 1200 elo is a different ball-game; the strategies and team mechanics are very different than 1400. I wouldn't ward often because I expected the support and jungler to pick up ward slack. I would make harmful trades to bait a jungle gank that never came from my jungler. I would push cautiously wary of a gank top when all of a sudden there were five bot.

When I got to around 1350 elo, people started playing more the way I expected them to play, and I was able to succeed more.

So here are my final thoughts: Playing beyond your ELO is a bad move. Expecting your teammates and enemies to be 2300 players is just as bad for your game as not warding and pushing hard. The first step to conquering your ELO is understanding the mindset of your elo. With the knowledge that I have now, I would have gone support more often in 1200, because I think the main type of player in that level are players that ARE good but they try to be super stars; being a good teammate fits with their style and helps you secure the win.

1370036181.0,115,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1ffgv4,A Game of Pressure: This isn't Call of Duty,BlueNoseReindeer,137,22,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1ffgv4/a_game_of_pressure_this_isnt_call_of_duty/,"Hi guys, here's today's article. Let me know in the comments if you would want me to create a blog where I post these, I will keep using reddit either way.

A common mistake that I see even as a Platinum player is the inability to create genuine pressure (let's say that pressure is defined as your ability to control your opponent). To win League you need to kill the enemy team's nexus, not the necessarily the enemy team, and that means being able to take their turrets and inhibitors. Since they want to defend these, you must ""pressure"" them away from them.

With that being said, kills are often both a good way to create pressure, and an indicator of which team has more. This is why the team with the most kills usually wins, but not always. 

If you have pressure, you can get kills, take towers, kill dragon/baron, get inhibs, etc. because they can't stop you for whatever reason. Now, let's take a look at what some of those reasons are.

* Raw Power. Draven-Leona is the most powerful starting bot lane I can think of, and they create pressure just by existing. Why? Because any fight that they start they are almost guaranteed to win due to their burst/CC combo. Their early power allows them to position themselves wherever they want easily, allowing them to zone from cs, push towers, etc. They don't necessarily need to get kills to be effective, the threat of being able to kill is good enough. In a straight up fight with no turrets and equal minion damage, Draven-Leona will beat everything. Beating a Draven-Leona combo requires poking/kiting, lowering the amount of power they have to the point where they CAN be beaten in a fight (for more on team comps read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fa711/composition_analysis_next_level_solo_queing/).  Always remember (particularly at earlier stages of the game) that minion damage is factored into raw power, both in the jungle and the lane. A team with more raw power that maneuvers effectively (which is the trick) can safe take towers, dragons, and Barons, because they are favored to win fights. Understanding match ups (who counters who and why), as well as scaling, combined with the state of the game (what items, level, %HP/Mana, and buffs both you and they have) allow you to calculate everyone's raw power. As a side note, items are always more accurate in determining raw power than gold. A Kha'Zix with 5 kills isn't as scary as you think if he's bought 5 Fortitude Elixers.

* Wards. Wards create pressure if you use them correctly. Leona has bush control? Put a ward in (not next to her or she'll kill it) and for 3 minutes that bush is as much yours as hers. But then she pinks it, giving her control of the bush again, allowing her to zone you from the bush, *controlling where you go*, AKA creating pressure. Vision gives knowledge, and knowledge is power. Remember last paragraph When I talked about maneuvering properly? Wards allow you to do that by seeing what your enemy is doing, and what you need to do in response. More commonly, wards serve as anti-pressure, denying the enemy's ability to control you, so that in the end you can have more net pressure.

* Minion waves. Minions waves are a big part of why split pushers are viable in LoL. Take Singed for example, if League were about getting kills Singed would be a terrible champion. Because of his ability to destroy enemy minion waves, making his own bigger, he is able to splitpush, creating pressure. Because of this pressure the enemy goes to react, and will usually try to fight him, resulting in a chase, which is the only reason he can pick up kills. If Singed is able to draw more than one person to him, the rest of his team has a clear advantage, and can take objectives elsewhere. Setting up a massive minion wave, then moving to the opposite side of the map and pushing there has a similar effect. The enemy team must either send someone to deal with this wave and seriously risk losing a tower, or give up a tower to the minion wave. Pressure created, no kills required.

* Cooldowns. Cooldowns are essential to determining real Raw Power, not just potential Raw Power. In lane when Blitzcrank misses a hook you have at least 10 seconds to harass him where he can do nothing about it (closer to 15 at L1), because his Raw Power has dropped dramatically. This is why knowing/timing cooldowns (especially major ones, such as Shen and Karthus ults) is so important. If you are able to force/bait out an ultimate, your engage will be stronger than theirs, and you should use this to your advantage.
tl;dr Cooldowns of abilities are factors people overlook more than just about anything else. Take this into account when determining Raw Power to make a play.

* Jungler. Jungle pressure is something you probably hear a lot about, because it is the most significant early pressure that a team can exert, because it is the biggest hunk of Raw Power they can move about the map to make plays. A gank ultimately means a 3v2 or 2v1, and will almost always result in more Raw power for the ganker, which can result in kills or forcing someone out of lane. This type of pressure is designed to ""snowball"" a lane. What that means is that if the gank is successful, their is still work left to be done. After being given an advantage, the laner should (at least temporarily) have more Raw Power, and be able to create pressure for the team in their lane by 1: drawing enemy jungle pressure (and not falling to it) so that they cannot make plays on other lanes 2: taking the tower to give global gold/exp and increased roaming opportunities so that you can pressure other lanes 3: deny farm in order to reduce the amount of Raw Power that the enemy will have.

* Kills. Kills are a great way to set yourself ahead, and your opponent back, but during the laning phase if you recall at the wrong point in the creep wave progression you can make the kills meaningless and even a setback. Level stats are extremely important early on, and missing the experience from a couple waves may give the opportunity for the enemy to have more Raw Power than the longsword/amp tome that you just bought gave you. It's very important to distinguish between lategame kills, and early game kills. Early game kills can lead to snowballing, but if they don't, are relatively insignificant. Late game kills can lead to losing objectives, but if they don't, are similarly insignificant. As such, your mindset should be such that if you get kills in lane, you are looking to get yourself ahead and/or set the enemy back because this is how you create pressure. If you get kills after the laning phase, you want to take an objective because this is how you create pressure. If you think a game will run long, dragon&gt;tower; if you think a game will be short tower&gt;dragon.

* Most Net Pressure. As several of the previous paragraphs (the last one in particular) have alluded to, you need to factor in not just how much pressure you are applying, but what the enemy is doing in response. It doesn't matter if you are able to take the first two towers on Bot and Mid if Tryndamere has taken down top lane to the Nexus turrets. The end goal of pressuring objectives is to kill their Nexus before they kill yours. Keep this in mind when deciding when you need to stop pushing (or taking a Baron) to deal with enemy pressure.

(I'm sure I'm not including everything, feel free to suggest other things, which I may add to the list)

League is an objective-oriented game, and if you want to win you need to have an objective-oriented mindset. Taking into consideration both your composition, and the enemy team's, and applying pressure to objectives as best you can given those compositions (i.e. grouping as an AOE comp, splitpushing as a splitpush comp, etc.) is how you win games.

So I set out to do some math. I decided that the best way to solve this was the calculate the damage per health of the two rock beasts. Much like team fighting, you want to your team's damage to most efficiently take out the other team's damage. The highest damage/effectiveHealth would be the ADC, in other words the guy with the highest Damage and the lowest health.

I will calculate the damage/health based on the golem's stats between 3:00 and 3:59. Since the armor and magic resistance of the two are the same (buff camps are an exception), I will not take that into account effective physical health or effective magical health as they will take equal amount of damage from the same attack. In this case, pairing resistance with more health does not affect our calculations. Big monsters and their respective little monsters have the same attack speed too.

Big Golem: 

Health= 1200 + 48(3) = 1344

Damage= 54 + 1.6(3) = 58.8

Damage/Health= **0.04375**

Lesser Golem: 

Health= 300 + 37(3) = 411

Damage= 30 + 1.3(3) = 33.9

Damage/Health= **0.08248**

**Conclusion:**

The Lesser Golem's Damage/Health ratio is 89% higher than that of the Big Golem, meaning that it is much preferred to use damage on the Lesser Golem than the Big Golem, assuming single target damage only.

[8 games, 8 wins](http://i.imgur.com/GzILWyp.png) (not pictured: 2 more ranked AP Skarner wins pushed off the bottom of the history)

I had a lot of fun with AP Tryn during his brief reign as the king of top lane, so as soon as they announced his nerfs I started looking for an alternative. Specifically, I really liked the CDR boots &gt; Nashors build in conjunction with a CDR-on-autoattack mechanic to push your ability cooldowns to ridiculously low levels. AP Skarner fits this role more holistically than Tryn does as he doesn't need to work around Bloodlust and crits, and all of his abilities reduce on hit AND have their own AP ratios.

**PROS TO AP SKARNER**:  

Obscene waveclear  
Godlike sustained damage  
A heal and a shield that both scale with AP  
Dat incredible ult with the added bonus of a 1.0 ratio and a ridiculously low effective cooldown(even after the nerf it's still a gamechanger)  
Melts turrets, especially with sheen or lichbane  
Permaslow from lvl 1--extremely hard to disengage from and very easy to gank for (especially after 6)  
Stupidly high scaling into midgame and beyond  
Throws off enemy counterpicks in draft due to being unconventional  
You **will** catch most players completely off guard with the amount of damage and sustain you can throw around  
Incredibly fun to play!

**CONS TO AP SKARNER:**  

Squishy and easy to burst in teamfight situations--therefore not a reliable initiator the way tank Skarner is  
No gap closer, low range, vulnerable to being kited, has a very hard time with some ranged lanes  
Takes a long time to recover from a slow start  
Fairly easy to gank, only has W as an escape tool and if the shield gets bursted he's a sitting duck  
Can be zoned from utilizing his heal in lane and teamfights  
Naturally pushes lane with harass, vulnerable to freezing in a losing lane  
Desperately mana-hungry  
May break your QWE keys from intensive button mashing

**MASTERIES:**

AP SKAR should be my active mastery page [on my lolking](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/151476#masteries). 21/0/9 modified AP page. I'm not particularly confident in this page the way I usually am when it comes to masteries; arguments could be made for taking Havoc (%dmg) or Deadliness/Weapons Expertise (ad/lvl and %arpen) instead of fury (aspd) due to its low budget. Even though you can certainly utilize the aspd, you're autoattacking in order to cast more spells and whether 4% is enough to net you another Q (or anything) in any given scenario is really hard to say. I go into utility instead of defense because that manareg is crucial throughout the game and I often try to steal buffs (or take blue when nobody else can better use it) when the lane is pushed but I can't pressure the tower. AP Skar is one of the few champions where I don't feel like my squishiness is enough of a liability to warrant going deep into defense, due to my heal and shield and how your goal in a trade is really to force the other player to try to retreat with your overwhelming damage output so you can put even more hurt on them with your permaslow. I'd love to get some more opinions on this~

**RUNES**:

Hybrid Penetration Reds/Armor Yellows/MR Blues/AP Quints

If you do not own hybrid pen reds (because let's face it, that shit's expensive, even if it is great), consider magic pen (generic AP page) or aspd. I haven't tried these so I can't vouch for how they feel. Because of the hybrid ratio on Q and how much autoattacking you do, hybrid pen is pretty much always going to be the best choice for raw damage output.

**SUMMONERS:**

Flash is, of course, mandatory. I tend to take ignite as my second summoner because if you can snowball the lane off a kill or two you're pretty much set. Besides that, I'd consider taking barrier (or in rare cases, cleanse) if you're against a heavy ganking jungler or lane bully that's going to try to all-in for a kill on you early themselves (Elise and Jayce are pretty much nightmares for AP Skarner). Exhaust is redundant; you already have a permaslow and a suppress. Ghost certainly could be useful but it would be situational against extremely high mobility teams.

**ABILITIES:**

Q should pretty much always be your starting spell. You can steal wraiths with it at level 1 or put significant damage out for your jungler or wait in the top lane bush (when you're on purple side) to catch the other laner if they helped with blue buff--as long as they aren't strong enough to turn it around on you lvl 1. You're pretty weak relative to the top lane paradigm early on so don't try to catch out a GP or Kayle and expect things to go well for you.

I generally go QEQW to harass my opponent in lane and slowly try to shove him under tower with the damage from Q and E, taking advantage of E's sustain at the same time. You could consider taking W at lvl 2 or 3 if you either suspect a gank or your own jungler is ganking and you need the extra stickiness to stay in range and keep the slow up.

After that, R &gt; Q &gt; E &gt; W in almost all cases. The only time I will max E first is if I'm being zoned by a ranged laner and desperately need the extra heal and waveclear. Leveling Q gets you more damage and a MUCH stronger slow--so only max E when you are behind and want to avoid aggressive trades as much as possible.

**ITEMS:**

I start **flask/3pots** or **flask/pot/ward** almost every game. His heal is quite weak early and being a short ranged fighter, he's always going to need more sustain. As well, CDRner is -ridiculously- mana-hungry. I won't get into the math for this miniguide but you're looking at something around 3x as many spellcasts as a no-CDR Skarner with moderate aspd. Specifically, I really like flask because it rounds out Skarner's early weaknesses well--he's only strong if you're going all-in and autoattacking, but you need lots of HP and mana to keep that up. By going hard early and chugging flask to keep yourself on top, you should be able to get an advantage or at least survive long enough for your first major purchase. If you aren't a fan of flask, you can try a 9pot/2ward setup with mixed HP and mana pots, or boots/3 against champions that might be difficult to get in range against.

**Tear of the Goddess** is my first core item that I build every single game. Skarner's Q was -made- for charging tear, with a low mana cost, no target requirements, and a base CD of 3.5 seconds. Spam Q in the fountain and on the way to lane and you'll find that you can charge your tear easily before 20 minutes as long as you bought it reasonably early. Skarner's a huge black hole of mana if you spam indiscriminately (which is half the fun of AP skarner, let's be honest) but I find that a rushed tear and flask are all I need to manage my mana throughout the entire game. Later, you're going to be turning this into **Archangel's Staff/Seraph's Embrace**, giving you a boatload of cost-efficient AP and a very powerful shield active that helps counteract your squishiness and pull off ridiculous low-hp sustain baits (you can use WE in the middle of a fight for a shield and heal, pop Seraph's for a second shield, and by the time it's down your shield will be back up and you can have healed twice).

Now for the part the AP Tryn fans have been waiting for: With your mana issues settled for the measly price of 1045g, it's time to cap your CDR and get a nice chunk of AP and Aspd with **Ionian Boots of Lucidity and Nashor's Tooth**. I tend to get boots1 + codex if I can afford to first, or straight-up CDR boots if I'm short, or just a codex if I'm short of that too. The daggers into Stinger into Nashor's come last.

Once you hit that magic 39% CDR, you can weave Qs in between almost every auto attack and bring the effective cooldowns of your other spells to around 1/3 of their base value (dependent on how much attacking you're doing and how much of it is on champions). You get your 130s CD ult down to 79 seconds with CDR and from there it's further reduced by your autoattacks. That's the beauty of CDR boots/Nashor's on Skarner--you're attacking much more quickly, shaving a significantly higher % of the cooldown off with each hit, and then using the AP for more damage, bigger shields, and gobs of sustain.

At this point, check your tear. If it's filled or close to filled (if it's not, you aren't spamming Q enough!), you should upgrade it to Archangel's/Seraph's posthaste (which I already talked about above). That 2000g nets you upwards of 120 AP, some mp5, and an awesome active, all without wasting an item slot. There are three other items I'll sometimes consider after CDR boots/Nashor's as well, those being **Seeker's Armguard, Twin Shadows, and Sheen**. The first two are reactive defensive purchases when you're up against an overwhelming amount of physical or magical damage and you're not in a particularly dominant position--resistances are really hard to itemize for in this build due to the overwhelming need for mana, CDR, and AP but they go a long way toward maximizing the efficacy of your shield and heal. Seeker's is highly cost-effective and is quick to fill with Skarner's waveclear, Twin Shadows is fantastic for the active which functions as a ghetto gap closer, helping you catch out enemies with your dash and ult. Sheen is something you're most likely going to be getting anyway right after after AA, but I'll sometimes pick it up beforehand if I need the power boost (particularly in regards to split pushing) and I only have enough for blasting wand, not the entire Archangel's.

At some point, enchant your boots with **Alacrity** for the gap closing/sticking power (the flat movespeed is particularly useful in conjunction with the % movespeed steroid on your W) or **Homeguard** if the area around/inside your base is being threatened. If you're stuck with the initiator role despite being fuckin' AP Skarner for fuck's sake, consider going with **Distortion** for the decreased cooldown on flash allowing for clutch grabs.

The last big item I tend to be able to build is **Sheen &gt; Lichbane**. With Nashor's and AA you should go over 200 AP; after Lichbane you'll break 300 for ~275 magic dmg on hit on a 2-second cooldown which is exceedingly easy to trigger with the sheer spammability of your spells. In fact, your Q is the -perfect- spell for triggering lichbane on towers, because its unreduced cooldown (keep in mind your passive does not proc on towers) is 2.14s at 39% CDR compared to a 2s internal cooldown on Sheen/Lichbane. You can proc it reliably, every single time it's up, without needing a target or anything. Add that on top of your blazingly fast attack speed and it's clear why AP Skarner is capable of demolition on an industrial scale.

Items to consider after Lichbane should include defensive choices such as **Guardian Angel, Warmog's, and Randuin's Omen**, tanky AP items like **Zhonya's Hourglass, Abyssal Scepter, and Liandry's Torment** (Liandry's is actually really great on AP Skarner--you have an AoE spell with a built-in permaslow, and the burn damage will instantly pop your E's heal on targets hit without requiring you to get in range and auto or Q them--plus you aren't getting spell pen on your boots so it fills that need well--the problem is fitting it in your main build), and raw damage items including **Rabadon's Deathcap, Void Staff, Muramana** (ok really if you're going to go in for the long haul and get both Muramana and Seraph's you should upgrade your first full tear into Muramana since most of the value is in the toggle and then turn a fresh tear immediately into AA) **and Malady**. If the game drags on long enough that you've filled out your items, replace your CDR boots with Sorc Shoes, Tabi, or Merc Treads (depending on what you need more) and use blue elixir to (mostly) fill the CDR hole they leave.

**CONCLUSION**

That's my AP Skarner in a nutshell. I'm not going to claim that he's competitively viable based on a few low-platinum ranked games and a handful of normals, but he certainly fills a unique niche that should appeal both to fans of Skarner disappointed in his s3 jungle performance, and those bored by the stagnant top lane ecosystem. I haven't had this much fun top since I rode Udyr to 2300 in s2 when he was still a staple of the lane (after the Wriggles/Turtle fix but before Jayce and Elise were released).

Oh, yeah, and three tips that I forgot to fit in elsewhere in the guide:

1. Try to impress upon your jungler the ease of ganking for Skarner and the importance of getting him off to a good start in order to get him snowballing. Typically all it takes is one kill for me to irrevocably win the lane no matter how much they try to camp me and bring me back down to size. Let him know every time your ult's up post-6, call out wards, and buy pinks to clear their wards or in case you're up against Akali/Rengar/Twitch etc.

2. Mana management is a big deal for AP Skar! Even with tear and flask, mana is a major limiting factor in keeping you in lane, which only makes sense because you have a heal and shield to turn that mana into sustain. There's nothing more embarrassing than popping W and flashing in for an ult only to realize that you're 10 mana short and watching them laugh all the way back to their turret. Once you're down to 200 or so mana you should consider shoving one last wave and backing because you no longer have enough for an extended engage. You can't count on blue buff as a top laner so you just have to work within those limitations. Thankfully, I can count on one hand the times I've run oom past 25 minutes or so into the game and most of those are because I was facerolling all my abilities on cooldown while autoattacking baron. Speaking of which, AP Skar is really good at doing baron! Good sustained damage and a heal and shield + a stationary target for constant auto CDR mean you make a pretty damn good tank (despite having built nothing tanky whatsoever)--and because most of your damage is coming from AP, Baron's AD debuff doesn't significantly impact your dps, meaning you can tank for someone like Vi or Xin for whom that debuff really matters.

3. Get good at mashing those buttons. In an extended engage, you can drop Q's in the double digits and pop new heals and shields every few seconds. Smartcast your E (smartcast everything is good advice in general, but particularly Skarner's E) and learn the range on that q because one narrowly-missed slow can be the difference between a flesh wound and a kill. Always try to reposition yourself in between autos when you're slowing them so they have to run next to or behind you rather than in front. Turn around at the end of your ult so you drag them to the opposite side of yourself (this is actually a lot simpler than it sounds; I picked up the practice by accident).",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1a8ex5,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1a8ex5/top_lane_apcdr_skarner_guide_for_skarner_fans/,

For those of you that don't know, Legendary Armor is [this mastery](http://i.imgur.com/PNHhhmg.png) in the defense tree. It increases your bonus armor and magic resistance by 2/3.5/5%. First of all, the word bonus should jump out at you; the ~80 armor that most champions get at level 18 isn't increased by the mastery.

The best case scenario for this mastery is heavily stacking a single resistance. Take Maokai stacking armor as an example:

* 13 - Yellow Runes
* 5 - Defense Tree
* 95 - Frozen Heart
* 70 - Randuin's Omen
* 45 - Sunfire Cape
* 25 - Ninja Tabi
* 30 - Bulwark

This gives him bonus armor of 283, with his 90 base armor this puts him at 373. The mastery will give you +14 extra armor, for a final total of 387.

If you apply 10,000 physical damage to that stack of massive stack of armor, then the extra +14 will leave you with 61.4 extra health. A 0.614% damage reduction compared to not having the mastery.

Considering that these mastery points are competing against difficult to aquire stats like Tenacity, slow resistance and reduced critical damage, your points are better spent elsewhere.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1fwegu,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1fwegu/why_the_legendary_armor_mastery_isnt_worth_getting/,

(Raw Damage by Opponent)*(Damage multiplier before cloth armor-Damage multiplier with cloth armor)

We are using armor yellows/quints and a level 1 riven. So in Wickd's example:

**500(0.6965-0.6306)=32.95 physical damage reduced.**

For his statement to be correct you would need a difference of damage multipliers to be 0.12 (calculated by dividing 60 by 500).

So, for this to happen you would have to assume both rivens have no base armor and no scaling armor and no armor runes and no armor masteries which would give you a difference of DmgMuli of about 0.13.

So Wickd, I've been a very big fan of yours, but it infuriates math people like me when you misinform 62k people on stream.

Meta-wise, as you can see, regen is very very very good when you are being hit with low damage. As damage increases you can see that the damage prevented also increases. Due to diminishing returns in DmgMulti (not effective health) per resistance point, early armor is the best armor. The question is whether early armor or early HP regen is best.

Armor:

+Doesn't fall off late game (gains effectiveness with increased damage taken and HP increases from leveling)

+increases effectiveness of heals and shields

-less sustain than HP sustain at early levels

HP regen:

+better HP sustain as long as you don't get hit an extreme amount (like early game)

-falls off late game (increases in damage taken and increases in your health and ending of laning phase)

-worth nothing if you get bursted

TL;DR So for early defenses HP regen definitely seems a viable alternative to King armor, at least for early game.

1358732934.0,79,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,16ynp4,FYI: Voidstaff deals more damage to targets with greater than 70-80MR,shriek56,87,8,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/16ynp4/fyi_voidstaff_deals_more_damage_to_targets_with/,"TL;DR : On almost every AP champion, Void Staff does more damage to targets with &gt;70-80MR and scales better than Deathcap while costing ~1000g less.

**First Calculation:**

REFERENCE FOR HOW TO CALCULATE: [Link](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_penetration)

I had a discussion in the main subreddit about whether Voidstaff or Deathcap was better with ~75mr and someone suggested I posted the calculations here, so here they are. I used syndra as a base example, due to her fairly high scaling. VS stands for void staff. DC stands for deathcap. The calculations are:

Full burst combo: 230(.6) + 160(.7) + 70(.4) + 675(1)

Simpler Form: 1135(2.7)

100AP from runes/masteries/dorans or whatever

Deathcap ((100 + 120) * 1.25 = 275 AP)

Voidstaff (170AP) + 35% pen

DC Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 275) = 1887.5

VS Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 170) = 1594

DC Damage With 80MR : 1887.5 * (100/(100 + 80)) = 1048.61

VS Reduction with 80MR: 80 * .65 = 52

VS Damage with 80MR: 1594 * (100/(100 + 52)) = 1048.68

**Scaling with Flat Penetration:**

As you'll see with these calculations, getting flat penetration (whether through items or runes) will cause a larger boost in damage if you already have % penetration (I used sorc shoes here):

DC Damage With 80MR : 1887.5 * (100/(100 + 80 - 15)) = 1143.93

VS Damage with 80MR: 1594 * (100/(100 + 52 - 15) = 1163.50

**Scaling With Other Types of Penetration:**

Unsurprisingly, getting either flat reduction, % reduction, or additional % penetration will reduce the benefit of void staff compared to deathcap. I used the 8% pen from masteries and left sorc shoes in, just to show how getting some flat pen (which is pretty common anyways) usually offsets any potential loss from other pen types.

DC Damage With 80MR : 1887.5 * (100/(100 + 73.6 - 15)) = 1190.10

VS Damage with 80MR: 1594 * (100/(100 + (47.84 - 15)) = 1199.93

**SCALING WITH ADDITIONAL AP:**

This is a very important section to note. It is a common misconception that Deathcap will scale better as you acquire more AP items. THIS IS FALSE. Void Staff will scale better than Deathcap per AP you acquire.

200AP

Deathcap (384AP)

Voidstaff (270AP)

DC Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 384)= 2171.8

VS Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 270)= 1864

DC Damage With 80MR : 2171.8 * (100/(100 + 73.6 - 15)) = 1369.36

VS Damage with 80MR: 1864 * (100/(100 + (47.84 - 15)) = 1403.19

**Scaling with enemy resistances:**

As the enemies gain more resistances, Void Staff will start to become even stronger than Deathcap. This should be fairly obvious, but just to demonstrate. Here, the target has 100 mr.

DC Damage With 80MR : 2171.8 * (100/(100 + 92 - 15)) = 1227

VS Damage with 80MR: 1864 * (100/(100 + (59.8 - 15)) = 1287.29

**Conclusions:**

As you see, Void Staff is a better item to get than Deathcap in most situations, as it scales better with Flat Pen, AP, and enemy resistances. It is also 1000g cheaper to build than Deathcap.

It isn't too hard to have an enemy get to 80mr either. Base stats, plus scaling, defensive tree, Aegis/Bulwark, mr items, and defensive steroids will guarantee that 2/5-4/5 will be around 80mr come 20 minutes.

You can pretty much swap out Deathcap purchases with Voidstaff purchases. Champions with built in Flat Reduction, % Reduction, and % Pen may not want to get a Voidstaff first (Xerath, Amumu, Fiddles, if someone bought abyssal, etc) (**EDIT:** I did the math in a post below. This is definitely not true for Xerath (And probably any of the others). Get Void Staff first.). If you get really fed quickly and the enemy team hasn't bulked up yet, a deathcap first may still be a good idea.

**Notes/Future Work**

For any champion, there is a ratio to determine what MR value allows VS to be better than DC. It is simply Base Damage / AP scaling. If anyone wanted to write the formula up formally or find it for popular AP champions, that would be cool.

1332435793.0,71,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,r8l40,Defining and changing the meta,OctilleryLOL,81,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/r8l40/defining_and_changing_the_meta/,"Long read ahead on game theory revolving around meta-strategies, why the meta exists, and what is required for it to shift.

There are lots of complaints about the current ""meta"" and how it is becoming ""stagnant"" or is ""boring"" to play. The latter is subjective, but the former is simply untrue. The meta isn't exactly changing every 3 days, but the popularity of specific setups is constantly changing. Therefore, the meta is constantly shifting. Maybe not all the way down the park bench, but repositioning itself such that it is comfortable. 

The current meta exists because it is an easy to use strategy that takes advantage of the inherent mechanics of the game. The meta will only change if another single setup is the top tier in terms of matchups. This cannot happen with just adding one champion, or with nerf/buff cycles. There needs to be a power shift in the gold scalability versus level scalability of non-ad carries.

As of right now, bruisers need gold and levels, and aren't particularly good at ganking, but are good at escaping ganks. Therefore, they sit in the long lane at top, so that even if they push out a bit while farming (which occurs naturally), they can survive a gank if it comes. They don't need the accessibility of mid lane, and running a duo lane costs them far too many levels. While sitting at top lane, far away from the early game objective (dragon), bruisers are able to gain the early gold advantage relative to the other lanes, so that they are durable enough (with gold) and strong enough (with levels) to have an impact on midgame.

Mages need levels in the early game to stay strong. One level for a mage is, on average, 80-ish damage. You will not get 80 damage worth of AP (which, for most mages, is ~60 AP) from the gold lost by not going bot lane for safer farm. If you're zoned out by mid camping, you're still gaining experience (hopefully), so you don't need to worry about that. The inability of many mages to escape ganks is nullified somewhat by the fact that mid lane is short, so you don't need to run very far; flash is an almost guaranteed out against some gankers, while most gankers are completely nullified by two wards on either side. The added benefit of mid lane is the accessibility of all map objectives and the other lanes. Therefore, it makes sense for your strongest early game character to take the lane with the most accessibility to early game fights. Furthermore, it makes sense for your strongest early game character to be able to gank both side lanes, if possible.

Since AD carries don't gain much damage off of levels, they sit in bot lane with a support; xp is not as important as gold. Since the support wards for the carry, they save all their gold to buy damage while not having to worry about ganks. Furthermore, the ability of the support to deny enemy kills/harrass allows the ad to farm more gold than they would solo. Once the ad has damage, the damage is presented in a sustained and ranged form, so it is effective in all situations.

Now the reason I typed out all this information that people probably know is to provide an immediate reference for how the meta works. Once you understand how it works, then you can understand what is required to change it. To change the meta, at least one of these lane setups must be sub-optimal. Not counterable, but SUB-OPTIMAL. Since bottom lane is the most common complaint, I will use bottom lane specific examples for the remainder of this response. For example, if the only way to compete against to soraka kog is playing soraka kog, then the game is not balanced. In a deep, balanced game, every choice should have counters that is not itself. What we are looking for, however, is the strongest, most optimal lane setup.

However, the setup of support/ad is far from sub-optimal. That is the key factor that makes support/ad lanes such as cait soraka more favorable than kill lanes such as jarvan leona. The reason for this is that the damage from ad carries is almost entirely mandatory, and a person that does dedicated ward control is mandatory too. Outside of laning, a support ad combo is much more important to a team than a jarvan and leona combo, or a taric and brand combo. Unless the latter two create a large advantage by forgoing the ad carry, they will be in a poor position for the mid/late game tower sieges. It is because this combination of support and ad bottom lane is very optimal and strong that it is the most common thing people will run, which is therefore the ""meta.""

In every game, once the relatively strongest strategy is established, counter-strategies are developed and used against the meta. If these strategies become near-optimal, AND counters the current near-optimal meta setup, then the meta ""shifts"" to the new strategy. Otherwise, the strategy is simply a counter; a situationally employed strategy.

In bottom lane, counters exist; these counters are in the form of soft counters. The setup of passive AD support has viable counters in the form of a kill lane that is AD support (better interpreted as a lane that's really good at early game fighting). An ad support kill lane is countered harder by some dedicated kill lanes. The most popular being jarvan leona run by goose, or a burst AD and blitzcrank/alistar lanes. However, jarvan leona is not going to do amazingly well against soraka cait, bringing the countering full circle, as they don't deny soraka cait farm. In all of this, player skill is still the most important, of course. However, the existence of these soft counters gives a slight advantage to the team that picks their champions wisely and in the correctly in response to their opponent's picks.

Therefore, in order to break the meta, at least one strategy (not specific setup) must exist that directly counters the current meta, AND be optimal in relation to the rest of the team. Such a thing is more likely to occur to the game in every lane simultaneously than in one lane at a time.

TL;DR, the most optimal strategy is the most popular, the most popular strategy is the ""meta."" To change the meta, a different strategy must counter the current meta strategy AND be as optimal or more optimal in which case, it will naturally become the most popular strategy.

Seriously, though, read above. I put a lot of time into studying competitive games and game design and believe I wrote a lot of good and interesting information.

* 1. For starters, **there is no one single ""right"" way to play a champion. League is designed to have multiple viable options for how to play champions,** which allows for infinitely more counterplay, which is a large part of why League is such a great game. 

Morgana is a good example of this, as she can fight comfortably into just about any composition. Her long range abilities and passive spellvamp give her good poke ability, her shield and CC are excellent peeling abilities, her pool can clear waves quickly, and her peeling abilities also serve well as escape mechanisms making her a good splitpusher, her ult is a powerful AOE ability, and her ult's ability to function excellently with Zhonya's make her one of the best diving carries in the game. 

However, maximizing her potential through her build depends on the comp she is working with. In a poke composition chalice-&gt;grail is a good choice because the MR and infinite mana allow for missed pokes and infinite trading. Rod of Ages works better if she is going to be diving because the infinite mana is not needed in a hard engage, while the extra health comes in much more useful than MR when it comes to being nuked down. In other words, two people can play Morgana very differently (passive vs. aggressive, etc.), including having different builds, and both of them be maximizing her potential.

 Even if someone is not maximizing potential fully (perhaps they got Tear of the Goddess on Morg for some reason) if it is what they are used to it is what they will do best with for now. If they are a friend you may want to tell them there are better options, but if they are a stranger in Solo Queue it's best to just make the most of what they are doing, whether they are performing well that game or not. Remember, **Solo Queue is for you to improve yourself, not your team.**

* 2. Okay, with that out of the way let's look at what you ""pay for"" in a kit when you select one champion from all the rest. Perfect Balance is impossible to truly achieve in reality, but Riot can get close enough to Perfect Balance that we assume every character is worth just as much as every other character, we simply choose which combination of tools we like in a champion when we choose them. This means we trade off some tools for others, and understanding the ramifications of that choice allow us to better utilize it.

For an example, let's look at one of my favorite characters, [Nunu] (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Nunu). With the recent buffs to his consume, he is very popular as a jungler right now. Consume can be very helpful in counterjungling (particularly with the recent buffs it received, while it loses some effectiveness in teamfights and dueling, even if you are able to to find minions to use it on to get the heal. 

A similar ability to Nunu's Consume is Cho'Gath's [Feast] (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cho%27Gath). Because of the cooldown on Feast, the fact that Cho'Gath has to wait until L6 to get it, and the health gain for an impending duel will probably be less, it is not as potent in counterjungling as Consume is. However, the feast stacks, if they are able to be built up, are more useful once a teamfight starts, and the fact that it can be used on enemy champions also makes it a much better ability for teamfighting. So, while Consume has more use as a counterjungling tool, Feast Performs better in teamfights.

Because of this (Ignoring all other abilities for the sake of simplicity), we can say that Nunu is better at counterjungling than Cho'Gath, and Cho'Gath is better at teamfighting.

Assuming this is true, and Cho'Gath is on Blue team while Nunu is on the Purple team, Nunu will want to counterjungle Cho'Gath because he knows he will be at a disadvantage when it comes to teamfighting.**Recognizing the types of situations where you are stronger than your opponent and forcing them into those situations provides maximum opportunity to outplay them. Big plays don't happen in the heat of the moment, they are carefully set up.**

Let's look at a this concept in a different context. Take a support like Sona, Nami, or Lulu. Their heals/shields, ranged autoattacks, and pokey abilities are designed to be used to gradually harass/out-trade the opponent out of lane, while a support with hard engage, lots of cc, and some form of anti-burst (usually a shield) such as Leona, Blitzcrank, or Nautilus is designed to force (and win) a hard engage. In a match up where a poker/sustainer is against a hard engager, the poker wants to be forcing opportunities to harass (usually by pushing a minion wave), requiring constant pressure, while the hard engager (usually by using bush control) wants to catch them when they overextend, go in for a bad trade, or otherwise get into a place where a fight can be forced.

Both types of supports have an equal chance at winning, just like Nunu and Cho'gath have equal chances of winning, and while there are too many factors to calculate here, exactly who will win will be largely determined by who pushes the strengths of their kit, while defending the weaknesses of it. **If a large part of your kit is poke, you should probably be poking, if a very small part of your kit is poking, you probably shouldn't be poking.**

I want to leave you with the thought that **every decision, from the moment you choose your champion until the announcer declares the victor, is a trade.** Understanding what you are getting for what you are giving up (e.g. giving up some safety to harass an opponent) is the key to making trades that will put you ahead.

During a game last night, we saw the Baron die without seeing anyone in the Baron pit attacking him (we had a ward there).


I did some research and figured out how the enemy Mundo was able to kill Baron without us knowing. You basically abuse the DoT from Liandry's, combined with the % health damage from Cleaver and 30% increased damage from Spirit of the Spectral Wraith. By carefully kiting back and forth, you take minimal damage from Baron while killing him, by yourself, in under a minute. If you are Purple side this basically equals a free, safe Baron whenever Baron is up.


For the video I went 9/21/0 with MPen runes, to maximize the amount of damage his Cleavers will do. You really only need Liandry's and Spirit of the Spectral Wraith to do this, although MPen boots help.
I haven't had a chance to try this with Dragon yet, although I doubt it works.

Rylai's is an obvious choice to give him a small 15% permaslow aura, but with only 350 movespeed it's not really enough to let him keep pace with targets for his burn damage.

So I came to Shard of True Ice. Normally a support item, it costs only 1600 gold while giving 4 GP10 for 45 AP, a 5 MP5 aura, and a 60 second cooldown active ability that gives a 30% slowing aura with a pretty wide radius for 4 seconds. You can cast this on any ally, not only champions, so after stunning for 1.75 seconds with Tibbers you can cast Shard on him, and slow the enemy team for 4 seconds without any of your teammates staying in melee range for it.

If you add a Liandry's Torment to your build, Tibbers will be dealing 35 + 0.2 AP per second plus 4% current HP damage per second for the 6 seconds that they're CC'd, (and 2% for 3 seconds afterwards) which adds up to pretty huge base damage + AP ratio if you sit in it for that long. With a Bulwark on your team, Tibbers has 2100 HP, 60 armor, 75 MR at level 11, and 3000 HP, 80 armor, 95 MR at level 16. That's decently hard to kill unless they really put a lot of damage into it, which could be a deadly mistake if they're also taking damage from your team.

I feel Shard is easily cheap enough for what it does to be worth picking up for yourself, but ideally you might want your support to get one. Regardless, I was wondering if any readers have insightful thoughts.

1360512973.0,64,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,18913n,Champions that deals %HP in physical/magic damages to counter the current meta?,Sealc,70,6,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/18913n/champions_that_deals_hp_in_physicalmagic_damages/,"As we all know, the curent meta is about stacking giant's belt items and be so tanky that no one can deal any damages to you. So you end up fighting 5 tanks that have at least 3k Hp and about 100-150 armor and a lot less magic resist. I think it would be interesting to have a discussion about the champions that can take advantage of that.

Here's a list of champions that can deal %HP damage an can potentially be used to deal with the HP meta :

* **Amumu :**  His W can do a very good amount of damage in an extended teamfights but he can't stack AP without giving up a bit of his tankyness and be less durable.

* **Brand :**  He is certainly one of the most interesting champion in this list. He has no escape mecanism and really needs to be protected but his passive allows him to deal 8% of the enemy HP each time he lands a spell. With some Mpen, he could probably destroy an entire team that hasn't any MR.

* **Mundo :**   His cleaver is more of a poking tool and he needs a finisher to be really effective.
 
* **Elise :**  She has poking and a finisher with only her Q. That makes her a great counter to the current meta. Sadly, she seems to be less potent in teamfight than in laning phase.

* **Evelynn :**  Her ultimate is a wonderful initiation ability, if you manage to combine that with a good finisher, the number of HP your opponent has will not matter.

* **Garen :**  His ultimate can pretty much Kill anyone that is low on health. But it has quite a long CD and you still need the initial damage on you target.

* **Jayce :**  His E deals %HP in magic damages but scales with AD. You need to get some MPen if you want this ability to really be effective against tanky target, but you don't have any itemization choice to do that with jayce.

* **Kha'zix :**  His evolved Q does 12% of the target missing health if isolated, that's a good finisher. However you usually want to evolve E first and W second on kha'zix and I don't know how effective evolving Q before that would be.

* **Kog'maw :**  Kog'maw ability to melt tanky target is great. He probably is one of the AD carry that is the least bothered by this meta. But he needs protection because he has no escape and is very squishy.

* **Lee sin :**  While his Q isn't the best finisher out there, it's pretty decent and if used well can make a difference in a teamfight.

* **Malzahar :**  His W last for 5 second and deals %HP every second. This can be huge if you are able to force the enemy team to stand in it with some CC.

* **Poppy :**  The %HP damage she has on her Q can't exceed a certain number and you need to hit the enemy a lot with it to manage to kill him.

* **Varus :**  His magic damage when using blight can help him a lot when fighting tanky target but as every ADC in this list, he can't escape a sticky situation with an ability so he needs some peeling.

* **Vayne :**  Vayne late game is a scary thing, she can destroy tanky target and at least has some form of escape.

* **Vi :**  Vi does a lot of %HP in physical damage. She needs some armor pen and stick to her target to actually use it well which can be a bit tricky.

* **Xin Zhao :**  His ult is an initiation tool that deals 15% of the enemy current health, it's not as good as Evelynn's ultimate but it still is great against stacking hp.

*  **Zed :**  His passive allows him to deal %HP in magic damage to injured target. This can be great to finish off tanky target that aren't in a good shape.


So do you guys think these champions can help kill the warmogs/sunfire meta?

1373418846.0,57,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1hz5ao,2 Solo 1 Duo: The rise of generic solo laners in competitive play (analysis article),PraiseLoL,69,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1hz5ao/2_solo_1_duo_the_rise_of_generic_solo_laners_in/,"Until recently in League of Legends, players defined themselves by their roles, and more specifically, what lane they resided in. Lately however, this identity has become less fixed, and more often than not, incorrect. When once the AD carry and Support found themselves in a 2v2 bottom lane duel, they are now more commonly found pushing a turret 2v1 in the top or middle lanes. Likewise, top and middle laners are now subjected to 1v2s, required to stay alive, protect their turret, and farm what they can. This metagame shift, along with other progressions in strategy, has lead to the concept of having two generic solo laners, and one duo lane (2 solo 1 duo). This shift opens up a realm of new strategic possibilities for teams, and is something that I have found to be the most interesting meta shift in a long time.

First and foremost, it is important to explain what this change means for competitive strategy. In essence, teams will decide the location of each laner on a game-by-game basis, in order to fit what they hope to achieve with their strategy. An example of this would be to send Caitlyn &amp; Fiddlesticks middle, with the intention to fast-push the turret against a team with weak wave clear. A laner with superior dragon control, or team fight potential such as Orianna may then be placed bottom, with a split-pusher or duelist such as Zed being placed in the top lane. Looking at this structure, not much is different from the traditional lane setup; bottom simply swaps with the middle laner. However, it is not the result, or what you see, that is significant, but the thought process behind the decision. To elaborate, a team could run a traditional lane setup while still adopting the 2 solo 1 duo framework, as long as the location of the laners is not due to convention, but in order to implement a strategy.

So why is this lane setup superior to the traditional setup?  Simply put, a flexible strategy will destroy a rigid strategy any day of the week. By adopting the traditional lane setup, lane matchups become paramount as teams are forced to lane against their respective counterparts (top v top, mid v mid, etc). This means that if someone was counter-picked, or simply less skilled than their opponent, they were forced into an unfavourable matchup, usually relying on jungle pressure (which took pressure off the rest of the map). Interestingly, this was why the final pick was valued so highly for the top lane in North America for much of Season 2, due to the snowballing nature of top lane, and the pressure drawn from having a winning matchup.

In the current meta, and most notably in Korea, almost the opposite approach is adopted: champion picks are selected for the team composition and strategy, whereas the traditional lane matchups are not important. This is one of the main advantages of running 2 solos and 1 duo: you can pick for your team composition and generally not be forced into bad matchups, through lane swapping. It has been well documented in competitive play that team compositions are more important than lane matchups (unless a massive gold lead is accrued in the laning phase), and thus, picking for the team composition will always be superior to picking for the lane.

There have been many notable occasions where the 2 solo 1 duo setup has been used in competitive play – in fact every time a lane swap occurs, I would argue that it is being adopted. A prime example of a successful team using it is found in CJ Blaze, from the OGN (2nd place in Champions Spring 2013). The Blaze bottom lane, Cpt Jack and Lustboy, is notorious for dying in lane 2v2, despite having good team fight play and mechanics. For many of their games this season however, they adapted by laning 2v1 either middle or top – reducing the impact of one of the main weaknesses in their team. If they had followed the traditional lane setup, this weakness may have been a greater problem during Champions. In addition to this, the 2v1 lane allows Blaze to fast push an early turret with the jungler, to gain an early gold and map advantage. Thus, using the 2 solo 1 duo setup gave Blaze 2 notable benefits: 1) The ability to avoid their bottom lane’s weak laning phase and 2) Early strategic victory through fast pushing a turret.

Recent champion picks have also made it obvious that teams are now leaning towards two generic solo laners. To elaborate, five of the most popular solo lane choices in competitive play recently -Jayce, Kennen, Kha’Zix, Ryze, and Zed – all have previously been found in the traditional top and middle lanes. When previously there was well defined, non-overlapping champions for both the mid and top lanes, now the distinction is not so clear. Even champions who have only been played in the middle lane traditionally, such as Karthus or Orianna, have made their way to the top and bottom lanes commonly in the NA LCS, in order to implement specific strategies.

Another interesting change has been for many teams to recently swap their “official” top and mid positions. While this has little impact on where the players lane, it is significant because it symbolises that teams are also recognising that the two solo lanes are interchangeable. Cloud 9, Team Solo Mid, and Reapered’s old team all announced that they were swapping the top and mid positions, with Maknoon also talking about moving to mid. It appears that the reason for the change, with the exception of TSM, is to move the leaders of the teams (Hai, Reapered, Maknoon) to the middle lane; this may be indicative of a shotcalling position.

*Note: TSM’s Reginald moved to the top lane however, despite being the captain and shotcaller for his team. It has been speculated that this was so Reginald could conduct the picks and bans in the LCS himself, instead of having to go through Dyrus (as the top laner is first in champion select).*

The 2 solo 1 duo setup provides flexibility, allows for superior strategic control, and also provides the ability to pick for the desired team composition, without worrying about individual lane matchups. It is not a strategy, but a framework that provides teams all of these benefits. While it has already made its way into competitive play, it is a development in the meta that has been almost overlooked by the average viewer, up until recently. This advancement is one of the most interesting progressions in competitive strategy to date, and I believe it will be very important, moving forward in competitive play.

I theorycraft about this game quite a bit with a couple of other players, so I thought that I would write a quick post on the current  state of Jungling in League of Legends. 

As a quick precursor to my discussion, I will be referencing what I refer to as the 'snowball meta' which is the current and upcoming trend in LoL to have a very strong team that can carry away a large lead in the early game. This was demonstrated by M5 at Kiev. I will also be referencing the current obsession with wards and their use to make lanes as safe as possible during the laning phase right now.

In the snowball meta of League of Legends that is becoming popular, the role of jungler is becoming more and more game changing. Prior to the current state of the game it was much easier to play jungler and gank due to the fact that very few lanes would reliably ward at regular intervals, and this meant that many different junglers were viable since they were able to run right to the lane without being detected. However, since the prevalence of Support(wardbot) +carry bot it has become much more popular to always ward lanes and nearly impossible to gank with many junglers that used to be considered top tier. These changes in the metagame have led to what I see as two distinct types of junglers emerging that work completely differently. 

The first type of jungler that is viable now is one that can reliably perform early ganks by sneaking past common ward spots or that has easy to use gap closers that can lead to kills. A couple of examples would be a Shaco or Lee Sin that starts at red and goes straight to a lane to try and get a kill. This type of jungler has the ability to get a strong lead early on, however if he fails to successfully gank a lane with that early buff, then he will be put behind the second type of jungler that we will talk about. 

This second type of jungler is one that may not have remarkable early game ganks, they have the ability to clear the jungle every time a camp spawns, and most importantly at level 6 they have a ult that gives them extremely strong ganks that are almost failproof with cooperation from the lane. These are junglers like Shyvana, Skarner, etc that clear the jungle extremely fast, can get fast items, can typically counter-jungle, and at level 6 have abilities that give them incredibly strong ganks. Shyvana was recently demonstrated to be a strong jungler at Kiev and at level 6 she has the ability to swoop in from a multitude of angles and pull off strong ganks in any lane. Junglers like WW work like this to a certain extent because they have a significant increase in utility at level 6 , however due to slower farming, he will not be as effective as other junglers in this group. 

These are the trends that I'm seeing in the current jungle, and I thought that a post like this may spur ideas for jungling more effectively. Feel free to add me on NA LoL (same name) to talk theory, or to respond to this post to encourage further discussion on the topic. The thoughts of many are stronger than the thoughts of few.

Quick Edit: Would anyone be interested in hearing more analysis about other roles in a way similar to this? I wouldn't mind taking the time to write up a bit more on each role.

1373456993.0,56,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1i02tg,"League of Draven [New Passive, My Opinion]",Quantumm,67,11,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1i02tg/league_of_draven_new_passive_my_opinion/,"His old passive gave a small amount of bleed damage on critical hits and Spinning axe uses.  I get that there is quite a bit of early game damage potential in that basic 30 + 4xLvL. &lt;--**OLD PASSIVE**

**NEW PASSIVE**

When Draven catches a Spinning Axe, or kills a minion or monster, he gains one stack of Adoration. When Draven kills an enemy champion, he consumes half of his Adoration stacks and gains **3 gold per stack** consumed. Draven loses half of his Adoration stacks upon death.

Lets say you caught 50 axes while getting 100 minions.  Pretty reasonable if you are pretty good at draven,  and CS relatively fluently at all times.  Even if its not reasonable,  lets just keep it for the examples sake.

That's 150 stacks.

A singular kill with 150 stacks would consume 75 stacks,  75*3= 225.

By doing this and getting a **singular** kill,  you are effectively getting almost double the gold.  Assuming killed enemy has no bounty, and its not first blood.

A double kill with this 150 stacks would give 150/2=75/2=36 rounded up, Equals 75+36=111 stacks consumed.

So it would give a base of 600 gold, plus 225 for the first half of the stacks on League of Draven, plus another 108 gold for the next half of whats left.  Equaling out to a beastly 933 gold for a double kill.

Now lets keep in mind,  I'm not sure if it was specified that while getting a double kill,  the second kill will remove the same amount of stacks as the first kill, as long as they were in quick succession.  But I'm pretty sure they wouldn't make it do that,  considering that with 200 stacks you'd get four kills worth of gold off a double kill.

ALSO,  keep in mind this passive gives a reason to catch out people who feed to hell and are worth nothing.  That 0/8 Vayne that's worth 50 gold could be turned into an easy 200.

In my **opinion**,  people need to stop crying in the patch video about how this nerf is game changing.  Its not.  Hes not an early game Rape Wagon anymore,  but that doesn't mean the new passive is bad.

Opinions?

1364088244.0,56,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1aw2xh,Major Udyr changes coming: a detailed analysis of the PBE patch notes,GANGBANGARANG,64,8,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1aw2xh/major_udyr_changes_coming_a_detailed_analysis_of/,"With each new PBE patch comes welcome change to the fields of justice, and the most recent beneficiary was none other than the fabled manbearphoenix. Hi, I'm G. Bangarang and today I'll take you on a trip to the top lane to observe how the Udyr is adapting to its changing environment. (I'll be leaving any jungle analysis to someone with more expertise than I)

It seems like just yesterday that Udyr was one of the most dominant predators the top lane had ever seen, capable of using Turtle Stance to shake off dire blows and Tiger Stance to deal unparalleled damage. Although he lacked the maneuverability and utility of his competitors, he was able to keep them in their place with sheer strength and sustainability.

The winds of change were not favorable to Udyr, however. New foes like the crafty Jayce and dreaded Elise moved in to claim the lane as their own with range and control that Udyr could not hope to match. The last straw came with the removal of dodge from the game and from his passive for which he was not reimbursed because his cousin, the Udyr native to the jungle, was strong enough without it. Soon, the majestic manbearphoenix was nigh extinct, lost to the sands of time...

But Riot knows pity, even for him.

The tentative PBE changes: www.reignofgaming.net/news/23644-unofficial-pbe-patch-notes-for-3-22-2013

**Passive**

The theme of this major update to Udyr seems to be usability, sacrificing some of his raw power for greater agility and utility. This is no more evident than in his passive, where the not-insignificant bonus resists he recently got as a season 3 consolation prize are being swapped out for a touch of movespeed: 3/5ths of boots 1 at 3 stacks. It may seem like a nerf and in practice it likely will be, but as birds with brittle bones, Udyr must shed some of his defenses to soar once more. This is one of three maneuverability buffs that should allow Udyr to better keep pace with the rest of the league in its advanced state of mobility creep.

**Tiger Stance**

The least changed of his 4 abilities, tiger stance benefits from the across-the-board mana cost reduction and now deals physical rather than magical damage. What this means is that there's now a greater interaction with itemization: tiger Udyrs can get armor pen in addition to AD (aka Brutalizer and its upgrades. Interesting to note is that being a physical dot, it will stack black cleaver very quickly) to improve their damage and his prey can focus on armor instead of having to itemize against mixed damage. This, I think, is a dangerous direction to go as it specifically makes Randuin's Omen too hard a counter to tigerdyr--but there are ways around that with slow reductions and the newly buffed phoenix stance.

**Turtle Stance**

Turtle stance is to lose two unique mechanics with these changes: with Taric's passive change, Udyr is currently the only champion with %dmg mana restore and a no-crit mechanic. The critical disability is a throwback to eras long past when melee carries roamed the rift, and phantom dancers (and Udyr's passive) included dodge. PD lost its dodge many moons ago and melee carries evolved into bruisers with few exceptions. It's a small change but it should slightly increase the value of items like Triforce, Atma, and Ghostblade to keep his offensive power from falling off a cliff lategame even if you choose to build for it. The biggest change to turtle is that with the mana cost reductions and mana leech removal, Udyr is no longer dependent on turtle to keep his mana up. This is a bigger deal in top lane than it might seem as it gives you more freedom to use rank 1 stances for trades, escapes, and engages, and gives turtle a better-defined role as a purely defensive skill. The increased shield strength at later levels helps mitigate the loss of bonus resists as well and will probably be the first place Riot looks at for buffs in the future if this overhaul does not quite hit the mark.

""Now hold on, Mr. Bangarang,"" you may be saying, ""this sounds fucking terrible! Tiger and turtle are the staple skills of top Udyr and both of them are losing key elements of their strength. Why do you sound so goddamned eager about one of your favorite champs being gutted like a fish?""

**Bear Stance**

Ignores unit collision. Have 3 words ever sounded so beautiful? In addition, it now includes a lunge effect (don't call it a dash--it does NOT increase the effective range of your attack in any way) that brings you closer to the target on hit and tracks their movement like Garen's Q so you don't simply stop moving during your foreswing, saving valuable time during the stun for more attacks and making it much easier to orbwalk (stutter step, animation cancel) through the target for effective chasing distance. This is a major usability change, and since bear is typically left at rank 1 through the laning phase, it benefits the most from the mana buffs. This is the most exciting change for most Udyr players and is probably the driving reason for the power shifts elsewhere as it would be nearly impossible to balance with Live Udyr's raw strength.

**Phoenix Stance**

Notice how I said most Udyr players above? That's because I'm most excited about this one: Phoenix activates on the first and every third hit after instead of just every third. It's losing the free AP and AD to help mitigate this buff (and because free ""invisible"" stats are something Riot has been making a concerted effort to cull in favor of gameplay-oriented elements--of the past 10 champion releases, only Zed has combat stats with no correlated gameplay). In addition, the proc is getting a hefty ap ratio buff with a tiny ratio nerf on the immolate effect. In the past, phoenix stance was a typically poor choice in top lane because it pushed hard and was difficult to get on-third-hits on the enemy. Now you can combo tiger into phoenix (the same way you currently do with bear) for a huge first hit and then have the option to switch to bear to set up another offensive rotation. Pop phoenix again after your 3rd hit for double aoe chunks. With the switch to a physical tiger stance, phoenix should fill the mixed damage void nicely.

What does this mean for future builds? I think 1 pt in tiger will become standard unless you're seriously snowballing the lane, with a shift into turtle if you're on the defensive and phoenix if you want lane pressure. You can run Arpen reds to make tiger hit way harder, or hybrid pen to make phoenix scale better. Brutalizer and all its upgrades are seriously looking attractive right now, and Bork, Triforce and Gauntlet should remain extremely solid pickups. Alacriswifties are already practically broken against heavy slows and will remain the ideal choice if they're not drowning in hard cc or heavy physical damage. Randuin, Sunfire, Mallet, Mogs, Locket, Atma, Wits, Aegis, and Visage are all great defense-oriented pickups. With no turtle mana regen, flask start with an early glacial should be even better than it already is.  I'm interested in seeing how items like Nashors and Liandry play out with the phoenix buff but I have a boner for melee ap tops so take my excitement with a grain of salt--Udyr lacks certain mechanics that make things like Skarner work after all.

tl;dr Is it an objective buff? Certainly not. Is it an effective buff? Most likely, and it opens up lots of new options for Riot to make numbers changes should the update not bring Udyr to the place they would like.

Runes: Mag Pen reds, GP10 yellows/quints, AP blues.

Starting items: Flask and 2 wards.

Support Zilean is an excellent choice.  Start Q (bomb).  Ward the river and sit in the bushes.  Use your long AA range and bombs to zone the hell out of the enemy carry.  Your goal is to pop out and place an AA bomb AA every time the carry comes close.  Start harrassing hard and keep strong- don't give up control of the bushes if you can.  At lvl 2, get W (rewind).  Now AA, Q, W, Q, AA for that poke.  Those 2 bombs have excellent base damages.  The enemy carry will be taken to 1/2 hp with one combo.  Your AD carry should be farming untouched, or happy to jump in for a kill if the positioning is good.  At 3, get E for the gank escapes or kill chases (excellent on Vayne, for example).  Then max Q.  

In an ideal world, their carry is about to have a mental break down.  They can't get gold.  They can't come close enough to even get experience without a bomb on their head.  The pyschological damage is just as bad as the actual bomb damage.  People tend to run away with a bomb, or fret and dance about for those several seconds.  Too often a bombed carry will hit the support as well, or vice versa.  Almost nobody does the right thing- stand next to the creeps so my bomb hits them, denying the carry gold.  Nobody does that, especially when our harrass is so strong.

At 6, Zilean's ult is unmatched.  If you're fortunate enough to have voice comms or even a typing AD carry, then communicate.  Nothing beats your carry diving or being dived, then reviving under a tower and winning the fight.  

Take 2 lvls of E, as the speed burst at lvl 2 is signifigantly better than lvl 1.  Then when you can't max R or Q, max W.  Spam that shit all day whenever your ult is on CD.  At lvl 18 with 39% CD, it's about a 22 second ultimate.  

From flask wards get philo stone and sighstone.  When you have E lvled up, you are so fast.  Warding is easy.  When you spawn, just E, W, E, W, E, (etc) till you get wherever you are going.  Quickly.

Next get boots of CD, then a chalice.  You will need the mana regen and CD reduction from Athene's as a final item.  At this point you can spam your spells.  And you will have enough money w/o taking any farm.  GP/10's plus the harass assists and pickpocket do it easy.  Late game, buy an aegis.

Now you can do things like:  Oh no a team fight! Speed your AD carry(E), Bomb their carry (Q), Exhaust their diver, Rewind (W), Rebomb their carry doing AOE damage (Q), Slow their diver again (E), oh no protect the carry (R), Carry comes back to life! 
That is one burst with only global CDs.  That can all be done in 3 seconds or so.

Cons: What? No. Well, maybe. I hate seeing a support leona on the other team.  I only start with 11 armor at lvl 1, so a diving team is rough.  You can out poke anyone though.  

Till lvl 3, be super careful as you don't have your speed up.  I have died mashing a greyed out E in vain.  If you manage to get zoned out, then you may lose the lane.  Your job is to psychologically break the enemy, and you need to bush bomb to accomplish that.

Many a game I have done more damage than 4/5 of their team, getting more gold, with only 15 creeps or so.  ",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1jqirg,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1jqirg/in_defense_of_support_zilean/,
1360424308.0,51,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1870uu,Void staff is a better first item than deathcap for Leblanc.  Also magic pen spreadsheet,,59,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1870uu/void_staff_is_a_better_first_item_than_deathcap/,"Here is the spread sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AofYL952iD_BdGV6VmNuWXl2eXJiVE1iQkRfdkRZc1E#gid=0

What i have found by doing some arithmetic is that void staff is better than deathcap on Leblanc, even early game.  What is shown on the spreadsheet is the comparison between two Leblanc builds at level 9.  They both have 9 mpen reds, AP quints, and irrelevant blues and yellows(you can pretend they are magic resist and hp per level if you want to).  They also have Sorceror's shows, 6 flat ap from masteries, 1 ap per level, 8% magic pen, and 5% increased ap.  The difference between the two leblancs is that the first one has a deathcap(3200 gold) and the second one has a void staff and a blasting wand(3155 gold).

The first column is the ability.  The second is the item build.  The third gives the damage it does.  You can scroll to the right to see all the math that generated those numbers.  As you can see, at level 9, void will make her q do more damage, but her other abilities will do less damage.  Her w and abilities at this point have 1 or two skill points in them so they have low base damage.  The higher level she gets the better void staff becomes for these abilities.

Even factoring in those abilities, void staff is better at this point though.  If you look at the numbers that say deathcap combo damage and void staff combo damage, you can see the damage of this comgo: Q + mimic Q them, land w on them,land chains on them,get full damage on snare, use Q on them without activating the second part of sigil because you are out of cooldowns.  If you look at this comparison, void staff plus blasting wand does 30 more damage.

That might not seem like a lot, but when you consider that her Q and ult do more damage always with void staff, any Q harass you get on them before you all in them will be much stronger with the void staff build.  Also noteworthy is that at 30 mr, the void staff Q hits harder than the deathcap Q.  The enemy getting magic resist from runes or items widens the gap and makes void staff do even more work.

If you change all the relevant fields you can use this spreadsheet for other champions, runes, item combinations, and other magic resistances.  You'll find that the void blasting wand combo is more damaging than death cap on nearly every champion.

I know stuff like this pops up once a week on this subreddit and their usually just counters to the current meta but I think this could become the new standard.  Lets discuss and please feel free to disagree.

The old meta revolved around these idea:

1. Mid mages got solo exp because they scale on lvls more than gold early and mid game.  Mages also used to be significantly less mobile (ie Brand, Malz, etc) so they could take advantage of the shorter lane to run under tower.  Now we've have plenty of ap damage that can handle a longer solo lane due to mobility creep.  Any AP champ we see going top could handle a 1v1 lane bot (ie Diana, Kat, Rumble, Kayle etc)

2. ADC and support defaulted to bot because it provided 3 people near dragon for each team.  With ADC and support mid, you still have 3 people near dragon.

3. ADC and support mid means that we basically have another roamer in the support that can gank either lane.  Mid is a short lane making it easier to get to safety if support leaves to gank.  

For a while, it'll be interested to see this mix with the current meta.  a 2v1 bot will hurt solo laner but the 2v1 mid should equally handicap the opposing team's mid laner. 

I believe this could become standard because it addresses all the ideas that formed the old meta while adding the ability for a second roaming ganker in the support.

* Cass has very strong teammate synergy, working well with champions like Taric, MF, Sona and Amumu - all very strong/popular and strong AOE comps.

I'll include a few of my own for example:   
1. Graves: Revert change of base Aspd from .625 to .638 - Attack speed was made more expensive and many typical sources of it for ADC (Greaves, Phantom) were hit hardest.  
2. Corki: Hextech Shrapnel shells benefit from critical strikes at 75% effect. Getting IE was probably too strong adding a whopping 25% of his AD as true damage but with the increase in tank health and loss of Triforce as an efficient DPS item he could use a bit more tank shredding power to counteract the lack of kiting power and short range of his attacks.  
3.  Galio: Passive changed to convert 60% of MR into AP. With MR getting more expensive and Galio having difficulties with AD champions I'd like to see him getting more oomph from his passive to keep gold on mr to AP gained ratios consistent with S2.  
4. Hecarim: Remove the damage limitation on his Q to minions and monsters. He is already one the worst duelists early game and  clear speed / safety is lackluster. Base Mspd getting buffed hurt his passive and made his clear even worse especially with boots no longer being a starting item for junglers.  
5, Janna: Zephyr Ap ration buffed to .7 Ap and changes to passive movement speed reverted. She is a really cool, dynamic champion with a lot of strength versus AOE which is very prevalent in meta. AP is more useful and easier to itemize on support.  
6, Kennen: Attack ranged returned to 575 from 550. He is a really cool champ and we never see him after this slight change. Giving him back the ability to out range Darius/jayce would make him a much more viable pick for top lane.  
7. Nautilus: Revert Titan's Wrath damage nerf (+5 more damage per rank) to boost clear speed with buffed jungle health.  
8, Skarner: Crystalline Exoskeleton CD changed to 16 seconds. Inescapable ult was already ditched but the shield nerf seemed to really hurt his ability to clear the jungle without taking massive amounts of damage.

Support in lobby:
You only voulnteer to support if someone types adc, if not then ask if anybody mains adc, If noone does,
let someone else support, because there's nothing worse than supporting someone who can't play.

Which support should I pick?:
It depends, you should adapt in this order Their support&gt;Your adc&gt;Their adc
Why this order?You shouldn't primarly adapt to their adc because he will care with creeps mainly, BUT Their support's eyes will be always on you.
And don't get me wrong, I don't suggest getting a Soraka to vayne just cause you counter their support.
Remeber this aswell when picking support Burst &gt; Sustain &gt; Poke &gt; Burst

Masteries, runes?
There are several combinations that are a bit off traditional meta.
Trading/poking much? don't be afraid to get 11 points in defense.
Runnin on slow champs or someone who should outrun them? MS quints
Their jungle will gank 24/7? Gold/10 masteries runes quints everytinhg so you'll have money to ward
You are with zyra lulu lux or sona? get some scaling ap runes, maybe ap quints and burst and get half of their hp without adc in 1 combo

Okey game has started what do i buy?
There are several ways to start/early items.
faerie charm or bead are pretty basic for me, after that If i want bush/jungle presence then I get a pink 2 wards and 2 hp pots
if not and afraid of their jungler then 4 wards and 1 pot
(except in the case of sona, 2 mana then)
Get charm or pen depending on how much sustain you have.
my preference-&gt; bead-&gt;tresh, leona, nautilus charm-&gt;everyone else

You are in lane, what do you HAVE to do:
You always make an impact on the game, have presence, you can't just sit in the bush and fap to lolhentai or whatever.
GO POKE MAKE THEM AFRAID OF YOU but of course being reckless is bad, you always should know when to go and when not.

1st back what should I get?:
philo stone is standard for most of the champs who depends on mana, and good gp/10 if you are afraid of jungler.
If you are one of those all in monsters like thresh, or leona, consider getting an early dorans shield if doing well, or an early sightstone
if you are not doing that well.

Wards, How many?:
As much as you can afford, but don't overspend your money, it's enough for you to see their jungler once, and you can keep track
of where he is in the next 1 min for sure.Pinks?You can make them more afraid of you and less likely to go all in since they will expect your jungler to come.

What is your role in a teamfight?:
This is hard to explain because you have so many duties and it varies which one has priority based on your team their team and on who's fed and on who are you.
So I won't explain this.

Some tips that may help you:
Always keep track of timers, blue red drake, everything.
Buy a ward, save a life.
Captain boots are great!
EVERYTHING IS YOUR FAULT!
learn this and you will get better actually

1349239913.0,51,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,10uz4x,"Let's talk about Twitch, baby",migukin,59,8,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/10uz4x/lets_talk_about_twitch_baby/,"I've been running Twitch ADC a LOT for the past few weeks.  Sometimes people give me crap for it, but when I carry they stop.  Recently I've been experimenting with different weird builds on him which have had mixed results.  

I think Twitch is a VERY viable ADC.  Everybody says he's bad but I don't get it.  Anybody who doesn't think he's good, I encourage you to try this build (don't just say it sucks, just try it... and if you have a different way I'll try yours too).

First off, start with expunge (E) and max it first.  Max Q second.  W at level 4 and last.  Ult when available.  I haven't really decided which support I like best for Twitch yet, but Taric is definitely a sick combo.  Nunu is pretty great for early trading.  Really I think every support is good with maybe Soraka being outclassed as I don't usually have mana issues.

Early game try to just farm and play passive.  Once you hit level 4 you can start trading a little.  I usually enter a bush, immediately invis, get in a good position, hit W, pop 3 or 4 shots (no more than 4) walk away and expunge.  If your support has some sort of hard engage, you can expunge and keep attacking and it's a kill.  The true damage keeps going even after expunging, I've gotten many kills well after they've retreated and the suspense is always pretty fun :o


**Build:**

(I'd first like to note, standard ADC build is still great on Twitch, just I like building him this way)

  Start a Doran or 2.  

I ALWAYS rush Black Cleaver.

Zeal

Executioner's Calling

Phantom Dancer

IE/Tiamat (depends)

Defensive (usually GA)



This build keeps him strong at mid game and makes the best use of his abilities.  Black Cleaver is stronger on twitch than any other carry in my opinion.  With any sort of positioning you can reduce the armor of an entire team with his ult, making your top/jungler that much stronger.  The attack speed it gives is good with Twitch for the 6 stack expunge as well.  

Executioner's Calling is already a good item, but again moreso on Twitch due to its on hit effect, which will again affect the whole team.  

Tiamat is situational on team comp and honestly probably not usually viable, but if you can ult through a grouped up team (such as catching a team camping a bush off guard)  the damage is INSANE.  For reference from wiki:

   &gt; Twitch's ""Spray and Pray"" can trigger Tiamat on multiple enemies at once, causing the splash damage to scale quadratically. This damage can splash back onto the original target. 

Also makes Twitch an amazing pusher with a surprisingly reliable escape, especially since people will ALWAYS assume you will run towards your own tower (assuming no oracles).

Final thing to note is I play Korean server only (since I live in Korea).  Not sure if relevant, but it's possible Twitch is played more elsewhere.  I've literally never seen him except for me here, outside of 1 person who failed miserably trying to jungle him.

Sorry, no **tl;dr** since I think every point is important.  Basically, tl;dr Twitch is underrated, quite possibly moreso in lower elos than higher (but I think it's important for people to play according to their elo, rather than copy what pros do in tournament settings which is an entirely different game).

Let me know what you think, and don't knock it until you try it!

1339856244.0,47,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,v50ev,Things we could learn from DoTA2 Meta,yarpus,66,19,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/v50ev/things_we_could_learn_from_dota2_meta/,"Hi there! There was a guy who posted an awesome ""guide to watch DoTA2 as LoL player"" which can be found [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/v3dsh/as_promised_my_primer_to_watching_dota_2_for/) This and recent DoTA2 matches which I've seen made me to start thinking about stuff we could learn from people playing this game. I'm obviously waiting for your suggestions. Here are mine.

**Support isn't a champion who heals. He is champion who doesn't care about scalings/experience and can work without farm.** 

* used in the same way as Windrunner, Ashe could be a decent support. Her skillset has tons of utility in form of Slow, Hawkshot and Enchanted Crystal Arrow. She has access to strong early game harrasment thanks to passive. I was thinking about the same role for Varus.

* support Nautilus fits the bill of maximizing utility on bottom lane. If for some reason he is not picked for jungling, it may be good idea to give him a chance there. He has 4 Crowd Control effects maing ganks on bottom lane very easy - while adding up incredible amounts of burst damage.

* we also could consider putting Tanks in support role. Champions like Maokai or Malphite brings much more utility than any known support (except of maybe Janna).

**Physical Carry doesn't need to be ranged. He just has to be capable of dealing lots of damage.**

* same as Anti-Mage is currently dominating DoTA's meta, we might consider to put champions like Fiora or Tryndamere on bottom with support - instead of sending them Jungle/Top. They aren't gonna be countered that easily. They will get so-much-needed babysit. Both of them are capable of dealing with ranged harassment and even have ways to sustain themselves. LoL already knows Double Bruiser bottom lane - why not stretching it a bit more?

*Actually Wickd played Fiora/Janna bottom lane a bit, and from what I remember - he did quite well as long as his opponents knowing what he is going to pick, counterpicked him with stuff like Pantheon/Alistar.*

**Pushing towers wins games**

* DoTA makes a great use of champions capable of pushing creep waves in an instant - with the best example of Leshrac. Early towers means early global gold advantage for your team. Pushing towers is currently an important problem in League of Legends, especially if opposing team manages to turtle up under one.

- AP Champions like Ziggs, Mordekaiser, Twisted Fate are capable of pushing lanes extremally fast.

**Roamers are still awesome**

* we might consider running AD Carry/Support mid lane. Why? Because most of supports are pretty awesome at ganking! As someone who plays lots of both Support and Jungle Alistar - I've learned to love Ali's ganking potential. Support at mid-lane would be capable of warding all the important spots on map, gank together with his jungler (or let him focus at farming dem golemz). Alistar who has two Gold per 10 Items and boots of mobility is a true terror for everyone. Same to less extent goes to Taric, Leona and Janna (she's surprisingly good at ganking stuff).

As always, I'm open to suggestions.

For those of you who haven't been on the internet very long, the title is meant to be more than a little sarcastic :p

A bit more seriously, I went from Silver 4 to Platinum  so far this season, learning a lot along the way, and would like to share some of those things.


* 1. Attitude is the most important thing. I like to keep track of helpful posts I find on this reddit about improving as a player, but one of the things that I never see mentioned is attitude. Personally, this was the most important factor in achieving the success that I have so far. Learning to be positive in toxicly negative situations, as well as humble in ""Freelo"" games is a necessary element in making comebacks/not throwing. What's more, **if you ever want to get out of ""EloHell,"" you can't believe that it exists**.

For example, I am a support main, but one game where I was jungling the other team went for a late invade. Long story short, I found myself starting off the game with 2 deaths, no flash, and no blue buff as Nautilus, with a Fiora as our top laner (not someone I expect much from). Every single lane was losing early, and we started off 0-6, with everyone being behind level and cs. However, we kept calm, and waited for them to make a mistake. Sure enough, they 2-man dived Fiora top while I was waiting in the wings, giving us 2 kills for none. We eventually came back to win. The mentality you need to have in the games where all hope is lost is that **everyone is a noob if you let them be one, and every team will throw given the chance**. People with giant leads want to make giant plays, which leads them to make foolish decisions, learning how to bait out towerdives, chases, etc. is how you can make your team relevant again in ""blowout"" games.

On the other hand, I had a game as Morg mid where we got 5 kills, multiple flashes, and blue on the invade, leading us on to a 9-0 + dragon start. We got cocky, and threw hard (fortunately they threw back, and we won in 50 minutes). I've lost games where we were up 17-1 with 5 towers and 2 dragons because of one simple rule: **good items can't replace good play**. When you get a giant lead it becomes tempting to mess around, get lots of kills, max out your build, and get a crazy good KDA. The problem with this mindset is that it doesn't take into account any part of the enemy team. **Throwing starts when you only take into account what you can do, ignoring what your enemy can do, and ends when you think only about what they can do, not what you can do** (e.g. ""gg vayne fed, nice throw cait"").

As a last note on this subject, don't EVER argue with teammates during the game- it negatively impacts your performance, their performance, and the performance of everyone on your team who has to listen (and if you do it in all chat, it will boost the morale of the enemy team. Don't think so? What's your reaction when you see the other team flaming each other in allchat?). Trying to tell people how to play generally isn't a good idea either, unless they are asking for help even the best advice will usually be taken the wrong way. **Solo Queue is where you improve yourself, not the random people you get paired with, energy that you use to think about their mistakes (whether you bring them up or not) is energy that you aren't using to think about your mistakes.** That being said, sometimes criticism (usually not the constructive kind either) from your teammates can help you see what you're doing wrong (and sometimes they're completely off their rocker). If you can use the criticism they give you productively, instead of getting mad over it, you will do well in Solo Queue. I go into matches assuming that my team is going to be disagreeable (until they prove otherwise, sometimes they do this as soon as champ select), and take every caution to be polite and helpful, and trust me, it makes a huge difference, both in learning from my mistakes and creating a more cooperative team.

It may not be something you feel like putting effort into, but **if you want something you've never had, you have to do things you've never done**- changing the attitude that you bring to the game is one of those things.


* 2. Study the game, don't just play it. This is the 21st century, and information is everywhere. Keeping up with the curve means you need to learn from others, not just your own experiences. Streams, wikis, advice videos, guides, reddit, lolking, and other resources (too numerable to mention) are essential to understanding the game; figure out what works for *you,* and always be on the lookout for more sources. What's more, I highly suggest keeping a list of resources you find particularly helpful (i.e. instead of liking an article and telling yourself you'll remember it, copy the link into a word doc (with a couple words to remind yourself what it's about) and keep a library of these resources  to remind yourself about the important ideas from them, and easy access should you want to re-examine them.

Big streamers are big for a reason (usually because they are on a team), and they are a good place to start watching high level play. However, my favorite streamers are guys who generally have small audiences. Take the time to look through the Twitch listing all/most of the way, and try out smaller guys sometimes. You will find some you like, and some you don't, but one very nice thing about all streamers with small audiences (that I've seen) is that you can ask any/all questions you have and expect an answer. One streamer I like that generally has &lt;100 viewers even asks his audience for questions so that he can kill time between ques!

Never latch on to any strategy/build/item/champion/comp etc. as something definite. People are always learning more about both the game and the current meta, and Riot is constantly updating their game. **What is true today may be false tomorrow.** League is a game about adaptation, and if you want to succeed at it you must always be ready to change.

Make it your goal to always be learning something new about the game. For example, every week make yourself play a game or two with a champion you've never played before so that you understand how they work, or find a video about tips &amp; tricks, successful strategies, or a high level game that you notice something in. **The key here is making a goal that you can stick to, and achieving it in a way that is still *enjoyable*.** Believe it or not, learning is something humans naturally enjoy, it's just  the way we go about it that sometimes makes the process unenjoyable. League should be something you enjoy doing, if it isn't, getting to the point where you can enjoy it is your first step on the road to success (see ""Stizza Conv"" on my facebook/twitter).

* 3. Take risks. Don't try to make plays that you know have little to no chance of success, there is almost always a better alternative, and you don't really learn anything from the experience. Trying things you've never done before, and making decisions that help the rest of the team but challenge you personally are the type of risks you want to take. Why? Because these are the types of risks that will help you learn. If you ""can't carry hard enough"" for your ""noob feeder team,"" wouldn't you like to learn more so that you can? You can't change the types of teams you get, but you can change your performance and behavior, so focus on those.

Diving into the entire enemy team at baron pit while its till at half health is not a risk, it's suicide. Letting someone lower on the pick order take your mid even after the Kat who did last game went 1/8/0 is. Taking Baron without any form of vision control (oracles/pinks or greens surrounding) is not a risk, it's being lazy. Wait until baron gets below 2k to try to steal it, or let the support ward around before starting baron. If they don't have wards, have them stand in the river bush as a lookout. Learn the difference between making a decision hastily (foolish) and hesitating to follow a decision (also foolish), disciplining yourself to make good decisions and not hesitate to follow them is a skill that every player regardless of rank needs to work on. 

There isn't much I can talk about specifically in this area, risk-taking is just something you have to practice. When you practice it, **expect to fail hard and fail a lot**. Odds are you will, and if you don't then you have something to be happy about. **The reason why risk taking is worth it in the long run is because it gets you *doing* more: thinking more, learning more, firing brain cells more.** It puts you in new situations that make you do unexpected things, which may not be successful themselves, but allow you to learn more which helps you succeed in the long run.

I could talk more about stuff that I've learned that I think is important, and if you guys like this I may, but this is pretty honkin long and I'm tired of writing for the moment.

There are plenty of guides for how to play *as* champions, but there aren't that many guides on how to play *against* champions.  I'm starting this series (with plenty of room to guest post, since I definitely don't know all the champs =P) as a way to provide a basic primer on facing off against each champion.  I'll be planning on having one of these a week, probably for the rest of my life at the rate Riot is releasing champs.  Content will be reposted on [Summoner Academy](www.summoneracademy.com) within a day or so.

**Riven - The Exile**

[Abilities and Stats](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Riven), from the LoL Wiki.

* **Potential Roles**: Melee AD Carry, Tanky DPS, AD caster, gank-oriented AD jungler
* **Lanes**: Top, jungle
* **Common item choices**: Doran's Blade (stacking), Ninja Tabi/Merc Treads, Brutalizer, Bloodthirster, Guardian Angel, Frozen Mallet
* **Things to know**: Lots of short-range AOE CC, very strong early game, combo and passive does (ahem) tons of damage, very mobile, ult gives range and damage increase with big AOE finisher.
* **Beat her with**: safe early play, ranged attacks and targeted abilities, silence/blind/stun, stacking armor
* **Good counter choices**: Kennen, Rumble, Garen, Teemo, Nidalee, Malphite, Cho'Gath, Olaf

**Game Phases**

**Early Game**: Play safe and avoid her combo.  Don't be afraid to fall behind in CS to avoid getting killed.

**Mid Game**: Judge the situation to see if you can start trading with her.  Be very careful about her teamfight presence - she will seriously wreck your carries if given a chance.

**Late Game**: You can burst her down if you focus her hard - her shield becomes less effective against big lategame damage.  If she didn't build survivability, make her your #1 focus to get her away from your carries quickly.

**General Playstyle**

Riven is an excellent top lane choice, as she can play hyper-aggressively early and snowball very hard.  Her combo and passive autoattack steroid give her extreme burst, especially in 1v1 scenarios, and her CC can lock a single target down for the entire chain.  In teamfights, her mobility and shield will allow her to march right up to your squishy carries and demolish them before they know what happened.  Her mobility comes from abilities, which makes slows much less effective - but makes silence that much stronger.

* Riven usually wants to win her lane by level 4.  Take away her early-game dominance by playing very safe and not letting her get you in her combo.
* She's pure AD, so starting Cloth Armor + 5 potions is MANDATORY.  Stacking early armor will win you the lane.
* Her combo is very strong, but she is vulnerable after using her abilities.  After a combo, you have approximately 10 seconds to beat the tar out of her without much recourse (her autoattack without passive stacks isn't that scary, and her Q is always a 13-second cooldown)
* Interrupting Riven's combo with hard CC or a silence will drive her crazy and take away a lot of her laning power.  If you can force her to play passively against you, you've won.
* Riven is a beast under tower, either offensively or defensively.  Her CC will make you eat a lot of hits if you dive her, while her shield and mobility will let her dive you with ease.  Be very careful!
* Her ult CD is 75 / 60 / 45 - that's really short for a big steroid.  It's a 20% bonus AD (!) and a range increase on all attacks for 15 seconds. You do NOT want to fight Riven when she has her ult up - just keep your distance and let it burn itself out.
* Riven is a monster in midgame teamfights - she can use her abilities to quickly get to and lock down the squishy of choice, and crush them with her combo and ult finisher.  Do everything you can to peel her away if you're the support or tank, because a missed combo buys you a lot of time.
* Late game, your damage will surpass Riven's natural tankiness from her shield, so you can focus her down hard in teamfights and prevent her from wreaking havoc on your team.
* As a jungler, Riven's clear time isn't great, but her ganks are excellent.  Look to counterjungle her and ward your lane well, and she'll suffer greatly for lack of farm.

1341853083.0,48,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,wa0bx,Gragas: top lane at large. ,Kraz226,49,1,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/wa0bx/gragas_top_lane_at_large/,"Hear me out, with the recent Gragas buffs I honestly think Gragas could be one of the better top laners in the game at the moment. I'm currently trying out some builds and have found success with almost all of them. His kit is extremely good: sustain with the passive, gap closer/escape that does good damage, a displacement ult for escaping/initiating/disengaging/ganking/etcetera, and a damage reduction/damage steroid for no mana cost (70 free AD at max rank, it may not be Mundo's Masochism, but still damn good).

Masteries 9-21-0, the defensive mastery tree is (IMO) the best out of the three, Indomitable and Veteran Scars help early laning phase immensely since casting spells heals you due to his passive. Get AD in your offensive tree, I know you usually want to build Gragas AP, but fuck that. The AD scaling on his W and E are too good to ignore now that he has better armor to get in people's faces more. Also, the E got a speed buff so that's great. 

Max R -&gt; W -&gt; E -&gt; Q

Taking Q as your last skill and focusing on maxing his W and E first will let you throw your weight around in the middle of a fight. If you don't want to push the lane, don't even bother getting it. 

Starting lane with boots 4 pots, then rushing Philo, Sheen, HoG, and Phage. Sheen procs fucking *hurt* if you can learn to space them out properly. IE: Take a drink, smack the enemy once, wait 2 secs, E into them, smack again, finish with Q and one final proc. Lots of damage, low mana cost, and damage reduction means if they try to fight back you just trade better. 

Build Metagolem, full stop. Gragas scales well with all stats that a standard metagolem build (Trinity, Warmogs, Randuins, Atmas, that sort of thing) gives you, and you can alter the build to counter the enemy team if the need arises. 

During teamfights, just take a drink and proceed not to give a fuck about their damage. 18% damage reduction for 20 seconds is no joke, and with some cooldown reduction it will almost always be up. If your team needs initiation, just dive in and put your fat in their faces, using Randuins or your ult to keep the other team disorganized and frantic. If not, just chill with your front line champs and wait for the opportunity to go in. If the other team is aggressive, sit near your AD carry and dog pile on anyone who tries to jump them, you have the ability to lay down some serious hurt and still fulfill tanking duties at the same time. 

I think Graggy is very viable as an AD based laner with these recent buffs to his health, armor, and E. Since I've been having some success with it so far, I honestly think I'm going to start using it in ranked. I've even jungled with this twice and done well. (Wriggles, Tabis, gank the fuck out of everything and jump over walls with the body slam to avoid ward coverage)

Have fun out there!

**TL;DR** Gragas is beefy and can still deal solid damage while tanking and using his ult to mess up teamfights. Screw AP, go Metagolem top or jungle and wreck shit up by maxing W and E first.

Hey guys,
Diff here again and after that amazing welcome you guys gave me - I just wanted to thank you for making me feel at home &lt;3

I've been working on my next article and I've completed the video version of it. I'm still in the process of completing the written version which should go up tomorrow. I'll be cross-posting that to the main Lol reddit.


I view readers as falling into one of 4 categories.

* Sponges - soak in information and apply it accordingly
* Whiteboards - Memorise everything then forget it shortly
* Blackboards - Memorise everything and keep it.
* Porcupines - Will defend what they have heard/believe regardless of what you throw at them.


Since you guys have been so kind to me and I figured you're all sponges and super-smart, I decided to post this here ahead of schedule and that the video version alone will be sufficient to get serious discussion going :) Enough about me.. time for the topic in question.

### The topic
I was very curious about how effective the damage reduction masteries in the defence tree really were. The masteries in question were Tough Skin and Indomitable. I went ahead and did some math on it and the results/full discussion can be seen in this video: 

http://youtu.be/H8TjNobQ7jk

I'll try and summarise the conclusions in as few words as possible:

&gt; Effective Armor Increase due to these masteries are very high, ranging from 5 to 120 (in most realistic situations) increase depending on what factors you're looking at. I believe that the ""invisible resistance increase"" will win you a lot more trades since minions provide a large source of damage early and negating a significant portion of that means you can trade more often early game.

&gt; The other masteries in the defence tree are also much more desirable than the ones in the offensive tree for AD Bruisers. Due to these reasons, I prefer the 9/21 set up over 21/9 for a vast majority of top laners. 
[9/21/0](http://thefwcentral.com/lol/#&amp;trees=1-3-0-0-4-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-3-3-2-4-3-2-1-0-0-0-2-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0) &gt; [21/9/0](http://thefwcentral.com/lol/#&amp;trees=1-3-0-0-4-0-0-4-1-0-0-1-3-0-3-0-0-0-1-3-0-4-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0)
 

###Points of Discussion

I think there's a lot of potential for discussion with this topic, I'll try to list a few to start things off but you guys will obviously have better and more varied thoughts than me :)

 - Does ""invisible resistance"" have an effect on how aggressive your opponent plays? Can you fool them into thinking you're weaker than you actually are?
 - Does the utility of the defensive masteries outweigh the sheer damage from the offensive masteries?
 - Do you think that you will be using 9/21 over 21/9 due to these results? Why/why not?

-----------

I hope you guys found the article useful. Let's get some discussion going :3

I've been experimenting with her a lot since the recent patch (I like trying to make unpopular and underappreciated champs ""work"") and my impressions have been pretty mixed (keep in mind I'm Gold III so not pro by any means):

- Not a good pure bot lane support. Not a 100-&gt;0 burst-type mage. Don't think I need to elaborate on this. IMO best fits the role of a utility/sort of tanky/sustained damage mage a la Ryze, Morgana, Ori, Rumble, etc. I've played her both top/mid and honestly I think she is a better top champ built somewhat tanky.

- Good in 1v1 trades and kiting. Great mobility, an ok shield, slow &amp; tether makes her kit ideal for that. Against the right matchup (most melee fighters, assassins without silence), she can be strong.

- That said: SQUISHY &amp; LOW RANGE (!), no reliable sustain (the Mantra W buff was a move in the right direction, but still feels meh bc she is fragile to begin with), crappy AA animation. All of it just KILLS much of the supposed strengths of her kit.

- Awful waveclear for a mage-type champ. Only 1 ability can target minions! (I know Mantra E does damage, but there is no reason for Mantra E over Mantra Q for damage purposes) Underwhelming ganks (which is why I think she is not a good mid).

- Requires a lot of itemization to feel impactful. Very reliant on mana/CDR for Q spam. Extremely important to hit your Q in team fights and have Mantra up as often as possible; otherwise you just become a walking cannon minion. 
RoA and Athene's are core imo. Deathcap too. That's a lot of farm and up to that point, she feels weak. She just needs a lot of vital stats to do well (durability, AP, CDR, mana/mana reg). If her W could target minions and some of her base stats buffed (like AD and health) I think she'd be much more potent.

Im used to play tanks champs since I start playing, and I allways have this issue:

When im looking for Armor items, the items and builds are pretty consistent, they all just come handy. Sunfire, Tabi Boots, Iron Solari, Randuins, you could get a lot of Armor items no matter wich role are you playing... but when the enemy team have 2-3 AP champs (lets say Ahri, Cho'gath and Amumu) the thing is not that easy for me.

its just me or almost every Magic Resist item are very, very situational?

Lets start with Negatron Cloak, the first big MagRes item to take in this situations, it's 4 upgrades are Banshee's Vail, Abyssal Scepter, Quicksilver Sash and Spirit Visage. All of them are really situational and don't fit on a lot of champs. Spirit Visage it's great, but with a wasted pasive if you dont have a big self-heal or life steal/spell vamp based champ. QSS is extremly situational and too much focused on the active, and playing bruisers/tanks you wont ever consider it. Abyssal its an AP and more offensive item. At last, Banshee's Veil its the best one, *in general terms"", still, its the one that I see less.
Comparing to Armor, the high-tier armor items are, Thronmail, Sunfire Cape, Randuin' Omen, Frozen Heart. All of them fit on any tanky champ and you can even build all of them in the same game.

I know that Aegis of the Legion is great, but I still feel that there isn't more than 1 god-tier magic resist item for the same champ. 

Someone feel this way, or im just really bad? :)

Sure, it boosts AD carries with AP ratios (e.g., Trist), but it will really boost AP champions who generally have better CC, chase/escape abilities, and AP ratios.

I know the naysayers will automatically bring up the old adage: ""AD carries scale with farm while AP carries scale with levels.""

Your AD mid should get plenty of farm mid. As for your bot lane AP not getting as much XP as their mid-lane AP, it really comes down to how well your AD mid harasses. If he uses his significant harass advantage, he can potentially starve their AP hard. Think of an Ezreal (great mobility with early burst) or Caitlyn (massive auto range and zone with traps) vs. most APs... Yikes.

As for their AD/support bot lane outfarming your AP/Lulu bot lane, you can always put a stronger farm/sustain AP like Morgana, Ahri, Morde, Vlad, Brand, etc. down there. The biggest drawback I can think of is having limited access to blue buff as a mana champ, so it will depend on what side you're on (you'd want to be on purple team for this to work best). The big advantage you have here is gank potential with your jungler as an AP/Lulu lane will have lots of awesome CC with significant burst.

1372499911.0,42,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1haytb,It's a bird! It's a... bear? It's top lane Udyr! (3 miniguides for maximum versatility),GANGBANGARANG,52,10,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1haytb/its_a_bird_its_a_bear_its_top_lane_udyr_3/,"now that the Udyr changes from a couple patches ago have had time to settle in, he's beginning to see a resurgence of play in the jungle. he's still a rare sight top lane in my experience, although he's one of my favorite picks for his versatility and balls-deep playstyle.

there are 3 ways i play Udyr--Tiger bruiser, Phoenix/mixed bruiser, and Phoenix AP. each has its strengths and weaknesses, and i tend to know going into a matchup which route I'm taking and rune/mastery accordingly.

**AP Phoenix**

R = W &gt; E &gt;&gt; Q (save for last)

Marks: **hybrid pen**, magic pen, aspd  
Seals: armor  
Glyphs: mr, mr/lvl, cdr  
Quints: AP

Masteries: literally anything works from full AP to full tank to utility to some mixture of them. tailor to your matchup. 

Summoners: flash or ghost, tele or ignite.

Start: Faeriecharm + ward + pots or flask + ward + pot (recall at 1:22 for an extra pot if you aren't needed to leash)

When to pick: you have a beefy team, need a split pusher, someone who can pressure top at all phases of the game and is very slippery. you have an AD mid and need magic damage. the enemy top laner has weak burst and relies on drawn out engages.

if you're familiar with AP Tryn or my AP Skarner guide, you should have an idea of how this build goes and plays. get an early tear to solve your mana problems, then CDR cap with Nashor's Tooth and Ionian Boots or a Glacial Shroud. abuse your 3.6s cooldown shield, sprint, and nuke to trade, escape, bait, and split push like crazy. avoid teamfights whenever possible and focus on peeling for squishies because you're very vulnerable to burst.

there are two basic ""combos"" to playing AP Udyr: Turtle &gt; (bear) &gt; Phoenix and Phoenix &gt; auto &gt; (bear) &gt; Phoenix. Either prime a shield as you go in to cs/harass or prime a Phoenix and use the first-hit splash to drop two breath attacks on the enemy in rapid succession. use the range of the breath to hit enemies hiding behind their minions and harass without drawing minion aggro. using bear is optional as early on it's a mana drain and sometimes you won't need it to harass.

there are two things about Udyr that it takes time to get a handle on: the 6s delay in between bear stance stuns, and the range of the Phoenix breath. it can be frustrating at first, but once you understand both of those restrictions you'll be a step ahead of your lane opponent.

after you're CDR capped with this build, focus on split pushing and playing keep away. it can be hard to secure kills until you have a few items, so i recommend taking TP to make splitting easier. don't forget to use turtle's life steal to top off during downtime. double breaths really start hurting once you have some AP and you can clear waves and run away incredibly well. CDR is very important on udyr because you can almost double your bear sprint uptime and keep turtle shields up whenever you need them. 

my core build generally looks like:  
Seraph's (tear finishes charging around the time nashor's is completed)  
CDR boots  
Nashor's Tooth

vs heavy AD:  
(Tear optional if you get an early glacial, but still recommended)  
Tabi  
Iceborn Gauntlet
Nashor's

After:  
Lichbane for optimal turret pushing and the MS is nice  
Deathcap if you are balling out of control  
Guinsoo's for dueling and pushing (always 8 stacks)  
Wits End and Twin Shadows vs AP  
Tank items if you just feel too squishy to contribute.

**Bruiser Phoenix/mixed**

Q first, then R &gt; W = Q =E

Marks: **hybrid pen**, magic pen, aspd  
Seals: armor  
Glyphs: mr, mr/lvl, cdr  
Quints: AP, AD

Masteries: 9/21/0 (magic pen if you think you're not gonna level tiger til later, armor pen if you will)

Summoners: Flash or Ghost, Ignite or TP

Start: flask + ward + pot or red elixir/pots vs aggressive lane

When to pick: you want a semi-bruiser with good split push and strong teamfight presence. you want to pressure the lane without snowballing it. you want more versatility than an AP build. the enemy team has lots of slows and hard CC.

this build plays a lot like AP udyr with less focus on CDR and more on being an unstoppable wrecking ball. get in their face and laugh at their puny attempts to run. you still push quickly with Phoenix but you're less of a single minded split machine.

generally I'll pick this into enemies who struggle to farm under the tower and can be bullied out of cs early on. going QRRER for offensive output leaves you without turtle, making this build best when you all-in instead of sustaining through harass. if you're losing early you can level turtle second to stay safer, but if you're snowballing maxing Q really helps keep them down with mixed damage. bear can sometimes be maxed 2nd against highly mobile opponents. if you don't max tiger second, leave it til last. if you do, whether you leave bear or turtle at 3 points should be decided by your needs in teamfights: mobility or durability. 

take ignite if you believe you can pick up a kill early, TP if later split pushing is more important. ghost vs flash on udyr is a matter of clinching a stun for follow up and flashing high impact skillshots vs higher mobility and pressure over time. ghost makes for good all-ins top since you can cross flash distance easily for a follow up stun and it's the same cooldown as ignite. flash is overall the safer spell.

Core:  
boots of swiftness (unless they're very heavily a single damage type)  
Iceborn OR Wits End  
2nd defensive item OR Zephyr

Zephyr is very strong on Phoenix Udyr for the Aspd, mvspd, cdr, and tenacity. especially in conjunction with swifties, you become practically impossible to kite. I'll generally get Iceborn sooner or later since it's another extremely strong pickup.

Later:  
Sunfire, Omen, or Frozen Heart depending on whether you want damage, anti-kite, or dmg reduction + CDR  
Triforce if you're steamrolling and don't have Iceborn  
BoRK to chase down their squishies and escape  
Visage or Hexdrinker or Banshees for MR  
Mallet if you are primarily peeling or chasing

**Bruiser Tiger**

Q = W &gt; E &gt; R (last)

Marks: **armor pen**, AD  
Seals: armor  
Glyphs: mr, mr/lvl  
Quints: AD

Masteries: 9/21/0  
21/9/0 if you're a *fucking man* and want to cheese early

Summoners: Flash or Ghost, Ignite

Start: flask + ward + pot or red elixir/pots vs aggressive lane

When to pick: you want to punish the enemy early and chunk them every time they come to cs. they would have to sacrifice too much damage to build lots of armor. they're ranged and you want to put some points in turtle early to out-sustain. you want to dive their squishies.

Tiger stance got a fairly big overhaul. it's been changed to deal physical damage with a scaling total AD ratio, just like Garen's spin. this means you gain a lot from maxing it first and it's strong even if you build full or nearly full tank. you also deal a bonus 15% of your AD on hit. you do not want hybrid pen runes if you aren't getting Phoenix until late, so i prepare for a tiger game specifically when I'm up against someone like Irelia--short ranged, vulnerable early, easy to gank--or Nidalee--strong poke early, but can't fight head to head and can be caught and killed with bork in midgame.

you need to use the threat of a tiger chunk to determine the flow of your lane. punish them when they cs or chase them off the line and soak their harass with turtle. you're strongest at level 1, and when you max Tiger. unless you're losing hard, never put more than 2-3 points in Turtle until Tiger is maxed. use the bushes to surprise them with bear and then switch to tiger and stutter step to get a couple more hits in. or prime a tiger hit, run out the cooldown, and launch 2 in quick succession before switching to bear to follow up or run. 

force them to facecheck--catching the blue side top laner in the river bush is a classic udyr strategy to double tiger them early. vs very squishy foes you can red elixir and/or ignite to get your ad as high as possible and force a flash or recall or pick up a kill.

Core:  
Tabi, Merc, or Swifties as the situation calls  
optional Doran's shields vs ranged and 1-2 blades if you can't afford cutlass on first back  
BorK

After:  
Hydra for stupid waveclear and stacked lifesteal--including from Turtle  
Brutalizer if you're snowballing hard--Ghostblade to dive/burst and BC if your team is physical heavy  
Hexdrinker/SV vs heavy magic dmg  
Omen/Sunfire/FH/Iceborn vs AD  
LW if they stack armor  
Stark's if you're not doing so hot

As always, feel free to add, argue, etc. in the comments.

We've all had those times where our teammates do mind-numbingly stupid things (Why did the &lt;200 hp Trist jump INTO the roaming Lux with all of her abilities up when she could have just clicked the lantern or walked/jumped away?), and seen/participated in arguments of whose fault it is for a situation gone bad.

""Why didn't you ult!"" ""There was never a good opportunity, you guys need to set things up better!"" ""It doesn't matter what I set up if you don't follow up!""

Today I'll discuss how you can function better as a teammate to help avoid these types of situations.

1. **Low expectations.** Low expectations are the key to success. **If you have low expectations for your teammates you will not take as big of risks, which means the plays you try to make will be more obvious to your team, which means they will follow up more often, making your team more coordinated.** If it is obvious that a fight is winnable if you engage it is much more likely that people will follow up than if it seems risky. Low expectations also help YOU to think better because you will not be dissapointed in your team as much, and you will be pleasantly surprised more, leaving you in a better frame of mind to make decisions.

2. **Get used to pinging.** Whenever you can, ping. Usually it helps to ping 3 times in rapid succession if a you want to get an important message across. When I'm leaving lane (I main support) if I see my adc is staying I will drop one ping telling them to be careful if I think they might be okay (just so they know I'm leaving), but will drop 3 if I think it's a really bad idea to stay (no wards up, jungler mia, wave pushed to their tower, etc.). Similarly, when calling to go for Dragon/Baron/Tower it's good to use a double or triple ping, or when calling to break off from that objective. (Just as a side note, a good rule of thumb for when to break off from Dragon/Baron, should the enemy team try to fight you there, is if it is more than 1/4 HP you should pull out of range where it can damage you. If it is less than 1/4 HP it is usually worth finishing off. Note that this assumes relatively even teamfight potential for both teams, and both junglers having smite available.) Pinging is the fastest way to communicate with your team, and crosses language barriers; **as I've risen in elo one thing I've noticed is that the higher I go, the more pings I hear.**

3. **""You do no damage!""** This is something I hear all the time, and sometimes it's true, the people that your team is relying on to do damage just aren't doing it. It's usually a good idea to give farm/kills to the main damage dealers (ADC and Mid, usually). However, sometimes the people in those positions are just bad, and won't be able to properly utilize the extra gold. As a rule of thumb, the 1-2 players that ARE dealing the most damage (not who has the highest potential) for your team are who you want to give kills and farm to. If the carries aren't good, that means you need to keep continual pressure on the enemy team, and end the game as soon as possible. Bruisers/Assassins (top, jungle, sometimes mid) can do really well midgame, but by the time they notice themselves falling off, it's too late for them to keep carrying. 

4. **Let yourself get carried.** If the other 2 lanes are winning then there is pressure on your lane opponent(s) to start making big plays. Expect the jungler to be coming as well, because if he can't do anything to help the other 2 lanes, he has nothing better to do than camp you. If you start taking risks trying to make plays the chances of things being turned around on you are good, and you can make it much harder for the winning lanes to carry the game. If your lane opponent(s) don't try to make plays, then you have have a definitive edge going into teamfights. If they do try to make plays, you can catch them doing stupid stuff, and the kill potential is higher than if *you* tried to force the action. Moreover, **everyone has poor games, and sometimes it's up to you to *not lose* rather than win.**

5. **Help the stragglers.** No matter how well you are doing laning, and even in early teamfights, you are dependent on your team for help. Take objectives that give global gold as often as possible, and even donate kills (I know this seems to contradict an earlier point, you have to learn the difference (from experience) between someone who is behind and can use a kill to catch up, and someone who is bad and won't use a kill productively) if you are doing really well already. Also, **if someone is behind (i.e. a Nautilus that got counterjungled), realize that they are behind, and can't contribute as much as usual.** If you can, help them get caught up, but don't expect them to be able to fulfill their role as fully as normal, and play accordingly. Going with the example, if Nautilus is behind he's probably going to be more hesitant to engage, so someone else on the team may need to step into that role, at least temporarily. If your carries are behind, it's going to take longer for them to kill things, and they probably need more protection than usual.

6. **Understand each position.** This doesn't mean you have to play each position regularly, but you should know generally how they work/what they do (soooo probably some normal games are in order to practice). Jungling is probably the most important role to understand, because everyone has to deal with the enemy jungler. **When you know what each position wants/fears, you can better work with and against them.**

7. **Farmers and Fighters.** In my experiences, I would say there are two main types of players: the passive ones who sit back and try to fight as little as possible, taking 0 risks, and the ones who live for battle, never backing down from a fight. Think of this as a spectrum, and try to determine where on this spectrum your teammates fall. Understanding this will give you insight into how likely they are to start a fight/follow up/come back in for a kill when low/etc. Sometimes you need to tell people to be more passive/aggressive, but most of the time **you will see better results if you modify your own behavior to work with theirs.**

8. **Positive Attitude.** I don't care if they are the worst (fill in the blank) you've ever seen, telling them that only hurts you, them, and the rest of your team. The team that spends it's time/energy fighting each other performs poorly. They lose even matches, they throw wins, they don't make comebacks. Most toxicity dies if you ignore it, so if someone says you are the worst (fill in the blank) they've ever seen, ignore them, and if they keep going with negative comments, use the mute button, it's there for a reason. I personally find it helpful to keep note cards with various things written on them by my computer when I play, so if this is something you struggle with write on a note card ""Don't wrestle with a pig. You just get muddy and the pig likes it."" Given the League community's current reputation, it's safe to assume that if something you say could be construed negatively, it will be, so take extra precautions when you type, and don't hesitate to apologize if something comes across the wrong way. Finally, **one very handy way to *prevent* conflicts from happening is to create a fun, jovial atmosphere from the start. &lt;3s, gjs, tys, wps, it's fines, and *well-mannered* taunts aimed at the enemy team do much more for your team than you would imagine to keep a team on the right track, which ultimately leads to the victory.**

9. **TeamWithPlan &gt; TeamWithoutPlan.** This is the main reason why pinging helps so much, but anything that gives your team a clear objective to follow will make you function more cohesively. Communicating about team [comps] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fa711/composition_analysis_next_level_solo_queing/), and planning [invades] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1f8845/the_solo_que_invade_70_success_rate_1_failure_rate/) are some  other good ways to get your team to focus on something easily. As much as everyone is quick to point out that people scream ""gg"" after first blood and other losses, the opposite is also true, even if you can't see it in the chat. Every time your team wins a fight, takes on objective, prevents a death, etc. their faith in each other and their confidence increases, leading to more calls, more pressure, etc. If your team doesn't have a plan, they are disorganized, so don't be afraid to make a call (e.g. ""push mid before they res""). At the same time, **its better to have 5 people follow a bad call than 3 people to follow a good call,** so make sure people come with you to push mid before you put yourself at risk, and don't contradict a call that has already been made unless it is total suicide-- the confusion will be highly detrimental.

10. **Whenever you have to choose, your first instinct should be to help your teammates.** There's a gank coming at your mid and you just started wraiths? Teammates&gt;Wraiths. Their Zed just ulted your adc and you want to go dive theirs? Since they are already on your ad carry, chances are you won't be able to kill their ad carry as fast as your will die, and your best chance is to help your adc by peeling that Zed off. The more you help your teammates the less their mistakes will affect the team, as well as putting you in situations where you will make less mistakes. Just remember the lifeguard's rule when helping teammates: **if there is serious danger to yourself, it's best to just let them go.** Better to go 0-1 than 0-2.

I like to play Warick very much but i dont really know how he fits in s3 meta. So i've tried playing him like in s2 (wits, visage, forzen heart, wriggles) with mixed results. 

I was wondering if some of you guys figured out how to build Warwick (both solo and jungle) recently? 

Also, I think Warwick can solo baron quite early in the game. I did it at 28 min (level 18 ww, with wriggles, spirit of lizard, wits end and BotRK and blue buff) but I think he can do it much earlier. I'm testing it right now but I was wondering if someone figured it out? (like the 15 min duo baron with a Nunu maxing q and cdr ala GamersLegends)

1362487073.0,42,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,19pc6k,Diana Jungle is underated,barnzy12,55,13,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/19pc6k/diana_jungle_is_underated/,"Alright! Clue is in the title.
I think that Diana jungle is under-rated and under played.

I have been playing Diana in the jungle recently and holy alistar (get it? Because he's a cow.) it is fun, I may play low league ranked but either way it is a way to carry a game.

I was playing Xin Zhao jungle a lot before his nerf and yes, he could carry games but unfortunatly didn't make that much of an impact on the late game, his early game was amazing but as the game went along I saw the champion regress.

Then I thought, ""People are playing Xin Zhao more and more because of his amazing strength in the jungle early game, so I need to pick a jungle that can stop that and possibly him in his jungle."" So I thought about the obvious jungles that weren't being played. i.e. Skarner, but then remembered what someone said ""DON'T FEED DIANA!"" Before Diana had her nerf a while back she was played in jungle a bit. I never really thought it was that strong, mainly because I warded my lane so she could never gank, but it seems since she was nerfed she has been forgotten (In Jungle).

I would say, so far I have played 9 games with Diana jungle, here are my current stats from LoLKing:
Kills - 9.7
Deaths - 2.4
Assists - 18.3
Creeps - 97.1

Now I have been following my usual jungle style, gank early get lanes ahead and then farm to level 6. If a lane needs help, I run off to help.
But the goal with Diana is to get to level 6 and 2/3 kills as fast as you can because you can then get your jump, but also the 2 kills basically gets the nball rolling, I know it's not good stealing lanes kills, but lower league it doesn't matter and 90% of the time you will snowball hard, also to keep the laning phase going for as long as possible, because the longer the opponents are in lane, the more you can gank. Much like Warwick, but give your lanes support by poking every now and again, trying to waste the opponents summoner spells. 

Diana's Kit is by far the most aggressive kit I know for jungle once you are level 6. Because you simply W &gt; Q (Hit) &gt; R &gt; E &gt; R &gt; Q.
By then either you are dead or they are, but by doing this it is a lot of burst and if you can get this rotation off on an adc/support. 75% of the time they will die.

Late game I have been looking at this a lot and it seems that if your top is tanky enough e.g. Raid Boss Garen/Shen/Darius. Then you will be fine, if your top is quite squishy then you shouldn't pick Diana and go for a more tanky Champion.

I think that this is the Jungle to learn if you are low league trying to get out of the ""League Hell"" to try and get into Gold/Plat, because she is stupidly strong, easy to snowball, helps all lanes and with a bit of IQ, can be very, very strong.

The last thing I want to say is that if you are first pick and you pick Diana, the enemy get easily over-excited and pick a mid champion because they think you are going mid, so then your team can counter them quite easily. (If they have a brain.) Counter logic, it's my favorite! :D

i read it in official LoL reddit and im sure many did like me. Well, I was supposed to test it myself. And this Build is fantastic. I'm talking about the ""Burning Bush Zyra"" a riot'er got and someone posted on reddit.

- SotEL
- Banner of Command
- Liandry's
- Rylais

So what is this build about? - It's about your plants. You focus on outdamage the enemy with ur two plants. BoC gives 15% more DMG to your minions - but even more important: to your plants! SotEL procs with plant damage too. Every plant hit = true damage.

In the second game between NaJin Sword and MVP Blue, MVP Blue's Jungler ChuNyang started Elixir of Fortitude on Jarvan. Now personally, I had never seen this start, and in the particular game I'm talking about it did not have much of an impact.

However, the casters both talked about how InSec occasionally does a similar build when he jungles Zed.

Having never seen this build and having not seen it used to its full potential, I would be curious to hear what other people's thoughts on the build are. If anybody has any clips of InSec using this build and having it have an impact, I would be really curious to see a VOD.

I guess that if you buy Fort Pot at the start, you gain a lot of presence in early engagements with the other team. You wind up trading faster and more efficient clears for the ability to fight the other team better. I would be curious to hear about other advantages or disadvantages that people can think of in relation to this start.

I certainly wouldn't recommend doing this in Solo Queue as ChuNyang couldn't even secure his blue buff (he started red buff) without help from his mid laner.

While this discovery sparked the idea here are some other reasons why I am considering using him:

1. Maxing q first will give you a huge presence in lane, while whittling down the enemy adc
1. He reduces taric to nothing more than a heal machine, because he can zone him out and eat stuns.
1. R will give you assists from across the map and make ganks easier on your jungler.

I was playing Riven helping jungle Alistar clear wolves when I accidentally stole some exp from the big wolf. He then proceeded to gank top lane after finishing blue buff, and by the time he got there (he went through tri-brush to cut Darius off) I had almost reached level 2, and was able to hit it after a single minion wave thanks to the extra experience I got from the wolf, well before the enemy Darius was able to reach level 2. This allowed me to get my stun which greatly facilitated the gank thanks to the increased burst and CC it provided.


Now this was accidental, but I was wondering if it would be wise to do  intentionally if the jungler was planning to gank at level 2. If the jungler wanted to gank mid, then mid would be the one to steal the exp instead.


Some notes:

* Leeching the big wraith does not slow down the jungler reaching level 2 at all since he gets it after blue's exp gain alone.

* Losing the exp could potentially hurt the jungler later on from reaching other levels where the amount might make the difference. In this case they could perhaps help the laner push to the turret after the gank so that the enemy laner loses experience and returns to lane level 1 with no minions. In the least the jungler would make up a bit of the difference they lost from the wolf.

I think there's going to be so much changing over the next few weeks that focusing on specific champions might be pointless. Particularly abusive cases are almost certain to be removed. Instead, let's try and talk about what new overall strategies might change (e.g, viability of double jungle. Letting support take more cs to get some of the good support items. ect), and how each archtype will change (e.g., will ranged carries go for a 'Hurricane' build most of the time? Ever? Or will single-target DPS builds still dominate.

Will builds of Black Cleaver + Tiamat/Hurricane become common on toplaners, to shred teams for the ADC?

Will melee ADCs start to make more of an appearance? Will assassins be viable in the new jungle (since it's been said they like the higher gold rewards), or will they have too much trouble clearing it? 

Will Kage's Last Breath and Frozen Fist make diving AD carries easier and force them to get defensive items earlier, or more of them? Or will Kage's used on the ADC, Mikael's Crucible, and Mercurial Scimitar make ADCs even safer than before? 

Will supportive-tank-junglers rush Ohmwreaker to make tower dives at every opportunity? Will 2.5s actually be long enough to make a difference late game, where towers mean less anyway? 

How to AD casters do in this season? I think Tiamat will be amazing on them, by adding a new Ratio, having solid AD, and having a solid upgrade. Running the numbers on Renek shows that Tiamat is way more damage than Brutalizer in every situation, and Hydra is way more damage than a Bloodthirster. And that's only considering single-target.

Who builds Manamune? Anyone? 

With Distortion boots, Oracles nerf, ward items, and a possibility to teleport to the wraiths from Wraith Collar - will teleport become common? 

What about barrier? Where is that going to fit in? Teams that plan to tower-dive early? Or are scared that they'll be getting dived? How will it compete with Heal? 

There's some questions we can think about, but I'm sure you guys can think of other interesting things. There's too much focus on individual characters (which are up for wild change), and not enough on how whole systems and dynamics might be altered.

1340388000.0,37,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,vg1sn,Jungle Fiddlesticks or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Grail,GameGuruTB,43,6,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/vg1sn/jungle_fiddlesticks_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/,"**Big wall'o'text, but I encourage a full read to anyone looking to make jungle fiddle much better and more viable than how he is traditionally built.** 

I've been maining the role of jungler for a while now, and Fiddlesticks has recently shot back up into my most used jungler picks. The main reason for this is that after some experimentation, I found there is a rather elegant solution to one of Fiddle's two main weaknesses, his reliance on blue. It's the exact solution I've been adopting on any mid mage I play that is restricted by mana and cooldowns.

Okay so, everyone who jungles fiddle knows that the standard opening of Amp tome + 1 mana pot, into Kage's pick, Boots, and into Zhonya's leaves fiddle with a major weakness. Without Blue, he runs out of mana really, really fast. Consider then, delaying your Zhonya's by a mere 890 gold and getting a Chalice of Harmony after your Kage's Pick + boots 1.

Yes, chalice does nothing to enhance your damage directly, but the benefit from chalice *far, far outweighs* the deficit of setting back your hourglass by 890 gold. This benefit being, complete non-reliance on blue buff. With Fiddle's typical reliance on Blue, it means at best you're taking all the Blues your mid could be getting, at worst it means the enemy has taken your blue and you really have to suffer through fiddle's high mana costs.

Chalice gives him enough regen to be able to clear camps and gank without having to worry about running out of mana or having to buy mana potions. This means that if the enemy is stealing your blue, it's not nearly as much of a big deal as it was with traditional jungle fiddle. If they aren't stealing it, you can now gift your blue buffs to your mid laner, further providing an advantage.

The Pick+Chalice opening also provides a pretty good late game solution to Fiddle's other main drawback, which is the fact that his main source of damage, Drain, can be interrupted. Pick and Chalice nicely build into Deathfire Grasp OR Morello's Evil Tome, and Athene's Unholy Grail. If Fiddle tries to use his Wind+Fear+Drain combo on someone, and the drain gets interrupted, he just sort of has to wait until his drain comes off cooldown. ~40% Cooldown Reduction from a DFG+Grail combo and masteries means that not only can he restart drain if it gets interrupted much quicker, but his long cooldowns on Fear, Dark Wind, and Crowstorm are all that much lower too.

My build generally on Fiddle has ended up looking relatively like this lately, and it has been working very, very nicely.

Start: Amplifying Tome + 1 Mana Pot

Early core: Kage's Lucky Pick &gt; Boots 1 &gt; Chalice of Harmony &gt; Sorceror's Shoes

Mid game goals: Zhonya's Hourglass, Rabadon's Deathcap

Late game items: Athene's Unholy Grail, Deathfire Grasp, Void Staff, all built as needed.

**TL;DR: Making your first few items Kage's Pick, Boots, and Chalice is a great way to relieve Fiddle of his blue reliance and makes him a much safer pick.**

*As an aside, I have been picking DFG over Evil Tome as a Kage's upgrade since the regen from the Unholy Grail is enough regen most of the time. Plus, that DFG active gives Fiddle some more nuking power and DFG gives 80 AP since it was changed.*

EDIT: Also, with fiddle's passive, Sorceror's Shoes, and Magic Pen reds, Fiddle gets 30 magic penetration and 10 MR reduction. This allows him to be doing basically True Damage to jungle creeps and high damage to the low MR enemy champions early on.

1370299583.0,38,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1fm2nd,Somebody Poisoned the Mana Hole: Mana conservation for dummies,BlueNoseReindeer,48,10,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1fm2nd/somebody_poisoned_the_mana_hole_mana_conservation/,"I feel like this is a skill most players have down by the time they are Gold 1-2, but everyone forgets about it sometimes.

First off, no two heroes are alike, and you have to get used to the mana usage of each of them differently. What's more, this article isn't going to take into account things like Kassadin's mana restoration on each auto-attack, or Cassiopeia's reduced mana cost on successive spell casts, as that information is too highly specified.
tl;dr, here are some basic tips that will have exceptions to them.

* Early on, you **don't want to use your abilities on minions unless you have significantly stronger pushing power, or you need to clear a push faster.** For example, if a Lux is going into a Ryze, using her E to push waves will force him to miss out on cs, or use much more mana than she did to get that cs, so it's worth it for her to use abilities on minions. However, a Lux going against a Malzahar will have to clear quickly just to prevent being pushed.

* Look for opportunities to **have your cake and eat it too.** If you are Lux, try to get Es off when you can hit multiple minions and the champion, which means waiting for them to misstep. Simply put, you spend the same amount of mana while doing more with it.

* Autoattacks are highly underrated at low elos. **Early autoattacks are very powerful even for APs, and are an essential form of harassment in lane.** While this is obvious for characters such as Lux and Ziggs, it is true for champions that don't have extra damage linked to their autoattacks (this is particularly true if your opponent is using MR runes/masteries). 

* Going along with the previous point, avoid situations that will put you at 1% health and 90% mana. Don't go in for a trade trying to get autos on them just because its free damage, make sure you can do so without taking damage first. Among other things, this means remembering that minions will attack you based on the proximity of the enemy champion to their minions (not your proximity to their minions). If you lose a significant trade you have to use your abilities more defensively for awhile, which means you won't be getting the most for your mana. As a rule of thumb, **you want your mana and hp bars to be within 20% (of their max) of each other.**

* When you are just harassing, it's usually best to **only use the most mana-efficient ability.** This will be the ability that you put the most skill points in early, because the mana cost will go up slightly, but the damage will go up significantly. Exceptions to this rule would be CC abilities on champions that get more from autoattacks, such as Darius. Using hook/slow combo will start stacking bleeds and allow you to get lots of autos off.

* Maximize ability use. If you have a multi-target ability, you should probably be hitting multiple targets with it. Sona's heal will always heal her +1, so if your adc needs a heal and you are full health, go in for a trade (assuming it's relatively safe) because you can essentially heal yourself for free. Also, don't use an ability (skillshots in particular) just because you have it, have confidence the shot will do something productive before you decide to invest in it. This point more or less relates back to knowing how your champion works specifically.

*  Unless you have Kha'Zix or someone else that you **know** you can all-in with early, you usually don't want to spend a ton of mana then. Going off of the  previous point, abilities get more mana-efficient with level, so don't splurge with your mana until level 4-5 at least.

* Tear vs. Chalice vs. RoA. Every character is different, but in general the MR and infinite mana from **chalice is handy for people you want to be trading with** (usually having some form of sustain, including shields). **Tear is for people who get a lot from the stacks,** and can stack it quickly (just an observation, it's usually for late-game characters, such as Ryze, Singed, and Karthus). RoA works very well with Tear on a lot of champions, but is often the sole sustain item for APs that don't use tons of mana (Cho'gath, Diana, Fizz). You usually only want to get one of these items (RoA/Seraph's on some champions being the exception), and most important thing in deciding which one to go is how it fits into the rest of your build.

1361303212.0,40,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,18u3j2,AP top lane Spindamere: sleeper OP or just a gimmick? (miniguide + discussion),GANGBANGARANG,48,8,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/18u3j2/ap_top_lane_spindamere_sleeper_op_or_just_a/,"I've been seeing lots of AP top lane Tryndamere these days in solo queue so I've taken him for a spin to get a feel for the playstyle and want to share my findings. Spoiler alert: it's surprisingly effective.

AP Tryn fills a similar niche to Singed or Khazix in terms of using his obscene waveclear to control the flow of the lane and pressure his opponent far beyond what most champions would consider safe. By building high cdr and AP, he can effortlessly melt waves and harass with Spinning Slash, while using Bloodlust to stay topped off for free. He has a 1.0 ratio (and 1.2 bonus AD) on his spin and a 1.5 ratio on his heal, meaning hundreds of hp a pop with just a little AP.

First, the bad news: you'll need a special runepage for him. A standard AP page takes mpen reds but since you have zero magic damage in your kit, you'll need to take arpen reds instead to boost your auto and spin damage. Remember to point and laugh at anyone who builds mr against you!  
Arpen reds/armor yellows/mr blues/AP quints.

For masteries, you can go 21/9/0 in most cases, picking up 4% cdr, 8% arpen, flat ad and ap, spellsword, and 2 points in flat arpen. 9/21/0 is also viable since defense tree is op, but your goal is to dominate your lane so only go defensive if it's a hard matchup (vs Teemo for instance). A 16/14/0 setup to get the flat AP in offense and Block in defense can be a good balance against pesky ranged champions.

Skill order is R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; W. You can safely skip leveling W until midgame unless you're up against someone like Riven with predictable, high AD ratio burst--or if you're getting help from your jungler and need the slow to move ganks along. In general, the AD and heal on Q are worth leveling up quickly to establish your dominance.

Always keep three things in mind as Tryn: you do more damage lower on health, you gain up to 35% crit as you full your fury bar, and crits reduce the cooldown of Spinning Slash by 2 seconds which is a big deal when you've got it down to 4.8 seconds with cdr. Managing these three interconnected elements can help you judge when it's worth topping off with Q and when you should save it to keep that crit going. Past a couple hundred AP, the bonus heal from fury grows negligible compared to the base amount so you should try to keep your fury up for crit whenever possible.

The best trick I've learned for kicking ass with AP Tryn is to know when to spin *onto* an enemy and when to run into melee range and spin *away*. If you have high Fury, spinning onto them is general smart since crits means more spins that you can use to engage deeper or disengage as you please. Spinning away from them keeps you safe from retaliation and is safer with a missing jungler so you don't spin in and then get caught without an escape. Learn the range for the ability so that you can chunk em every time they move in to cs and laugh as you heal through their pitiful harass. Always avoid prolonged engagements unless you think you can bait a kill out of it.

Items: my core is, without fail, Cdr boots + Nashors for the 39% cdr. Your heal only scales with cdr and AP (and mitigation) and you get unparalleled mobility with spinning slash and a favorable interaction with the crit cooldown function of the ability. You can consider an early Seeker's Armguard vs ad-heavy matchups as it's highly cost efficient and indirectly improves the value of your heal by mitigating incoming damage. Zhonya is a good pickup later on to drop at the tail end of your ult to buy time for another heal or escape. After Nashors/Boots2, you can grab Deathcap or Lichbane: I prefer Cap because it quite simply makes you even better at what you're already great at, but Lich makes you a better duelist and objective taker.   Personally I find that the lack of mpen and having to use Q at suboptimal times makes Lich less powerful than it seems but I'll reserve judgment on that. After, try Guinsoo for more sustained dps and pushing power, Warmogs as a big fuck you to anyone trying to kill you, or Twin Shadows to stay safe while you split. You may need Last Whisper to keep your damage up if they stack armor but I haven't had a chance to test that.

Playstyle-wise your goal is to bully hard, shove freely, and channel Singed as you twirl about the lane with all the grace of Barry Bonds performing ballet. While a free escape and spammable heal make the lane rather forgiving, you're still a melee range fighter and are prone to being outscaled and outdueled. A bad start is very hard to come back from since all you can do is hope to keep up at that point, so don't play him like he's idiot proof. If you take a lead though, you can force their jungler to camp top fruitlessly while the rest of your team thrives. Keep tabs on their jungler and shove &gt; steal camps when he's bot or dead. Your roaming is poor so staying top to keep the pressure up is generally going to be your best course of action.

1345672573.0,37,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,ynt0w,Couple of tips for those of you jungling Rengar ,Kraz226,44,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/ynt0w/couple_of_tips_for_those_of_you_jungling_rengar/,"**CTRL+F FOR TL;DR BELOW** 

I've played him a fair amount on PBE, and despite people thinking he sucks and belongs top lane, he's actually quite good in the jungle. 

*SKILL ORDER*

The main thing is that you actually do not max your Q first. The AD/AS buff on your Q is mediocre despite the good AD scaling, since the cooldown on your Q remains low even at rank one (6 seconds). you really want to max W or E depending on what you currently need to be doing. Should you be ganking and camping lanes? Max E and keep your stacks up so you can use it twice in one gank. Are your lanes not really gankable? Max W, get some GP5 items (Avarice and HoG) and farm as hard you can to prep for late game while warding drag and keeping tabs on buff timers. You really need to make a decision early on between jungle control, and gank monster. Rengar can do well in both roles due to his passive and decent clear speeds. 

*ITEMS* 

Item builds can differ, I don't really suggest maxing Q and getting wriggles, but it can easily work if you want to use it. I've had a lot of success getting CDR and AD. Getting Brutalizer and a vamp scepter can easily carry you through mid game, and neither costs a large amount of gold. Also, be sure to pick up the Bonetooth Necklace early on. It's an extremely good item that doesn't lose many stacks on death, so even if you're dying as long as you're team fighting well you'll get stacks up in no time. It's extremely gold efficient for all the stats it gives at only 6 stacks (25 movement speed, 10 armor pen, 5% cdr). 

* My setup: Armor/5pots &gt; Bonetooth and Vamp Scepter &gt; Tabis and Heart of Gold &gt; Brutalizer and Phage &gt; Zeke's (From here just build what you think is best against enemy team)

I usually try to get Randuins and Maw as my main defensive items. Bonetooth is a must and almost everything else is up to you. Brutalizer/Youmoo's is quite good, but I haven't played many games without it where I found myself missing it greatly so take that as you will. Trinity works, but probably isn't optimal since it's so expensive. For funsies I tried Gunblade, it was *awesome* how well the active/AD/spellvamp synergized with Rengar's kit, but it's pretty pricey for what it does. I want to try it out some more, I think it works well. Also, just about every single type of boot works on Rengar. I've done well with Ionian, Mercs, Tabis, Zerkers, and even Mobility boots. Mercs are usually the ones I stick with, but you can still do well with the others if you know what you're doing. Getting GP5 isn't that high priority on Rengar, unlike most junglers. Since his items don't really have a sky-high cost he can build a HoG along with his Bonetooth and simply farm his way through mid game with out falling behind laners very much. 

*GAMEPLAY TIPS*

* When farming camps, always try to use your empowered Q on buffs and your empowered W on regular camps (wraiths, wolves). The magic damage isn't bad at all when used twice in a row, and you'll take almost no damage at all due to the heal and armor buff you receive.

* When ganking, if you can get in position without using your ult, do so. After using all your abilities (and sometimes burning an enemy summoner like flash or exhaust) you can then follow up with your ult to quickly fill the ferocity meter back up and start your combo all over again. The slow/snare on your E (70% at max rank?!) should not be underestimated, you can keep people almost permaslowed while you and your lane partner beat on them. 

* During teamfights you have to really try to do one of two things: focus their carry or protect yours. Rengar can really destroy most bruisers in the game since he can slow them and his armor pen lets him shred people who usually have a good chunk of armor. 

* Don't rely on your ult to reposition yourself, an enemy oracles will get you destroyed if you're too ambitious with it and get out of position. Just try to follow along with your team's front line/tank and single out targets you know you can either kill or disable for your team to catch up. 

* Rengar can absolutely *maul* anyone he catches alone in the jungle/river. He's a fantastic champ when going against counter junglers (Udyr/Mundo/Shyvana) since he can stick to them easily while buffing his own tankiness at the same time. Ward your jungle entrances and chase down anyone who dares walk around alone. You can easily stack your Bonetooth while getting the enemy jungle behind by doing this. 

* This also applies to enemy mids who like to roam and get kills or farm wraiths (LeBlanc, Fizz, Morde, TF, Gragas). If you know the enemy mid laner is going to try to gank and roam, lay down a ward or two so you can catch them with your own preemptive gank. 

* Rengar's early clear is slow, but once he gets 2-3 ranks in his W it speeds up considerably. Try to let your team know this early on. If you get counter jungled make sure your team knows it and try to ward and catch the enemy jungler in a vulnerable position. 

**TL;DR**

Jungling Rengar? Don't max Q first. Max W if you're just farming, max E if you're ganking all the time. Buy items with a mix of stats like CDR, defense, and AD. Don't get wriggles, *do* get Bonetooth. Either focus carries or peel for yours. You rule small jungle skirmishes, keep jungle entrances warded and leap on anyone you catch out of position. You snowball really hard if you get stacks early, abuse this and keep on the offensive.

After playing her for a while realized that she is Anivia tier in terms of her entire kit.
She does everything that you would want an AP mid to do + more.

She has AP enhanced auto attacks so she can actually win simple trades in lane, plus late game she does more damage than a non-crit AD carry auto attack. It also helps her last hitting a lot. Early game you are doing more damage by getting in an auto or than most other mids do with a one spell and maybe an auto attack, this is of course without you using any mana. She also has one of the best AS scaling in the game, meaning that you can actually make good use of this passive. This also allows you to go AD if you feel like it because she has Kennen's range, A free BF Sword's worth of damage late game, and a very solid attack animation.

She has a powerful, low mana cost, permanent zoning ability that has a great range, is able to check bushes, and provides sustained damage in teamfights. The huge range on this means that you usually won't need to put yourself in too much danger while still being a huge threat to the enemy team.

Next is a AOE nuke that gives your allies a haste, and slows all enemies. Most champions have a single skill that only do one of these things. With Orianna it is not that hard to get all three of these off if you play correctly.

Her last basic skill is a shield with about 1000 range, that deals damage as it makes it's way to the ally, has great AP scaling, and provides free magic resist and armor. If you don't have any allies of course it can be used on yourself to mitigate damage as effectively as Janna.

Her ultimate is an inverse Gragas ultimate with a strong nuke added into it. The range on it is pretty decent so it isn't impossible to consistently set up 3-4 enemies into getting hit by it. It also leads into your Dissonance burst followed by an Attack and maybe a Protect with good ball placement.

All of her damage is aoe, she has damage plus utility on every one of her spells, and she has both constant sustained damage and powerful nukes.

In lanes she is difficult to gank because she has a free ward that can remain in place for as long as she feels like, she has a shield plus an AOE slow/haste, whichever is better for the situation. 

She farms very easily and can outfarm most mid laners even when being zoned. On that note, it is very difficult to zone her because of her large ball range.

Late game she can easily take out Ad carries without even being at risk of counter attack. Attack, Dissonance, Shockwave, Attack, Protect can remove a carry from a fight with ease.

She has great ganks because of her slow, and ult. She can also travel between lanes pretty quickly due to Dissonance. She can easily solo the Blue buff around level 6-7 because her Auto attacks hit so hard and have a great stacking bonus. The Protect makes it so that she doesn't even take that much damage from doing it.

The only two problems anyone can really have with her are:

She is too mana dependent. This is something that I have personally had a bit of trouble with in the past. I used to build Archangel's on her, but now i realize that, like Anivia, all you need is a Chalice and good mana management. It is much better to build damage on her than to rush a Tear and later build it into Archangels, though I can imagine very few situation where this might be viable. I used to max Q on her both before and after the changes, and I have recently started maxing W instead. I have realized that there is no point in maxing the positioning skill when you can do nothing after you have gotten the very important position that you wanted so badly. While her Q doesn't scale in mana cost anymore, it deals a lot less damage, and when you are trying to all-in someone, you are obligated to use Dissonance otherwise you know that you are doing much less damage than you could be. When you max it first you notice that you don't feel very bad about using the positioning skill simply to position your real damage skill, of course applying only to pre-late game. The next reason to max it is because of the fact that you can one-shot the caster minions at level 7. This is something that most champions can't do until they go back and buy a Blasting Wand or something of the sort, and usually they still can even clear until they have a few points in another skill. I used to max Protect last, but the extra shield health is a lot more useful mid game than it is late game. If you have enough skill to use it for damage, then it is balanced out with your Q skill. It also helps in lane because it travels faster than Attack and deals flat damage to every thing it hits. The ability to help your tanks initiate is also an invaluable tool and can be the difference between you saving a teamate with a sliver of health, and them dying because you were able to get the ball into position .5 seconds faster.
Kinda of strange to max Q last because capitalizing on every possible advantage with Orianna is key, but if you can't do something significant when you get the opportunity why even bother?

The next issue with Orianna is that she is a difficult champion to learn and master. I have no argument against this. I personally didn't have much trouble picking up her skills and using them effectively, but i can certainly understand why people would have a lot of trouble with her.
Like Cassiopeia (The champ she is tied for in difficultly) If you aren't landing stuff then you are not doing anything.

If people would really put some serious time into Orianna they would realize that she is a serious threat to any enemy, and works well in almost every reasonable team comp. It helps that she can play any role she want's to. ( jungle isn't viable, but certainly not impossible)

1344374868.0,40,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,xuf7a,Interesting nunu-based teamcomp,mot88,46,6,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/xuf7a/interesting_nunubased_teamcomp/,"Since the recent nunu buffs, I have been thinking a lot about his role as a support.  In that role, both his q and passive go nearly completely wasted, but this could be changed.  If the dual lane were to be in mid instead of bot, nunu could take advantage of his ability to jungle on the wraith camps.

Here is an example comp with this strategy:
1v2 bot lane (im not an expert on 1v2's, but this could be yorick, janna, or cho'gath (?))
2v1 mid (nunu and miss fortune)
Udyr jungle 
Gragas, vlad, or Kennen top (you need an ap with an escape for top)

With this comp, nunu can ward enemy wraiths level 1, steal the enemy big wraith if red is unguarded and get to blue in time to give udyr a no-smite blue buff leash.  Then, nunu can take udyr's first wraith camp (which udyr's often skip) and udyr will be ready for a level 3 double buff gank.  

This strategy allows the team to maximize experience in the super-early game, allows nunu to steal enemy wraith camps in wolves whenever the oppurtunity presents itself, and allows for very strong 2 or 3 man ganks from very early on in the game (mf's passive, nunu's bloodboil, and udyr's bear stance allow for a lot of movement speed, especially if the 2v1 is ap janna).  In addition, nunu is free to roam, because the ad carry can just 1v1 mid. This allows for the potential for a 5-6 minute 2 man dragon (nunu can solo dragon with the right build at level 4).

If nothing goes horribly wrong with this strategy, nunu should be able to  make plays, either by overpowering the lane mid in a 2v1, stealing the enemy jungler's farm, ganking top, and/or getting an early dragon.  This way, the ad will be ahead on xp compared to the enemy ap, the jungler will outfarm the enemy jungler, and nunu will have more gold then the enemy support (but possibly be underleveled) at the expense of an underfarmed bot lane.

tl;dr nunu support is underutilized in bot lane, because if the duo lane is in mid he can steal wraiths.  2 man mid also allows for 3 man ganks on top or bottom.

███ Unconventional Team Composition and  Ideas  ███

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬*Note*▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

Not all of these ideas are mine but maybe have been done before in tournaments or games i have played in. Some of these i have thought of may have been found by someone else before.

If you want to leave a comment, go for it! Comment on my silly grammar mistakes, ideas, team compositions, etc.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Introduction▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**Please do not use these ideas if you're in a solo queue and your team is not willing to corporate - in other words, choosing one of these ideas at their expense. It is recommended to do these either in bots, 5 man scrims or premade ranked.**

Team comps are very important to how the meta works in league and every champion that are picked is also important and every champion picked should fit into the team composition. The champions picked should either improve or fit into the strategy that is chosen. Another note to take is that when you pick a certain team/lane comp, it should be countering or choosing a better comp.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬META▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

▀█▄▌ Push Meta ▐▀█▄
Seriously. People used to say that there is no such thing as a push meta and oooh boy they were wrong. People thought dota 2 had no meta as well. They had, the pushing meta. There was a reason why in Dota 2 bans were pointed at a lot of pushing champs because simply they couldn't withstand against the pushing lanes. Now right now, if you don't understand anything about Dota 2, you would be saying ""But Vertical! Why are you using Dota 2 as an example? It's completely different from League!"".It is in fact different but the reason why i'm talking to you about it is that people want something new. For example, a rising popular high-elo player named Azingy is bringing in new tactics, his reasons. I don't know. But i respect him for attempting to introduce new aspects into league and he's been testing out many metas such as the tri-bot lane. Dota 2 or Valve doesn't instantly remove really OP tactics like how riot pretty much instantly nerfed ""protect the kog'maw"" team composition after it was re-introduced by Dignatas. Dota 2 undeniably more flexibility in team compositions.

The push meta is effective simply because it is hard to be outpushed by a pushing team, possible consisted of people like TF, anivia, Cho Gath, Corki, etc. 


A very good example is a recent game of LGN vs CLG.NA(or Prime) where CLG picked the push meta. LGN had LOADS of problems getting split pushed but thankfully they picked a team composition that somewhat pushes them back a bit. It worked very well for CLG because it doesn't matter if LGN got dragon or anything, CLG just kept on pushing.. and pushing. Here was their picks:
 
ε Top : Olaf (Flash/teleport)

ε Mid : Gragas (Flash/teleport)

ε Jungle : Mundo (Flash/Smite)

ε Bot : Sivir (Flash/teleport)

ε Support : Sona (Flash/promote) 

Notice how 4/5 of are EXTREMELY good pushers?(Except Sona) They would constantly pressure onto a tower. When they had the advantage in pushing a lane, Sona would use promote on the big minion helping them push even faster slowly building up a HUGE minion wave. Sona was probably picked because of how much mobility and a team stun that she provides to the team.



▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Team Compositions▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬


▀█▄▌ AD/Support Mid lane ▐▀█▄

ε Top : Any good top champs

ε Mid : AD

ε Jungle : Any

ε Bot : Can 1v2 or sustain a lot

ε Support : Check Description 


Description : Please note that this team composition will be hard to work with and requires a well coordinated team to do. Also this is listed in team composition because it completely changes the team comp.


This team composition can work because of the overall tactics. I've seen this work in Dota 2 tournaments effectively. This team composition still allows you to keep a strong control over dragon, but now you have a better protection on both red AND blue.
The chances of the enemy counter jungling without dying are dramatically reduced giving the duo mid lane team slightly more advantage. 
AD carry /has/ to go mid because you simply cannot have an AD carry on bot by himself. He will be zoned and killed easily. 
A big disdvantage is that you will be having a possible 1v3 (including enemy jungler) bot if they focus on this weak point. This can be somewhat enhanced if team jungler roams around the bot lane side of the jungle, keeping a close eye on the bot laner.
For support, preferably either traditional support or someone who can stun or cc well. Examples: alistar, janna.


A popular team in Southeast Asia named SAJ uses this and has some good success with it. They had a jungler and what they're doing is that they picked Karthus to lane against Graves &amp; Taric because Karthus can CS safely. While in mid lane it was Ezreal and Leona shutting down a Kassadin who needs quite a bit of farm to be useful.


Good article on it by DrCytoKinesis of Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/tl4ji/duo_lane_mid_strictly_superior_to_bottom_and_the/


""tl;dr Running ad/support mid lane is a strictly better position to run them than anywhere else on the map. They should always be mid. Tri-lane should be used for aggressive games/teams and there is no reason it should not belong in the current meta. It is a direct counter to the current farm-fest meta and it is a miracle that it isn't used. And to clarify, this is for pro-games mostly. Pub's won't be able to coordinate a tri-lane.""

-------

▀█▄▌ (Pratically AOE)Galio/Kayle &amp; Fiddle ▐▀█▄

ε Top : Galio/Kayle

ε Mid : Fiddle

ε Jungle : Preferably AD tanky DPS 

ε Bot : Any AD carry 

ε Support :Preferably that can AOE stun - E.G : Shen, Alistar, Morgana, 

Description : Note* Since Fiddle isn't going to jungle, don't pick him too early in team comps if you're in draft pick in case of counter pick.

A perfect Galio taunt that is followed up by Fiddle can be extremely dangerous. Also while Galio ulted into the enemy team, it will protect fiddle for the 2.5 seconds of taunt. (Fiddle's ult is 5 seconds - he can finish the rest of his ult without getting damaged if he has an hourglass). 
The support preferably should be AOE stun so that galio can follow up. It will also provide easier ganks for fiddlesticks.
Also, it is essential that Galio should go top rather than support bot because he can do a lot of damage if he builds tanky AP rather than building support items. 
Kayle is also a good pick in combination of how he was recently discovered that he was good with Karthus. Kayle shielded him while he did damage amongst a very wide range which fiddle can do as well and that he should. The ult provides him to take less damage but note that he can still be CC'ed in the shield. 

-------

▀█▄▌ Double AP / AP + Support Bot ▐▀█▄

ε Top : Any - but preferably Tanky AP that involves spell vamping - E.G : Vlad, Swain

ε Mid : AD carry that can solo against AD - E.G : Ashe, Varus, Corki, Urgot

ε Jungle : Any - Preferably Tanky AD

ε Bot : Mana AP Carry ( Escapes or something similar ) - E.G: Ahri, Morgana   

ε Support : Soraka, Lulu 

or

ε Bot : Mobility / Manaless AP Carry - E.G: Vladimir, Kennen, Akali, Katarina  

ε Support : Lulu  

Description : This comp allows a bit of change and is similar to the old ""ad mid"" comp. I have tested this comp before with me as Ahri bot with soraka support and an urgot mid. What this comp allows you to do rather than sending the AP mid, we send the AP champion bot and you should pick a good AP champ that can harass and deny the AD carry better than some AD carries can. It provides a much more aggressive lane when you can spam spells with soraka belong your side if you choose soraka as support. Lulu also provides a good support because of the damage boost with AP and also movement speed since it is a risky lane with the distance between the two towers.

When you decide your AP carry, it's optional to pick a champion that allows you to have lots of mobility, even for a short time to get away from ganks (Ahri) but it is recommend to since it is a risky lane. For example, a champion like Morgana could possibly prevent both the AP and Support to safely go back to tower if you are being ganked. Ahri provides mobility, Vladimir can pool to a far distance (not too far), Kennen has lightning rush, etc.

If you're choosing a mana reliant champion, you should choose soraka because of her mana and heal to keep you in lane as long as you want until she dies.
If you're choosing manaless (energy, health, etc) ap carry like Kennen, Lulu is the way to go because you don't need mana and you get the extra health boosts, damage boost and speed.

If you want to run Double AP, you can have someone top as AP that should go into the team composition but that's for you to decide. For example, double WOTA.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1362822557.0,,,True,t3_19xtdg,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/19xtdg/last_years2_i_started_writing_a_list_of_team/,

1. Smite works with her passive.  At lvl 1, smite does 490 damage.  With her passive, she willl get healed for 50 on a short cooldown.  This could be even further amplified with spellvamp quints/utility mastery.

2. Further adding to this, if she gets Spirit of the spectral wraith, she will have 40% spell vamp at level 13.  This will allow her to heal massively, and  thanks to the reduced CD on smite on SOTSW, it will be up frequently

3. Smite can also allow her to give a super-leash for her jungler, or try and steal the enemys jungle.

4. Similar to smite on support blitzcrank, you can SMITEBIND! You can land the easiest bindings by tossing your binding, smiting the minion infront of your enemy for an easy binding.  This will definitely catch your opponent by suprise.

5. Morgana is a fairly passive laner, being more utility based.  Not to say that ignite wont help, but it is not as necesarry on say someone like Khazix or Zed who need to get those kills.

6. Smite also allows for better objective control.  Having 2 smites allows for 2x the effectiveness in securing/stealing baron and dragon.
 
So what do you guys think?  Could this be viable?

~~Edit: I suck at formatting.  Does anyone know how too fix this?~~ Thanks guys

Edit 2: It seems like the consensus is that it would have reduced kill potential, but could be viable.
I have a few questions i that case.
* Would it be good to run 9/0/21 masteries and possibly even spellvamp quints?  

* Since the kill potential is already low, would it be better to be more utility based and get more MS, a lot of extra spellvamp (19% @ lvl 1) etc.? or would going 21/0/9 be better anyways

* A lot of people have mentioned using smite to farm wraiths, therefore outleveling the opponent.  

* Would this be better than smitebinds? Smitebinds would give more kill potential,which was one of the weaknesses of this strategy as you could wittle down the opponent.

* However, if you can't kill him, you are missing out on some great cash.  Which one is better?

Yours is the snowball that will poke the heavens!,GANGBANGARANG,55,14,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/16n5lr/nunu_topmid_burst_the_meta_wide_open_yours_is_the/,"Hyperbolic title aside, I think nunu top has always been a strong pick and the rise of ad casters and bruisers mid has made sending him mid an entirely viable option as well.

**Pros**: Deny farm to your lane opponent  
Incredible targeted poke  
Sustain for days  
Consistent farm-independent utility  
Crazy buff/objective control  
Resilient to burst  
Huge variety of viable build paths  
Can safely donate blue as a mid laner for most of the game  
Extremely strong vs. autoattack-focused champions, but can hold his own against AD and AP casters as well

**Cons**: Low dmg output except for unreliable ult  
No instant escape  
Mana hungry  
Lategame impact is dependent on your adc to make the most use of blood boil

Nunu is a huge lane bully. Built and played properly, you can deny a ton of farm to your lane opponent with the consistent poke from ice blast and sustain from consume. Your goal as Nunu is to control the creep line so you can freeze lane and build visionary stacks on a whim while poking every time they go for a cs. Even long range csers like Kha have trouble with this because blood boil lets you close long distances to hit your snowball.

**Masteries**: 16/14/0, picking up AP/cdr in offense and slow reduction/block in defense. Utility-centric builds are strong on Nunu but do not mesh with my in-your-face early domination playstyle and make you weak to ganks. I would only go utility against a very weak early laner like Nasus top or AP nid mid. If you're in a position to take blue buff OR you want to run Tele/Flash with distortion boots, it's up to you to decide where those points in utility are going to come from. There's no one answer since you need to approach every matchup differently.

**Runes**: Mpen reds (AD/hybrid pen/armor viable but very situational and not recommended)  
Armor yellows (hp/lvl, mp5, mp5/lvl viable vs VERY AP-heavy comps)  
Mr blues (mr/lvl, cdr viable vs AD lane and jungle)  
AP quints (Spellvamp viable vs low to no sustain but very high dmg lanes) 

**Items**: flask/ward/5pot with a focus on mana potions (1/4 or 2/3 vs heavy early harass) in most cases. Flask/2ward/2pot and flask/charm or bead/2pot viable in some situations.

Nunu is all about building to adapt. Triple AD comp? Glacial into Aegis or Banner and finishing with FH will give you your much-needed armor and utility to boot. Getting fucked by slows? Swiftness boots are your friend. Taking lots of poke? Grab Revolver and Visage and h4h4h4h4 back up to full health. Crushing your lane early? Double Doran's Ring and sorc shoes will let you keep the pressure up. Even Banner of Command and Ohmwrecker are great on Nunu simply because he has such a wide variety of stats that work well on him. Striking a good balance is the key to making solo Nunu work. Too much AP and your teamfight potential will be risky at best due to your low range and unreliable ult. Forego it entirely and you'll have practically no presence midgame. You want to be tanky enough to thrive on the frontlines, but dangerous enough that they can't just ignore you. Here's my rundown of stats to help you build Nunu yourself.

God tier: CDR.  
CDR is the single best stat you can get on Nunu. With 40% CDR, you can keep 2 targets blood boiled 80% of the time--perfect if your top lane or jungler scales well with aspd. CDR increases your damage output, pushing power, sustain, and gives you more leeway to use your ult 'imperfectly' (clearing waves, zoning, forcing flash) since you're less restricted by the long cooldown on its lower ranks. Further, since AP and magic pen don't improve Consume's damage output, it's far and away the best stat for baron and dragon control. An early glacial will let you solo dragon as soon as you can buy it; Glacial + Revolver + a second source of CDR (blue buff, visage, blue elixir, you name it) makes solo baron a piece of cake at lvl 12-13. The only reason I don't run CDR blues every game is because resistances are more important in the 1-7 phase when potions are as big a source of sustain as consume is. The best CDR sources from items IMO are Glacial, Visage, Locket, Stark's, and blue elixir. **You should plan your runes, masteries, and item build around hitting 40% CDR as best you can**. Consider whether you'll be getting blue buff. Do you have the 4% CDR from offense, the 6% from utility, the 6% from runes? Can you afford to rush FH/Visage and sacrifice damage output, or should you stick with Glacial/Kindlegem and supplement with a blue elixir when teamfights and baron roll around? 

High tier: AP, Resistances, Mana/Manareg (to a point).  
AP improves your damage output with a 1.0 ratio on Ice Blast and up to 2.5 (!!) ratio on Absolute Zero, making it stronger than CDR offensively if you can't use Ice Blast on cooldown OR you can somewhat reliably get long channels on your ult. Pure AP is a poor choice unless your composition is built around hitting those full duration ults reliably (teammates like Amumu, Galio, Varus, etc. to keep them from running), but you should almost always pick some up for lane/midgame to emphasize your poke and presence. Resistances are tops bloobie on Nunu because he has a shitload of HP (~75th percentile at lvl 1 and the highest hp/lvl and lvl 18 hp in the game by a wide margin) and since sustain heals damages after resistances, it emphasizes the effect of your consume. Armor is crucial even against AP-heavy compositions because it affects how well you can poke under towers, dive/zone the ADC, and tank Baron. Mana and manareg are crucial on Nunu because he's very mana-hungry and emphasizing CDR especially will oom him quickly in extended engages. How much you need though is a different question entirely. It's a balance between several different factors, chief among them how well you're utilizing your passive (and by extension, how well you're controlling the creep line--being able to freely autoattack and have your passive up for most of your snowballs is a big deal) and how long it takes you to chip away at your opponent's HP through his built-in sustain and supply of potions. You also want to stay above an emergency threshold of ~200 mana to pop your Consume, BB, and Ice Blast in case you're ganked and have to h4h4h4 your way back to your tower. Nothing sucks more than almost getting a kill and having it turned around on you by their jungler because you didn't have the mana to blood boil yourself afterward. Glacial Shroud (seriously, I can't emphasize how good this item is on Nunu), Chalice (into a lategame Athene's or Mikael's), Doran's Rings, Revolver/WotA, Banner of Command, Shard of True Ice, and Banshee's are great pickups that cover these primary stats.

Mid tier: HP, Utility, Spellvamp, Magic Pen.  
HP is obviously great for keeping Nunu tanky and burst-resistant, but it doesn't synergize with Consume and he has so goddamn much base HP that resistances will be the superior survivability choice in the vast majority of instances. As well, you'll likely be picking up lots of incidental HP because it's tied into CDR on Kindlegem and all of its upgrades. You don't need Warmogs to be excessively difficult to kill, and that's 2650 you could've spent toward capping your CDR. Utility and spellvamp are down here in mid tier because although they're very useful, they're not universally useful the way the primary stats are. Revolver is a great midgame pickup, and is probably the best investment after glacial shroud toward soloing baron, but you don't need it if you're not utilizing the combat sustain in teamfights. SV quints and the mastery are obviously stupendous, but they come at a steep cost to earlygame domination. How much utility you get is dependent on several factors: how well your ADC is doing (grab a Stark's if he's snowballing and help him tear shit up), the distribution of incoming damage (double AP steamrolling you in teamfights? Rush that Bulwark!), and how useful you feel as your own individual entity. Getting Sightstone is a very wise choice on Nunu, but that's nearly a chain vest or kindlegem or blasting wand. You don't want to rush it in lane (unless you're getting camped and falling behind), and you very likely want it for ~30 min map control and Baron dances, but finding the perfect moment to get it is a matter of weighing its benefit to the team against raw stats. A good rule of thumb is that you should pick it up after you have your CDR situation squared away and can start putting serious pressure on Baron. Magic pen is strictly inferior to AP and CDR since it only applies to damage, but Sorc Boots are still a strong pickup for lane phase. I strongly advise against Liandry's: it works great with Snowball but that's it, unlike someone like Swain or Singed or Kayle who can apply it over a large area and a long period of time. Coordinate with your support to cover a wide variety of auras 

Low tier: AD, Aspd, Crit, %mvspd, On-hit (everything else)  
You aren't a bruiser. You aren't a melee carry. You have an aspd buff and nothing else. Your pressure on their ADC comes from your ability to snowball them, not to get in their face and trade auto for auto. You can make these stats work, but they will be strictly inferior to caster, tank, and support-styled alternatives. Ravenous Hydra is fun for split pushing, but you're much better off grabbing a Banner of Command since it includes stats you can actually use in teamfights. Not much to really say here.

Boots: Sorc boots are your go-to choice for snowballing your lane if you feel secure in an offensive position. Swiftness are probably your strongest choices overall, though: the 40 higher base movement speed (which synergizes with BB) gives you a ton of added pressure in terms of closing the gap to snowball range + escaping from ganks/focus, and the slow reduction is a big deal on Nunu due to your strong movespeed steroid. Brief CC won't kill Nunu since he's so resilient to burst, but 2 people smacking on you continuously with reapplied slows will fuck your shit up! Up against Darius with Olaf in the jungle? Grab those Swifties if you know what's good for you. Tabi and Mercs are situational choices against heavy AD and AP/CC respectively. In terms of enchants, I think Alacrity is generally the safest choice you can make. Mobility and positioning is big on a short ranged champ with no blink, a % based movespeed boost, a need to stay in range of multiple targets on both teams to apply his buffs, a point blank AoE which is very timing-sensitive, and a combat heal that only works in range of minions. The time between needing to cast consume and actually getting the heal is as long as it takes you to get to a minion. It really adds up. Distortion is great if you choose to go tele/flash and focus on map presence, and Captain is a good pickup if you're going to be in the front of the fight (but less effective if you need to stay back and peel for your ADC).

**Skills:** In general, R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W. The biggest variances in your build are going to be in the first 4 levels. EQEW is my most common start to start snowball pressure immediately and stay topped off from their dmg. Q start is viable if you want to steal a big creep or contest their jungler's buff with your team's help (lvl 1 consume has 75 dmg more than lvl 1 smite). Ward their blue and have your Blitz grab it as soon as it hits 500 HP, then bite it to start out at nearly lvl 2 with blue buff. Shit's bananas. You can also take W at lvl 2 if you don't need the Q sustain to play super aggressively, trade in melee, and ensure a kill if your jungler ganks early. They can flash all they want from an Olaf with BB and ghost--they aren't getting away.

You almost always want to max Q second--at lvl 5 vs lvl 1, you're dealing 80% more dmg, 100% more often, and healing for 175% more. That's 3.6x the total DPS and **5.5x** the total healing compared to lvl 1 which is way more than you get from maxing most spells. Add in CDR, AP, and Vamp and it's no wonder you can solo baron so easily with a pittance of gold at lvl 13. Keep in mind that while spell vamp on magic damage is calculated after resistances, Consume deals TRUE damage and will heal you based on its rank and your AP and spell vamp without resistances coming into play, making for a huge combat heal that scales throughout the entire game. The only exception is if you're seriously dominating the midgame and you want to max blood boil to keep your ADC snowballing for early pushes and finish the game quickly. Obviously you'll want to max BB more if your ADC is Vayne than if it's Ezreal, but again it's a judgement call.

Know how to use your spells. Consume should be used on cooldown as long as you can benefit from the heal. Blood boil should be up on the ADC constantly, or used on cooldown between the ADC and a bruiser if you're at or near max CDR. Snowball should go on the enemy ADC if they're in range or anyone diving your squishies. Only go balls deep to snowball their ADC if your own doesn't need the help. Your ult can be used to catch the enemy by surprise and EMPIRE them, zone squishies/force flashes, serve as an emergency mvspd/aspd slow, cleanup when their interrupts are dead or on cooldown, clear waves, heal you with spellvamp, and chunk Baron/Dragon. Always hop into a bush if it doesn't adversely affect your positioning too much.

**Summoners**: Flash is pretty much mandatory since you have no instant reposition, are vulnerable to ganks, and have a point blank ult that's very positioning-reliant. As for your second spell, I run ignite 90% of the time for early dominance and kill potential, especially during a gank. Exhaust and Teleport are the two best alternate options, Exhaust being great for lategame control (since you're more likely to get in range to exhaust their ADC than a support like Janna or Sona who needs to maintain range) and Teleport for split pushing, particularly with Distortion boots and Banner of Command.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_16n5lr,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/16n5lr/nunu_topmid_burst_the_meta_wide_open_yours_is_the/,

Top lane bruiser? Wriggle's for sustain and armor. AD carry? Wriggle's if you have a no sustain support and for dragon control. 

Was the nerf to the lifesteal that big of an impact? Is the meta more towards front loading damage and proper positioning? 

While I think it may not be the best item for an AD carry, it's a great item to have top lane. I never really see streamers building it anymore though. I figured it would be core on champs like Rengar, Darius and Jayce. If you're against an AD bruiser it seems like a great choice for armor, sustain and a free perma-ward. 

So what happened to Wriggle's Lantern? And who is Wriggle anyway?

EDIT: Great replies so far and I think Phage has replaced Wriggle's because the slow + health is too good. 

Now, how about this. Buying Wriggle's as a GP5 item. It costs 1600 and sells for 1120. If you use 6 wards it paid for itself. That's 18 minutes give or take a couple deaths. It might not be a tournament level strategy, but if you're getting a lot of pressure top lane from AD champs it could be an defensive investment. As mentioned the Chain Vest + Vamp Scepter would provide more armor, but you'd still have to buy wards. Just my 2 cent.

I think that if you have a high enough skill and other quints are not 100% detrimental to success, you should run movespeed quints given that you have enough skill to make them work.

1376340003.0,38,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1k8b4d,3.10 itemization and Vi,axjv,49,11,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1k8b4d/310_itemization_and_vi/,"Platinum jungler here. Vi has always held a special place in my heart as a jungle main. To me, her skill set is both fun and satisfying to use. Landing a full combo on an enemy squishy and watching as they helplessly get dunked has got to be one of the best things in the game.

That being said, Vi has been hit with the nerf-bat in these past couple of months. Pretty hard. First reducing her base damage, then her passive damage, and finally nerfing her gap close ability. To top it all off, Spirit of the Lizard Elder (basically her core item) has seen multiple nerfs due to its popularity with laners. Despite all of this, I still find Vi a very strong, albeit underplayed pick.

In patch 3.10, we have seen the removal of the Runic Bulwark and buffs to various MR items. Subsequently, junglers no longer exclusively build SotAG -&gt; Bulwark every single game. Additionally, the recent jungle spawn changes enable certain junglers to eke out a bit more farm through speedclearing camps. I find playing Vi this patch to be surprisingly powerful when taking advantage of the 3.10 and jungle changes.

Personally, I like to build early damage on Vi, stacking HP and resistances as midgame approaches. This makes her early ganks a bit more effective, and her midgame teamfighting very scary. Specifically, I build:

* Start: Long Sword, Health Potions
* First Back: Vampiric Scepter, Boots, Potions, Wards
* Core: Blade of the Ruined King, Kindlegem, Brutalizer, Tabi/Mercs
* Mid Game: Spirit Visage, Randuin's Omen, Black Cleaver
* Late Game: Trinity Force, Zephyr

Vi clears extremely fast (using Q to hop walls allows her to take advantage of the increased spawn frequency) and has innate sustain with her blast shield, so running lifesteal quints and starting Long Sword allows me to get a very early Bilgewater Cutlass, enabling Vi to gank pre-6 if necessary. The Cutlass also gives Vi the potential for a very early dragon should the opportunity present itself. This turns into a very early BotRK, which with your ult is a guaranteed kill, even with minimal help from a laner.

In the mid-game, grabbing CDR, resistances and HP proves to be very effective. Vi works very well with the buffed Spirit Visage, and grabbing a Warden's Mail on top of that gives a powerful blend of resistances, HP, and CDR. Because 3.10 has increased the efficiency of Spirit Visage and lowered the cost of Warden's Mail, Vi can afford to itemize both damage and tankiness and still be an effective initiator even without substantial farm.

In the late game, Vi needs to be able to burst down a squishy. Grabbing a Trinity Force allows her to do just that, as it provides both the damage and sticking power she needs. The extra HP is always nice as well. Zephyr replaces boots if the game ends up going that long, bringing Vi neatly to the 40% CDR cap.

Although Vi might not be meta per se, I still believe she is a powerful jungler that can fit into many team compositions. Her extremely hard engage along with her substantial damage and armor shred capabilities can oftentimes singlehandedly win engagements. With the changes to the jungle and popular jungle items in recent patches, she is more viable than ever.

I know there are other Vi fans out there; how do you guys build her? Do you still go for the early Lizard Elder? Do you go the tank route and grab an early SotAG? Do you play her in lane? Any innovative new builds you've come up with? Is her low pick rate justified or is it due to players instinctively jumping ship when she got nerfed?

tl;dr: Jungle creeps spawn more, Vi can farm more because her Q gets to camps fast. 3.10 tank items buffed, itemization easier for Vi. All in all, she is stronger this patch (in my opinion).",,False,,t5_2smhl,1376340373.0,,,True,t3_1k8b4d,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1k8b4d/310_itemization_and_vi/,

Creep scoring is cathartic to me. It can also be brutal in certain team comps (suddenly 4 people in your lane, team chants noob bot). But objectively speaking, it's the least diverse lane in the game. Here's why I think that is:

**It is the most strict in terms of meta game**

* One of the few lanes where your enemy dictates your meta. If they aren't splitting cs, you aren't. If you are, you're automatically behind their ADC, unless you can snowball hard.

* What defines an ADC is strict. You're either an AD carry or you're not, there's very little inbetween. Whereas top lane champions can often jungle and vice versa. There are requirements for this role, needs, not just wants.

* ADC and Support have the smallest champion pools in the game at 14 and 12 respectively. Riot loves top lane, or people do because 7 of the last 10 champions can top lane. Here's a count of champions that can be considered conventional picks in their roles:

&gt;Top: 45

&gt;Mid: 36

&gt;Jungle: 33

&gt;ADC: 14

&gt;Support: 12

*To clarify the above refers more to BRUISERS, as almost anyone can go top, or mid for that matter. However top is more defined by who can shit on you, and if you're not a bruiser, a lot of the conventional picks can.)

----

So what solution, if any is there? Well the new jungle seems promising.

&gt;**Reducing early game pressure**

&gt;Season Two opened up more opportunities for junglers to create early game action through ganking lanes. Although this had an overall positive effect on the game, the current rate and effectiveness of early jungle ganking (particularly through brush camping) applies an overwhelming amount of pressure to the lanes. **This significantly reduces the number of champions that can lane effectively by requiring them to either be able to farm from a very safe distance or have a reliable means of quick escape.**

That last line, if not directly aimed at ADCs, is at least most prominent among them. The truly competitive number of ADCs is lower than it's already limited pool. This is in part due to mobility creep, and the holy trinity: Graves, Ezreal, Corki. This wasn't listed above because it's not really the topic of the thread, and can cause a lot of arguing.

Players like Aphromoo are also helping shift the meta. Once tournaments run on the nerfed Ezreal patch, I think Draven is going to make meteoric rise, fitting of his personality. Twitch, and Varus have also seen some competitive play (in part due to Aphromoo). MF and Caitlyn seem to be very close to be becoming more common competitive picks as well, possibly due to their recent QoL buffs.

Tried it a few times lately and I'm fairly confident it's a very good idea. Here's a few reasons why I think so:

* He has *extremely* high base armor for an AD carry. The only AD carry with better armor than him is Graves with his passive. Draven's armor is comparable to or better than most bruisers and his health is decent too. This is somewhat noticeable on bot lane, but on top lane it catches people completely off guard. ""oh, he's just a squishy AD carry, I'll jump on him and slap his shit""... well, no. He'll slap your shit, kill you, recall while doing a helicopter impression, buy two dorans and slap your shit some more.

* Getting in range for Q harass is insanely easy against a melee opponent. And the damage *adds the fuck up*. They started cloth armor? Minor inconvenience.

* Even a small amount of lifesteal gives him pretty good sustain if you're good at juggling his Q on minions.

* People rant about him not having a ""real"" escape, but guess what... many perfectly viable top laners don't have that. Irelia, Malphite, the list goes on. Draven's got a speed boost and a pretty good CC, this allows him to escape from many, if not most, jungle ganks.

* His damage goes up at an extreme rate with Q ranks and any AD he buys. He's also really good with a Black Cleaver, and who doesn't like Black Cleaver? (*boring people* don't like Black Cleaver, that's who)

* He's pretty flexible as far as builds go. He can go for a standard AD carry build if he can and wants to, but he's just fine with an assortment of damage/survivability items like Wriggles, Hexdrinker, Phage or Executioner's Calling (yeah I went there).

Anyways, what are better items to keep in mind based on different situations?

2. Ward Placement. Now this is something that's been annoying the hell out of me. I usually keep dragon+tri-bush warded, but at the start of the game, it takes too much time and I don't want to miss out on XP (especially when I'm Leona, because Level 2 is my cue to be aggressive [Q+E]). So, is it better to just ward River Bush, or should I ward that area between tribush and river bush (on the corner outside of Dragon Pit)? Also, later in the game, what's the best way to go about warding. I have a Ruby Sightstone, but when I'm at full-build, and our jungle needs proper warding, should I always leave an extra item slot open to buy more sight/vision wards? Would that be a detriment against getting an item that can help me engage more/help my team more?

3. Sacrificing. How worth it is it to sacrifice myself for other champs? I know that when doing it for a champ that's fed/on a streak, it's the best thing to do, but sometimes I sacrifice myself for champs that don't make good use of the sacrifice (and they repeatedly do this). What should I use as good judgment for sacrificing myself in a fight so that my team gets the best possible results out of it?

4. Who are truly the best support champs? Again, I understand that champs are good for different applications, such as Blitzcrank/Thresh/Leona for engages, and then you have have CC monsters like Leona and Alistar, and healing champs like Soraka, Sona, and Taric. Some of these champs mix into the other categories much more too, but I'm just emphasizing certain abilities of these champs for the time being. So based on what I want to get out of support (whether aggressive, CC master, healing my champ non-stop, etc.), what would be the best champs for that?

5. Whenever I played ranked games, I frequently get the game where I have poor communication with the ADC (due to them speaking another language), and they engage too hard or play too passively. I try using pings as much as I can, and helping them harass in bot, but it just doesn't take. Don't get me wrong, I completely admit that I have terrible gameplay many times. But, I've also had games where I'm doing the best I truly can as a support, and it just doesn't take. So, with that being said, one thing a lot of people have told me is that it's possible to carry as a support. Can someone explain to me how? It doesn't make sense to me, and I feel that a proper explanation of this, whether it's the mechanics, the gameplay, or just knowing champ abilities, would help me out a lot.

I know this is a big post, and I have tried looking at videos and some guides to help me out with this, but it just doesn't click as well as it should. So, if you have references to vids/guides that you found useful, that's fine, but I'd prefer your own personal experience much more, as it's easier for me to learn through more direct examples.

Also, if there's anything I have wrong in terms of understanding this role, please let me know. I care much more about learning this role rather than validating my opinions.

one obvious disadvantage i can see is that you have a laner stuck with smite but that can still be used well - smiting cannon minions to help push the lane faster.

it would also probably require pre-game prep to have appropriate rune and mastery pages configured as well.

Well, the most frequently banned champions are generally far off from the ones that win the most frequently. Of these I would most notably cite Shen, who, while the most frequent ban at an appalling 73.4% (as of 1:23 PM EST 12/26), has a win rate of only 46.56% (""). 

To me it only seems logical to ban the champion who wins most frequently, but perhaps I'm missing a confounding variable or something of the sort. If someone would care to explain I'd be very pleased.

**EDIT** (4:04 PM EST 12/26): Adding another example of what appears to be a contradiction, that is Diana. She holds, as of now, the lowest win rate of any champion in the game. Yet, her ban rate is among the highest (31.26%).

**EDIT 2** (4:08 PM EST 12/26): It should be noted that, in my original post, I meant to imply the importance of choose order and cooperation with your team in the process of banning. That being said, these are not valid reasons for the tendency to ban the champions I mentioned.

**EDIT 3** (10:27 AM EST 12/27): Many of you mentioned popularity being put into consideration when banning and how ban rate is an otherwise loose statistic. To combat this, I made a spreadsheet creating what I call ""Ban Potential"". This term refers to the interest one might have in banning a champion based on how popular the champion is and their ability to win. This produces an arbitrary number to be used in reference with other champions to see who is the most logical ban (Of course also consider needs of your team). Comparing this data with ban rate, it appears popularity still does not justify the obscure bans that are most popular.
For those interested, the formula I used was    
 100(P/(1-B))*W

P being popularity expressed as a decimal, B ban rate expressed as a decimal, and W win rate expressed as a decimal.

I encourage taric maniacs to scroll through the  comments and read what people have to say.

edit2: Thinking about it a bit more, I think ""Hybrid"" in the title may not be optimal after all.  Playing around with some other AP-focused builds and they seem pretty slick.  I still like the idea of flat AD runes with a sometimes-dorans blade start, because it really helps establish his lane presence early game.  however, I'm willing to concede that AD items may not be necessary

Y'all read the topic title  and you already think I'm crazy.  I encourage you to read past that and just hear me out.

Let it be known, while I am an advocat for Top Taric's viability, there are certain champions I obviously would never pick him against (olaf, irelia, darius maybe, even a vayne on bottom in despite being a completely different lane.  True damage kinda sucks for an armor fiend.)

Let's state some facts here, first.  

* Tarics kit *can* be a very offensive one.  His passive can keep his mana high, his heal (with some CDR as autoattacking to reduce the cooldown) can proc sheen a million times.  His armor buff also serves as a nuke/armor shredder.  His gems stun-  good for offense and gank prevention.  His ult nukes and gives him hybrid stat bonuses with an insanely low CD.
* Taric has the highest level 1 base AD in the game.  If you roll 21 in offense and have full AD reds/quints, he starts with 80 AD.  With his armor and sustain, you could maybe justify a Doran's Blade opening, too.  90 AD last hitting (with a super responsive auto attack) at level 1 is a godsend, and you get tons of mana for it from your passive.  You can win early pokes/trades with other melee champions early game with this alone (though his attack speed sucks, so don't fully commit until you're ready to spike somebody.)
* Insane lane clearing with his W (especially if you chain it with Iceborn Gauntlet.)
* Even if his kit doesn't scale off AD, he makes up for it in utility.  This is the same concept that was applied to AD Kennen many months ago- ""who needs scaling when you can stun people?""  Even then, this is a hybrid build, so he will get some AP scaling nonetheless.

Inspired by a recent thread, I decided to re-examine top Taric for season 3.  I've always loved him, but my friends rarely let me play him (and, frankly, I do better with Darius.)  I'm not a high Elo player, but regardless, people underestimated him all the time.  However, as the metagame shifts, we see champions being played in nontraditional lanes all the time.  Why not Taric?  Why is he resigned to bottom lane?

I'm running 21/6/3 masteries, going for both physical and magic penetration in Offense, scaling health and 2 in armor on defense, with Flash/mana regen in utility.  Flat damage reds/quints, armor yellows and MR/lvl blues.

I'm still thinking about the items, but the ""average build"" (non-specific to matchups) I like is ~~Merc Treads, Iceborn Gauntlets, Gunblade, Black Cleaver, Spirit Visage and Guardian Angel~~.  Running the numbers, here's what his stats are at level 18 with full gear. *edit: nevermind, i've been enlightened.

* ~~216~~ AD (+70 from Ult, 125% AoE base dmg from Frozen Fist proc) (lower, after consideration)
* ~~123~~ AP (+70 from Ult) (higher, after consideration)
* ~2500 HP.  Somewhat low for a bruiser, but he has 230 armor, 180 MR and big, frequent self-heals.
* With spirit visage and ult on,  he can heal himself for over 550 health.  With gunblade, consider that you'll have life steal/spell vamp as well.
* With 40% CDR, his heal has a ~9.5 second cooldown, reduced by 1/3 seconds for minion/champion autoattack hits, allowing you to spam heals and sheen procs.
* With 40% CDR, his ult cools down every 36 seconds.  It lasts 10 seconds.  It does tons of damage and buffs the hell out of you and your team.  So when you read the numbers I've listed, consider that you'll have it available for every teamfight- maybe twice, even, if it's a long one.
* In fact, all of his cooldowns are super low with high CDR.  Shatter and Dazzle are on 6 seconds with 40%.
* With Frozen Fist, Gunblade and Dazzle, you have 3 forms of CC.  Great for keeping people off your ADC, not to mention your heal spam.

Do other people do more damage?  Yes, but they don't have the same utility.  I would refer to Taric as a ""support bruiser"" late game, but early game his ERW+Sheen attack+heal+sheen attack+ignite can do ridiculous damage against unsuspecting enemies.

Late game, that damage isn't negligible by any means.  That combo can deal over 1400 damage (before MR) with the spells alone, let alone sheen proc attacks.  With your armor, heal spam and slew of slows, you *might* even be able to stand toe to toe with certain ADCs (those without escapes, anyway.)

I'm by no means saying ""everybody should play Hybrid Taric, always."" He isn't the greatest thing in the game.  If a team has any true damage at all, his armor isn't so great.  However, I do think he's worthy of consideration in certain team comps/matchups.  If you're facing a champion with little/no escapes (even some AP champions, if you rush Visage) he has significant burst potential.  Harass with your level 1 80/90 AD auto attacks until you can stun-burst for the kill.  Farm/sustain with W/Q if you can't.

I urge you to give it a try.  At the very least, it's just extremely fun to surprise people who think Taric can't be a bruiser.

Sure he can be managed, but let's go over why the scales are usually in his favor:

1) spammable nuke with massive range. Not only does it clear waves incredibly fast due to the minion bonus, it is difficult to determine when you are in range. Sometimes it misses me when I'm close, sometimes it hits me at a range equal to Kog's ult. Not only this, but there is no way to determine whether he is going to gap close onto you or hit a minion. To finish it all out, he is invulnerable for the duration, at least as far as I can tell.

2) sustain: can refill health to full unless interrupted. Even then he has probably filled about a quarter of it, and even ignite doesn't mitigate it enough to make him killable unless he is really low.

3) AA: wuju style basically gives him a free BF sword, which outside of runes is pretty much impossible to itemize against as an AP mid. 

4) free escape ult.


Obviously, people will point to hard CC as a counter. However, if you can't hit him during his close, 1 second isn't going to matter in the trade. If you use it to stop the meditate, he will simply close knowing that now the trade is in his favor.

Taking exhaust mid as AP seems like it would help by at least giving you enough escapes to run from two trades if you needed to.

The biggest issue I've had is the poke. It's incredibly difficult to dodge, and any smart Yi will just sit back and wait for waves to hit the middle, poke a few times and repeat. AP mids can't turret farm very effectively like a top or carry can.

Any ideas, brainstorming, etc? I've played a huge amount of games as mid, and while I can usually deal with a Yi it feels like there should be a better way.

After reading some stuff and watching a bit of Azubu Blaze VS TSM games and with the recent tournaments, I've come to the conclusion that these are the best junglers at the moment.

First, what I mean by ""Korean meta"" is what we see now, the agressive push, the mid game forcing, the lane swaping, etc. that became common in all regions since the godly asswhoping TSM had on MLG. Every team shifted to that playstyle, because you either play Anivia and stall the game to the next Eon (making her, probably, the natural counter to the Korean meta), or you're forced to play that way or you'll crumble against the other team.

Now, the junglers.

* Skarner: decent clear time, hard motherfucking engage, tanky, doesn't need many items, not a ""wriggle's jungler"", perma slow in a TF.
* Maokai: decent clear time, good engage, not dependant of lvl6 for good ganks, slow/small knockup spam in a TF, tanky, doesn't need many items, not a ""wriggle's jungler"", and an absurdly OP ultimate in this meta.

Skarner without a very very good peeler, he'll just get SOMEONE and force a 4v5 because he'll be instabursted by the team when he uses his ultimate. In the worse case, it will force a 4v4 during a small time, disabling a key member. This meta likes teamfights and forces them, in order to snowball even harder.

Maokai at level 3 (max 4) has all his tricks to gank. Can get to a key member and CC him ""a bit"", it's all okay. But his ultimate is the ""special thing"" here. IMO, Maokai should be either permabanned or instapicked because of his ultimate. You push a turret, they are trying to defend it. Pop ulti, ignore their damage and proceed to damage the turret. They are in advantage and a team fight is imminent, pop ulti, reduce damage. His ultimate is of an absurd utility in this agressive metagame because it works both ways, making it easier to siege a turret and to fight a snowballed team.


Also, since both don't build wriggles, they can go GP5 and/or Oracles very early.

1343626631.0,37,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,xdmvt,Nunu - So strong now?,thekidsaremad,40,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/xdmvt/nunu_so_strong_now/,"EDIT: glad to see the pros have also picked up on his strength, I see him banned/picked in many high level games these days

So I started using nunu again after seeing OddOne playing him after his buffs, after using him myself I'm almost convinced he's a top pick jungler now. Nunu has a huge list of benefits as far as his style, the strongest being he can run 100% GP5 runes/masteries/items(no avarice though) and still do perfectly fine early/mid game. Certain champs in LoL scale just off their abilities alone and are quite resilient in their own ways without much item support. This has always been accepted in supports, but nunu can jungle (and effectively!) while running this setup. He doesn't face lane pressure to exploit it and he doesn't need the speed/tanking/dmg other junglers need to get rolling from the runes/masteries. His skills scale very well, and he can just get super tanky mid-late game from his huge gold income. 

 Pros:
- Crazy gold income, I'm usually getting scores like 4-3-15 while my carries are collecting the kills and I'm out farming them in the end by often 2-4k. 

- Early game counter jungling is huge, ideally - eat their blue wraith, smiteless leash at your blue, blood boil + eat + smite their red then gank with level 3. You take bloodboil level 2 to counter jungle for mobility, worst comes to worst you can run away without using flash often. 

- His ganks are very strong due to the fact that he can just spam ganks due to his bloodboil, he can be all over the map quite easily and since he's GP5 he's not really losing out on income. 

- He can use his speed to provide all sorts of support, if your map awareness is good you can easily control the map with nunu due to the power of your disengage/chasing/supporting/warding. 

- His consume is a great fall back, depending on how the early game is going somtimes I'll get level 2 consume and just farm it up.

- Late game he really shines, if you have another real support and you have a hyper carry like kog you can really make your team fighting DPS huge. 

- Massive peel, learn to peel for your team mates with nunu and you will carry games. 

- His ult is also great for ganks, bloodboil -&gt; iceblast -&gt; run ahead of them -&gt; channel ult. 

- He doesn't need dps items so he can afford to buy things like randuins/frozen heart/reverie/etc and he's guaranteed the gold due to his GP5 setup.

- Can cover and counter pressure lanes, if your team mate has to back you can just run in there, snowball them, heal off a minion, snowball them, run around, etc. His speed makes this less of a setback, plus gp5. Seems most junglers don't understand counter pressure, if you run in and make their mid use half their mana you've helped your team mate at least get the cs while you pressure. 

Cons: 
- He doesn't have ""hard cc"" - but the fact is that he has 2 reliable slows + the ability to make him and his ally significantly faster. 

- If they attempt to counter pick your strategy you may lose if you don't know how to adapt, if they pick a red start jungler you can always invade their blue at the start. If you don't react and use your map vision/sense nunu will likely not work out for you. 

- If your team isn't with you it might make life hard, if they won't leash, react to ganks, react to objectives (dragon + buff steals are big for nunu), or help you if you get caught in the jungle you might get set back.


 I can't really think of any reason why someone experienced wouldn't want to pick him up, I'm sure if they played perfect defense you could shut him down early but the fact is even if you set him back he's still ahead cause he starts the game with like 7.2gp5 or something and it doesn't really slow him down.

1328909642.0,33,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,pjx0a,[[Playing Kog'Maw]] + Support Friends,PaulWeiner,38,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/pjx0a/playing_kogmaw_support_friends/,"**Overview:**

The purpose of this post is to help you learn to play Kog'Maw. This post will focus on the lane-phase, with some detail on friendly and enemy supports that have great synergy with or counter Kog, respectively.


**How to Play Kog in lane:**

Kog'maw's strength in lane comes from his ability to consistently land his long-range auto attacks and ultimate.  In order to be successful as Kog'Maw you **need to master the orb walk** and *need to be aggressive with your range*.  This means taking the time to walk forward and right click.  

If your W is off CD, and you won't miss a creep kill, move to Auto attack your enemy.  If they move towards you to retaliate, mirror their movement, moving backwards. When they change their mind and turn around, follow and hit them with another auto-attack.  You can repeat this until your W wears off.  

However, his lack of a true escape means that you are weak against strong (blink) initiation.  You counter this weakness in two ways:

First, and most importantly, using wards and good support positioning to maintain vision.  I know in this meta the support is supposed to buy wards, but more often than not I will buy 2-5 wards within the first 20 minutes to help the team (mostly myself).

Second, by using your poke (W/R) to keep an HP advantage on your enemy, discouraging initiation and giving yourself the ability to come into a battle ahead of your enemy in HP.  Using a Taric or Alistair as an example:  If you see these champions walking towards you to land their cc, walk backwards until they stop chasing, at which point you activate your W and shoot them as they walk backwards to the safety of a minion wave, tower or brush.

Oftentimes, this aggressive play causes them to beg for jungle help, leading them into feeding you kills!  Which brings me to my next points:

1. Importance of movement speed
2. How to turn enemy ganks into kills for you

Movement speed is arguably the most critical stat on Kog'Maw for two reasons.  Defensively, you need to be able to outrun champions coming to kill you and dodge skillshots; Udyr, Skarner; Shyvana for example.  Offensively, a MS advantage means you can easily land free damage upon activation of your W.  Obviously, this dependence on movement speed makes boots as your first item a no-brainer (and zerkers/zeal also strong early items).

Now when the time comes, you're going to want to use your full combo to do the most damage possible, as well as provide you with the greatest utility and positioning to do sustained damage and land auto attacks and R's. The most important spell to land well is your E, aka your slow vomit path, which should be leveled after your R and W.

There are a few ways to use this spell.  Ideally, you want to hit your enemies with it to maximize your damage.  Next, you want to block their escape/offensive paths.  Often, when running away, it's better to throw it down in front of your path, rather than toward/in-front of your enemies.

When using it offensively it's good to aim it in a way that creates a path of vomit perpendicular to the lane (as opposed to in line with it) ensuring it's tough to dodge/ignore.  The area of effect was recently buffed making it significantly more effective at sticking enemies in place.  Don't rush to cast this spell.  It's most effective if it catches enemies well within your range.  

For example if an udyr (or similar melee ganker) tries to close the gap, first run away, baiting him close, then active W, turn AA-Q-E-AA slowing his current position, escape path, and the path of any friends who might be following.

Stay aggressive in these scenarios.  A Kog'Maw doing his thing in lane is really frustrating and other AD carries/supports will often get over-zealous when his jungle has just come to gank and will often step way out of position giving you free kills if you're ready to capitalize.  

**Lane Control and Supports:**

The most important skill to master as Kog'Maw is controlling the position of the lane to minimize your opponents opportunities to initiate on you.  You do not want to give them an opportunity to use the brush offensively.  Champions like alistar, taric, and leona are really troubling if they can sit in a bush that you do not have vision of. 

You may need to tell your support to maintain brush vision if he's failing to properly support you.  This is specifically important if the lane is being pushed to right outside of your tower range, because enemies can rape you from that bush when you try to CS (Alistar combo into wall, Vayne condemn).

Oftentimes, pushing the lane to the enemy tower (specifically when you're purple) allows you to aggressively zone them and deny them use of the brush (provided you have proper warding).  Your long range allows you to time your Autoattacks on the enemy so the tower never has time to target and fire on you.  When your W is on CD focus on hitting the turret, but when it's not, focus on denying your enemy by harassing him under the tower.

Don't be in a rush to take the tower, because your ability to safely push the other AD carry out of lane is significantly reduced.

At early levels, Kog'Maw has a hard time last hitting under the tower.  If you're against an enemy that keeps pushing the lane with their abilities (Graves, Leona, Cait, Ashe, etc.), you will have to spend most of your time Auto attacking the creep to keep from being pushed into your tower, or into a bad position. 

Some of the best support combos with Kog'Maw are as follows:

Soraka: Allows for more liberal skill usage, her starfall increases your magic damage, maintain HP advantage, but most importantly, keeps your enemy from getting her.  Soraka is the bane of your existence in the lane phase, because she'll cut the damage of all your abilities with her passive, and nullify most of your poke.  

Janna:  Passive Movement speed bonus makes doing ""Kog'Maw"" things like finishing a fleeing enemy with R, landing more AA's, and escaping much easier and more consistent.  Also, her AD bonus encourages you to build an early zeal, after zerks. Her knock up is amazing for defensive purposes.  The lack of sustain shouldn't hurt you, just be aware of HP advantage and use potions to keep your hp up.

Nunu: Great initiation and blood boil is made for Kog'maw.  Also, Absolute Zero (Nunu ultimate) is amazing counter initiation.  Plus a good nunu knows he can get HP back with consume, so he should have no problem maintaining brush control.  Against pushing lanes, it's great to let Nunu stack his passive as well (filling in one of your weaknesses).  

Taric:  Pick when you're against Vayne.  If she tumbles in, she's dead, generally.  Taric is also useful to flash-&gt;stun for the finish on enemies that you've poked down.  Your damage is split between magic and physical, so his shatter isn't as useful with Kog, but he also has good bush control.  Taric is also a decent pick versus Soraka, because at level 6, your combined burst can usually kill her, especially if you force her to use her heal on the carry right before hand.

Sona: Strong support, but Kog can't really take advantage of her level 1-3 dominance because those are his weakest levels by far. Also, very few Sonas are good as using their E at the right moments to let you harass, in my experience.  That being said, her Q gives bonuses to AD and AP, which Kog'Maw can utilize better than most, because his W and R scale off of both stats.


Hopefully this helps some aspiring Kog'Maw players.  Best of luck!",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_pjx0a,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/pjx0a/playing_kogmaw_support_friends/,

It was a nice cheap item (around 2150 if I remember correctly) that was great for champions like Udyr and Skarner since it amplified their damage while also providing a tidy amount of MR. A nerf to attack speed at the beginning of S3 has meant that the Wit's End has since fallen out of favour despite an apparent buff upon the recent removal of the Malady. It didn't take long for me to realize why it is that it is no longer popular:

It has an unattractive build path.

When Madred's Bloodrazor and Ionic Spark left the game, the malleability of the recurve bow went to shit. So now you're left with a decently cost effective item that isn't built simply because one of it's components is a seriously limiting buy. To compare:

* If you are playing Irelia and you buy a Recurve Bow, your options are limited to Wit's End, Sword of the Divine and Runaan's Hurricane. Only one of these items is a viable buy.

* If you are playing Irelia and you buy a Giant's belt, your options are Frozen Mallet, Randuin's Omen, Sunfire Cape, Warmog's and Rylai's Crystal Scepter. Four of which can be used by Irelia with great efficiency.

Simply, Wit's End isn't *that* amazing. If it were a core, game changing item then the investment may be worthwhile gamble, but as it is the purchase simply isn't worth the Risk of getting caught with your pants down.

**TL;DR**

Recurve Bow is the problem with Wit's End. I'd love to elaborate as to what would be a better build path (Stinger maybe?) but I have to go collect my dog from somewhere.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1itabi,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1itabi/the_problem_with_wits_end/,

I've been seeing him a lot and quite frankly he's really difficult to deal with if your team is not coordinated (soloq). 
He's able to completely shutdown a jungler now that buffs give more exp. 

I had 2 recent games as j4 against nunus. Lost 1 then changed my strat and won the other. 
In both I managed to protect my blue but got red stolen as I arrived and was stuck at level 2 for a long period, really hurting my ganks. 
The first one was bad I basically was near useless and levels behind everyone and they kept their jungle warded so I even died trying to get some resources from their jungle. 
The second game was different, I decided to waste nunus time by counterjungling myself. I took everything valuable from my jungle then left it dry for a period (small monsters only). 
During this period I warded all over nunus jungle and counterjungled him hard. 
Eventually he realized this and stopped going to my jungle, at which point I killed the small monsters and brought life back to my jungle. 
Even if he realizes, at this point you are grouped and its a whole different game. 
I personally think this is the best way to deal with counterjungling when your team doesn't want to help and miss a few cs.

1371275457.0,35,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1gdyai,The Solo Queue Playbook: Simple Strategies for Success; part 2 (early laning phase),BlueNoseReindeer,40,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1gdyai/the_solo_queue_playbook_simple_strategies_for/,"Yesterday I talked about [L1 strats] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g81my/the_solo_queue_playbook_simple_strategies_for/) which can help your team get off on the right foot, although that's all they can do (I had a game today where we went 4-0 + summoners in a L1 engage, and ended up losing). Today I'd like to talk about the next step, the early laning phase, levels 1-5.

**During the early laning phase the most important person is the jungler.** Simply put, the jungler can create 2v1s or 3v2s at any point in time. As such, map awareness (knowing where junglers are at so you can aggress accordingly) and warding (to win the gank war) are essential during this phase. How each team uses their jungler and reacts to the enemy's jungler are usually the biggest factors. So, you need to understand how each jungler works.

* **Usually** Non-Mainstream junglers like Yi, Ez, and Trynd, are rare because they lack early ganking potential unless their enemy is seriously mispositioned. If you have one of these junglers on your team, odds are early ganks aren't going to be successful unless the enemy is pushing hard without ward coverage.

* Snowbally Assassin Junglers like Shaco and Lee Sin, who are known for early ganks should be feared from the very start. If you have someone who can gank comfortably from level 2, odds are they will gank you right away, you should be prepared.

* General junglers, like Amumu, Naut, and Sej usually look to start ganking around level 3-4 to gank. Make sure you know how each jungler's ganks work so that you can best avoid them.

These are general outlines to give you some context of when junglers hit power levels if you hadn't thought about it before, but **every jungling champion is unique and must be assessed individually, as well as every jungling summoner.** For example, I will almost always wait until level 4 to get my Nautilus hook when I am jungling, but many people will get it at Level 3, and some may even get it at level 2, depending on how much they want to force a gank.

Don't assume that just because you're going against an Amumu that he wont gank until he hits 4 (AKA: you should probably still get wards); if he can get a good gank off at L2 or L3 that will snowball a lane he's done his job, and investing a skill point in bandage toss will be worth. So what use is knowing that Amumu is weaker earlier than Shaco if you still have to ward? For one thing you can push harder, since warding against Shaco doesn't guarantee safety due to his stealth. For another thing, you can bait out early ganks/wasting time by playing *slightly* more passive. A Lee Sin walking through a ward means you should probably back off immediately (if he has flash he has 3 gapclosers, CC, AND strong burst even at L2 (if he started red), and that's not even considering his teammate(s) in the lane. A Malphite at L2 is significantly less imposing, and if you can get him to waste time thinking a gank opportunity will come up, or bait him into coming in when you are able to disengage (probably causing him to invest a point in his slow, which will increase his clear times) it will be a minor victory for you.

On the same note, depending on your lane opponent(s) and the jungler, it may be worth it to invest in defensive/escape abilities earlier when you know you are facing a strong early jungler, because if you can foil their plans early, you will (generally) be able to handle them easily late. For example, as Morgana Mid if my lane is pushing early I may get my shield at L2 or L3 instead of L4 like I prefer to, because I know without it I'm a death waiting to happen. The more factors there are to increase the success of a gank on me (factors like strength of the jungler currently, easy setup from lane opponent, and vision control) the more likely I am to invest in my shield when it comes times to allocate the skill point.

The summoner spell teleport, as well global ultimates are hugely important factors to keep in mind, but these have very little relevance in the early laning phase, so I'll wait to discuss them in my next article.

Okay, there is some general advice that should help you set up good ganks, as well as avoid good ganks. Now to specific plays.

1. **The Simple Gank.** Jungler gets in position, laner(s) initiate, jungler swoops in and gets kill/summoners/both. The biggest problem with this is that oftentimes laners don't see their junglers, and don't set something up, so the jungler goes in without a setup and the gank fails. As a jungler, ping to let your teammate know you are there, it makes all the difference. As a laner, let your jungler know **ahead of time** to ping when he gets near, especially if this is a common problem for you (like it used to be for me). The second biggest problem with the simple gank is that sometimes it's not possible for some reason (e.g. the lane is pushed), and the jungler will just waste their time waiting for a gank that will never happen. As a jungler, set a limit on yourself for how long you will stay for a potential gank. As a laner, if you know you can't (or just don't want to) set up a gank, ping the jungler back. If you're ganks aren't working out, one of these two things is probably why. As for when it is optimal to gank, I could write a whole article on that, if you would like that, let me know. One mistake I see even in mid-Platinum is that when ganking botlane, the gankers will focus completely on the ADC. **When you gank, focus the person with the least escapes,** focusing an ADC during laning phase has no real advantage (ADCs don't do that much more damage than supports at this point), unless they are just easier to pick off, and will often lead to sub-par and even downright horrible results (Sona will kite you rather viciously at early levels). Of course, if the lane is going so badly that the laners can't survive the fight that will ensue from a gank, odds are it will be a waste of your time to be there in the first place.

2. **The Countergank.** One laner knows a gank is coming, and sets up a trap, usually with their jungler and/or tower. Obviously, this requires wards, and almost always requires a nearby ally (or global ult) that the enemy doesn't bring into their calculations. The key in counterganking is to anticipate their actions, and have your response ready. If you're Ez/Nami/Amumu against a Draven/Leona/Sej, you know that they will initiate with Draven's knock, Leona's pull, or Sej's dive. If you get hit by all of these things your counter won't go well (because you're dead), but if you don't get hit by any you won't be in the best position to countergank them, and mayhem from uncoordination (e.g. Amumu dives their tower while Ez stays back to farm) has a high chance of occurring. Once you get hit initiated on, use your counter-initiate tools, in this case Nami's bubble and Amumu's bandage toss, most likely followed up by Ez's jump, and Nami heal/slowing shots/speedups, and of course everyone's damage dealing abilities. Fights this early are almost always contestable (Draven/Leona/Sej can still fight an Ez/Nami/Amumu countergank successfully, the element of surprise, a largely psychological edge, will be your only avantage, unless they get greedy and try to dive or soemthing), and anytime a fight will be close is no time to be stingy, use your summoner spells, get off as many autoattacks as you can, use every tool you can think of (minions? towers? terrain/brush?) or else your countergank can still be beaten. **As with regular ganks, focus whoever is easiest to kill, regardless of what position they are.** If you are the better scaling **team** 1 for 1s are worth it, otherwise they aren't.

3. **Counterjungling.** Counterjungler invades jungler's jungle, and tries to kill jungler and/or steal a buff. This is something to take into account during the first few minutes of the game depending on if there are any strong counterjunglers on either team (e.g. Nunu, Lee, Shaco), and at the 7:00 mark no matter what. The important thing to remember in counterjungling is that it isn't a one-man job. The team that is able to help their jungler faster will almost always come out on top of the engage, even if their jungler gets killed/loses a buff (e.g. if Nunu kills Naut, ending up with doublebuffs, but then dies to a laner, that laner will have doublebuffs, putting Naut's team ahead). With the high popularity of smiteless leashes, it is very easy with a ward to steal the first buff of a jungler with many champions, and many midplayers invest in an early ward to do so. What is significantly less common is to return at the 7:00 mark (a little earlier to ward is actually better) to take the first respawn of the buff. You know when it will be, and if you have vision it is an easy steal, potentially without even bringing your jungler (though not often). The important thing with a 7:00 counterjungle is to know where **everyone** on the enemy team is, especially their jungler. Solo lanes start hitting L6 around this time, so they are having a major powerspike, be very careful of them should a fight erupt. The game will most likely still be very close, so settle for small gains (probably just the buff unless you know it will be an easy kill as well) and don't go chasing deep for any reason. Also, if the jungler started blue buff, they will probably give it over to their mid, giving you exact information about where that person will be, potentially setting up an easy ambush before/after the buff transfer, depending on the matchup mid. The key with counterjungling is to not be greedy, settle for small gains at all stages, and **gradually** grow them into bigger leads.

4. **Sneaky Dragon.** This is a rare play, and I am running out of room in this post, so I won't say much about this except to keep ward coverage if possible, and if it is not possible then be highly aware of potential of the jungler to solo dragon (Nunu, Warwick, Nasus, and Shaco are a few who are very good at this) and keep track of the enemy botlane. If you think they are taking it, odds are you should fight them since dragon will weaken them substantially early on (and you can catch them between indecision and more indecision).

As always, I encourage you to add, argue, etc. in the comments.

It has been one of the most effective strategies in securing First Blood. There have been different ideas on how to beat this strategy--such as warding in otherwise peculiar spots and counter ganks--but it seems that the only effective strategy is to do a three man dive on the other team's solo lane **before** they do it to you. 

Next, teams often complete the opener by quickly beating down the turret to secure the first turret, giving the team about a 1.5k Gold advantage.

After that, the strategies differ. Sometimes we see teams swing down to mid or bot and try to take more outer turrets, set up for Dragon, but generally, the duo lane will go and farm against the enemy duo lane and the jungler will go back to farming the jungle and applying pressure around the map.

While watching the Tencent LPL (Chinese LCS), I saw a slight differentiation on this strategy. 
Here's the game: http://tga.qq.com/act/a20130301pl/livecont.shtml?iProdId=93
At first, I thought Wings of Aurora was going to have a wandering Pantheon who, along with the Xin Zhao, would run into lanes, dive under turret, and kill their enemies--in a similar fashion to M5's wandering Alistar/Lee Sin with an Urgot solo lane bot. Wings of Aurora start by doing a three man dive on Positive Energy's top lane, then they immediately take the turret. Up to this point, they are doing the strategy I previously mentioned.

Here's where Wings of Aurora diverts from the NA/EU standard. After taking the top turret, Xin Zhao, Pantheon, and Graves all go bot lane, and proceed to attempt to massacre PE's bot lane. It's important to note that Wings chose Gangplank and Karthus so they could apply massive global pressure on bot lane while Xin stayed down there. For a long time, League of Legends has had a lane setup of 1-1-2 with a jungler, but what about a 1-1-3 setup, or, as it was known in DotA, a Tri-Lane. Xin goes in and out of the lane at some points, but he exerts pressure exclusively on his team's duo lane. I'm curious what other people think about this strategy, as I personally found it really surprising to see it work as effectively as it did.

I guess the general goal of the Tri-Lane needs to be to shut down the opposing ADC and Support as much as possible, because it doesn't matter that you're splitting gold/exp across three champions if the other team is getting substantially less gold/exp. It's also important to note that starting out with going for a dive to get first blood and first turret is a great way to open up this strategy, as it puts one of their solo laners behind, gives your whole team gold/exp, and sets you up to be ahead for the Tri-Lane. Then, when you get to the tri-lane vs duo lane you have a gold advantage and your solo lanes are closer to being level 6 (when they can start applying global pressure).

Now, in that game, Wings of Aurora lost. But having never seen a Pantheon support in competitive play, I found this pick to be really interesting. I would note that Pantheon gets banned a lot in the LPL and against various teams, so I would assume that he has seeped his way into the Chinese metagame as a very aggressive support. Especially in a game where diving turrets is a big part of the game, Pantheon is fantastic, as he can tank more turret shots than any other champion at level 1 and 2 and has reliable, hard CC.

So the question I have is what do you guys think about the Tri-Lane and Pantheon support? I can say that just thinking about it, at first I'm a little hesitant about a Tri-Lane. On the other hand, I think that Pantheon support could be really effective, and he's proven himself in China. The thing about Pantheon support is that he really lends himself to a Tri-Lane strategy, so you can continuously dive their ADC and Support and shut them down. This made me re-evaluate the Tri-Lane, and it makes me think that it could be really effective, especially with Global presence like Karthus, Twisted Fate, Shen, or Gangplank.

I wonder if we'll see Pantheon support get picked up by any NA/EU teams. Basically all innovation in the support role has come from China/Korea, and then it later gets picked up by NA/EU supports (think Zyra, Elise, etc.). I think that Pantheon is going to be the next Elise support, especially if diving continues to be such a potent strategy.

**EDIT:** Just a thought, I wonder if Pantheon will be the new support that Dignitas has been hyping up. I might be behind and it might already be known what it is, but I believe that they still claim to have something up their sleeves ready to pull out for Patoy. It's not Elise according to what Scarra said, so I wonder if we'll see Patoy pulling out Pantheon.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1364352001.0,,,True,t3_1b2ny9,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1b2ny9/the_emergence_of_the_trilane_and_pantheon_support/,

So, I was in a TT game as Ryze and decided to try out Barrier for giggles. Then, obviously, I grabbed Archangel's Staff, because that's pretty standard on Ryze this season. Then, I was having trouble surviving burst damage from Brand, so I upgraded the Catalyst I was carrying around into a Banshee's Veil. At that point, AAS upgraded into Seraph's Embrace, and I realised that I had three different shields on me... So naturally I grabbed Locket of the Iron Solari for a fourth. (At that point, we were turning the tables after losing the early game, so I felt comfortable burning the gold on it.)

It was actually *really* funny deploying all my shields in response to the enemy trying to focus me down, especially when I would hit R and heal back up while murdering them all. But that got me to thinking that it would be pretty sweet to put that build on a real tank.

Like Singed.

Singed gets mana as health, so he liked Archangel's Staff and Banshee's Veil anyway. And since he can expect to draw heat from the ADC, Locket's health and armour makes sense on him as well. (Even if it's intended as more of a support item.) Plus, Singed's whole thing is trolling the enemy team by escaping with just a sliver of health, baiting them to chase through his poison in hopes of getting a kill. What better way to bait and troll than by packing shields on top of his existing tankiness?

You could even pad out the shieldiness by tossing on a Hexdrinker/Maw as well, although the AD would be mostly wasted. Probably not worth it except to counter magic-heavy teams.

Thoughts? Suggestions? What other items fit this kind of build? What other champions could benefit?

1353242377.0,33,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,13ea8m,Season 3 Shaco Analysis and Discussion,ItsBricksOutHere,37,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/13ea8m/season_3_shaco_analysis_and_discussion/,"Hey LeagueofLegendsMeta,

As soon as the Season 3 material hit the PBE, I jumped on as quick as I could to test out my favorite jungler, Shaco.

I have played quite a few games, both live and custom testing. So I figured I would share what I have seen thus far.

**Masteries**: 21/9/0

**Runes**: AS Reds, Armour Yellows, MS Quints, MR/lvl Blues.

**Firstly, his jungle clear.** 

Shaco does very well in the new jungle. The typical route I followed was either Red-Wolves-Blue, or Blue-Wolves-Red. Skill order usually being WEQ (or WQ if ganking immediatly)

Unfortunately in season 3, you cannot really do wolves or wraiths as Shaco, because you need every single box at the big camps to clear them quickly, and the buffed wolves do not go down fast enough.

Despite this, if you stack all boxes at red or blue, do wolves, then finish the other buff, you exit the jungle at level 3 around the same time as current standards.

Unlike most other junglers in season 3, Shaco is still able to start boots + 3 pots comfortably, but it will hurt his sustain a little bit.

In any case, the relative jungle shift has really helped his invasion potential, because now Shaco will be fighting enemy junglers at lower HP.

On a really postive note, the reduction in price of madreds razor is a nice buff in Shaco's jungling. The reduced cost means that even if Shaco doesn't succeed in ganking at first, he can more easily begin farming the jungle to catch up.  Obviously this applies to more than shaco, but he was a particular champ who had difficulty efficiently clearing until he got madreds/wriggles.

Ultimately, Shaco's early-mid jungling has been improved.

Now, **New items and builds!**

Honestly, there are just too many options to really talk about them all, so I will speak about a few key things.

First, my absolute favorite item so far on Shaco is **Sword of the Divine** (Give 40% AS. Active: Next 3 attacks have 100% crit, or next 5sec. While on cd the AS is lost). 

I legitimately think this item is broken on assassins. In Shaco's case, there are 2 main reasons to get his item.

1. Attack Speed. Being single target, shaco has always benifitted from some AS, as it also helps his clone DPS.

2. The Active. With Shaco's Q and SotD, he is guaranteed 4 Critical Strikes on his target. In a mid game team fight (Assume wriggles, boots 2, SotD), Shaco need only Q to a squishy, aa, activate SotD, 3xaa, then finish them with E. He can honestly 100-0 most carries in a single rotation with these 4 crits, especially if he has ignite.

The new **Black Cleaver**: On hit builds, while not so popular, have typically been rather strong on Shaco due to the nature of his clone. With the new BC, although Shaco cannot use it with his spells, I find that in small skirmishes with his clone, those 4 BC stacks are added very quickly. And while it lacks attack speed, the additional stats are everything that Shaco wants.

**Blade of the Ruined King**: Another absolutely amazing item. Again, this applies to the use of Shaco's clone, but if one can make use of it, this item is simply a must. The clone appiles the passive, so on a single target, you and your clone deal 8% HP for every AA together. (not to mention base damage or crits).~ If we forgo the 2%, Shaco can basically 100-0 anyone with only 10xAA from him and his clone together.~

**Guardian Angel**: Despite the nerfs, I believe this item will still remain core on Shaco. Not too much to say here. There are other defensive options (the new QSS upgrade) but GA still seems to fit Shaco best overall.

**End Notes:**

My typical end game build as of now is usually: Wriggles, Beserkers, SotD, BotRK, GA, Black Cleaver.

This build in particular gives amazing burst, while still leaving Shaco fairly tanky. With the %HP damage and armour reduction, Shaco is even well equipped to take down tankier targets.

Maw is still a very good option, but now that Shaco is getting more gold, he can start building more like a carry. (We may even see a lot more trinity force).

I have also been playing around with the new Tiamat and and its upgrade. It is really nice to have in the jungle, especially if you are facing off against a speed clearer like Shyv or Mundo. However I am not sure how I feel about it outside of that.

A nice aspect is that you can Q into a team, and get an instant AoE crit (similar to using Battlefury in Dota). With his clone this also adds a bit of teamfight AoE, so it could be very viable. But as of yet I'm not entirely sure.

**TL;DR** Shaco will love Season 3, both in terms of jungling and item options. There is much in store for our beloved little clown, and he may again return to top ban status.  &gt;:)


So, with what I have said here, please comment, critique, and discuss anything you have seen, tested, or think may be applicable to Shaco in season 3! Perhaps we may even see the rise of Shaco mid?

I like to think that i am good at analyzing teams, during the loading screen I look and think about how a team fight will ideally go. I am usually correct, I mean I don't think it is a hard skill to learn but it is one most people ignore.

I have trouble guiding my team in fights. I usually try and say a general plan at the start like ""In team fights I will Zac ult their front line, Kha dive their squishies and Lux and Ali work on their front line/initiators"" or something like that. 

I have trouble gaining trust, I know that wording is very important but I can't seem to get people to agree with me. They think my plan is shit, they think I suck and they will willfully ignore me.

A very recent example is when we kept going even in team fights or slightly losing them because someone would get caught. I think it happened too many times and we just fell behind too far but I kept saying ""Guys lets just play safe, don't overextend and just play safe""

Our ADC got caught and we had to fight another 4 v 5 fight on a tower, I think people were thinking I was talking shit to them when I said play more careful but I really meant it. I just wanted a straight 5v5 fight.

Anyways at the end of the game I was Sejunai and was pretty tanky. I was infront and they used 3 ults on me, my team ran and didn't fight. I actually almost killed 2 of them when I used all my abilities and I think Lux through down a few spells (no ult) but I died and my team just talked shit to me as they ran away.

They said I am a fucking joke, that I am horrible and that I suck and they probably reported me for all I know. I instantly lost any authority in that game.

I thought what I did was a good call, they said I got caught but I didn't see it that way. I saw it as a perfect engage for our team, they blew all their cooldowns on me. I think it would have worked if everyone engaged but that didn't happen, my team just ran.

I know to become a leader in this game you have to lead by example and show your team that you can do a good job of it. I feel like I can do this but when my team plays poorly it doesn't matter how good of a decision I make, they just hang me out to dry and my credibility is shot.

Maybe a little bit more about myself, I like to come off as someone who has fun. I joke around at the start a bit but I also try and get down to business talking strategy and reminding people of certain things about the enemy jungler or whatever or who has TP or maybe if lolnexus told me anything especially important.

So i have been wondering, Solo que, the most difficult role imo for people to perform well in, and add that to their rough early games (squishyness, lackluster dmg in short skirmishes, rarely have CC) I am starting to believe Bruisers will start shining in the bot lane, in replacement of the ADC.  

A Vi or Jayce early game, can literally just eat poke and WALK up to an ADC and support and just kill the ADC.

I feel like having your bot lane bruiser perform the role of ""anti ADC"" where it is pretty much their job to shut down an ADC (got the idea from Siv HDs recent video of him picking on the enemy Ashe) and going into late game with a pretty fed bottom lane bruiser.  

I am having a very rough time seeing how ADCs are still a must have on a team now, they are too weak for too long for me to justify using them now.  


Vi, Xin, Jayce, and Voliabear where my 4 guys I would take bottom, along with my buddy playing support as w/e he wants. The whole point would be to just bully the ADC out of lane early, like lvl 2 all ins on them. Blitz, Ali, and Thresh being the big 3 supports (obviously) just to help keep them from under the tower.  


A build for a bottom lane would be something like ""cloth 5"" rushing a D Shield or D blade, and a Gbelt, then building a dmg item before finishing a Wmogs. A Tabi + Shield would make a decent farmed ADC in lane do no dmg to you, and that is only a 1300g~ investment.

She may be one of the hardest champs to use properly, on the same lines as ori, so I have a feeling she'll be ignored as a strong pick for a long time coming, but her damage/utility is amazing.

Getting all the balls out before using it isn't usually necessary to burst someone because you can get a stun in at the same time and hit with a W to slow and then get some easy Q's in as well.

Questions though for who has been playing her. What's you're typical builds? I generally rush Athene's then go for Dcap/void for max burst.

My solution to this is Urgot. Urgot has a 900 range lock on ability (E) and a 1200 range targeted ability once E is locked on. With these two skills laning against Draven can become very simple. Look for where is axe is going to land and use E. If he catches that axe you can now spam Q on him until he is out of the 1200 range. If he forces a hard engage on you just Q him once for the damage reduction, pop W and retreat. Over time you can poke him down or force him to drop an axe and eventually zone him off of farm for good.

I was jungling Vi, darius was our top. I ganked a few times early, but he just goes right back there.

Darius couldn't handle him, so I'm spending all my time trying to slow him down, never able to kill him after RoA.

Then at like level 8 he is in our base killing waves of minions.  Me and Darius can't kill him, he just ults/ghosts and runs.  
So we come back with 3 or 4, he is worth no money but we had to stop him - enemy takes a tower or a dragon.


Eventually we are just losing towers and objectives left and right, a big part of it down to him.

How do we deal with him?

I'm thinking if I were to face it again now, I'd go for a couple of early ganks then ignore him and try and push middle/bottom.

Mediocre player here (1100-1300 ELO). I've been building Varus slightly differently than the standard IE+PD+LW AD carry build since he came out, and I've found it to not only be quite successful, but hella fun!

My first 21K gold always goes to the standard and safe 2 Dorans Blades, Vamp Scepter and Berserker Greaves. After that is where I mix things up. 

95% of the time, I'll get B.F.Sword next. I turn that into Bloodthirster if I need the sustain. If not, it get turned into Black Cleaver. I follow that up with Malady. Sometimes (rarely) I'll switch and get Malady first, but that's rare. Once I have BC, Mal and BT; I sell my Dorans for a Quick Silver Sash, and finish the build off with a Phantom Dancer.

Final build looks like: QSS, Malady, BC, BT, PD, BzG.

So to explain the method behind my madness:

1) Varus benefits very well from AS. It lets him get more W stacks on an enemy faster, and pop them with abilities quickly. I already attack crazy fast with just picking up 2 Daggers, but when BC and Malady are done... whoa momma! Dat AS!!!

2) In team fights, having BC and Malady benefits the team nicely. I may not be doing the raw, powerful damage of IE+PD+LW, but with BC and Mal, I'm applying stacks of armor pen and magic pen. This causes me to do less damage on my own, but my team as a whole can melt down our target faster. Even tanky champs don't last very long (unless they have really heavy defenses like FH, Randuins and a SFC)

3) Varus does (a little) magic damage with each attack. I want to capitalize on this, as it's something that makes him unique. Even compared to other ADC's with magic damage potential (Ez, Trist and Cork) Varus's kit and ability are quite different. I also run slightly weird masteries to help this build (12 in utility to get increased spellvamp for sustain, 4 in defense for early armor and improved heal, and the rest into standard AD in the offence tree). 

So, give me some feedback and let me know what you think. I encourage people to try it out at least once, even if you don't think it's optimal.

**DISCALIMER** If I'm in a serious business game, and my allies don't want me dicking around with weird builds, I'll go IE+PD+LW no problem, or grab a different carry in champ select. Same if an enemy is really stacking the armor, I'll get LW so that I don't fall behind in damage. I wouldn't want to hold my team back. But if no one minds what I do... Well, let's just say I've never received any complaints ;) .

Just something I thought about and wanted to share so that I can get some feedback. If you like cute yordles, please do stick around.

-

**Masteries** are 9/0/21, standard caster masteries, taking points into **ghost** and **exhaust**, movespeed and mana per 5.

**Runes** are MPen reds, MP5 yellows and CDR blues, with MS quints.

MPen reds are there to maximize shroom damage output.
MP5 yellows are to solve your mana problems, as you'll be shrooming all over the place. If you don't feel that you need those for some reason, you can swap them out for any other stat that benefits this build. Armor or dodge are okay, but you shouldn't be getting hit in the first place.
CDR blues are since shroom charges are affected by CDR, and you want to put out as many of them as possible.
Finally, I feel that movespeed quints are self explanatory. If you absolutely can't afford them, swap them out for MPen quints. But even one or two MS quints will be better than none.

-

This build is aimed towards the **fastest movespeed possible**, and as such leaves Teemo extremely squishy.
However, to make up for that I make sure to have so many escape tools that I'll be nearly impossible to catch with just one or two enemies.

If their whole team chases me down chances are they *will* eventually manage to kill me, but at this case my own team would be free to cap all points, which is exactly what I was trying to achieve in the first place.

I feel that Flash isn't very versatile on the Crystal Scar, and an already mobile champion such as Teemo simply doesn't benefit from it as much as others. If you're escaping from an enemy, on top of your natural ridiculously high movespeed, you'll have ghost, exhaust, your W, your shrooms, and Rylai's proc on your Q (which has a fairly good range). Let's not forget a two-second activation stealth mode that can drive. Them. Nuts.

As *jtiza* has pointed out in the comments, intelligent use of your cooldowns on speed boosts (Move Quick, Ghost, and Priscilla's) as well as those on your enemy-impairing moves (Exhaust, Blinding Dart and Shrooms (the latter two with Rylai's proc)) is crucial to your survival. I wouldn't recommend using W every time it's up just to traverse the map faster, unless you have superb map awareness - it may cost you a failed escape. The only thing you should be spamming whenever it's off-cooldown is your shrooms, preferably all over the map.

-

I feel that the two most important items for this build are **Boots of Mobility** and **Morello's Evil Tome**. They provide everything that you need, and they provide good amounts of it. 

Next up are **Rylai's Crystal Scepter** (which honestly I'd consider as core) and Lich Bane for more damage, mana, movespeed and an AMAZING slow on your shrooms.

A suggestion that I saw coming up a lot in the comments is to include a **Priscilla's Blessing**. After thinking about it, it does sound like a good idea, though if you're gonna get it make sure to grab it *relatively early* in the game.

If you don't find yourself to be sufficiently swift, grab a Zeal somewhere inbetween. You could always sell it later. Another option is to build a Force of Nature, but I feel that it doesn't contribute that much to my intended playstyle with this build (as well as being less cost-effective).

To round out your damage to *really* annoying levels, grab a Void Staff and (if possible) another offensive item of choice. Rabadon's would be good if your income allows it.

-

**Early game**, you want to be 'that sneaky little fuck'. I don't care if you actually achieve something, I just want you to *be everywhere at once*. Pretend to ninja cap a spot just to lure one or two of them there, then stealth and BP, repeat until 6. Make your enemy develop a hatred towards you, so that whenever you do pop up, they always go hunting for you. Waste their time as much as you can. And if they start ignoring you, make them pay for it. Instead of pretending to ninja cap, actually do it. That'll show 'em.

**Once you hit 6**, that's where the real shitstorm begins. At this point your one and only job is to roam the map and *SHROOM ALL THE THINGS*, especially all the passageways inbetween lanes and at the central part of the map. Shroom their greater relic, every time they'll try capping it the shroom poison will prevent them from channeling for a few seconds.

Shrooming -on- enemy nodes is pointless, as turrets have true sight and as such the enemies will see those shrooms. However, shrooming around a point, starting from about 200 range from its circle, will benefit your team a lot. Shrooming friendly points is always a great idea.

And most importantly, *shroom the health boosts and speed buffs*. It will outright negate them. Speed boost to get to a point quickly? DENIED. I'm about to die, so I'll grab this healt- OSHIT I'M DEAD. These are true, frustrated players' testimonies.

One of two things will happen once you've started filling the map with your mushrooms.

In one scenario the enemy team will realize how much you're hindering their progress, and they'll either spend gold on Oracle's extract (and spend time looking for your shrooms to destroy them), or prioritize YOU as a target. This is excellent, because whether they succeed in doing that or don't, you've accomplished what you were trying to. They've left their points more vulnerable to captures.

In the other scenario, they will continue ignoring your presence, and that's also great (although, admittedly, not as great). It will give you the chance to shroom more, and if you feel for one moment that they don't give a fuck, go back to your early game habit of ninja capping their points. Either succeed and get a point, or fail but get them to waste resources hunting you down (bonus points if you escape).

-

That's about it. I'll be honest, I'm writing this at work with no idea if it would actually be viable against any semi-adapting team, but I can't think of a reason why it shouldn't. Let me know what you think, and any constructive criticism is always welcome. :)

It ended up working out beautifully as he took first blood and got way ahead of vicious from there.

Mind you this was with no lifesteal quints, so he essentially had no sustain. The reason it worked was because Nintendude knew what was going to happen as soon as stvicious took jungle Nasus.

Jungle Nasus early strength is the ability to push an immediate tower in the 2 v 1 lane. To counter this Jarvan cleared his buffs, and headed over to help ZionSpartan (Riven) and make the lane a 3 v 2 with Jarvan and Riven defending with Ezreal, Thresh and Nasus putting the siege on. 

The Dorans blade made him more efficient there against Nasus who took standard start (machete + pots) because of the lack of gold ""wasted"" on potions. They held out defending the tower and eventually Nintendude got first blood on EDward. 

This allowed him to go double dorans, adding another damage threat from coast. This led to two early towers for Coast which snowballed the game from there.

What are your thoughts on the start?

Do you think it could be a decent counter to the tower pushing meta?

Does Nintendude building more damage recently show that Coast is improving and going away from just 'tank for Zion' mentality?

To start off with I want to clarify: I don't think Sivir is as bad as people think, and doesn't need all that many changes to be a viable AD.

I personally believe Sivir's problems lie with her terrible base HP (considering her range) and her terrible mana costs.

Currently Sivir has a base HP of 378, and she has a range of 500. Caitlyn had a base HP of 390 and a range of 650. I think this is stupid. Sivirs base HP should be more in line with MFs base HP of 435 considering her short range. I don't think her range needs buffing, but I think she needs a little bit more defense to make up for that. Something that could be a QoL buff to Sivir that I just thought of now would be to give her the ability to recall her boomerang. It would require skill on the Sivirs part to execute, and make it easier to try get a double hit at medium/close range where normally it's near impossible. The other part I would change would be to give her some lower mana costs with maybe a bit of a buff to her base HP. It can be hard farming with Sivir with just autos due to your shit range, and to make up for it you generally want to use your skills, but her shit base mana pool + fairly high cost means that you have to be a lot more conservative than I think she should have to be. My possible changes:

Base HP increased to 420.

Base mana pool increased to 250

Boomerang blade mana cost decreased to 60/65/70/75/80

Ricochet mana cost decreased to 30 at all levels

Boomerang blade can now be recalled by pressing Q a second time

I'm not saying don't suggest alternate supports, thing's like zyra were originally all APC. However, please begin your topic with how your support's kit brings more what than a current 'viable' support. 

Do realise that supports offer various trump cards that make them good support.

1. A lot of utility, MINIMUM 2 (cc, vision etc.)
2. They have a way to physically support a champion (heal, shield)
3. They require very little reliance items to scale.
4. They have some sort of poke/harass/engage/self sustain/trade abilities.

Most of support champions suggested here only fit the bill on #4. If you have #4 and the other support wins at all the other points then your support isn't viable, it's as simple as that.

Take a recent example, support karthus, let say, vs support nunu who does a similar thing

1. aoe Slow, q  vision (Sort of) vs low cdr slow, aoe slow, w speed, nunu also has free spell utility. 
2. 0 vs nunu w AS
3. every single spell nunu has scales better than karthus without items. karthus has a global ult which is easier to hit, i'll give you that one. that makes 1 vs 3, nunu wins.
4. Ok karthus probably has better poke, but nunu's sustain and his poke probably makes him a better #4 overall. 

Even if karthus gets to #4, nunu is still an overall better support in whatever you are looking to achieve. Note most things nunu does are similar to what karthus does except he does it better and adds more. 

edit: I'd like to think that things suggested in this subreddit are not just theory crafted, but put to use. You might have had success with a support karthus, sion, or whatever, however if we wish to replicate this we might find it very difficult. Therefore, when making topics for new supports, try to convince us why we should pick yours instead of the ones available.

So why play standard? Instead stack siege and aura items, and control the objectives of the game. Objectives win games.

Banner of Command is an obvious pick. If you are already naturally pushing hard, may as well emphasize that. Notably, you can Promote a side lane and hold off the siege of your mid tower.

Will of the Ancients will also give you siege power, while also giving you AP. Heimerdinger would likely start with a Chalice, which would become Athene's. You will also want Aegis, Soul Shroud, and Ohmwrecker somewhere on your team. Since you are picking between Flash/Ghost/Teleport, Boots of Distortion are great choice.

Caitlyn is a great pick for an accomplice. The ability to safely hit towers is invaluable, and traps help zone. AP Nidalee top is also a great fit in what is essentially a poke/siege comp, and gives your team AP when Siegemerdinger might lack. Sona/Nami seem like the best choices for disengaging supports. A jungler that wants to have Frozen Fist and Randuins so your carries can kite like mad. Perhaps Nautilis or Sejuani, if they are relevant in new jungle.

&gt; - Unique Passive - Refresh (Ward) : Starts with 4 charges and refills each time you stop by your shop.

&gt; - Unique Active - Ghost Ward: Consumes a charge to place an invisible ward that reveals the surrounding area for 3 minutes. You may have a maximum of 2 wards from this item at once.﻿

With the removal of HoG, Sightstone is set to become the go-to HP/pseudo-GP/10 item for supports, tops, junglers and possibly mids. This means a lot more vision all over the map and will surely affect the meta for almost every role.

Let's start with jungle. I think the increase in vision will help bring stealth assassin junglers (Eve &amp; Twitch) back into favour. Twitch in particular will benefit from the S3 jungle remake, which buffs single-target junglers, as well as the Hunter's Machete item which will synergize well with his passive. On the other hand, ward spam could just solidify the current tanky utility jungler meta as having an Oracle's holder who is not easy to kill becomes more important.

Bot lane will become a lot safer and thus more diverse when it comes to viable AD carries, as having a blink/dash will no longer be mandatory. I think Draven will get a lot more play, as well as Varus &amp; Twitch, both of who will be able to make great use of the new [Runaan's Hurricane](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=31408179#post31408179) item.

In mid, I reckon Eve will be considered a strong pick despite the nerfs to her ult and DFG. TF will be stronger as well. Apart from that, I dunno... is it possible we'll see some mids running TP to be able to gank sidelanes without being spotted?

Top won't change too much I don't think, although characters that benefit from having lots of wards on the map - such as Jax &amp; Lee Sin - might become more popular. A safer toplane may also lead to a larger pool of viable AP tops.

1352226611.0,30,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,12qpz9,Tri-Jungles or: How I learned to  stop worrying and love the gank,KingDunco,41,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/12qpz9/trijungles_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and/,"Introduction:
I would like to preface this by mentioning that this strategy is in no way meant to be played in a ranked game, and should always be done in a group of 5 willing players so as to not ruin someone's experience. You should always be courteous to your teammates wishes when picking a strategy like this. Also the entire team has a large pat in the tri-jungle strategy and so it is recommended that you be on some sort of voice communication while you play.  
  
 The tri-jungle strategy is one that is very touchy by all means, and requires not only your three junglers to be on the very top of their game but also to have all five players playing carefully and attentively.  The most important aspect is that at all times there must be at least 1 of your junglers available to run into mid.  This strategy excels in shutting down the enemy champions,  counter-jungling, and quick pushes.  Know that the strategy becomes less effective if you do not make the most of your early game advantage.  If you fail to take full advantage then you will quickly fall behind in the game.  

Team Comp:
Team comp is difficult to create for this strategy.  
There are a number of requirements that must be met:

* A quick clearing and safe bot laner(he will be playing 1v2)  Vlad works well

* A strong top lane champion that fits to go against their lane opponent(this and bottom should be picked last)

* A support style champion in the jungle(nunu is a very strong pick)

* A Movement speed champion with a fast clear to help maintain your empty lane

* A champion with hard cc(stuns, snares, knock-ups)

These guidelines must all be met and if possible there should two cc's and at least 1 dash in your composition.  Slows are also helpful in your jungle trio as they will guarantee your kills. Nunu excels in the support jungle role as he does not require smite, and as such can carry an extra offensive summoner spell in your jungle.  

For bot lane characters that are traditional picks on a top and bottom lane switch are also viable in this composition.  The point is to put someone who can safely farm and push minions away from tower until the ganks are available from your jungle.  In my experience Vlad is a very strong pick for this as he can survive and push out quickly to avoid much damage to the tower.  When done correctly the early game farm period should not last for very long.  

The jungle group must be able to be split into 2, a single character who will take blue at level 1, and a pair of junglers who will take red and wraiths.  The buffs taken by each group can be switched if you want to give an auto-attacking champion like J4 a second level to get his lance-knock-up combo for the 1st gank.  Once you have cleared the blue and red sides of jungle you will want to rush mid, after all, you have no mid laner.  When done properly the mid lane kill should be guaranteed at level 1, as almost no one expects the 3 jungle gank to come from 2 sides, and they will undoubtedly be pushed past the mid point of the lane.  

Game Progression; Early Game:
As Previously stated this strategy gets weaker as the game goes on and so every stage of the game matters, although the hope is that you will be rushing into mid and late game much sooner than when playing a traditional team composition.  This starts as soon as your level 1/2 gank has been performed.  The next move is to usually move into the enemy jungle,  At this time the enemy jungler will not have finished their first clear and will be vulnerable to a gank. 

 Moving on from the jungle the nearest lane should be a priority.  On blue side this will usually be the top lane, for purple the usual would be bot, assuming that your jungle gank occurred around the enemy's Red camp.  In both situations you will be either 4v1 or 4v2 and this is a very strong advantage.  If you happened to choice lane champions with hard cc as well then the gank should be very easy.  It is very important that after your gank in this lane that you push, and damage the tower as much as you can with a best case scenario of taking the first tower of the game at this point.  

This is the point in the game that you need to make absolutely sure to keep the pressure on the rest of the map, starting with mid lane.  The mid lane champion on the enemy team will have respawned by now and is either trying to  aid their teammates or farming up the empty mid lane.  Send at least 2 of your junglers to mid lane and have the third clear the small camps on his way towards your un-ganked lane.  Clear mid and try to push the enemy out of lane, a kill is the prefered result, to stop them from farming.  It is absolutely vital that you do not leave mid lane alone for any prolonged period of time, and remove their mid from lane as often as possible.  Once you have pushed back mid, or killed the lane opponent follow your 3rd jungler out of the jungle into the un-ganked lane.  If that lane is ungankable at this time then you should put as much damage onto mid lanes turret as possible and send your third jungle into the enemy jungle,  you should have 2 smites on your team so using one to take larger creeps is fine.  

At this point the first dragon of the game should be spawning soon, and with your early map control and multiple smites you should take it down without any problems.  After you have taken down the dragon you should continue the high mobility gameplay while separating your junglers as need be in an attempt to take down the enemies' 3 outer towers, and keep their mid underfarmed.  

Game Progression; Mid and late game:

This is a point which is difficult to mark in the game.  I usually count the progression into mid game under when you have taken down the 3 outer towers and at least 1 dragon.  With the 190 gold from dragon and the 150x3 gold from the towers you should be at least 540 gold ahead and if you have managed to pick up any kills in your ganks rather than just pushing enemies out of the lane then your lead should be even more.  In this point you want to keep the pressure on your enemies.  Mid lane will be the obvious focus with at least 1 jungler taking camps or ganking at all times.  Staying in lane should only be done when you have the ability to push to a tower, at which point you should move into the jungle(yours or your enemy's).  Clearing your camps gives you the obvious gold and experience, and clearing the enemy camps continues your starvation of their resources.  With 3 turrets down your 2 laners will be able to move around with you giving you even stronger ganks, and a significantly higher amount of map control.  From this point on in the game you must push hard to take towers and get every dragon possible.  Keep the enemies on the defensive and don't let them farm up.  You can control their resources and remove them from lane at will, and you should do this whenever possible.  

Conclusion:

This strategy is definitely not one for a ranked play, but is definitely a fun one, and when pulled of correctly can be an unexpected and devastating play.  There are great risks with this strategy, the largest being that you do not push the advantage given to you early game, and allow them to catch up to your team.  The 2nd risk is to allow the mid lane free farm.  The main counter that this strategy has to that is to gank often, and to have 1 jungler have a large movement speed buff.   Hecarim is great as he can get to the lane and clear it very quickly, and with a nunu also in the jungle he will get to any point in the map in no time.  I hope that this strategy is something that you can try for fun, as me and my friends have enjoyed it very much.

So I did some serious theory crafting and came up with a better overall strategy. Here are my thoughts. 

* Apply pressure. 
 
I started applying pressure on my enemy and their tower from level 1. Most enemies don't expect this and will try to either gank you or camp top. This is what you want to happen. Having the enemy jungler or mid constantly coming top will help keep them away from bot and dragon, and you *need* this to happen if you want to win. If they are going bot and invading jungle and killing your mid, you'd better be pushing extremely hard at all times. 

* Play champs who are relevant from level 1 to level 18. 

My favorite picks so far are Shyvana, Jayce, Gragas, Hecarim, and Nidalee. Why? Because they can push a lane hard if needed with some form or Aoe, they all have some form of mobility and escape so they can get away from ganks, they all scale well when it comes to late game because of different reasons (Shyvana/Hecarim initiation, Gragas damage, Jayce helps team mobility, Nidalee because split push all day).  

* Push always. 

If you are ever *not* pushing your lane you are doing it wrong. In this day and age of the game winning top means you are demanding the other team's attention at all times. You need to be doing something they are always trying to stop. If they choose to not come stop you? TAKE THEIR TOWERS ALL THE WAY TO THEIR INHIB. I've had at least 6 games playing Shyvana where I never stopped pushing the lane, and even if I died to my enemy laner I would buy some armor/mr and get right back to it. Never let up, never let them leave you alone, and don't leave lane unless it's to help your team with objectives or defend. 

* Be tanky. 

You should always be reasonably tanky as a top laner these days. Usually with the emphasis on assassins and ADCs being the main damage of most teams you're going to be the person who should be in the middle of a fight. Shyvana and Hecarim excel at this role, as does Malphite and other tanky tops like Olaf. Being able to shrug off the ADC's damage because you have Randuins or F.Heart is extremely important, and since most junglers aren't going to have the gold to get these big items early on, it falls on you in most games. 

* Farm hard. 

Have some good AoE clear, practice getting every single creep in a wave and then back off to let the next wave come. Then repeat. Having someone with low mana costs or none at all will excel at this role (Shyvana yet again). While each wave comes you've got about a 15-20 second window to leave and do something before they get back. Your quick runs into the jungle or to mid lane shouldn't last very long, but you should still do them so you're never easily ganked. Stay mobile, and don't fall behind in farm. 

If the enemy freezes the lane? Fight them. Harass them. Get them to move and keep them on the defensive. It's not easy, but if done you can dominate almost anyone. Especially champs who can't quickly clear a minion wave without burning a large amount of mana. 

* Don't pick to counter, pick to synergize. 

Literally, in almost every single game I play top people mention counters and which champs beat others. This is an easy way to lose games since instead of planning to do well with your team, you plan to beat your lane opponent. While this can help you win lane, it will not help you win the game since you will usually lack combos with your team. Example: You're facing Singed top and you decide to play Teemo since he does so well against Singed, you kill Singed a couple times and are doing great. That is, until Singed decides to Tele-gank bot and get dragon with his team after getting a double kill bot lane while you spent your time farming and trying to push. Now you're behind in gold and the enemy bot lane is starting to snowball because the champ you picked doesn't have the map presence that Singed does or any kind of synergy when the teamfights and roaming starts. 

If you want synergy, just look at the people you will be fighting with most of the time. As a top laner you'll usually be fighting with the jungler or the AP mid, try to pick champs who do well when in a skirmish. If you have Lee jungle then play someone who can quickly close the gap so Lee can jump to you. If you have a Nunu jungle play someone who scales well with attack speed so you can fully benefit from a Blood Boil. Veigar mid? Play someone who can buy abyssal scepter so his burst will be amplified. Stuff like this will make teamfights so much more effective since you will work well with your team. 


* Ward crucial places. 

Early on (around when you get to level 6-8) the enemy buffs will spawn. Having them warded might let you catch the enemy jungler/mid by surprise and steal their buff. If you have your first recall, make sure to bring a ward or two just for this purpose. Stealing the second red/blue can let you win your lane even easier and deny the enemy their mid game power also. Not to mention you want to keep yourself safe by keeping tri-bush or river warded at all times. Vision wins games. 

* Disrupt other lanes/jungle camps. 

Basically, my strategy revolves around pushing and moving around the area of top lane and the two top jungles. Getting camps, stealing/warding buffs, and being back in lane in time to not miss much CS is hard, but can be done. 

Playing champs with mobility is crucial to this end, having a spammable MS boost with champs like Shyvana or Nidalee will allow you to roam with impunity and steal camps/annoy junglers. Staying at high health and moving around the map will get you ahead and keep you there. Even though this strategy is falling out of favor, you can still do it well if you ward and play strong champs.

I ask this because one of the most commonly cited reasons why Ziggs is considered underpowered/situational is because his escape/mobility skill, Satchel Charge, is quite clunky, for reasons such as:

*  Unlike other repositioning skills (e.g. Ezreal's Arcane Shift, Gragas slam), it can backfire badly or fizzle if you don't position yourself perfectly.
*  Enemy gap-closers (thinking Irelia/Xin style), it is aggravating to use, especially since these bruisers often carry slows that make positioning the Satchel between Ziggs and his would-be assassin very difficult.
*  Even when pulled off optimally, the combination of Zigg's long flight animation and the minimal knockback W provides (like Maokai Q without the slow) means oftentimes your attempts to escape prove meaningless if you didn't jump a wall.

I know that most APs don't have escape skills, but these often have some sort of reliable CC to make up for it (Rune Prison, Gold Card, Binding/Black Shield).

Naturally, I'm interested in Ziggs' balance and QoL as a whole (I'd love to see him more), but I'm not a heavy Ziggs player. My main question is: what do Ziggs players think of his W? Is the payoff worth it for what I feel seems like a lot of work?  Would you like to see changes?

He doesn't even really need to build health due to his R's bonus. His lane sustain is amazing, etc. etc. I guess to summarize, here are his pros/cons as I see it, and it confuses me as to why he isn't played more.

1340758234.0,29,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,vnrlt,A tip to all the AD carries having to deal with the enemy Alistar support. ,Aberax,39,10,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/vnrlt/a_tip_to_all_the_ad_carries_having_to_deal_with/,"TL;DR. Your AD carry starts boots/3pots to avoid early QW combos from alistar. On the very first back, you buy a brutalizer, and then start abusing alistar for getting too close. Support buys wards and places them in bush once AD has brutalizer, to start targetting alistar.
 
Say that you're a Tristana/Taric lane, faced up again Caitlyn/Alistar.  Alistar camps in the bushes all day, and caitlyn has too much range for you to initiate on without being offside. Alistar waits for you to try and initiate, and then does his combo. Q's you up, and then W's you into his AD carry, who blows you right up well your support watches hopelessly. 

What are the problems here?

1) Alistar is an incredibly tanky support, who can get right in your face without fear of your damage, because not only can he man mode it, but he can heal it right back. 

2) Alistar has control of the bushes, so you can't target him. He chooses when and where the fight happens. 

Two solutions, both have to be used simultaneously for the desired result. Your support needs to get wards, and your AD carry need to start boots/3 pots, and then rush a brutalizer. 

What did this do? Before, Alistar sat in the bush all day, because he simply could. He was both untargetable and unkillable. His skillset requires him to be at the front of every initiation. Now you can abuse this. Ward the bush, both bushes, and target him down. Make him waste his mana, make him scared. A low health Alistar can't initiate without you picking up an easy kill. He'll try to heal himself, leaving him with no mana. A low mana alistar can't save his carry, and can't deal any damage. This may not completely counter the lane, but it will definitely slow down alistar's game plan. However, sell the brutalizer once mid-late game starts.

This is only my recommendation, as a main support who mains alistar. Some may say that the brutalizer isn't worth it, and that it just slows down your build, and those people are right. The brutalizer does slow down your build, but it's a worthwhile investment, to set back the enemy ad and support. 

All I'm asking is try it, and leave feedback. I know reddit loves theory crafting, but I'd much rather hear about solid results. 

PS:Alistar is also countered by HARD cc supports. A slow isn't enough.

EDIT: Feel free to stick to your builds, fellas. This is just something to try, for those who feel frustrated after trying other strategies without the results they hoped for. And also, everything is situational. I wouldn't buy a brutalizer just because I see an alistar in lane. Like I said: I buy brutalizer when alistar is being overly aggressive and feels that he can get within range of the AD carry's auto attacks without repercussion.

A note on why I mentioned armor pen, compared to just damage. In solo queue, I don't think many people have personalized rune pages, but any dedicated alistar puts armor in their rune page. I run armor marks, seals, and sometimes even quints. 

ALSO ALSO (Your guys' comments give me a lot to think about) I wouldn't get brutalizer if you're behind, as it WILL slow down your itemization, because you DO have to sell it! I would get it if the lane is close, and that enemy alistar's armor may be the difference between winning and losing your lane.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1340768144.0,,,True,t3_vnrlt,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/vnrlt/a_tip_to_all_the_ad_carries_having_to_deal_with/,

He's currently one of the best top laners in the game right now. I recommend riding the train before the nerf bat hits. The problem is that Jax is weak in levels 1-6. The best way to succeed is to get jungle help early on, or gank a lane.

His counters include Pantheon, Vladimir, Warwick, Lee Sin, Riven, Wukong, and Olaf. If you manage to stay within 10-15 creeps, you will come out ahead.

**Runes:**

* 9x Armor Penetration Reds

* 9x Flat Armor Seals

* 9x Flat Magic Resist Blues

* 3x Flat Attack Damage Quintessences

**Masteries:** 

21/9/0

**Start:**

Boots + 4 HP Potions [Wait in spawn for 4th potion]

Cloth + 5 HP Potions

Null-Magic Mantle + 3 HP Potions [Wait in spawn for 3rd potion]

**Build:**

1. Mercury Treads or Ninja Tabi

2. Doran's Blade [2x Optional, but at least have 1]

3. Hextech Gunblade

4. Trinity Force

5. Randuin's Omen

6. Guardian's Angel or Last Whisper


* Maw of Malmortis [If enemy runs double AP, else skip]

* Quicksilver Sash [If too much CC, else skip]

**Situations:**

Against AP, make a Hexdrinker and Mercury Treads.

Against AD, make a Warden's Mail and Ninja Tabi.

**Example Gameplay:**

[Result of Example Game](http://i.imgur.com/InlWB.jpg)


In this game, Vladimir made sure to regularly freeze his lane because of his ranged harass. This person counter-picked me specifically, so he knows his lane advantage levels 1-6. I ganked mid at level 3 with Lee Sin and grabbed first blood. I farmed my top lane as best as I could, knowing that I won't get every creep. When Vladimir harassed me in tower range, I stunned him on time so the tower could aggro on him. These are basic tricks for top, especially if you play Irelia/Warwick.

**Tip #1: Force Objectives or Kills**

The secret to top lane is if your enemy freezes his lane, you go down to force dragons, or gank. If you can rally your team to do an early dragon, you put everyone +190 gold ahead.

**Tip #2: Mechanics:**

Abuse Jax's mechanics. His E+Q stun is the most broken thing ever. If you can land it in the right circumstances, you can pick up a kill.

**Tip #3: Communication and Team Fights**

Simple communication can win you the entire game. It's something so basic, but nobody does it. Just ping when you go in, so your teammate can follow up after you stun.

Try to focus the enemy ranged AD carry. E+Q stun can close the gap and stop the AD carry's DPS output. Jam R in every team fight, even if you think you already pressed it. Press R just in case.

**Tip #4: Laning after Level 6**

Hit a creep two times, E+Q your opponent and auto-attack for the 3rd proc. Then W to reset your attack.

EDIT: You can press W during your 3rd strike. The damage will combine. Feel free to mix up your harass method, so it is less obvious to your opponent.

If they are low, check your mana and go all-in. E+Q+R+W, and chase until your Q comes back up, then ignite.

**Tip #5: Buy an Excessive Amount of Wards**

Jax can leap to wards. It can save you from ganks and many other situations. They are also required for top lane, unless you are fed and 1v2 is no problem.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1338483909.0,,,True,t3_udu6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/udu6z/around_jax_never_relax/,

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, here's the game:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R3n1KIj7uk

Go to 23:20. Basically Janna wards the bush and then, together with Shyvana, semi-hide themselves from Warwick. Then they jump on him and chunk him, lowering his HP by a substantial amount. Then they proceed to steal the red, which they can do without much of a problem because it is 2v1 and the enemy jungler is chunked. If middle comes to help, their middle follows, same for top. Note how top is playing very aggressively and trying to chunk the enemy top as much as possible, which is usually not that hard because it is their ranged AD and most champions who go solotop cannot win trades against a ranged ad in the early levels (levels 1 and 2, possibly even later). After this they try to 3-man dive top for first blood.

Meanwhile, they have gangplank taking their own jungle. They seem to intentionally leave a little monster in their own jungle to prevent the camps from respawning, possibly to deny the enemy jungler if he would opt for an invade himself. I also believe that this is why GP gets red - not necessarily because he benefits so much from it, but so the enemy cannot counterjungle him. I believe that the main reason for leaving at least 1 monster is to prevent camp respawning instead of saving time. Why? Check out this:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlp40QHq4o

Go to 12:05. As you can see, a small wraith was intentionally left - it had nearly no hp and was obviously ignored on purpose. They employ the exact same strategy in this game, BTW, so I would recommend watching this as well.

That being said, I was wondering what the counter would be for this. M5 isn't using it in every game and in an interview after the m5 vs. ehome match they said they used it because they thought ehome forgot/wasn't aware of this strategy, implying that it has a counter. They also rarely use it, further emphasizing the fact that there is a counter.

The botlane - Gangplank in their case - jungles extremely low HP. However, I have tested if it is possible to invade the red buff and stop gangplank (or whatever botlane) from doing it. This is not possible unless you b-line it to their red as soon as the first wave of melee creeps connect, not taking any CS at all, and even then it is close.

The problem seems to be magnified when you have a jungler who cannot/will rarely gank at level 2 (rammus, warwick, maokai, ...,) and it doesn't seem to work if the enemy jungler can start at red.

--

That being said, I have been running this in ranked 5s and have yet to lose with it. We run Mordekaiser and Soraka in top and middle, seeing as they are very strong champions who can 1v1 pretty much anyone at levels 1 through 3 + autopush the wave, making the assisting in the enemy jungle and the possible dive even easier. The answer for these kind of champions is usually 'gank them', but with full awareness of where their jungler is and by hurting him so badly, AP soraka and morde top seem to be extremely hard to deal with if you cannot rely on the jungle to punish them for overextending.

With that being said, I was wondering how you would counter this strategy?",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_qq7sd,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/qq7sd/how_do_you_stop_the_m5_jungle_invasionsupport/,

The question is the fastest you can acquire a philo stone, usually, on champions that would consider getting GP10 boosters on.  We will assume on each of these tests that the champion bought Faerie Charm and used the rest of his/her gold.   

To attain a philo stone after faerie charm, you need 620 gold.  Assuming you do not take any CS and do not kill any wards in this time:

- With masteries gp10: **8:23**
- With quints and masteries gp10: **7:14**
- With all possible bonuses gp10: **6:36**

This was calculated with the 1:30 dead time at the beginning of the game.

Now lets say you want to go back and get boots/hog, as a lot of supports do, it will require 1175.  Assuming you purchased your philo stone at the absolute minimum time for each combination of items:

- With native gp10: **20:18** (on in game clock) [wow]

With Shurelya's, I can hit the active and send my team hurdling into the enemy to follow up on a Rupture or Twisted Advance, or to retreat after we've taken an inhib at their base and make a clean get away. The components for building the damn thing are even useful: The Philo Stone is a great GP5 item, and gives you strong sustain (I'll often start regrowth + pot) and the Kindlegem makes you a bit tankier early game, which is also sweet.

With Glacial Shroud, it's a solid armor item, plus it gives a good chunk of mana, too. It can build into a Frozen Heart which does work against right-click-to-win champs late game, but works really well for a stand alone item for about half the cost.

Lastly, lets not forget that with these two items (totaling just under 4k, which isn't too unreasonable to expect before midgame), combined with the ranks in the defensive masteries will get you damn close to the CDR cap. This means that in a team fight, you're going to be peeling off enemies left and right, with the mana to do it, and the tankiness to take the hits.

I have questions:

* I have been told that the first tic applys immediately when hit. So if you hit someone with 3 abilitys within half a second the initial 1% tic will have occurred 3 times (resetting the timer 2 times) is this right?

* On DOT abilities (singed acid, or malz space aids,) if you have Rylais and Liandrys, will every tick of the DOT restart the 3 second timer of liandrys and the 1.5 second timer of Rylais? 

So if malz aids lasts 3 seconds, will Liandrys burn for 5.5 seconds? And the first 4.5 seconds will continue to tick for Rylais?

* On AOE channel abilitys (karthus e, anivias Ult,) does Liandrys tick immediately when they take damage, and restart the tics everytime they take another tic of damage from the area channel?
 
Further into this; are all Of these spells the same .5 second tic? If anivias ult and cassiopeias W are cast .2 seconds after each other, and both champions have liandrys, are enemy's standing in both taking 4 tics every seconds? (1 at 0, 2 at .2, 3 at .5 and 4 at .7?) because if they're losing 12% hp, I'd like to know. 

* Is Liandrys a unique effect or just a unique passive? If 2 enemy's have Sunfire you'll take 2 times the damage, if two enemy's have liandrys will you burn double or just have the single debuff?

After yesterday's [article] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fr13f/get_what_you_paid_for_understanding_kits/), someone brought up that not everyone understands what kits are, so here's a rundown of just that.

A ""kit"" is a compilation of tools. The tools are **what the character's abilities can do.** Carries' kits are usually all about damage, how they can inflict more and more (usually some escapes so that they can keep themselves alive to deal more damage). Tanks kits' are usually designed around survivability,  with things like shields and HP/AR/MR bonuses, supports want utility in the form of speed, CC, walls, etc. and bruisers generally want a little bit of everything.

So let's look at the kit of someone **simple** like [Vlad] (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vladimir). *The next section is by no means exhaustive, and reading all of it might help some people, but for some of you will merely be tedious. If that is the case just read the first 5 paragraphs (his abilities) and then any other 3-5 and you should be able to get the idea.*

* Passive: HP scaling off of AP, AP scaling off of HP (This tells us he is designed to be a lategame character, since his passive is heavily item dependent. The idea is that it is weaker early, average-above average midgame, and strong late game). Also, he is manaless, which basically means he is better at long, drawn out engages and weaker in short, bursty ones, and late game he has an extra slot.

* Q: Single-target Damage and heal, long cooldown at first that gets very short with level. Not the best ratio, but when you consider the cooldown AND the fact that it heals independent of spellvamp it's quite strong with time.

* W: MS boost, untargetability. Primarily a self-peeling tool, can be used as soft CC very situationally, heals for a bit, but this is almost negligible considering the health cost. AOE Damage scales off of health, so it's quite counter intuitive to use this ability for damage (if you were to build health to increase it's damage you would have to use your only defensive spell to go aggressive with...) except very situationally.

* E: AOE Damage, increase self-healing abilities, get progressively better with each use up to 4 times (but also more expensive in terms oh hp cost). Low scaling but quick cooldown.

* R: Damage Amplification for 5 seconds and then ult damage hits, much like a zed ult, only this will amplify damage from all sources (baron, towers, minions, other allies, your own ignite, etc.).

* He is ranged, so he can easily harass melee champions, especially those who lack gapclosers (Singed, Nasus, Trundle), but his early game weakness and lack of dueling potential make him very weak to those with gapclosers (Irelia, Xin, Jax).

* His abilities are all pretty short range, which means he's going to take damage when he trades most of the time, but that's okay, he has healing and tankiness built in through his passive and q. Spellvamp is very good on him for this reason (as well as others).

* His damages aren't that great for bursting, but because of his short cooldowns and the increasing effectiveness of his Es, he excells at extended fights.

* Because he needs to last in fights to maximize his potential, he needs to be tanky, which his passive allows him to do. Spellvamp is really good on him for this reason (and because it replaces his health costs). Also, his W allows him to get off another set of abilities if used correctly.  A well-used Zhonya's is also allows for another set of cooldowns to be used.

* So, while he can do a lot of damage in addition to taking a lot, he needs items (spellvamp, Zhonya's, etc) to do this. He is both limited and empowered by his kit because it lets him be an AP hypercarry, while also being an off-tank, but only if he gets his items. Without them, he is very weak.

* R is a great engage tool, it should be used as soon in a fight as possible, and since he gets pretty tanky (a ""tool"" he gets from his passive) with multiple escape mechanisms (""tools"" he gets from his W and Zhonyas), he can do this. Because the damage is delayed, it is harder to use and less practical in a lot of situations than an ult with an immediate effect (Gragas, Katarina, Annie), in return, the damage amplification allows for more total damage. However, it is an AOE ult, making the individual damage less (compare to Veigar, Syndra, Mordekaiser), requiring it to hit 3+ targets to be ""worth"" in most contexts.

* His W will reset tower aggro so he can tower dive very well. It will also reset minion aggro. Depending on the mental state of the enemy team it may reset champion aggro as well. Because it makes him *untargetable* and not *invulnerable* he is very vulnerable to DoTs (e.g. ignite, Zilean bombs, posion, etc.), especially since it takes health to use, but it is still very good (with perfect timing) against things such as Caitlyn and Darius ults.

* E is very useful for clearing clearing minion waves, giving him some viability as a splitpusher. If you run ghost on him that viability increases significantly. In order to get Es off on multiple members of the enemy team you have to pretty much be in the middle of them, meaning you probably want to be in a dive comp so you don't get nuked right away, and pool/Zhonya use will be key.

* Q is his only single-target ability, also the first you should level because it gives the best 1v1 potential for laning, it will also increase his ability to sustain in lane, and is the only ability without a health cost (so you don't kill yourself laning. Because of the need to max this first his teamfight potential is largely delayed until L 13 when his E is maxed. Because it restores health as well as damages the enemy (and the fact he has no mana) he is very good at repeated trades. If Vlad can force trades with his opponent while still at early levels he can run them out of mana very quickly (the cooldown is very long at low levels, so he has to be trading as soon as the cd comes up, and using his autos along with his Qs).

* Because many of the tools in his kit (W,E,R) are multi-target, once he has any form of spellvamp he is good at fighting in  enemy minion waves because he can sustain back health (although he has to be careful of their damage if he uses autoattacks).

* Because he is reliant on getting close for a long time to get off multiple cooldowns he is quite susceptible to CC. There is also danger of getting tunnel vision that leads to being kited along viciously.

* Because his ult works well as an execute, ignite is not the best option usually (although I take it because I'm a bad Vlad and cant get kills without it). The damage amplification from the ult works with ignite, and gives him more dueling potential in lane.

* Because of the sustained damage that he can give, as well as his lack of gapclosers/CC, Ghost is a good option for chasing down kills. Because he isn't AD, he doesn't need to stop and auto attack, so its fairly easy to keep getting E+Q combos off (although they do stop his running), assuming you have a long distance over which you can run.

* Flash is very handy for escaping as well as jumping in to get off a combo to get a kill whether or not you are carrying ignite.

I think I could go on for a bit longer (and someone who is actually good at Vlad could go on for a long time), but you get the idea. Think about how well a character takes Baron/Dragon, how much they benefit from red/blue (Vlad can actually use red very well) buff, how fast they can clear each jungle camp at each stage of the game, how well they benefit from bush play, what items/summoners work well, etc. Every context that you can think of, think of how that champion's abilities could be used in it, and rate them as good, bad, great, terrible, or okay for each context. That is really what a character's kit is. In some ways, **the biggest limitation to a champion's kit is the summoner's imagination,** particularly at lower levels of play. 

Once you play this game for awhile, you begin to define character's by their kits: ""I think I'll try this champion because they have a lot of CC, can push well, and rock teamfights... what's their name again?"" A champion's kit does not define the teamcomp, just as a single tool in a champion's kit does not define the entire kit, but it does contribute to it. Maximizing a kit is dependent on a lot of variables, particularly the kits of your team, the enemy team, and the state of that game.

With the S3 changes and the abundance of wards, teleport on jungler would be really good. It bypasses enemy wards and it can be used on team wards. Teleport would then be used as an offensive move or countergank move or counterjungling move. Now when your team wards, it means much more than a ward; it means presence. Teleport also brings more or less what TF and Shen bring to the team. Their teleport mechanic is arguably the reason TF is high win rate solo queue and why Shen is so popular competitively. Also teleport can't be interrupted by champs if it is being used in the jungle.

But who is eligible for teleport? It is strongly recommended that the champion have a wall-jump or strong escape skill. The champion must also must be less reliant on flash than other champions. Fiddlesticks is a candidate does not fit either requirement: he needs flash to escape and his flash ult is really strong for him.

BotRK : 45 AD + 5% 
Bloodthirster: 100AD

via simple math (we can ignore resistances since both are physical damage) that's a difference of 55 AD, assuming that your champ only autoattacks (no damage from skills) 55AD @ 5%current health breaks even at Health *.05 = 55 or Health == 1100. That means it's effective when champs are above 2200 HP or when they buy a Warmogs. Note that we've ignored the active so the break even point is closer to 1950 on the champion  you use it on. I find that the effective break point is actually a little lower because typically people turn and run when they get low thus those early hits on multiple high-health targets is closer to what you actually do.

Why this matters? 

The pros are moving away from rushing Warmogs toward rushing Locket but for us plebian's I think it makes a great mid game item, especially on Tristana who has no AD scaling skills and is usually a little useless between the time she hits level 9ish and the time she has PD + IE. In a tiny sample size (3 games) rushing a BotRK made me effective in team fights before the 20 minute mark (when I typically get IE, a good games is ~16 min, a terrible one ~24 min). 

If you farm/kill better than me and can usually get the IE faster it may not be worth it but I'm curious if anyone else has tried this out and what they thought of it. I also plan to try it on Twitch because I think due to his ult that it could be massively effective as a first item when you anticipate an early teamfight.

1361230733.0,29,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,18s6dh,Spell vamp: A useless stat? (WALL OF TEXT),GVx,37,8,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/18s6dh/spell_vamp_a_useless_stat_wall_of_text/,"I want to discuss the viability of spell vamp on AP mids, due to the astounding cost efficiency of Spirit of the Spectral Wraith. Is it worthwhile to invest in as a stat?

I think it can be agreed that spell vamp is a defensive stat and currently the king of defensive stats is - HEALTH. Everybody and their mothers is health stacking, and a warmogs is good on everyone. To determine spell vamps ""worth"" we have to see if its cost efficient to just buying a giants belt and tanking it up.

*WARNING MATH INCOMING:*

By buying spirit of the spectral wraith, having spell vamp quints and masteries you can get **29% spell vamp.**

Spirit of the Spectral wraith is 2k gold. The revolver is 1.2k gold and the combine is 100, so lets say you're getting **20% spell vamp for 1.3k gold.**

Putting a cost on the runes is a bit of an estimate, but lets say that because you get 12% spell vamp from a revolver, and that costs 1200, and you're getting 6% from runes, the **the rune value is 600 gold**

Quantifying the cost of putting points into spell vamp in the utility tree is hard, because of the much greater opportunity cost. How far did you go in utility? What champion are you playing? What point in the game are you at, when you're calculating this cost efficiency. As such we'll leave this as an unknown, but fairly small variable, as the spell vamp provided is **only 3%**

So essentially, you have paid a little bit more than 1.6 k gold for 29% spell vamp and 40 ap. That same amount of gold also buys you a giants belt, ruby crystal, and then some. Those two items alone, **priced at 1,475 gold** gives you **560 health.** 

SO how much health do we have to ""vamp"" in one teamfight to make it worth the price we've paid? 

Using the formulas from here - http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Spell_vamp

We can see that:
When only casting single target spells - You must do around 700 damage AFTER resistances to justify the cost of the spell vamp items over health.

When only casting AOE/multi-target spells - You must do around 2800 damage AFTER resistances to justify the cost. 

So knowing this is it viable? I was running spirit on cass and ahri, but after doing the math for the multi target spell vamp its much less apealing. I dont think i'm doing THAT much damage. 

Do note that you are getting 40 ap for making your spectral wraith so that adds about 400 gold to cost efficiency. Even then you have to be putting out a LOT of damage to make worth buying just a giants belt.

TL;DR You have to put out around 700 single target damage, and 2800 multi target damage as an ap to justify buying spellvamp over hp.

Ezreal has been a unique adc since his release. Currently he does not perform outstanding in bot lane (still decent, not outstanding).

A utility based solo Ezreal build works very well. It is possible to play Blue Build Ezreal in mid lane very well. BB Ezreal also works in top lane and can somewhat jungle too.

The blue build is:

* Boots of Lucidity with Distortion

* Muramana

* Blade of the Ruined King

* Spirit of the Elder Lizard

* Iceborn Gauntlet

* Last Whisper

It does a lot of consistent damage. Any thoughts on it would be appreciated. The items alone give 35% cooldown reduction.

1365963387.0,26,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1cc4tk,AP Jax: A quick primer,Kraz226,40,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1cc4tk/ap_jax_a_quick_primer/,"I'll be blunt. Tried AP Jax out and I'm now building him that way in my standard ranked play. It feels much better overall than the old Trinity/Botrk/Gunblade, and I enjoy having the ability to get my big items early on and still scale well late game due to his passive and ult. 

Build goes something like this...

**Masteries: 15-15-0, or standard 21-9-0** 

15-15-0 is for tough lanes with really hard harass where you need the added tankiness that Unyielding and Block add. I'm usually fine with the 21-9-0 page (taking the usual AP half of the page) because it lets you bully people early on with your W.

**Runes: Flat AP Quints, Armor Yellows, Hybrid Penetration Reds, MR/lvl Blues**

This is the same page I use on Teemo, it's best for damage, tankiness, and scaling late game with the penetration runes. Hybrid pen is great on Jax, and the AP quints make your early game more bearable since your W will be doing a nice chunk of damage as long as you have the mana to use it. You can replace the blues with flat AP (or AP/lvl) if you're not going against any strong AP damage, but I think the MR/lvl is better. 

**Summoner Spells: Ghost/Ignite, Flash/Ignite, Barrier/Ignite, and Teleport/Ghost**

I run Ghost/Ignite most games. Jax's Q is so fantastic that you're not in dire need of Flash. Therefore, Ghost is better because of the shorter cooldown and the ability to chase people down for longer periods of time. Barrier/Ignite is for an All-In kind of attack where you just want to overpower people, or mitigate big burst damage come mid-late game. Teleport is self explanatory if you want more map presence or to split push once you get the Lich Bane. 

**Skill Order: R &gt; W &gt; Q &gt; E**

Standard fare here, W maxed first for the damage output. Q second for the cooldown reduction. And E is a one point wonder since it deals physical damage and isn't improved by added levels all that much. Obviously taking ranks in R when applicable. 

**Items:** *Lich Bane*, *Abyssal Scepter*, *Zhonya's*, Rod of Ages, Morellonomicon, Rylais, GA, Nashor's Tooth, Wit's End, Thornmail, Randuins, Frozen Fist, Sunfire Cape. 

(Core items highlighted)

These items are what I try to aim for in most games. There are obviously many ways you can change the builds around, but I've found these items work best for me. 

Lich Bane is obvious, Jax use a lot of abilities in short succession so the Spellblade passive proc is a must have. 

Besides that you have lots of choices to make. Enemy has lots of mages/magic damage? Abyssal or Wit's End work great. 

Enemy has big burst of initation or a bif AD presence? Zhonya's is your item. 

Jax can build just about any AP item in the game, but I've actually found Morellonomicon is great on him. Not only does it have 20% CDR for more Q and W uses, but the passive is great for an assassin type character like him. Not to mention it's much more gold efficient then many other items (including the recently nerfed cost on Nashor's). 

After trying out a bunch of items, I find that attack speed is a little lackluster. Rageblade feels useless even if it looks great on paper, Nashor's Tooth is good, but not gold efficient anymore, and Wit's End is strong but not as amazing since Abyssal is a better item overall for dealing and reducing magic damage since it's aoe rather than single target. 

The nice thing about Jax is that he doesn't really need any attack speed since his passive is so great, so you don't really need it but you can still build it if you so choose. I personally recommend Wit's End above the other AS choices listed here if you feel you need it, otherwise you can skip the stat altogether. 

**Early Game**

Early on you want a sustain item and a Sheen rush. I buy Flask in most games since it's still quite strong (especially on a character like Jax who is going to be burning mana frequently). Hextech Revolver is nice, but I'm not a fan of Gunblade these days. It is still good to grab early on since it's only a 1200 gold investment, but don't prioritize it over Sheen. You can also rush for a Catalyst as your first buy, and build it immediately into a RoA. This might sound odd, but getting this early on makes you incredibly tanky once it's stacked and lets you hammer away in lane with W without the fear of running out of mana. It also scales quite well since it's such a gold efficient item. However, don't bother getting it unless it will be your first or second major buy. 

If you're going up against a tough AD based opponent, then rush Ninja Tabis and a Seeker's armguard, the armor coupled with your ult will let you power through all your enemy's harass and still do enough damage to be a threat. 

**Mid-Late Game**

By now you want to at least have 1-2 full items done. Lich Bane is usually the first, followed by either Zhonya's or Abyssal Scepter in most cases. You can also obviously branch out and have other items done, but you want to be sure those make up the core of your build. 

Focus on diving carries in teamfights, your bust is exceptionally strong and your Ult will almost always give you enough time to finish people off. Just make sure not to jump in all alone, Jax might be tanky but he's not as tanky as some other bruisers when built this way. 

Late game you are very strong, but your strategy is the same. You should be diving carries and out-dueling anyone in small skirmishes. GA is a great item to have in late game teamfights since it allows you to dive hard and not care because your team will followup if you burn through the active. 



Thoughts? Has anyone tried this before me and has insight? I've done well with this build and want to hear what others think.

1365035938.0,28,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1bmlrd,Buying vision wards more frequently,tsarnicky,28,0,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1bmlrd/buying_vision_wards_more_frequently/,"**tl;dr:** I suggest pink wards should be bought more frequently (off the top of my head, around 50% of the time) and used around lane, not only at objectives.  This applies to all roles, in particular I'm interested in mid and top.

**Why I'd buy a pink:**

Pinks cost only 50g more than regular wards, that means if you get the kill on an enemy ward you only spent 25g more.  A kill gets your team a (guestimate) average of 300g+150g =450g.  That means your pink has to get you a kill one in every 18 buys to break even (once again that's assuming you killed the enemy ward and a teammate got an assist).

Whether or not your pink gets you a kill the vision ward denies enemy vision and so let's your team roam more easily, and makes taking objectives easier.  

**When I'd buy a pink:**

As my calculation above suggests it helps to know where your opponent warded.

My calculation also took into account assist money, so if you think you can 1v1 kill your lane pinks would be less helpful.

If you know an ally is snowballing and will want to roam, a pink could help them convert their lead into kills for your lane and the other lane.

Ward control is less important if your teammates have globals or can 'jump' over wards.  ex: I wouldn't buy pinks as frequently with nocturne or hecarim jungle.

1364230087.0,27,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1azcf9,I'm a Silver II player that picks a lot of unconventional roles for champions.  I'm curious on what other people think of the viability of these picks at higher Elos.,TimPowerGamer,33,6,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1azcf9/im_a_silver_ii_player_that_picks_a_lot_of/,"So, sometime towards the middle of last season, I ended up completely unable to take normal games seriously.  I pick roles for champions that don't go with what they would normally be doing otherwise, or sometimes I do themed lane comps.

Leona/Lux bot lane (Power of Light) - They both proc their passive when Lux is doing damage, and those procs hurt a ton.  Combined with excessive CC that can hold someone in place for nearly 4 seconds, I think this is a viable lane composition at all Elos.  With Caitlyn and Jayce both being able to ADC from other lanes (or jungle Ezreal/Twitch).  Alternatively, Lux could be made into an ADC (4 seconds of lockdown with bonus damage and ANYONE with a full AD build can kill you), but that's pushing on Crittlesticks' boundries of Fear, Thwap, Thwap, Thwap.  Hilarious, but probably not as effective as it could be.

Maoraka - AP Carry Maokai with support Soraka.  Maokai has a lot of natural sustain with his passive, and has one of the highest base damage skills in the game with Sapling.  His mana costs are his big laning problem, and Soraka curbs that completely.  Maokai's burst with 55 AP at level 5 is 571 for his combo.  (before MR)  Since you can poke them down with 1100 range Saplings, all you have to do is get a target to about 400 health and you can execute them.  If they decide to engage on you, who are they going to attack?  Soraka gives you 16 MR, an Armor increasing heal, all of those abilities give you the ability to heal yourself by auto-attacking, and Maokai wants people to fight him because he deals most of his damage by being right on top of you.  Certain comps counter this, though.  Volibear can eat sapling all day if he has some MR runes/masteries on, and dual bruiser bottom can wreck our shit if they get aggressive before Maokai hits level 3.

Support (Glass Cannon AP Hypercarry Assassin) Poppy - I'm really good with Poppy and I love playing her, but I can't take her top lane in blind pick because just about everyone beats her top lane.  I still wanted to play her, though, so I've been playing her in a way that completely ignores her farming weaknesses and her inability to handle a lot of strong top laners.  Poppy does a great job of abusing brush control and when combined with Vayne, can cause anyone out of position to get destroyed.  Very weak to poke comps unless you can get someone to go balls deep with you or have a lot of coordination with your jungler.

Support Anivia - This is a Vayne/Cait support primarily (Caitlyn for zone control by cutting off their path around the wall with her traps, Vayne to condemn the enemies into the Anivia wall).  Her mana costs are too high, and I played against a Caitlyn who used her net to get over my wall every single time I cast it like she had played against bird as Caitlyn every match-up of her life.  @_@  Anyway, if they can't jump over your wall, you put the wall up, Vayne condemns them, then you time your stun on top of them so they're stuck for the free Vayne kill.

Bruiser Varus - This is the one I have the most hope for.  While there's pretty much no reason to play Bruiser Varus top lane since Jayce does most of what Varus does, only he does it a little better, I started to play this build before Jayce came out.  Here's what I do with it and why it works for me.  If I'm blind pick, I can pick whatever resistance item I need against my opponent.  If they have an Elise, Akali, Rumble, you can start with a null-magic and rush your Merc Treads.  If they have an AD champion, you can start Cloth and rush Razors (I pick up Razors to contribute to neutral monster clears like baron/Dragon or for farming minions/small camps if I happen to be doing that.  Mostly, it's a cheap item with armor that can be sold later that can help push lanes).  You can decide between Ninja Tabi and Merc Treads based on their team composition.  Your first major rush items are (based on what you're playing against) Phage -&gt; Mallet, Merc Treads/Tabi, Null Magic (for Wit's End), Razors.  This gives you the ability to select up to two cloth armors, up to two null magics, and a Ruby Crystal for early game tankiness.  Now, people might be wondering where the damage is on this build and what skills I max.  I always max W first to compensate for my lower damage basic attacks (and to make my damage hybrid so they can't build resistance against one aspect of my build to shut me down, rushing BotRK or Wit's End based on their damage type and resistances), and if they rush health, my W does % health on its proc.  The final build isn't so much about its own power as its versatility and ability to pick around what's needed while still ending with a nice, finished product.  It deals % health, both magical and physical, has both magical and physical on-hits, you slow with every auto-attack, you have a skill that slows and an active slow/execute, everyone underestimates you because I don't think that Voyboy has ever played this build, and at the end of the day, you are a mild counterpick to almost everybody from building pure tank while still doing decent damage at a range.

I have a friend who plays a lot of jungle and he has been raving about this item, and we looked at the maths about how it would be on MF.

**Here are the item's stats:**
+50 attack damage
+14 health regen
+7 mana regen
+10% cooldown reduction
Passive	
Unique Passive - Butcher: Damage dealt to neutral monsters increased by 25%.
Unique Passive - Incinerate: Basic attacks and spells that do not inflict damage-over time deal 15-66 (based on level) bonus true damage over 3 seconds on hit.

**Builds out of:**
Spirit Stone (700g)
    Hunter's Machete (300g)
    Faerie Charm (180g)
    Rejuvenation Bead (180g)
    40g
Pickaxe (875g)
725g

**Cost Analysis(As taken from LoLWiki):**
50 attack damage = 2000g
14 health regeneration = 504g
7 mana regeneration = 420g
10% cooldown reduction = 322g
*Total Gold Value = 3246g*

I wont go into calculating *what* you get for free, but suffice to say that you get ~900g free AD, some regen, some CDR and the passives are free as well.

Now, some stats are not really useful for ADC, such as the HP/Mana regen and the Butcher passive (Although one could argue the regen in lane early could be very strong). Not to mention the Baron/Dragon pressure from Butcher scaling for an ADC exponentially into late game.

So, for 2300 gold, you're getting 50 AD, 10% CDR and the Incinerate passive. 50 AD is *worth * 2000g, but since bag space is not an issue, treat it as 1500g for the BF sword you could have instead, which brings our item down to 800g for 10% CDR the Incinerate passive.

CDR is awesome on MF, with her long ult CD and her trade power with her Q (both which proc incinerate, mind you). 10% CDR is valued at ~320g, which brings us to roughly 480g for Incinerate.

At it's worst, Incinerate is worth roughly the same as a longsword (15 DoT true damage vs 10AD, very rough estimate) and at it's best it's worth around 1500g worth of AD (again very roughly equating AD to true damage DoT). So as long as you're past level 4 by the time you get it, it's worth more than AD.

**Incinerate and MF:**
First off, none of her attacks are DoTs, even Make it Rain. That means all of her abilities proc the passive (even Impure shots, but since its at the same time as the autoattack proc it's irrelevant).

Secondly, **Resetting the timer on the passive does not force a tick of damage.** That is, the ""burn"" is 15-65 damage over 3 seconds at 1 proc per second. Resetting the timer will not cause the initial proc to be ""forced"" on (Teemo's E *does* however). 

This means that a full MF ult (assuming level 18) will do 5 ticks of 65/3 true damage (1 proc a second during the 2 second channel, with the timer resetting every .25 seconds or w/e, and then the last 3 ticks from the timer running down.  **This damage ends up being 108 true damage to everyone in your ult,** which is equivalent to 38.7 AD, if AD were true damage.

If your target has 100 armor (after reductions), it's worth 77 AD.
If your target has 150 armor (after reductions), it's worth 103 AD.

Your Q also procs the 65 (assume lvl 18 again) true damage. That is equiv to 81.5 AD after reductions on the first hit, or 71.5 AD on the second bounce.


**TL;DR Lizard Elder on MF is good**


**Edit:**
I forgot to mention that if you're fighting someone with a fully stacked BF sword and you have Lizard Elder and a Vamp, you will do slightly more than them if you both auto attack once and back off, but the longer you trade the more the BT will pull ahead. Keep that in mind. *Although* if you're MF using her W, their healing is halved so you'll be getting more lifesteal which could balance out the dmg...",,False,,t5_2smhl,1362079224.0,,,True,t3_19curw,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/19curw/spirit_of_the_elder_lizard_on_mf/,

First off the Morellonomicon

* 75 Ability Power
* 12 Mana Regeneration
* 20% Cooldown Reduction
* UNIQUE Passive: Dealing magic damage to an enemy champion below 40% health inflicts Grievous Wounds on them for 4 seconds. (Grievous wounds reduces healing and regeneration rates by 50%)

My normal build is now: Athenes &gt; Rabadons &gt; Morellonomicon &gt; Void Staff &gt; Zhonyas ofcourse with sorc boots. 

With the Morellonomicon and the Athene's Unholy Grail (standard on lux) you will have 40% CDR. This means you have a standard 24 sec cooldown on your ult, so no reliance on the blue buff. It also build out of a Kage's Lucky Pick, which is a nice added bonus. 

However if i get a blue pot + masteries, i will have 34% CDR without blue buff. Then i would replace the Morellonomicon with a Liandry's Torment. 

But now that i have seen the effect of the Liandry's Torment, i really want to fit it into my build, possibly replacing the Morellonomicon. Zhonya's is a personal preference of mine, since it gives me that extra bit of protection.

Boots 3, into Heart of Gold, Ionic spark, Wit's End, Mercs, Aegis. With maybe a wriggles thrown in (I think the clear speed of spark might make up for wriggles). Then eventually a Randuins.

I was thinking earlier today after having a few games with this build why people don't build both Ionic Spark and Wit's End if they benefit from both. They are arguably the 2 most synergistic (not a word) items in the game. Attack speed from both helps getting procs from both items so they synergise offensively, and magic resist and health scale together very well. On top of this, the total item build is extremely cheap, 2.1k for both items, and 1.9k for Aegis, and against double AP you can become very tanky very quickly, as well as having a heck of a lot of damage.

What do you think about this build? A couple of problems I see is 1. Recurve bow is a very large item to build early, there's a lot of downtime early game where you're saving for 1k gold. 2. Misses the utility of a build that includes phage. 3.

I belive this strategy was taken from a Korean pro game (can't remember team name) ~~where they pulled a similar combo with Vayne's invisible portion of her ult.~~  EDIT: KT bullets used submarine twitch as well


My idea would be to apply the same tactic to Rengar. His ult renders him invisible, and it has a built in gap closer to jump on whoever you want in the enemy backline. Shen ults rengar while he is invisible and will be able to land an easy taunt  on the unsuspecting enemy team. 

Bonus synergy: Have Orianna use her ball shield on Rengar to land an easy ult once rengar jumps on somebody.  Botlane would be something like Janna/Ez with high kiting ability since most of the team will be focusing their skills on the submarine.

The strategy is really simple and as far as I can tell pretty safe (assuming it is applied to a strong laner), basically you give every single one of your buffs away, including all the xp with it and rely entirely on consume and smite to clear jungle with the passive for mana costs.   

What this does is give the laner a ridiculous level advantage and early game power boost to completely zone out and snowball their lane. For example, you could start red, consume&gt;smite it down to really low health then just run out of the xp range and let your ad carry finish it off, this will give them an instant jump to level 2 when they get to lane along with a red buff and the Nunu will still have no problems clearing jungle. Also, get ready for some counter ganks on that lane because the enemy jungler will get greedy for the buffs.   
   
I've only tried it a few times, once giving an early double buff to a mid kha'zix, granting him level 6 and double buffs when his opponent was level 4, he then proceeded to stomp the lane and roam, performing ganks far stronger than any I could have done as a double buff Nunu. The other more notable example was with a friend playing Draven (he insisted I posted this after the hilarity of it), he went to lane with red buff and level 2 meaning the enemy laner had absolutely no chance to farm or even collect xp and I just went on to farm my jungle and apply some map pressure, in the end I was slightly underleveled for giving all my buffs away but I had a legendary Draven (and Zyra support by the end) and blood-boil to make him even more godly.   

**tl;dr: Play Nunu jungle with some friends (who should pick strong early laning/snowballing champs) and try giving away every single one of your buffs to them along with ALL the xp from the camp, watch them dominate with the buffs and ridiculous level advantages then proceed carry the team**

It also helps to run 0/9/21 masteries, taking the xp and gold boosts because you are basically a support who happens to be clearing the jungle camps.   ",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1g94js,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1g94js/my_experimental_nunu_jungle_strategy/,

I have a request for people’s opinions on these builds, and a few people to try and test them out. Long story short, I have access to the League Site and Wikis, but not the game to play. That leaves me with time to think and plot MUHAHHAHA. 

 *cough* Anyway, the builds focus around maximizing some Champions off-builds with [Runann's Hurricane](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Runaan%27s_Hurricane). 

First Up: AP-Shred Kog’Maw

This build focuses around Kog’Maw’s Bio-Arcane Barrage and its %-Health Shred. 

Full Build : 

[Sorcerer’s Shoes](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Shoes) +
[Malady](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Malady) +
[Runaan’s Hurricane](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Runaan%27s_Hurricane) +
[Void Staff](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Void_Staff) +
[Rabadon’s Deathcap](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Rabadon%27s_Deathcap) +
[Zhonya’s Hourglass](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Zhonya%27s_Hourglass). 

Stats:

* + 115% Attack Speed
*   +435.5 Ability Power (Deathcap % Added in)
* +43 Flat Magic Penetration (Total Malady Stacks + Sorcerer’s Shoes)
* +35% Magic Penetration
* +50 Armor  

What does this entail for when Kog’Maw starts unleashing?

* Bio-Arcane Barrage when maxed does 6% (+1% Per 100 AP) Health damage per. That means with no runes or masteries, this Max build does 10% per hit – Magic Resist

* Malady will do 15 (+10% Bonus AP). Again with no runes or masteries, this means 58 Magic Damage  - Magic Resist per shot.

* And his base damage 46 (+3 per level) will be at 100 at level 18. Which becomes nothing really at the end of the game when everyone has some kind of armor boost.

So per attack you get Base (100 – Armor) + Bio-Arcane (10% Base Health – Magic Resist) + Malady (58 –Magic Resist) onto 3 Targets who will have reduced Magic Resist due to Malady.

TL;DR: 
AP Kog’maw with Hurricane and Malady to be an AP shred, is it a good build?

Blue Buff gives 3 things: 20% CDR, Mana Regen, and Energy Regen. Blue buff is mainly relevant on mana users early game, because of the relatively small mana pools, and no items for CDR yet.

So as the game goes on, and mana users increase their CDR and mana pool, wouldn't it be best to transfer the blue buff over to energy users? This would allow them to use more abilities in team fights through energy regen, while the mana users have large enough mana pools to get through a fight without issue. Most energy users don't build CDR either, so the 20% CDR would be beast on them.

Obviously this would depend highly on team comp. I don't think it'd ever be better to pass blue to Zed when you have Anivia on your team.

But this is something to think about. I imagine this would work best on Zed, Akali, Kennen, and Lee Sin (Shen, the only other energy user, is a tank.

Realistically, you don't lose much. You drop at most 6.75 ad, but can reliably start with a doran's without issue (and your starting ad is still 3.25 higher than it was in season 2).

In addition, it allows you to use the lifesteal trick on double golems to get back health if need be - that, in particular is why doran's/3quints is so strong on the blue side. The sustain is actually quite ridiculous. And they are very *clearly* superior in the mid game.

Vision wards and Oracle's Elixir are the two purchasable means of stealth detection on Summoner's Rift (and Twisted Treeline).  Stealth is employed both by wards and champions with stealth abilities, rendering them invisible and untargetable.  In order to counter this, you need stealth detection - but which method is the better option?

**Vision Ward** - 125g

*Places an invisible ward that reveals the surrounding area and stealthed units in the area for 3 minutes.*

**Oracle's Elixir** - 400g

*Grants stealth detection until your champion dies.*

**Vision Wards vs. Oracle's**

Pink wards are best suited for **area superiority**.  Controlling high-value static positions are best done with a pink ward that will do nothing but watch that spot for you.  This will be near Dragon or Baron, as a countermeasure in lane, or in a high-traffic area in lane when a stealth champion is roaming.  A pink ward can be used to clear enemy wards to set up ganks or to maintain brush control - an aggressive support benefits from being invisible in the brush, while wall combos like Alistar/Vayne need vision to keep the hurt coming.

It is important to note that **you are not ""safe"" from stealth ganks just because a pink ward is in the lane**.  Putting a pink ward right next to you will only give you warning when the ganker is right on top of you, which may be too late.

Oracle's is best for **large-scale map control**.  It counters widespread or perpetual ward placement or stealth champs post-laning phase.  It allows for roamers to clear wards as they find them, and hinders a stealth champion's utility in teamfights.  Generally, only one champion needs to have an Oracle's on a team, although a particularly tricky stealth opponent may merit a second when the team is split up.

**Who Should Buy Oracle's?**

The value of having Oracle's comes down to **map coverage**, **survivability**, and **item prioritization**.  In an average game, Oracle's usually comes down to either the support or the jungler for these reasons.  Having an Oracle's is not helpful if you never leave your lane, if you run the risk of getting hard focused in teamfights and die, or if you really need your items to help you do your real job.  Champions like Janna, with her high mobility and escape mechanisms, or Nautilus, with his high defensive stats and shield, are great candidates for buying Oracles.  Fed bruisers with good survivability are also good candidates outside of laning phase, like an Irelia, Malphite, or Jarvan IV.

**Vision Ward Usage**

* Dragon early-mid game and baron mid-late game to get vision of the creeps AND enemy wards nearby. Shutting down their vision of drag/baron is HUGE.
* Stealth opponents in lane. An early pink shuts down champs like Akali or Twitch if they rely on their Stealth to trade.
* Stealth roamers.  A jungling Shaco or Twitch, or one that's prone to going MIA, can be soft countered by placing pink wards around entrance points to your lane (similar to how you were already placing Sight Wards, since you ARE warding your lane, right?).  Seeing them coming is  more important than seeing them once they're on you, since you'll be able to use the warning to decide to either catch them early, drop an extra pink to pick a fight when they show up, or just run back to hug your big, safe, stealth-detecting tower.
* Counter-warding enemy support. See them ward river/brush, drop a pink ward in and clean it out. 25g and map control, yay!

-Spreadsheet is all double junglers, not meta junglers.  Color-coding is END GAME damage type.
-GP5's are a must for double junglers and/or 2v1 bot lanes.

1311868035.0,26,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,j29gt,Alternate lane strategy (2/2/1),zebano,35,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/j29gt/alternate_lane_strategy_221/,"So everyone knows the common setup is 2/1/1+jungle. but since I like theory so much I wanted to consider a different setup (I'm also interested in making double jungles work). 

2/2/1 with the 1 near your blue (top for blue, bot for purple).

Basic idea: 

- the solo  + 2 mid start at blue. One of the mids will tank it and it will be given to an AP carry, giving them a much stronger early game than one normally gets when your jungler has it. 

- One mid should probably have smite.

- Your solo lane gets normal solo experience.

- Mid is responsible for having one person break off and kill 
wolves/wraiths/blue when available (may not be the one to keep blue).

-  Your dual lane near red is responsible for dual golems at 1:40 and red when available. 

- One mid is responsible for helping the AP carry top/mid get quick blue buffs when available (if it's not the carry themselves taking it). 


Advantages:

- 2 mid allows for easy roaming/counterjunging/ganking

- Early blue for AP caster allows better lane presence than when a jungler has blue.

- 2 mid may be able to zone out the enemies best early game champ.

- Mid lane can still contain someone like TF who can teleport for much of the map, but if he goes the lane is still defended. Alternatively your Annie could run teleport and the mid lane is still covered since the enemy doesn't know if she teleported top, went b or is killing wolves. 



Disadvantages:

- Having only 3 at blue makes you susceptible to gank, especially if the other team is running CV.

- Someone has to take smite and if they aren't using it constantly they're missing out on 5 gold often.

- Slower to take red buff.

- No one person in charge of timing all the buffs. 

- Potentially harder to notice when enemy is in your jungle

- people will argue about who is responsible for buying wards

- it's unconventional and some people don't like that.

- killing jungle creeps requires a certain amount of sustain which many champs don't have. Splitting the responsibilities may just make it so more champs have to be regularly.

- it's similar to low level games  (2/1/2) with multiple people taking jungle when they can and no-one wants to be a noob.

- The solo must be able to 1v2 if on purple

- less dragon control if purple.

1375225615.0,27,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1jdstx,Building the new AD Yi,tsarnicky,34,7,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1jdstx/building_the_new_ad_yi/,"I'd say mid lane yi will be most common, top lane probably has the same lack of escape, squishiness problems fiora has.

In terms of skill max order I'm guessing R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W.  Maxing Q looks like it will burn far too much mana to be viable unless you start flask&gt;tear&gt;manamune.

As for builds the options are: **bruiser** (IBGT, BT, randuins, new mr items etc), **ranged adc build** (BT, BOTRK or IE, Shiv, LW etc), **stactives** (youmuu's, mercurial, hydra, zephyr etc), anything else (triforce)?

Against traditional AP mids getting a couple actives let's you put out surprising amounts of burst, and then ideally you could roam and carry over your advantage after abusing Q waveclear.  On the other hand a traditional ranged adc build probably scales better into late game.  I'm not a fan of the bruiser style because yi lacks any CC.

A few random observation: his ulti synergizes beautifully with shiv and his Q now counts as movement for shiv (According to wiki), SoTD active gives 100% crit chance to his Q in addition to his next few autos.

As for the question of assassin-reset style vs dps?  From a theorycrafting stand point dps looks much stronger.  Let's imagine the ideal reset style yi fight: a mid game dragon fight, you get 4 last hits with your Q.  With your BT you just dealt around 800 damage total.  That's the same as around 3 seconds of auto+Q dps. 

[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1idptp/master_yis_pbe_state_impressions_after_27_games/) to a relevant analysis of the new PBE AD yi on /r/lol 

**UPDATE: COMPARISON OF MOST YI STARTING ITEMS BELOW** I've calculated master yi's dps at level 12 over 5 seconds with different starts, Assuming 80 armor. 70 mr target who has 1.8k max hp and 1k average health over those 5 seconds (relevant for BoTRK calculation).    To compensate for the gold differences between each starting core item I assumed yi spends the extra gold on boots 2 and doran's (i.e. for triforce I calculated the dps of yi with only triforce+boots1 but for youmuu's I assumed yi has youmuu's, dblade and boots2 because it costs so much less). These dps calculations are rough estimates as I actually forgot to factor in armor for his Q damage and I've estimated the enemy targets stats as well as other factors, but seeing as I made that same mistake on each dps calculation my math should give us a relevant comparison.

DPS COMPARISON: 1. BOTRK at 390 dps 2. BT at 341 3 dps. Youmuu's at 333 dps (this falls off after 6 seconds though) 4. Triforce at 327 dps 5. Shiv at 320 dps

OTHER FACTORS:  Starting youmuu's is out of the questions because it's dps is only comparable while the actives is up (although it does grant 70 more MS than the other starts while active, I don't think that matters though as 510 or 580 MS are both enough to chase down anyone).  Starting shiv is also out of the question as it's dps is somewhat lower without granting any other interesting passives/actives as the other options do (I took the shiv passive into account when calculating dps).  BT is outclassed by BoTRK, so it's out.  That leaves us with BoTRK and Triforce.

CONCLUSION: BoTRK and Triforce are the two starts I'd suggest considering when playing ad yi.  To decide between them I'd consider such factors as: Do I want crit chance? Do I need health or lifesteal?  Are they stacking HP?  Do I need bonus mana for Q?  Am I focusing on Q+resets (in which case go triforce)? How valuable will the BoTRK speed/slow active be?

**Thresh Skarner Combo**

This combo would basically be Skarner rushing in and grabbing *anyone*. Thresh would throw his lantern from a distance behind and Skarner would grab it while the suppressed target follows. This allows for the team to be able to nuke down whoever got grabbed before anyone can react, forcing the enemy team to build QSS. 

This combo can be further enhanced by having an Anivia on the same team to wall off the enemy so that they have 0 counterplay. If the target somehow survives the nuke , Thresh's flay and hook will be able to cc the target for at least another 2 seconds which should be enough time for his team to finish him off. 

This would make Skarner be viable in competitive play again as it doesn't matter who he grabs as he has no specific target in mind. The team would then be able to 4v5 push. 

**Shyvana Build** 

Hecarim has been a popular pick recently due to his insane aoe damage combined with Spirit of the Lizard Elder. But why hasn't anyone thought of that item on Shyvana? Burnout + Lizard Elder should be able to deal a crazy amount of magic + true damage. 

This gets even better in Shyvana's dragon form as her Q is aoe , her W has a trail that it leaves behind , her E is a huge aoe armor shred (which is good in the current meta - see : Jarvan , Xinzhao , Renekton ) and her ult itself is able to spread the true damage across the entire enemy team while cc-ing them at the same time. 

This could be her only damage item and she could build tanky after getting Lizard Elder just like Hecarim and deal tons of damage while being extremely tanky at the same time due to her ult. If more damage is needed a Blade of the Ruined King can be thrown in to help with sticking and dealing massive damage as well.

* When running a 3 or 4 AD teamcomp why is almost nobody finishing a Black Cleaver and many instead choosing to sell their Brutalizer late game for something else?

Given that most champs start with ~30 of each (given standard runes/masteries), and even the squishiest of champs end up at ~80 without building for it, how is this at all useful?  It seems like at its very best it would give you maybe 1% additional reduction, for it to be so far down in the defense tree, it just seems like a complete and utter waste.

1345195608.0,25,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,ydbgo,[Meta] Dominion,SenSidethink,35,10,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/ydbgo/meta_dominion/,"### Dominion - How to and why.
## Introduction
I pretty much write this because i'm tired of people joining my dominion games with stuff like ""Omg a talon on dominion"", ""we need to take the buff, thats the meta"" or ""dominion has no meta, its just 5vs5 pvp"" and then end up feeding with double the amount of deaths then kills (if not even more) and the words ""*I own at classic, you know?*"".

## The Roles
Dominion got a meta just like SR but it's new and people still have to learn how to play on it i guess. The first thing would be that just like on SR there are different roles char's can fit in. Note that one char can easily fit more then one role.

- Pusher / Stopper

&gt; The pusher goes top at the start of a round and makes the 3-4 enemys that rush the windmil drop the tower by hitting them once when they try to cap. Char's that can do this greatly are chars that have access to aoe spells with a bit range on them or skills that hit multiply targets. You basically make them unable to cap without atacking/killing your team.

- Defender

&gt; The defender goes bot at the start and it's role is to defend the bot tower (that gets a buff from time to time) while not pushing too hard. If you outpush the botlane you will neutralize the enemy tower and stop the creeps from spawning = you loose money. Only outpush the lane if you know that you can definitly cap the enemy tower, in that case cap it but dont try to defende vs 3 people solo or stuff like this. If they come with 2-3 people to get that tower back drop it, use the gold you just got for capping/laning and go back defending your bot lane. If you would die they probally cap both towers on the botlane and you will have a hard time capturing it back while they got gold from killing you. Chars that fit this role extremly good are heimer, zyra, yorick and other people with a strong laning phase.

- Taker / Backdoor

&gt; This role works well mid/lategame but only rarely on early. It's mostly filled by a character with extremly high movement ability or skills that reposition them like TF, Kayle, Teemo, Eve (because of her stealth) and other. You can either try to pick their mid tower after they went to the windmil if you have 1-2 tanky guys going top, this will make you drop their mid by over 30-40% and they will be forced to go back to the mid tower with atleast one person to stop you from capping leaving top to your team. This doesnt work if the enemy team got a tacker too, most of the time. Mid/lategame you will always try to get behind them when they go for your windmil and steal their mid during smaller fights between your teams. Nothing is more fun then a enemy trying to escape in a tower that isnt even his own one anymore.


&gt; ""A four man backdoor on the enemy mid when you can't take the Windmill is far more reliable - send a single champion on the point while the rest of the team waits in the jungle. At best, the enemy sends a couple of champions to defend mid, they get crushed 2 vs 4, and then you take the Windmill back from the last 2 defenders. At worst, it's a straight 4 vs 4 fight in the jungle instead of a 4 vs 4 + turret."" [(added via ZeMar)] (http://www.reddit.com/user/ZeMar)

- Supporter

&gt; People will say this ones are useless, most good player say something far away from that. It's true, not all supporter ar that good on dominion but chars like soraka work extremly well. You basically do the same stuff you do on SR and just support your team, but you can do other fancy stuff here too. Supporter like Soraka can also work as a defender going offtanky with some ap on the botlane. You can harass with your E, keep the lane with your Q, heal yourself or a ally when ganking with W and also support teamfights (up to 4 supports per ulti) with your ulti at the windmil while you keep bot save. Also you farm extremly well on the bot lane (lasthitting most minions will get you atleast 70-80% of the money a ""good"" enemy with some kills already got).

- ~~People who feed~~

&gt; You.. know them. That fancy full AP runepage lee without any armor, mr or hp. Or that nice AD/crit annie blaming her team for sucking.

## Stuff you should NOT do or think
1. Never drop the defense of a tower to get a buff if enemys are alive.
2. If you have to defend a tower because enemys are comming always wait at the tower. In early/mid game it does heavy dmg and doesnt stop atacking when you always hit your enemys to stop capping. Never think a bush is better then your lovely tower.
3. If you kill the enemy on the bot lane, dont rush the top lane and try to rescue anything if you would end up in a 1vs2 or 1vs3. It will make you either waste time or die.. and both points will leave your bot lane open for them.
4. Use your exact build from SR because you think it works well. Dominion is faster, more gold, extra buff (look at your passives) and you have to always build against the enemy team. If they have 3 caster with heavy dmg there isnt any use for rushing a thronmail because there is a xin or jax around. Always counter-gear.
5. Points = Skill. Not at all. You can ks all the time or run around capping towers and be useless and be ontop of the list yet you suck. The only thing that counts is that you dont feed and the points you see on the top end of the screen, k?
6. Get the buff in the mid when playing shaco/twitch/eve and any other champs. The passive hitting enemys around you will remove the ""omg where is he"" effect and make you a firework.

## Stuff you should do, lots of it.
1. Leave the buff in the mid to the carry. A tank wont need the shield/extra dmg and probally just steal kills with the passive from carry's who need them to keep outdamage the enemy team. A carry gets all he needs from it, a shield, more damage, you love it. Only get this in rare situations else.
2. Abuse the healspots on your lanes. You can either drop shrooms or traps on them or keep the enemy from using it while you always heal yourself back after harrasing. (Note: It heals hp AND sp)
3. Use your minions. If they defend top 2vs2 for example push minions into their tower to neutralize it. This leaves you in a 2vs2 not a 2vs2+tower.
4. Abuse the laser. Chars like skarner, lee (rarely singed and volibear) and chars with a jump can abuse the laser to kill enemys that follow you up or get thrown in. This rarely happens but it's always a good laugh (also some bugs with noc and maokai can make him follow noc in his ulti flying in a enemy resulting in both dieng. Biggest fail you could end up with.).
5. Use a speedbuff whenever you run through the jungle. It can make you chase faster and escape the same way.

## Differences between SR and Domi (Playstyle ones)
1. You get passive gold, higher mana/hp regen, percent armor/magic penetration and other stuff (Your passive buff)
2. GP10 items. Please just dont ever take them. The gold you get in the 15-20min a round lasts isnt worth it at all. (GP10 and RoA work at the same speed they do on SR)
3. No jungle.
4. Some items are different and some new items are there. Entropie for example.
5. Dominion gives 56 gold per 10 seconds while SR gives 13 gold per 10 seconds.

## Summoner Spells

- Flash: ★★☆
- Exhaust: ★★★
- Ghost: ★★☆
- Heal: ★★☆
- Clarity: ★☆☆
- Ignite: ★★☆
- Garisson: ★★☆
- Promote: ★★☆
- Cleanse: ★★☆
- Surge: ★☆☆
- Revive: ★★★

&gt; Everybody always wants to ask me why Revive is so important in high Elo. For a bot laner, the reason is simple: you can get right back to your capture point before the enemy can neutralize it, even if you died to a gank.
For a top laner, Revive is more of a list of reasons:

- Very strong in the windmill fight.
- Stronger than Ghost.
- Allows you to distract enemies in a lost team fight by running away from your team.
- Allows you to recover from a bad mistake such as getting bushwhacked.
- No other summoner spell is going to let you get out of ganks anyways, especially vs the meta picks.
- Allows you to maintain a winning game in the face of adjusted respawn timers (in favor of the enemy team).

Overall, the pros of Revive vastly outweigh its single con: long cooldown. Specced Revive is absolutely necessary to have, so be prepared to allocate something to the defensive tree.

### The End
I just hope people read this and stop going with 5 people for one tower the complete game leaving bot lane alone or feeding. Dominion is a valid game mode just like SR and people enjoy it. Stuff like ""I only play SR; proper LoL you know?"" just makes you sound like you suck at dominion. If you do mistakes at the first rounds on dominion nobody is going to blame you, but we will buttape you if you end up blaming us for it while you act like phreak jungling on dominion, jesus.

1344264812.0,25,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,xrmxn,Counter to the Graves/Taric armor nightmare.,Yondee,29,4,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/xrmxn/counter_to_the_gravestaric_armor_nightmare/,"When I AD bot, I absolutely hate playing against Graves/Taric. Unless they are quite stupid, the Graves will always have significantly more armor than you for an engage. Trades are extremely tough to win vs that combo.

So I propose a *theorized* counter. I haven't had much free time, and right now I am at work so **I have not tried this, it is merely a thought experiment.** I would love to hear opinions on this though.

The premise of this counter is throwing Veigar bot lane, preferably with Soraka. You need an AD carry that can go against a mid, but there are many that can do just fine vs the majority of mids, it is just common meta to put them bottom with the increased sustain for farm. Ez and Sivir excel at this, while the unconventional Kayle ADC works extremely well too.

The thought process behind the swap:  
Veigar is an AP that thrives off single target last hits. He needs it to boost his AP and become the scary little guy everyone has seen at one point or another. Although Veigar can do fine mid last hitting (in terms of mana regen) you usually have to trade off between aiming for CS or harass. Having a Soraka would give you enough mana to do both  effectively. Thus, having Veiger/Soraka in ""the farm lane"" is unconventional, but not actually a bad option.  
The real reason I am mentioning it is because it negates the strongest part of this common bottom lane. Veigar will be doing magic damage to harass, which negates Taric and Graves' natural 'tankiness'. You have a great engage/disengage with the Veigar stun. You also have the Soraka heal which will give armor for trades, while they have no damage reducing assets. Bonus, If Soraka can get a Starfall or two off you are probably doing near true damage as Veigar, which is a scary thing indeed.

I will list the pros and cons that I can think of.

Pros:  

* Safely farming Veigar.  
* Good engage/disengage for trades.  
* Stat advantage for trades.  
* Negate the strengths of your lane opponents.

Cons:  

* Very situational.  
* Non roaming middle lane.  
* Less safe ADC farm (Debatable ^1)  

 ^1 : I think many ADCs are perfectly viable in mid, but it is true that it would be a less safe farm lane than having a support. 

I would love to hear your opinions on this subject. I plan on trying it out at some point in the future. The main problem being it is so situational it could be a long time before I can seize my opportunity. Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance for your criticism and suggestions.

I see her rarely as a kill lane, and almost never in mid.

I find that when I play lux, I almost always dominate the game (~1600 ELO).

Lux has a very safe laning phase with her range, and almost free lane harass with her AoE slow. Her passive allows for free damage when timed correctly. At level 6, if the champ isn't at full health, a landed snare/slow/ult/ignite is almost a guaranteed kill.

Her roaming potential is so-so, but if you're able to hit snares her ganks are golden.

In the mid/late game, her teamfight damage is RIDICULOUS. I see a lot of Lux try to use their ult to last hit people. I try to line up as many of people as I can, then Ult/slow snare into their mass. This combo takes a quarter to a half of the entire teams health depending on my AP. The shield also has the potential to double proc on your entire team.

What she lacks in CC like many APs, she makes up in AoE damage, and in the fact that her range makes her incredibly safe in fights.

Why isn't she seen more?

I'm the top lane player in my team, and I love to play on top, because I feel like this is the most dynamic lane. However, I'm currently looking for some currently unorthodox, but totally viable picks.

Karma

I bought Karma in the last week, because I was very curious after reading Caitlyn's guide on SoloMid. Well, she works very well vs. certain matchups, as she can duel well vs. almost anyone, but I feel like her damage is lacks in the early-midgame, and she's way too vulnerable for ganks and high mobility ( riven top + jungle ali wtfff ).
However, she's very good vs. Vlad, and almost anyone else without super high mobility and sustain, atleast early on. ( think about jax, gp for example )
Lategame, she's a total beast with her 700HP shields and suprise bursts, but she's much more a support than an actual carry. I feel that she can work very well in teams where's the support is someone like Leona, Nautilus or Blitz, and she has the potential to carry and to support in the same time.

Bruiser Fizz

Super strong early game, high sustained damage. Can shutdown sustain champs like WW and Vlad, and can duel very well. Almost ungankable, and acts like a super anti carry in lategame, because he can still dish out tons of damage even without his burst combo. Strong laning, strong lategame, can be build multiple ways - I recently picked him up and I feel like he's more viable as bruiser than most people thinks. ( Well, in soloQ he's better as an assasin, because of his potential to snowball hard )

AD Carry Kayle

I see more Kayles on top after Rincent's guide on SoloMid. She's really a very strong pick, and can deny almost anyone without high mobility. Still, I feel like she's waaaay too squishy and very, very vulnerable to ganks ( that little movement speed boost won't gonna help you ), and she ends up pushing her lane most of the time.

AP Soraka

The total Vlad counter. She's viable vs. some caster tops, but hard cc and fast burst ( like talons, fizz's ) can just destroy her. Lategame, she's like Karma, but I feel like she's less useful. AP Soraka is better as mid.

Graves

Now he's the one I curious about. I love playing AD Carries, and I feel like Graves can be a very good toplaner because of his innate tankiness, high sustained and burst damage, a nice gapcloser and the smokescreen. He can splitpush very well, and end up having a very, very strong lategame, as he can build himself like as an AD carry ( Okay, maybe add a Wriggles or a Mercury early on ).
This is just theorycrafting, since I don't own Graves.

Sejuani

I don't own her, but I like her kit. I know she's stronger as a jungler because of her ganks, but I think she can be good as a tanky AP aswell. Add a Shurelia, a Rylai ( yo boar i herd you like slows so i put a slow in your slow so you can slow while you slow ), a RoA maybe, a FoN, FH, and you have a nice initator and tank, who can still deal alot of damage. Yet I think her early game would be just pure shit because of her lack of sustain and innate tankiness.

1376687717.0,28,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1kigqs,Graves - Blade of the Ruined King vs Bloodthirster - Maths included,Sicariidae,35,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1kigqs/graves_blade_of_the_ruined_king_vs_bloodthirster/,"For a long time, people have been going Bloodthirster first on Graves and for good reason, he has really good AD ratios and it gives him significant burst potential.

However, recently people have been buying Blade of the Ruined King on champions like Varus, Vayne, Tristana and Twitch to add to their burst early-game.

Blade of the Ruined King seems like a good item for Graves; the extra attack speed allows him to refresh the cooldown of Quickdraw faster, the slow of the item lets him abuse his passive and come ahead in duels, the active adds to his already potent burst combo and finally, late-game where he tends to fall-off slightly isn't such a problem with the passive of Blade.

So, I thought I'd run the numbers on it to see if he is significantly hurting his burst damage by going Blade of the Ruined King instead of Bloodthirster.

Assuming that Graves and his target (I chose Kog'Maw) are both level 9, with standard runes (AD Reds, Armor Yellows, Lifesteal Quints) and standard masteries (I chose 21-9-0). Assuming Doran's Blade start on both champions, rushing either Bloodthirster or Blade depending on the test. Assuming Buckshot hits point-blank for maximum damage. All damage is post-resistance/penetration calculations.

**Stacked Bloodthirster**

* Buckshot Damage: 336.89
* Ultimate Damage: 412.39
* Total Damage: 749.28

**Blade of the Ruined King**

* Buckshot Damage: 269.99
* Ultimate Damage: 343.52
* Blade Active Damage: 133.80
* Total Damage: 747.31

As you can see, the difference in damage is minimal. Despite Buckshot doing 24.78% more damage and Collateral Damage doing 20.05% more damage, for single-target burst, the overall damage difference is only 0.26%.

Two things to note: this assumed the Bloodthirster was fully-stacked.   It seems slightly unrealistic that a Graves was able to fully-stack a Bloodthirster by level 9, but it was mainly to show that, despite the huge amount of AD given by Bloodthirster, the difference was minimal. Secondly, this is only single-target burst; Blade of the Ruined King will impact Graves' AoE contribution to teamfights, however, with the self-peel of the active, passive damage and additional attack speed, he contributes more auto-attack damage than normal.

I had planned to add more regarding the damage auto-attacks do early-game, the actual numbers on how it impacts his teamfights and the late-game damage, but I lost the spreadsheet. If people are interested in reading about that, let me know and I'll start working on rebuilding the spreadsheet.

* Spiderlings now group closer together while moving

&gt;**Volatile Spiderling**
&gt;
* Movement Speed has been reduced
&gt;
&gt;**Rappel**
&gt;
* Elise can no longer descend outside of the indicated area Fixed a bug where Elise could begin casting spells and attacking as soon as she began her descent while she was still untargetable 
* Spiderlings will now descend from Rappel slightly after Elise instead of descending at the same time

The Rappel range fix I suppose is fair. The spiderlings reppeling slower is a little bit of an annoyance, as you can’t use it to de-aggro towers, but again, not really game breaking.

I am not sure about the logic behind reducing the Volatile Spiderling? I never thought ‘OMG that thing is too fast’, but this will mean it will be easier to run far enough for it to time out and explode without dealing damage. I guess it all depends on how much slower it is

Now the spiderlings have:

* Effective physical health 110-383 from 153-676
* Effective magic health 120-396 from 166-733
(Before the multi-target reduction)

Including the changes to the multi-target, the spiders, they should be about as hardly as they used to be up until level 6, from 11+ they will considerably squisher. Especially when you consider most champions will have some form of armour/magic pen, so their effective health will be reduced further.

I know Elise doesn’t depend on her spiderlings, but what does everyone think, is Elise still a strong pick?

While Jatt did mention that the active effect can break the self lockout of his ""W"" he didn't touch on another reason why it is a strong pick versus Elise.  
  
When she transforms into Spider form she spawns spiderlings as I am sure you are aware. Hydra means you not only clear them faster but also heal for more on every auto against her.   
  
So overall, If you are having a difficult time against Elise than MR might not be the most effective answer. Building a Ravenous Hydra and abusing the sustain from minion waves along with the increased trading potential versus her spider form may be the way to go.

Faerie Charm (180 gold): 

= 3 mana / 5 sec 

= .6 mana / sec

= 36 mana / min

= 216 mana / 6 min


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rejuvenation Bead (180 gold):

= 5 hp / 5 sec

= 1 hp / sec

= 60 hp / min

= 360 hp / 6 min


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At 35 gold/each, it takes about 2 potions to give as much mana from charm or health from bead in ~6 minutes. This yields you 110 more gold if you get 2 hp/mana pots instead of a bead/charm. Gives you the option of 1 ward + 1 pot, or 3 pots (+450 health or +300 mana).

However, a charm/bead gives an earlier Philosopher Stone, which should also be considered.

Say you get Philo at minute 8 (bead start) vs minute 12.

Philosopher Stone (700 gold):

= 7 hp / 5 sec

= 1.4 hp / sec

= 84 hp / min

= 504 hp / 6 min
= 9 mana / 5 sec

= 1.8 mana / sec

= 108 mana / min

= 648 mana / 6 min
= 5 gold / 10 sec

= .5 gold / sec

= 30 gold / min 

= 180 gold / 6 min
For the 700 gold you paid for Philo, these are the stats you got:

864 health = 360 [bead] + 504 [philo]

648 mana

180 gold

It takes approximately 13 (6 health + 7 mana) potions to give these stats, costing 455 gold. Subtracting the gold Philo gives in 6 minutes from its cost equals 520 gold.

The burst from philostone also is heavier the second back, whereas the potions are stronger in the initial part of laning phase.

My conclusion is that I will probably stop rushing (and maybe even running) Philo, and I definitely will stop running Faerie Charm starts. It's not worth it unless you get it early, and even so, it takes 23.5 minutes for Philo to just pay for itself.

From that point just build straight AP or whatever you want. Even if you dont get fed, u still got a 1.75 sec AOE stun every so often which is very underrated.

We all know he was hit very hard due to not only some nerfs but meta changes as well, but I still think he's a strong pick overall.

The thing to understand about Corki is that like Ez, he doesn't play like other ADC's. None of his abilities scale very well with AD, and since they removed the crit from his passive he doesn't synergize with crit/AS either. 

I stopped playing Corki altogether until I saw a new build, which I first saw on Turtle's stream, and I want to ask for LoLMeta's opinion on it. 

For runes I run AD reds, Armor yellows, MR blues, and Lifesteal quints. The lifesteal from my quints allows me to open with a dorans to help with early aggression. I run 21-0-9 masteries, putting points into Meditation to spam my Q more in lane.

Then I build SotEL&gt;Triforce (Sheen&gt;Zeal&gt;Phage)&gt;LW/BotRK (I will get both, but choose what to build first depending on the game)&gt;Defensive item/IE.

The burn from the SotEL procs with each tick from the gatling gun, making your early all ins very strong. The CDR also means you can spam your missiles more, and TriForce makes for a strong midgame, although you do fall off late if you haven't snowballed the game.

I think blue Ez has shown us that not all ADC's are the same, and building to compliment a carries strengths is important. I found a BT build to be very dissapointing in terms of damage with Corki, and if you're going to be building IE you might as well play Cait.

[I was looking at the AA range of champions](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Range) for crafting an unconventional (non-meta) *ADC* playstyle &amp; I came across one champion in particular that had an unusually long AA range compared to others in her class: **Annie**. *Hear me out...*

&gt;[Annie's toolkit](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Annie)


Here are some possible benefits to give Annie an edge in a duo bot lane:

* Annie has **625** AA range. That's the **second highest** normal range in the game, next to Caitlyn. 

* Annie's passive coupled with a 4 second CD on her Q means she can stun often &amp; potentially win trades this way

* Annie's Q makes her **incredibly** mana efficient

* Her E would be leveled up with priority, making her *incredibly tanky* during exchanges

**Cons**

* None of her abilities scale with AD

* Squishy without her E being up

* No escape without her stun up



Essentially, I see her strongest build as an ADC focusing on *attack speed* and control, with your team building to make up for the lack of a conventional ADC's damage output. **Here is a suggested 6-item build:**

* Wit's End / Malady
* Trinity Force
* Iceborn Gauntlet
* Bloodthirster
* T2 boots of your choice 
* **Warmog's Armor** or **Zhonya's** since she does scale with AP. You just don't want to get caught out and die quickly


This isn't fully baked by any means, which is why I'm posting here in the /r/LeagueofLegendsMeta ...someone poke holes in my theorycraft please! Cheers guys!

I decided I need a specific strategy to my solo queue choices, so I employed the ""Filler role"" where I would fill whatever spots we would need so hopefully no one is playing a role they didnt know. This worked, I felt I was alright at every position (I will never think I am good) and I climbed up to 915 ELO before the league system went in.

Now I am having problems with Ranked, borderlining on frustration. Which probably could be explained in my last game. I went Teemo (probably the champ I am best with) top and was facing an Sejuani (never seen her in lane), which went great because she really had no poke on me. I won my lane going 7/2 in the process, ganking mid everytime my lane pushed out. The problem deals with in that same time the rest of my team went 3-25, and those 3 kills were all the mid Karthus who was 3/1.

No matter what I do in my lane/teamfights, I can't help the Ezreal who goes off in the jungle alone and then uses his E to poke the enemy team when they find him. I can't help the players who think we should take their first top tower while the enemy pushes bot inhib down.

Elise - I think she is who Riot had in mind for this item, as it is in her recommended list.  I never thought her to be much of a split pusher though, it seems like the popular build was magic pen and CDR, so she wouldn't be particularly good at taking down towers, unless her spiderlings really make up that much.

Teemo - I could definitely see this item working well on Teemo in the top lane.  Against someone like Lee or Riven, the armor and HP regen are great, and having some AP isn't all that bad since you will need to use shrooms to stay safe.  I think adding Runaan's hurricane would make him a split push monster.

Yi - Not really sure on this one.  I would think that a split pushing Yi would want to focus on AD more than AP, but if you were going for AP mop Yi anyways, this could work well.

Nidalee - I see the same problem with her as I do with Yi.

Heimerdinger - Heimer seems like a perfect candidate for this item, allowing him to just turtle and never lose his first tower.  I could see him getting caught far too often when his lane inevitably pushes however.  Perhaps with the rework coming soon^TM he will have a more reliable way to get out of a bad situation.

I could even think in the right comp and situation, Singed or Shen could put it to good use.  They both can use AP, even if it isn't normally bought in loads, and they both really enjoy split pushing.

Build I've tried and really liked is Sorcerer's Shoes, Seraph's Embrace, Muramana, Iceborn Gauntlet, Banshee's Veil and Mikael's Crucible

Ofc build order depends on needs, but an early tear is obvious, and it would probably be optimal to get both Archangel's Staff and Manamune before hitting 750 mana stacks, because if you have a Tear and Archangel's/Manamune and hit max, they will upgrade, but the tear stacks reset. Not sure if this happens if you have both upgraded tears. It would make sense if they both upgrade to Muramana and Seraph's at the same time.

This build gives you about 4.5k mana, insane mana regen, 150~ armor and magic resist as well as plenty of health.

But you get more than simply the stats: 

* Banshee's spellshield 

* The manashield from Seraph's (25% of current mana) 

* Insane mana scaling on AA's and your spells (+6% of current mana on-hit and single target spells) 

* The Crucible active (cleanse + heal on self/ally)

* Iceborn Gauntlet proc. (125% of base dmg in AoE and an 35% AoE slow on AA's after spellcast.)

____

This build not only provides insane single target sustained damage, but also gives you epic survivability with Seraph's Manashield + Banshee's spellshield, very valuable utility and self-peel with slow from Gauntlet as well as the Crucible active to save either yourself or your AD carry from lategame CC. 

Another viable option might be the Ohmwrecker (disables turrets), to replace Iceborn Gauntlet, but that might be more situational. 

Also, this build burns through mana like crazy (and % based!), so even though you have 4,5k mana, Clarity migh be really good to have too, after the change. (Now restores 40% of max mana, 50% with mastery)

**Skills synergize and build**
Their Skillset synergize really well. They both have shields, they both have slows. And Jannas knock-up is works really well for allowing to trade, and hit the enemies with Oriannas' ball. 

With this set-up, I build Orianna as a AP/attack speed hybrid. Since her Passive scale off of AP, and the faster she attacks more damage. Theorycrafting at high level. I tend to build somthing similar to this: Boots+3pots -&gt; a couple of dorans -&gt;Sheen -&gt; Malady - PD - Lich Bane - Last items is situational, but often I go for Rabadons Deathcap.

**Laningphase**

In Lane we both Max our shields, then I just try to force trades all the time. With the shields you will be taking lesser and lesser damage as the time goes. When we hit lvl 6 Orianna and Janna have an amazing wombo-combo. Janna w+q into Orianna ulti into Janna ulti.


**lategame**

Late game, after getting your build done, you get a 318 AP. This allows you to be a semi-ap carry while still doing loads of damage with your AA's. 180 AD with an immense attack-speed, and a lichbane proc with 318 damage, wich you should get almost all the time. And if your Janna shields you, as she should most of the time you get an extra 50 AD)

 Also what really makes her the strongest is her utility. She got the same ultimate, shield and slows of a normal AP carry Orianna. And if you have a shen/Irelia/Lee Sin/etc on your team he can iniate with your shield, then you pull your ulti off and procede to melt the team down.

**Set-ups**

I've been trying this with 5-man premades as I dont want to play this with randoms. The Janna must be a duo, and preferably the rest of the team aswell. The team I had the best experience with was Morgana mid, Lee Sin jungle and Kennen top. This makes quite a good synergize all over the team. You got 4 shields, an insane ultimate combo and great iniate.

Here's what I've found. Feel free to call my bullshit or enter your own thoughts.. Again. 

The best champs I've found in regards to late game are as follows. (In no particular order)

Mid: Kennen, Morgana, Veigar, Karthus, Anivia. 

Top: Jax, Olaf, Malphite, Poppy, AD Sion, Nasus, Shen, Singed, Kayle. 

Jungle: Dr.Mundo, Warwick, Nautilus, Amumu, Malphite, Nocturne, Hecarim. 

AD Carry: Tristana, Kog'Maw, Graves, Ashe, Vayne. 

Support: Janna, Blitzcrank, Soraka.

**Explantions**


Mid: AoE clearing power, CC, scaling, and ultimates were the main factors. Most OP champs in the game I think are Morgana, Karthus, and Kennen due to their ability to deal very large portions of damage to an entire enemy team while not dying (or dying on purpose in Karth's case). Veigar is great for his late nuking ability, but a good assassin will ruin his day much easier than a Kennen or Morgana. Also Anivia. A good wall can win a team fight easily, just look at Froggen for examples. 

Top: Damage, Tankiness, Crowd Control, and pushing power are the main factors here. Best champs IMO are actually Singed, Malphite and Poppy. All three can single handedly win a game during the transition from mid to late during team fights. Once Singed gets strong enough, he can push lanes with impunity and then run to initiate with his team very quickly while being extremely tanky and slowing/damaging the enemy team in fights. Poppy simply has an extremely good couple passives and a game breaking ult that let her 1v4 in some situations and still come out on top with a couple of kills. Only problem I've found with Poppy is her mana-hungry nature. Malphite just holds back enemy AD champs very hard. He debuffs attack speed so well while being so tanky that he can control a team fight exceptionally. Not to mention his initiation power with his ultimate. 

Jungle: Similar to top for stats I looked at. Nautilus is crazy good here with his awesome kit of CC techniques that also let him tank efficiently and deal AoE damage at the same time. Amumu is also good for the same reasons. 

AD Carry: Tristana my favorite here, her steroids/damage/escape/range make her perfect for late game dominance. Graves is one of the best ADC duelers due to his smoke grenade and his attack speed steroid/dash, and Kog Maw simply has an extremely good amount of damage. Ashe is good for her arrow and slows, but doesn't have a very good steroid or a reliable escape. Corki has good damage, and can kite people well, but lacks the range and steroids of Tristana or Kog. ~~I was going to put Vayne here, but to be honest I think if she ever gets hit with some sort of hard CC she is instantly nuked down due to how squishy and short ranged she is.~~  Vayne has way too much damage for me to ignore with all her great steroids. Also, tumble crits. She is better than Corki as far as I am now concerned (after a closer look at her damage). 

Support: Janna is queen of the supports, that much I still believe. Her kit is way too strong to ignore, and a well played one can single handedly win the game by keeping her entire team safe with her ultimate. Blitzcrank is really polarizing, he can be awful the entire game, then land one good pull over a wall or at a Baron fight and the game will instantly be won. Soraka has a boring kit and mediocre peel, but her heals (despite being nerfed) have a global presence and can turn a team fight completely around for her team when used right. 

Anyway there are my thoughts. Sorry for my last post being so shallow, hope this one is better. :)

**PLEASE READ MY RESPONSES TO OTHERS COMMENTS BEFORE COMMENTING ON MY ANALYSIS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE!**

**INTRO**

The recent update to the lolking.net site rekindled my interest in using it's item win-rate charts to objectively compare the success rates of items.

However I came across a few issues in comparing items using lolking.net's item pages' win statistics:

* differences in price
* differences in which build order slot/role the item fills (ie: BT generally comes after IE)
* differences in role of champion (ie: a well used IE probably has a greater influence than a well used sunfire cape)

however, I was able to make some meaningful comparisons by comparing the 'top champions' section of specific item pages against other (similar cost/champion type) items' 'top champion' page. I believe because in the below comparisons these variables are held constant the differences in win rate can be attributed to the item's relative merits (versus the compared item).


**EXPLANATION OF WHAT I DID**

The most enlightening/unexpected comparisons I found were those between sunfire cape &amp; randuin's omen (both hp/armor: good vs strong ad carry, and somewhat good for aggression: definitely both 3rd/4th buys) and between wit's end &amp; wriggle's lantern (both good for some resist and some jungle clear speed).


Both pair of items shared a few of the same champions on their top champions page: I then compared these top champions win rates (with this item) and % of games in which item was bought.

I assumed that a lower % of games bought most likely signified the item was bought later into the game / with more money, and so the win rate is slightly inflated (this assumption was *NOT* necessary to draw the following conclusions).

(edit in response to 1st comment): I think the wit's end, wriggle's comparison is useful and relevant despite some champions buying both.  Because (#1grammar) most of the time the player must choose between one of the two for your 1st/2nd buy: then focus on larger buys with hp.  Moreover in most games you will face both substantial phys and magic damage so both options will be viable.


**CONCLUSION**

[*wriggles*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3154#topchampions)
v
[*wit's end*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3091#topchampions)

relevant champions: warwick, udyr, shyvana, nocturne:

* for all above champions wit's end had a higher win rate

* for most above champions had &gt;5% higher win rate and similarly higher purchase rate

**Conclusions in price context:** 

Most pros I've read commentary by (chauster mainly, other pro AMAs: dyrus etc) believe wit's end is a counter/rare buy, whereas wriggle's is often featured in guides as a standard buy.  However the high win rate's on wit's end (avg 8% higher than wriggles, only 3% lower than IE/PD) leads me to suspect (read: it is likely/an important possibility) wit's end is a good item in nearly all situations, and should be valued more highly.


[*sunfire cape*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3068#topchampions) v [*randuin's omen*](http://www.lolking.net/items/3143#topchampions)

relevant champions: malphite, nautilus, amumu, shen, dr mundo

* malphite benefits more from sunfire cape
* amumu and shen work with both
* nautilus, and mundo benefit more from randuin's omen
* sunfire cape has a few higher % average win rate:  because of high win rates with singed, warwick and skarner (=fact, do not infer my opinion from that)

**Conclusions in price context:**

Sunfire cape costs slightly less, so it's winrates should most likely tend to be lower than randuin's omen: since you must already have more money/ be ahead to buy randuin's.  However with or without minor adjustments for cost, there are clear differences between champions' winrates with each item: see above / in links.

Previously (~a month ago, before recent patches) I'd read pro's opinions saying sunfire cape was a cost-inefficient buy, mostly for the fancy fire graphics, whereas randuin's was a great item, in the majority of games. However after the recent adjustments on both items, sunfire cape is now a much more viable on certain junglers.


I hope you enjoyed my mini-article; (relevant) commentary, (constructive) criticism, and (lavish) praise are all always welcome!


**tl;dr:** wit's end is undervalued in comparison to wriggle's lantern.  On some champions sunfire cape offers higher win rates than Randuin's omen.

AP Janna is considered a 'Troll pick', I know. She is a lot of fun though and that's what this game is about, so I like to play her that way from time to time. I did it yesterday vs a Fizz and it went swimmingly! You can effectively zone him out early with W and AA, while your shield is enough to absorb his early harass. You win every trade. I was able to hold him to 30cs by the end of the game, while I ended up with ~120 (short game). He wasn't able to gank because I could knock down creep waves with Q real easily and keep him pushed to his tower once he was high enough level to roam.

I think Nautilus is one of the most dynamic characters in the game. He's right alongside Kayle as a champion that can play multiple roles while being exceptional at all of them. Aside from ranged AD, he can play every current role in the Meta. 

Top? Tanky stats, can take a beating and still dish out his own if you can land a few auto attacks every 6 or so seconds (passive procs extra damage). Cannot be pushed out of lane easily because of the aoe clearing power of the W and E, and is *extremely* easy to gank for as a jungler because his ult is only dodgeable by skills that make the champ untargetable (Flash won't save you, the ult will follow). If you can land the ult, you can easily lock down the enemy with passive proc, aa reset W, E, hook combo. Can be built to counter almost any champion top with armor/magic resist (Glacial Shroud and Wit's End respectively) and cooldown reduction (Kindlegem, Glacial Shroud). Scales well with health items and can farm easily due to passive and AOE skills. 

Mid? Not extremely good but still a strong pick in my humble opinion. Similar to top, can take a beating and still dish out his own if the enemy neglects to hug the creep wave. Landing a Q on them means they take a full combo no matter what, and any melee range mids (Sion, Fizz, Mordekaiser, Talon, Kassadin) will be eaten alive by a full combo. Can roam and gank as well as anyone with hook/ult. Offers fantastic dragon control with his CC and sheer tankiness, and can invade enemy jungler alongside his own to lock down potential buffs and enemies with his amount of CC. 

Bot? Great support. Functions much like Blitzcrank with an easier ult to utilize (not neccessarily better, but easier to land for sure). Naut's hook is also much easier to land than Blitz's and  the ult is targeted (same as top, flash will not save you. If it has been cast, you are about to be CC'd). Also, can peel as well as a Blitzcrank or Leona with his passive, E, Ult, and Q. Not as good at peeling or sustain as a Janna or Soraka respectively, but can still be considered strong with the lane control he offers. Also, can easily still be just as effective building nothing but GP5 items (Philo, Kage's, Heart of Gold) and Aegis of the Legion as if he was in the ...

Jungle. I will admit, early clear time is lackluster, and prone to counter jungling since early levels leave you exposed by yourself. But if you are careful and have a team that can help, you can easily survive it. Once you reach level 5, your W is ranked enough to allow you to take almost no damage from camps, gank well, and still survive with no need for Wriggles. As I said before: benefits greatly from GP5 items and has no need for more damage items due to how good his AOE and tank stats are. Ganks are fantastic at level 6, but still good from level 1-5 if you learn to land Q consistantly. 

Roamer. Now hear me out, if you can get a bot lane AD with some form of a good escape (Ezreal, Tristana, Corki) you can effectively roam between bot lane and mid. I have seen a couple good Alistars do this effectively, but in my experience trying it with Nautilus is even better. Simply play a standard support until level 6 or so. If your lane is stable, your carry understands what you are doing, and you have warded correctly, feel free to roam to mid and try to grab the ap carry. Landing a hook is sometimes easier than getting off Alistar's QW combo, and has a shorter cooldown and better followup with Nautilus' passive and ult! It's more of an active support role, but it still does well. 

**WARNING: PEOPLE TO WATCH OUT FOR**

Top: Irelia, Warwick, and Olaf. Irelia/Olaf true damage plus passive CC reduction/Ult CC immunity make this lane hard to win. Warwick will simply laugh in your face, aa minions and Q to heal any damage you can deal to him. 

Mid: Ahri. True damage, long range skill shots, a taunt CC, and mobility (3 dashes plus flash?!) to escape even when she is ulted make this one of the hardest matchups in the game. Pray you have a good jungler or that she is a bad Ahri player, because a good one will make you cry. 

Jungle: No one can really beat you in a one on one fight once you get to level 7, but before that many of the current favorite jungler invaders (Udyr, Shyvana, Mundo, Lee Sin) can destroy you if they catch you at a bad time. Stay wary, and try to get your team to ward jungle entrances if they can. 

Bot: No one can really outright beat you down bot lane. Bot lane is more skill based than matchup based, but if there's any lane to avoid it would be Nunu + Kog Maw. The range, damage, and constant slows can beat a player who isn't being careful. 

***TL;DR*** Nautilus can play many roles well, and his abundance of CC and the fact that he can do damage and contribute without being item and level dependant make him a very strong pick for just about any team or lane. And that is why he is my new main. ",,False,,t5_2smhl,True,,,True,t3_tkmto,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/tkmto/i_main_nautilus_now_and_ill_tell_you_why_long/,

As per the Riot ""Hecarim Patch Preview"" video, Morello talks about how when champions who get assists or kills on champions of higher levels than them, they will gain proportionately more XP, the higher the level gap. Contrawise, players who recieve assists or kills on champions of *lower * levels will receive proportionately* less *XP. I believe this will be a HUGE change to the meta, I've been thinking about it for a few days, here's a couple of thoughts I've had:

- Roaming may become viable
- Support may be much more fun to play (duh)
- Although Morello denies that ""rubber-banding"" will occur in games, but I find that hard to believe, unless the XP ratios we're talking about are much lower than expected.
- Changes to how the jungle works?
- Kill lanes less viable?
- Changes in how teamfights are fought and/or initiated?
- Longer games? Less willingness to surrender at 20?

1326840882.0,26,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,oliet,Shen - Are we playing him wrong?,FortyAPM,32,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/oliet/shen_are_we_playing_him_wrong/,"So i saw some changes mentioned on the lol forums.  It was changes that were on the PBE that dont exist anymore.  I logged into the PBE and found that those changes were removed.  I guess they didnt like the changes that they mentioned.

One of the changes was that they added armor to his w (shield).

That got me thinking, perhaps instead of leveling up his q for harras, maybe we could just level him up in this order.

W-&gt;E-&gt;Q

ofcourse always taking his ult first.

Well i played a few games.  The first match I had a support (alistar) bottom (ranked game).  I had to try long and hard to convince them to let me try this in a ranked game.  So we went up against ezreal and soraka.  A pretty good duo to test this against.  We were tanky bottom with no ranged abilities.  At first thought, you would think that there is no way this would work out good for us.  Well the opossite happened and we completely dominated bottom lane.  I didnt put a point into q until it forced me to put a point into it.  I think i was level 10 or 12 before I put a point into it.  Point bieng, with an absurdly strong w, a support to heal me, having high hp/5, armor, mr, we did not need a ranged ad to deal with their ranged ad.
http://www.leaguereplays.com/replays/match/151969/

The second match I tested this in was another ranked match, this time solo top vs renekton.  Same scenario as the top, except I got 1 point in q early on.  Did not level this skill up any further than 1 point, simply used to last hit minions and heal.  W took precedence over e, put points into ult as necessary.

Renekton couldnt do jack shit to me top lane.  Didnt need potions, just armor, hp/5, and my q to heal ever so slightly.  We had a twitch that game that was horribly behind in levels and we still managed to win this match because I was unkillable.
http://www.leaguereplays.com/replays/match/151970/

There was one more match that I played, also ranked, but dont have the replay for.  It was me/jana bottom lane vs graves/alistar.  They could not do anything to us either and we just completely dominated the lane.  I did not put a point into q until it forced me to.  I used my ki strike to harras and last hit.  Nothing they did could force us out of lane.

As far as item build
Going against ranged ad in lane, start with thornmail/ninja tabi, then work into force of nature.  Then a guardian angel.  The idea is to try and balance your defensive stats between armor and magic resist.  You can get the three in any order you want, just make sure that your first item is based on teh type of damage your facing in your starting lane.

For runes, flat armor yellows, mr per level blues, 1 flat armor quint, 2 flat mr quints.  For reds, pick up any defensive stat you want, can be flat or per level armor or MR.
For masteries, go full defensive with some points in utility.  Ill be more specific when I edit this post.  I gotta run out of the office for a couple hours, will update more then


TLDR: the sustain on shen with his shield makes him an immovable object in any lane.  Combine him with another tank/support bottom (like alistar) and they will completely control the mid to late game.

On a 1000 damage combo, this amounts to 80 damage if theyre less than 40% HP.

Alternatively you can go 21 in utility with only 9 in offence and grab a massive movespeed boost, gold over time, TONS of CDR, and some spellvamp/lifesteal. Also Biscuit OP.

So why do you run 21 in offence on stuff like Leblanc, Ryze, and Vlad when you could have so much more laning presence with 21 in utility?

1375712937.0,26,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1jqou6,Testing of experience quints on WW,Albaek,36,10,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1jqou6/testing_of_experience_quints_on_ww/,"There were a few skeptic people in my recent topic on my approach to WW. Specifically, the experience quints seemed to scare people away. So I decided to do some testing to show you how good they are. 

[Here is a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuFX8usHljhXdGZ5MGhVbURkZHRhck1nY2tDMzRESnc&amp;usp=sharing) that shows both the theory and testing.

You require 2500 experience to get level 6, and I marked it with green when you ding 6. Now, you may notice that I don't actually hit 2500 experience with 1,11 modifier (exp quints + exp masteries), but I do in reality. The reason that I hit 6 is because jungle minions give more experience the further into the game you are. It's not a lot, and it's barely noticeable (see the bottom of the spreadsheet), but in this scenario it allows me to get level 6 one camp faster than exp quints or exp masteries alone, and two camps faster if no exp masteries or quints.

As you may see, with 21/0/9 and ms or as quints I am unable to get level 6 before the buffs respawn. This is quite a big deal for WW as I basically gained nothing compared to other junglers who will get level 6 by killing the buffs, and they probably ganked a lot. In general I feel that WW gets very little off 21 offensive compared to utility. You miss out on Bladed Armor, bonus experience, CDR, movement speed and generally just a lot of good stuff by going offensive.

The difference between as and ms is to ms' favor, and on top of that ms is much better throughout the game, so attack speed quints are *never* the ideal to go for.

One could argue that ending at golems are not always ideal as it is hard for WW to gank the bot lane due to good ward coverage and ganking 2v2 lanes is hard due to how easy it is to cancel WW's ult. I agree with this to some extend. You're still a good 30 seconds ahead of regular level 6 time, and you need to utilize this.

Another thing to notice is that running ms quints with support masteries can be worth it as you end up at wolves, which is good for blue side (fast gank for top/mid). However, you will not have time to gank and back in most cases within 30 seconds. On the other hand, running exp quints allows you ensures both a gank as well as time to buy before the buffs respawn. It ultimately comes down to which side you play (you can see it in champion select on the ""Your team"" font). If you play blue side, then ending at golems is not the best, however at purple side being on golems can be very good. You have to remember you get 6 before most laners with this build, so you can most likely kill anything you come in contact with.

---

For the purpose of theorycrafting, the other runes I used was armor seals, CDR glyphs and attack speed marks. As for masteries, look at my [LoLking profile](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/19048861#masteries). Page 15 and 17 is the one used. Page 17 could probably be optimized a bit, but it won't change much with the clear speed. Also, Bladed Armor is quite significant to your clear time as it saves a few autoattacks so I would not advice skipping it.

As for items, I went with machete, mana pot and pink ward. The mana pot allows me to spam his Q a little bit more after the blue runs out.

1374987770.0,25,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1j7afh,Sultan of Solo-Queue: Phoenix Udyr,Kraz226,34,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1j7afh/sultan_of_soloqueue_phoenix_udyr/,"I'll try to condense this post as well as I can, but feel free to skip to the TL;DR below if you just want to get to the point. 

**Udyr is a top tier solo-queue contender, and I'll tell you why**. 

I've started to change my ranked playstye over the last few days. I've been meandering in the doldrums of Plat 5 for a couple months, and I figure a change is in order. I've started to play a hyper-aggressive Jungle/Top Udyr over the last few days and Ive seen great results. 

[Here's my LoLKing for anyone interested.](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/21630104#history)

I just wanted to list some observations I've made over the last few days. Partly for myself, since I'm trying to document my thoughts, and partly for anyone trying to expand their knowledge on this champion. Here are some things I've noticed. 

* Can farm *very* hard (thanks to Phoenix) 

This skill is amazing because it's essentially a 5 second Sunfire combined with a Tiamat Cleave on activation and on every third auto attack. Not to mention the fact that it's magic damage based, meaning jungle creeps and regular creeps take full damage since they have no MR. 

Having such a great AoE skill on short cooldown and low mana costs mean you can dominate mid game if you find yourself in a solo-lane with a wave or two all to yourself. You can receive a small gold advantage from it quickly while other junglers are not nearly as fast. 

* He thrives in a frenzy

Udyr gets picked apart in a competitive play environment (usually) because teams have focus and can quickly burst him down. In solo-queue this is not the case however. Usually enemy teams aren't peeling for their ADCs, supports are trying to land spells rather than kiting, and top laners and junglers aren't coordinating with their mids. 

In a wonky and disjointed teamfight, Udyr can easily take over. He can Turtle and just tank for his carries, can aggressively counter-initiate on tanks with Bear stance, deal heavy dps with Phoenix, chase down fleeing carries with Bear, and so forth. He also can build strong aura items like Frozen Heart, Aegis/Bulwark, Randuins, Locket, and even Abyssal to help his team while still being very strong as an individual. 

* Item Versatility 

Udyr is similar to Jax in that his item choices are usually custom tailored to beat his enemies. Against a big AoE magic comp? Bulwark/Wit's End/BV are viable options. AD assassins messing up carries? Grab Randuins/GA and laugh at their face. Fed Vayne? Randuins/Thornmail will make her cry. I could continue, but my point is simply that he can build a large percentage of the items in the store easily. 

* Dueling power

Once you get some early items, you are rarely going to meet anyone you fear. The only champions I have any trouble with are Trundle and Shyvana, and both of them can be beaten or simply run away from without much trouble. 

This should not be undervalued, it's part of the reason I love Udyr in general. No one wants to 1v1 a tanky Udyr, it's simply demoralizing to see him charge at you and still be able to tank most dps you throw at him with Turtle stance. 

* Doesn't suffer from power fluctuations

That's a fancy way of my saying that Udyr is the opposite of Lee Sin and J4. While both of those characters have a monster early-mid game presence, Udyr has that *and more*. You can't invade an Udyr because he clears extremely fast and can simply turn and stun you, and you definitely can't go ganking with no wards because he can react quickly with his extreme movement speed. 

He gets better with item, has good scaling and base stats, and even his mana costs get cheaper with levels! Meaning he can stay relevant from minute 1 to minute 60.

* Few counters

A mobile/farming playstyle has few counters. It takes a coordinated team to realize that they need to secure objectives and force tower fights while Udyr splitpushes (much like Tryndamere). Usually a solo-queue enemy team won't realize this and will instead opt to send 1-3 people to deal with Mr.ManBearPig. This is just what you want as Udyr however, you can waste people's time and kite just as well as Singed, and infuriate the enemy team while doing so. 

Not only is his playstyle hard to counter, as a character you will have a hard time finding a champion that can face Udyr on even footing and come ahead, as I said in the dueling point above. 


**TL;DR**: Udyr can farm hard, duel most anyone, dominate solo-queue teamfights, build lots of items, and more! I've been doing well with him and just want to talk about it.

http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/23848465#history

My history, it's shaky now but when i originally made this it was better haha (I let my girlfriend play on my account a bit) I feel that Zac is a top tier jungler, rivaling the strength of hecarim in late game carry potential and early game clear speed and rapid leveling.

9/0/21 is what I feel to be the best mastery setup, I used to use 9/21/0 very much but 9/0/21 let me beat both my solo lanes to level 6 and be the first to 18 with a 4 minute dc.

Runes are magic pen marks, armor seals, flat ap glyphs, flat ap quints. This mastery setup allows for 4(+1)% at lvl 1 with w, and this is ridiculous for clearing. I'm going to try to limit the amount of flat ap glyphs though so I can run more mr/lvl, so probably 3-5 flat ap glyphs and 6-4 mr/lvl glyphs.

I go 2 early points in w then max q, but ' considering an early 2nd or 3rd point in 3 for increased gank flexibility earlier. I have more info describing my builds and top I can edit in.

Edit: Just got out of game, my 1st game as 9/0/21 Zac was 11-4-11 and the next game was 17-7-17, If this gets any traction I'll go in depth.

My item build for jungle zac usually is standard machete 5 pots start, usually rush mobi boots if im ahead, if not i might get spirit stone then mobi boots then i usually go kindlegem or sunfire cape or if im fed haunting guise, if i go kindlegem I get spirit visage when the high threats on the enemy team are AP, sunfire cape otherwise then kindlegem and spirit visage unless no AP. After that I try to actually get rylais liandrys or more tank like warmogs or randuins but at some point I feel you always want liandrys rylais because it makes you do massive % health damage all around, my full build is usually:

Tanky boots, liandrys, rylais, spirit visage, sunfire cape, and warmogs/randuins and sometimes voidstaff.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1364767983.0,,,True,t3_1bcjud,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1bcjud/my_thoughts_on_zac/,

I'd like to talk about why this is, and what do you guys think of it.

As for masteries personally I'd prefer the tanky-jungler standard of 9/21/0. Runes would be preferably flat AD but I've heard of people running Armor Pen, Attack Speed, Lifesteal, and Armor. 

As for skill order is where this gets tricky. Nasus has a lot of freedom in choosing his skill lineup as opposed to most champs. From what I understand maxing Spirit Fire allows for the quicket clear time. Maxing Wither allows for downright brutal ganks, especially top lane. And, lastly, maxing Siphoning Strike for what I assume is for more damage against champions and not much else.

Personally I would have a point in each by level 3 and possibly max Spirit Fire first. Reason being is Nasus already has atrocious clear speed so if I could quicken it up and limit myself to wolves/wraiths I could level quicker and spend more time roaming/ganking/possibly counter jungling (don't forget, Nasus is an amazing duelist).

As for why people pick Nasus I think it's fairly straight forward. His ultimate grants him both HP and does %MaxHP damage over 15 seconds. His Wither is the bane of all auto attackers or more specifically AD carries. It either makes them near obsolete in a team fight or makes them easy pickings for your team to dive on. Lastly, Spirit Fire, where Black Cleaver's armor penetration was nerfed Spirit Fire has a flat 40 armor penetration to anyone who stays inside longer than 1 second.

He also fits with our meta of item builds in that he becomes absurdly tanky. Tanky aura items like Runic Bulwark and Locket of the Iron Solari are extremely cost effective and add onto Nasus's unkillable mode. Other items such as Frozen Heart, Iceborn Gauntlet, Randuin's Omen, Warmogs, Sunfire, Wriggle's Lantern and possibly many more all fit in with his playstyle and kit.

So, /r/leagueoflegendsmeta, what are your thoughts on jungle Nasus? Have you been playing him? What item builds, runes, masteries, and skill order do you prefer and why?

Currently, I've been trying out every single champ I can muster the IP to buy and give a shot, and I've come to the conclusion that my top 5 shall be as follows. 

* **Vi:** Single target damage, AoE damage, good AD scaling, good health scaling (with sustain due to shield), good CC, and decent base stats make her really well rounded. Her entire kit just has so much going for it and she can build so many ways that I just love playing her. 

* **Amumu**: Still has a rediculously broken skill set. Later on in the game when he has some items finished he's a teamfight monster who never dies and can initiate easily. Even with his slow/vulnerable early game, he wins later on easily. 

* **Fiddlesticks**: He's got a lot of ways to make the enemies melt while keeping high health. He also wrecks teamfights just as well as Amumu if you ult and use your fear properly. He doesn't even need to build too many damage items to destroy people thanks to his passive. Twin Shadows on this guy is amazing. 

* **Hecarim**: Does shit-tons of damage while having only one or two finished items. Frozen Fist, the new Spirit Stone items, and the Visage remake gave him a much easier way to itemize than the old Trinity Force rush, so now he doesn't feel as useless during mid game. He just ramps up so well that it's easy to get out of control due to his movement speed, initiation ability, and even his straight up dueling power late game. I'm honestly surprised he's not used in the pro scene more often. 

* **Sejuani**: Imagine if Mundo and Amumu had a baby and that baby was an ice-lady riding a giant pig. Sejuani is in a weird place where she was designed to be a tank (her ult), but she works more as an offtank with more of a focus on DPS (Mundo). She can't really hit anyone with hard CC when her ult isn't up, and she has no real ways to mitigate damage, so she's in a strange place in the meta. With all the S3 item changes, getting her damage into the stratosphere is as simple as having a Warmogs and a Liandry's Torment. Neither items will take the entire game to build, so you can just supplement it with some auras or tankiness and you're good to go. She's easily one of the stronger junglers in the game at the moment, but she hasn't been picked up by most junglers since she's been in the doldrums for so long. Mark my words, she's going to see a serious increase in popularity soon if people start realizing how good she is.

I posted this in r/lol but I feel people aren't as willing to be helpful so I decided to come here.

I've been obsessed with this champion for a while now and
have never found any guides to be insightful enough to help. I
often watch Bischu's midalee and it leaves me in awe every
single time. The main problem I have is with her pounce and
fighting.

I see bischu - and many other players - pounce perfectly
every time. I know she jumps in the current direction she is
facing but when I click W it feels like there's a 50/50
chance of me doing what I want. How do I master this skill?

My second problem is engaging after I've poked. I feel like I
can never do any damage in cougar form and when I get too
close I just get bursted down by AP carries, AD carries,
bruisers, supports (ok not really supports but you catch my
drift). What do I do in a 1v1 (I don't usually 5v5 as I'd rather
splitpush) to maximise my damage and increase my chances
of killing someone.

It worked extremely well with them winning both games. It wasn't designed to be a counterpick to jax apparantly as he played passive in lane, keeping even in farm with jax and not really trying for kills too much. In each game his build would be:

Boots 3 &gt; Dorans ring &gt; Sorcerers Shoes &gt; Feindish codex &gt; Athenes &gt; Zhonya's

It worked to particularly devastating effect in game 3 with a team comp including Katarina Mid and Ashe ADC.

Gragas worked brilliantly with both these champions, ashe has been quite popular this tournament with her ability to pick people off, gragas adds to this as ashe ulti allows you time to perfectly position gragas ulti to knock the stunned target back into your team allowing for a perfect safe pick off. Its a safe alternative to hard engage upon ashe ulti which gives you a guaranteed 4v5 period to push objectives.

He also has amazing synergies with katarina as he is a burst caster. Kat needs at least one target to die during the teamfight to start to unlock her potential. Gragas's burst allows a high amount of damage very quickly on a target to easily kill at least one member, unlocking kats damage.

He also provides great peel and Poke, attack speed slows OP.

As I tried Elise in several matches, I have noticed she falls off late game really easily. Because, even if you build her AP, the only skill that goes up really quickly is her Human form W, the exploding spiderling. Her Q in both Human and spider form only get 1 extra % for every 50 AP, and that is about 0.5-1 full item. Her W on spiderform has a 2% ap scaling. She is really weak when building ap and needs way to many ap for het abilities to do anything.

That's why I thought that Trinity force could be handy on her. One thing I have also noticed is that she isn't awfully quick. Her spider form gives her 10 flat movement, which isn't too much. Trinity force also gives movement speed. Next to that, you have a change to slow the enemies as well, which makes you able to kill them for sure, even if all abilites are on cooldown. And lastly, you get AD off of it, which is good if you consider her W in spider form, the 120% attack speed at level 5.

I am LoL_Teacher and I made this account primarily for answering questions/ helping others on any of the League of legends sub reddits. I feel I have been unsuccessful, even though I have had a couple of people come back to me to explain things (and how to think about builds/ items etc for themselves), due to lack of my explanation (laziness) or due to the lack of me answering a reasonable number of questions.

However I plan to go a step further (than just fix my laziness) and put some quality posts (I hope). My plan is to go into reasonable depth in each topic I write. I would first like to ask if anyone is interested in posts like this?

My current plan (topics which would each take a separate post):

* **Sleeper Champions/Builds** - Builds not Utilized, Positions not Utilized

* **Supports** - Builds, Items not Utilized, Warding, How to Play with an AD Carry, Aggression in lane and How to Receive Ganks

* **How to Figure out any Champion** - General mechanics and Item Builds

* **Theorycrafting 101** - Basic item Building and Basic Team Composition Building

* **Winning a Lane** - Comparing Mechanics, Counter Building, Finding Strengths and Weaknesses and Nuances of Lanes

* **How to win a game** - Basics on Teamwork, Individual Skills, Objectives, Counter Strategies, How to respond to a fed enemy, How to keep yourself or your teammates fed

If there no love for a particular subject or if there is something not on the list that you want feel free to post! If you feel this would be better suited in Summoner School or the general League of legends sub Reddit just say. Also for any reason someone would like to collaborate with me (i have no idea why xD) on a particular subject just ask and I will most likely say yes.

I will start writing these after tomorrow and see the response to determine whether or not I should continue from the feedback. (or wont even start if the general response to this is horrific).

1343485960.0,24,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,xarnf,"Gangplank, Then and Now.",Jabore,29,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/xarnf/gangplank_then_and_now/,"I have been playing LoL since beta, and Gangplank is one of my favorite champions. Riot has changed him [alot](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html) since he first came out, and he fills a different role now then he used to. To me, his kit seems to cheat the normal rules that other champions follow, and give him an advantage from the start that the other team must work to overcome.

**Then:** Back in the day, Gangplank used to be the king of passive play. He could deny creeps with his E, giving him a natural XP advantage while farming gold with Parrrley and stacking Avarice blades. He could sit back and gain a gold and xp advantage while using his ultimate for assists and kills in other parts of the map. I would run a full critical damage rune page giving me +%40 critical damage plus another +%10 from masteries such that with IE my critical hits would deal %300 damage. Buying PD and BT next after IE would give GP an insane poke that would often eat up over half of an opponents HP bar. The highest crit on my account remains 1504 to this day, and I achieved it using this build.

**Now:** Gangplank Can no longer shoot allied creeps, though his E is still a great steroid. He has a new skin and his passive now slows instead of inflicting grievous wounds. His ultimate has been tweaked, but remains one of the few truly global ultimates while most have been given maximum ranges. And his latest buff: Parrrley now gives back half its mana cost if it kills a unit. This one for me is the kicker. 

Most people have relegated GP to a class of sub-par top laners since trying to harass with Parrrley early game drains too much mana and Gangplank simply cannot win trades with most top laners. I don't think Gangplank was ever meant to win trades in his lane though. His power and advantage comes from his ability to survive and continue farming while building up more gold then his opponent. The only usefulness he lends to his team early game is his ultimate, but late game the most powerful part of his kit is that his Parrrley can crit with 120 bonus AD. 

These days I still keep +%20 crit dmg with red runes. Quints and seals are +5 bonus gold/10, and glyphs are + MR/lvl. 9-21-0 masteries with TP and Flash. I build Boots, Philosopher's stone, Avarice blade, Merc treads (or Ninja tabi situationaly), IE, PD, and FM, Then whatever I feel like. I have had some success with this build, although it relies on patience and caution until you farm your advantage.

What do you think? Is my build a revolutionary work of genius, or a sad token of a build that fit into a past meta? Do you miss days when Zil and GP were unstoppable bot lane, or do you prefer the pirate swag his new skin brings? Lets discuss Gangplank.

There was something about it that I always found so charming.  For a while, I'd only play champions that could leverage it's unique stat distribution.  I found that Gragas tended to wield it best.  The flat bonus attack damage from Drunken Rage synergized well with it's attack speed and the cooldown was often enough to put me at cap.  Nowadays, raw AP just performs so much better on him, but I often look back at his days of dentistry with great fondness.

Which brings me to the focus of our discussion: Stinger.  Perhaps the item's greatest weakness is that it only builds into Nashor's Tooth.  On it's own, it's an incredible value, providing the same attack speed as a Recurve Bow with the added benefit of 10% CDR **for only 40 more gold**.  On top of that, it builds from two Daggers making it easy to ""curve"" into the item as the game progresses, should you choose to pick it up early.  The obvious problem, though, is the space it occupies in your inventory as late game approaches.

Is it then completely without merit?  On junglers, especially Jax, grabbing one after a Wriggle's feels really good (try it) before moving on to a Gunblade or Trinity Force.  Given that most junglers don't invest in Doran's items, the space it hogs doesn't feel intrusive and there is always the possibility of upgrading it into a Tooth.

What are your thoughts?  I feel that Jungle Jax is possibly the best candidate to hold on to a Stinger, but who else could utilize this item?  Do they have to be a champion that will eventually turn it into a Tooth or is selling it late game viable?

Why is Sej so underplayed? She ganks incredibly well, even pre-6. She is incredibly tanky, offers so much incredible control, has a god-tier initiate and a strong teamfight presence.

Obviously she is team dependent; you don't want to play sej if you don't have damage in your lanes. I recognize her clear times aren't mundo/shyv/lee speed, and her match-ups are rough, but she contributes so much in a gank and late game teamfights. She is harder to kill than shyv, and brings more cc than mao or rammus. 

If a game looks like I'm not going to get ganks I go HoG, boots, philo, Kindlegem, merc treads, catalyst/Banshees, shurelyas, iron locket. 

If their team is pushing a lot/my team can't handle their lanes I'll rush a shurelya's for the ghost on ganks. Landing a Q+E typically means a kill, and at the very least a forced back.

* AD carry top. We've seen this more and more, and vayne, corki and graves seem to be able to do fine in most setups. Also, they shit on most of the bruiser.

* Bruiser mid. They survive the ennemy burst and then go in and take them down.

1376628380.0,23,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1kgx8m,Let's talk about Gunblade,Rawnix,27,4,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1kgx8m/lets_talk_about_gunblade/,"So, if you're going to say ""OMG NO ONE BUILDS GUNBLADE ON AHRI NOOB"", please leave the thread.

Recently I've been playing a lot of Akali and Katarina. Both of these champions used to have Gunblade as a core item, but people tell me it's suboptimal in S3. Gunblade itself is a very expensive item, but is it worth building on the following champions:

Ahri, Akali, Katarina, Jax, Tryndamere (AP), Evelyn, Gragas, Kayle (AP), Kogmaw (AP), Nidalee (Bruiser), Teemo (Hybrid)

I realize you're probably very skeptical about some of these, but let's take a look at Gunblade's stats vs Deathcap, a similarly priced item

**Deathcap:** 120 AP and 30% increased AP (Granting a total of 156 AP)

**Gunblade:** 65 AP, 45 AD, 12% LS, 20% SV and an amazing active.

How amazing is gunblades active? It depends on which champion you're using it on. On AP Heavy champions who AA frequently, Gunblade is exceptionally powerful. It's active is an addition .4AP scaling ability with a very low Cooldown, as it only takes 20 Auto attacks to reset gunblade's CD. It also enhances your auto attack damage, which isn't that effective on something like LeBlanc but can be extremely potent on Teemo or Kayle.

Let's take a look at it champion by champion

**Akali:** She doesnt AA much, but she does use single-target abilities frequently. Gunblade also compliments her passive, granting her an additional 7% spellvamp from the AD it gives. The main issue with this on Akali is that her damage spike comes from AP, so Deathcap is definitely a higher damage item. That being said, spellvamp on Akali is extremely powerful since she has such high burst and can easily keep her alive throughout a fight when combined with stealth. My verdict is that it's still good on her if you expect to be taking a lot of AOE damage.

**Ahri**: I'm conflicted about Gunblade on Ahri. I feel like rushing the Cutlass would give you AMAZING lane presence due to Ahri's range, innate sustain, and high base damage. Her foxfire counts as a single target attack, so you can reset Gunblade's active relatively quickly, but at the same time Deathcap is an amazing item on Ahri. My verdict is that it would be VERY niche on her but could work in the right situation.

**Katarina**: I play a LOT of Kat. I play her both top and mid. While she does have decent AD Scaling on her ult and an ""okay"" scaling on her W, the scaling on her W doesnt matter much because you aren't there for sustained DPS, you're there to burst people down and get out when you can. I feel like WOTA would just completely outclass Gunblade on Katarina in her current state, so the verdict is dont buy it.

**Jax**: I've tested it myself several times, and it's marvelous on him. A BORK &gt; Gunblade &gt; Tanky items build has let me roll midgame and maintain relevance late game. He can reset it's active really quickly, often being able to use it twice in one fight. It's a great item on him. Verdict: Not core, but damn good.

**AP Tryn:** I've never played AP Tryn myself, but Gunblade rush makes a lot of sense on him. Early game AD, even on AP Tryn, is really strong due to his passive. I feel that rushing Cutlass would give you even more sustain in lane and confuse your enemy into building armor. Verdict: Possibly would work very well.

**Evelyn**: Eve is really strong in SoloQ right now as a tanky magic damage initiator. I'm not sure how well Gunblade would work with a build like that, but I feel like just building tanky AP items would work better. Also, Eve doesn't benefit much from spellvamp since she's usually the one doing the initiating and by the time she needs the spellvamp either her team or the enemy team is already dead. Verdict: Dont buy it, waste of stats.

**Grargas**: I could see Gunblade being really strong on Grargas in lane, but not because of its active. Grargas gains huge AD from his channeled W, and his bodyslam scales with AD fairly well. He could potentially be a powerful duelest top lane with it. He cant reset the active very fast however, so that part is almost wasted. Verdict: Niche pick, but has potential

**AP Kayle**: Another champion I love, I've built Gunblade and Rageblade on Kayle in games where I find myself splitpushing frequently in order to kill towers faster. I know for a fact this purpose works very well, however it's definitely a niche item on her as Deathcap and Nashor's Tooth are far more important and Gunblade is very expensive. Verdict: Niche item

**AP Kogmaw**: Kogmaw's ultimate has decent AD scaling and he has some rather large AA range with his W up. Additionally he could reset the active on Gunblade very fast. The only problem is that Kogmaw will rarely be in range to USE the active. For this reason, I wouldnt buy it. Verdict: Bad item on him

**Bruiser Nidalee**: Tested over the course of several games, and it works pretty well. She makes good use of the active and can use Cutlass to bully her lane opponent really well. Gunblade &gt; Gauntlet rush gives her a good bit of AP and defensive stats while making her damage spike pretty high in duels. Verdict: Works really well on her, but Rageblade can serve the same purpose for less gold.

**Teemo**: AP or Hyrbid build's can easily include Gunblade on Teemo. It works wonders on him due to how much he AA's. People say he doesnt benefit from spellvamp much, but it actually turns him into an incredibly strong duelest who can take just about anyone. A simple shroom &gt; Q combo can heal you for insane amounts. Verdict: Core on Hybrid, great on AP.

So after that, let's hear what you guys think about Gunblade! Any weird champions you build it on?

1374542045.0,22,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1iuqqk,Tiger Udyr in the Jungle,JFKShouldveLOSd,31,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1iuqqk/tiger_udyr_in_the_jungle/,"Hello friends.

With the recent release of the best skin in league of legends, I would like to share with you my success with Udyr.

Even with Udyr's tweaks a few months ago, he hasn't seen a huge amount of play. However, since season 2, he has been one of my go-to junglers.

Until very recently, I had always been a huge fan of phoenix udyr in the jungle, especially with the change that made your first hit proc the  fire breath. That was until I started messing around with tiger.

Before I get into items/playstyle, just the basics:

I've been running 9/21/0 masteries. For runes, I run AD reds, armor yellows, MR blues, 2 AD quints, and 1 LS quint.

I start doran's blade.

We have seen this in the LCS on nintendude, but not a whole lot otherwise since S2. However, it meshes with tiger udyr absolutely perfectly. Because of the changes to the attack speed on tiger, you can q for the DoT in the jungle, and keep your attack speed bonus while switching to turtle for lifesteal. Swapping back and forth keeps you very healthy, even with dorans.

With the doran's start, Udyr is by far one of the scariest counter junglers in the game. In a game the other night, I 1v1'd a Lee sin who started machete when he tried to invade my jungle. We both had double buffs, were level 3, full health and he even ran ignite instead of flash. I ate his q to the face and his ignite. I still came out ahead and got FB with 1/3 of my health left.

Your ridiculous dueling power gives you complete control over the enemy jungle. You are free to invade without fear of dying 1v1 to their jungler, and bear + turtle can get you out of many sticky 2v1 situations. I almost always get away from going my blue -&gt; their red, and can finish it before they even get close. If I feel comfortable, I fight and they have to blow flash or die.

On top of your dueling potential, maxing tiger gives you INSANE ganks. If you have red buff and you get a decent angle for the gank, you will blow flash or get a kill 99% of the time.

Finally, to me it seems that tiger udyr is one of the few tanky junglers who is able to snowball and carry games. I tend to buy a cutlass after spirit of the ancient golem if I'm doing decent, and finish BotRK later in the game depending on how well I'm doing.

Opposed to phoenix udyr, the only thing you give up is a little clear speed. Doing the small camps takes a bit of extra time; you will mow down the big wraith/wolf/golem, but then have to turn to finish off the little ones. You definitely can bring down red/blue much faster than phoenix udyr.

If you have been itching to use your udyr skin, give tiger udyr + dorans start a try. You won't be disappointed.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1iuqqk,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1iuqqk/tiger_udyr_in_the_jungle/,

I build udyr tanky ap with ROA serpahs zonyas nashors but I think the most important time to check dmg around mid game team fights. so ill compare the champs dmg with just roa (60 ap) and their main skill maxed 

**Singed**

* MAGIC DAMAGE PER SECOND: 22 / 34 / 46 / 58 / 70 (+ 30% AP)
70+( .3*60)=88

* 1 second 182

* 2 second 276

* 3 second 370

* 4 second 464



**Udyr**

phoenix

* MAGIC DAMAGE PER WAVE(per sec): 15 / 25 / 35 / 45 / 55 (+ 25% AP)

* 55 + .25*60= 70
* MAGIC DAMAGE PER phoenix proc: 40 / 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 (+ 45% AP)

* 200 + .45*60= 227


* 1 second 70 +proc 236 = 306
* 2 second 376
* 3 second 451 +proc 236= 687

My team kept calling me bad for this and they justified it by saying that I died so I was wrong and that I am bad. I thought it was a good idea but we typically would die because diana would get trapped in my ult after she would dive their ADC.

For your last 4 points in offense you get 6 armor pen and 5% damage increase against targets below 50% hp. For the 4 points in utility you gain 3% lifesteal and +1.25% exp increase.

**Pros of 21 offense**

-you gain 6 armor pen. as a character who basically outputs only physical damage, this is a pretty sweet deal

-5% damage increase against champs below 50% hp. this is pretty nice, making every 100 damage in essence 105 damage as a fight goes on. 

**Cons of the offense tree**

-Lategame 6 armor pen is negligable, at least against the characters that will most likely be your first targets, that is the tank line. 

-Gives no survivability what so ever.

**Pros of utility**

-3% lifesteal gives you some nice sustain throughout the whole game, as lifesteal is one of those statistics that just doesn't fall off. 

-The 1.25% exp gives you 6 before your lane opponent, all other things being equal. this means that you can all in them when you have ultimate and they don't

**cons of the utility tree**

-The lifesteal, while giving good sustain mid/late, early it's only going to give you about 1-2 hp per auto for a while.

-All things equal early game their adc will have more damage than you given the 6 pen.

I rarely see him top or jungle anymore and I'm trying to figure out what can put him back into things.

The last few champ releases haven't helped him. He is supposed to counter 'melee auto attack dependent champions'. Why is this? This is because of the mechanics of his E, the passive on his ult, his ult itself and even his w. Except looking back at champ releases (Quinn, Thresh, Vi, Nami, Zed, Elise, Khazix, and Syndra, the season 3 releases) and only Vi really uses her auto attacks and even then, its not the core point of her kit. From that, all the bruiser/top lane picks have been popular recently.

Items. Trinity got nerfed. GA got nerfed. The two items that made him so strong. What went well for him? Bilgewater Cutlass got a new upgrade. Guinsoo's Rageblade got a rework. Warmogs got a buff. Sheen got a new path. But what do you build?

I have to admit, its been a struggle trying to get a build working. I usually rush the BotRK since it allows you to all in and get the kill quite easily. Next, I buy a sheen, just a sheen. I find its proc to be very useful without committing to the cost of the full upgrade. Next? Warmogs. This might change soon, but since his ult gives resistances, Warmogs seems like such a good idea. After that? Either upgrade sheen or build Rageblade. Iceborne Gauntlet can't be the worst item, its just you trade the Zeal on Trinity for Glacial Shroud.

His weakness is that he can't gank well until level 6 and you have to dive into the middle of a fight to do your role. Many of the popular junglers are so popular because they have early CC and gap closers. Warwick doesn't have either until he gets his ult. 

His big strengths are safety, his attack speed aura, and early itemization options. 

**Safety** Warwick's safety in the jungle allows you to countergank efficiently. Since Warwick can take red first just as easily as blue you can take the opposite path your opponent will likely take so you can fend off their ganks. 

**Attack Speed** has become more expensive in season 3 but Warwick gives it away like candy on Halloween. Pushing towers is easy when you have a 40% attack speed buff on everybody who's attacking the turret.

**Early itemization options** Warwick only needs at most two potions to start off with. This allows you to pick up an early ward and give your teammates vision they wouldn't otherwise have. Early wards can give your teammates the heads up on an incoming gank and since your ganks are fairly lackluster pre-6 you need the ability to help out your lanes somewhat. 

Warwick is best against a poke comp since he can heal off their poke by autoattacking or Q'ing. He also has a good engage if your team can follow it up. Conversely, he is not strong on a poke comp. He has to wade into the scrum and that's kinda not what a poke comp is all about.

Warwick synergizes well with autoattacking AD carries. Graves and Corki don't get as much out of the attack speed buff as Caitlyn or Tristana will. He does very well with Blitzcrank or Thresh since they can grab an opponent while you're ulting to pull them in. 

I'm not claiming Warwick is terribly strong or overpowered but he does have strengths that go unnoticed and I wanted to bring them to the conversation.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_19sf79,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/19sf79/warwick_actually_seems_strong_at_my_level/,
1360042468.0,25,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,17x2hu,"A mathematical analysis on the strength of Tristana's Rapid Fire, and some tidbits on Armor, AD, and Armor Penetration.",Bulzeeb,25,0,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/17x2hu/a_mathematical_analysis_on_the_strength_of/,"Hello everyone, I'm Bulzeeb, and I wanted to post an analysis I did on the strength of ranking Tristana's Q, Rapid Fire, at various points in the game. The reason I did the analysis was that I wanted to see if it would be worth ranking Q over Rocket Jump, her W, under specific circumstances after its mana cost buff. Along the way, I calculated some factoids a mathcrafter might want to know, about the average armor values of AD carries at level 1 and 9, and about how much what damage increase AD and Armor Penetration runes would provide, which I'll post at the end. As you probably have figured out already, this post will be very text and math heavy. I'll post the factoids in a comment in this thread to save space.

In order to save space, I'll get straight to the conclusion of my calculations: Tristana should do 97 pure damage per autoattack at level 9, and 30 extra pure damage per rank of W against the average AD carry. The first rank of Q will increase her damage per second by 19 and each subsequent rank will increase it by 9.5 damage per second. [Here is a link](http://www.pastebin.com/n4sjpn2R/) to the rest of my calculations if you want to fact check me. I don't claim to be perfect in either my math or my reasoning, so my results could be wrong, though I don't think they are.

So what's the cut-off point for needing to attack before your faster autoattacks can outdamage W's increase in magic damage? Well, looking at its rank 1 value, it seems that it will match it very quickly, in a little over 1.5 seconds. Every subsequent rank will require that you keep attacking for a little over 3 seconds. In any situation where you were going to use your W for damage against an enemy, it can be assumed that you are allowed to attack for at least 3 seconds, as you will be in melee range. This means that with this set-up, a Tristana with 5 points into Q will outdamage a Tristana with 5 points into W after 3 seconds of autoattacking. Q-first Tristana will also continue to deal more and more damage as she gains more items.

Now, it's not all good for Rapid Fire. W still has many advantages over Q. Its damage is up-front, meaning if an enemy dies to quick burst it is a stronger spell. It gains some CD per level, which is nice in general. It deals AOE damage to clumped up enemies (though wanting to jump onto more than one enemy is very rare), and on kills and assists it resets, allowing for even more damage. In these cases, Tristana can get very high numbers for ranking W, at least 90 damage per rank, making it much stronger than Q. Getting hit by CC or Exhaust will greatly reduce Q's strength. And possibly the most important factor is that these numbers only become true once you reach 137.5 attack damage. At all lower levels of AD, Q is worse than my reported values, though by how much of a factor I'm not sure. Lastly, these numbers are only as high as they are because I chose armor pen runes. If you take AD runes instead for better farming, Q becomes weaker than the reported value (though not by a huge amount).

However, Q has a lot of innate advantages over W as well, namely the fact that it is not all-in, it scales better numerically into late game, and it's a much safer spell for team fights. Once her range starts to get high, it also becomes more intelligent to kite lower ranged ADs with your 600+ range, instead of jumping onto them, though it's very difficult to maintain full attack speed while doing so. Q also works very well with Lulu (who adds 39 pure damage per autoattack with her passive at level 9) and Janna (who provides 37 pure damage while the shield persists under these conditions).

TL;DR: It's possible to max Q over W in situations where your autos are buffed by your support and you can't go all-in, and your damage output in all-ins will not be gimped once you reach level 9. After level 9 the advantage of Q-first continues to grow. In situations where you can go all-in, W first is still strong.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_17x2hu,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/17x2hu/a_mathematical_analysis_on_the_strength_of/,

She was one of my main ""off-junglers"", and a situational pick depending on the CC.

This patch note: 

&gt;Death Lotus
&gt;Total ability power ratio increased to 2.0 from 1.75

What did you say? Yeah, they buffed her ultimate so it would do more damage with less AP. Letting you build tanky while still doing the same amount of damage.

Just hold on for a second, there's another thing that came around this patch.

&gt;Seeker's Armguard (New Item)
&gt;Recipe: Cloth Armor + Cloth Armor + Amplifying Tome + 125 gold = 1160 gold
&gt;+30 armor
&gt;+25 ability power
&gt;Unique passive: Kills grant 0.5 bonus armor and ability power. This bonus stacks up to 30 times.

Boom, AP Armor item that's pretty cost efficient. Since you're jungling, the stacks adds up fairly quick. Let's do the math: 

&gt;Cloth Armor costs 300 Gold, gives 15 armor, that means 3 cloth would give 45 armor for 900 gold
&gt;Amplifying tome costs 435 gold and gives 20 AP, 2 Amp Tomes would cost 870 gold.
&gt;This means﻿ that in order to get the same stats that Seeker does with basic items you'd spend 1770 Gold.

[Seeker's Armguard - In Depth Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbJKRDoQUiA)

My Jungle Kat revolves around two core items: Wriggle's Lantern and Seeker's Armguard.

* Seeker's: 45 armor + 40 AP fully stacked.
* Wriggle's Lantern: 30 armor (Passive + Stats is way more efficient than Spirit of the Spectral Wraith. Also, a free shunpo to a ward.)
You'll be sitting around 75 bonus armor with items alone.

At base stats, that's about 110 armor at level 6. (You can easily get these items before then.)

As for starting runes, get armor seals, and AD quints/markets, and MR glyphs. Why AD? Her W is your main clear, and her AD ratio is higher than her AP ratio on it. (25% ap, 60% ad)

Worried about her initial clear? Most people would assume she would go red buff route, but in actuality the CDR from blue buff leaves her much safer, and a faster clear time. Start W, it's a 4 sec AOE clear with good damage. Combined with blue buff, it drops to a 3 second cooldown. Max W, R, and then E. I want to rush 6 ASAP, but don't ignore teammates.

Your armor should be covered. Build a Rylai's for more HP, and then an abyssal scepter for MR. Then it's pretty much whatever situation you're in.

**EDIT:**

Here's a more optimal build path as suggested by Clyspe:
Machete + 5 pots &gt; Madreds &gt; Boots + Amplifying Tome &gt; Seeker's Armguard. It's leaner, and helps you get enough armor and AP faster.

please never try this, **kat is a sub-par jungler** but I like the idea of playing her.

What builds have you tried in both the jungle and in top lane that have worked for you?

I haven't had the chance to play her too much but there's a few items that I know will be good on her.

* Black Cleaver - Seems like a must buy core item in every game.
* Frozen Mallet - The slow to stick to targets, and the HP to buff your passive
* BT / BotRK - Awesome damage for her ratios, extra survivability from the lifesteal
* Maw of Malmortus - Damage, MR, a bubble.  What's not to like here?  This item feels pretty core to me


I think a standard build against the typical team would look something like Black Cleaver, Frozen Mallet, Maw of Malmortus, Guardian Angel.  If you're snowballing you can switch out the Maw for a BT / BotRK.  The build gives you plenty of damage to dish out the pain, and a bunch of HP for her passive and resistances to keep you alive after diving into the middle of the fight.

What do you guys think?


***EDIT***

So after playing a gew games last night here are the results!

Build order
* Wriggles
* Brutalizer
* Phage
* Tier 2 boots
* Black Cleaver
* Frozen Mallet

This build is what I really see as core on her for jungling, and I never got much past this as the games were ending right around here.  I went hugely positive in every single game, my worst game being 7-4-7.  I had a great time with her, and I think her ganks are very strong coming from the jungle.

I also had great success grabbing a few extra wards and warding the enemy jungle for coutuner jungling purposes.  I found that as long as you save your Q to escape if necessary, you can get out of a lot of hairy situations in the enemy jungle.  Awesome counterjungling capablilties!

Team fighting I found to be interesting.  Maybe it was a function of my being fed but I often found myself being focused in team fights.  That said I usually waited for a fight to break out and then ulted in on the AD / AP carry knocking the rest of the team away and focusing that squishy down.  I find her role to be much like Irelia, in that she can close the gap and get in on a squishy and DECIMATE them in seconds.

I found that with this core build, even 30:00 into the game I was doing MASSIVE damage.  Pretty much any squishy that I got a hold of was a guaranteed kill.  I feel like her playstyle is similar in some senses to Akali.  If you have good wards and can catch anyone all alone, you're going to kill them with relative ease.  She has great ganks, great teamfight, and awesome dueling capabilites!

He wins all the matchups that Teemo would win, plus others because of his burst from expunge and his passive. His range means that you can outpoke any melee champ, and the passive means that you win pretty much every trade. His Ambush makes it so that it's virtually impossible to to get killed in a gank even if you push all the way to the tower, and you can easily kill the enemy by simply walking into a bush stealthing (or be like Wukong and make them think you did, forcing them to retreat and lose a bit of cs and xp) walking behind them and killing them.

Instead of building like an AD carry though, it really helps to build kinda like Irelia or AS Shen with Ionic Spark and Wit's End. the reasoning behind this is that you are going to be top lane and at some point you are going to be trading blows, so you are gonna want some tankiness to fulfill that role of a tankydps. Next you want that extra attackspeed to get the stacks off as quickly as possible without stayingg much closer than you have to for too long. They also synergize well with his Ambush to quickly get off those procs and his ultimate because you can proc both Ionic spark and Wit's end multiple times with one shot. ie. If you attack 4 times, the 4th hit will proc the chain lightning * the number of enemies hit. So if you hit 5 enemies with your ult on the 4th attack, you are gonna be dealing 550 Aoe magic damge to the enemy team in addition to your bonus AD and the stacks which will then allow you to activate Expunge. What I love about this build is that it deals a great amount of mixed damage (True from the passive, Magic from the items, and Physical from autos and Expunge). Due to the say his ultimate works, it's also viable to build things like Tiamat for that added AD for expunge and the insane amount of damage you do in teamfight when used in conjunction with your ultimate. I haven't tested it yet, but I think building a Gunblade wouldn't be a bad idea on the new Twitch. Now the reason for this isn't mainly his skills, but because Ionic Spark procs spellvamp, a proc you are going to be getting a lot of with your ultimate. Additionally, Expunge scales off AP and procs the spellvamp. The active is also useful for chasing and securing kills. These are just some thought's I've had on Twitch and I think that he can do a lot of things that other champions can't do effectively. His early game is stronger and his laning phase is more solid, so I think that people should give the new Twitch a chance.      P.S. Jungle Twitch now is a lot more like Shaco which is incredibly strong, his ganks are better than Shaco in my opinion because of the longer ranged slow, better burst, longer stealth duration, and much more consistent strong damage at earlier levels. His invades are also insane, whether in the top lane or in the jungle, at any point in time you can just Ambush and walk into the enemy jungle, pop ult, Venom Cask, Exhaust and there isn't much they can do to stop you. 

I'd love it if I could get a bit of feedback.



Edit. I think a few people are getting confused, i am referring to post-remake Twitch, his Stealth activates faster, he does better damage at early levels, and scales into late game even if not fed a ridiculous amount of kills

Edit 2. I think you guys should really try him out in the top lane first before you say that he doesn't work. I think a lot of the doubt of his ability to handle champions 1 v 1 in the top lane stems from comparing him to the old Twitch. Just completely forget the thoughts of old Twitch and look at him for what he is, an almost completely different champion.

From here either finish triforce/Frozen Mallet/ Maw/ Hextech/ Shureliya's or randuins. Completely situational. 

If your jungler is pretty tanky, and you're running a Tank support, AND if you're owning lane and want a fast finish instead of the normal win lane lose game that accompanies Udyr, go gunblade-&gt;bloodthirster-&gt;GA.

Build GA whenever you build udyr like Riven. 

EDIT: Adding this section because this is what most Udyr players have problem with.

""Win lane lose game""

Udyr is a beast in lane. His Q/W make him very hard to trade with, his E is a hard CC which is great to escape ganks/ coordinate them. But when teamfights come around, udyr sort of sucks. Most team comps are impossible to bumrush because you either get kited or melted. And udyr's only way to get to someone is bumrush them. To avoid win lane-lose game you need to balance your build for both phases of the game, and be a good last hitter.

Lane winning items:
Bloodthirster, Black Cleaver, doran blades, doran shield(very situational) and AD generally.

Making these items will improve your laning phase, but at some cost to your teamfight utility.

Game winning items:
shureliya, randuins, FoN, Frozen Mallet, Hextech gunblade, HoG, philo, Frozen heart, QSS, Guardian Angel


Making these items will make you strong during teamfights, but will not allow you to dominate or cripple your lane opponent.

Hybrid:
Hexdrinker, phage, Maw, Triforce, cutlass

These help during both phases of the game.

If you don't choose a good balance of these items(and some I'm forgetting for sure) then you will maybe win lane but lose game. If you try to build too many game winning items you won't deny your lane opponent or kill him and as a result you won't really have the money to buy all of them. 

Try it out in normals first as you really need a feel of when to commit, as gunblade-&gt;Bear stance can normally catch most things, but with mobility creep you really need to use your judgement. If you can catch your target there really isn't anything that can win a trade vs you with your tiger proc + sustain|shield from turtle. If you can't catch your target you will get kited and die without doing any damage.

TLDR. **Ahri, Sona, Orianna, Kennen, and Nidalee would do big damage if built as an AD carry.** [Did some math](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/oytq9/unconventional_ad_carries/c3l7t6b) on a poster's suggestion. Orianna and Kennen do enough dps to work as AD carries. Ahri *might* work, but would have a lot less dps. [More math comparing Triforce Sona to Caitlyn and Tristana in terms of dps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/oytq9/unconventional_ad_carries/c3lawbp)


I saw a tournament with AD Kennen and that got me thinking about what is actually required to be an AD carry. Since anyone with good AS stats will do huge damage with PD and IE I think AD carry is a more flexible role than it seems.

Conventional AD carries:

* Have range
* Have a strong steroid
* Have moves that scale with AD

I think the requirements for an unconventional AD carry are:

* Have range
* Have a good autoattack animation
* Can lane against conventional AD carries 
* Has some sort of utility that makes up for not having a strong steroid
* Has decent stats

Given these criteria I think  Ahri ~~and Zilean~~ could make good AD carries.


Ahri pros:

* Hard CC
* Good sustain
* Very mobile
* Good stats

Ahri cons:

* No steroid

---

Zilean Pros:

* Two lifes
* Good base dmg on skills
* Good range (600)
* Moves fast

Zilean Cons:

* Subpar auto attack animation
* No steroid 
* Low base armor. 



Out of these I think Ahri is the best candidate for a successful unconventional AD carry. Her strongest selling points are her good stats, her extreme mobility, and her hard cc. 

The other unconventional AD carry with potential is Zilean. Zilean has a large range of 600. He can speed boost himself to give himself perfect positioning. He can peel enemies with his slow. He can give himself a second life with his ultimate. His bombs should give him strong lane presence. His downside is a low base armor and a wonky autoattack animation.

The meta in LoL is not the most dynamic thing we have ever seen. Riot keeps releasing bruisers, which further reinforce how we play the game.

But every time a potentially interesting champion comes along, we all cry ""NERF"" or ""BUFF"" until the champ requires a nerf. Riot has tried with a lot of champions to change what is being offered: Rumble (new resource system), Renekton (new resource system), Riven (new way of controlling), Graves (Tanky DPS/AD carry hybrid)...and there are more (Xerath, etc.). Now, we cried until Rumble was nerfed, Graves is about to be nerfed, and Riven is UP (Renekton is kind of balanced, but gets little play). These champions were nerfed because we, as a community, asked for it. We said, ""I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS, MUST BE OP, MUST NEED A NERF"".

So, we complain that the meta is stagnant, but then we complain that new things are OP? Doesn't that seem counterproductive?

What can Riot do? They either nerf everything and keep the customers ""happy"" until they realize that nothing is changing, or they can ignore the customers and have them unhappy right now.

Let's not make this mistake again with Graves (although it's probably already too late). He's a game changer: an AD carry that can actually compete with bruisers, who can stop them when they get up close, but still fills the traditional carry role. It seems/looks/feels OP, right?

* Tristana - (Took advantage of this)
* Taric - 30 from shatter and 20 from Stark's Fervour
* Nocturne --
* Nasus - 40 from Spirit Fire
* Karthus - 35 from the wall

This adds up to a maximum of 125 armor reduction, making much the armour you buy worthless.

However, I also realized how powerful it was when combined with locket of the Iron Solari in helping keep your team alive. So lets talk about this combo.    
  
* *Eleisa's Miracle
Unique Passive – Aid: Your Summoner Heal, Clarity and Clairvoyance cooldowns are reduced by 25% (This is wrongly reflected on Riot's website, and recently in game, as 30%) 
Unique Passive – Eleisa's Blessing: If you gain 3 levels with this item, you gain all the effects permanently and this item is consumed.*    
  
* *Heal  
Heal heals oneself for 75 + 15 × level and every allied unit for the same amount.*     
   
Eleisa's Miracle(25%) AND the Mastermind mastery (10%) stack multiplicatively, granting a cool down of 201.6/195.3/189 seconds for heal.     
  
This means that every 201.6/195.3/189seconds (lvl 1, 2, and 3 of mastermind respectively) you get a 75hp+ 15hp*level heal. At level 10 that is a 225hp heal.    
  
* *Locket of the Iron Solari  
Unique: Shield yourself and nearby allied champions for 5 seconds, absorbing up to 50 (+10 per level) damage. 60 second cooldown. (600 range)*    
    
Now, the locket of the Iron Solari gives 50+10xlvl ehp to each ally on your side. So at level 10, you get a 150hp heal to each of your allies, EVERY 60 seconds.    
    
So if you have both, that means at lvl 10, a support can negate 375hp for everyone on his team. That's after resists have been reduced. That is basically Orianna's ultimate at lvl 3 prior to calcuating resists.    
    
Basically, I believe that this could be a very powerful way for a support to effect the success of the team during teamfights against AOE compositions. But there are some things to address.    
      
* So why bother with Eleisa's Miracle?    
   
Well, I find that the reduced cooldown of heal is very important, since it will have a cooldown that closer matches that of the ultimates of an AOE comp (3 minutes rather than 5 minutes).     
  
* Why not exhaust?    
  
Well, clearly exhaust is a great spell to have as a support since it aids you in winning your lane, getting picks, and stopping hypercarries.  But specifically against AOE teamcomps, I feel that it won't be nearly as useful, since AOE teamcomps just rely on their ultimates to destroy enemies, rather than dueling (which exhaust gives you the edge in). Exhaust is not bad, but sometimes other summoner's are better.    
  
* Will it set me too far behind?    
  
In the short run? Probably, in the long run? Probably not. Given that the cost of an Eleisa's miracle is considerably cheaper than a Shurelya's, and how it gives you a permanent powerup, it won't hurt you in the long run. I suggest that you build a sightstone before building your philo into an eleisa's, as that way you'll be able to ward up for your allies after you lose the gp5. It might be better for the jungle to build aegis as well, as your gold income will be a bit low.

In my opinion getting both is delaying strong items like rylais which singed thrives on during mid game. Personally I buy crystalline flask, rush tear then go straight into rylais. The reason why i get tear over catalyst is because I play singed very aggresively in laning phase and I dont get too much sustain from catalyst because im not playing passively. Anyway I would like your opinions because to me it feels like tear is the stronger than catalyst and it is not worth at all to get both.

EDIT: 
To give an example of a player every singed player (or league player for that matter) should know of is dyrus. If you look at his builds in lcs and soloque he has adopted the build of rushing both items and so have other pro players, because they are using these items their fans start to do so aswell. I for one have seen quite a few singed players now using both. In my honest opinion I do not like using guides from professional players, because these are players whose champion pools have to have variety and are not so focused on one particular champion. As an example of someone whose singed build I find to be poor I would pick shy(spellvamp sucks on singed and you will have a hard time swaying my opinion), he is a great player which is why he does well with singed but he just doesn't get the full effectiveness of the champion. I would much rather read a guide from a high elo stomper who only plays the champion he/she is doing a guide on, because they know the champion inside and out.

Most singed players get influenced by builds, and luckily enough singed players have two of the best guides you can have for a league of legends player. These two being:

Inverted composers guide: http://www.solomid.net/guides.php?g=19669-invertedcomposer-singed-build-guide

Rankalees guide: http://www.solomid.net/guides.php?g=43122-lamiegendsmurf-singed-build-guide

These are the absolute best singed guides to look through, I mostly use Ranka Lees guide (which deserved more attention) because it fits my playstyle better and we share ideals on how singed should be played. The inverted one is very good aswell and is probably the one you all know about.

EDIT 2: I see people are looking at singed passive and thinking they have to abuse the most out of it as they can, but to be honest the passive isn't amazing and buying mana for health is a poor investment especially because singed won't use the ridiculous amount of mana both items give. 

Singed players get tear or catalyst because they NEED it not because it synergizes with singed passive, stop delaying core duelling items for singed for pointless stats.

Also catalyst does synergize well with singed, but it got nerfed recently and tear is pretty op so that is the reason I think tear is more effective as of now.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1366021504.0,,,True,t3_1cbr93,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1cbr93/why_do_people_rush_both_catalyst_and_tear_for/,

Can we compare bloodthirster to hydra for a second?

**BT:**

70-100 AD
12-18% ls

3200 gold

Builds from BF sword and vamp sceptar


**Hydra:** 
75 ad
15 hp regen
12% lifesteal

3000 gold

Passive	
Melee only 

PASSIVE: Damage dealt by this item benefits from life steal. 


UNIQUE PASSIVE - CLEAVE: Your attacks deal up to 60% of your Attack Damage to units around your target as physical damage, decaying down to 20% near the edge.
Active


UNIQUE ACTIVE - CRESCENT: Deals up to 100% of your Attack Damage to units around you as physical damage, decaying down to 60% near the edge. (10 second cooldown)

Builds out of tiamat and vamp sceptar.


Now I've recently started to build hydra on zed in situations where I would usually build bt. It has 25 less AD and less single target lifesteal (comparable overall with the splash - but i can only approximate) but the active and passive more than make up for it in my opinion. The build path is also much smoother (smaller increments in gold needed to upgrade - no 1550 chunk of gold needed for bf). It's also 200 gold cheaper.

What do you personally like? If you go BT instead of Hydra, why? Even talon, who does not AA alot, gets a lot from the active ability. 1:1 ad scaling in an aoe is pretty damn huge to anyone whose building ad and armor pen. **I just don't see enough merits on BT to warrant buying it on ad assassins. It costs more money and it seems like it would be less damage.** 

(small hydra bonus - when paired with bc you now have aoe armor shred. probably more useful on a bruiser who buys 2 damage/3 tank items like renekton or something but thought id point out the cool synergy of these items).

This is very effective against teams that do the older Top Bot swap, as it appears to not only shut down the AP Carry should they not match the duo mid, but also they trade a top or bot for mid tower, securing much more map control, while still maintaining dragon pressure and adc safety.

I run AttSpe Red, Armor Yellow, MR/lvl Blue and AP Quin and 21-0-9 Masteries. 

Starting Machete 5 pots and W you can clear without ever getting low on hp.


What really got me excited was when I realized how much sustain she gets after you pick up Spectral Wraith. (Every ability heals you some but her reset ult plus short cooldown smite gives you very high sustain)


Most of the popular jungle champs currently wouldn't fair well in a 1v1 against her either because of the shield and passive additional damage every 3 strikes.


Builds would vary depending on your team comp but Spectral Wraith item would be a must. I find the Seeker's Armguards give you a nice item to hold onto until you get a chunk of cash from some successful ganks. A lot of times I will go RoA if my team needs me to have a bit of beef. (This item is also a good choice if you might/have to give up your blue for any reason)


Late game Diana gives you another bruiser style AP. I would expect her to work best with a dive comp although her Q also gives way for a pretty solid poke too.


What do you guys think? I know she is used sometimes but what makes her not a top jungle? I haven't had a lot of time to test her but I don't see any glaring weakness.

This Eve has no sustain, she has terrible starting stats for defense, attack speed, damage. There is no way to sustain her in the jungle without lots of potions or just building wriggles which seems to be popular jungle build anyway. Her range of vision on which she can be seen has a larger radius than I think is appropriate, it gives plenty of warning time to anyone you are trying to gank, unless you flash which I have been running without fail on her all the time. Besides the flash I have been running exhaust to help with ganks but am thinking about running heal because I have realized the greatest value that an Eve can provide on a team is bait. Straight up sacrificial bait for the good of the team. Last game I supported bot, got a philo stone, movement boots, roamed a bit. Then went for guardian angel. Then started building Trinity Force, starting with zeal. I ended up baiting a fed xin into a bad dive at the tower in a 2v1 and spent most of the time either helping pop ult in teamfights or using W to speed around the map keeping the creeps off of our towers and pushing enemy towers while the rest of the team was putting pressure elsewhere, using E on minions to speed up the process. This I think was perfectly suited to her current kit. Realistically speaking her ratios are garbage, and Eve cannot be the damage on the team. She is the tanky bait that cleans up creep lanes late game and keeps other lanes on their toes the rest of the time. She doesn't jungle particularly well without basically making her ad and it seems like a waste as she usually gets focused as soon as she is out of stealth, reducing the amount of seconds for a dps build and therefore her total damage output.

I don't doubt that this will spread down to solo queue, as it's not really one of those strategies that really requires teamwork, it's just one of those things that changes the way a team fight works. The thing is though, I don't see very many changes they could do to the item to make it a little more interesting. An often mentioned change would be to make the reset longer, but all that would do is have teams wait/play defensive even longer.

1) GLOBALS:  Everyone on your team must have a global-scale ultimate, preferably something that can be used offensively.  Skillshots are a plus.  We ran ashe/lux bot, ziggs mid, pirate jungle, ezreal top.  Every time your ults are up you choose a lane to pick on, throw everything at it, and see what sticks.

Won lanes really hard, but had a terrible transition to team fights on account of lacking a real front line.  Probably should have played it out as a pure poke/disengage comp, but we kept getting nailed by morg bindings or mummy bandages and that made team fights very rough.  Result: Loss.

You can capitalize on the fact that in some games most damage from the early game bottom lane is physical and tristana has ridiculous AP ratios on her moves that you level early game.

.8 on jump
1.0 on explosive shot
1.5 on bustershot


Add in the improved ignite mastery and it increases your lvl 2, 5, and 6 burst pretty substantially: adds 29 magic dmg at lvls 2 and 5, adds 53 dmg to lvl 6 burst.

You also dont sacrifice anything in terms of laning phase AD Carry damage potential(last hitting, auto-poking), and it lets you have a better chance of an early snowball.

The only downside is the lack of early MR, which can HOPEFULLY be made up for in the fact that you can pretty much insta-kill most enemy carries at lvl 2 with the right support(Blitzcrank, Leona, ect), if you are able to land 1 or 2 auto attacks before you unleash the burst. Also her jump resets on kill so its still SOMEWHAT safe, if you're careful. You can then use the gold gain to get an early null-magic mantle to offset the lack of rune MR if you're feeling vulnerable.


Again ONLY risk this build if they have an AD-centric damage bottom lane combo.

Last hitting is important, everyone knows that. But if you aren't a pro and you dont play 8 hours a day, its somewhat more difficult to get the timing correct for a specific champion's autoattack-- along with damage, range, etc. 

So basically, I make a custom game with 1 bot (usually Sivir because she pushes pretty hard and will harass you when you have no minions) and choose the champions I want to focus on to last hit better. 

-For 10 minutes I last hit as much as possible (I *should* be getting perfect ~100 but I never do). Ive done this many times (*I originally devised this as a way to check my ping before playing an actual game) and this has helped me sooo much with last hitting because I know when to use my abilities, which minions I can reach and so forth.

-And if you really want to get hardcore about it, you should review the replay to see in which kind of situations are you not getting those last hits in and try to adjust.

I dont know how obvious this is to people but no one I know does this (or everyone is being quiet about it).

______

You might think, oh this doesnt consider so many factors like junglers, how aggressive the enemy player is, and what kind of champions the enemy player in a real game would be playing. Well theres no way to supplement real players with bots however, despite all that, this kind of practice is still extremely beneficial because you get to understand every aspect of your champion better in a lane-like situation. You start to figure out in which windows you can get aggressive w/o sacrificing last hits, which last hits are safe, etc. Because the laning phase revolves almost completely around the passive art of last hitting, this kind of practice will help in ways you will understand once you try it.",,False,,t5_2smhl,True,,,True,t3_s6xbm,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/s6xbm/a_simple_way_to_get_betterbut_just_a_warning_this/,

So basically, since the camps are becoming easier to clear, with the small camps giving some minor heals, this is the proposed setup. 2 bot, 2 top, AP mid. Top and bottom both will consist of one ""roaming"" champion, and one champion with enough sustain to handle 1v2 for short periods of time (It may be possible Cloth Armor+5 Health Pots will be enough).

What the roaming champions will do is clear their respective side of the jungle. Whoever is on the side with Golem Buff, their roamer will be one who excels with the usage of that buff, eg. Alistar, or Fiddlesticks.

On the side with Lizard Buff, there will be a champion who excels at melee slowing, for example Xin Zhao, or Udyr, or Nocturne who will also act as a bruiser. From Stonewall008's videos, it seems that the respawn on the small camps is short enough that it can provide a fair source of income throughout laning phase (and even beyond), so the champions on the red side will also act as bruisers later on in the game.

Middle will be AP, possibly someone with high mobility or good ganking power, for example Kassadin, Gragas or Sion.

So what happens is that everyone goes to their specific side of the jungle - the roamers will clear their sides while the solo-ers will play defensively for the first minute or so while the jungle is being cleared. Then, the roamers can choose to gank their respective lanes, or middle, or even choose to converge on middle for a three-man gank. 

After the ganks (successful or not), the roamers should either return to lane to help support (and cs) the solo-er, or buy. When the jungle respawns again, they will go and clear it, and resume ganking.

Another possibility is a dedicated counter-jungler, one who goes in and takes the large minions in each of the small camps, and excels at 1v1 fights, like Trundle.

*Shard of True Ice; 

*Twin Shadows; 

*Will of the Ancients.


This item will pay for itself after 32 minutes, or if sold, in 16 minutes.

 
That was some lolwiki information, now let's discuss when it should be bought and what upgrade is the best. I always buy this item for supports and usually upgrade it in twin shadows because of ms and ot allows me play more aggressive. But SoTI continues generate gold and gives your allies manareg+nice active, specially if you have nice diver like j4. Morellonomicon is great for supports as well. A lot of supports benefit from ap, manareg and cdr. also it applies heal reducing and if you have a lot aoe damage you can apply it on an entire team. So all this items are good, but which one is the best for supports? Yeah, I know it is situational. So let's discuss that ""situations"".


Also KLP can be useful on ap carries. TS, Morello and WotA are good upgrades for apc. I usually build TS on Fizz, it allows you to catch people and also gives you additional mobility which is very cool for Fizz. Morello is great for champions with aoe spells. I started to build it for Ahri and Lux few days ago instead of Athene's if I don't need a lot of mr (facing ad mid or enemy ap isn't fed at all\doesn't focus me). Morello and Grail gives you pretty similar stats. Also Morello costs 400g cheaper and builds from KLP and if you catch up KLP early you can gain some extra profit. WotA is great for champions like morde or vladimir but I don't play them much so nothing I can say about it.

1359488327.0,23,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,17igi3,Jayce II: This Time It's Mid Lane,GANGBANGARANG,29,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/17igi3/jayce_ii_this_time_its_mid_lane/,"Jayce was an extremely popular champ in the tournament scene after his release due to his insane midgame strength, incredible poke, and lane bully ability. After Riot nerfed him with his own hammer, and compounded by the neutering of Phage, he fell into obscurity. Season 3 seemed to be the final nail in his coffin with health-stacking all the rage and sustain4days crippling the advantage of his lane presence. Could this be the end of our hero?

Well, like every other top laner that can't cut it on their old stomping grounds, Jayce makes for a strong fit in mid. He duels well, pokes well, pushes well, roams well, and brings Bullshit Gate to the table after all.

You want: AD reds, Armor yellows, MR (or cdr vs heavy physical comps) blues, and AD, Arpen, or MS quints. 21/0/9 or 21/9/0 vs scary burst.

Q &gt; W &gt; R &gt; E (Do this if you practically never use hammer form to harass)  
R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E (If you like the hammer switch &gt; Q &gt; AA &gt; E poke/disengage)  
Q &gt; E &gt; R &gt; W (Purely for accelerated Q, not recommended but some games you just aren't gonna be able to do much else)

Reason being is that leveling R gets you no benefits in ranged form besides slightly higher resistance shred which is useless early. Mostly you're getting burst and durability in melee form.

Flash mandatory ofc, ignite always strong, or if you just want to farm at range, Ghost or TP gives you more maneuverability and utility.

Items: 

Start:  
Sword/2 or boots/3 vs melee that you want to harass  
Flask/1/ward vs more balanced lanes  
9pot/2ward vs bullies and scary jungles  

Core:   
Tear &gt; Brutalizer &gt; Manamune  
You want to spam your accelerated shock blast as often as you can for as long as you can to pressure the enemy, push the lane, check bushes, and steal neutrals. Tear &gt; Manamune right now is extremely cost effective on anyone who can charge it quickly, proc the toggle often, and use the mana to its fullest. Brutalizer is sort of a no-brainer on Jayce when it comes to his poke and upgrades into BC or Ghostblade much later. Muramana synergizes with your W  and adds a lot to your sustained ranged damage and burst melee combo alike.

Alternatives: Doran's Blade x1-2, good for a little chunk of health, AD, and very strong lane sustain  
Vamp or BF sword instead of that Brutalizer if you want a faster BT  
Hexdrinker vs LB, Kass, etc.  

Boots:  
CDR 90% of the time  
Swiftness, Merc, and Tabi are acceptable if they have a lot of 1 damage type (or Really Sticky Goo)  
Furor &gt; Alacrity &gt; Distortion IMO, and of course	Homeguard if the action's happening around your base.

Everything else:  
BT - best investment for raw damage and lifesteal, good for duels and PvE pushing. Get this immediately or not at all.  
Upgrade Brut into BC for midgame if you have lots of physical damage and no better way to apply it (Wu, Garen, MF). Otherwise just leave it as brut til lategame and make Ghostblade for selfish damage or BC for team.  
Shiv - If you're poking a lot with your W this is a great way to get damage in and improve your sustained auto dps instead of poke. Combine with BT for best results.  
Iceborn Gauntlet - excellent if you can make use of the armor. Still good if you can't. Extra push/waveclear, ungodly kiting, beautiful cdr (will cap you with cdr boots + brut), synergizes with Muramana, guaranteed slow on the first hit makes landing a full w so much easier.  
Warmog's - Your pokes aren't doing much but you're too squishy to throw down in fights? Mog is your friend.  
LW - After Muramana/Brut/BT this is where you go to improve your poke damage. I wouldn't bother in most cases.  
Triforce - Iceborn's ugly older brother. No guaranteed slow, zeal stats you don't really need, but still great and facing a tentative price buff. Get it if you crave pure offensive power and dueling.  
IE - So you have BT, Shiv, and Triforce but still you hunger for huge crits and facemelting. Get IE and watch your Ws hit like Ike Turner.  
Atma - if you got Warmogs and want more armor, it's not a bad pickup.  
Maw - if you need MR.  
GA - 2 Ryze from ur Graves.

The gameplay is quite simple. Poke hard, use your range to cs passively vs aggressive jungles and lanes. Your W hits fucking hard from rank 3 on, and doubly so with Muramana. Use your midgame strength to shove lane, roam, push towers (dat w), force objectives, and generally fuck shit up from out of range. Steal buffs. Ward their wraiths and last hit em with Q. Just fucking ward excessively, you're shit if you get caught so stay guerilla 4 life. Use form switching to charge tear when running anywhere or farming solo. Use your mana regen in melee + tear + flask to spam without a care in the world.

Specifically, Jayce does well vs health stacking bruisers with his consistent poke, kiting, and disengage. He does well vs squishy APs in lane because he balls so hard with shock blast. He can handle mobile assassins by exploiting his range. Jayce is crazy versatile and deserves a second look from those who thought him dead in the water.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_17igi3,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/17igi3/jayce_ii_this_time_its_mid_lane/,
1359166483.0,22,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,17alhu,Let's talk about Ashe.,spirited1,27,5,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/17alhu/lets_talk_about_ashe/,"First of all, Ashe is definitely one of my favorite champions. This is mainly due to the fact that she was my first and I have roflstomped many players in my early days of LoL with her. However, at higher levels of play this all changes. I find her kit to be a little more than outdated. She's a slow, non-mobile adc in a meta that has become filled with assassins and bruisers looking to hunt down the adc. While the adc is intended to be targeted by these bruisers and assassins, Ashe is at a noticeably large disadvantage to countering these playstyles. While Ezreal has his blink, MF has her speed boost passive, and even Sivir having a spellshield and speedboost, Ashe is left defenseless with a short skillshot stun and 35% slow to try to protect herself.

Let's talk about her kit:  
[Passive] - Focus: Ashe's critical strike chance increases by 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 / 18% every 3 seconds while not attacking. Focus' bonus is expended with her next basic attack.  

[Q] - Frostshot: TOGGLE: Ashe's basic attacks slow her targets for 2 seconds. (15%/20%/25%/30%/35%)  

[W] - Volley: ACTIVE: Ashe fires 7 arrows in a cone, dealing physical damage to each target hit. Each arrow will only hit one enemy, and each enemy will only be hit by one arrow. Volley also applies the current rank of Frost Shot, regardless if it is toggled on or not. 

[E] - Hawkshot: PASSIVE: Ashe gains bonus gold whenever she kills a unit or destroys a structure.
BONUS GOLD: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5
ACTIVE: Ashe animates a hawk to scout for her, revealing terrain for 2 seconds as it flies towards a target location. Hawkshot reveals a wide area for 5 seconds when it reaches its destination. The hawk will reveal units in the brushes, but will not reveal stealthed units or objects.

[R] - Enchanted Crystal Arrow: ACTIVE: Ashe fires a large arrow in a straight line. If it hits an enemy champion, it will deal magic damage and stun that champion for up to 3.5 seconds based on the distance the arrow traveled. Additionally, surrounding units take half the damage and are slowed by 50% for 3 seconds.

Looking at her kit, you can tell she is heavily reliant on AA. However, this has no synergy with her passive. Her passive stacks up over time when she is *not* attacking. This is ridiculous for an adc who will be farming lane. She can not, in any efficient way use her passive. The only time her passive will be of use is a level one cheese play or after returning to lane from shop. When team fights begin to happen, she's not going to sit around charging her passive. As an alternative, her passive could charge on AA. They could go a Tryndamere like path where each shot charges up her chances of getting a critical strike, or perhaps a Caitlin like approach where after  certain amount of shots she has an elevated chance to crit or a 100% chance to crit.

Her Q, Frost Shot, smacks her passive in the face even more. When toggled, Ashe's arrows will apply a small slow for 2 seconds. While this is effective at kiting, a lot of champions now have gap closers or some kind of CC. It is also barely noticeable until she ranks it up more. During teamfights it's relevance is increased, allowing the team to catch a straggler or slowing down the enemy bruiser before they can reach her. However, this may force Ashe to leave the fight (which is an effective, viable counter if Ashe becomes a nuisance). A possible way to enhance this ability would be to allow Ashe to have a slight MS boost while toggled (draining mana constantly, and having no mana cost for each individual shot however) would allow the slow to be more effective for kiting and allowing a bit more mobility in her kit while also causing her to watch her mana and use it effectively.

Ashe's E is what bothers me the most. While it can be incredibly useful at times, it is useless most of the time. A 60 second cooldown at all levels, it will almost never be up when you need it. The passive is useless until you rank it up even more, by which point you will most likely not be farming anymore, you decided to max it first to maximize farming, or somehow have exactly equal farm to the enemy adc and manage to buy a BF sword first. Even worse, it also has no synergy with her passive. Each shot gives her gold, so why should she wait for her passive instead of farming? I know this ability was reworked many times, but honestly it's really bad. Perhaps the cool down could be shortened as it is ranked higher so it's relevance late game would be increased, or allow her to have a small attack speed steroid on critical hits (removing E passive though) or when her E passive is procced.

Her R, IMO, is very strong, and I consider it one of the best ults in the game when used properly. It can be used as an engage, to snipe a low health enemy, or if you're really skilled, to save another lane across the map (so satisfying to hear ""Nice shot Ashe"" :D). I feel her R is very good on her, but this is no reason to leave the rest of her kit in bad shape.

What are your opinions on Ashe?

Disclaimer: All of my ideas should be taken with a grain of salt. Please consider my opinion thoughtfully and offer your ideas if you disagree, not simply ""Stop whining"". I legitimately feel Ashe has been forgotten, and while I understand that she is a very easy champ to play, she should still be considered for an upgrade.

I have no idea for the rationale behind this since the Doran's starts happened under many different circumstances.  The teams covered practically every combination of laneswaps, aggressive/sustain supports, and lane-dominance/farming ads. And while some combinations could be justified (e.g. Cait-Nunu in a laneswap) others seemed outright bizarre (e.g. Kog-Nunu vs. MF-Sona, both with Doran's).

Anyone have any input?

~

Edit: Okay so after reading through these first comments, starting Doran's makes sense to me in terms of a laneswap, since after the first 1-2 minion waves the duo lane is constantly pushing.  The ADC would quickly rack up those 44 autoattacks to break even in sustain.  Still doesn't make sense as to why people would bring Doran's first into a 2v2.  In my mind, the side that sided Doran's would ideally just get traded down quickly at which point they couldn't autoattack safely to regen health.  And that scenario doesn't seem too infeasible either. So why did they go Doran's in a 2v2?",,False,,t5_2smhl,1358807044.0,,,True,t3_1707hm,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1707hm/dorans_blade_start/,

1357559750.0,22,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1646wf,Starting Red Elixir on Riven,Vaethin,29,7,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1646wf/starting_red_elixir_on_riven/,"So, this is something I've been doign recently and the more I do it the more I like it.

Let's take a look at the *possible starting items*: 

**Boots + 3/4Pots**  - not viable in my opinion, not since the boots nerf. 

**Flask + Pots + Ward(s)** - not viable because Riven doesn't use mana.

**Only Pots and Wards** - Pretty good but the fact that Riven plays very aggressive early and one of the laners will probably go back very soon makes the huge amount of potions overkill.

**Longsword +2x potion**: Makes you very prone to ganks because you have neither boots nor wards. Does however have the fastest development into lategame (longsword builds into Brutalizer or Vamp Scepter).

**Armor + 5 Pots** - pretty much the 2nd best option, but if you want to get a ward to be able to play aggressive early game, then you'll be able to get only 2 health potions which leaves you with very little sustain in lane to recover from early trades (and Riven usually has a million of these).

**So, my suggestion: Red Elixir + 4x Health Potion + 1x Ward.**

**When to do this**: Against strong laners that outlane you early like Olaf or Darius. With the additional mojo from Red Elixir you'll be able to outtrade them early. What this does is take their strongest feature away: Standing in the creeps and harassing you, every time you go for a lasthit. So even though they counter you, you can farm and possibly snowball them. 

**Disadvantages**: Only that you waste your initial 475g all on consumables. On your first trip back you should be able to get Boots + 1x doran's anyways (350+475g=825g). 

How does this *compare to other starts*? 

* **Boots**: It's worse, really. With boots you would have to get only 585g for Doran's+Ward+Potion. With an additional 400 you could even buy another Long sword, giving you a lot of item advantage over the enemy laner, but all that is just theorycrafting because most of the time you'll get crushed if you go boots these days (most people go armor)

* **Armor**: Almost the same sustain but a lot less sustain if you go for a ward. Also armor doesnt really build into anything but armor boots so even though you spent 300g in items those are not really building into your core items yet.

* **Longsword** : Slightly stronger trading, with the red elixir, a lot more sustain (especially if you go for wraiths/wolves on lvl 1) but against weak opponents the additional damage will let you snowball a lot harder. Might be the best choice when they have a jungler that starts red, you have a jungler who starts red while you're on red team and you're thus unable to do one of the little camps for early Level 2.

Anyways, enough of my rambling: What does Reddit think?

1355856233.0,23,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,152ak8,"Galio, why is he so rare?",RedAngel32,29,6,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/152ak8/galio_why_is_he_so_rare/,"Howdy summoners, 1300 elo player here with a question he can't answer: why do so few play Galio?


So there I was, browsing lolkings chart and noticing a certain trend: a lot of people play AP burst type mids, and usually those that like to roam. In my 2 weeks I've fought mostly Kat, Teemo (oh gawd Bulwark), Nidalee and (surprisingly) Veigar. None of which seemed to stand any chance. With Kat I could just eat her burst with my shield then land an easy QE combo and almost always come out on top. I can also zone her with my Q and E and if she ever tries to roam I can have her tower in no time (sometimes it doesn't matter if she's roaming or unloading on me, I've had times where we were almost even in farm and I just sat through her full combo with ~2/3 hp left and kept taking tower). With Teemo, obviously, I can just max W second and his attacks/shrooms will only heal me. With Nid I can usually just push and if I take a damage I can have a stroll to the nearest bush, step on her traps and heal up (and if she doesn't trap I can have the jungler gank with better chances). And finally, Veigar is so squishy early that landing a Q or two puts him in a place where he can't stop me and his combo is almost worthless against my tankiness. In the end, it seems like no one can stop me from taking the tower and any roaming from the enemy will almost invariably result in their tower going down before they get back.


Along with good lane match ups against popular champs (and pretty much any AP outside them) Galio is almost ungankably tanky. If I have a ward in the river and stick to that side there are few ganks I can't brush off or simply avoid with my speed boost/slow.


Finally, there's the team fight potential. Obviously Galio's ult is devastating in team fights, a 2 second stun to up to 5 of them enemy team AND a shit ton of aoe damage means a lot in a team fight. Plus if the enemy tries to break up so I can't ult them it usually just ends up in them either being to split to fight effectively or me shoving the ADC away/into my ult since his team doesn't want to get near me for the peel. Along with this he brings 2 slows or a speed buff (great for initiating and a slow that also deal a good bit of damage, which are always good in a team fight. And finally he packs a massive shield (90 armor and magres for 4 seconds!) which basically means either your initiator will take heavily mitigated damage from the enemy try to burst him down or your ADC/APC (depending) won't have to worry about harass nearly as much. It also keeps you up on HP no matter who you place it on which means you can stay in the fight and keep tanking/dealing damage/applying CC for your team.


So I'm wondering, why does no one play Galio? Does he take too much issue with the new rise of AD casters? Is his more bruiser-based focus less needed than another heavy damage dealer? Is he too ugly? What's the dilly?


EDIT: After reading the comments it looks like a lot of people like Galio, and those that don't see issues in his: early game (I haven't, but what ever), the nerfs to MR (runes, items, etc), nerfed AP ratios, difficulty to land Q, issues farming and the rise of AD casters.
1. I honestly haven't had any issue with his early game. Most of the time I can just farm and if the enemy tries to attack they generally put themselves in a place (like their abilities have a cast animation or, like with Kat, they flash onto you) that I can just pop W and launch a Q and E with minimal issues. Other than that there's jungler ganks and mana to worry about, the former of which is usually solved by playing somewhat passive until about lvl 4 and the latter is scarcely even a problem, I tend to just consume the next wave at ~500g and go back for my chalice, pots and a ward. Early game hasn't been an issue for me thus far.
2. I hadn't been playing this game with any degree of seriousness until something like 3 months ago, so I can't really speak for the changes to MR for the most part (save for the loss of FoN and the new Aegis, which seems to be named after Galio, is a great item for him that didn't exist before). 
3. This one does sound like something of an issue, but the nerfed ratios still seem plenty strong enough and the fact that you're probably going to build a lot of tank makes this less important (as long as you have a competent ADC/carry jungle/top).
4. True, Q is often a bitch to land but most of the time it seems like I'm either using it to farm or catch a fleeing enemy in the late game, where trying to dodge such a big (though slow moving) AoE slow tends to just get you in someone else's slow (which was pretty much the purpose of the slow to begin with). And if they're not fleeing late game its either someone chasing you, 1v1ing you or you're in a team fight. If they're chasing you then, again, them dodging the Q would likely have the same end result of a slow on then. If they're 1v1ing you and you can't land your Q, then you should probably leave and if they chase you refer to the previous sentence. And, in a team fight, most won't have time to dodge it/will be too busy with other things to react in time.
5. I don't even know where this one came from, pretty much the moment you get lvl 5 Q you take out the entire wave with 1 QE combo, and pre-that its just like farming with champs like Fizz (which ain't that hard once you get the hang of it) -- made more so if that Fizz went for E first.
6. This is the big one I think. AD casters in all their new glory are quite the opposite of what Galio thrives on, and make him fairly niche.

Over all: I think the issues with lowered MR in general, nerfed AP ratios and the AD casters are the biggest issues, but the fact that you're going pretty Bruiser/CC with a good bit of damage on the side kinda makes the damage issue feel like not such a problem. And, as for MR, there are still a lot of great items (Abys, Runic Bulwark, Athene's, etc) for MR and Galio's great farming seems to make up for their apparent expensiveness. AD casters are still an issue, but if you're last pick and they didn't grab Talon/Panth/the like I'd say Galio is a strong pick for almost any AP mid (the only issue I still see past the ADs are things like Karth because of your desire to farm and his late game power). Feel free to tell me I'm stupid for any part of this, I'd like to learn what ever I can.

As suggested, today I present my cross-posted PSA: How to play Viktor with any of his augments, with example builds and stats.",TheRealJasonBourne,26,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/14tx8r/hello_rlolmeta_as_suggested_today_i_present_my/,"I'm going to start this post by saying that I main Viktor and play him rather obsessively; he was the first champion that I bought.


I see a lot of people lamenting the fact that he only gets to buy 5 items because of his passive, or saying that they think his passive is weak and needs to be redone. I don't think his passive is weak at all, though it could use a couple very slight tweaks, but even as is I think any of his augments are very strong.


As promised in the title, I'm going to examine both of his less popular augments and explain how I think you should play each of them to maximize their potential, as well as give an example build for each augment and the stats that build would give.

*******************************************

A couple things to note, before I begin:
All my stats are either from [the preseason items site, hosted by Riot](http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/preseason/items) or from [Viktor's page on the LoL wiki.](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Viktor)

All stats are given for level 18 and not all stats are included, because some just aren't useful to know for the particular build I showcase here.

Finally, I will not discuss Augment: Death, for two reasons:

1. Everyone who plays Viktor (other than me) plays with it, so I assume everyone knows how to play it.

2. Even if you don't play Viktor, you build Augment: Death as a pretty standard AP glass cannon, and I really shouldn't have to explain how to do that.

********************************

So, we'll start with the least popular augment:

**Augment: Power --**

I've never seen a good thing said about this augment. I understand this point of view: it's making a burst mage into a tank, what the hell is with that? Burst mages shouldn't build health items, because that just goes against their playstyle.

Not with Viktor: you can build, especially with a couple new S3 items, what I call Hit-and-Run Viktor, which is hilarious and totally viable.

*Example Build:*

1. Augment: Power

2. Sorcerer's Shoes with the Furor enchantment (get the enchantment as soon as you can)

3. Liandry's Torment

4. Rylai's Crystal Scepter

5. Rabadon's Deathcap

6. Void Staff

*Stats:*

* HP: 2709

* Health Regen: 24.45 per 5

* Mana: 1140

* Mana Regen: 15 per 5

* MS: 380 (may be 390 with the S3 buffs, I don't recall exactly)

     * This is increased by 30% for 3 seconds upon casting Power Transfer (due to Augment: Power) and a further 12% that degrades over 3 seconds once PT hits its target (from Furor enchantment).

     * These two buffs briefly give Viktor 501 MS (that's the max before the Furor buff starts degrading)

* AP: 492.5

* mPen: 40% + 30 flat

**Playstyle:**

As I've previously mentioned, I call this ""Hit-and-Run Viktor,"" and I think you'll quickly see why.

This build focuses on kiting and burst damage with a q that hits like a train, making up for the lower AP (compared to a full glass cannon) with a ton of Magic Penetration.

*In lane:*

Max Power Transfer (q) first and Death Ray (e) second. Stay back and farm, occasionally poking with your e to keep your opponent off of you until you get your augment (this should be around level 4 or 5 if you're getting every minion).

As soon as you have the gold, go back and get A:P. Now the fun can begin! Either:

1. Wait for you opponent to come forward to engage you. As soon as they do, target them with PT and wait for it to launch; immediately after casting PT, start running away from them. Since the MS buff from A:P activates upon casting PT, this means that you'll be moving away surprisingly fast, and your opponent will probably miss their retaliation. If they don't, the shield will almost certainly block what little they do manage to get off.

2. Slowly get closer and closer to your opponent while farming, shutting them out with your e. Once they get desperate to kill those minions, punish them with a q to the face and run away laughing.

Once you've gotten your boots and the Furor enchantment this gets even more fun, because then you have, in total, a 42% MS boost. ZOOOOOOOOOOOM!

Now say you want a kill. You can either:

1. Go as before, except run toward your opponent once PT is cast, then w&gt;e&gt;r&gt;ignite&gt;q&gt;AA for the kill if necessary.

2. Let your opponent push a little past the halfway mark, then q a minion and dive them. Then w&gt;e&gt;r (right as the stun wears off, that way you get all the utility out of the silence)&gt;ignite&gt;q again.

*Alright, done with laning. Now what?*

In teamfights, kite like a madman. You already have been, and now it just amps up. Harass with your q, making them burn spells trying to catch you.

If you want to initiate, walk up, q&gt;w&gt;e while running away&gt;r once your team is on top of them&gt;chase down fleeing people with q&gt;w&gt;e combo (q minions if you have to).

If you don't initiate then walk up, w&gt;everything else.

**TL;DR for A:P --** Build items that give HP &amp; AP, get the Furor enchantment on your boots, kite like a madman and annoy the hell out of any opponent that tries to catch you.

**************

**Augment: Gravity --**

This augment is more support-oriented, which makes it less popular with more aggressive players; however, despite the lack of offensive stats, it really lends itself to controlling your lane and screwing up teamfights for the enemy.

*Example Build:*

1. Augment: Gravity

**Playstyle:**

This is the long-range utility/harass/support Viktor. As you may notice, this build has a little less AP than HaRV does, but it makes up for this by being able to cast spells more often and being able to do so out of most other champions' retaliation ranges.

*In lane:*

Max your e first (I assume you're good enough to hit it 75% or more of the time, because that's about how often I hit it), q second, ult when possible, and w last.

Stay back and poke with your e at its max range. Most people are REALLY bad at dodging it, which is funny because it's a line skillshot and it doesn't even go that fast.

Once you have enough gold to (again, at level 4 or 5), push your lane and then go back to get Augment: Gravity. Now you have the supreme advantage of range.

If you want a kill or two, now is the time to get them, because everyone underestimates the enhanced range of your w (30% doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that it more than covers an entire lane side-to-side and allows for control of an entire collapsed creep wave). Here's how you do that:

1. Walk back to lane and farm like usual until level 6, but don't use your grav well unless you really have to. Poke them down a little with your e. If you get them to about 60% HP you're golden.

2. Then, for your kill, get so that your lane opponent is just within your w's range, and drop it on them, ideally so that they're centered in it: unless they flash, they'll be stunned. Then, e while walking up&gt;q&gt;r immediately after GW's stun wears off&gt;ignite&gt;e/q/AA for the kill, chasing a little if you have to.

After you kill them a couple times they'll realize that they need to stay the fuck back, and one of two things will happen:

1. They'll stay the fuck back. Make sure they do by keeping them off creeps with the hilarious zone control of your w and e. Obviously keep the river warded so that you know when someone's coming to gank you, and trap them with the Gravity Well when they try (if you're really good/fed, you can actually turn ganks in your favor by dropping your w right on them and ulting both of those suckers, then cleaning up with q&gt;e&gt;ignite&gt;chase them with ult).

2. They'll call for their jungler to camp the lane. This is a bit more problematic because you'll burn through mana like nothing else trying to hold a 2v1 lane, so get blue buff, Athene's, and Archangel's ASAP. This'll fix your mana issues and give you the ability to keep them at bay indefinitely with your zone control. Don't expect to get kills in this situation unless you're already stupidly fed (if you already have A:G, boots 2, and Athene's and/or Archangel's by the time the jungler starts camping you're probably gonna be fine).

*Alright, we're done with laning. Now what?*

Now you stay at the back of your team. The huge range on your e and w make it so that you can assist from at the back, and it keeps you from getting dived quite as easily by the enemy team.

If you want to initiate, find someone who walks too far away from their teammates and trap them with the gravity well: this should help your team get at least that kill, burn that person's flash, or force the enemy team into a teamfight in which they're now disadvantaged.

For any other initiation, drop your w right into the enemy team and unload everything.

**TL;DR for Augment: Gravity --** You have all of the range, all of the mana, and still hit pretty damn hard. Zone those suckers out!

**************

Now I did say that I think his passive could use a little tweaking, and here's I think on that:

A:D makes Viktor a glass cannon, so I think the AP/level bonus should be a little higher to go with this. 7 AP/lvl would make A:D yield 171 AP@18 vs 108 AP@18 currently.

A:G makes Viktor more support-oriented, and it's already pretty good IMO. I think the only change should be making it decrease GW's cast time by 50% in addition to everything else.

A:P makes Viktor tankier and harassment-focused. To make it synergize better with this style, it should replace the shield on his q with innate spell vamp at 10/15/20/25/30% per level of q. As a trade, his q would be unable to gain further SV.

It should also give 5AP/lvl instead of 3 (90 vs 54 AP @18).

The item in question is Rylai's Crystal Scepter. Asides from it's inherent lack of mana, it does suit Ryze's kit quite neatly. His Q and W with both apply the 35% slow on a relatively low cooldown, and his ult will allow him to provide a mass slow, which will serve to add to his utility in teamfights. The HP suits the tanky aspect of the rest of Ryze's build, and as far as I can see, the only real drawback is the limited impact building so much AP will have for such a high cost with his low ratios. That being said, while his ratios aren't fantastic, they aren't abysmal - his Q and W have 40% and 60% AP ratios respectively ([Link to his LoLwiki page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ryze).)

I remember seeing some pro's follow that flat magic pen build with Abyssal Scepter and Haunting Guise because they work so well with the MR reduction of his E, so perhaps building AP on him isn't as bad as I used to believe.

Either way I'm interested in hearing some opinions, and I'd be thankful if you gave me your insight.

I believe strongly that there are many other viable picks that don't see much play due to requiring a different approach and stricter team comps based around compensating for their weaknesses and synergizing with their strengths. Let's talk about these champs, their combos, and what they bring to the table.

Pantheon and Shaco: Two ad assassins with lots of early pressure, mobility, and hard cc. Both of them thrive in the 3's environment since they have more flexibility to build offensively with less damage going around and an easier time isolating priority targets. Snowballing the lane phase is critical for these two but they keep the pressure on going into lategame as well. Generally you want a team that can build off their burst to quickly melt a target and then play keep-away, using their mobility and cc to keep your low-health teammates safe and then cycling out if they get focused.

Ryze and Vlad: Two tanky casters with little earlygame presence that become unstoppable if you can reach certain gold milestones in good time. They have strong sustain, aoe, and waveclear once midgame rolls around and use their range to stay slippery in fights while outputting tremendous sustained damage. CDR capping is a priority making bft and sweeper good pickups. To compensate for their earlygame, it's wise to have a bot lane that can hold their own and mobility to assist when needed. Freezing the lane and farming is the best way to start snowballing until Vlad hits 7 and Ryze has his first chunk of cdr. I generally find myself rushing roa on ryze into bft since tear is awkwardly priced and he needs the mana, but new tear is going to be a tremendous boost to the speed he can start holding his own.

Hecarim and WW: Tanky, high sustain, mixed damage dealers with game-changing ultimates and huge teamfight presence. FH is a natural pickup on both of them and they have plenty of options for resistance itemization whether they build offensively or defensively. A combo like Ori + Hec is downright devastating, while WW does work with teammates that can use his attack speed buff to its fullest extent--pair him up with Irelia or an adc and watch the hp bars melt.

I've noticed a trend in my recent games, and have even seen it a little bit in competitive play, so I want your thoughts on it.
I've been seeing a lot of non-standard supports, especially AP carries.

Today for example, I carried as AD running a Graves-LeBlanc kill-lane. 

More commonly however, I see lux support, Morgana support, fiddlesticks support (though that tends to suck) I've both played and watch pros play Zyra support, and occasionally, if he's not banned, some people will go Malphite support.

On the flip side, I've been trying to play janna and soraka, and to be honest, mid/late game, playing either of these champions feels miserable. I don't care if they're still good or not, by late game, playing as either of those two champions, I feel worthless. They were my go to picks against sona, as the heals and shields used to counter sona pretty well. now, by the time we're a few levels in, it feels like Janna shield can be poped by a single auto attack, and even soraka, the former queen of sustain lanes, seems to get worn down or CC'ed and blown up way too easily.

_________________________________________________________________________

What worries me, is that Riot seems to be balancing bot lane around soraka and janna (see recent sona nerfs) rather than going back and giving them some of their former glory back or re-designing them. I'm also worried that we aren't going to see any decent support champions come out, as they're going to have to be incredibly weak to be balanced against the current supports (Less HP and armor at lvl 1 than a melee minion? really?). Mids on the other hand, have bearable defensive stats to let them trade in mid lane, and most have good CC that works well throughout the entire game, regardless of items. (The same reason Taric, Leona, and Alistair still seem to work alright)

As a result I figure I should expect a lot more mid champions move into bot lane. who knows maybe in the near future I'll be playing against an Elise in bot lane. She seems to have some useful support traits, having a stun and revealing nearby enemies can't be bad things.

1351122930.0,20,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,121bgp,Understanding Itemization (and the Katarina debate specifically),pengu1nz,21,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/121bgp/understanding_itemization_and_the_katarina_debate/,"**This post was written as a response to someone else who responded ""Deathcap first Kat is always better, you deal the most damage that way"" and I felt like there needed to be a bigger, seperate post on understanding why guides and pro/high elo players' perspectives somewhat limit peoples' builds and how you have to think about itemization independent from guides so you can understand when to change or do something differently.**

Background - There are two setups for Katarina that are often debated:

* 9/21/0 defensive spec, max W and build magic pen items in conjunction with DFG. W is maxed to roam and MR reduction is built to assassinate bot/top lane enemies that are usually low on MR. Plays more like an AP bruiser in lane with constant trades and cleaning up if required.

* 21/9/0 offensive spec, max Q and go straight deathcap/normal ap carry items like voidstaff, hourglass, etc. Plays cautious, poke oriented mid. DFG is only purchased if lane is 100-0 able.

* TnA is shorthand for [TiensiNoAkuma](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/398435), NA's most famed Katarina player other than Scarra. 

* Why should my opinion on Katarina matter? I've only played ~40 games as Katarina since the rework (I played her like mad in normals before they reworked her as I was never confident enough to avoid CC in ranked games) but in those 40 games I've raised from 1910 rating to my peak now of 2289, mostly because of Kat.

TnA plays kat as a late game team fighting machine, getting as many freebies as possible while maximizing losses. He builds for straight AOE damage in teamfights no matter what and goes more glass cannon. It definitely deals the most damage but it leaves the least margin for error.  He also maxes Q and plays conservatively in midlane whist not pushing that much and taking free camps whenever possible. It's a very high-consistency playstyle; especially when you've gotten the kat mechanics down as well as TnA does. He emphasizes this by avoiding DFG unless he has a lane matchup like Karthus who he knows he can 100/0 with just DFG. The DFG is a core aspect of the other build and avoiding it makes playing her that way kind of pointless.

I and many others play a different Kat that peaks during the midgame, focused on single target nuking to force a singular reset, nuking someone with low MR as fast as possible. 9/21 is taken by many of these players, building mPen items like Abyssal/Haunting to become more of an AP cleanup bruiser. I'd argue that for the majority of players, this build is superior because it has a greater margin of error - if you fuck up your combo you'll still most likely survive. Maxing W in lane faster makes CSing a lot easier and lets you shove to roam faster. The tradeoff for this build, as TnA actually references in his last video, is that you cannot deal nearly as much damage. Your late game is severely delayed and you rely on your snowballed teammates to help you end the game if you don't get enough champion lasthits. 

Neither of these kat builds are ""better""; they're both different niches that you need to actually understand the champion to choose from. Laning against a Karthus who is dominating your sidelanes and it looks like you need to carry late game? Don't go 9-21, go 21-9 with quick DFG -&gt; DCAP. Laning against an Orianna(one of Kat's harder matchups)/double AP top and you're of average skill? Go 9-21 and mPen and go for the roam try, pushing out your lane with W. They're different styles of play suitable for different situations. With enough skill either can be pulled off effectively. 

TL;DR If you don't want to read a wall of text don't read it. Just make sure you build situationally and I cannot emphasize that enough.

Caitlyn and Panth especially went well, I would just destroy the enemy laner with my constant harass and then do other stuff to pull my team ahead.

With Panth I just super snowballed most games with Manamune (don't judge me please &lt;_&lt;) and Brutalizer, ganking and roaming hard and getting fed from bot lane/dragon. 

Seems to me people just can't handle facing a strong AD champ mid, even when they bought Tabis or other armor I would just shred right through it with my Armor Pen Quints and masteries (always went 21 offense for armor pen). Cait seemed a little overpowered from what I played just because of her constant poke and easy escape with net, I rearely took damage and just free harassed.

He's not in the big three and isn't widely used (bottom 1/3), but he has excellent attributes for carrying solo queue games.

I didn't know this until I started playing him, but when you apply blight to the enemy it will stack up to three times. I used to think you had to use three abilities to detonate the stack, but you actually only need to use one. This allows your trades in lane to be extremely powerful, leading with E, autos, and closing with Q and simultaneously moving out of range.

Position yourself to trade immediately after last hitting a minion to receive an attack speed steroid, helping counteract the steroids on the ever popular Ezreal/Graves matchups.

His E provides a healing debuff to cause pain in sustain lanes, notably good against Taric, likely the most popular solo queue support right now.

Blight is extremely useful later in the teamfight stage. Solo queue is known for having bad AD carry peeling in lower elo, which means you need to be able to peel for yourself and survive. Graves/Ezreal/Corki already have this to some degree with their jump. You have this with your E and ultimate. Frankly it doesn't matter if you use your ultimate on one target as long as it's keeping you in the fight. Due to the power of Blight, you're able to easily do quite strong damage to any bruisers leaping on you, and you can poke quite well with blight and Q.

All this said, I'm wondering what sort of things Varus is really susceptible to. While the lack of a jump doesn't outright shut a carry down, it does make it more difficult.

Nocturne is pretty squishy so that HP helps him a lot. He clears camps fast enough without the Wriggles proc except for early dragons.

And no, I don't think Wriggles is a bad item. But it's quite expensive if you don't really need all the stats. If you do, it's a viable choice. I have nothing against a Wriggles if the opponents are heavy physical and you want to secure early dragons.

But if you're ganking or farming I think, Double Dorans is superior especially against Double AP teams. It is less expensive letting you get your HoG + Aegis that much faster.

TL;DR: Wriggles isn't as cost-effective as Double Dorans on Nocturne imo, if you don't go for heavy dragon control early. Double Dorans build is better if you farm for late game and/or gank for your team.

Edit: Wards are cool and Phage to gank as well but Wriggles and Phage are quite costly and are not that good when you still sit on their recipe items.

**Edit 2:** Wow, I didn't expect that much feedback. I think I really got it now that it's really, really situational not to go Wriggles on Nocturne or at least not as obvious as I thought it would be to go double dorans. btw I am playing since december 2009 and the feeling that I still have so much room for improvement is part of the reason I love this game.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1345501838.0,,,True,t3_yj3c4,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/yj3c4/double_dorans_or_wriggles_on_nocturne/,

Cleaver is not a tool to initiate teamfights well, nor is running at them with Mundo Ult or Bear Stance, these are counter initiation and chasing tools at best for teamfights. Shyvana's dragon transformation is a pretty great initiation tool though. This means if you could use the advantage of a speed clearer/counter jungler but your team has no strong initiators, Shyvana is a better pick! Trying to use Mundo or Udyr when your team needs an initiator will result in you pacing back and forth at a team standoff waiting for someone else to make the first move, or you will run in headfirst and probably get blown up.

This probably comes across as a bit of a rant but I hate hearing people say that Shyvana is nothing more than a weak Mundo and you should just play Mundo instead. Picks are situational, Mundo being a better pick than Shyvana 100% of the time is simply not the case.

I've been running into this a lot recently - discussions about item choices or summoner spells that get sidetracked early because people are arguing over the use of the word ""good.""

Riot did a pretty great job at giving the player a ton of options to customize their champions.  Different items, spells, runes, and masteries can be combined to suit your role or playstyle.  You get value out of almost any item choice, with very few exceptions.  You can see this from the extreme flexibility of some champions (e.g. Gangplank), or why people can play troll builds and still do well.  In short, **almost every build choice helps make the champion stronger in some way**.

The problem is that **item builds are ""bad"" because of opportunity cost (what you give up from other options), not because the stats don't help**.  Yes, picking up a Frozen Mallet on your ranged AD carry will help you chase and survive longer.  However, by getting that extra health and passive, you're *giving up on the damage you'd have if you bought an IE instead*.  This is why people say Clarity is bad.  This is why you don't build damage on your supports, you don't stack Archangels, and you don't get GP10 items on everybody.  In order to label item builds as good or bad, you have to **compare what you're trying to accomplish with the potential alternatives**.

**tl;dr - build choices are ""bad"" because other things are better, even if they provide some value themselves.**

**More in-depth example + theorycrafting 101 below:**

If you're a ranged AD carry, your job is to dish out physical damage by the truckload on whoever's in range.  That's basically it.  If you're building an AD carry, you need to take your ultimate goal - damage - and weight your choices based on that.  FroMal gives you 20 AD - that's good!  We like AD!  But IE gives you 80 AD, AND crits for days.  So now, we weigh the other benefits of FroMal versus IE to see how they compare:

**Frozen Mallet**

* 20 AD
* 700 HP
* 30% slow on every AA (40% for melee, but we're talking ranged AD)

**Infinity Edge**

* 80 AD
* 25% Crit Change
* +50% Crit Damage

The AD balances itself out easily - IE is +60 AD over FroMal.  So we're left with the rest - how does 700 HP and 30% slow compare to 25% crit chance and +50% crit damage?  It's we could try to view this empirically without lots of math (which is totally doable, albeit a little complicated!), except **we already know the goal - tons of damage**.  A ranged AD is, well, ranged, so survivability is less important.  The slow is a nice bonus, good for chasing down those stragglers, but **chasing down stragglers is not as important as doing da damages**.

In this case, **building Frozen Mallet is bad on a ranged AD because you could have bought Infinity Edge**.  This continues down the line - you have IE, so maybe NOW we build FroMal?  Well, the alternative would be Phantom Dancer for the AtSpd and Crit chance (which IE loves so very much), and we immediately see that doing more damage with PD is more important than tanking with FroMal.  So on and so on, until we're left with the standard AD carry build - IE, PD, LW, etc, of which FroMal is not included.",,False,,t5_2smhl,True,,,True,t3_sb3us,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/sb3us/opportunity_cost_the_difference_between_good_and/,

If a carry is considered strong, they're nearly unstoppable in teamfights; with the reworked Master Yi, we've seen multiple complaints about constant multikills in all divisions. If they're weak, they're confined to splitpushing or uselessness (like Fiora; mind you, I like Fiora and enjoy playing her, but I don't see her being played in competitive play any time soon). The issue is that melee carries are so static that there is no real skill necessary to play them; the skill floor of these champions are fairly low (which is why Master Yi is 450 IP, a recommended champ, and has consistently stomped low ELO/level games), and the skill ceiling is tied directly to their raw power, not their ability to position or kite, like ranged carries.

The problem does not lie so much in the champion design, and I personally believe that changing or updating the champions will help (I do understand that Master Yi's change was more in response to AP Yi and the skill floor/cap issue). I don't think we can ever see a meta where melee carries are viable until the game sees a major overhaul; if the changes for S4 aren't significant enough, it could easily be another two-three years before any changes are made in the game mechanics itself to give melee carries an opportunity to be played competitively.

So the meta that current meta for top lane in the competitive sphere favors champions with range such as: Ryze, Kennen, Jayce, sometimes Rumble, etc.  
  
Basically, these champs are good because they are capable of surviving and farming in a 2v1 scenario. That's one of the major aspects that makes him a strong pick in that meta.  
  
However, in SoloQue, we aren't switching lanes very often. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a lane swap (only silver I, mind you). So with that in mind, shouldn't we be rating our top lane champions, by different standards? For instance, their ability to fight 1v1 and survive jungler ganks?  
  
What do you guys think?

Sorry I've been MIA for almost a week now, after getting Platinum I took a big break from elo climbing, during which I goofed around with friends I hadn't played with in awhile, wrote the articles you (if you've been following me) are familiar with, and experimented with some new champs/strats, etc. I wanted to get back in elo climbing ""gear,"" because that is where I get my best ideas for articles, and now that I am ([proof] (http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/35351100)), will continue writing again.

I wrote [before] (http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1fk5id/how_to_get_more_from_your_solo_que_team/) on general rules for coordinating your team of random strangers you know nothing about. Today, I'd like to start discussing simple, specific plays that anyone can use to coordinate their team. Let's start at the start, with Level 1 ""strats.""

* I wrote about my favorite L1 ""strat,"" [The Solo Queue Invade] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1f8845/the_solo_que_invade_70_success_rate_1_failure_rate/) before. This requires communication during champion select, and usually a few pings to remind people, but that's it.

* Another very popular invade was to leave from the river bush near blue buff at 1:37 or so, and ambush the jungler and their leashers as they come to blue buff. With the recent changes to jungle, this needs to be adapted to leaving at 1:57, but can still be useful. If you bring the jungler with you there is potential to steal the buff, otherwise you can 1: try to go for kills or 2: make the leash realllly difficult. Going for kills involves more risk/reward, while simply harassing them as they try to leash can usually be done quite safely, and essentially for free (what else are you going to do during that time?). Again, all this really requires is some communication during select, or even once the game starts.

* **A very rare invade** (that a friend of mine showed me) I have run a couple of times (and never seen anyone else do) requires 2 people, the jungler and usually the midlaner. Let's say both junglers start at blue buff. After leashing for your jungler, don't go to your lane, instead go to the bush by wraiths. When the enemy jungler comes through, jump him, and if you get a kill you will set him back into the stone age. As long as someone has ignite, and there is 1-2 forms of CC (the jungler will be L2) it's usually not that difficult. The danger of doing this invade with total strangers is that the kill might flash away to their nearby tower, and they might flash after, giving up a kill themselves. If you tell them not to do so ahead of time, the odds of this happening are much lower. Even if you don't get a kill, you can make it incredibly difficult for them to clear their jungle, and reduce their early game presence across the map, which your team will surely benefit from.

* One strat that was used every game in pre-30 matches, and could potentially make a comeback with the jungle changes, is the ARAM Ambush. If you don't need to leash for your jungler, and you don't want to invade, just run to your lanebush to jump the enemy when they come. As always with L1 strats (and LoL in general) the way to make this work is to be satisfied with a small edge. Maybe you don't even force a flash, but if you burst someone down to half that will make laning considerably easier, and will give your team instant pressure. Again, **Talk in select, it's free time that Riot gives you.**

* The last L1 ""strat"" is lane swapping. I'm not sure why I don't see this more often in Solo Queue, since it's so simple. Make sure you have a better 1v2 than they do, usually someone with range will do better than a melee, and ranged supports are much better than melee ones because they can harass under tower. As long as the 2v1ers know they should be harass heavy, as well as pushing their lane (probably focusing more on pushing than harassing, as long as they can deny farm) and 1v2er knows they mostly just needs to stay alive and grab what farm they can.

**The glory of L1 strats is that the are incredibly simple (since everyone only has 1 skill plus summoners) and you can plan them out during select, time that you don't get anywhere else in the match. If you aren't using this to your advantage, you are shooting yourself in the foot.** You will notice most of the things I listed here are fairly common knowledge. The difference is that some people do them, while others just know about them. If you put these into practice regularly you will learn to work out the kinks, and can begin to get most of your games off on the right foot, because not only will this give you a physical edge (debilitated jungler, weakened lane, early kills, etc.) but it will get your team to have more confidence in each other, build morale, etc.

If this seemed overly simple, don't worry, L1 ""strats"" are all pretty simple, as long as you talk in select (as I'm mentioning intentionally for the 50th time), you can pull them off very successfully. Tomorrow should be a bit more complex as we discuss the early stages of the game.

As always, I encourage you to add, argue, etc. in the comments.

So I thought about a way to fix that; build multi-target damage and rely on it. 

Tiamat, Frozen Fist, Sunfire, and Staik Shiv were all items that I tried and I was surprised at how well the build worked out.

He's a great duelist and has great escapability, so if they want to stop you, they need to invest multiple champions in doing so.  Be careful not to finish the tiamat until you can push safely or at least until your lane opponent starts roaming.

For those of you who haven’t read them, this is the latest I have seen.

* **[Q] - Taste Their Fear** - Now increases isolated damage by 45% instead of saying increased to 100/145/190/235/280
* **[Q] - Taste Their Fear** - Now does 8% of missing health (down from 12%) now states that it can be increased by isolation

* **[W] - Void Spike** - Now slows enemies by 20% for 2 seconds

* **[W] - Void Spike** - Evolved version no longer has ""Consumes Unseen Threat to slow and damage all enemies struck.""

* **[W] - Void Spike** - now costs 55/60/65/70/75 Mana (down from 60/70/80/90/100 Mana)

Personally I picked him up not too long ago and I agree that he needs tuning down, very strong in almost all aspects of the game. 
For me I think he will be perfectly viable even after the nerf. The 4% cut on Q will of course hurt his burst but he should still be able to take out a squishy target.

If someone who is good on the math would elaborate on the impact of changing to 45% instead of fixed damage on Q that would be appreciated.

What’s your opinion on the changes?

I recently tried him this season and rocked 4 2 24 KDA and will be trying it more often. If you have any other experience, lemme know!

I ran him attack speed reds, armor blues, MR / level blues, and movespeed quints. I ran 0 21 9 jungle tank masteries...though I am contemplating 9 21 0 masteries as I tend to be a support jungler and hand off buffs to laners as soon as I can...thereby not needing the increased buff duration as much as more attack speed / arpen. 

Skilled E first as it can serve as an auto attack reset if you time it right...taking q at level two for a gank on top or mid. I prioritized R W Q E. Built machete / 5 pots first. My build order was spirit stone, mobility boots, shurelyas, and pink wards as often as possible as I had the income for them. Definitely not a farming jungle, I ganked lanes as often as possible, often picking up oracle to clear wards out of lanes for ganks. 

I think that jungle Blitz requires a damage heavy team to make up for his relative lack of damage...but one pull can change a team fight drastically. He also needs a damage heavy team to really lock down buffs / dragon / baron. He requires protection and a strong leash on blue to start but can impact lanes ganking so greatly that counter jungling isn't too problematic. I had only 41 farm in the game but made up for it going 2 0 10 during laning.

1368405164.0,20,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1e7q3r,Detailed analysis on melee ADCs,tigerbloodz,34,14,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1e7q3r/detailed_analysis_on_melee_adcs/,"For reference, here's a melee carry in DOTA before we begin.

http://www.playdota.com/heroes/faceless-void


In LoL, he'd be a tank because he can't rely on the agility stat to deal lots of damage and because his damage would be nerfed to hell anyway because of his incredible amount of CC.


The main reason melee carries work in Dota is a combination of itemization, toolkit, and how stats work.


For items, Black King Bar (BKB). This item grants the user 10sec of magical immunity with a diminishing return value each use (minimum of 5sec). Burst damage and disables are the common source for shutting down carries and this item prevents (keyword) most of this, allowing the user to stay in the fray.


For stats and abilities,most melee carries in Dota are usually either Strength or Agility heroes, meaning, in addition to the normal benefits from increasing your stats (more hp/hp regen and armor/attack speed respectively), you are also doing more damage via auto-attacks. Abilities do not scale in Dota either, so heroes who are able to shut down carries early to mid game will fall off once the game goes late.


The toolkits melee carries have in Dota also allow them to carry successfully. Juggernaut &amp; Lifestealer have a built-in BKB. Kunkka has an initiate ability as his ultimate combined with splash damage. Sven has cleave, crits, and a very powerful aoe stun with steroids. Melee carries have the ability to not only pump out large numbers but also get into melee range and survive.


In short, Melee carries in DotA are melee carries because their kit makes them incredibly safe and the Agility stat scales stupidly well (it gives Agility heros attack speed, attack damage and armor). Nasus, Riven, Jax, Akali  and Tryndamere are closer to DotA's melee carries than the glass cannons that LoL calls melee carries are. Tryndamere has the potential to be great because he can actually survive long enough to put out his damage while being able to CC the enemy and constantly gapclose but remains balanced because of items like Frozen heart and Randuins.

Don't get me wrong,alot of melee ADCs do fine up top / in the jungle. The problem is team fighting against organised teams.It's very hard to do your damage output without getting CC'd and simply blown up. It's like telling your ADC to focus the enemy carry.No matter how much they want to 2-shot that enemy Ezreal, if they ever get in range they're most likely dead themselves. It might be worth the trade, but i'd rather have a tanky peeler like Jax or Sejuani than someone who dives in head first who may or may not kill the enemy ADC.

To quote ""demonryder""

&gt;sure, alot of melee ADCs do fine up top / in the jungle but the problem is team fighting against organised teams.
A carry can do fine in lane, but there is no way to teamfight effectively considering you can just get nuked or cc locked. You cannot just ignore madcs because they are dotaish, they are already in the game and have to be dealt with. If you look at master Yi, a generic madc, he has no way to live in a fight considering his only survival option causes him TO STOP DEALING DAMAGE. That is bad design. Good design would be sion style, but it was never balanced. He has the characteristics of a good carry, but there has never been balance for him. Theoretically, if he were balanced, sion could deal with autoattacks because of his passive damage reduction, he would be innately tanky from his AD steroid that boosts his hp, and he would survive fights because of his massive lifesteal and shield. That's good design, but no effort was put forth to make it viable, so instead people chose to play ap sion.

&gt;Mundo, Yi, Fiora, Olaf, GP, Sion, and Tryn, for example, are all designed so that they could be a good melee ADC, but they are either bad or better off with another build. None of these characters ever receive balance changes surrounding their ability to be an adc because Riot has made them not viable because they don't want to balance them for their intended roles and has just hit them with nerfs and left them to rot.
Mundo was designed so that he could be able to run around the fight and not take too much damage while ignoring cc and be able to dps down people, but instead he was only really viable as a tank because no work was done around his adc potential
Yi was designed to be able to run around the fight and get kills and be able to protect himself with meditate while he lost focus so he could go for another kill, but because this is the League of CC that ability is pretty much useless unless you are AP. There is no reason to play him of a ranged adc because he has their dps output but has to get in close. Even if vayne was melee she would be safer than Yi, he is just in a terrible spot balance wise.

&gt;Fiora just lacks number buffs and her parry or w/e it is called is laughable. 1 hit. woo. You run in with fiora and try to do cheese damage with her ulti and tiamat or hydra, but she can't do anything when she is done because she will just get cc locked or nuked.
Olaf had good design for an adc but he was built with hp in mind, and riot decided that they didn't want him dealing damage so they made atma's a terrible item, forcing him to be a tank to not waste his money.

&gt;GP was fine for a good period of time but he just got hit from too many number nerfs to the point where there are just better characters than him. His only decent build is tank at this point so that he can just aura spam and help the team as a support really.
Sion had good design for a generic carry but his numbers were put in a bad position and never touched because Riot doesn't like him because of his stun and decided to ignore him for over a year.
Tryn is the best out of all of them because his ult is good, but again, there is no good way to deal with cc so people would just rather have a ranged carry or a bruiser. Tryn only excels in games where he has already won and anyone could finish it.

&gt;As to your point of the carries being an assassin, there is a big difference. An assassin is a a physcal mage, who is in a good position. They aren't required to autoattack because their spells do everything that they need, so even if they get cc'd they already got their combo out and can run away and come back for another combo. Compare zed to yi. Both of them have mechanics that allow them to avoid damage and get away, but yi has to stand still and be vulnerable while he attacks while zed can just do the combo on the adc, kill, and gtfo. Big difference. An adc is designed with a kit in mind to allow him to attack people through tankiness and cc (see sion). It's similar to a bruiser, but bruisers have high numbers and scalings on their abilities rather than the ability to get a bunch of hits in, like a mix of assassin and adc. You seem to misunderstand the definition of carry by saying they make a good kill lane. These characters play just like a ranged carry but are melee. They are weak early and should be the dominant force late game, but instead they are weak late and just get instagibbed.


So we know why they don't work : now we could scrap the role all together and continue to have our stale meta OR we can try to make them viable,fun,risky and rewarding.Not only would this fix MADCs but would change the pace of the game for the better while attracting players who've left to Dota back in for a fresh experience.The best way to fix them would be one at a time but that would for sure require scrapping AP builds which are popular on most on them (See Yi,Sion and old AP Trynd) while changeing the way stats work overall.For instance, Critical Strike would also provide 10 health and 1 armor for every  point (melee only) but bruisers wouldn't be able to utilize this mechanic as well because of the lack of AA steroids while someone like Yi would be significantly tankier thanks to this.


Another solution could be adding LoL's own version of BKB. It's doesn't take a genius to know that Guardian's Horn was an item ment to test out the viability of MADCs and experiment on how it could work on a map where teamfights are constant.Why not implement an item with negative stats to deter bruisers while bringing sustained damage??  

&gt;For example:

&gt;Guardian's Blade (Melee only):

&gt;-200 health
&gt;-10 armor
&gt;+45 AD
&gt;+10% lifesteal
&gt;+12% crit

&gt;Build path BF sword + Vamp scepter + Avarice blade = 2800 gold cost

&gt;Unique Active (Beserker's Mark) : On activation,reduces the duration on of stuns, slows, taunts, fears, silences, blinds and immobilizes by 75% by for 3 seconds (120/90/60 cooldown)

&gt;Unique Passive (Spirit Charge) : Every 100 auto attacks or ability  uses within 600 range passively give you 1 Spirit Charge (1 second cooldown) when you reach 100 spirit charges, 
Beserker's Mark's cooldown is reduced by 30 seconds - this only works up to 3 times.

&gt;Your Spirit Charges would be gauged as a passive similar to Static Shyv's Icon.

The negative health would deter bruisers because they wouldn't have the DPS to sustain themselves and make up for their negative health therefore,it would just be a bad buy on most and would make it difficult for them to stay in the fight.But what if we added another mechanic that could work like bash? For those who don't know what bash :

**Bash is a passive ability that gives a unit a chance to deal bonus damage and stun its target on attack**.

How would this effect someone like Fiora? Let's say every 7 attacks or ability uses she bashes a target for .3 seconds: 

* She could be able to Q (Lunge) at a escaping enemy (2/7 charges) 

* then proceed to auto attack them with her W active (5/7) 

* then reflecting an enemy auto attack (6/7) then allowing her next attack to bash 

* then after bashing she ultimates to once again proc her bash. (7/7)

She could be able to retain her long cool-downs and stick to a target while dealing some decent damage and her extreme squishyness.Seems fair,don't you think? She still puts herself into the fray while utilizing her abilities and she is able to kill a target.Thoughts? 

**Remember this is theory crafting and I think it's time we  work for melee ADCs to have a fighting chance competitively**.

I was wondering.   
  
Here is the assessment :  
- Hybrid damage is a counter to building only Armor or Magic Resist.  
- S3 has reinforced penetration, offering ways to counter building only Armor or Magic Resist even if you don't build hybrid.  
- Hybrid damage requires both Mpen and ArPen, which is expensive.  
- Building tons of flat Health kind of counters Hybrid damage (because it becomes equivalent to one-type damage).  
  
  
  


In your opinion, to what extent has S3 impacted Hybrid build paths / champions? Is it a big issue? Do you still play Hybrid champions? Would you like to see hybrid masteries / items?

So a lich bane gives you 50 + 0.75AP on your next auto, 80AP and 5% movement speed.

An early sheen gives you 2AD on your next auto and 25 AP.

However suppose your AP carry (kayle, tf can both rush it) has 85 AD by the time you get your lich bane surely it is wasted? 

At this AD you can also suggest that they have 100AP so with a lich bane the next auto will do 125+80 while the sheen gives you just 45 less damage however it costs 1800g less then the lich bane. For which you could pick up a needlessly large rod or something to provide a lot more damage. Why bother with the lich bane so early?

1362100432.0,22,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,19flyn,Support Gangplank discussion.,Polyether,25,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/19flyn/support_gangplank_discussion/,"I've been running support Gangplank almost exclusively in normals when I am forced into the support role, and it has been working extremely well.  It took me a few games to finalize my masteries and runes and skill order, but I think I have it down quite well now and would like to start a discussion as to his viability as a support when paired with the right AD.  I will go over the basics of what GP brings to the table and the specific setup that I use for this role.  If all of this is old news, please skip to the bottom where the AD synergy discussion takes place.

**PROS**

Grog Soaked Blade works as a stacking slow during skirmishes and engages.

Parrrley, 625 range, procs the melee version of pickpocket (5 gold) and is on a 5 second cooldown (same as pickpocket cooldown), translating to 10 gold/10 seconds (best case scenario).(IMO this is the best part about support GP, this mechanic allows him to farm gold better than any other support)

Remove Scurvy can be used to bait out CC and to sustain you while in lane.

Raise Morale acts as a move speed and attack damage buff to you and nearby allies.

Cannon Barrage offers a global presence, allowing you to pickup assists across the map.

**CONS**

Melee champion, vulnerable to harass.

Can't sustain his ally at all, only offers a little bit of poke and a small buff.

Ultimate can be unreliable for damage if the RNG is not in your favor.

**RUNES**

I've been using AD reds, armor yellows, CDR or mana regen blues and GP/10 quints.

**MASTERIES**

I run 0/13/17, picking up health, armor, reduced damage and reduced slows in defense, and taking standard support points in Utility down to the pick pocket mastery.

**SKILLS**

I start Q/W/E, usually getting three points in heal by level 5, then maxing R/E/W/Q.  I leave Q for last because as support I don't plan on offering much damage, I use it for the pickpocket gold and to apply a stack of my passive slow.

**ITEMS**

Item start is standard for any support; I begin with the biscuit and explorer ward, then grab faerie charm, 3 vision wards, 2 health pots and 1 mana pot.  First trip back I try to get Philosopher's stone and sight stone, second trip back is upgraded sight stone, boots and any piece of Aegis that can be afforded.  Runic Bulwark is my first big item rush, followed by a Kindlegem to be turned into either Shurelya's or Locket, both of which should be purchased by the end of the game.

**DISCUSSION**

**CHAMPION SYNERGY**

This is where I would like to get some discussion going.  I like to compare support GP to support Nunu, and by that I mean Nunu is a GREAT support when paired with the right champ (Caitlyn, Kog), and only an average support when paired with many others.  GP and Nunu's kits are very similar; they both have a damage poke on their Q, a self heal, and an ally buff; Nunu's offers attack speed while GP's offers attack damage.  For this reason, Nunu works best with champs that already have damage buffs, while GP would work best with champs that already have attack speed buffs.  For this reason, Tristana, Graves, Miss Fortune, Draven, Twitch, Ezreal, and maybe Varus are the champions that I would pick into a GP support lane because they can buff their own attack speed and make good use of the additional damage that GP provides.  The laning phase should consist of you using Q every time it is up, regardless of which enemy champ you are hitting.  You are not trying to poke them down, you are just trying to get the free pick pocket gold.  I have been able to use Q pretty much constantly in the lanes I have run and do not have any mana issues.  I start with the standard support items of faerie charm, wards and pots, and the mana regen through charm and masteries/runes is plenty to keep me capped off.

The big draw for me to picking GP as a support is the amount of gold that I can safely farm, many games I end up with more gold than both my jungler and my top laner.  This allows you to get big team benefiting items such as Bulwark or Kindlegem upgrades long before the enemy team has these items, allowing you to push for team fights that should be in your favor.

**TL;DR** Pickpocket mastery and Parrrley allow you to farm up gold faster and safer than any other support.  Snowball this lead to get big ticket items that benefit your team and win by being in the better position for team fights.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_19flyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/19flyn/support_gangplank_discussion/,

His damage items are always only Iceborn Gaunlet, Muramana/Manamune, and Spirit of the Elder Lizard.

His tank items include Iceborn Gauntlet, Boots 2, Spirit Visage and HP items/Situatonal after that

Gauntlet, Spirit Visage, and Spirit of the Elder Lizard all provide CDR, and its adds up to 40% CDR

Yorick is a champion that scales well with CDR, HP, and AD, because his ghouls have 35% of his AD and HP. BUT Yorick's Ghouls can only auto 3 times in their life span and can only live up to 5 seconds. Q has a 5s CD at lvl 5, W has a flat 12s throughout, and E has a 6s CD at lvl 5.

40% CDR makes his his Q a 3s CD, his W a 7.2s CD, and E a 3.6s CD, not to mention his ult which would be a 54s CD (all at lvl 5). His Q or E won't ever live the full 5 seconds in a teamfight due to AoE and other factors but Q and E will basically wont have any down time. R at a 54s CD can help you take a free turret down. More Ghouls you have active, the more likely you'll have your 5%-15% DMG Reduction and auto dmg increased.

**Spirit of the Elder Lizard:**

- Ridiculously Gold Efficient like Spirit of the Spectral Wraith, and cheap (AP) 

&gt; 50 attack damage = 2000g, &gt;14 health regeneration = 504g, 7 mana regeneration = 420g = *Total Gold Value = 2924g* Not including its 2 passives

10% CDR = 322g. So for 2300g, you get 3246g of stats + 25% more dmg to monsters/neutrals, AND 15-66 True DMG DoT over 3 seconds. 

- Stats he can use: AD, CDR, Mana Regen, Dragon/Baron Control, Free bonus DMG. 

*Couldn't You Buy Black Cleaver instead?*

Maybe, Black Cleaver is 3000g and Lizard is 2300g. They both provide 50 AD and 10% CDR, But Cleaver gives ArPen and HP, and Lizard gives MRegen, Free DMG, and Buff Control at a lower price.

700g is a big difference, and will allow you to buy more tank stats (will let you be more relevant). You already would deal 3 types of dmg: magic (W+E , manamura), true (Lizard Buff), phys (Gaunlet Proc, Q, R, Ghoul Autos + Yorick Autos).

720g for 40 armor or 40 mr and turns into Glacial or Spirit Visage Respectively, 1000g gives you 380hp and upgrades into Warmogs. His kit and Gaunlet provide enough utilty aswell, but it may be a better choice if you are peeling, but then again Yorick loses farm after mid game because of his lack of wave clear.  

- Ghoul Auto's proc Black Cleaver but don't proc Lizard Elder.

&gt;* Siphoning Strike
Mana cost reduced to 20 at all ranks from 20/25/30/35/40

&gt;* Fury of the Sands
Now increases attack range by 50 and cast range by 100 while active
Mana cost reduced to 100 from 150

As someone who got into LoL by playing Nasus (and has since maybe played him in 2-3 ranked games out of about 200 due to his irrelevancy), I was very excited about the buffs, and I've gotten a chance to play him in a few ranked games. Here's my initial thoughts on playing him top (or potentially as a kill lane bruiser bottom):

**Counters**

Darius and Teemo wreck Nasus still without considerable help from the jungle. Darius out-trades you substantially, and Teemo shuts you down with the range harass + blind.

Other tops that probably counter Nasus now but I haven't seen yet would be Malphite, Vlad, or Yorick, but this is pure speculation for me at this point.

**Easy Lanes**

So far, the easiest lanes were anyone that needs to farm. Singed and Nidalee were laughably easy.

**Items**

Nasus still needs some sustain outside of attacking, so I pick up early philo. Probably a noob move there, but it helps in keeping up in gold too. Max CDR seems core now since you basically never run out of mana for Q. I've been rushing Iceborn and getting Spirit Visage after that. That leaves 10% remaining which you could either fill with a Black Cleaver, runes, masteries, or something else, but I've found ~30% to be good enough and I usually stop there and pick up a BF sword to keep damage up (and annihilate the squishies in a team fight).

Boots are entirely situational, but usually either Merc, Ninja, Swiftness, or maybe Ionian. After the BF sword, Nasus needs tankiness, so depending on if there's already an Aegis on your team, Warmog's was next, after which I'd complete the BF into Bloodthirster (maybe IE) and then GA.

**Runes and Masteries**

I've been running 9-21-0, and it's working for me. I pick up 3% CDR in offensive tree, and the rest is to pick up armor pen. My runes are arpen reds, move speed quints, armor or health yellows, and magic resist blues. Nasus requires some kind of tankiness in his build, so I'm simply trying to compliment that here. Probably lots of better options out there, but again, this has worked for me.

**Gameplay**

Laning is so much better now. Q will never leave you OOM (esp with a philo), so you're free to use W and E more frequently and defensively now without losing the mana to continue to farm your Q. I'm consistently getting to 100 damage on my Q right around the 10 minute mark, and getting to 200 or 300 by 20 minutes. 

The farthest I've gotten is 35 minutes, and I had 502 damage from farming alone on my Q.

I've heard that jungle Nasus is legit now as well. A buddy at higher elo said he had a Nasus jungle that just straight farmed until level 6, and came out of the jungle with 300 damage on his Q. Flash + W on your gank, and you'll kill most people. My friend has a tendency to embellish though, so I'd love to hear how well Nasus has fared in the jungle for anyone else.

At the same time, however, she needs lane farm to reach her full potential as a front line bruiser.

This strategy is pretty much based (for the early game at least) on an FYA Umashi guide I saw in Season 2, that I can't find anymore. Basically, Umashi suggested running Flash/Teleport and jungling masteries/runes. He would steal whichever enemy buff that the jungler wasn't starting at, recall (because he'd be too low to lane effectively), and then Teleport to lane with Level 2 and the buff, and use the advantage to dominate the lane. 

Once you're in lane, use your buff and level advantage to aggressively zone your opponent. You can also use your W freely to push the lane-when you hit their turret, go roam the enemy jungle and kill the enemy camps to keep farming and deny the enemy jungler farm.

Would this kind of strategy still work in Season 3? I want to try it, but I'm not sure how the upgraded jungle creeps will effect this strat. Maybe I'll be forced into starting Machete and then selling it when I back after the first buff. Maybe I'll have to rush Wriggles to clear the enemy jungle at a reasonable pace.

That's 196 magic damage per hit, to up to three targets, with 2.5 attack speed - that's 490 damage per second, *per target*.

But! It gets better. In addition to the damage, Varus's Blighted Quiver adds Blight, which stacks up to three times per target. Blight is ignited by his other abilities hitting the target, dealing (with the above items) roughly 9% of the target's max HP *per stack* in damage.


This potentially lets Varus provide a lot of sustained, virtually mana-free (freeing up blue buff for someone else on the team) damage output from relatively safe range.

I kinda have a problem with playing mid. My enemies always seem like to know when to gank bot and top effectively without losing too much farm and doing it successfully. 

If I gank top or bot, the other mid always takes down my turret in an instant or ganks the opposite lane while getting 1 or 2 kills while I maybe don't get even one and just lose XP and farm.

I find that the better I get, the more pages I make with MS quints.  I've gotten to the point where every jungle and AP mid page I make uses MS quints, and I use them on most of my top laners.  The only time I don't use them is when I play AD carry, a support that isn't Alistar, or champs that I feel don't need them (Fiora mid, for example), but there have been several times I've wished I'd had them.

It just seems to me that the slight early game boost that AP or AD quints give become dwarfed by the effectiveness of MS quints throughout the entire game.

Does anyone else feel this way, or are there better strategies I could/should be utilizing?

Edit:  Thank for the replies, and since we are talking about MS, I have something else I'd like to add.

What about Boots of Swiftness?  I know its the ""noob boot"" and people get laughed at when building it, but hear me out.  I wouldn't use them early game, but what about a late game, 4-5 item build.  Say you are the AP carry, you have your deathcap, your void staff, maybe a holy grail or what not, and you are doing a really good amount of damage.  How much good is that 20 flat magic pen really doing?  Same for the AD carry.  You have your BT, IE, PD, and LW, how much is that 20% AS really helping your damage?  In either of those roles, Merc treads wouldn't help out all that much because if you get caught, you are dead anyway, but it seems that the extra MS would help out so much in late game team fights where positioning is, in my opinion, the most important part.  

I understand flat magic pen is fantastic early game where people don't have a lot of MR and the early AS is a huge damage increase.  It just seems to me that since MS is so difficult to itemize for (Lich Bane, PD, FoN, and Ghostblade Active are the only non boot sources I can think of) and how squishy carries are late game the extra movement speed would help out so much more than 20% AS or 20 magic pen.  It could be the difference between dodging the Unstoppable Force or the Rupture that would have otherwise killed you.

I worked my way up to 1730 elo playing mainly mid and bot champions. I do really well in the mid role, but everyone and their mother wants to call it. So instead of piss people off and pick it first if i'm high up in the que, i wanted to take on another role. 

I decided i wanted to jungle. I really like the idea of jungling, and i like that the skill of a jungler is less micro and more macro (i.e. it's about what the overall game plan is.) 

I really love jungling. But i've been hitting a brick wall and i wanted to solicit the community. 

The problems i see: 

Ganking. I don't know how to do it, i guess. I try to take exhaust on almost every jungle i can get away with. The problem is that bot is almost ALWAYS warded to the point that only a lane gank would work, but even then 7 times out of 10 it's warded. 

Mid my problem tends to be that **I** can get into a good position, but my midlane rarely is in a position to follow up. Typically, the enemy will be at 90% HP. I can go in, deal my damage, and chase them down. They get to the tower with 40% HP left and my mid never did anything to them. Because of this, i try to wait until their mid will get past the middle of the river, then go. But at this point, our mid just sits at tower and CS's and the gank fails. If i go before this point, their mid just trots off like nothing happened. 

As for top, i'll admit i've not spent much time there in any of my games. I normally get something like a nid (my team) against a jax on theirs. The few times i tried to go top they tend to skirt away with an easy escape (i consider jax and jayce un-gankable unless they're ON my tops' tower, so i just ignore it.) 

**What i'd like to do**
Counter jungling: I'm scared to counter jungle, honestly. Enemy junglers rarely leave their jungle except to gank (i've been counter jungled maybe twice when i was losing incredibly hard?). I've always felt like it was not worth the reward to run all the way to their camps to have them maybe be up. I'm guessing this is something i do if i see their jungler on the map?

Counter ganking: I love the idea. No freaking clue how to pull it off. It seems like enemy junglers are too random to be able to accurately counter-gank unless they're standing on a ward (which, by the way, maybe one lane will have out at any given time.) 

So, that's basically it. I love jungling, it seems like something that few people actually master. I watch the major jungler streams (oddone, SV, hotshot, ect) but i feel like i can't apply their tatics to my games. I'm hovering in the mid to low 1600's now. Getitng an oracles and clearing wards isn't enough to make the enemy bot lane play passive and lose CS. Flash- twisted advancing an enemy midlane just leaves me out there getting them to 40% while my mid picks their nose. 

I know this is a long post, so i'll try to summarize some questions and a tl;dr

**Questions**
1) How to gank a lane? When is best to gank a lane? How do i get my lanes to not play like morons when i gank? (i.e. just standing so far back they can't help OR just going balls deep for no reason and giving me away.) 

2) When is it worth it to counter-jungle? When should i look to get oracles? 

3) How much of my time should i spend farming my jungle, and under what conditions should i farm it, and what conditions should i be going to gank?

I started ranked last March, a month after I hit level 30 and climbed to 1550 spamming rumble and blitzcrank(lol). Since then I've been slowly climbing back up from 1100 (1350 atm) because I started playing ranked with the same approach of casual soloq normals (Yeah, I was one of those people.). Anyway this information is useless.

In late August I decided to go back to tryharding in ranked and stop fucking around. After watching several streams and analyzing statistics I felt that jungling was the best way to climb elo. Since the jungle rework it has been balanced to offer a wide variety of roles and champions and build paths for any situation. Which has since proven true as I've maintained some pretty ridiculous winrates.

The point in this is that, I've realized that the jungle, since the rework has become pretty damn colorful. Which is ultimately Riot's goal with every role in the game. A year ago the jungle was nothing but generic bruisers, Lee sin/Udyr/Warwick were pretty much seen every (serious) game, there was some nocturne played. This pretty much remained the same for awhile after the jungle was reworked with a few exceptions.  Shyvana and Mundo started to emerge, they didn't really evolve into high tier picks until they saw frequent play in tournaments.

So, what happened? Maokai really started to emerge after TheOddOne played him in the new jungle in a tournament. Skarner started turning up more after people figured out to play him and several videos of him clearing emerged on reddit around last January.. Alistar gained popularity, Amumu got buffed back into viability, Nautilus was released, Nunu got buffed into viability, Xin got reworked, Diana came out, Cho'Gath jungle reemerged. What I really like about a lot of these junglers is that had you picked them 2-3 months before they gained popularity somebody in your team chat would say something along the lines of “Jungle _____? What the FUCK..” What I love is now there is so much stuff you can do. Agressive early ganking? Jungle farming? Roaming cc ganker? Counter jungler? Buff and objective control? etc.

As the jungle has developed over past year, Riot has had little involvement as far as I can remember(Besides post release tweaks and ALISTAR GETTING NERFED INTO THE DIRT), Lee sin and Nautilus saw a few nerfs, but besides that I feel that Riot has done a pretty good job at not continuously fucking with the jungle. (Besides Alistar my love). I can understand a bit though, one true balance problem that has come out of the jungle is that Riot releases junglers and people just take them top/midlane and wreck face because they can use abilities to instagib the creep wave and then dominate their opponent, not to mention since they have jungle kits they assist ganks SO WELL for their junglers. (Looking at Diana and Rengar here.)

So what am I going at here? I don't even know, I've just observed that bottom lane has slumped into the same state the jungle was a year ago and I feel it makes for a good discussion. Although, I'm sure we've all noticed [Miss Fortune](http://www.lolking.net/champions/missfortune#statistics) making a comeback. One main problem is of course how the game is balanced, funneling gold into an AD carry is just so rewarding that an AD carry is just a must-have for every team comp. We saw some evolution when Urgot emerged, but he got nerfed out of viability by Riot. This is all written pretty badly and I'm very sorry I've had a long day haha..

It was my first time laning against Rengar, so that could have something to do with my epic failure, but I just couldn't figure out how to handle his burst and play style.

I was playing Rumble, started boots + 3 pot. The enemy Rengar's strategy was to sit in the top bush and use his passive to jump out and last hit minions. If I walked within range, he would jump out on me and drop his combo. I realized I couldn't compete with that damage early on so I was trying to hang back, but ended up getting bola'd/jumped on by the jungle Jax and killed.

At this point the Rengar froze the lane right outside his tower. I could not get remotely close without getting jumped on from the bush and taking massive damage.

I roamed down mid and helped them pick up a kill, but then I had nothing to do. I couldn't even begin to approach minions even just to get XP since Rengar could walk into the top brush and leap on me.

I got a hextech revolver and then rushed a negatron cloak, but it was too late at that point, his damage was still more than I can handle.

I'm just not sure what I could have done differently in that situation, or what to do against a super bursty champ like that. Should you rush a defensive item like a null magic mantle immediately?

It is the same issue that came around when Maw was announced; Melee assassins like Talon can't effectively build CDR. They get ionian boots, Brutalizer, then what? They are sitting at 25% CDR with no other solid options. The items with CDR and no AP are as follows:

* Glacial Shroud - Has a LOT of mana and armor, but no offensive stats at all.
* Zeke's - A solid item, has some health, some AS, CDR and Life steal. Some recent posts show it to be a solid item relative to cost; but assassins need more burst, not more sustained damage (I realize this is an argument against CDR also).
* Brutalizer - Already an early game staple, but has no late game applications. Youmuu's is just too underwhelming, and there is no other build path.
* Ionian boots - Great boots, was a welcome addition to the game; However you are sacrificing the tenacity from merc treads which hurts really bad against some team comps.
* Randuins - Purely tank item.
* Shureleya's - Solid support item, offers nothing to an assassin.
* Spirit Visage - Has a place in some champions' builds, but not in many.
* Stinger - Offers solid CDR for a cheap price, and offers a moderate amount of AS. Also very easy to build.

Why not add a new build path for Brutalizer AND Stinger? They both offer CDR, they both build from Tier one items, they are both melee centric, and they both suffer from having poor build paths. 

* Brawler's Arsenal
* Combined from Brutalizer, Stinger, and some sum of gold (Maybe add a pickaxe or something if needed).
* 35 Attack Damage, 50% Attack Speed, 25% CDR, 20 Armor Penetration.

It offers a new source of Armor pen that could be obtained somewhat early game. It gives AD carries and assassins a MUCH needed source of CDR. It offers a new item that could help an ADC that is behind in lane since it packs early game strength with an attractive late game build path.

I run first item thornmail sometimes on Irelia toplane because, it shuts down a lot of toplaners, melee or ranged. But apparently going like 5/0 when you can kill the toplane and jungler by yourself means you're a nub and should be banned?

I love playing her as AP mid now, and plan to use her more in the future. A couple things that I learned about her:

* She counters pretty much every AP mid that I've played so far, with the exception of Cassiopeia and Swain. Playing against Kassadin and Morgana is incredibly easy.

* She seems to be countered by bruisers or tanks with high mobility, like Pantheon and Garen.

* Her lategame damage falls off rapidly if not enough AP is built. It would make a lot of sense to build her tanky with cdr and AP, but pure AP items with just a few resistances seems to be the best for keeping your lategame damage up.

* Her ultimate is insane in teamfights. Having a heal that heals for 8-900 on all 5 people is gamebreaking, and causes easy wins in teamfights when added with her spot heal, Q spam, and Silence/nuke

* She lacks roaming power. She can't gank well, and is also easily ganked or caught out of position by melle champs with cc/slows.

* She is hard to focus down in teamfights due to her high amounts of heal and armor buff

Last hitting is the skill that benefits the most from out-of-game practice, and is one of the most (if not the most) important skills to learn to be a successful LoL player.  As a ranged AD main, it is by far the most important skill to learn – your entire worth is based off of how fast you get those precious items.  As such, it’s really important to drill the heck out of your last hitting techniques and squeeze every last CS out of the lane.

I try to practice my last-hitting at least once every time I log in.  I’m not that strict about it, of course, but making it a habit is how you’ll keep improving (or, as Morello would says, it’s what separates the good AD carries from the great ones).  Intelligent practice is always better than “just playing” – pro athletes practice drills and scenarios, never a full game.

Here are all of the last-hitting drills I run (although I might have missed one or two):

**Item Choices**

* Pick different starting items – Dorans vs. Boots1 vs. Vamp vs. Cloth vs. nothing (these depend a bit on whether you’re alone or not – vamp/cloth might as well be nothing if you’re not getting harassed)
* Pick different secondary items – stack Dorans vs. Boots2 vs. Zeal vs. B.F. Sword in any combination you can realistically see yourself getting (e.g. try 2 Dorans+Boots2, or B.F. Sword+Dorans+Boots, etc, but IE by itself is silly)

**Accuracy and Lane Control**

* By yourself – shoot for perfect CS for as long as possible. Count the number of missed CS over 15 minutes and try to bring that number down over time.
* By yourself – stay in lane as long as possible without letting the minions touch the tower. Try it while still shooting for perfect CS, and try again without caring about CS at all (just control the lane position and CS when it’s convenient)
* Get a friend to play against and have a CS-off. No harassing (except for collateral from skillshots and AOEs), and see who gets to a benchmark first (100/150 are good bets) or who can get more in 10/15 minutes.
* 1v1 or 2v2 lane control – keep your CS up, but you lose if the minions get to your tower!
* CS under tower – this is a tricky one, especially at low champion levels. Have a friend push the wave to the tower, where you patiently wait, then CS as well as you can while the tower is shooting at the minions. See how many you can hit per wave and work on getting that up (remember, caster minions are one champ hit, one tower hit, last hit, while melee minions are two towers hits and a last hit).

**Scrims and Zoning**

* Play against a bot and practice holding good CS while harassing in between. See how much harder it is to concentrate when you’re poking? Add a second bot if you feel dicey (usually Sivir is a must for 1v1s, but add someone like Malphite or Nasus) and see how you handle being outgunned.
* 1v1 a bot without touching them. Try to avoid getting hit (since you can’t get hit back) – this is how you have to act against an aggressive lane or a lane that can outsustain you. Shoot for a new highest CS, hold lane position, and don’t die.
* 1v1 a friend with your hidden goal being to keep their CS as low as possible. Harass a ton, get them low, and force them away from the minions. You’re looking to minimize their CS while keeping yours fairly good, and trying to get ahead on levels by zoning them out or forcing them to B. Note: this doesn’t work on bots – they’re too dumb.
* Go for a no-holds-barred 1v1 or 2v2 lane scrim against friends. Anything goes, play like it’s real. For 1v1, 2 kills or first tower or most gold at 20 minutes wins. For 2v2, same deal, just make it 3-4 kills.

These are geared towards bot lane ranged AD play, but they’re applicable anywhere (except for the 2v2 scenarios).  The idea is to provide lots of isolated practice sessions for different last hitting scenarios.  You’ll need to keep it mixed up, otherwise you’ll get too used to a single situation and be uncomfortable in others.

Try one or two of these a day – you can spend less than a normal game’s worth of time drilling your last hits with various champions, and your game will improve surprisingly quickly.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_opx93,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/opx93/learning_to_last_hit_work_smarter_not_harder/,

* TankyDPS is extremely strong as are any champs that are mostly item independent; Conversely champs that require lots of farm are a bad idea.
* Control of dragon, red and the other two buff camps is extremely important and each team should feature at least one smite. It's for this reason that I used to main Nunu on the map.
* Mobility is much more important than on SR.
* Ganks happen often and fast. MIAs will be too late, watch your minimap.

My site's main asset is that it calculates tier lists on a daily basis, and it stores that information as champion rankings. Ex: Olaf is last place on the tier list -- his graph shows him as rank 114 (out of 114 champs).

While these tier lists can never be 100% correct (as tier lists are subjective in the first place), they are constructed by an algorithm that operates consistently. 

This consistency allows you analyze how recent changes have affected individual champs and lets you recognize who the 'hidden-OP' champs are. Ex: The bar on the right side picks champs that it thinks are important to follow given recent trends and placements.

I have a few questions for some seasoned ahri players out there. First,  what is the accepted build order on her? I see a lot of people rushing dfg on her for mid game assassination power.  However when I try this build I usually feel pretty weak most of the game.  I feel like I have the most sucess rushing 2 dorans and then abyssal or rabadons.  Perhaps I'm not mechanically skilled enough to dfg that fast,  bit I see almost  every pro rushing it on her. Is dfg better as a first item,  or after a few dorans and boots? Also what are some thoughts on lich bane ahri,  which I have seen on some people like mancloud and others.  I see the synergy with her ultimate,  but does it need to be there?

She's strong in bot lane, but can be great in top lane. As an ADC, she is an ambiguous pick, so even if picked early, she will often not be counter-picked by the enemy top laner.

Her kit is designed to succeed against melee bruisers: Blinding Assault's 1.5s blind lets her win short trades and avoid on-hit effects. Vault lets her maintain distance after your enemy uses his gap-closer. Vault has a very high priority so it will reliably be executed over things like Udyr's bear stance stun or Singed's fling. Heightened Senses is not a replacement for wards - its best use is against enemies who try to juke into the brush. Tag Team's immediate 80% haste with a nonexistent casting delay is a great panic button when the enemy jungler appears.

Her advantages don't work as well against mages, eg. Rumble or Swain, but she can still easily farm up.

**Skills:** In top lane, I take Vault (E) at level 1, then max Blinding Assault (Q) first, and Heightened Senses (W) second. Blinding Assault gives Quinn harass, allows her to farm from range, and lets her push creep waves quickly if necessary. Why max Heightened Senses second? For the passive: ""Tag Team: Valor gains 40/50/60/70/80% bonus attack speed."" Post-6, this lets Quinn *blitz* down towers if the enemy ever leaves you in lane with a creep wave. It's a stronger buff than Sivir's ult, and lasts twice as long. (In bot lane, I prefer to max Vault first unless I'm losing hard, as opportunities to use it for Quinn's strong Harrier AA/Vault/Harrier AA combo come up more often.)

**Runes &amp; masteries:** I run AD reds, lifesteal quints, flat armour yellows, and scaling MR blues. You'll inevitably take a couple of hits, and lifesteal quints help you prevent that harass from adding up. Masteries are 21/9/0. In bot lane I prefer to run 21/2/7 masteries for the mana regen, but the extra health and armour is important in top lane in case your opponent forces an early all-in. Top lane is incredibly snowbally, so you don't want an early disadvantage to start building against you.

**Items:** My preferred build is standard ADC: Bloodthirster, Statikk Shiv, AS boots, and a Doran's Blade along the way. I experimented with a first item BOTRK, and with BOTRK/IE instead of BT/SS, but found BT provides much more offensive presence; BOTRK felt like I was nickel and diming opponents to death. Quinn already gains a lot of free AS from her kit, specifically via triggering Harrier marks, and that complements BT. You may feel otherwise.

For starting items, lately I prefer boots/2 pots/ward. Boots allow Quinn to immediately start exploiting her range advantage over melee top laners. I don't like cloth/pots, as ideally you won't ever be taking so many attacks that you need cloth armour. Doran's Blade is another option, but it's risky with no wards or sustain; Blade is suited for an early all-in, but Quinn will probably lose a level 1-2 hard engage against a top lane bruiser/fighter.

4th/5th/6th item options include Frozen Mallet, BOTRK, Last Whisper, GA. 

Top Quinn does not work with every team. She does not replace a bulky front-liner, even with Frozen Mallet, and she is not an initiator. Quinn is more like a hybrid ranged carry/melee carry: in bird form she plays like Master Yi, a melee assassin, *not* a bruiser.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1itr7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1itr7b/top_lane_quinn/,

I prefer the latter, so here's a link for those of you who have yet to see.

http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/07/714-pbe-update.html


Anyways, I personally think that removing Runic is a good choice combined with the buffs to other MR items on PBE. Generally speaking, Armor items were very strong in terms of selfish itemization while Magic Resist was very weak. The jungler would make up for this discreptancy by rushing a Runic Bulwark and giving his whole team something like +25 MR.

With the shift on PBE towards better selfish MR items, I think it's fitting to remove Runic. What I do NOT agree with, however, is the changes to Aegis and Locket.

The changes would make Aegis no longer give any aura armor, so the net armor the jungler (or any other builder) actually gets for themselves is actually lowered. The item also gets less net MR for the user, since the base armor on the item got removed. So the resistance values on the item get nerfed from 30 to 20 armor, and 35 to 20 Mr. The icing on the cake is that Aegis also loses 50 HP. In reconciliation, they lower the price down to 2000.

Locket is getting reworked. For 600g+Aegis, your aegis gets 100 more HP, 10% CDR, and locket's shield active. (the active has the same values, I think.)

From the current locket to the new one, Locket loses 15 armor, but gains 20 aura MR. It also goes up in price, from 1850 to 2600. The item was bought on junglers due to being cheap and gold efficient. It gets more expensive and less gold efficient with the changes.

What I would like to see is for Runic to be removed, for Aegis to give less stats on its aura but more stats on the base item, and for Aegis and locket to remain separate. As a personal thing, I favor more diversity in build path, so while I can agree with the somewhat OP bulwark being removed, I dislike Aegis and Locket being ""combined"" like that. I would prefer Aegis vs. Locket to be a decision point rather than a build progression.

**TL;DR** Runic may be taken out in favor of reworking Locket into an upgrade for Aegis. Aegis loses quite a few stats in exchange for being 150 gold cheaper.

Everytime I pick him, my KDA goes into the roof. A lot of the new items are good on Rammus, he gets so much dps out of tanky items. Why isn't he in the meta? Rammus is almost impossible to kill when properly played, his pre-6 ganks are insane and he has immense chasing power.

I usually build him with a lot of auras, Abyssal Scepter is really strong on him and removes his weakness to magic damage. Combined with Sunfire Cape and his ult, he has INSANE AoE damage for the tankiness he provides. I also build Maw of Malmortius in some games, with the new Wit's End, you probably can reach decent attack speed with 225 AD (from the Armor -&gt; AD conversion) for even more damage.

Optimally, I would build him:

**Boots (whichever),
Thornmail, Abyssal Scepter,
Sunfire Cape,
Frozen Heart,
Warmog Armor**

His lane presence at level 1 is so strong thanks to Voidling harass, then you can zone opponents off the waves for a couple of levels.

**Why max Q first over E?**
1) It's safer and more efficient damage than E. You do not require a target in order to cast Q, so you don't have to push the wave. Also, fear of your Q (just the fear of it) is a great zoning mechanism in itself.

2) It's AoE. This means two things...the first being that you can potentially hit both opposing laners with it. That means more harass damage. The second being that it provides INSTANT pushing/waveclear versus the slower, single target Space AIDS option that requires you to keep killing single minions to clear the wave. This gives you more control over your lane.

3) Its CC duration scales up with ranks, all the way to 3s. A three second silence. Not even Cho'Gath has that sort of utility any more. Sure, it's a little less easy to land than Cho's, but... it will still destroy a lot of currently popular picks like assassins that rely on resets in order to get out after diving into your back line.

**So then, why W after Q?**
Around the time you start maxing W, your teams are getting into larger engages or attempting to secure objectives. W provides a lot more damage in a team fight than does E, and is GREAT for helping your team quickly clear an enemy buff camp or Dragon or Baron.

**What items?**
Well, apart from the obvious (Wards, Pink Wards, more Wards, a few mana potions, some more wards)...typically AP support fare of Morellonomicon is great. You don't necessarily need a Philo. The Faerie you may elect to start with can go straight into the Morellonomicon.

**What runes?**
Quints, you have the choice of Armor Pen, Magic Pen, Double Pen, or Ability Power.
Marks, Double Pen preferred (stronger Voidling harass.)
Seals, Armor.
Glyphs, AP or MR.

**Masteries?**
Two choices, the standard defensive-ish 1/13/16 fare, or the also standard 9/0/21 fare. 9/0/21 is for ""safer"" match-ups that don't have much CC, but if the opposing AD is an Ezreal, Caitlyn, or Draven who will likely want to auto attack you in lane, go ahead and take the safe route.

**How do I win lane as this?**
Take Q level 1, cast it, buy your items, cast it again. You can cast the third on your way to your level 1 destination if you're in a hurry, or stay in fountain to cast the third. Once the enemies approach the minion line at level 1 (if you do not engage somewhere in the jungle)...press Q at them, then start auto attacking. Your minion will just punch them for you, with power equal to your auto attacks. It's like DOUBLE THE AUTOS! Congratulations, your opponents are now stuck under their tower, likely at half health until your ADC decides to push there.

**What are weak match-ups for Malzahar support?**
Caitlyn ADC or Nunu support are some of the biggest thorns in his side. I haven't had to play against Blitz or Thresh with it, but he can likely destroy a Blitzcrank lane if you avoid the level 1 hook. Thresh is just overpowered in general right now, so he will find a way to win.

The biggest weakness Malzahar support has is the dreaded Evelynn Jungle pick. He has no ways to keep her from engaging on her ganks, and if she manages to avoid your silence, you're gonna take a beating from it.

Beyond that, a jungler that disregards the fact that you have warded your lane at level 1 and still attempts to make his presence known at level 2 will force you into a tough decision -- back off and let the opponents have the early early lane presence, or go aggro and force a 2v3 all-in, knowing you have extremely high damage output. Either way, it's a risky play that can throw the lane or greatly mitigate your early power.

**How do you play team fights as Support Malzahar? Won't they just kill you when you ult?**
That's the beauty of it. You're just a support. You can sit back on your ADC, not having to worry about dealing damage. An enemy assassin finally dives your ADC? Well good news, you press WER (smartcast, hopefully) and that assassin is going nowhere. And your ADC will be safe, and one of the two of you will likely get the kill. From there, you spam your Q and E whenever possible to try to assist/clean up any kills remaining.

**Do you seriously think this is viable?**
Absolutely. I would compare Malzahar support to Lulu (waveclear, 2.5s single target disable, good peel) or Zyra (waveclear, AoE disable, excellent peel) or Fiddlesticks (lots of silenced targets, 3s single target disable) -- all of which have good residual AoE magic damage for team fights. I'd rate him slightly weaker than Lulu or Zyra for the majority of laning, with the exception being his level 1 being far greater than theirs. His objective control is the strongest of the four, however, and some properly timed invades can mean stealing away a jungle buff from your opponents.",,False,,t5_2smhl,1372226079.0,,,True,t3_1h3av4,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1h3av4/i_enjoy_support_malzahar/,

Clearing: The clear times for me dropped thanks to increased movement speed and damage from his passive plus CDR, as well as his overall health remained higher due to the lifesteal and the biscuit on the side.

Ganking: The movement speed made it easier to get into lane plus a higher damage output, Runic Affinity meant that I usually had at least 1 buff active and the summoner spell CDR meant that ghost was more frequently up. These all made it easier to secure kills when ganking.

Teamfights: Hecari'm's teamfight potential is slightly nerfed due to the decreased tankiness and tenacity. I had to rely on items to absorb damage rather than his base stats, but this is usually the case with Hecarim anyway. However, the spellvamp on his W compensated for the missing health, and being the tank he isn't focused too hard anyway. While he is slightly weaker in teamfights, your able to complete your build faster and help your teammates through better and more frequent ganks. 

PROS:
- Stronger and more frequent ganks
- Better sustain while jungling
- CDR helps in prolonged engages

CONS:
- Less tenacity
- Slightly lower defensive stats
- Slightly weaker late game

WHEN TO USE:
I like using 0/9/21 Hecarim when there already is a bit of hard cc in the team comp, and top lane builds tanky. This way he doesn't have to be the only absorber of damage.

IS IT WORTH?
I consider the tradeoff from defensive masteries worth it because the increased strength early game means the opposing team is behind which equals less damage and that the game never really gets to the stage where defensive masteries would have been better.

I see no items that can be build by traditional toplaners (Renekton, Irelia, Jayce etc.) that are a good option now.

If they build Flask + pots they lack the ward again and lack some sort of stat and you can't build it on manaless champs like Renek and Shen. If they build any items with a ward they either lack sustain or a viable build. Basically anything you'd build on a traditional toplaner is bad in one way or another.

The only thing i can see myself play now are champs with innate high sustain like Nunu, Yorick, Zac etc. So we might be looking at the most awkward balanced toplane since the start of season 3 (Which I really enjoy as a toplaner in terms of being able to start with a ward + sustain, really making the lane less volatile and more skill-dependant)

Pros: 
* Strong ganks if you buy a shiv to push the lane

* Extremely safe lane with your stealth blink making you nearly ungankable

* great at taking enemy buffs and stealing their jungle

* can push like a demon to punish the enemy mid for leaving lane 

* gives great dragon and objective control throughout the game

* buying a cutlass into a BotRK gives you great kill potential with a q -e -active -ignite all in as the slow lets you get in those AA's while allowing you to throw the shiv for the dmg and sacrifice the permaslow

* ^^fun

* unconventional bonus: people not taking you seriously and not knowing how to deal with you

Cons:
* Squishy as all hell

* very high skillcap/learning curve

* Very little poke, relies on all ins. Risky

* the shaco lategame problem:absolutely ABYSMAL if you're not snowballing

Those are the general things off the top of my head, but I wanted to get the idea out there and see if anyone had any contributions on build/skilling

I do the standard Maxing of E first, but in lane I tend to max Q second, rather than boxes, since the boxes are much harder to use in lane, unlike in jungle where they're a great tanking/clearing tool, since the Q crit allows for better burst if you're against a squishy midlaner.

I'd probably max boxes against a tankier opponent since they'd give you more objective control and pushing power which is what you'll be focusing on if you don't have kill potential.

As for items I'd like some input, because I generally rush BotRK and then sunfire cape as a second item to get a bit beefier, boots I build completely depending on the matchup. If I'm vs a strong AP burster I go merc, against opponents I want to kill I go zerks, and against roaming lanes I go Mobility. The thing is I don't really know anything core after BotRK and SF. Shiv helps with pushing, but by your third item the magic damage bonus isn't gonna be much. I could get it first and get BotRK later, but I feel like BotRK gives so much more utility in helping you escape and chase if your deceive in on CD as WELL as the damage. Would Scimitar be good on him? I don't know. It's so expensive I've never bought it. Hydra is a great snowballing item because of the waveclear and Lifesteal it gives, but again it's so expensive I've never bought it.

I think Trundle can work very well in a 'protect the Kog' type team comp, and he has the kit to lane safely and progress on par or above many common tops.  So what does Trundle bring to a team that Olaf or Irelia or Darius or Riven doesn't?  Trundle is able to sap stats from enemies, making the enemy AD carry less threatening, or making the enemy tank/bruiser less formidable.  In a protect the kog type comp, Trundle can serve as the perfect peeler for your teams choice of AD carry.  Ragnarok+Shurelya Olaf heading straight for your Vayne?  Trundle just ult and Q while Vayne kites around your pillar until Olaf dies.  With less HP and armor, now slowed, and also dealing less damage, Vayne can just turn her attention to him and bring him down at a quick pace.  

Trundles kit is very favorable during the laning phase; innate sustain, two abilities for trading and two abilities for escaping or engaging ganks.  **Flask, pots and wards** is a great start, allowing you to remain safe from ganks and keeping you clear to farm.  Ultimately you will want to get 40% CDR so that you can spam all of your abilities in late game team fights.  Towards the end of the game you are simply a utility machine doing everything in your power to keep your AD alive and attacking.  **Frozen Heart or Iceborn Gauntlet**, depending on the situation, should always be purchased.  **Shurelya's Reverie, Locket or Zeke's Herald** are good aura items, since you will be hanging out next to your AD carry during fights, benefiting them benefits your team.  **Spirit Visage** is also a viable option if you need the MR, but it doesn't benefit your allies like the others do and the passive healing boost is an unneeded bonus.  **Randuin's Omen and Frozen Mallet** would round out my optimal build allowing you to involve yourself further in the demise of your opponents, preventing them from ever reaching your AD.  Additionally, things like **Sunfire Cape, Ravenous Hydra, Maw of Malmortius or Black Cleaver** can be purchased to up your damage or *Warmog's, Runic Bulwark or Banshee's Veil** to make you even tankier.

Vamp scep builds into BT, Hydra, Wriggles, Zekes, and BotRK. I narrowed down my choices between BT and BotRK, and went with BotRK. The active steals MS which really helps with your kiting problem, and synergies nicely with your attack speed.

As a top Kennen against a bruiser armor yellows are a clear winner, but how about mid?

I bought energy regeneration yellows as Ego Ignaxio suggests in his guide, but I found the difference between having them and not having them was very small... Kennen's skill use is more restricted by his cooldowns early on than by his energy, especially if you're not overusing lightning rush... and they also cost me way too much IP :(. Armor yellows against most AP champions aren't really worth it at least for lane phase, and scaling health yellows are OK, but I wanted to try something new, so I tried scaling health regeneration yellows.

The stats on these are as follows: .11 health regeneration/5 per level; at level 18, 1.98. 

Now, these have been usually thought of as garbage, but I'm wondering if that's truly the case. With .11 health/5*9 runes, that's roughly 1 health per 5 seconds at level 1. Ass, I know. However, at level 5, that's 5 health per 5 seconds, or 1 health per second--about 60 health a minute. At level 10, that number jumps to 2 health every second, or 120 health per minute. 

This, in addition to the regeneration mastery in the defense tree (just one point as a filler!), in addition to a Doran's shield start, in addition to 9% spell vamp from quints and masteries, seems to make for an incredibly hard to push out of lane Kennen. Just for shits and giggles I've stayed in lane until level 11 and then gone back with 6,000 gold. Harder counters like LeBlanc (against whom I start NMM/2 pots of course) are still not an easy lane, but I can really feel the impact of having these runes, as her attempts at poking me down to 70% so she can instagib me become pretty hindered by my sustain. Here's the result of a small test I did from levels 1-6 with health regen per second with this setup, including of course passive health regeneration, doran's, and the runes.

Level 1 health regen with Doran's Shield with this setup = 2.3/second.

Level 2 = 2.6/second.

Level 3 = 2.9/second.

Level 4 = 3.3/second.

Level 5 = 3.7/second.

Level 6 = 4.0/second.

Has anybody else tried these and found them to be useful? I don't want this to come across as a suggestion because despite my seeming support for these runes I'm still not sure of their effectiveness, but I'm wondering if they're used by anyone at higher ELOs, in pro matches, or to great effect anywhere really.

 Zeke's Herald affecting all five champions on a team is currently **the most gold efficient item**, costing 2145g and providing 6643g worth of stats team-wide, more than triple the value for the cost.""

well, when i read that, i got excited. i had always thought you can't rush zekes, as i thought it was only efficient when you're not alone. but now that it turns out it's efficient, and much moreso in teamfights, i'm considering it on some other champions. mainly, Ad casters that can use CDR but have a bad time itemizing for it. even though Olaf was the first champion i tried it on, i realized it might be very useful for champs like renekton and riven. with 4% cdr from masteries, cooldown boots , randuins and zeke's herald you have 39% CDR, without the possibly 'useless' stats on items like shurelya's and spirit visage. on top of that, you get armor, health and lifesteal. throw a bloodthirster and a guardian angel in there and you're set. the combination of 39% CDR, tanking stats and a lot of lifesteal seems to me a very strong combination, especially in teamfights where youre 2k item basically turns into a 6k item.

I've seen her played constantly by amateurs and pros alike, but I don't understand the appeal with her. She just doesn't seem all that strong to me.

Maybe I'm dumb and can't see what everybody else can. However, she just seems to fall short of other popular tops like Jax, Rumble, and Vladimir. She has limited sustain now, she's extremely susceptible to poke, and she's particularly easy to counter (at least as far as I can see).
 
I watched a few very recent games where TRM played her, and in every game the best he did was break even with his opponent. He never seemed to miss last hits, but his games against Rumble, Vladimir, and Nidalee were by no means easy. He was pushed to tower a lot of the time and didn't do anything special late game. My own games with her have been pretty hard as well, where I'll go up against something like a Yorick and just get poked down to 25% health by level 4. 

My question here is what everybody sees in Irelia. Is there something special I need to be doing to play her right? I never have that much trouble with other bruisers top, but my Irelia is just lacking completely. There must be something really good about her if she's this popular in the pro scene, but what is it?

His playstyle and kit both really interest me, and I'm here to explore the possibilities with you, /r/leagueoflegendsmeta/

First, here's a cheat-sheet with the lowdown on our newest archer:

* Passive: Gives 20% AS on minion kill, and 40% on Champion kill/assist for 3 and 6 seconds respectively.
* Q: Hold to charge a big-ass arrow that passes through walls/units and deals a fuck-ton of damage. Proc's W

[10 / 43 / 77 / 110 / 143 (+1.0 AD)]-&gt;[15 / 65 / 115 / 165 / 215 (+1.6 AD)] (range+damage increase as you hold Q)

* W: Passively modifies your AA's to deal bonus magic damage and mark enemies up to 3 times.  Hit a marked enemy with one of your spells to consume them and deal %maxHP damage per mark.

On-hit Damage: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26 (+0.25 AP)

Blight Damage per Stack: 2 / 2.75 / 3.5 / 4.25 / 5% (+0.01% AP)

* E: AoE damage in a circle that slows and reduces healing. Proc's W 

Physical Damage: 65 / 105 / 145 / 185 / 225 (+0.6 *bonus* AD)

Slow Percentage: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%

* R: Line skillshot snare, will spread to other nearby enemy Champions. Can fuck up teamfights.

Magic Damage: 150 / 250 / 350 (+1.0 AP)


Now, I've played Varus and I'm sure many of you have as well.  However not everyone has, and it can be confusing trying to understand just *how* you should be using Varus' kit.  To help us with this, we'll take a quick look at his base stats, which combined with his skillset should give us all the information we need to theorycraft into oblivion.

Varus Base Stats:

* Health	 400 (+82) 	        Attack damage	 46 (+3)
* Health regen.	 4.5 (+0.55)	Attack speed	 0.658 (+2.65%)
* Mana	 250 (+36)         	Armor	 13.5 (+3.4)
* Mana regen.	 6.5 (0.5)	        Magic res.	 30
* Range	 575	                        Mov. speed	 310

With everything here, I now ask you, reddit, what do you think?  I've been pondering the idea of using Varus to counter health-based Champs that lack gap-closers.  The incredible scaling on his W and his 575 range make me want to take him against Vlad or WW so bad.  Also, funny to note, is that the more direct counter to *both* Vlad and WW would be Varus' E, with the healing reduction.  However, I think that what would truly make him shine would be maxing W first and rushing a little AS, I'd love to see that burst.

* The most powerful slow &amp; attack speed debuff in the game (max rank starts at 35% and goes up to 95% over FIVE SECONDS). With max CDR this skill only has a 6.6 second cooldown, meaning only 1.6 seconds of time where the enemy AD carry should be doing significant damage. From mid to late game AD carries rule damagewise, and Nasus is one of the only champs that can almost completely shut down their damage.
* AOE armor reduction debuff (up to 40 at max level).
* Significant damage on Q IF HE GETS FARM. Big IF though.
* Ult gives him greater staying power, % health magic damage, and also increases his damage.

Now the problem that there has always been with Nasus is that he is a tough champion to pick simply because there are tons of counters for him. The enemy might send a ranged champ top, or send their AD and support to 2v1 him, and both of those choices can shut him down completely.

Basically what they are doing is nerfing the numbers on flat MR runes and buffing flat AP blues and magic pen blues and quints. Riot says this makes offensive options in mid more viable.

However, dual AP comps are really common and powerful right now and personally I see them becoming even more popular. Most non-AP top laners tend to run flat MR blues if they go against an AP top. With this nerf to flat MR and buff to flat AP, AP tops are going to be doing much more damage top lane towards non APs who might not have the burst to trade with.

**Vladimir, The Crimson Reaper** (by [Venturio](http://www.reddit.com/user/Venturio))

[Abilities and Stats](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vladimir), from the LoL Wiki.

* **Potential Roles**: AP Carry, tanky AP
* **Lanes:** Top, Mid
* **Common Item choices**: Hextech Revolved build into Will of the Anchients, Sorc Boots/Boots of Luidicity, Warmogs/Force of Nature, Deathcap, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Zhonya's Hourglass
* **Things to know**: Sustained magic damage, his pool makes him untargetable for 2 seconds, not very mobile, incredible lane sustain, weak early game
* **Beat him with**: Smart early harass, early Ignite in fights, bait pool before hard CC, stacking MR.
* **Good counter choices**: Kennen, Fiddlesticks, Ahri.

**Game Phases**

**Early game**: He uses abilities to farm - harass him when his ablities are down and deny him as much farm as possible.

**Mid Game**: Keep playing aggressive to delay his Revolver as much as possible.  Try to keep him shut down with harass and ganks to prevent him from becoming trouble.  His ult is brutal, so be careful about being too tightly grouped in teamfights.

**Late Game**: Bursting down Vlad is possible if he doesn't build any resistances. He'll have quite a bit of health if he got himself a Warmogs, so make sure to get at least two champs onto him when he's out of position.  Don't let him free farm under any circumstances, as he can clear waves very quickly.  Hard CC is his weakness, or a well-placed silence.

**General Playstyle**

* Vlad will deal (ahem) tons of damage over the duration of a teamfight if not focused.  A Vladimir should be your team's first priority target if he's fed.  Vlad can't deal a lot of burst damage until he's maxed his Q and E (level 13 at the earliest) as they have long cooldows before Rank 4
* Vlad will normally not focus a lot on harrassing early game as he needs to rush his Will of the Anchients as quickly as possible, meaning his early farm can make or break him. He'll want to play his lane passively until he feels he's strong enough. If he's a good CSer without using his Q, he'll normally use it on you if you get too close.  Remember to go after him while his Q is on cooldown
* Vlad will use his Ultimate in two situations: A teamfight where all his enemies are close together so he can hit his R on all at once, or towards the end of a fight that goes in his favour as it'll deal damage delayed by 5 seconds, often confusing/deceiving players as they run away with low health only to get killed as the damage is activated. It has a rather long CD, 150/135/120 seconds, so if he uses it in a small skirmish he won't be able to use it if a teamfight follows quickly after.
* Vlad doesn't have any real CC- his pool slows enemies by 40%, but that's it. The pool lasts for 2 seconds, so time your abilities accordingly.
* If Vlad builds a Warmog's first for whatever reason, you must work even harder to deny him CS so he doesn't get to charge Warmog's secondary ability, otherwise he'll be able to outlane just about anyone with that insane health regen and his constant use of Q on you or minions.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_rglk2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/rglk2/how_do_i_lane_against_vladimir_feat_venturio/,

Feel free to steal it or help with it.**

I was looking at [this team composition guide](http://www.lolpro.com/guides/game-play/253-game-play-guide-creating-an-ideal-team-composition) at lolpro.com. It brings up some nice points and then links to a Google Document that is helpful for planning out team compositions for premade 5's. What I wanted was a spreadsheet for planning out team compositions in solo queue (and at a lower ELO).

I have my first draft ready. I rated every champion from 0-5 in 12 different ""team composition"" areas, with the average rating being about 2. If you fill in a team composition of 5 champions, it gives you the maximum rating and the total rating of your team in all 12 areas.

**I need a lot of help** to make this usable.

**First**, I discovered while making this that I have not studied some champions very much, and I honestly am very unsure of most of my ratings of those champions. If someone could help me out with those, they are:
* Xin, Yorick, Lulu, Poppy, Evelynn, Mordekaiser, Urgot, Wukong

**Second**, I'd like specific corrections to some blatantly wrong ratings. I'm not here to ask you how well I understand the game; you can take the flames elsewhere. I'd just like most of the numbers to be approximately correct before releasing a finished version. If you see a ""1"" that should be a contender for a ""5"", let me know. If you think something is off by 1 or 2, don't bother me -- change it in your own copy.

**Third**, I'm open to suggestions for additional features or constructive feedback of any kind.

**Fourth**, you are free to steal this and modify it however you like. Choose File -&gt; Make a Copy... at the following link if you would like to do this: [Copyable Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An_CvY0-bmqudHpLM2IxcWwxMlFrekluYjh2VkVVNXc).

Finally -- please don't use the ""totals"" as an ""overall rating"" for a champion. In some sense they are an overall rating of how much team-composition-deficiency that champion can cover on their own. That doesn't mean they are ""the best.""

Obviously take them as a generalization because every jungler and matchup is going to be different. 

The way I see it, there are a few different things a jungle can do.

1. Support lanes/ Gank.
2. Farm/steal enemy camps/ deny enemy jungle. 

Do you guys go into the game with the intention of supporting the lanes? Obviously, if there is a good gank attempt open it is a good idea to take it. But if a lane is losing, how much effort will you put into helping them? If a lane is behind, and calling for help, do you leave camps unfarmed to come and help that lane? 

I was under the impression, that it is the laners job to win the lane without the jungle, and ganks are an added bonus. But if they are losing, how much time do you spend helping? 

Also there is a large cost of attempting tons of ganks. It leaves the jungle open to be stolen, also if your forced back because of low health then your whole jungle can be stolen at will. Which will eventually leave you far behind the other jungler. Do you force a gank that has a low probability of a kill or farm? 

Also say you trade even, you die and kill an enemy laner. Is this a good trade or a small net loss because your jungle can be stolen?


The other way I play is to focus of farming. Clear fast, invade often and steal what you can. Take only the good gank opportunists on the lanes. Ones where there is a decent chance of a kill or sending the guy back. This leaves the enemy jungle behind... unless he gets fed killing your lanes. Also a downside, if you clear his camps a lot he is basically forced into ganking your lanes or stand idle. I think this method is better at controlling the flow of the game, as long as your team doesn't die a bunch. 


Last questions are about the blue buff. I usually feed the blue often and early. Even with manna jungles, I give the 2nd away usually. Rarely I can give the 1st blue away but only in certain situations. For example lee sin, where you had to buy before blue doing a red start. Usually from a failed lvl2 gank. A lot of mid players will say that winning their lane is ultra dependent on the blue buff.  Do you always feed your blue to increase their chances of winning the mid lane. Obviously I don't if I think they will feed it. 

Last questions has to do the enemy blue. A lot of mid players want you to ward the enemy blue and then contest it everytime it is up. I feel like its common to start a fight at the enemy blue and it ends poorly. Is this usually worth the risk of dying or the mid being selfish? If its open to be contested and stolen, yea go for it. But do you risk a fight at their blue if its even chances of winning?

So I was watching [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYDg8tzp05w&amp;src_vid=k-lDLB_3RFw&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_314703) of Ult in Ten and disagreed with what he said at 18:30 about all AD reds/quints being the best set up (the 10 Ar Pen/10 AD mix revealed in a Reddit post a while ago is best - 6 Ar Pen reds, 3 AD reds, 3 AD quints). 

He justified his decision by pointing out the 10% Ar Pen in the masteries and I quickly thought to myself, ""But flat would be much superior until the target has *very* high armor"". 

So I set out to 'mathcraft' at what values each kind of armor pen would be best in the duo bot lane and, seeing the Soraka/Graves combo in the video, decided to start with that, a very tanky lane and thus the best scenario for percentage armor pen. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So...

-Graves starts with 15 Armor (gaining 3.2/lvl)

- 9 armor seals add 13 Armor

- 3 points in defense add 6 Armor

- Soraka's level 1 heal adds 25 Armor

- Graves' passive, when fully stacked (best case scenario, I know, but this is theory crafting for the best case scenario) adds 10 Armor (20 at lvl 6, 30 at lvl 11)

That is potentially 69 armor at level one...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After 10 armor penetration from the ideal mix [though if you knew you were going up against this combo, you'd hope that you had a full armor pen page (By full I mean reds and quints; 25 armor pen)], you have 59 armor. 

After the 10% armor pen from the masteries, that's still 53 armor.

Using the application of armor formula: (100/100 +armor) X 100 = percentage of damage you take from physical sources) - (100/153) * 100 = You 65.4% of damage from physical sources. Wow.

With 25 Armor pen (all reds and quints) -

69 - 25 (Flat Armor Pen) = 44

44 X .9 (10% Armor Pen) = 39.6

(100/145.9)  * 100= You take 71.6% of damage from physical sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now obviously, there are conditions to have this amount of armor (Graves has to have been in combat for 10 seconds and not leave combat for more than 3 seconds; Soraka's heal/armor buff lasts for 5 seconds), but *still*. It is **ridiculous**.

TL;DR - Might want to have a 'full' Armor Pen page handy for a Soraka/Graves lane in draft; get ready to cry if you see that lane in blind pick. 

Don't waste your time trying to fight them in lane when Graves has many stacks of his passive and/or when Soraka heals him; they'll win the trade.

You can fall behind easily in levels, you will be easily followed in the jungle by the support, and a good enemy jungler will be able to take your buffs and keep the timer on blue for his mid to take.

1369068965.0,16,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1epbpf,Overlooked starting item build for Mid Laners right now,ModaFcknBackup,23,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1epbpf/overlooked_starting_item_build_for_mid_laners/,"If you go 9-0-21 on mids (best on mids like Lux,Twisted Fate,Ryze, Zyra, Ahri, Basically all AP mids) you can start Boots and 5 pots. I tried this out, and while you might not feel the strength of this start, but it really does help. 
This is what I was thinking: http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#73K7vwdPgvpl7A

Counter arguements: 

1. 9-0-21 is bad/not very strong. I really don't think 9-0-21 is bad, I barely feel the difference in damage. The spellsword mastery and 3 points of flat AP in the offense tree, really feel like a total waste to me even while running, 21-0-9. AP mids really lack variety in the Offense tree, in my opinion, I mean it feels like its either spellsword and 3 into flat AP, or butcher is the only other option. I think 9-0-21 really opens up some variety in the mid lane.
2. Riot buffed base movement speeds, I don't really need boots. Extra movement speed is a stat that is useful on EVERY single champion in the game. If you take a look at runes as an example, running ms quints  on a champion can never be a bad thing. Another thing, that I really kind of like is that it's much easier to dodge skillshots, which in the mid lane is critical (ex: lux, anivia, ahri, zyra). Also lets you move around in lane quick to get cs that you might normally miss. Movement speed also lets you roam alot, much more efficiently. 
3. Why 5 pots, that much sustain isn't necessary? Riot tried nerfing red pot and limiting potions, to create a more balanced start, on PURPOSE. If you have ever faced a Lee Sin,Katarina,Kennen,Zed,or Vlad mid, who started 9 hp pots and 2 wards(kat kennen vlad)/Red pot 4 hp pots and a ward (lee sin zed kha zix jarvan, etc.) its completely obnoxious. Getting the best of both sustain and ward vision is too good. I believe while this start lacks vision (unless you go explorer ward) its still almost as strong as those builds.

Another thing I think might be decent, is maybe and ADC MID (with lifesteal quints) running 13-0-17. Here is a link of what I was thinking: http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#ZMUvSwdmgM76r
Starting maybe doran's and 1 hp pot, while having 9% lifesteal (again with lifesteal quints) is a lot sustain.The strat would be to pick someone like caitlyn, and then push the other mid out of lane and/or outsustain him, then try taking tower as quickly as possible (thats the reason for the point in destruction).

Please tell me what you guys think of all this!

TL;DR 9-0-21 masteries open up the option of starting with Boots and 5 pots in mid lane, a build which (imo) is quite strong.

Edit: The cooldown masteries also help alot, especially since almost every mid in the current meta scales really well with cooldown reduction.

My standard build is usually Golem Spirit, Frozen Mallet, Aegis/Locket (Prefer Locket for the CDR, have to discuss with support who builds which), and then situational items depending on the comp (Maw for double AP if I didn't get Aegis, Black Cleaver if I'm tanky enough, GA/Warmogs if not). For boots I get Ninja Tabi if I need the passive/armor, otherwise I get Mobility Boots to gank faster.


I like stacking HP on Vi because it makes her passive stronger, which has saved my life countless times (350-400 HP shield every 8 seconds is a lot). I've found this build to be quite successful so far in solo queue (15-3 in Gold IV mmr). Instead of maxing W for the attack speed and jungle clear, I max Q then E for the cool downs; getting an extra vault breaker can turn a normally failed gank into a kill.


I don't have much difficulty securing kills in ganks or team fights, even with my only damage coming from runes and Frozen Mallet. I run 9/21/0 masteries and my runes are AD reds, Armor yellows, MR/level blues, and AD or Move Speed quints (AD if I have Janna support or the enemy has low mobity, move speed if I need it). 


In team fights I feel like I can do more than just jump on the carry, and deal as much damage as possible before I get bursted to 0. Aside from not nuking the enemy, what drawbacks are there to playing Vi like this? My build covers most utility needed to initiate/tank/dive because I've covered almost every defensive stat I could want (tenacity, hp, armor/mr, cdr, permaslow). My passive can take 2-3 turret shots before the turret can even touch my hp, and when combined with locket, I can shield most damage the enemy team deals to me in team fights.


My questions are simply how effective am I really being with this build. How would you counter me if you played against me while I used this strategy? What is the downside to sacrificing damage for utility? Am I just pubstomping or is this build Vi-able?

I know that its best to rush a BT, but beyond that I'm sorta stumped.   

Right now my favorite build is BT &gt; merc treads or berserker's greaves &gt; BT &gt; wit's end &gt; tanky or more BT's

This isn't building any crit, though- another good one could be BT &gt; boots 2 &gt; Statikk Shiv &gt; IE.
Or perhaps BT &gt; sheen &gt; boots 2 &gt; trinity force? 
Sword of the divine? Phantom dancer? BotRK?

Also, should I be building any armor pen on AD thresh? My instinct is that I should just build some tanky items instead of last whisper since he's mixed damage. In fact, I should probably be getting a giant's belt early on in any game...right after BT and boots perhaps?

Also, has anybody done testing on how exactly his q (soon to be e) passive works? From a little bit I think I've determined that there is a smooth damage gradient over the 8 seconds, but hitting right away gives more damage than you'd expect if it were a linear increase. This suggests that there's some base value based on AD in addition to the souls value.

Data collected: 8-91 against 2 MR: 90 red 69 yellow 56 green 35 blue. But it didn't seem to be set by color alone- it varied slightly, so there was probably a smooth gradient based on time

Caution, I might be a little biased in this article towards how bad of a spot he's in.  I still have good games every so often with him, but I feel like it's only because of how well I play him and I feel like almost every match is an uphill battle.  I play him top, mid, and solo bottom.  He was an absolute monster in season 2 when the early MR mid phase kicked in and he was still able to deal damage in spite of that.  Then they nerfed his Q, nerfed flat MR runes, nerfed all MR items, and buffed Penetration as a whole while encouraging health stacking and increasing base movement speed so that any champion who is skilled at playing against Galio can dodge his Q's without boots, where before I could hit them 100% of the time without boots.

No champion (okay, I might be overstating here) was hit so hard by season 3 nerfs to the point where they are virtually unplayable in their current incarnation at any Elo above 1400.  It's that bad (I'm a chronic exaggerator).  Enemies that used to drop quickly and easily are now building more health and sustain, enemies that used to not deal much damage can rush pure Magic Penetration with Guise getting a new item built out of it and +Pen going after %Pen.  Galio is just in a rough spot because itemization no longer rewards his passive as much and itemization counters his passive heavily.

Now, I won't pretend that season 3 has been all bad for him.  The change to his Q (Lower mana cost, lower CD, lower base damage) has opened up Sheen and Iceborn as excellent alternatives against AD assassin mids after Chalice.  Iceborn also makes Galio's auto-attacks worthwhile between his spells.  But the good feelings of discovering that the most heavily nerfed season 3 item has some synergy left me wishing I had discovered it earlier.  Especially when it comes to a choice between rushing that or RoA, where RoA does so much for Galio.  But now we have no MR, so the passive is getting wasted and we just have a mediocre caster with a good ult.  And with Iceborn Galio also has no health.  I just feel like it's making things pretty difficult since he needs a finished item so badly.

Galio's ultimate is countered by a lot of champions like Udyr, Kha'zix, Irelia, Xin, Blitz, Garen, many of which are still popular choices.  I'm finding it really difficult to keep up when playing as Galio between all of these issues.  Especially Kha'zix.  Fuck him.  I ult him when he has no tenacity and for some reason he can jump out of it before it's done.  -_-  Bad champion design on Riot's part for both champions.  With the gap-closer meta in full swing, Galio's slow and speed boost kit isn't cutting it anymore.  Especially with multi-dashes (Renek, Kass, Nid, Gragas), big dashes (Akali, Kat, Kha'Zix), and flash.

1. Lane ganks are significantly stronger. The lane gank itself is often overlooked by many players in my experience. In my opinion, lane ganks are strongest against the adc/support lane (usually bot lane). This is because the other entrances for ganking are often warded giving the enemies a false sense of security, especially if they are pushed to the tower. Depending on your jungle/support combo, a lane gank with Ghost when the enemy is pushed to the tower is practically a guaranteed double kill given you are not counterganked. The risk of the lane gank is that you can get counter-ganked by opposing junglers waiting in the lane bushes to do their own gank.

2. Ghost has a lower cooldown than Flash.

3. Ghost allows you to stick to the enemy carries more easily in temfights. This does not apply to every champion, only to tanky mofos rather than squishy assassins like Kha'Zix or Zed. 

Cons:

1. Ghost can't get you out of certain sticky situations that Flash can. This also goes for chasing down the enemy.

2. Flash might be a better initiation tool in some cases. An initiation with Ghost is much more predictable and takes longer. 

Junglers who I think are better with Ghost: Hecarim, Olaf, Volibear, Nasus, Trundle, Dr. Mundo, Jax, Rengar, Shen

Junglers who I prefer to run Flash on, but Ghost should be considered for certain team comps: ~~Vi~~, Xin Zhao, Maokai, Shaco, Darius, Wukong, Nautilus, Gangplank, Riven

Just as a quick note, and I'm sure most, if not everyone, knows this, **SV does not effect the health gained from his ult.**

Now, while the health, cdr, and mr are all great on Renekton, I know people also buy it for the unique effect, and I think a lot of assumptions are being made. I KNOW it's not built on renekton purely for the passive, but that's the part I want to focus on. *(I've actually stopped buying it on him, but this is pretty much for a different reason entirely).***

The first thing to note, is that Renekton's Q has a hard cap for the heal. http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Renekton

This is the big question: is SV constrained by this cap? If not, great, no further questions are really needed at this point, but I see no reason to assume that it isn't.

If it is, then in what situations does Renekton hit this cap? How much more AD would yield similar results to the passive on SV? Does it's effectiveness change when you compare a furied Q to non furied?
 
People casually talk about the synergy between the passive on SV and Renekton, but I've recently started to pose some questions for which I do not have answers. I find that the current form of the game makes testing these things a real pain in the ass and is just imprecise. I was wondering if any of you guys had any answers.

For example, in some pro gameplays, I see alot of MF and Ezreal in the same game and I'm wondering which one counters which?

My support picked Karma, and not being too familiar with Karma, I just went with my guts and chose Cait. My support kept going on how Ezreal counters me and I got really confused and didn't understand how or why. Turns out that Ezreal did counter me and we lost the lane. I do now, sortof understand how Ezreal is stronger than Cait in certain areas during laning.

Who does Varus, and Draven counter?

This is more a thought I had. Taric has some pretty damn good stuff in his kit. His passive gives you mana back (a percentage of your damage dealt) and his Q cooldown goes down when you auto attack. These two things tell me that some attack speed and damage on him could net you a large amount of mana, and really low cooldowns on his heal. These two things make me think that he could be pretty decent top lane. He's got sustain, he's naturally resistant to AD from his W, he has a stun to secure kills and to help your jungler gank. The only downside to this build is his damage from his abilities will be rather low. On the flip side I'm pretty sure a taric with AD will be pretty damn awefull to fight.

Second thought was spawned more by recent AP Kayle discussions. If you get max CDR on Taric you have his ult up every 30 secs odd. Tac on 400 - 500 AP and suddenly his abilities are hitting for a ton.

I was thinking:

CDR Boots
Rabaddons
Rylai's
Spell Pen staff
Lichbane
Liandri's

The problem I've always had in games is deciding what to build on her. I believe she has one of the most flexible builds in the game due to her kit and how she's designed. 

She can make use of pretty much anything: AD (Q and R), AS (W and R), AP (Q, E), MS (E and chasing), Armor and MR (to survive after R in a fight), lifesteal and spellvamp (Q and E get 100% effect of spellvamp), CDR (...everything!), HP (surviving after R, technically it has negative synergy with her passive but it's important), mana (dat tiny mana pool), crit (R), and penetration (especially MPen). 

So that leaves so many options open. The more i look at the items we have now and changes that have been made the more I get indecicive about what to buy. For example, SotD is great because dat burst if she get the 3 hits off with her R up. The new DFG is great for the same reason, just ult someone, DFG and then combo. With Q's cooldown you should be able to get 2 Q's in, though I don't know if the %HP damage is amplified. Iceborn gauntlet is great, sticking power and tankiness with dat sheen. Zephyr is great (the tenacity means you can buy tabi and go to town on the ADC safely). Trinity and gunblade are still crazy good on her.

I'm guessing Perseverance (HP regen) is something you'll want to skip for most champions. Possibly good on Olaf or Voli, maybe some others?

How does Unyielding / Block (flat champion damage reduction) stack up with the other options? 5 damage is massive early-game. Being champion-specific is a significant nerf from S2, though. Are there any situations where I won't want this mastery?

When should I take Relentless / Tenacious (tenacity) as opposed to Juggernaut / Legendary Armor (% HP, % armor / MR)? Should I bother with Relentless at all? If I have to pick two out of those four masteries, what should I take?

How does Reinforced Armor (reduced crit damage) stack up against the competition?

Most Defense masteries have weird stats per point increases. They often give more stats for the first point invested than any points after that.

Here are a few cool things I have seen:

-Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra on Udyr: In turtle stance the damage from the splash counts toward the ""restores a % of your damage as mana."" The difference between his regular attacks and the splash from tiamat is pretty huge when clearing camps. You could probably grab this item and spam stances while never worrying about mana again. Of course it's arguable that you would want to get a pure damage item on him, but it's still pretty neat. 

Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra + new Avarice Blade (grants bonus gold on kills) on Gangplank: Much to my delight I discovered that Gangplank's Q and Avarice Blade grant bonus gold when you kill multiple minions with the splash damage from Tiamat. Supposedly it refunds half mana for every kill from the splash as well, though I didn't specifically check that when I was trying it out on him so I don't know for sure. 

Tiamat/Ravenous Hydra on Nasus: This falls into the ""bad"" category. Based on my Tiamat Gangplank experience, I assumed Nasus's Q would work the same way, i.e. I assumed killing multiple minions with a Q+Tiamat splash would grant him bonus Q damage from every kill. Hydra is even in his recommended items, which further reinforced my suspicion. Unfortunately it does not. This actually seems like a terrible item to get on him since it destroys your ability to control how quickly the minions die, so I don't know why they put it in his recommended items. 

-Banner of Command (gives AP, armor, health regen aura, nearby minions deal 15% bonus damage, promote active) on Elise: I was confused about seeing this in her recommended items, so I bought it out of curiousity and found out that the % minion damage bonus affects her spiderlings! Presumably it should affect anyone with a pet, so you could stack Yorick, Zyra, and Elise on the same team and only one of them would need to buy it to benefit from the aura.

-Captain boot enchantment (increases movement speed of nearby minions, allies gain movement speed when moving toward you) on Elise/Yorick: I thought this enchant looked a bit underwhelming, but after finding out that Banner of Command affected pets I thought this one might too. Turns out it does affect pets, which is great because Elise's spiderlings have a really low base movement speed. I could see it being pretty scary on Yorick too since his ghouls are already difficult to dodge.

Edit on this: after playing her a few more times I noticed her spiderlings have a really weird interaction with movement speed. They show a really low MS when sitting still, then they gradually scale up to her movement speed once she starts moving. With captain boots they will bounce back and forth between faster and slower to keep pace with her. Based on that you're probably better off with Furor or Alacrity on her for more sticking power, since the spiderlings will be as fast as you when you're moving. 

-Black Cleaver (shreds a % of armor on enemy champions when you deal physical damage) on Jarvan IV: Not only does this synergize with the % armor shred from his Q, but because his passive deals bonus physical damage seperately from the main attack, he gets two stacks of the debuff on his first attack. Also, because the splash from Tiamat/Hydra is physical, the Black Cleaver debuff is applied to everyone who gets hit by the splash damage. Get both of these items if you want to demolish the enemy team's armor!

As far as stats go, Scimitar is more expensive, but provides better stats - but at the point in the game you'll be buying I don't think 610 gold is a deciding factor in your itemization.

Looking at build paths, Maw may have the advantage because it is made up of more affordable components than Scimitar, but the latter's components have an active built into one of them; both have an intermediate item that serve a similar purpose to the one you are aiming to build (what I'm trying to say here is that Maw is cheaper, but I think Scimitar has greater value due to the Quicksilver active).

As far as passives go, I think it's hard to argue (although it can be done) that Quicksilver is the more useful option - there may be clutch shield saves (however anecdotal the evidence may be), but a free cleanse is hard to beat. And from the mathcrafting I've read, the bonus AD is meh, but I don't remember precisely what the impact is (so if I'm incorrectly minimizing its effect, I'm sorry).

Will Maw continue on as a purely bruiser item and Scimitar a choice for carries, or will the latter simply outshine the former and make it an inferior choice?

Mid game in the early fights he just out damages me so it's impossible to fight him when he dives on me. I'm not sure if I can fight him late game either since he probably has Randuins which cripples my DPS even with last whisper. I'm mostly talking about when playing Ezreal or some other non-hyper late game carry.  
  
 My last game on EZ I did fine in lane, 2 kills ahead of their carry, ahead of Olaf in CS and he's not looking too big until we team-fight for dragon at around 17 minutes. He just decimates me and the rest of my team, despite my fizz being 7 kills up and taking out their carries. I decide to pick up LW to try and deal with him but I just can't out DPS him and obviously my whole team is spamming ping on their carries while I'm stuck trying to kite (VERY slowly) this olaf.  
  
So in the last team fight at around 30-35 minutes my items are - LW, Trin force, Zerks, Double Dorans and a Pickaxe. A total of 9,205 gold
  
His are Tabbi, Randuins, Wriggles, Aegis and Maw. A total of 10,750 gold. So not a huge difference in gold.   
  
Am I itemizing wrong?   
 
Should I stick to Trinforce/BT even if they have an Olaf who is just diving onto me?  
  
Should I have picked up GA immediately after trin force?   
 
Do I sacrifice early game dominance and not pick up dorans blade?

I've looked and learned about Korean meta and such, but they're basically the same method as the current EU style. 

I've been thinking about this for longest while, but I couldn't figure out anything that would be absolutely better than the 'solo top; solo mid; duo bot; jungler' which we are currently following. 

So I am here to discuss with you redditors of any potential new meta. 

I've seen the TSM and some other teams trying duo top and solo bot, but that's just reversing the EU style, not anything new. 

What I have in mind are:

 Meta 1
 - Traditional solo top
 - Traditional solo mid
 - Solo bot adc 
 - Two junglers each covering one side of the jungle (red/blue)

 Explanation : Yes, of course the 2v1 lane could be obliterated, but with two junglers roaming around, there will be so much pressure added on top and mid. Seeing as the ad carry is usually the one who puts out the most damage late game, this can seem irrational, however, with an additional jungler replacing the support spot, it'll be a lot easier to stick to the enemy ad carry and nullify his presence during teamfights. Also, the potential of extreme couterjungling cannot be ignored. Imagine you're playing mid and there are shyvana and nautilus coming from each side of your lane.

The reason why I came up with this idea was that many new junglers don't even need the first blue buff (Shyvana, Rengar, Lee Sin, etc, although Lee is not comparatively new) So we let them take the red side of the jungle, and send our old junglers who need first blue (Amumu, Nunu, etc) to the blue side. 

The down parts of this meta is that it pretty much relies on early game dominance on top and mid lanes. If the team can't stop the farmed ad carry of the enemy team, the late game will be heavily favored on the traditional EU style comp. 

 Summary:

Pros: - Lots of pressure on top and mid lane
- Strong objective controls (buffs, dragon, baron)
- Strong map control and possible counterjungling
- Will have another bruiser instead of a support
- Double Aegis madeeasy

Cons: - Miserable bot lane
- Junglers won't be fed enough if ganks/counterjungling aren't successful because they will be sharing the jungle resources
- Weaker late game teamfights if the enemy adc isn't shut down enough during teamfights. 

 Meta 2
 - Traditional bruiser top
 - Old AD carry mid
 - AP Carry or AP Bruiser bot
 - Traditional Jungler
 - A roamer that doesn't really need cs to pull off its effectiveness (i.e.  Alistar, Blitzcrank, Nautilus

 Explanation: There are many AP casters known for their superior waveclear abilities from a safe distance (i.e. Gragas, Twitsted Fate, Brand, Anivia) The roamers will start off as supporters and stay bot until the AP caters are strong enough to clear waves without taking too much turret damage and harass. Afterwards, they will leave bot and start roaming to gank lanes. This way, we will still have the strong ad carry late game and still have the early game presence over the whole map.

Summay:

 Pros: - Bot lane won't be as destroyed as in the meta 1
- Can keep up in overall cs better compared to meta 1
- Strong presence all over the map
- Will not fall off late game, still keeping the early game dominance.
- Chance to instagib the enemy adc at level 6 and snowball after on.  
- Better CC overall (since the roamers would be naut/alistar/blitz, so on)

Cons: - If the enemy solomid is a big time nuker like LeBlanc or Annie, the AD carry can be deleted off the map in a split second at level 6
- Only certain champions can fill the solo bot role (Anivia, Brand, Gragas, etc)
- If roaming fails, the roamer will significantly fall behind in level/gold
- Can be shut down by proper warding.
- If you're blue team, the AP caster stays too far from the blue buff, forced to get chalice or leave the lane for a long time.





This is all I can think of for now. I'd love to hear your creative ideas and and tweaks that can be made to the current style or my metas.

I was recently thinking about promote and where it would be viable/really good. I've only ever seen it once or twice in summoners rift when they first released it. I was thinking of good places to use it:

Basically what I came up with is using it to push very very quickly. Against mids that rely on roaming a lot, such as leblanc it is a great tool if you can keep them under their tower the whole laning phase/push the tower down quickly to start roaming yourself. 

I could see it as a hard counter to anivia; it would push the lane to the tower incredibly fast forcing Anivia to waste a ton of mana just to kill creeps.

I think it would also work really well as a roaming champion against someone who has a hard time last hitting under turrets. Pushing to their turret will give you ample time to gank another lane, such as leblanc who has horrendous wave clears, but excels at ganking other lanes.

Possibly if you are running a backdoor Yi or shen, TF something like that it would help push down waves/towers much faster. Although, other summoners are more useful, and generally a backdoor yi will be jungling so not sure how well that would work out. 

Obvious drawbacks to this:

*reduces your kill potential in lane
*Other summoners offer more utility (ignite/exhaust/heal)
*Doesn't offer anything for team fighting ",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_vzye9,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/vzye9/theory_crafting_uses_for_promote/,

Here's a possible setup based on the current state of the game:

* Ranged AD top - Graves, Cait, Corki, someone with good escapes and range.

* AP carry mid - anyone.

* Tanky jungler - Nautilus, Udyr, Shyvana, Mundo, Skarner, Trundle

* Aggressive support bot, someone with damage + CC - Lux, Janna, Shen

* Melee AD carry bot

A sustain support like Sona or Soraka would probably be too passive to deal with harass, while someone like Alistar, Leona or Blitz are too situational - in between their big plays (which can be missed), the melee AD would get zoned. In HoN/DotA, the support for a melee carry is typically very aggressive, able to constantly harass and nuke the opponent to give the carry room to breathe. CC to facilitate ganks and lane kills. I think Lux would be ideal for this but the others mentioned could work.

An alternative to this setup would be putting the AD mid, which is arguably even safer (and all of the ones I mentioned can do it) and also has the added benefit of being able to pile on harass (most APs aren't stacking armor). Meanwhile, the top champ becomes either an AP bruiser like Rumble or Chogath, with jungle being basically anything.

Having a hardcore bruiser bot along with a very aggressive support that does not take creep. (Think alistar/ yorick bot lane) This allows, also, for lots of roaming to take place.

Ap mid, bruiser/tank jungle.

Advantages to this: AD carry gets to farm for a very long, undisturbed period of time.

Bot lane can better protect dragon due to inherent tankiness in most bruisers.

Highly aggressive bot lane can catch ad carries by surprise and shut them down early

Does not hinder jungle ability and allows for more roaming from supports due to bruisers being (mostly) able to take care of themselves. 

Disadvantages: AD carries would be rather limited to those that either counter sustain or have very effective escapes (Trist, graves, possibly vayne) 

Bot lane would be a 1v2 for a large portion of the laning phase assuming that the ""support"" is roaming properly.

If your enemy has 15 minions close to him, and you only have 5, he will likely win the trade, because those 10 minions will start attacking you. This is why trading under your own turret doesn't work well (even though the turret will attack them if they are in range), because normally if you're pushed to your turret that means the enemy has more nearby minions. Also, the minions do have to be within a certain range to trade, so again, if you're at your tower trying to trade with an enemy, you're likely going to be on top of his minions, while yours will be out of reach of the enemy. If your lane is even, try to trade closer to your caster minions if possible as well.

Also, if you're not an autoattacker, and instead are an AP caster, and it's earlygame, don't autoattack if at all possible. non-targeted spells do not aggro minions (if I'm not mistaken, targeted spells don't either) but autoattacks do.

Top: Bruiser, occasionally a mage
Middle: Typically an AP champion
Jungle: Anyone who can clear the jungle with reasonable ease.  CC or gap-closers tend to be preferred for ganking.
Bottom: Typically a ranged AD champion and a support.  A support is any champion who can aid their lane partner without the help of too many items.


Now, back to the title, when I say proven tactics, I mean anything that falls outside of the aforementioned metagame and has worked consistently.  This could be an overarching team strategy (AoE, for example), an unusual counter-lane (Tryndamere mid vs Kassadin, for example), or even something like a unique item choice (Tiamat on Twitch, for example).

I thought it would be good for this subreddit to collect unconventional strategies that have consistently worked for us into one thread.

To start us off, some of the tactics that have worked consistently for me are:

Duo kill lane:  I've been playing a support kill-lane since DotA; a friend and I used to run Lina Inverse (a heavy nuker) and Crystal Maiden (CC-heavy support) and we only lost with it once to another duo lane that was absurdly beefy and had huge early-game damage mitigation and output (Axe and Death Knight).  Bringing this over to DotA our most successful kill lane is Leona/Wukong.  This has also been proven by Goose's success in running Leona/Jarvan.

Farming Jungle + Leblanc mid:  Leblanc does a poor job of farming minions, but a great job of killing champions.  Because of her slow farming, some potential is lost early game.  Leblanc can choose to go gank and miss farm, or farm and then miss gank opportunities.  The solution I came up with for this and my team implemented was to play a jungler who could effectively clear waves when we played a Leblanc mid.  This way when LB wanted to go gank, the jungler would go take his lane over so the exp/gold didn't get wasted.  You only implement this after Leblanc has already killed the champion in her lane, otherwise this strategy becomes redundant and LB just becomes a roamer without farm and your jungler just stays in lane actually causing you to lose exp/gold.

1. When your side of the jungle is cleared and you aren't able to safely clear the other side, do you go into lane or wait for a single camp to respawn?

2. What makes an amazing jungler instead of a good one?

3. At my ELO there isn't often a jungler on either team in normals. If I do choose to jungle and put a lane at a 2v1 disadvantage, how do I make it up if it's unsafe to gank that lane?

4. How do I avoid being blamed for everything in solo queue even if I do everything correct? 

5. Since junglers seem to always get less CS than they would in lane, is it wise to grab a gp10 item early on (if it's not part of your build)?

6. When do I stop jungling? I know it's foolish to sit in there for a long time, but (aside from buff and dragon control) is it based on getting levels fast and then leaving when everyone is done their farming phase, or catching people out of position while in the jungle?

1376194545.0,19,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1k4md4,"Why exactly is Veigar a ""bad"" pick? Would like some feedback please!",xRonbo,24,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1k4md4/why_exactly_is_veigar_a_bad_pick_would_like_some/,"**Warning: Wall of text, feel free to just respond to the tl;dr**

Background:

A long time ago, I mained Veigar (like, levels 1-15). Since then, I have never played him. Today in ranked, I saw a guy (westbound43) playing Veigar in a featured ranked game. He's Plat 1. After watching that match, I decided to try out Veigar again, and it went very well (18/0 with him in Silver 1 ranked &amp; hadn't played him in almost a year). My second match went equally well (13/0). Both matches were against counters (Blue Ezreal mid = no AP, Ryze mid) so it's not like I was against an AP stacker. I've played him in quite a few normals since then to work on pure mechanics, and all have gone equally well.

Anyways, now that I think about it, why is Veigar almost always considered to be a troll pick? I feel like he's similar to the old Nasus in terms of reason for being unpopular, but his kit is considerably better. 

Pros:

- Infinite Q farming, though it won't typically go over 200

- W buff a while back means you can land it with a level 1 stun

- Giant AoE long-lasting stun

- 1.2 AP ratio + high base damage on ult means that the 0.8 AP scaling off of the enemy AP isn't even necessary, invalidating the whole ""people will just pick an AD mid"". Case in point: At 25 minutes a Veigar can easily have ~1k base damage on ult. Sure, it does more to AP champions, but it's still going to be hitting pretty hard on everyone else.

- 100% ratio on W

- Passive + Flat Mana Regen Seals helps a lot with early mana issues

I'm not going to list cons since that's pretty much what I'm looking for.

This is my typical game:

Early - Focus on CSing, with the occasional last-hit with Q since last hitting every time it's up makes me go OOM very quickly. Use E to avoid ganks (I can usually land my stun on both of them). 

Level 6 - Harass with 2 or 3 Q's, then insta-kill. So far I haven't gone against any real tanky mids, but there aren't really many tanky mids in the meta right now anyways. I've been able to one-combo Zed, Talon, and an Ahri with Negatron with no issues.

Mid-game - Begin roaming, mostly bot lane because I can often kill the support in one combo with no ult (just Q+W). Go for a kill every time ult is up.

Late-game - Just wander the map and catch people off guard. Progress to the point where I can one-hit anyone on the enemy team.

My build is:
Dorans+2 -&gt; Haunting Guise + Sorc Boots -&gt; Rabadon's -&gt; Void Staff -&gt; DFG.

I think the main difference here is my late DFG. In my experience, having 2x MPen items combined with a Blasting Wand is enough to kill any mid/ADC/support that point in the game. Void Staff does more than a DFG IMO, but the DFG afterwards is helpful for the CDR and obviously the bonus damage. Basically I feel like the DFG bonus is overkill until later in the game. I rush Raba instead to maximize my Q bonus and sheer burst.

I also run Magic Pen Quints + Flat Mana Regen Seals, which are somewhat unusual I suppose.

A big reason that people tend to give is that Veigar doesn't do anything except insta-gib one person. But in Solo Queue, isn't that great? I mean, not every mid can take out even one person in a fight. Shouldn't being able to have a 90% chance of opening the fight with a kill be a good thing? Also, with max CDR or even 33% (blue buff + DFG + masteries), Veigar's cooldowns are pretty low - easily on par with other mid laners. Having a 100% ratio AoE nuke on a 6 second cooldown (W) is pretty strong, and a giant AoE stun is easily a fight changer.

So based on all of this, can you give me some good reasons for Veigar's low preference in solo queue?

I don't usually build it, but when I'm up against a kill lane (say j4+lee or so) I'm inclined to pick up some parts of the item early on, and finish randuins as a third item (or even second if I go for a dorans-heavy start or so).

Thoughts? If you think it's a fine item, what situations would you most likely build it in, and at what point in your buildpath?

I've been trying to work up a list of all the good solo hard laners, but I'm quite limited by experience as I see a lane swap maybe one out of every 20 games in ranked.

So far I've found that in order to be a good solo hard laner you need all of:
 
 - AoE wave clear
 - Sustain
 - Escape
 - Generally hard to kill

From that I've gotten this extremely incomplete tier list:

 - Tier 1 has everything -- Kayle, Shen, Renekton

 - Tier 2 is missing one -- Jayce, Twisted Fate, Zed, Lulu, Caitlyn, Graves, Lissandra, AoE mages with an escape

 - Tier 3 is missing two -- Varus, Garen, Kennen, Lux, Syndra, Diana, Vladimir, AoE mages without an escape

 - Tier F simply doesn't have AoE clear -- Ezreal, Kassadin, Rengar, LeBlanc, everyone else

I've found that everyone Tier 2 and down can still be screwed over by a 1v2 swap they weren't expecting if they go for any starting item that isn't loaded with sustain. Example: grabbing a Doran's Blade on Jayce will drop him to tier 3, but starting Flask+3 will make him a very solid 1v2 laner.

Hmmm with the new  buff, it looks like a pretty solid items to AS/AP champs. It's obviously good on Teemo, Kayle and Diana.


Who else would it be good on ? Let's assume the max AP 600 ( to avoid problems and easier damage calculation ) and I assume you take the 5% on masteries so. 20% of AP + 15.


I want to test it on TF. 135 ish extra damage per hit. Works well with cards as well. It's no lichbane though. 

- Pick a card scales by 40% @600 ap its 240 damage. and Nashor is about half of that.

- 240 + 135 + 45 from gold = 420 + lich bane 600 = 1020 

- 1020 damage vs ~900 isnt even that much but when you look at it 

- 420 vs 285 is a lot (IMO)

I want to try this on elise as well. The CD, AP, and damage works pretty well. with her spiders. 

Lulu - seems pretty bad ass with this too. 

Ori - might be a pretty good choice i wouldn't know. her auto attacks already hurt sooo much -___- but the chances of you auto attack though late game... Burst VS AA trade off.

AP TRYN - would have a huge spike in AA damage when lichbane is down.

AP CHO - AA damage.

Uydr - CD, AS, AP, ""AD"". huge damage !!

I am a gold 3 player who has recently had some success running cleanse on mid lane Ahri, and wanted to know what other summoners thought about cleanse on mid laners. My reasoning is as follows:

* Most mid laners take ignite, and cleanse allows you to nullify this, as well as be used if you are getting ganked, exhaused in a teamfight, or caught by a CC in a teamfight. 

* Against certain midlane champions (ex Cass, Annie, Veig, Lux, etc), getting pegged with a CC can almost guarantee your death. 

* Certain mid laners either have enough burst or cc midgame to ensure a kill if they land their combo, even without ignite (ex LB/Ahri). If you find your damage lacking by taking cleanse, you can always buy a DFG to make up for this. 

* Lategame midlaners (ex AP Kog, Karthus) can do significant damage lategame without the aid of ignite, and cleanse helps them survive when they are their weakest

* AP carries all about long range (ex AP Kog, Xerath, to a lesser extent Lux) ideally should not be in range to ignite their targets. Should someone manage to get into their face, cleanse would most likely prove useful.

In general, by taking cleanse over ignite you trade some level of kill power for added survivability. I believe that in some matchups the gained survivability outweighs the lost kill power (ignite gives you both damage and the healing debuff, either aspect can be itemized for with either a dfg or morellomnicon, but cleanse's itemization QSS doesn't build into anything lategame on midlaners).

VS Ryze: http://i.imgur.com/lqyICar.jpg

* Counterplay to cleanse mid, given you cannot see enemy summoner spells from lobby.

* Good champions to take cleanse mid on

Some people have a champion that just ""clicks"" with them, meaning that they understand intuitively how the champion works and can do ridiculous things with said champion that no one else does. The first champion that clicked for me was Eve (back when smite-revive was op) and since then I've had Shyvana, Elise, and Kha'zix.

So far I am 9-1 after following spellsy's guide on lolking with a few minor adjustments based on my preferences. He describes fiddle as having a power curve in the lane which I very much noticed: 1-2 his silence is op dmg if u get it to chain off the ad+supp but 3-5 he is pretty weak in the lane just because you don't have many ranks in fear or your ult yet. But once he hits 6 his kill potential is unreal, I cant think of any support with stronger kill potential at 6/7. Once you have the fabled op 3sec fear his zoning becomes very powerful provided your adc is following up. His response to gank attempts is also excellent with his fear/silence. Even if you slip up and get behind you still have your lvl 6 all in. In one of my games we fed a draven taric lane and the draven was up a bf sword on my carry by the time I hit lvl 6 but even so I was still able to ult in and secure my carry a double kill (keep in mind I would not have done this if draven had cleanse available). If I find myself getting fed (those times when you ""accidentally"" ks) I'l go for zhonyas and play him as I would jungle fid as a mini ap carry in order for my team to not be put back by me having so much gold, but usually I do a pretty standard support build.

I often hear hes a really niche pick but so far ive found only one matchup to be troublesome. That matchup being a decent caitlin just because its so difficult to get into fear range your only hope is to time when shes going in for a cs. But besides that aslong as you use your pink to control your brush in the troublesome 3-5 lvl zone all of the matchups have worked out quite nicely so far. You have to be very careful against taric/leonas because one slip and you very often are dead but the match up is manageable with proper brush control.

Later on in the teamfight phase I generally max my cdr and just peel with fear for my carry or go for one of their carrys if  I think I can do it safely. Also with proper ward coverage and twin shadows you can make so many plays for your team with your fear. What thoughts does reddit have on the support fiddlesticks?

For reference here is Spellsy's guide: http://www.lolking.net/guides/48492

Starting Doran's Blade/Boots, rush into Tear and Vamp Scepter your first back, with a Ruby Crystal or another Doran's if you need the durability/have the money.
Your midgame items are Sheen, Brutalizer, BF Sword.
These will build into Iceborn, Black Cleaver, and BT.
Endgame defensive items are standard but Scimitar is best if possible.

Overall, 
Berserker's Greaves | Muramana | Iceborn Gauntlet | The Black Cleaver | The Bloodthirster | Mercurial Scimitar/Guardian's Angel


This build adds to your damage directly and adds variation to it through Muramana and the sheer flat AD the items provide, making your true damage very high. Iceborn essentially has 10 AD tacked onto it from building Manamune, and Gatling Gun fully procs BC on it's own, providing flat armor shred at the same time. It is also very durable for an ADC, nearing off-tankish while still being high dmg.

I don't see a better way to build Corki at the moment, given the constant damage this build puts out in teamfights and the tankiness Iceborn gives you.

EDIT://
To those questioning Iceborn, Trinity is no longer the end-all be-all of autoattack/casting champs. I chose it over trinity for it's cost, AOE, added durability, CDR, and AP/AD(mana) for your abilities, in that order. It has higher overall utility than Trinity, something Corki can use to greater effect than more damage.

*I am not saying in any way that I found or created this build, I actually saw it on [this reddit comment by burt_flaxton](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/14qdd7/static_shiv/c7fh7qf).* I'm no pro, but it seems to work really well for me. It's a Gangplank build that focuses on getting as much gold as possible through farming and abusing the Q on-hit effect/passive.

Basically you can start boots like normal, unless you're jungling, and should use machete. You can also start brawler gloves if you want an earlier start on the GP10. 

Try to get an avarice blade as soon as possible, because its passive gives you 2 gold per minion kill. You can also buy a philo stone, because it obviously racks up more gold, but I usually don't.

Your boots are up to you depending on who you're against. I usually go merc treads, since I mostly go jungle. 

Next, you can either start your Tiamat or just get the Vampiric Sceptre for more sustain. But finish the Ravenous Hydra ASAP after that. Alternatively, you can buy the Iceborn Gauntlet especially for the mana and armor.

The splash damage works with your Parley and Avarice Blade passives to give you 10 extra gold per minion. And if you want, you can even have a Twisted Fate on your team since his passive gives you another 2 gold per kill.

The rest of the build is really up to you. But you should keep your Avarice Blade as long as possible.

Just want some feedback from some other Elise players. As a side note I think of Elise as a mid lane or top lane champ only. I hate her in the jungle. idk about the new jungle now tho.

* Liandry's Torment: I see this as being absolutely core on her, no matter what lane. More % hp damage is fine by me, combined with a rylais, a single human form Q will do ~230 + 23% of a persons HP (ignoring all other sources of ap.)
* Iceborn Gauntlet : I think One of the main problems with Elise top lane is that she has no sticking power after she gap closes with spider E.  This not only gives her a more offensive oriented armor option other than frozen heart (now that randuins doesn't build from heart of gold) but it gives her the ability to stick to people after she jumps on them. Might not be worth getting over rylais, but it provides a ton of stats that she wants.

* Banner of Command: possibly an early armor option that will also give her increased ap and pushing power. I read on this subreddit that The passive applies to her spiderlings. This will help out her split pushing and possibly maker her melt single targets late game, but I dont know if it will be worth picking up over Gauntlet or FH.

* DFG: on mid lane I think this will make her absolutely overpowered. use it as a replacement for Rabadons. A DFG-Q-W-R-Q combo will absolutely wipe the floor with any squishy on the other team. With the CDR returning, this combined with Iceborn will give a hefty amount of cdr and still do ridiculous burst damage.

* Twin shadows: A cheap Ap and MR item. Building from a GP10 is a huge plus, as is the added movement speed. I see it as an option for a more spider oriented top lane build, since she can stick to targets using the active. Possibly an alternative to gauntlet in that respect.

* Spirit of the spectral wraith: I know I said I hate jungle Elise, but anything goes in the new jungle for now. Obviously its bad in a lane, but in the jungle she will have ridiculous sustain with this item. Getting her 'lings to tank for you is easier now from what I understand, so she will probably have a safe clear at lv 1, and this is probably the best option for her late game in the new jungle, unless you are building tank elise (lolwut).

* The black cleaver: Hear me out on this. Back when elise was first released I experimented with AD builds on her, mostly focusing on trinity force and attack speed items like wits end. Pretty much standard irelia builds. With the new black cleaver procs on physical damage, she has the potential to get a nearly instant 4 stacks because her spiderlings deal physical damage. They also scale with her armor pen, which this item gives a bit of, and it gives cooldown reduction and HP, which are both amazing stats on her. This could possibly make AD Elise more viable. ( I think that it is already, but mostly in the jungle, as AP elise does the same thing, but better.)

* malady: Though it has pretty much the same synergy with her kit as before, the fact that its damage now scales with ap, and the new spellsword mastery makes this an interesting option for a more DPS oriented build, probably best suited for top lane. With a maximum magic penetration runeset (22MPen) and sorc shoes, guise, and malady, she has the potential to ignore ~85 Mr and deal pretty good DPS with her attack speed roid. 

That is about all I have come up with. Let me know what you think in the comments, tell me if I missed anything interesting, and cheers to season 3!

I've noticed from a few games that most teams tend to go ADC, APC, Tank, but who goes where has been all over the place. I haven't really seen any supports with the removal of wards, and most people tend to share CS, but I expect that to change eventually.

I'm noticing certain champions are a *lot* more viable on TT than SR, melee AD carries being the most prominent. While Yi or Fiora would never see competitive play on SR anymore, the lack of wards combined with their high mobility make them deadly foes. Certain items have made other characters much more viable as well (coughcough Singed+torch coughcough)

The early game seems to focus around the altars more so than farming, making heavy AoE nukers and stunners like Annie and Amumu a great choice for altar seiges. Denying that +4 gold per kill early on can mean a huge advantage by the time they can get their altars back, and an almost assured victory, not to mention the huge damage boost it gives.

Just for clarification, i'm around 1750 elo. So if you run this at 2200 and get killed, don't blame me. 

So what is the cash money support? You basically feel like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0TIoL3yhw&amp;t=01m45s).

Alright. I'll stop joking around. 

The basic idea is to take the extra GP/10 masteries along with the extra 40g. You go gp/10 seals and quints. This gives you 7.3 gold per 10 right out of the gate. Then, you take a regrowth pendant as your first item. This leaves you with 80g, which you use to buy one ward. Use this ward around the two minute mark in the river/tribush. Right as this ward times out, you have enough money to go back and get a philo plus another ward. This equates to roughly a 4 minute philo. If you can convince your AD to let you take an extra CS or two, i've gotten mine as early as 3 minutes. 

a 3 minute GP/10 with a base of +7.3 GP/10. You'd be amazed at how much better you feel. You will never feel broke. The regrowth pendant makes not having armor from yellows for trades a null point. 14 hp/10 is stupid in lane. 

The reason i post this is that i think a lot of people go the faerie charm without realizing why they do. 4 wards is nice, yes, but what's the point if you just sit on your ass all day in lane? Maybe you can baby sit your AD better. But i've almost never seen anyone do what i do. 

A bonus to this strategy is what i like to call ""infinite oracles"". Essentially, with this build and 2 GP/10's, you have enough income that at the end of the game, if your team needs, you can constantly be buying oracles. Even if you die. I've had games where we were behind by 4 towers and 15 kills, i'll buy an oracles for map controll. Die after getting a somewhat good engage for our team (pick one off early, trade even 3 for 3 in the end). Buy another oracles. Take map control. Get a slightly better engage for the team. Sure, it won't work every game, but the ability to lose that oracles, get it back, and create good teamfights for your team is pretty good. 

A lot of people just go faerie charm without understanding that the BIG benifit to it is that you can place early wards on the map (wraits, red, blue, ect). If you just take 4 wards and sit on your ass in lane, the regrowth pendant + 1 ward is incredibly powerful.

http://lol.askmrrobot.com/tools/builder/draven-vs-targetdummy/6a2ddc0d-5c68-4534-a2c0-dbd7d85ff259

After reading the recent Reign of Gaming post about Breaking the Meta with AD carry builds, I decided to try some builds on my favorite champ, Draven. I have recently tested the one in the title with great success. I even had a game where I rushed The Brutalizer after 2 Doran's Blades.

Interestingly enough, replacing Berzerker's Greaves with Boots of Lucidity didn't lower damage that significantly. I think this is good for champs who have long cooldowns you would like to use more often, if coupled with The Brutalizer.

* Ezreal's E
* Grave's W, E
* Corki's Valkyrie
* Etc

Normally whatever you level last has a high cooldown. The CDR from this shaves of 5-6 seconds of each of these spells. It's a niche choice I like, but normally isn't the best. I think it would benefit those new to AD carrying the most, because they can use their escape spells more often, and being new they might be able to effectively use the AS bonus Berzerker's Greaves.

Anyways, you can see 3 of the games I tried this on (more like 2 since I didn't get past IE on the third; I was running ArPen though).

Thoughts? Tell me how bad this idea is. I am having trouble seeing it.

**EDIT 1**: Added clarification to CDR. Also added the IE&gt;PD&gt;BT build to the graphs.

Coming from someone who pretty much exclusively jungles, she is super fun.

I went 22/4/14 my first game, which is probably a result of people not knowing how to play against her/not expecting her ganks. I wouldn't say she feels overpowered (maybe not even a tier 1 jungle because of slight mana problemsShe feels very similar to Akali in the aspect that she snowballs very hard. 

I played her a semi-tanky AP build - Cloth/5 into Merc treads, Rylai's, Void Staff, Deathcap, Zhonya's, Banshee's Veil. Went 9/21/0 and took Atk Spd reds, Armor yellows, AP/lvl blues, Ap quints. Probably not the most well optimized build but I was just trying some stuff out. If you dont go mpen reds, you're going to have to get an earlier void staff, but atk speed seems to work too because it synergizes with her passive atk speed boost.

You could probably start Boots/3 on her considering how high her hp stays while jungling, but you wont have much power if you go for lvl 2 ganks. I feel like Hextech could work on her well, but honestly she has no problems whatsoever with sustain in the jungle without lifesteal or spellvamp. Simply taking 2 points in w early game before making Q will make you take almost no damage from creep camps because of the double shield. lvl 1 of the ability is almost as much shield as a health pot.

She jungles fairly fast, and can feasibly start blue or red, the clear time was somewhere around 3:30 I think. Not much dueling or counterjungling potential unfortunately (though I didn't have an opportunity to try) - she has no escapes unless you can jump to a creep with your ult (I'm pretty sure it works on minions, might want to verify this). Her level 4 gank is okay, with a small displacement ability and a 35% slow for 2 sec. Her lvl 6 is very good, with an effective 9 sec cd on her ult (only using q) - you can possibly use it 3 times if you have a gank lasting longer than 9 seconds. It is very difficult to get away from her, even if you can get a stun or slow off.

Her scaling is quite good late game - Passive at 0.6 every 3 hits, Q at 0.8, W at 0.6, and R at 0.6. All of her abilities except R are AoE and will just annihilate squishies. She mostly works as an assasin who jumps to the back line to kill carries, but with a bit of tankiness can also initiate or at least disrupt with R-E. Her E is super strong in teamfights - it works like an Orianna R + W with a 55% slow and no dmg.

With a bit of cdr your Q cd is ~5 seconds so you can use her ult around 4 times in a mediumish-length teamfight (counting one non-moonlight use at the end). Unless you can kill the Diana coming at your carries, they're gonna die - you just cant run away.

So, just a some initial ideas on the champ, I wish I'd been able to play her more but its a scramble to actually pick her without someone else getting to it first.

Does anyone have any good resources they can link me where I can learn how to do this properly. I get the basics, you walk in between shots, but I'm not sure how to always use it effectively, especially when I get a lot of attack speed and moving in between shots slows my attacks down by a lot. 

Any help is appreciated, thanks.

Edit - 

So here's the answers I gathered for anyone that doesn't want to dig through the comments.

""Basically there are 3 types of frames for all auto attacks. Wind up, attacking, and wind down. What you do to orb walk is give a movement command during the wind down section of an attack animation. That will cancel the wind down animation and cause your champion to movie instead. Essentially, that's animation canceling."" 

Apperently the correct term is stutterstep, not orbwalking, which is supposed to be a term from Dota where you harrass without taking minion aggro.

""Studderstep: Move &gt; Attack &gt; Move once projectile has left champion &gt; Repeat""

It makes me angry when someone does this and I feel it's detrimental to the team.

Here are my reasons:

* **750 team gold**  Early gold is much better than late gold and I rather that our team have it now, upfront, as opposed to 5-10 minutes later

* **Free Roaming** Now that my lane is won I'm looking to pressure other lanes and take down their tower.  I can use this extra time to 2v1 in another lane.  Also, it gives a lot of opportunity to easily take down another tower.

* **Bulk Farming** Now that I took down the enemy tower, I just need to keep an eye on my old lane and get back to re-push it whenever minions are knocking at the doorstep.  Usually this farming is done via AOE so I can get back to exploiting roaming mismatches.  The gold/time ratio is extremely favorable when I do this.

* **Opponents lose zone of control** If a turret goes down, your team now has a much easier time of pressuring the buffs.  It opens up another ingress or egress point and can open up those game-breaking jungle ambushes that result from players ambushed when facechecking their own jungle.

* **Wards** Now you can get wards deeper into the enemy territory with less risk.  

* **Closer to Winning** It's necessary to kill towers to win.  It just brings you that much closer to hitting an inhibitor.

The only argument I see against doing this behavior is that it ruins the 'farm' of a lane.  The enemy can now farm at his second turret and freeze the lane.  However if your opponent is doing this, he's saddling his team with a **huge opportunity cost**. The opposing team knows where this player always is, and is unlikely to be available to contribute  in teamfights away from the frozen lane.  Doing this is much more a liability than an asset.

**tl;dr - Kill a tower whenever you can.**",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_vouxw,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/vouxw/why_i_kill_towers_asap/,
1340675513.0,18,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,vlts4,Fizz - Rushing Lich Bane vs rushing Deathcap - a small analysis,gandodepth,19,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/vlts4/fizz_rushing_lich_bane_vs_rushing_deathcap_a/,"Well, let's do some math.

If you've got the standard AP quintessences on, that's 15 AP. With triple Doran's rings, that's an additional 45 AP. With the 4 AP mastery and the 1 AP/lvl mastery, by the time you're level 11 (I think that's a reasonable time to have a Lich Bane), you'd have 75 AP before that Lich Bane. Lich Bane gives you 80 AP, so that's a total of 155 AP.

A standard harass combo is WQ and then E-E away.

According to [this League of Legends Wiki article](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Fizz_the_Tidal_Trickster), total AP ratio of the WQ combo is 1.3.

The passive ability of Lich Bane is as follows: 

&gt;Unique: On cast, your next autoattack will deal additional physical damage equal to 100% of your ability power. 2 second cooldown.

This is basically an addition of 1.0 to the total AP ratio of this combo, so WQ will end up with a total AP ratio of 2.3, which is **322 total additional damage** before mitigation.

With the same item build (triple Doran's and the same masteries/runes) and a Deathcap, you will have 279.5 AP. Using the same WQ combo, this will result in **363 total additional damage** before mititagion.

There are upsides and downsides to both builds.

**Upsides to Lich Bane rush**

* Additional damage is physical, which very few mid players itemize against

* If you properly utilize your skills in such a way that you use the Lich Bane proc on all four of your skills, you will basically gain a 4.0 AP ratio from it.

* Smaller component items

* Magic Resistance and Movement Speed bonuses from Lich Bane (the Movement Speed bonus is probably a very large reason why many people rush it, as Fizz is a very ganking-oriented champion.)

**Advantages of a Rabadon's Deathcap rush**

* More damage if you're going for a quick R-W-EE on top of the enemy - autoattack-Q-autoattack burst attack and don't have the time to wait for Lich Bane cooldown

In conclusion, yeah, there's ups and downs to both builds, but the additional movement speed and MR from Lich Bane will almost always allow you to win trades if you're able to get it early enough to still be in lane, and the movement speed will allow you to gank other lanes faster and outrun chasing enemies if your Playful / Trickster isn't quite enough.

I'm currently experimenting with my teammates about some unorthodox champion/role combinations (trying to tune up jungle Irelia ATM) and after finding Nautilus support to work amazing for my team, I'm thinking about Orianna.

She has strong AA-enhancer giving her decent harass without mana usage.
She has buckets of utility as her ball gives vision, haste/slow, shield equal to Janna's (and giving resistances instead of AD) and dat Ultimate.
She has decent basic damage but pretty average scalings (from 0.3 to 0.7).

I just think she fits. She can do decent in lane and has really good transition as her skillset is just all about her utility for team.

After Philo Stone, HoG and Kage's Lucky Pick - what Orianna should buy?
Just get Shurelya or Aegis?

We could even try to get Morello for CDR/Mana Regen and AP.

It just says it is on 'on hit effect.' So is this Physical, Magic or True damage? So what exactly is this 'Bonus' damage? 

If it is True Damage is surpasses Brute Force easily. If it is Physical then anyone with ArPen will still benefit from Butcher over Brute Force. If you are building MPen and it does Magic Damage, Butcher is better than Brute Force.

The only instance I can think of when you would take Brute Force over  Butcher is if Butcher does Magic Damage and you are going to be building ArPen.

A friend who is new to the game recently asked me for advice on boots. He's convinced that Boots of Swiftness (Enhanced Movement +3) are necessary for his carries because they let him chase, escape, and move around the map faster. 

I tried to tell him that Boots 1 give +50 MS, Boots 2 give +70 MS, and Boots 3 give +90 MS (diminished returns), but he thinks that 20 MS difference is very important.

I tried to tell him that you can combine Boots 2 with three MS quints for basically the same movement speed as Boots 3 (only 3 MS less actually) and still come out ahead stat-wise, but he thinks the 20 MS advantage is more important than 25% attack speed (Zerks), 25% armor and 10% attack damage reduction (Tabi), or 25% armor and 35% tenacity (Mercs). He also reasons that Boots 3 + three MS quints make you even faster and will probably go that route (+108 vs. +87 MS)!

I tried to tell him that if he improves his map awareness, team fight awareness, and positioning he won't need that extra MS as a crutch, but he says the crutch makes him stronger, so why not use it?

I then said that all that MS is useless if you get jumped on by champions with gap-closers, stuns, and slows. I even tried to use the metaphor that 20 additional MS will win a marathon but it won't win by much in a short sprint. He conceded these points, but still seems pretty adamant about Boots of Swiftness.

I don't know... maybe I'm the crazy one? I just don't see the point of Boots of Swiftness on very many champions (Ashe and Garen being the most likely candidates).

His three mains are Shyvana, Ezreal, and Teemo. Can the LoLmeta community help to convince him otherwise?

* Top Lane - Bruiser Yorick
* Jungle - Bruiser Tryndamere
* Mid - AP Zilean

This team has strong synergy. I think if the team puts their ultimates towards Tryndamere and Vayne, then they can effectively teamfight with ease. Yorick+Zilean reviving Vayne, and Tryndamere invuln again by Kayle.

Furthermore, true damage counters any armor stacking at late game. Vayne build should have the core bloodthirster, infinity edge, phantom dancer, and guardian angel.

I also believe this exact combination is strong because it's highly flexible. You could swap Yorick for Tryndamere top. Swap Zilean for Kayle mid, and etc. Very flexible lane changing.

In League of Legends there are always going to be perceived problems with balance - it is the name of the game, nerf one champion and another becomes perceived to be over powered. It is an endless cycle. Due to the astronomical number of variables in deciding balance, whatever changes you make you are never going to reach the stage where you can say that the game is perfectly balanced.

This is all well and good but it begs the question, what is the point in slightly nerfing and slightly buffing champions? It is all about perception. Recently Orianna got taken down just a fraction - the range on her Q ability and the mana cost got increased slightly. I have no evidence to support this but through observation I feel like I have been seeing less of her recently. These changes didn't affect the great burst and CC which she can perform. Only slightly her early game lane presence. The nerf made people perceive her to be worse even if the numbers tell a different story and this led to her being taken down from the top tier.

This reason is why every patch notes you see many small tweaks for champions who people have been crying out for changes. The changes change very little - the champions are still just as viable. The reason they change perception so well is that little small changes are very hard for people to evaluate, what does a 10% reduction of the tenacity on singed's ultimate mean? All it means is that a champion you thought deserved a nerf recieved one.

1. His passive is very strong while laning - an 8% exp boost means that everyone gets to level 6 faster and means a much more likely first blood. At a top level this is a great advantage as it is crucial to get an early advantage. 

2. At a lower ELO his ultimate is incredibly difficult to use correctly but high level supports know when to use it. A revive can really change a game, it allows your team to be more aggressive and assertive during team fights. If used correctly it gives you a 6th member to your team.

3. His harass is also very good at lower levels, his double bomb deals great consistent damage during the laning phase.

As far as I see it the problem with Zilean is that he has such a high skill cap that if he is nerfed then he will become useless at lower tiers.

So what I propose is countering these specific champs by swapping your AP carry and your AD carry. Caitlyn in particular can decimate Kassadin mid lane though I don't know if she can do the same to LB/Akali. For the APs part they will level slower but since they usually do better burst damage than the ranged AD that should provide for interesting opportunities in the bottom lane (assuming your support is a taric/alistar/janna not a Soraka).

* TheOddOne finds him intriguing enough that he plans on investigating Cho's viability in jungle
* Cho is a beastly laner.

Ergo, let's discuss the best way to maximize his potential in jungle. Typically when I play Cho I play a mix of AP/Armor/MR as he gets naturally high HP with feast and a little AP  (Radabons) makes him hit hard. 

Problems:

* Stonewall's jungle typically involves leveling e first and I find this to be effective in jungle. However it's not making good use of any AP that you would buy (spikes do have a .3 AP ration but I don't find it worthwhile to rush radabons with just that and level 1 scream/rupture).

* Ganks are troublesome unless your lane has decent CC as you need to land rupture. My best solution so far is to run in with red to apply the slow, then rupture. Alternatively if your lane stuns, you can drop rupture/scream immediately. This means no level 2 ganks however.
* Items like razor/lantern don't make a ton of sense on him.

Strengths

* Can counter jungle well due to high HP and ability to take camps fast.
* Can take just about any route through the jungle and be ok
* Can build AP or AS/onhit and be useful to the team
* Great utility with Silence + knock up.


Considering that his rupture and scream are useful just as utililities you can probably build him as an AS/Atmas and be ok
I'm considering:

* Cloth Armor + 5 code red
* Wit's End, Malady if you really don't need the MR.
* Atmas Impaler
* Mallet or Chain or Negatron, expand as needed
boots in there somewhere and potentially you could rush a lantern as the razor procs are great and the free wards are amazing.

Alternatively if your team needs some AP

* cloth + 5
* boots
* Needlessly Large Rod
* Chain and / or Negatron as needed
* NLR &gt; Radabons.
this is cheaper and more adaptable but I don't know if it will seriously slow down the jungling until you can afford NLR.


Some parting questions:

* How is my theory crafting? I know people that play the on-hit / AS builds with him but none of them are over 1300 elo
* What are your favorite cho routes in jungle? I like to steal wraiths and then run all my minor camps before buying boots, going to blue and doing a full clear. 
* Any tips on ganking? I really like to play junglers who have the option of a level 2 gank.
* Is there anyway to have a good jungle while starting regrowth pendant in order to build p. stone for the G/10?
* What runes do you use, I've just been using the standard 25 ArPen, 13 Armor, scaling MR/lvl blues.
* other thoughts?

1312824399.0,18,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,jckxf,"Magic pen, is it worth it?",FestiveFruitcake,20,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/jckxf/magic_pen_is_it_worth_it/,"I have been playing for over a year now, and after experimenting with a lot of different runes and builds, I feel like there are better choices than magic pen for a lot of AP champions.

My reasoning behind this is that in a reasonably high skill level game, the enemy team *will* buy magic resist to counter your damage, especially if you are doing well. This makes void staff a core part of any build on characters that do a large amount of magic damage.

What does this have to do with flat magic pen runes? Well as the 40% penetration from void staff is applied after magic pen and any magic resist reduction, it is inefficient to get both percentage penetration and flat penetration/reduction. For example if the target has 30 base magic resist, mercury treads, banshees and MR/lvl scaling blues, they will have 129 magic resist at level 18 (30+25+50+24 = 129).

This means that if you have 9 magic penetration from runes, 20 magic penetration from sorcerers shoes as well as the 15% penetration from the offense tree along with a void staff you should have 29 flat magic penetration and 49% percentage penetration.

So looking at our target with 129 magic resist, the flat penetration reduces it to 100, (wow that's convenient, i didn't plan that lol) then the 49% reduces it to 51 magic resist. Pretty good right?

Well if we look at this without the magic pen boots and runes, using just the void staff and the mastery point. 129 gets reduced to 65.8. So where did that 29 flat penetration go? This is because as the percentage penetration is applied last, it effectively reduces your flat penetration by the same percentage of your percentage penetration.

For example with the 29 flat penetration we reduced the enemy magic resist to 51, without the flat pen it was reduced to 65.8. 

65.8 - 51 = 14.8  -  This shows how much flat penetration you actually get from the runes and boots in the end.

29 - 14.8 = 14.2  -  This is how much magic penetration is **wasted** by the percentage penetration.

29*0.51 = 14.8  -  This shows how flat magic pen is reduced by percentage penetration.

So what would i take instead? I have recently been using armour penetration marks instead of magic penetration. This makes last hitting creeps become easier as their armour increases throughout the game, as well as making my auto attacks much stronger for early game harass. This also allows me to take mercury treads instead of sorcerers shoes, giving me that valuable 35% CC reduction, as well as a nice bit of early game magic resist to counter any enemy magic penetration.

In my opinion, flat magic penetration isn't worth it in the end. Early game it may increase your damage output slightly, but in the end a lot of it wasted. By using some defensive, utility or other offensive runes such as armour pen for marks, gives very little to no early game disadvantage, but a considerable mid/late game advantage.

There are several tier lists floating around trying to rate champions and their viability in soloqueue. Just yesterday another one was published on cloth5.com (http://cloth5.com/foxdrops-solo-queue-jungle-tier-list-patch-3-10/). I like the list and the rundown of champions but I have to question the actual order of champions.  

A good example in this list would be Amumu. He is listed in tier 2 and while this isn't bad it is not tier1. Yet Amumu has one of the highest solo queue winrates (53%) in all elos including diamond. Usually people argue that Amumu isn't perfect due to his susceptibility to early invades and so does the author of this tier list. But Amumu obviously must have other advantages or else he wouldn't have this amazing winrate.

On the other hand we have champions like Elise (46%) and Nocturne (47%) both listed in tier1. The author describes how Nocturne clears so amazingly fast, has nice steroids and has amazing lvl6 ganks. Sounds good and I agree with him but obviously he can't be perfect or else his winrate would be higher.

1370641799.0,14,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1fw2gs,I want some opinions on my unconventional strategy behind playing Syndra. It centers around building gp/10s...,siero20,20,6,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1fw2gs/i_want_some_opinions_on_my_unconventional/,"I have the most games played as syndra in NA. I love my build, and it has worked the majority of the time from Silver up to Platinum 1. I have a 58% win rate with her over 575 games with her, mostly mid lane, probably about 75 games top and 25 as support (I quit doing that when I got out of silver).

Here's the gist of it:
* Masteries: 21/0/9, nothing crazy.
* Runes: Gp/10 + 5.25, MagPen + 7.83, AP + 10.7

* Items: Philosopher's stone -&gt; kage's lucky pick -&gt; chalice of harmony -&gt; boots (If I don't have gold to complete chalice or kages, I buy this earlier) -&gt; Sorcerers Shoes or Athenes -&gt; Homeguard -&gt; Liandrys -&gt; Rylais (Health is always built first) -&gt; Sell Philo for Void -&gt; Sell kages for rabadons.

* Level Order: Q -&gt; E -&gt; Q -&gt; W. Maxing Q first and then E.
* Summoners: Flash Ignite.

Here are my reasons for trying this build out, and then continuing to use it:

* I realized early on when experimenting with syndra, that I could burst most other mid laners down without building any damage. This resulting in my trying out gold/10.
* I realized that syndra's E works as a great disengage for losing fights. Especially if you know how to position yourself to get more than one enemy lined up for a stun. I started maxing E second for the lower CD on an important stun.
* By relying on her E, I typically spend laning phase attempting to prevent kills from happening. I try to ward both sides of mid and follow my lane, disengaging or winning the fight if one results in another lane.
* I found that building syndra conventionally (rushing rabadons/dfg/zonyas/void staff) caused her to fall off fairly hard even if she was bullying in lane. Typically she could nuke the adc or apc, but due to her lower ult range she'd normally get caught up and die. Or worse, she'd be unable to penetrate the frontline and have to ult one of the enemy tanks. Typically this didn't result in much being done.
* The +800 health from rylais+liandrys helps her survive if initiated upon. Once it's lategame and we're teamfighting, I like to play syndra in the front, either poking with the long range of her stun, or attempting to catch a squishier champ with the stun. In most cases the health is enough of a defense to not get burst down in an engage.

Here's some issues that I'm aware of, feel free to discuss them as well:
* I can't pressure well. It's fairly obvious and to be expected, even if I'm winning lane, I likely wont' get an early tower push, or be able to take/stop dragon very well.
* Syndra does not have good mobility, my delay of buying boots does not help either. When against a high mobility champ this can be very difficult for my team.
* This causes a lot of tension with teammates that are traditional. Nobody wants to see their 2/0 mid buy philo and kages instead of something snowbally. And I don't have near enough time to try and defend my build in game, other than saying ""It's always worked for me in the past"".

Let me know what you guys think about this here. I'm definitely planning on changing up my strategy when I hit diamond, or maybe before. Up to this point I can reliably win lane without quints/yellows that actually help me, and while building the gold/10's.

If you'd really like to help me out, I want to slowly phase out starting with gp/10's and change my runes to something a bit more beneficial.

At first, it was more of a joke build then anything, but then it started to work, and worked well. So here's my build, with masteries, runes, and items.

[Build](http://leaguecraft.com/builder/sivir/?items=431,117,321,271,33,29&amp;runes=36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,385,385,385&amp;level=18&amp;masteries=01424003100200030110403000010000000000000000000000000000&amp;skiller=qwqeqrqwqwrwweeree&amp;fspells=true)

[LoLKing](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/23731480#history)

Granted, it's not a diamond (or even gold), but all my 3 games are there.

**The goods:**

1. This is a push lane, no doubt about it. With a lv3 Q and W, you can probably clear the entire wave and pressure their bottom lane at their tower, with free autos, Q, and W. You don't have to worry about missing farm and keeps constant pressure on their bot lane. 

2. This also brings up jungle presence. You need to be aware of it at all times, but with the Sivir spell shield, you have a relatively good chance to escape from most ganks. However, this also prevents their jungler from ganking other lanes, freeing up your other lanes from pressure as well as giving your jungler more breathing room for ganks.

3. Cooldown is absolutely fabulous on Sivir. You're going to be at 39% after you finish the 3 core items (Boots, Spirit, Lizard), effectively giving you a 5.49 (Q), 1.83 (W), 6.1 (E), 48.8 (R). What I want to press here is the CDR on the Q and W, you honestly don't need any extra attack speed if you can land the Q, and the burst is much higher with that then any autoattacks (negating crits). The 6.1 seconds on spell shield is amazing as well for defensive purposes. 

4. You can't run away from Sivir, she has higher chase potential than Vayne and the gauntlet guarantees no escaping.

**The bads:**

1. So the problem with this is, you most likely will need a Soraka on the team. I haven't tried it with any other supports, but Soraka negates the problem of having any lifesteal in your build and cures the mana problem early game (very important part for being a pushing lane). This also means you need a duo to have effective communication. No communication means that the Soraka might not be as effective as you would like her to be, limiting on how this strategy might work during the laning phase.

2. Also, like Ezreal, you need to hit the Q to be somewhat successful in trades. Her W is also really buggy with the lizard elder item. Sometimes I would see it proc, and other times, nothing. I'm also unsure if Q and W proc the Muramana, but I do not believe it to be so.

3. Builds are also situational, In the end I believe Barrier &gt; Ignite because she already has a lot of damage built into her kit. I settled on the banshee's as a last item because ultimately, she needed more health and the extra spell block was nice as well.

4. No kill potential, not with a Soraka support anyways. However, you don't really need to have the kill potential because of the massive farm you get from this build. As much as I hate to say it, if you can't complete most of the build based on farm, then you're not playing effectively with this composition.

#

In conclusion, while this build isn't the greatest thing on Sivir, it is highly fun to play, and not to mention throws the enemy team off. You need to have synergy with your support to pull this off well, but the laning phase is absolutely gorgeous if you can pull it off correctly, and while this is different from a kill lane Sivir, you give opportunities for your other lanes to carry via Jungle pressure or from your ultimate. Let me know what you guys think of this, and do **try it out for yourself before ultimately thinking this is a stupid build.**",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_1elsgh,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1elsgh/blue_sivir/,

Greetings all! I’m back with another build strategy. Previously I talked about AP-Hurricane Kog [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/18x9bi/discussion_and_testing_ap_hurricane_kogmaw/)

This time, let us look at [Yorick](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Yorick) the Gravedigger. Yorick does great bullying in lane, and his Ultimate is game changing. 

I got to try this build on Yorick once, and it appeared to be going well for me. Sorry, I don’t remember how it turn out of if we won or lost, but I was doing decent.

This build focuses on Mana, Tankiness, and being a Pain in the ***. 

Full Build: 

[Muramana]( http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Muramana) + 
[Ninja Tabi](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ninja_Tabi) / [Mercury Treads](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Mercury%27s_Treads) + 
[Iceborn Gauntlet](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Iceborn_Gauntlet) + 
[Frozen Heart] (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen_Heart) + 
[Banshee’s Veil](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Banshee%27s_Veil) +
[Last Whisper](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Whisper)

Stats from Items: 

* Health: 400 (Banshee’s Veil) = **400**
* Mana: 1000 (Muramana) + 500 (Iceborn Gauntlet) + 400  (Frozen Heart) + 300 (Banshee’s Veil)  = **2200 Mana**
* Armor: 70 (Iceborn Gauntlet) + 95 (Frozen Heart) = **165 Armor** + 25 (Ninja Tabi)
* Magic Resist: 45 (Banshee’s Veil) = **45** + 25(Mercury Treads)
* Damage: 20( Base Muramana) + 44( Muramana Passive) + 40 (Last Whisper) = **104** + ~181.8 (Muramana Toggle from Total Max Stats Mana)
* CDR: 10% (Iceborn Gauntlet) + 20%(Frozen Heart) = **30%**

Total Max Stats (Calculated without Runes/Masteries): 
* Health:  421 (Base) + 1445 (85 per Level) + 400 (Items) = **2266**

* Mana: 235 (Base) + 595 (35 Per Level) + 2200 (Items) = **3030**

* Armor: 18 (Base) + 61.2 (3.5 per level) + 165 (Items) = **244.2**

* Magic Resist: 30 (Base) + 21.25 (1.25 per level) + 45 (Items) = **96**

* Damage = 51.5 (Base) + 59.5 (3.5 per level) + 60 (Items) + 60 (Muramana Passive of Total Mana) = **231**

**The Ghouls**

Ever important aspect of Yorick, their stats would fall to be:

* Health : 793.1
* Damage: 80.85

**Other Key Notes**

While some stats seem low, like Magic Resist, as it appears in the current meta, someone is going to have a Runic Bulwark, and you probably have flat Magic Resist Runes, so you will be over 100 MR.

You have all the abilities that come with those items. With Frozen Heart and Iceborn, paired with your Omen of Pestilence (W), you have amazing sticking power to go after a carry and shut them down.

The CDR from the items, means that you have all three ghouls out and keep your Omen of War (Q) and your Omen of Famine (E) up nearly all the time if they don’t die to AoE, as they last 5 seconds.

**Build Order**

Faerie +Consumables  -&gt; Tear -&gt; Boots -&gt; ??  

Start: Faerie Charm(180) + 1 Ward (75) + 3 Health Pots (105) + 3 Mana Pots (105) + 5 Gold Remaining

Tear obviously needs to come out ASAP to get it stacking to sustain your ghoul powers. 

My lane successfulness was very limited with rushing the Manamune. The stacking of and reaching more mana came faster, my E for sustain was scaling a bit with my damage increase, and better damage trade to opponent with ghoul harass.  

I have not had a chance to try out going Glacial Shroud or Catalyst as first item after Tear.

* Manamune costs 1400 (400 Long Sword + 1000 Combine), 

* Glacial Shroud costs 1350.(400 Sapphire + 720 Chain Vest + 230 Combine).

* Catalyst of the Protector costs 1200 (400 Sapphire + 475 Ruby + 320 Combine) 

**TL;DR**: Yorrick building all mana-items with Muramana core-item as a tanky bruiser.

Discuss:

**Do you think Glacial Shroud should be purchased before Manamune?**

**Which Glacial Shroud Item should be purchased first Iceborn Gauntlet or Frozen Heart?**

**Catalyst coming out sooner like Ryze/Karthus/Singed to get that Regen bonus with each level?**

**Which Ghoul to level first? Omen of Pestilence is great harass and wave clear, but Omen of Famine is the Single-Target Harass and sustain**

If you have have an aggressive lane, like Graves Taric or whatever, your all-in is much stronger. Even if they flash and get away from your all-in, they are going to miss out on creeps and you are still ahead.

My first point of contention is whether to max W or E after Q. Many of the guides I've consulted suggest maxing E second. My logic is that E is mostly used for mobility, and not damage. This is counterintuitive to Renekton's role as a early/mid-game carry. Wouldn't you want the burst nuke and increased damage that W offers instead? Meanwhile, the ArPen that E provides can still make Renekton relevant late-game. What do you guys think?

Second, my runes for Renekton at the moment are ArPen/Armour/MR/Health Regen. Runes are generally a matter of preference but I chose these over normal bruiser pages because I am still learning Renekton. As for masteries, I opted for 21/9/0, grabbing the CDR reduction in the offense tree and the extra HP in the defense tree. This should allow me to maximize bullying in lane with more frequent harass while providing a good amount of HP. Thoughts?

Finally, I am still uncertain about Renekton's combo rotation. This is what I do right now (please tell me if I have been doing it wrong): Once I get my ulti and I want to go all in, I max my rage bar, initiate with E, then press R, follow up with W, E again. At that point my ultimate should have given me enough rage to cast a rage-enhanced Q. With this sequencing, I should be able to maximize damage output as it allows me to cast 3 rage-induced spells while initiating with E for the armour penetration.

He is still one of my favorite champions and these are my thoughts on him.  I am not saying Garen should be played in tournaments as he does have some easy to exploit weaknesses.  I do think he is very fun to play and that more people should play him.

Passive and Stats

* Health regen base and per level reduced.
* Base AD reduced but AD per level increased.
* Perseverance takes longer to activate, but no longer removed from lane minion damage.

Decisive Strike

* Now always a 35% movespeed boost on an 8 second cooldown
* Movespeed duration and silence duration now scales up with rank.
* Removes all slows on Garen.
* Base damage increased at higher ranks.

Courage

* Passively increases armor and mr by 20% rather than 0-25 based on cs
* Damage reduction 30% at all ranks instead of 20-36%
* Now gives 30% CC reduction
* Duration scales with rank, 2-6 seconds instead of 3 at all ranks.
* Cooldown adjusted to 24-20 seconds from 30-18 seconds.

Judgement

* Now scales with Base AD instead of Bonus AD
* AD ratio changes with ranks 0.7-1.1 of total instead of 1.4 of bonus
* Deals 75% damage to minions (up from 50%)
* No longer removes slow on activation or reduce incoming slows
* Garen ignores unit collision, but is slowed when moving through minions

Demacian Justice

* Cooldown adjusted to 160/120/80 from 140/120/100

My thoughts

* Perseverance is great for freezing a lane and seems much more reliable when not hiding in a bush.
* Decisive Strike removing slows seems so much more natural.  Very effective vs champions like Dr. Mundo, Olaf, Kayle.
* Decisive Strike has always been a devastatingly long silence.  Really good vs a lot of mages in teamfights (or ezreal if you can catch him)
* Courage is even more a 1 point wonder and scales really well into late game.  Merc treads, 21 defense, and 30% cc reduction means that no one can stop you (feels like a mini olaf ult).
* Judgement now clears minions really well, allowing you to shove easy and then regen any health you lost with your passive.  Scaling with base ad means that picking up a single armor pen item is all that you need.
* Demacian Justice is so satisfying to use.  It isn't Noxian Guillotine, but it always seems to be up when I want it to be.

I think that glass canon garen is dead but now super tanky garen is in his place.  He scales extremely well with defensive items.  His itemization is much better now and with the addition of maw of malmortius his has some safer offensive options.

I really like picking Garen vs heavy magic damage teams because it is pretty easy for him to get up to 300+ mr.  He still suffers from being a melee without a reliable gap closer and doesn't have any ability to farm from range and is much less of a lane bully from before.  He is not a true tank (no peel) but he can become very disruptive and tanky in team fights.  Even without damage items his damage output is really high and one full combo should level most squishies.

I run 9/21/0 going for ad and armor pen in offense, minion damage reduction and cdr/lvl in defense. My runes are armor pen red, armor yellow, mr/lvl blue, and armor pen quints.

So recently in the competitive scene i've seen a ton of people running team comps that abuse the 2v1 and aim to take the tower early, then swap the lanes and force objectives. 
But this strategy seems kind of counterproductive. By taking an early tower, you force that lane to be pushed, and the enemy solo laner can just freeze the lane at his tier 2 turret. If you swap lanes after this, you put your solo laner at a huge disadvantage. They are forced to farm under their turret, making them very vulnerable to enemy jungle ganks.

Pros:
-Passive CDR with basic attacks, Synergyzes GREAT with his q and w
-Q is basicly a permaslow while chasing if you get some cdr
-W is a gap closer, and an attack speed boost, which causes cdr with your passive
-e is worthless, but can be used to poke lategame
-Your ult can be used to engage, gank, peel, ete., and with your passive, can have a really low CD on it while jungling. 
-Get sheen, win game.

Currently, the league of legends items are heavily stat oriented. You want to build up the items that you have into the larger items as fast as possible because they are the most efficient way to use your gold.

Unfortunately, this leads to lanes snowballing hard. If you get the first kill as, say, an ad carry, you can immediately get a BF sword when your opponent gets something weaker.

How do you counteract this? On the one hand, you want more money to mean more power, but you don't want the lanes to snowball too hard.

Currently, there aren't that many options for how you build your character. When you go back to base, the biggest decision you make, really, is what to build first.

Note that I'm suggesting the tanky Veigar goes mid still. He doesn't really have escapes. Imagine he's Ryze or Swain or Viktor or Cho'Gath or something.

Starting argument for mage Veigar:

With DFG and Rabadon, you'll be maximising the use of all that free AP you get. It also synergises with your kit to a stunning extent. You have high burst and you can make use of that easily, it's clearly the intent of the kit, and it's very strong.

Starting argument for bruiser Veigar:

Your ult scales off your enemy, your wall has no AP ratio, and (most importantly) your Q's cooldown is extremely low, allowing high sustained DPS. Additionally, you get free offensive stats, allowing you to build a couple of items like RoA/Rylai/Abyssal/Zhonya while still feeling pretty highly threatening. Finally, if you decide to go more durable, you can eventually pick up a Lich Bane - and your Q now has a 1.6 ratio on a 2.4s cooldown.

I've spent some time trying to theorycraft Skarner in a way that really abuses his passive, which reduces cooldowns by .5s per basic attack (or 1s if on champion).  To give you a sense of how OP this passive is, consider the fact that you could reduce his 110s CD ulti to 80s, if you can land 30-60 autoattacks on minions/champs. Additionally, I wanted to emphasize very fast initial jungle, so that you can hit 4, at which point jungling is easy because you have rupture (big heals).

Build:

Cloth 5 =&gt; Philo stone =&gt; Boots =&gt; Heart of Gold =&gt; Zerker Greaves =&gt; Stinger =&gt; Sheen =&gt; Phage =&gt; Trinity =&gt; Situationals

Good things about build:

-Build up to Phage only costs 6.1k, so you are almost guaranteed it if you can hit 22minutes and 2-3 kills. 

-Incredible +65% attack speed and 10% CDR means that you will get your ulti very quickly after using it, and your other abilities, like your Q/W/E are mega-spammable, so your attack speed 'scales' your abilities really well.

-Low gold cost + double GP5 income stream. Philostone helps support the insane mana consumption of having such low CDs.

-Stable, high-sustain jungle that does not require Wriggle's.

Edit:

Just tried myself and went 2/0/6. Team took every dragon, and philo meant I could give away every blue after the first.  Ulti helped secure many, many kills.   There is a pretty big gap between sheen and trinity.

I'm a 1300-1500 player. My current rank is 1388 with a high of 1511. I am not good and will rage at team mates (but not spam rage. it'll be like ""wtf, place a ward there dude"" instructional rage? anyways =_=). My katarina in ranked is 54% win rate (not high) 26-22 with 9.1/6.2/6.4 k/d/a. This is just a how-i-play-insertchampion. **If you're already proficient at this champ, move along, nothing new here. But I recommend you looking at my last two bullet as it's a unique ganking method and itemization I thought of.** 

Anyways, a few tips and tricks (and guidelines) on playing kat I've found helpful. 

useful site to reference the skill set: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/index.php?search=katarina&amp;fulltext=Search

* Always get q first. Farming tool. simple.

* Now, consider your enemy. If it's a high sustain (nid) consider maxing e. This is because you don't want to push with q and use it mainly as a last hitting tool. Also you will want to have high burst damage which comes from e. Also harassing is useless as they will heal right back up. Therefore you will want burst to kill them in one go. This method concerns the early game.

* Now if it's a pusher (morg, malz) then maxing q and getting w at lvl 4 will be ideal because you want to push back as best as possible (you won't have morg's or malz's pushing power but it's better than e which is a single target damage).

* If it's a range with decent or high pushing capabilities (tf, ahri, kennen) you want to consider whether you want burst damage (maxing e) or harass damage (maxing q). With the unique itemization that I'll be explaining in the last bullet you can go either or with excellent results.

* q can be used as ranged harass. It does not have to hit the champion directly as it can be used to bounce off creeps. This is why it's important to know that the bounce ranges from 2 at first leveling and 6 at max leveling. This is because you want to raise the chances of the blade bouncing to the opponent thus using it on a minion with a champion near it at a certain time when there are not that many minions alive will increase the chances (up to 100%) of the blade bouncing to the champion. Also it's important to know the bounce radius. Not the ability radius. It is shorter from my experience (around 300-400 range). Basically, it wont bounce from a melee to range creep if they were attacking at max range on single point (this is also around the distance of your ability range). So the distance has to be shorter than that. 

* w at lvl 4. This is a must/situational. Must when you max q since you want to use it as a harassing tool for full damage and extra damage on your q. extra damage works on all abilites too including e. 50%hp reduction is good too (this does not scale so this is why it's ok to max w last but still have a strong skill set). Also it's a good damage reduction skill which is why it's so strong against mid.

* e. not much to say about this skill. Combined with flash it is an awesome get away tool or a kill securing tool. Always remember to be nearby a ward, minion or ally in case of sudden wild enemies! and keep a ward or two (or 3 or 4 or 5 in your inventory). 

* ward. always grab 1 or 2 (or 3 or 4 or 5) wards after you back the first time. I tend to not ward any areas because I think it's pointless unless you're going for a kill in lane and more often than not, your ward will time out b4 you even want to go back and buy. If you are planning on killing the opponent and make aggressive plays, than warding near enemy wraith and bushes near blue is essential. You usually do not want to use e for last hitting unless you're near your turret because that sets you up for an easy gank. You will want to hotkey your items so that it's in a comfortable reach in order to quickly place a ward and leap to it. 

* Ult. Can be interrupted midway so positioning is important! What I'm saying is play like a scared 5 year old girl. Go into team fights late. Allow the enemy to use their cc and then go in during maximum chaos to be able to use your ult to its fullest extent. You also cannot be seen when you ult in a bush. It is also a good method of detecting stealth or nearby enemy (if they're in a bush). However keep in mind the range is really small. Saw a play by scarra where he was in the blue enemy wolf jungle where he ulted along the left wall as the enemy were chasing one of his team mates through the lane on the other side of the wall. The enemy just melted like butter. Pretty sight. To this day, I call plays like those, THE SCARRA PLAY. I also caught many people backing to their nexus in a bush with the ult. Remember, you dont need vision. As long as your ult sign pops up, its good and ready to go. 

* Passive cd reset! This is what makes katarina, KATARINA. Gaining a reset after a kill is very gratifying. This is also where the sick katarina plays and the PENTAKILLS happen. After every assist or kill, her cd is reduced by 15 seconds. This generally means that qwe will always be up again after a kill or assist (w might still have small cd). Later on in the game, you can ult several times (i ulted 4 times once within a minute or two while team fighting and chasing down ppl). Also, this makes her a very ""divey"" champ. Dont be scared to be aggressive and dive with her (flash if you have to) as long as there are minions nearby or you have a ward. you can kill, instantly get reset on your e and then shunpo to nearest enemy or allied minion or place a ward and shunpo to it. You wont get hit by the tower more than 2 or 3 times so make an educated guess on how much hp you have and GO FOR IT!

* Ganking. VERY ESSENTIAL IN PLAYING KATARINA. You will tend to snowball after first blood. So helping other lanes snowball is essential in winning as you will not be able to carry late game effectively. One method of ganking I found out was that your lane ganking is VERY STRONG. if the minions in bottom or top lane are held in mid way, you will be able to creep through the bottom bush. Once your in the bush you can place a ward in the other bush and shunpo without being seen by your enemies. This way you can effectively gank bot or top lane and surprise your enemies. Also there is another method which is more difficult to explain without having to show an image so if I get a good response on this guide I will spend more time on this. 

* Now finally the good part. Itemization. What people dont realize is that katarina's early burst is insane. So what I do usually with katarina is grab one or two doran's blade. Why doran's blade? Well your q and your ult scale off ad pretty well and it also gives you hp! So it's an excellent item. Plus it gives you sustain (lifesteal) albeit small but it still helps. Also they allow you to last hit better with auto attacks under turret. I feel that going right into hextech revolver makes katarina squishy but going dorans will give you both damage and some tankiness.Another item I found really effective is haunting guise. This item is crazy on her. Not only does it give her ability power and health, it gives magic penetration! Even through mid game, this item is effective since magic penetration in nature scale as game goes on. Couple haunting guise with abyssal scepter and magic penetration runes, you will be dealing true damage to your opponents and since you're an assassin, you generally aim for ad carries and ap carries who have absolutely no magic resistance. I will still sell huanting guise towards mid-late game with another item that gives more ability power as I do prefer burst and instagibbing squishies. What I consider must have items: doran's blade (sell later), haunting guise (sell later, but usually game is over b4 you get full items), gunblade, sorc shoes zhonyas hourglass, rabadons. Situational items, abyssal scepter (against high magic damage team), rylais (if you max e first, very good to have as it allows you to be tanky and go in and deal damage without the fear of getting bursted. You may or may not switch this out with gunblade), guardian angels, void staff (against heavy mr team).

I love playing Ahri. Played her since first free week and bought her promptly afterward. I have a lot of success in going mid and maxing Q (the orb, for those uninformed). I find that the ability to farm it provides, the long range (directionally specific) poke it provides, and the true damage are all great reasons to max it.
However, I've heard some people (redditors and otherwise), say that maxing her W (fox fires) works just as well if not better. The logic is sound: fox fires don't push the lane when you use them to harass, they prioritize champions (can't miss if you're in range) and they do good base damage + the scaling is good too.

Despite this, I almost never find myself even TRYING to max W. I either need the farm, the quick E + Q long range directional poke... etc. Does anyone ever max their W on Ahri, and if so, against WHO and WHY?

the Problem is, sometimes i run into a situation where i don't know where to do.

in this particular instance, both me and my enemy picked a early kill-dependant solo top - i had shyvana, and he had wukong. at Lvl 1 we were evenly matched, but by some stroke of luck, genius, or just stellar timing, he stealthed JUST at the moment i ignited him. well, you know how it goes, i die and get instantly flamed (there's really something wrong with a community when noone can talk about a lucky or good wukong, but only about a 'bad' enemy). when i come back in the lane, wukong is 3 level and 30 farm above me, with 2 doran's blades, boors and pots. all i have at this point is boots, doran's shield and pots.

now, i don't know what to do here. if i ask my jungler for help he will say ''go QQ, i'm not here to babysit you'' (and while i agree he isn't, when something is out of my control like this i can't help but give the jungler part of the blaim, not for that first death but for not coming after. ) If i try to farm, he will harass me down in seconds and kill me. if i DON'T try to farm, he will either kill me with his jungler under the tower (since he's ahead anyway) or i will be zoned extremely.

honestly, i don't know what to do at this point. sure, you can say get a better jungler that actually ganks the worst-going lane within the first so-many minutes, but i can't exactly expect epic plays from my Elo Range ( i got out of unranked at 1240, now i'm around 1100). sure, you can say pick another champion, but i can't never have a bad match-up, there WILL be times likes these when i am forced to be second pick and be counter-picked. what i want to know if there are any solo top players who know what i'm talking about and have an idea of what i can do to help the team at this point.",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_pej2s,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/pej2s/need_to_be_a_better_solo_top_player_what_do_i_do/,

I've not tried this out in a game, it's just a random idea that came to me.

But basically Sion's strength comes from taking your health with Stun+Shield combo, pushing the lane to the tower, and then ganking the other lanes.

My basic idea is take Sivir.

The stun problem: You have a spellshield (Admittedly long cooldown, but if he uses it too much, he's gonna become OOM)

The push problems: Level up ricochet. Every time he leaves lane, push straight to his tower.

Rune wise I'm thinking AD red and quints to get the most out of ricochet early, mana regen yellows because of how much mana you're using, and attack speed blues just because.

EU meta). This meta got some obvious pros and cons, and has quite some impact on the champ select. Basically there are only minor variations - if you stick to this meta - in the overall team composition (e.g. double caster instead of caster+meele for mid/top).

That said you can assume in most of the cases the enemy team will have 1 AP, 1 Support, 1 Jungler and one ranged AD, with Support+ranged AD going bot.

So my question is: What would you think is a possible *different* Metagame to beat the current ""mainstream"" Metagame?

And now before you simply state different team compositions that can/might/will work, I would be more interested in a possible solution that reflects more general terms. To give an example I'll roughly explain one of the possibilities we are working on right now:

We tried quite a few things so far, and the ""best"" we have come up with so far was to have a double mid, with two solo sidelanes. As we are still experimenting I would like to add that the success with this might also be the fact that most enemy teams had no to little idea how to deal with this, which threw them off balance. 

Short summary to this metagame:

* With two people in the mid lane you got a pretty nice jungle control, as you always got one who can savely run off in any direction to either counter-jungle, harass their jungler or simply help our jungler.
* The 2nd mid laner can easily run off to one of the sidelanes, and depending on the timing you can either pull off two ganks (top and bot) or one major gank.
* Dragon control is pretty much similar to the current EU Meta
* With two mid you need to have one strong laner on the bot lane, able to handle a 2v1 lane. **But** on the other hand you force the enemy team to handle a 2v1 lane too, and depending on their team comp they *might* have a problem with that.

Overall more flexibility, but you rely on at least one strong laner to get a clear advantage.

TL;DR: What would you think is a possible *different* Metagame to beat the current ""mainstream"" Metagame?",,False,,t5_2smhl,False,,,True,t3_ijx5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/ijx5m/how_to_challenge_the_current_metagame/,
1376421454.0,16,self.LeagueofLegendsMeta,1kapk8,Jarvan Support?,wabi44,24,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueofLegendsMeta/comments/1kapk8/jarvan_support/,"So I've been trying out J4 as a support champ in Soloq bronze/silver. My main support used to be Leona since I typically like disruptive, aggressive, and tanky champs. I understand that J4 is better in other roles (he is my main jungle), but there are times in SoloQ when you have to play support anyway. 

There were two problems I had with Leona:
1) Mobility -- you can quickly initiate on the enemy, but no way of getting back out, or just getting out of sticky situations in general

2) Carrying -- if one of your teammates afks for a while, or your team is heavily down, you are basically at their mercy. She doesn't farm fast enough if you need to step up, and her natural dmg is pretty low since she can't proc her own passive.

Jarvan seems to do much of what Leona can do, while addressing these issues. 

He has: 

* Great CC (knockup, aoe slow, ult trap)
* Gap closers
* A passive that is great for trading/harrassing in lane
* Strong burst dmg combo even without any items
* An amazing skill in the form of his E. Jarvan's flag gives him an armor passive which is great in bot lane, an atk speed aura which helps your adc, and casts vision around it so you can use it to check bushes. 
* Fast farming (midgame) if you need to step up and carry. This extra gold allows him to be more useful late game since I can usually farm out at least one mid tier ad item or just extra tanky items. 

To me, his biggest con is actually having mana issues in lane. I find myself having to buy multiple mana potions on my second time home. Against AD heavy teams I like to build Frozen Heart. The Glacial Shroud solves almost all my mana problems early. 

My typical support build:

* Start: Rejuv bead, 2x green wards, 1x pink ward, 2x health potions
Philo Stone (if losing)

* Sightstone

* Emblem of valor (if losing, or if aegis is needed) / Boots

* Mobi upgrade

* After that, I try to build 1 defensive item: giant's belt, glacial shroud, or warden mail depending on matchup

* And 1 mid tier offensive item: Wit's end (against AP), or Cutlass (extra slow, lifesteal), or brutalizer

If the game goes even longer, I finish my defensive item into sunfire, frozen heart, or randuins. And then finish Bork or BC, or if I got wit's end, i'll build something else, like a phage. Normally I won't get the chance to finish the higher tier items since I'm buying wards and oracles in the meantime.


What do you guys think, and what are some ways I can improve upon this build?

Namely, I'd like to hear your opinion on why they are currently unpopular or seen less. The ones I'm curious about are:

* Soraka - lowest pick rate out of any of the traditional supports not named Karma. I feel like it has to do with her extremely high mana costs on leveled heals
* Alistar - also &lt;10%, like soraka, and he seems to have not been popular since the nerfs
* Nautilus - he feels like he fits somewhere between Leona and Blitzcrank, both of whom are currently popular supports. His ult is pretty terror imo, and he has terrifying level 2 potential (auto reset + attack modifier + hook + passive also adds a bit of oomph to his burst, giving him a free extra 28 damage if he procs it on both enemies in an engage)
* Fiddlesticks - I guess his passive is wasted which is a fairly big deal, since few ADCs will often pack heavy magic damage (Corki, Trist, &amp; Kog are the heavy magic damage ADCs, none of whom are very popular atm)
* Zyra - Personally my favorite support. I understand she offers no sustain, but her kill/poke/zoning potential is insane (imo). 
* Morgana - rarely seen at any point as a support, but I don't understand why, because her shield is insanely strong vs current picks such as Lulu, Sona, &amp; Janna and her snare is more devastating than any of the aforementioned's CC as a basic skill. I would assume it has something to do with the fact that her ult practically requires Zhonya's to be effective? Imo she feels like a more defensive version of Zyra
* Elise - I don't own her nor have I ever played her, but I got lucky enough to be queued up with Spellsy one game and he raped with her. I could see it being very strong, especially since she has access to her dual-forms pre-6, giving her poke, CC, and burst. 
* Lux, Ori, Nida, Cho, and Zil also come to mind, but I'm very unfamiliar with most of them as supports.
* Kill lane supports? Lee Sin and Jarvan IV both possess kits capable of simply destroying the enemy bot lane with their mobility and burst, while both offer CC and at least *something* to their ADC. 
* Has anyone ever considered Cait support? I know that's probably a really weird thing to suggest, but solely with her traps and highest base auto range in the game, I feel like she would be a very capable harass+zoning champ, maybe running ArP so that her harass that much stronger? I understand she would have little to offer later in the game though, but she still offers pretty much the best early tower and lane pressure in the game.

So I want to know what you guys think about the how to play Irelia at her strongest potential.

**Skill Order:**
R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;E or R&gt;W&gt;E&gt;Q

**Q&gt;E pros:**
* 2 seconds less cooldown (14 sec lv l1--&gt; 6 sec lvl 5)
* 30+ physical damage for each level up (30,50,80,110,140) 
* Stick on the carries 
* clean up a team
* chasing ability
* Deals 1.0 AD ratio

**E&gt;Q pros:**
* Does substantial damage comparing to Bladesurge (2 times more damage at all levels 140&gt;280)
* Duration is longer by 0.25 seconds each level up for stun and slow (1 second lvl 1 --&gt; 2 seconds lvl 5)
* great ability to control a 1v1 situation
* Stun is the one of the best Crowd control in the game IMO

The order will probably depend on who you are against, how you are doing in lane etc, but what if it's an eqaul lane? I want to know what you guys think about the skill order in a situation like that. 

**Item Build**
This can obviously differ depending on the lane and/or team match ups, but what are her core items? What is a must buy on her? What should you rush First or Second?
My typical build for her as of now is rushing cutlass than BOTRK, get tabi or mercs depending on their team comp, then I get a Randuins for the armor against the ADC.
Get Zephyr for more attack speed. And I get a Warmogs and/or SV for defense. Maybe if I am a threat a GA.
* What other items should be on my list?
* Is Triforce still a good items for her? Or is it just not worth it anymore?
 
I want to know you guys build Irelia and your preferences. Thanks in Advance :)

I don't mean how not to be toxic in a bad game, but strategies and practices that can be implemented in a losing game to potentially turn it around.  
  
I've noticed that at my level (Bronze I) that people are pretty good at winning, but don't know what to do when they're behind - be it losing lane, or the game as a whole.  I'd like to get some input from higher ranked players on how to handle this so hopefully we can all improve.  
  
Some obvious tips that I can think of:  
  
* If you're losing lane, don't attempt to harass and don't go for kills, but focus on getting what CS you can, and *don't die.*  It took me a while to get used to, but staying in lane and giving up some last hits, while still staying in EXP range is a lot more beneficial than getting those few CS but giving away a kill.  
* Know when a tower is lost.  If you see an unmanned tower being pushed, take note of how much HP it has and how far away you and your teammates are - if you don't think you can get there in time to save it, don't bother trying.  Push another lane or objective instead.  
* If your tower is down, help other lanes.  Many times I see (especially bot lane ADC) people lose their tower, but stay in lane farming while their opponent roams.  The extra farm is good, but if you're letting the enemy roam, you're likely enabling deaths by not also doing the same.  Clear enemy creep waves when possible, but don't stay in lane too long. You're both hurting your team, as well as putting yourself in a dangerous position.  You can come back and take their tower later when you have backup.

Back in Season 2, Udyr was by far my favorite jungler. I haven't played him that much in Season 3, but with his recent buffs, I'm going to start playing him again.

The core build on him used to be something along the lines of philo &gt; hog &gt; wits &gt; tank, or something similar. We don't really see GP10s on junglers anymore, and wits was nerfed pretty hard.

I'm thinking the following items would be pretty good to get in the jungle:

Aegis: Cost efficient defense

Locket: Cost efficient defense

Spirit of the Elder Lizard: Synergies nicely with tiger DOT and phoenix

Shurelya's: Initiation/Disengage, gives you mobility you desperately need

Iceborn Gauntlet: You will get plenty of procs, helps to lock down the enemy team

There are a few others, but these are the main items I think I should be aiming for. My issue is, which ones, and in which order?

I know most people go 3/9/9/9 with quints, marks, seals, and glyphs. However, let's take a hypothetical situation. Say I'm making a rune page, and I want Quints and Glyphs of ability power, marks of magic pen, and seals of armor. For the sake of discussion, let's narrow things down to the glyphs and quints. Most in this situation would take quints of AP and glyphs of scaling AP. However, would there be a benefit to taking some glyphs of flat AP and some of scaling? Obviously, the flat AP is more helpful early game, while the scaling pays off later. That said, mixing the two would lead to a stronger early game that simply using scaling, but the early game benefit wouldn't be as strong as with flat AP glyphs. On the other hand, you would still gain the late-game benefit of having scaling AP, but it won't be as great as if you went all out on scaling glyphs.

In terms of numbers, 9 glyphs of flat AP would grant 1.19 x 9 AP, leveling out to a bonus 10.71 AP.  9 glyphs of scaling AP would give an initial advantage of only 1.53 AP, but at level 18, the bonus would be raised to 27.54 AP. If one were to mix these glyphs in say, a 5:4 ratio of scaling:flat AP glyphs, the early game bonus would be almost half that of the bonus from flat glyphs, but still almost five times the initial gain from scaling glyphs, equaling out to 5.61 AP. The end game bonus would be 20.06, which is almost twice the bonus granted by only flat AP glyphs, but it's only about 2/3 of the level 18 bonus from only scaling glyphs. Basically, this sacrifices some of the early game bonus of flat AP glyphs and some of the end game bonus of scaling AP glyphs for a mix of each.

+6% movement speed
Item cost 	1900g (735g)

I figure the reasoning why people don't buy it (or Sightstone for that matter) is they feel it slows down their builds. Help your dumb team out, show them that they indeed should not run into that jungle, get Twin Shadows.

Her q is getting a bug mana cost increase,  and her e is getting
A slight mana decrease.

I Main elise top, and i'm one of the top 10 in games played on her,
Also the only one with above 60 win rate on her.
My nickname is EmperorOfNothin.

Any way,  I was thinking of how you can counter that nerf, 
alot of her Top power is the ability to harass with q ,
 its what makes her do good
Against top sustain beasts as chogath , garen and ad nidalee.
Without that ability and running oom quickly it might be a problem.
So, what can you do to counter that?

I'm thinking between tear rush (7 abilities stack that quickly), catalyst into roa or rushing frozen heart, or chalice.

But I can't decide what's optimal on her, 
I never rush roa on her
 because if you want to give it time to stack 
you need to rush it (singed style), 
but the diff is that singed is a late beast 
and elise is mid game beast,
 to really have an impact you need sorc shoes and hunting guise + an AP item (rylis/abyssal).
If you'll be rushing roa you might get stuck with not enough dmg.

Tear on the other hand will give you mana quickly (all no mana spider skills stack it quickly), but I never built archangel on Elise due to her little mana pool, and its quite expensive.

I don't like fh on elise,  I usually build sorc -&gt;huanting-&gt;ryalis /abyssal then tanky or defensive like warmog /sunfire . Then more Mr or def depending on who fed. I generally like my elise on 4k HP at late. And an item which gives me only armor with all the arp and black cleavers from the bruisers is not something I want on my elise.

Chalice seems interesting choice though it costs more then a tear, my number 1 problem is the fact there's nit much AP going around right now, so mr seems a waist.

So? Am I panicing for nothing? Is the q mana cost is not sagnificent enough to build a mana item? I'll be happy if you could shine some light.
Also if anyone got any Elise questions as someone with over 300 games on her on top, I'll be happy to answer anything.

As most people know, Kayle's Righteous Fury ability is considered ranged, and is a splash damage ranged ability that also applies on hit bonus magic damage. As Runaan's Hurricane applies on hit effects, this makes the splash that more effective by applying extra damage to those around her target.

Here is the items I was thinking of. I don't claim to be a genius or anything, and my League skills and item knowledge leave much to be desired, so if you have any alternate item suggestions, that would be fantastic.

Runaan's Hurricane - The gimmick of the build

Rylai's Crystal Scepter - Core item - I'd build this every time on AP Kayle, it will permaslow your target and anyone close to them. With the Hurricane, this will (read: should) apply the single target slow to 2 additional targets with your auto attack.

Sorcerer Shoes

Lich Bane - Probably not the best item on AP Onhit HurriKayle. Also, it's unclear if the bonus damage is even applied to the secondary targets.

Nashor's Tooth - More AP and Attack Speed, and some cooldown reduction

~~Athene's Unholy Grail - Not entirely sure with this, but if you are playing Mid, then it's probably needed to keep your mana at a reasonable levels. Plus cooldown reduction to spam your Fury.~~ **Athene's is pretty useless on Kayle, other items give you all the regen you need.**

Rabadon's Deathcap - I heard you like AP

Liandry's Torment - I'm pretty sure that you will get the double burn with Rylai slow, and since you are doing aoe autoattacks, I'm pretty sure that it will give the full effect to 3 enemies.

Malady - Pretty great item on this sort of build, shreds even more MR and Armor, not to mention AS and AP.

Again, if you have other item suggestions, it would be great. I'm giving no promise that this will work, I'm just posting it here so that more experienced players can criticize it.

On my last weeks I've been incresing pretty much my elo. at 1200-1500 I didn't really care about ""first pick top/mid"" even if they counter, playing ADC (even when i sux) coz I could manage any lane, but now my games are really hard for me and I've been found myself with the duty of supporting.

Well, on my last games, i've been starting with Flask on almost any support, and I try to do my first shop around 700-1000g. When I look at the shop and I see the Philo Stone at the same cost of Sight Stone, I dont even think twice and I just go for the Sight Stone. IMO, the nerf to Philo is absurd, and having 2(plus 2 more) wards its just too much compared to a very little health/mana regen, and the gold that its lost from the Philo GP10 passive, its about **300G!** (at least 150g) on every recall with the 2-4 wards of the Sight Stone. Most of the time, I didnt even buy Philo's at all...
But.. who the f*** cares about what I think? Im here just to know what do you ppl think about this items and get some feedback. :)

-It's Sight Stone ""OP"" or just too cheap to buy?

-I've seen a lot of supports even junglers going Philo Stone on competitive gaming... It's still such a viable item for early game? even with the nerfs and having the Spirit Stone out there? (oh man another stone, this could be a fight for another topic...)

-Do you think Philo need a little buff? or maybe the Sight Stone need a nerf?

-------------------------
The question is, when it comes to the jungle, yeah you have Malphite, and yeah, Amumu is around once in a while as well. The question is, how does the community feel about some of the other junglers I use? Is there competitive potential in a few I am considering? I'd like some honest opinions before I time dump into figuring out how to properly play them. 

I'm looking to expand my jungler list of champions that can do the following:

- Be Tanky
- Initiate
- Gank well from the start
- Make a heavy impact throughout the game
- Can build to be a heavy damage component if necessary, but usually a tankier initiator or disruptive force 


So far my list of junglers that can meet the criteria are:

- Jungle Tank Darius (surprisingly effective, good at a fast level 3, devastating at 6+)
- Malphite (obvious)
- Amumu (obvious)
- Nocturne (initiate while tanky)
- Nunu (counter jungling 101)
- Dr. Mundo (I think he might be better top but he can push people around in the jungle)
- Jax (has to build more tankier than just 'lol shoot my gun with a rageblade on my back gg)
- Skarner (Starts off slow, great team fight presence, 6+ obvious what he does)
- Fiddlesticks (I feel like his initiate ability makes up for his lack of being tanky whatsoever)
- Lee Sin (As a jungler, he can transform into many roles, Support, Assassin, Tanky Initiate, almost invaluable.)
- Olaf (I feel like he can do a lot, and everyone in the elo I've been playing with, which is roughly anywhere between 1300-1600, are generally very surprised what he can do when he pops his ult and runs into an adc and presses e on them, past level 7.)
- Mao'kai (Initiate, an ult that makes people take less damage, relatively easy to counter jungle with, especially with proper sapling use)

My community tends to play very light assassin like play, and when season 3 started, I decided to stick myself in the jungle just about full time, so I'm looking for feedback. Of course there's other jungles that are just plain good, names that come to mine are:

- Eve (I would rather just see her mid for her lane presence instead of wasting her in a jungle right now.)
- Kha'zix (See above)
- Zed (Better off top lane)

But these are jungles that tend to be very squishy, and can't quite initiate on their own, which hurts my community's team play. And of course there are junglers that I had relied on but since have shelved between the season transitions including:

- Alistar (his jungle is just too slow)
- Master Yi (Just a clean up dunkmaster, he's fun, but can't walk in with an immediate presence unless really fed.)
- Diana (Wildly overnerfed in the previous patch.)
- Sejuani (I just feel like she's just way too slow, even Voli seems to clear a bit faster than her)
- Fiora (There's just better choices for being a lightweight ult abuser)
- Gangplank (The presence in ganks just hasn't been the same since his passive got nerfed, level 2 red gank top is fine, but what after that? One-crit-pony?)
- Kayle (Kind of a support-ish Jungle. I really want her to work again, but after the whole impact of her Q I find it is very hard to play her effectively from the jungle without simply being a DPS/Support ganker which all too often requires your lane that you are ganking to already be winning.)
- Pantheon (It feels like if he doesn't garner 3 kills in under 10 minutes he's just always playing catch up, and it's a long way back for him, he can't tank particularly well. his tool kit says, 'assassin,' but when he can't get to that point he is rather useless.)
- Renekton (He was fun in season 2 but he's just kind of irrelevant right now unless fed quickly, as I said above for pantheon.)
- Tryndamere (He was good for low elo stomping, much like Yi was for me when I wanted to rush season 1 Silver, and I was able to do it with relative ease and little effort, these days people have figured out how ignite works, and you almost want to take cleanse, but you change your mind for flash, and it all goes to hell.)
- Rammus (Just seems gimmicky, can snowball if used correctly, but I feel like there are overall better choices for jungle tanks.)

Champions I am considering learning to add to my list of reliable jungles:

- Cho'gath (He is seeing heavy play in Season 3 Qualifiers right now, seems like he can do exactly what you want)
- Volibear (Just seems.. so tanky. I worry about his clear time.)
- Hecarim (Is fast into lanes pre 6, after 6 he just seems like the track star you wanted on your team throughout all of high-school)
- Jarvan 4 (Being played in S3 Qualifiers as I type this to combo with MF. If you have an MF I feel like he should be considered just for how he can warp a team fight while MF is wildly firing bullets everywhere)
- Nautilus (That ultimate is an initiate on its own if used properly)
- Shyvana (Fast with a w, ultimate can split a team fight into a 3v4, 4v4 that you can pick who is removed from the team fight with you.)
- Udyr (I hear things that he is getting some love soon, is it enough to send him back into the jungle fray?)
- Warwick (I get it, he's meh before 6 but past 6 he's somewhat monstrous. If you like Vi's ult, what if it had a 60 second cooldown, is an argument you see used often.
- Vi (Will this upcoming patch fix her?)
- Xin Zhao (He is squishy at times, but his ultimate can break teamfights in half for your favor.)


So, fellow redditors, how do you feel about this list of champs I want to add to my repertoire? Are there any champs that you see that I like to play that you would just cross right off and ignore? If so, why? Who does their job better? What's some of your experience in Solo q and ranked team play? If you want to know why or how something I think is viable, let's talk about it. (***ASK ME ABOUT JUNGLE DARIUS, IT'S SO GOOD BUT SOUNDS SILLY ON PAPER***.) As you can see, I play a shitton of junglers all over the place. I love the list, but I can't play everyone, I have to retract some to expand.

I'm about a 1500 player, and I have barely touched ranked this season so far, I've been playing a ton of normal games, sitting in normals. My few ranked games have been jungling for me, and working out well so far. (My summoner name is Joeey, you can see what I've been doing on my profile.)

I would like to talk about Vi in the jungle.

I have been experimenting with her and found that she fills a really nice niche in the current meta which is blowing up enemy carries. I believe that, other than Rengar, she has the highest burst potential for carries in the entire game as an AD bruiser. When built correctly she is an unstoppable mid-game counter ganker with plenty of killing potential. She excels in closing gaps and forcing AD carries to either kite outside of a team fight or to disengage entirely and call for a team retreat.

Personally, I believe that Vi is the perfect combination of Amumu and Olaf. Although her jungle clear only really starts to kick in at level 3, she acts like a bandage tossing, Ragnarok-ing beast. If able to get the perfect combination of Q-&gt;AA-&gt;E-&gt;R on an enemy carry then denting blows applies to the carry and her ultimate will deal 450 (+140% additional bonus AD) damage respectively with 20% penetrated AD damage. When synergized with' Black Cleaver' we're talking about some serious damage to carries who stack little more than 80-100 armor endgame.

I like to build Vi in the jungle coring 'Spirit of the Ancient Golem' seeing as she needs to be front-line bruising throughout the entire game as a jungler. SotAG also increases the size of Vi's passive shield by 50 which is a nice little buff for the early game (essentially mitigating an auto attack). With early game health and armor dealt with Vi requires attack speed, damage and magic resistance. So far I only find myself turning to 'Wit's End' because, even though it doesn't provide AD which her skill scale from, it provides a lot of magic resistance for what you pay for and helps her utilise 'Denting Blows' faster on carries.

From here you can decide whether you want to invest in straight up AD. I find myself usually taking black cleaver after 'Wit's End' because of just how much a step-up of damage it provides. This is also true of Brutalizer, an item that synergizes perfectly with all her skills.

Starting in the jungle I like to start with W on the wolf camp and then taking blue using a single health potion. Upon leveling to level 2 I usually decide to level up Q because of the damage and utility it provides in either the jungle or to close the gap for a level 2 gank. I have been considering doing this with Red Golem for her chasing problem but have yet to actually test it.

My runepage consists of Flat AD reds, Armor seals, MR/level glyphs and MS quints. I have considered exchanging the MS quints and AD flats for armor penetration but it completely kills her clear times in the jungle and adds very little to the early-mid game where Vi shines.

My Mastery page is 15 - 15 - 0 focusing on reaching Brute force in offence and Block/Juggernaut in the defensive page. I take Smite and Exhaust because her dueling and team fight potential requires both a gap closer and chance to actually take some hits from the opponent.

TL;DR: Vi has a lot of damage if purpose built. She can trade herself really well for a high priority carry without needing to worry about closing the gap. She lacks very early game and late-game team fight potential and requires very specific itemization. She's also fucking cool.

So I have mained ADC for quite some time now (about 2 months), although I used to occasionally play it when I mained other positions. Every other day it feels like I'm on tilt, I don't know if it's because I get overconfident and just mess up, or because I'm lacking some kind of warmup method. For instance, some games, I will carry very hard (despite decent opposition), and be on crazy scores like 25/2/5, and have a good amount of CS. However, if I log-on and play the next day, I will fail cs'ing, give away FB, and more often than not get very indecisive on who to target when I'm fighting. 

I would consider myself a good player when I'm not on tilt, and although I have only just joined ranked (playing in a 5v5 team). I just wanted to know if anyone out there could give me an insight as to how I can improve on my skills, and maybe a good method of keeping my cool when playing unfortunate games.

I love his kit, he's fun to play, and he can be a real beast of a tank in the late game.

However, everybody knows he's super weak early on. Which isn't *necessarily* a problem... Except that, for some reason, people around my level (Normals only; I'm level 25) are preferring to run duo top and not jungle. And inevitably whoever went top on our side doesn't know how to 2v1. (Which I won't nail them too hard for, because it's legitimately difficult for most match-ups.) Here lies the problem: I want to gank top to take off some of the pressure, but Naut basically sucks until his first big item.

If I wait until level 4 and my first item to gank top, our top laner is usually behind on farm because of the duo's bullying and the gank can really go either way. He might have already died a couple of times and fed them, in which case there's a real risk of giving up a double kill. Even if I'm able to buy him a little breathing room, he just gets bullied out of lane again while I'm doing my next clear.

On the other hand, if I gank any earlier, we *definitely* give up a double kill, because Naut fucking *melts* without items.

Seems like a catch-22. I don't want to just say, ""Fuck you, I'm farming"" if top is clearly losing his lane, but it seems like the only realistic option. As far as I can tell, early ganks on Naut are a really poor gamble, barring a really skilled top laner. (More than you can count on getting while solo queued.) Whereas, if I stay in the jungle and farm or gank lanes that aren't losing, I stand a chance of being relevant mid-to-late game and maybe turning things around when we start teamfighting.

2) If laning isnt going so well I will pick up a wriggles before the triforce for some sustain. (From what I've read triforce is a must have [usually early])

Now I have ruled this down to two things -
1. I am a bad player, I need to understand the game more.
2. Orianna is a very complex champion to start as a ""main""


Now before any of you guys start going all crazy on me let me explain. I am an open minded player, all I want is to improve and become a better player so I can play against the tier of players. I never flame nor do I ever blame players, I always look for anything I do wrong to try and correct. I also try and seize any opportunity given and I always look to make my own oppurtunities to help the team. I watch most the of big tournaments and im almost always watching my favourite mid and streamer - phantoml0rd. That doesnt make me anyway a good player since I am still 1200 elo but hopefully it gives me a positive attitude to have.


Now this leaves me to orianna, she seems to be a very complex champion and not just because of the ball control but everything about her, from item builds like going gp10s to starting deathcap, or even to the when to max w and when to max q.


Now my theory is that I could speed up my rate of learning by starting off by maining a more basic champion.

I am a summoner named Explosion Eater. I have been playing since late 2009. I play primarily ranked games. For three years I've hovered around 1200 elo, with my highest being 1450 and my lowest being 1050.

I have enough experience to know where I excel. I'm a great laner. Unless I'm directly countered, I will never lose a 1v1 matchup, and even when I am directly countered I can win. I'm also a great farmer. In almost every single match, I have scored in the top CS. Lane clearing, last hitting, and split pushing are all things I do well. I'm good at team fighting. I know when and where to use my abilities and what targets to focus.

.

Here's the issue though: I die WAY. TOO. MUCH. Look me up on LoL king. I don't think I have a single champion with a positive k/d ratio. I take risks and I don't back down and while sometimes those risks pay off, a lot of times they won't. I always get ganked when I win my lane and I usually die to it. I always take chances and push, and I will gank when the enemy team is missing and get countered. I'm often the highest level on my team with the most farm and best items, but also with 2x the deaths of anyone else.

.

I need help. How do you figure out when it's a good time to take a risk and when it's not? A lot of people say 'don't push when the enemy team is missing', but isn't it worth it when they turn up in your jungle and you knock down two towers?

I usually buy it after i've finished my base build (Boots, Trinity, Warmogs and Gunblade), and i find the extra attack speed, life steal and hp to be very useful when i dive their carry in teamfights... The CDR is also very useful to stick with their carries and lets me have my W up all the time...

So what say you? Is Zekes herald viable or are there better alternatives?

Getting phage in lane makes sense because it can help you snowball, but I don't get why people build Corki phage -&gt; Trinity instead of phage -&gt; IE -&gt; Trinity. 

Also, assuming someone wanted a phage to snowball lane why not sell phage later on instead of getting a trinity force?

Jungle being either Support or AP *Cassiopeia is a very strong jungler, so is Alistar for example*, and botlane would either be a Bruser/Support combo *IE: Jarvan/Leona* or a Ap/Bruser *IE: Leblanc/Jarvan or Pantheon/Leblanc*
