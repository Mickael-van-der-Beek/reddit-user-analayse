1352056661.0,273,self.bjj,12mgyp,the black belt tied around my waist,charon_x86,302,29,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/12mgyp/the_black_belt_tied_around_my_waist/,"Hey all.... I just wanted to share a bit of my story....The mods suggested it after granting me the black belt flair, and I thought it sounded like a good idea.  Yesterday was a normal Saturday training session except for a few small differences and one big one.  My wife brought my kids to play, typically my daughter just hangs out and runs around and plays with the head professor's daughter.  This time my wife came herself and brought my son too.  I thought it was just so they could all have a chance and play.  Little did I suspect that after granting some stripes, some blue belts and purples I was given my black belt by Professor Rodrigo Lopes 2nd degree black, Gracie Barra Seattle.  I join the ranks.  I graduated, I started Saturday a normal student and ended a professor.  I got it in front of about 40 team-mates and my whole family.

It feels heavy around my waist.  I feel not ready and accomplished all at the same time, I feel proud of how far I have come,  hard I have trained, all the friendships I've made all the time I've spent on the matt.  I also felt a small sense of loss and nostalgia as I hung my brown belt up in my home gym next to my white, blue, purple and medals.

I've learned through this all that jiu jitsu is an individual journey that differs for each person, yet connects us all through the bond of common experience of challenges, emotional and physical.

I started Jiu Jitsu in my early 30's, never having wrestled, never having fought.  A friend who was a Judo brown belt talked me into it.  At the time I was doing a tremendous amount of heavy weightlifting, was about 280 pounds and very strong.  I knew it would be challenging, but thought I could still throw people around or hold my own.  The first time I sparred it was with about a 150 pound purple belt.  He kept me on my back, unable to move, and of course submitted me at will, with the ease of a parent holding down a misbehaving, squirming child.  I instantly knew there was something to the sport, different than any other I had done.  I was hooked soon after.  I became a dedicated student and scholar of the sport.  I worked hard, competed a lot, was persistent, worked through injuries, some quite serious.  I had patience and trained when I could, sometimes 6 times a week, and at other periods of school, business at work or with kids, only 1-2.  I spent about 2 years at white belt, about year and a half at blue, 2 at purple, and 2 at brown and now I'm black.  

What inspires me in the sport, more than those who have been doing it for 10+ years, and are black belts who are multi time world champions, is the white belt who sticks with it.  Who struggles, who persists, who has the faith in the system, his partners and professors, his body and his innate ability and keeps coming back.  I remember back to myself at this time, how hard it was, how impossible it seemed to be a purple belt, brown belt, black belt... how untouchable those people seemed, how naturally they moved when grappling, and how awkward and confused my body was.... not to mention the pain.  There's nothing to bring the body to a whole new level of fitness like the first dedicated 6 months of grappling.  I was barely able to get out of the car after getting home those first days training.  It makes me proud and makes me impressed to see the white belts get stripes, to stick with it, keep a positive attitude and work consistently.  

I was proud to get my black belt, and it certainly represents accomplishment and commitment, however I think I was most proud and most ecstatic to graduate to blue.

to those just starting out, to those struggling at any belt level, I would just urge you to display commitment, positive attitude, patience, trust in your instructors and training partners, read and study and eventually forge your own path to where you feel comfort and at home with the sport.  That black belt will be there waiting for you in time.

thanks, you all for listening, and for sharing the love of the sport!  ",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,black-belt-confirmed,True,t3_12mgyp,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/12mgyp/the_black_belt_tied_around_my_waist/,

Inside this fenced off pen gathered all of the guys in my division, mean mugging each other, aggressively doing burpies, and singing along to gangster rap as it blared from head phones.  We were all here to send each other home but were first forced into a tiny area with almost no room to do our intended warm ups.  After a rush of claustrophobia I sat on the floor, closed my eyes, and meditated on my affirmations.  ‘Everyone else here thinks they’re the good guy, so I’ll be the bad guy.  I’m like Darth Vader so I wear my black gi.  I’m here to ruin someone’s day.  I am the bad draw they didn’t want’.  I waited so long I began considering that they must have forgotten to call me when I finally heard my name.

As I weighed in and got my gi checked, I realized that my opponent had a strange ID card from another country.  He said a few words of his native tongue to his coach and I knew that ‘lispy, whinny Spanish’ meant I drew a Brazilian in the first round.  He wouldn’t be here unless he was good.  My heart started pumping.  I was across the country in this huge tournament, I didn’t know where my friends were and my coach Comprido was away at the UFC in Las Vegas.  Standing there in the weight ins, I started to run through my mind all the excuses I could use after I lose this match, when in the corner of my eye I saw Andre Galvao, one of my biggest heroes.  “Andre” I yelled, “I’m a big fan” he turned around, looked back at and grabbed me by the shoulder.  “Yes” was all he said then walked away but it completely hit a reset button on my train of thought.  I’m not here to lose this match, I’m here because I love jiu jitsu.  They called us to the mat.

In every first match of every tournament I’ve ever done I get hit by what’s called the adrenaline dump.  You lose sense of time, your IQ plummets, you have amnesia for much of the experience.  All your training at the gym cannot prepare you for when your brain goes out the window and you rely on instinct.  About half way through the match I got my bearings together and was no longer so vulnerable.  ‘Slow down’ I told myself, ‘breathe, relax your grips’.  Once I swept my opponent and got on top I felt him start to panic.  This wasn’t supposed to happen to him, but then again he pulled the bad guy in the first round.  I used a lot of energy holding him down as he kicked like a wild deer but I eventually passed his guard, winning the match on points.  With the first one behind me I returned to the still crowded warm up area with a new comfort and focus.  Now it was time to get in the zone.

Right away when the next match started I could feel my opponent nervously shaking.  He probably got a buy and this was his first match of the day.  As the bad guy, I had to use his jitters to my advantage.  I kept my cool but pushed the paced on him, quickly sweeping to the top and passing straight in to an armbar, forcing him to tap.  

During the third fight I lost points when I got swept and had to use my reserve flexibility to get out of more trouble.  I realized that my opponent was one tough guy.  While I hung in there, getting smashed on the bottom, I thought about how I tried hard and I won two fights.  I could go home and Comprido wouldn’t be that disappointed, this being my first big tournament.  Everyone would realize that guy was just better than me.  I thought that till out of nowhere, I heard my friend Bruce from the stands ‘One minute left’.  That made me move.  If only it had been two minutes I would have thought it was too long and quit, but I could push in this last minute and make something happen.  The next time he tried to step around my legs, I followed him and rolled upside down.  My legs landed right how they needed to be to step up triangle choke but it seemed like he didn’t realized or know the danger.  I took a deep breath and unwound, cinching a deep triangle choke.  Grabbing my ankle, I squeezed and got the submission from the trick move, narrowly avoiding defeat.  

In the warm up pen my friends were waiting.  They were all excited for how I was doing while I kept it inside.  If I won one more match I would be farther in at a big tournament than any of the Americans on our team had gone.  ‘One match at a time’ I told them, trying hard to stay cool.  While I waited at the mat for my next fight, I saw my next opponent practice wrestling shots, so I started pretending to practice judo throws were he could see.  As soon as the match started I showed my bluff and immediately pulled him into a deep half guard, a place a wrestler type like him would feel confused.  After a sweep, I snuck to his back and cranked a bow and arrow choke.  My friends cheered from their distant seats in the stands.  I was now deep in the no-man’s land of the late tournament that was unknown to everyone I knew; that is everyone except for Comprido.

After about an hour break I fought this kid in the quarter finals that had a really similar game to mine.  The entire match I felt like I had no control but it was still somehow close.  I swept him, he swept me back, he nearly got a couple of submissions on me.  My teammates were far from me in stands so there was no one to tell me the score but I knew time was running out.  He rolled away as I went passed his guard but I jumped on his back right as the buzzer rang.  As the ref lifted my hand I honestly had no idea what the score was.  For the first time all day I was tired but there was no time for that as the semi final, and hence the medaling round, was next.

I focused on my affirmations.  ‘You are meant to be here.  You trained hard for this.  You were already one of the best in the room before the day began.  And you still are.’  I was already in third place no matter what, but no, I could do this.  

The next guy came out strong, stacking me up on my head after I pulled guard.  He had a scary look; a white dude with cornrows just seemed intimidating.  He pushed me around on the mat for a bit as I scurried upside down in a ball looking for something with no success.  As he tried to stack me up again I got the chance to grab his belt.  Using my grip on his belt I closed a triangle around his neck without either of his own arms.  He tried hard to posture up for a second but quickly tapped.  Afterwards, my opponent asked me what that submission was and I told him I honestly did not know, I had never done it before.  I had never done any of this before but I had faked my way this far.  But I had to focus; I had a chance to take this whole thing.  Luckily the submission was quick and I still had a lot of gas left.

In the other semi final that would decide my opponent, there was a Brazilian and a young American.  After a little back and forth the American got a nasty armbar, the Brazilian flopped around but would not tap and his arm got bent back.  I think I may have even yelled for him to tap before the ref stepped in and saved him from further damage.  After the match the American’s coach cheered, it was none other the Saulo Ribiero, the former Michael Jordan of jiu jitsu.  I had studied Saulo’s book on the plane out to California.  So great, he has a hall of famer for a coach.  But I knew I was always dangerous.
Back to my affirmations before the finals ‘Everyone else here looks like a fool.  They wear their gi like it’s a Halloween costume and pajamas.  I was reborn on a beach in Brazil in this gi.  My gi is still covered in blood, sweat, and amniotic fluid.  I was born to wear this gi’.  They called us to the mat.

It was one of the quicker fights of my career.  Within ten seconds I was flipped in the air onto my back.  Twenty seconds later he picked me up, rolled me, and jumped on my back.  After staving of a lapel choke, mounted triangle, and an armbar for several breaths I had to tap to a combination of the above.  The kid simply out classed me.  If I drew him in the first round he would have beat me then too.  When I realized he still had braces on his teeth I asked him how old he was, 17.  This was his day, and it turns out it was the first of many others for him.  This second place was the best I ever got.  I shook his hand and slinked off the mat. 

I was sitting there on the ground in a daze when Saulo walked up to me.  He told me that I fought well and that I had a lot of talent.  He knew my name and gave me a lot of respect.  He was so humble to even talk to me and I was honored to meet him.

Standing on the second step of the podium, one gets the distinct sense that you are almost literally a stepping stone to the champion.  There were 120 people at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day there are 119 losers.  They cannot all be stepping stones.  They all needed to be here for the sake of the art.  If no one but two people came to the World championship there would be a champion decided, but that would be a dull champion.  We make sure that Jiu Jitsu stays sharp and that if anyone wants that title, I will make damn sure that they are sharper than me.  I may not win every tournament I enter, I may never win a match again but I will keep going out there because I’m no stepping stone, I’m a whet stone.

I sucked. As did everyone when they started. My level of suckage was a bit extreme, though. I am 5'4"" and at the time I was 205 lbs. I had spent the past 10 years doing Extreme TV Watching, I earned a black belt in Tivo, and I wore a butt shaped groove into my couch. I was fat and totally out of shape. I was also 33 years old. Nearly all my teammates were 150-160 lb athletic guys.

But I didn't care that I sucked. For me, I was happy to wear that white belt around my waist. It gave me license to be terrible with no added pressure. Someone had to suck - it may as well be me.

After getting my blue belt, sometimes I feel a bit down on myself for all the holes in my BJJ knowledge and techniques - especially when the girls online say things like ""When a new guy underestimates me I just dominate him in a roll and choke choke choke."" My thoughts: ""aww man I don't dominate anyone"" (not really true, but it's definitely not consistent). HOWEVER, I don't bemoan it or beat myself up.

Why? Because I'm not going to class to be The Best Jiu Jitsu Woman Ever. I'm not even going to class to be The Best Blue Belt. I'm not going to class to Become a Purple Belt. I'm going to class to do jiu jitsu, see people I like, and most importantly, stay active and have a healthy lifestyle. So every time I go to class, I win! Every time some strong 21 year old white belt crushes me, I still win. Even on days when I want to kick someone, I still win.

I also compare myself with myself. Do I move more smoothly? Was I able to do a certain move better? Was I able to identify when to use a move? Does my rolling feel more cohesive? So even though my jiu jitsu isn't that great, it's better than it was before.

Perhaps being ""realistic"" isn't the best trait - I recognize that if I cared more about being The Best Blue Belt or if I started competing that my mental game would kick in and I would very likely progress faster or work harder. But it's okay. I'm so thankful to just get on the mats. I'm so thankful that I am active and not going to die of a heart attack. I'm so thankful that I'm down to 149 lbs. I'm so thankful that I'm putting stress on my body and bones so that when I'm an old woman I will not break a hip because I fell down.

The cool thing about jiu jitsu - I'll be doing it for the rest of my life. Even though I suck now, in 8, 10, 15 years, I will be better than I am now. 

I have a very long term view of things. That's why I've never really minded that my jiu jitsu wasn't great.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,blue-belt-4,True,t3_124sqh,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/124sqh/why_ive_never_really_minded_that_my_jiu_jitsu/,

As this subreddit approaches 8,000 readers, I think it's time to consider disallowing stripe-promotion posts in order to create more room for content. Here me out on why.

Assume that the average practitioner on this subreddit  achieves one belt promotion every 3 years. During that time period, one would receive 4 stripes. If every single reader posted their stripe accomplishments, that would come out to :

8,000 readers x (4 stripes / 3 years) / 365 days = *Roughly 30 stripe posts per day.*

I'm sure we all feel a sense of accomplishment for the hard work it takes to achieve that validation, but obviously the quality of this subreddit would suffer if everyone chose to partake in the karma run. 

I'd love to hear some thoughts on the matter, and hope this self post gets enough upvotes to generate some decent discussion whether this measure makes sense going forward.

Pants and kimono and a belt to keep it together; it is a simple disguise.  When I wear my gi, all evidence of my life as most see it is tucked away in the locker room where it waits for later.  Your wallet, watch, keys, cell phone and all they represent can’t help you now.  That world, and all the people and problems in it, can wait.  The mats we fight on are our temple.   A temple with walls with holes from feet and heads and little curly hairs line the floors.  A temple where all you can bring with you is what you have learned; you cannot fake anything.  We bring our fellow worshippers closer to the truth through pain, suffering, exhaustion and fear.  We know we are strong and we are weak. We learn that you are alright if you can still breathe.   In this temple reverence is evidenced in what you do at this moment, in this place, on these mats.  This is not how respect is won in your street clothes.  On these mats, a nurse can be better than a surgeon; a dope-boy can gain the respect of a cop.  The biggest pretty boy in the gym may run through the guys covered with sleeves and full back tattoos.  The random people I meet have no idea how much time I spent in that gi.  They might not even believe me if I tell them.  With enough time in a gi, you start doing the opposite of sizing people up; you wonder and respect what could potentially be under those clothes.  You know that the man you see is a costume that the true one is wearing.  But when I am fighting, and someone is coming at me hard and your lifespan shinks to the time between breaths, I forget myself and I become nothing but a mirror, reflective of the situation, as nothing else matters; those are the moments that I am just me.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,,True,t3_1eeo0b,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1eeo0b/my_jiu_jitsu_gi_is_my_secret_identity/,

I'm sitting in the hospital write now writing this from my phone so please excuse any grammatical errors.  
I'm a firefighter/EMT, we were sent to an assault victim who had been hit on the head with a bottle.  We were providing pt care and told the victim that he had to be transported since he had lost consciousness.  The patient was uncooperative but eventually he agreed without restraint.  
When we got to the ER the pt became combative.  The pt tried to run off and when I squared up with him he elbowed me in the face.  Then the pt tried to run past me.  I grabbed him by the waist and thought and thought of different possible takedowns.  I assessed that he didn't know any TD defenses so I just ankle tripped him and rolled to the ground with him.  He started flailing his limbs and I took his back, sunk my hooks in and was thinking RNC but decided he would be subdued with a seatbelt hold.  At this point hospital staff had arrived to assist and the situation was over.  
Thanks to regularly rolling I was very clear minded during the entire ordeal.  Had I had no ground fighting skills I may have panicked, over reacted and possibly caused serious harm and could potentially be looking at a serious law suit.  Thanks to BJJ the hospital security footage shows what appears to be minimal force on my end.  

This dirt ball said he's going to press charges and the cops informed him thy he's going to be arrested on felony assault.  

TL;DR BJJ gave me the clarity to use minimal force while restraining a douche bag.  ",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,white-belt-4,True,t3_1cb28s,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1cb28s/bjj_applied_at_work_today_not_a_cop/,

Prior to BJJ coming into his life it was a struggle to get him to try to do things he wasn't comfortable doing. I remember him crying and crying one day in the car because he didn't want to try to buckle his seat belt himself. ""I can't, I don't want to try"" he kept saying.

Yesterday we had BJJ in the morning, so it was fresh in his mind, later that after noon we went out to the store to get some food for the house. He was all about helping me get stuff for the cart. Then this happened:

""I want to get the milk daddy, I can do it"". I said, ok, give it a try, a gallon of milk is really heavy, so be careful, (I was a little concerned, but decided to go with it, its a little less than a quarter of his body weight, that's huge for a 5 year old after all) After struggling with it, giving it everything he had to open the cooler door, take the jug out, and, finally handing it to me to put in the cart, he said ""Do you know how I did that daddy?""

1370349422.0,117,self.bjj,1fnbzg,I am the 2013 Blue Belt Ultraheavy World Champ AMA (went from overweight video game nerd to MMA and BJJ athlete),arkimler,140,23,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1fnbzg/i_am_the_2013_blue_belt_ultraheavy_world_champ/,"Roughly three years ago around my 20th birthday I decided to start working out after 20 years of sitting on my ass, eating crappy, and being obsessed of games like world of warcraft. I remember how tough it was in the beginning. I would throw up every workout multiple times. I just knew if I didn't quit then I would keep progressing despite all of the people telling me differently and the many obstacles in my way. At this time I started watching MMA and I thought to myself that I could do this. It's a perfect sport for me. The thought of 1 on 1 competition in a grueling and extreme sport like MMA always excited me. As stupid as this sounds I think it was because I was always interested in online competition from games and player vs. player environments.

After I got in decent shape (3 months of working out) I decided to try BJJ because my uncle (who is a blue belt and had been training for 6 years at the time) suggested I try it if I want to do a combat sport. I honestly wanted to try a stand-up art like Muay Thai and at one point I almost joined a boxing gym, but I decided on BJJ and it was probably one of the best decisions of my life. This was about 2 years and 8 months ago. 

The harder and more I worked towards getting my technique and physical shape better the more motivated I became. I became obsessed with BJJ just like I was with video games. But this was something more... There was something about the competition aspect that really made me feel alive.

My first competition (Houston Open 2011) I was a young, eager white belt ready to perform. I didn't know what to expect but when I got to the competition facility I was pretty intimidated. I remember my previous instructor coaching me during my match as well as Draculino so I had to perform well. But I didn't. I completely brain farted during my match and lost on points. I felt like shit after that. I remember crying like a little bitch after that tournament lol.

Fast forward to my next tournament. It was a more realistic local tournament to participate in. I ended up winning my first match in Nogi but unable to finish. My instructor at the time gave me some discouraging words after the match because I couldn't finish the guy with a keylock because I again brain farted. This really lit a fire under my ass and frankly pissed me off. I ended up losing the next match in Nogi. But then I came back in Gi and won 3 matches to win Gold. It was one of the best feelings I had in awhile. I realized after that day I wanted to perform and compete in BJJ at the highest level.

Some issues happened with my previous gym (which I'm not going to get into) and a close friend convinced me to try out another academy in the same area (this was a year into my BJJ career). The instructors already knew who I was because I trained there a couple days to try them out. I didn't know how close I'd be now to these new people I just started training with.

After decisively winning a local tournament and a grapplers quest my instructor promoted me to blue (about 14 months training). I was stoked and ready to compete at this new level. Again I got beat numerous times until I started winning at blue.

The reason I got into BJJ was for MMA and I wasn't about to give up on that. I trained all the time for MMA and I begged my instructor to set up an MMA fight for me. He did and I started training for a fight (8 months after I was promoted) and the first two fights fell through and didn't happen. But my third fight camp happened and I won in under a minute with a KO. I was extremely excited and it felt like all my hard work is finally paying off after two failed fight camps. This was last April.

After the fight I bought a plane ticket to LA and signed up for Worlds. This was my first big tournament so I knew that I shouldn't be too hard on myself if I lost. The experience in California was amazing. I was with some of my best friends and we got to see some cool stuff and overall the trip just without competition was really fun. But the reason that we went there wasn't to site see, it was to perform and compete at the most prestigious BJJ tournament in the world. 

The day of Worlds I remember the mutual feeling of our group. My friends and I were on the outside easygoing but we were excited and nervous on the inside. In the early morning most of my teammates competed. I was super nervous just watching them. It was disappointing watching my friends lose their first round and more disappointing seeing them afterwards. I felt helpless watching them from the sidelines. I knew that there was a reason we came to Long Beach and I wanted to prove something to my friends, my academy, and more importantly myself, and watching my friends compete and lose tough matches in their first round made me more inspired to do well because of the step up in competition.

It seemed like it took forever for me to compete. At close to 6 pm I stepped on the mat against a Brazilian Checkmat competitor. I wasn't intimidated by his school. I didn't care. I knew I worked too hard to this point to be intimidated by petty shit. I pulled guard and armbarred him in less than a minute. 

My next opponent got injured previously so he had to back out so I got a lucky bye. Next match I went up against a smaller Ultra heavy weight from Colombia, but he was really experienced (4 years at blue ?). I ended up passing his guard and taking his back and winning on points.

I knew if I didn't give up I had the potential to achieve gold. The next match I had was against a HUGE Mongolian dude in the semifinals. He weighed over 400 pounds and made me look small (I'm 6'7 and 240). He thought he couldn't be arm barred and blatantly just gave me his arm which I snatched onto like a spider monkey and popped. I was ecstatic because this match put me into the finals.

Probably the hardest match I had that day was the finals. Rewatching my finals match with my instructor coaching me from his laptop still gives me goosebumps. The guy I went up against was the favorite to win worlds at my level. He medalled 3 times in Gi Pan Ams and the last two times he medalled it was gold. It was a very close match.

I knew from other competitors that he had a good deep half game which is uncharacteristic of a heavyweight so I took that into account. At the start of the match he pulled half guard and tried to get deep half but I got a deep underhook and crossface and didn't let him underhook my leg for deep half. I tried to pass and open his legs but it wasn't working and we were at a stalemate. The ref gave me a disadvantage for stalling and I knew I had to move. As soon as I moved he swept me from deep half and he ended up in my full guard. My guard is the best part of my game so I felt safe but at the same time I was down 2 with 3 minutes left. I started attacking with triangles but he was able to posture out of them. 

With about 1 and a half minutes left he was about to pass my guard when I saw an opening for an arm bar. I used my flexibility to go belly down and attack the arm. I felt like I might not get it so I had to get points. I transitioned to the back and got my 4 points with under a minute left. He got out of the back after I nearly RNC'd him and we got to our feet. He tried to take me down but I was able to stop him until time ran out. I ended up winning on points 4-2.

This was an experience and a feeling that I could not describe. It's still hard picturing myself as a world champ only 2 and a half years into my BJJ career, but hard work pays off. It's still a very surreal experience to me and I hope I can continue to perform well in the BJJ and MMA arena. AMA!

Our little community (can I still call it little?) has been growing at a faster and faster pace and that has been reflected in the amount of quality content that has been showing up on a daily basis. We now have several well known black belts posting on a regular basis and taking the time to interact and answer questions (Thank you!). 

New people to the art have had their questions answered regularly. Now, that might seem like a ""normal"" thing, but I've seen time and time again in other subreddits where the same or similarly phrased question eventually goes unanswered because it has been answered before (""search function noob""). Here, people still take the time to answer questions which means this subreddit hasn't become ""calloused"" over the years.

It wasn't until I became a moderator last year that I realized just how little moderation is done here. *Very* few posts are removed as a result of the ""hands off"" moderation motto. The up/downvote system does its job well and rarely will threads devolve into shouting contests. Really, this community tends to police itself not by use of force but rather by maintaining an air of civility. 

In short, even though we are growing, we aren't losing the spirit of the art. Thanks go to everyone in this community for making it a nice place to visit. 

Instead of posting ""congratulations"" sentiment below, go train and make a post about what you learned today. No really.

1356749187.0,99,self.bjj,15lte8,bjj has saved my otherwise dismal life [wall of text],OnlyOneStar,125,26,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/15lte8/bjj_has_saved_my_otherwise_dismal_life_wall_of/,"i've never brought this up in this subreddit. my normal comments don't reflect anything depressing, but, I wanted to express how bjj has impacted my life thus far in my journey without giving an autobiography.

four years ago my girlfriend was killed in a car accident (that escalated quickly, huh?). it threw me into the worst depression i'd ever conceived possible -- we'd been together for five years, and engaged for the last year we were together, waiting until were were out of school to move forward. six months later, one of my best friends committed suicide. I didn't know how to cope with life or deal with anything. my grades slipped, going from a 4.2 GPA taking AP classes and doing college prep, to a 1.8. I simply didn't want to do anything. I also stopped being active and gained about 30 pounds over the following years until college.

fast forward to college: I withdrew from a couple of classes my first semester, had poor grades, still couldn't focus. i'd let this thing haunt me for way too long. a friend who practiced bjj told me about it, and introduced me to videos of the sport, and brought me to his gym to watch a few times. i've always been involved in competitive things, loved strategy games, I used to be a huge starcraft player, i've played dota for years, and I love chess and shogi. needless to say, bjj intrigued me greatly, but I couldn't motivate myself to get a job to pay for classes -- that was two years ago.

fast forward to summer 2012 -- I joined my first bjj academy under EJ Ledesma, a black belt under Saulo Riberio.

this sport has literally altered my reality, and pulled me from the darkest depths of my mind. I have had a joy for life like I have not experienced since I lost my girlfriend. I have lost a lot of the weight I put on, I have gained tremendous amounts of self-confidence, and I have shredded any self-delusions I had about life, stopped feeling sorry for myself, and have begun *living life*. 

I don't think i've seen any posts in /r/bjj since i've been subscribed like this, but I thought that I should let you guys know just how much this sport has changed my life. while it isn't applicable/appealing to everyone, I encourage you to tell your friends about it. I personally have gotten two of my friends to join who were out of shape, depressed, heavy smokers and drinkers, people who have felt down on themselves/world is against them, and it has since motivated them to continue with their education and move forward in life.

the ability to come on here and see discussions, interact and engage with people who also follow this path has helped -- not in the biggest way, as we are a relatively small community still, but it's a comfortable level of activity with relatively good content. it has it's moments, but otherwise, it's a nice place to communicate with other people who practice as well. so when I see people bashing others for getting promoted, getting stripes, it really irritates me that, in addition to it bothering you, you took the time to click the link, and reply about how you disagree with it. if you don't like the thread, don't open it. if you don't like the thread, get reddit enhancement suite /r/Enhancement, and filter out common terms such as ""stripe/promotion/promot*"" et cetera, because there are some people who, outside of the gym, are not in the right place in their life, and this stripe has given them the courage to move forward. it's an exciting thing, don't bash it. when someone in your gym gets a promotion, you smile and pat them on the back. do the same here, we're all the same, we're all a part of the bjj family, so let's act like one.

What happened?,sprodigy,111,11,208,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1jvysc/has_your_instructor_ever_had_to_put_someone_in/,"Last night we had a brand new kid come into the class. He was a blue belt but said he mainly trains no-gi. I talked to him and he was telling me how he's been training for 3.5 years, is 9-1 in competition, blah blah blah. He seemed very cocky. Don't get me wrong, he definitely rolled like a purple belt, but there was still no need to be like that.

After class was over, on the mat, he was talking to my instructor about how he thinks No-Gi is better than Gi, and how he's actually a better No-Gi fighter. My instructor (black belt) talked to him about the merits of both and how he thinks Gi is a good overall Jiu Jitsu to learn as well.

This is when things got weird. The kid CHALLENGED my instructor to roll no-gi with him. My instructor kinda laughed and said ""Yeah we can do that, come to Saturday's class""...but the kid insisted that they roll right there. He wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer, basically egging him on.

My instructor seemed annoyed, took his shirt off, and they rolled for about 30 seconds before the kid was writhing in pain. During a transition, my instructor bumped him in such a way that the kid's knee got tweaked real bad. The rolling ended immediately and the kid practically crawled off the mat. Now, I can't say for sure that it was on purpose, but my instructor had absolutely 0 regrets afterwards.

I don't think he'll be coming back for a few weeks, or ever again.

&gt;What does a belt in Jiu-Jitsu mean? I've been asked some form of this question a lot lately. Like one person told me they did not feel they deserved the belt they were given, another person asked me what is the difference between a blue and purple belt and had someone else say they are a blue belt but should be a purple... I'm sure many of you have heard something similar. 

&gt;The truth is: THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL STANDARD IN JIU-JITSU FOR WHAT ANY BELT IS! It is completely based on your instructor and even with the same instructor, instructors hold different students to different standards. 

&gt;Sometimes these standards are based on performance like placing well in tournaments or if someone is able to submit a certain level of their training partners in training. Sometimes the standards are based on having a certain level of knowledge so a test might be given. Sometimes the standard is based on the amount of classes attended assuming that after a person has attended a certain amount of classes then they should have a certain level of knowledge. 

&gt;One of the experiences I had that really made me start to think about what a belt means and who deserves one was after a brown belt test done by Rickson for 8 guys probably around 2008-2009. Rickson rewarded all 8 guys with their brown belts even though I was there and helping to grade and I felt about half the guys failed the test. Afterward I asked him why he gave the belts to one of the guys that I thought had failed and he told me this. This guy was 50 years old had been training consistently for years once a week, every Saturday. He would never achieve the level of world champion in any belt but it doesn't mean he does not deserve to get promoted for his persistence and dedication. This was the first time it really dawned on me that the belt is not even based on performance and level or knowledge. This was a guy that was really strong, and tough, was excellent at making tiny adjustments to defend so he was tough to tap out but had almost no offense at all. He didn't have a huge arsenal of techniques and wasn't necessarily smooth at all either, what I thought would kind of be the standards for a brown belt, those were the standards I felt I was held to. Rickson however made me realize not everyone has the potential to reach the same level but everyone has the potential to become a black belt with hard work, persistence and dedication.

&gt;If you think about it, even within a certain school where everyone was promoted by the same instructor, even among guys with the same belt and stripes no one is ever of equal skill level and training level. Some guys are faster, some guys are stronger, some guys are heavier, some guys have great guards some have great defense, some guys have great mounts or cross-sides, but even with twins their skill level and performance will be different.

&gt;So my message to you all is do not worry about the color of your belt, focus on learning and growing. The most important thing is you are improving as a person and a martial artist, let go of your ego and focus on becoming more efficient with the techniques of Jiu-Jitsu, if you put the time in the belts will all eventually come.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,blue-belt,True,t3_1h1p2o,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1h1p2o/henry_akins_on_belt_promotions/,

I am a 165 lb female, 5'8"", so no shrinking violet. I enjoy trail running, especially in a local park that features some heavily wooded areas with challenging trails. Sometimes later in the evening these trails can be pretty deserted and I won't see anyone else on the trail for miles. I know it is dangerous, but I like to listen to music while running. I know it makes me less aware of my surroundings, but it really helps me maintain a good pace. 

I was running close to dusk earlier this week, listening to music, at a good 8 minute mile pace, when a pretty big guy comes barreling around a blind turn and we collide. I lost my footing and crashed pretty hard. Luckily, I have been training BJJ for a couple of years now, so I tucked and rolled over my shoulder and walked away without a scratch. My ipod wasn't even damaged. The other runner apologized profusely and we all went on our merry way. 

Thanks BJJ.

I am 6'4 and started at 360+ and am currently 235** 

I can’t tell you how heavy I was at my heaviest. Every scale I have ever owned would show an E after 360lbs or the needle would scrape against the top of the scale depressingly.   The first time I ever discovered low carb dieting when I was 19 it took 3 months before I hit the sub 360lb mark, so we can go with that as my heaviest.   
The last time I could remember being thin I was in the 1st grade but by the 3rd I was already the fat kid, although I was still athletic and tall so I never got picked on much for it.  When I think back it’s probably that attitude of I am fat but it’s not holding me back that really allowed me to get as big as I did.  

Here are a few random before pictures at various weights, mostly around the 350s

http://i.imgur.com/rSAI8h.jpg

I had yo-yoed for years.   The lowest I had ever hit at the time was 287lbs but I would mostly bounce between 300 and 350.  I tried it all from diet pills to prescription diet pills to every as seen on tv work out device.  I have my bow-flex coat rack and I’ve thrown my obligatory $100 bucks at the big box gym personal trainer racket.  Nothing worked for me. 

 On  November 19th 2008, 18 days before my 28th birthday, I came to a fairly stark realization.  I realized that  all I ever did in my life was sit down.  I’d sit down and drive my car to work, then make it to my desk and sit for 8 hours at a computer only to go home and sit and watch some tv.  Realistically the longest point of any given day that I’d be standing was while showering. 

I was 342lbs at the time and I decided to make a change.  I did something I had wanted to do for 15 years ever since I saw Royce Gracie at UFC 1 and took up Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  I started November 22nd 2 days later.  Since that day I have not gained weight to any significant degree, and have been able to honestly say nearly every day of my life since that, today I am in the best shape of my life.  
I joined C-Quence Jiu-Jitsu, it was less than two miles from where I worked and from what I could find online seemed legit.  It was a small gym at the time, the mat room was maybe 20x20ft and the warm-up always starts with a jog around the room.  I had to rest after 4 laps.  It was humiliating to be honest, but not one person gave me even the slightest bit of grief for it.  For anyone who’s ever done any sort of grappling they will attest to how physically exhausting it is, but I fucking loved it.  Not only was the sport itself but it was the people there, people my own age who were just as horrible but loved it just as much.

For me the social aspect, the desire to get better, and competing that made this all work for me.  Very quickly my goals changed from losing weight to getting better at BJJ, and when I wasn’t around for a day or two people would ask where you were at.  I was able to lose 70lbs in almost a year and without even trying it seemed.  I would go to BJJ and eat like shit after, never before though to avoid puking.  I still had alcohol a couple night a week, but the weight came off like it was nothing.  But at the 270s I stalled but I didn’t think too much of it, I was still losing just very slowly.  It was competition that made me make the additional changes I needed.

Here is me in the blue at the 2011 AZ international open, before I took my training to the next level. I got a bronze despite losing my first match because there was only 4 competitors. 
http://i.imgur.com/fGtYo.jpg


At white belt I had won almost every tournament I entered save for the worlds.  I was bigger than most of my opponents and I have the gift of super mutant flexibility, even at 350lbs I could put my leg behind my head.  But at Blue Belt that wasn’t good enough, I lost my first match at my first 3 tournaments at blue.  That’s when I started to get serious and got back on the good old keto dieting, and enlisted my friend from BJJ, well call him Travis since that’s his name,  who is a personal trainer focused on fitness specifically for BJJ.  I got better, I used every tournament as a goal.  They kept me focused and I started to do better, a couple bronzes, a couple silvers, and then gold at the AZ international open and Pan Ams.

For anyone who read all of that, thanks.  I’m not sure that I have some great point but I wanted to tell my story somewhere.  But if I could boil my experience down to advice it would be leave your house.  Don’t try to do it alone, we humans need a tribe.

1317648643.0,89,self.bjj,kzbrv,I'm Gay and do BJJ. Would you roll with me? ,defenastration2000,109,20,292,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/kzbrv/im_gay_and_do_bjj_would_you_roll_with_me/,"Quick clarification: This isn't a request, but a serious question. 

I am gay, in a committed monogamous relationship with another man, and have been practising brazilian jiujitsu at a local gym for just over two years now (not too far off blue belt, if I trained more regularly, maybe I'd already have one, who knows). The gym is quite a large one, and is very well known globally, though for reasons that should be apparent I'm not going to say which one. 

On other websites dedicated to jiujitsu and grappling arts, there is definitely a noted stigma against homosexual males practising jiujitsu on the basis that either they're doing it for sexual reasons and trying to ""get off"" from it, or the basis that if a gay man rolls with them in class, they'll all suddenly contract HIV. I personally think both of these are ridiculous, but nonetheless they are prevailing points of view that also seem to be quite common in the gym itself. It's rare to hear a conversation about gay people from the people in the gym, but sometimes it DOES happen, and it makes me very glad that I have kept my classmates in the dark about my sexuality (I am very much ""out"" in every other aspect of my life). 

Essentially, as a result of encountering these points of view elsewhere, I want to know your opinions, and pose a few questions to you guys: 

- If you knew I was gay, and in YOUR academy, would you roll with me? 

- If the answer was yes, would that view change if I was NOT in a committed long term relationship? (I have been single before, and during that period slept with other people, albeit safely. I'm curious about the views based not just on the strange fear of gay men carrying around infinite STDs, but also potentially on the idea that a single gay man would be a ""sexual threat"") 

- If you were to find out that I go to your academy, or have BEEN to your academy, and you have rolled with me, or any other gay man without your knowledge (Considering the gyms I have visited, and that mine is a rather large one, there's probably at least a few guys on here I have rolled with), what would your thoughts on the subject be? This question is for anyone, but particularly aimed at those who feel uncomfortable rolling with gay males. 

- What are your thoughts on Gay men in jiujitsu as a whole? 

Also: feel free to AMAA. 

EDIT: Thankyou guys. Elsewhere I've seen some pretty nasty comments in regards to things like this, but here, not a single one! It's nice to know that negative views on this sort of thing appear to be becoming less and less common in the BJJ community, at the very least on Reddit.

I mainly joined BJJ to get in shape. I started at 27 and had never been particulairly atheletic. I watched UFC a lot and Grappling always interested me, I also knew someone that trains karate and was always telling me about the benefits of training martial arts. 

The reason Im posting this is because of the extra benefits Im noticing from training. From the increase in confidence, to the comradery that I am experiencing in the gym with the people Im training with. Grappling with someone is one of the most humbling experiences ever. Its hard to think you're the shit if you're getting choked by someone 50 ilbs lighter than you. I used to be quite shy around people and afraid to put myself out there and even had a hard time getting in to training as I thought I was going to be judged.
Although I still struggle with this point a bit Im noticing HUGE changes in my attitude and stress levels. It seems like the volume on all the little stressfull things in life gets turned way the fuck down.

Im sorry that this was super long and probably wont be seen by a lot of people but please, if you're reading this, and you're nervous or have some apprehensions about training, push yourself to be better and take the plunge. You wont regret it

TL;DR I was afraid to start BJJ, started in my late 20's and have been surprised at the benefits that it has added to my life not including the physical. ",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,,True,t3_xolew,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/xolew/if_youre_thinking_about_training_bjj/,

Smash w/a :-),ChaosDude,93,12,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1a07mu/a_black_belts_journey_smash_wa/,"I started training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 1999 @ Rafael Lovato Seniors' academy in Oklahoma City. I wrestled in High School, and I loved it. The summer after I graduated HS, actually the day before my 19th birthday, my Mother died of cancer.  

Being the only child of a single mother this threw me into an incredible tailspin.  I tried several types of therapy, both professional and personal and they all helped some, but there was a part of me that remained untouched, unhelped and therefore unhealed.  Until Jiu Jitsu. 

 I saw a ""Brazilian Jiu Jitsu"" sign while out driving (I believe it was on Macarthur Blvd for you Okies) and wondered if it was that ""Gracie Jiu Jitsu"" stuff I saw in the UFC.  It took me months to work up the courage to actually go in.  I literally thought I was gonna have to put on gloves, and step into an octagon and fight.  

I went in, Lovato Sr signed me up, and I started my training.  When I started Sr was a purple belt and Jr was a blue belt, but they were both Jiu Jitsu Gods to me.  Sr had these crazy Butterfly hooks I could never get around.  For me in the sport of Jiu Jitsu I finally found something that scratched that certain itch that no other therapy,exercise, sport etc that I tried could touch.  Still to this day no matter how bad a day I've had, I can get lost in it.

I moved to Boulder, CO in 2000 and started training @ Easton BJJ w/Jay Jack, Nick Kline, Eliot Marshall among many other great training partners and friends. I still love how BJJ creates strong bonds of friendship.

I moved to Brazil in 2005 and trained at Gracie Barra (and a couple other places) for about 2 years.  I got my brown belt from Carlos Gracie Jr.  I moved back and got my black belt from Amal Easton in July of '09. Matt Jubera and I opened Dark Horse BJJ January 2010. 
http://bjjdarkhorse.com/

Being large, strong, athletic, and unusually stubborn I was a terrible student of Jiu Jitsu for a long time.  ""If it doesn't work do it again, HARDER"", was one of my mottos.  Also, ""F@#k you I'm not gonna tap"" (until the bitter edge of unconsciousness/injury).  Sooo wrong headed.  So I was walking around with multiple injuries all at the same time for a while until it finally dawned on me that there had to be another way.  I had to learn to lighten up and get back to having fun training again.  I also had to set about **learning** Jiu Jitsu.  Not just showing up to class and training. These days I probably spend roughly equal time drilling and training, and there is no magic formula for the correct ratio, but I think most people **really** neglect drilling.
 
**The Dude's Top 7**
A few words of advice.  You may have heard this all before, but here goes;

#1 Drill Baby Drill - Any technical shortcomings in your game can be filled here.  Basically ANY game not based on a physical attribute (aka flexibility, strength etc. for flexibility think rubber guard) can be learned if you drill it enough. ButterflyG, SpiderG, De La Riva, etc those are all guard games but  whatever. Let me say that again.  If you drill it enough you will be able to perform it in training (on a long enough timeline, given certain parameters blahblahblah).  Whether or not it is the game best suited to you/what you need to learn is another question entirely.  Granted someone has to show it to you, which brings me to... 

#2 Start and maintain a Jiu Jitsu Journal.  You have a black belt instructor?  Awesome.  When he teaches class write that shit down.  Pretend your life depends on you remembering what the f@$^ he is telling you, because someday it just may.  A journal is an invaluable learning tool. You take notes at school for a reason.  Unless you have a photographic memory you will not be able to remember all the intricate details of that sweet move from now until forever.

#3 Dunno what you need to work on? A simple way to get better is this; Pay attention to where you get stuck.  Keep getting stuck in side control? A#1 is go back to drilling the SC escapes your Professor taught you.  Ask him what he does when someone does x (that thing they are doing that is giving you trouble).  But be specific.  Look up SC escapes on youtube - check sources great competitors generally give good technique,  unknowns maybe yes, maybe no.  But this will at least up your IQ on the subject of what is possible from said position. Drill these moves.  Then drill them some more.  Are you getting stuck somewhere more esoteric?  Of course you are. There are technical answers to that too.  Go find them.

#4 Learn a ""Game"" not a move.  ""A game is 3 or more moves that play off each other.""-Jay Jack  Lets take Spider Guard for example.  Spider Guard is a game.  There are Entrances aka how to get to SpiderG.  Methods of control, sweeps, and finishes.  As you are learning pay attention to the most common counters and figure out what you will do to counter them.  Add finishes or guard passes on to the end of your favorite sweeps, etc.
My friend Brandon Mullins said, ""There is no golden bullet in Jiu Jitsu.""  Any one move can, and over time will be, **shut down**.  Plan accordingly.

#5 Stay healthy.  BJJ is a marathon, not a sprint.  Tap before your arm pops.  Pick good training partners.  Tell someone to chill if they are too agro.  Tell your instructor if said training partner is consistently an issue for you. 

#6 Flow Train.  When I said I still ""get lost in it,"" I meant it.  I become so engrossed in training that I reach a distinctly altered state of consciousness.  You can too.  If you've never done it find someone willing to try it out and train.  At first it can be useful to take submissions out of the equation.  Relax and focus on the movements.  Instead of controlling positions attempt to keep the game moving.  Try to match your opponents technique with a technique of your own.  Avoid stubborn stuckness and **have fun**
 
#7 Are you serious about becoming the best? Then THINK about your game.  Build a [mind map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) for your game, break it down by position. Study instructional dvd's and drill the moves you find therein obsessively until you are seeing the results you want.  Have someone film your matches in competition.  Analyze your fights.  Don't assume it is beyond your capabilities.

There's more, so much more.  How far down the rabbit hole are you willing to go?

I figured I'd post a little bio/information in order to make it a bit different from other promotion threads.  Perhaps other could follow suit so the threads have more content and spur discussion.

1)  How old are you?  How much do you weigh?  

	I'm 36 years old and compete at middle weight.

2)  How long have you been training and how often do you train?  

	I've been training for 4.5 years and for the past year, I've been training 6 days a week.

3) Have you done any other sports or martial arts that have helped your jiu jitsu?

	Nope.

4)  What the best aspect of your game and why?

	I'm good at playing the various open guards, half guard, butterfly, spider guard, x-guard, 
	and switching between them to sweep.   My best submissions is the bow and arrow choke.

5) What is the worst aspect of your game?

	My closed guard not dangerous and I'm working improving it.  

6) Do you compete?  How often?
	
	I compete about 4-6 times per year and I try to do the major local tournaments.

7) What the main reason you train i.e. self defense, MMA, bjj competition, fitness, etc.?

	I train for fun, fitness, and competition.

8)  Have you had any major injuries due to BJJ?

	A tore my LCL and hamstring tendon.  I had to have surgery and I was out for 6 months.

9)  Do you do any training or exercise outside of jiu jitsu?

	As a tournament approaches, I run to lose weight and improve my cardio.  Other than that, 
	I also did a bit of Judo in order to improve my standup game but I had to quit due to the 
	injury mentioned above.

10)  Do you have any tips or advice that have helped you in your jiu jitsu journey?

	I follow the approach of learning 2 techniques from each position.  Once those are committed 
	to muscle memory, I add 2 more and repeat.  Whenever I get to a position, I have something in mind 
	that I'm working on.  This really helps me to develop an 'A' game, 'B' game, etc.

A few minutes in I could tell he was getting tired and he was trying with all his strength to pick me up, turn my legs over and pass when I seized an opportunity to throw up a triangle. As I was locking everything down he stood up. I stayed with him and continued with the lock on the ride up. One moment I was trangled on his neck with my head above his, the next the motherfucker slammed me to the mat. It happened so fast I didn't even realize I had been slammed except that I was now on the ground.

Anyway, my son will watch, or play off to the side.  More and more, though he's been wanting to wrestle too.  So I'll play around with him (you know, helicopter armbars and such suchary) and we have a good time.  I also taught him how to play hide-and-go-seek too, so that's another big game for us.

Tonight, he showed me a new technique, combining BJJ and hide-and-go-seek.  We were playing around, and I was trying to show him guard. He pulls open my baggy lapel and proceeds to try and hide inside my own gi.  (:

http://imgur.com/a/5G7xr#0

1. MAKE EVERY ROLL FEEL LIKE THE FINALS AT MMUNDIAL
	ALWAYS bring your A game. unless your roll hard all the time you arent progressing

2. DONT BOTHER WASHING YOUR GI
	In fact, keep it in a ball in your bag. that way when you put it on its already wet.Nothing like grabbing a guy with a cold wet gi.

3. ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR GI PANTS AT HOME
	Grapple in your top and shorts. Sambo style! when you do that dont fotget to grab the other guys pant legs for all your passes.

4. ALWAYS BEAT DOWN NEW GUYS.		
	That way they know the power of BJJ right away. They need to know how effective it is.

5. IF YOU KNOW A COOL COUNTER TO WHAT THE TEACHER IS SHOWING BE SURE TO SHOW IT RIGHT AWAY
 	Especialy when the instructor is talking. That way you can look cool. By the way, every technique has a counter.

6. ALWAYS USE FULL RESISTANCE IN CLASS.
	Especially when in learning stage. If your partner is learning an armbar for the first time you need to give them full resistance so that they know how that feels. Dont let the get it!

7. IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET SUBBED SWITCH INTO COACH MODE.
	Coach your partner through the rest of the technique. That way you get credit for HIS sub.

8. IF YOU GET TIRED IN A ROLL WAIT UNTIL YOU IN A BAD POSITION TO STOP

9. WHEN YOU GET TAPPED BY A BIGGER GUY ALWAYS TELL THEM AFTER THE ROLL ""DANG YOU ARE STRONG!""
	That way you can blame their win on their strength instead of their technique

10. KEEP TRACK OF EVERYONE YOU TAPPED, WHEN YOU USED TO TAP THEM, AND WHEN IT HAPPENED.
	relive those moments with your classmates before every class

11. GUN AFTER EVERYONE WHO IS A HIGHER RANK THAN YOU
	That way you can put on your belt for tapping out a higher belt

12. WHEN YOU GET A TAP IMMEDIATLY JUMP UP AND DO A VICTORY DANCE
	Make sure everyone in the room knows

13. DROP IN AND OUT OF CLASS AS YOU SEE FIT
	dont bother to do the warm ups. if the material dosent look cool to you be sure to pull your buddy out of the class and grapple on the side of the mat while class is going on. Always do this if the class is covering something youve learned already. Review is for white belts.

14. ALONG THOSE SAME LINGS, ALWAYS SHOW UP LATE
	that way you dont have to even bother with the warm ups

15. WHEN YOU HAVE VISITOR IN FROM ANOTHER GYM YOU MUST PUT A BEAT DOWN ON THEM.
	thats the only way they will know how good your gym is. It is your job to uphold the reputation of the gym.

16. NOBODY MINDS IF YOUR ROLL WITH OPEN SORES.
	go ahead and grind that scab in my face. I dont mind at all.

17.LONG FINGERNAILS ARE A GREAT SPARRING WEAPON
	dont cut them. Toenails either

18. SMALL JOINT LOCKS ARE YOUR SECRET WEAPON
	grab and twist fingers. Do it hard and fast.

19. DONT TAP!
	Dosent matter if that arm is totally straight and you can hear tendons ripping. You might still get out! your pride is worth it.

20. SLAM ON ALL SUBMISSIONS HARD AND FAST!
	That way you get twice as many. Dosnt matter your partner wont have time to tap until its too late. This is bjj, if you dont wanna get hurt than take up yoga or TKD.

21. REFUSE TO WARM UP WITH TEAM MATES BEFORE A TOURNAMENT
	helping others in your gym is for sissies. Besides, you're already warm.

22. wHEN WORKING WITH A PARTNER ON DRILLS, MAKE SURE TO GO 5 OR 6 TIMES WHEN ITS YOUR TURN BUT ONLY LET THE GO ONCE ON YOU
	You have to make sure you get your reps in! One good way of doing this is to ""forget"" to, say, go to gaurd after working in your partners gaurd. If they try to remind you, just tell them your bust watching other people.

23. ALSO WHEN DRILLING, FEEL FREE TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE TO GET UP AND TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS-
	or to interupt two people who are working to start a conversation with one of them. jiu jitsu is for socializing

24. MAKE SURE TO CONSTANTLY CORRECT WHEN YOU PARTNERS IS DOING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR BRAND NEW.
	They'll appreciate the advance guidance

25. WHEN YOU'RE DRILLING NEW STUFF WITH A PARTNER, WAIT UNTIL ITS YOUR PARTNERS TURN TO TRY THE TECHNIQUE, THEN GO GET A DRINK OF WATER, OR PUT YOUR BELT ON/ STRAIGHTEN YOUR GI.

&gt;I was wondering if it would be possible to request a ""no-meme"" policy in /r/bjj - perhaps canvasing the subscribers first. If you check /r/theoryofreddit and similar subreddits there is a wealth of evidence showing that the meme-isation of subreddits tends to kill them, and /r/fitness and /r/weightroom are two great examples of subreddits with the rules in force, and the quality is pretty consistently high.

Meme posts tend to get a lot of upboats (and downboats) and the comments are either banal jokes or complaints about memes. I tend to dislike and downvote them, but I have yet to delete any but those that have zero relevance to BJJ (and I'm being generous in what I'm counting as related to BJJ).

Many of you have probably noticed we've got a guy who has been banned a bunch of times for posting gay porn gifs while complaining about /r/bjj being soft crybaby white belts. What's funny to me is that I would be up for discussing the state of this subreddit with him if he used a few less dudes blowing each other.

People have been wondering what happened to TOTM. I tried to revive it when I first became a mod, redesigned the subreddit theme to promote it, came up with monthly and weekly plans for it, and even shot instructional videos. Despite all that, at best we got someone like UncleSkippy making one big good post (thanks!), and a few people just asking simple questions with discussion ending 2-3 days later. Not quite worth all the planning and effort.

So tell me how do you feel about...

So, a few months ago, I posted on here about testing for a blue belt and I feel like I need to offer some kind of apology. I have since deleted the post, because I had felt dumb even asking about it and after a few exchanges with commenters I realized that I was talking out of my ass. I wish I had left it, if nothing else but as a reminder to myself to remain humble.

Basically, the gist of the post was this: I had been training (99% in no-gi) for about 6 months or so and was feeling good about where I was at, and I wanted to start thinking about testing for a blue belt (ಠ_ಠ &lt;- me, now) However, my instructor was a black-belt judoka and obviously couldn't promote me in BJJ, so I was wondering if I could pop by another gym, test, and walk out with a blue. I was cruising through guys at my gym and had had some success at competitions (a gold and two bronzes in three tournaments). Mind you, again, this is almost all no-gi. I was feeling great about my game, and thought it was time. 

Boy, was I wrong. I actually have a feeling of guilt that I even thought that. For christ's sake, I couldn't even tie a belt without looking like a 4 year old trying to tie his shoes. The fact that I thought I was ready for a blue belt is pretty embarrassing to me now. Since that post, I have had a lot of realizations and have made some changes. I realized that the gym I was training at was kind of a sham. Not at the fault of my instructor- he taught me a lot of good techniques. And I'm realizing that he almost never called our class a ""Jiu Jitsu"" class. He was very careful to call it a ""grappling"" class. The owner of the gym, however, was quite eager to advertise it as BJJ, I'm sure to bring in the money of people who are none-the-wiser (like myself). After a few bad experiences with said owner, I decided to leave. I ghosted the place, telling only my instructor and a few other students that I had become good friends with that I was going to leave. My instructor, for almost the identical reasons I had, as it turns out, was leaving that gym as well. I knew, in my search for a new gym, that I wanted to focus more on gi-work, but still keep up with no-gi. I really focused on finding a legitimate gym with a solid reputation and history. Enter Gracie Barra.

*Talk about getting thrown into a tank of sharks.* Nice sharks, but sharks nonetheless (hmm, maybe ~~octopi~~ ~~octopuses~~ octo-whatever would be a better metaphor). This gym is led by a legit black belt who has coached legit black belts, and is populated with dudes and chicks with belts of all colors. I am much more respectful of the ~~sport~~ art, and I've realized how wrong I was just a few months ago. 

I have since determined that I am not- I repeat **NOT** ready for a blue belt. I have also determined that I am not the one who determines *when* or *if* I am ready for a blue belt or stripes. I am proud to now, after about a month there, tie a stripeless white belt around my waist and just learn everything I can. 


I guess the morals of my experience are these: 

* No-gi grappling **=/=** BJJ.
* You don't ""earn"" promotions just by showing up.
* Promotions aren't that important anyway. It's about learning and just getting better. The comment from my old post that really stuck with me was a quote someone left from Royce Gracie: ""A belt only covers two inches of your ass and the rest you need to back up on your own.”
* Training at a gym with a legitimate reputation is really, really a lot better.
* I am a moron for thinking I was ready for a blue belt.

So, if you're out there and you had read or commented on my old post, know that I've eaten a slice or two of humble pie. And it's delicious.

Edit: I started training under a blue belt, that ran a small gym, in July of 2005.  Starting at 230 lbs., it wasn't long before the weight began to drop and I am at 165 now.  I quickly fell in love with this sport, more so for the self esteem boost and  social aspect at first.  

I ended out growing the first school and began to train with his instructor, Fabio Novaes, for the first 2.5 years of my Jiu Jitsu career.  After taking a job offer, with odd hours, in Tampa I had to switch school to Gracie Tampa.  GT is a very MMA orient school with a good amount of pro fighter(Matt Arroyo, Marcus Jones, Allen Barubee, Corey Hill, Brandon Sene).  After Matt Arroyo moved out to start his own school, I followed him for the convenience of his facility having shower, but quickly realized that it was great choice thanks to his teaching/training style and desire to roll with his students every class.  I now teach a good amount if the morning classes at Gracie Tampa South and am very happy here. 

I competed a lot as a white and blue, and a little as a purple and brown.  Competing in the Pans in 2006 was one of favorite experiences.  The only setbacks that I really had were a bout with a heart condition called pericarditis and a bad broken nose.  

My training regimen goes up and down, but I have been training a solid six days a week for the past year and have no intentions of slowing down.

I have a Conspiracy Kimonos ""Grey"" Gi in A3 that I got with the purchase of the Doomsday Device. This thing is kinda big for and A3. I have A few breakpoints, a Ronin and A few ShoyoRolls all in A3 and this seems to be more like the ShoYoRoll is fitment. It have 2 sun bleach stripes on it but other then that its good. Ive already soaked in vinegar to lock in the color and shrunk it down too. Hit me up with any questions. Ill ship it to you as long as your in the states (sorry, international shipment rapes) free of charge. I love BJJ and am always happy to help a fellow grappler. hit me up with any questions.


*update* sorry guys be pretty busy today. I'm 5' 9""  and weigh in at 205 on a heavy day, big in the shoulders and back. This thing fits like a tight A4. When I'm home ill post pictures with it on me. I'm also giving this away. Not charging anything.  

*update number DUCE!!!* adding some more pictures of what it looks like on me. The Grey one is the Gi im giving away. The white one is a ShoYoRoll and the black is a Ronin. As you can see it runs bigger then most. I wear a L tshirt and 34 x 30 pants (32-33 if I've cut weight) the pants are way bigger then I like and the length is more of a 32 or 34. These are very nice light weight gi's with rip-stop pants. lets find somebody this will fit nicely!!!

I just wanted to say, how proud i am to have the privilege of training and doing life with such amazing people here in Seattle. 

In my first two years of training ive learned a HUGE amount of humility, a MUCH stronger work ethic, what it means to be part of a community of people who will truly push you to grow in all aspects, and a true sense of belonging (not to mention some pretty sweet moves =P )

im convinced, jiu jitsu people are the best people in the world, and we are spreading all around the world.

I've been online in one place or another for a long time and also been training for a long time.  Looking for a different place to post and one of my students actually has a patch from this forum so I figured I'd check it out (I've actually seen some of my work reposted here anyway).  Also trying to get back into blogging a bit more and figured an AMA would help break me out of a writers block.  I've submitted proof of who I am through the flair assignment, but I'm not really that hard to get ahold of I think if anyone needs more proof.

As far as my relevant credentials:

Started Training BJJ in 1996 under Ralph Gracie
Co-Founded OntheMat.com in 1997 with Scotty Nelson
Received Black Belt from Ralph Gracie in 2006 (actually received Ralph's old black belt)
Opened my own Academy Heroes Martial Arts in 2009

Trained, competed, covered Jiu Jitsu all over the world.  Seen lots of things and have a lot of friends.  

Been called both a pioneer in BJJ and a spokesperson for BJJ in America in the past.  (I like to think of myself as merely an articulate guy who's been around.)

Happy Training!

So my family and I were at a bar in Austin for SXSW when a couple of dudes come up to my 17 year old cousin and grab her wrists, trying to drag her away. My bro's gf and I step in and I say to these guys, ""Sorry, dudes, not this one, but good luck on the next."" You know, trying to be cool. Well, we start walking away and the guys start talking shit and then one of them flips me off. This is when I see a blur fly past me- it's my brother- and he tackles this guy down, beating the crap out of him.

Without thinking, I pull my brother off of this guy (he's probably 6'0, 165-170) to stop the fight. The other guy steps in to try to get involved (about same size as my bro). His arms flies past me as he's throwing a wild haymaker toward my brother, who is a considerable distance away mind you, so I am able to get an underhook, grip his shoulder, get my forearm under his jaw, and with my foot behind his, turn my body and prop him squarely against the wall. He was pinned and confused, and then the bartender came to ""escort"" the gentlemen out of the bar. And that was it. A messy situation was diffused in a matter of seconds.

Too be honest, it happened fast, I was drunk, and details are a bit fuzzy. Not to mention, I might not have gotten involved if I wasn't inebriated, but who doesn't stick up for family? All I do know is that I felt my body respond so naturally to the situation, I was feeling complete control. I knew immediately I was the most dangerous person in that bar, the strongest (although, again, liquid courage).

The best part about it? I did it one-handed. My other hand was carrying my purse and a beer.

Sorry for the rant, yet it's been awhile since that happened and it's never a fun time so figure I'd put out a little PSA. And just because your gi doesn't stink when it dried out after a class doesn't mean that it doesn't need to be washed.

Also, for anyone that has a stinky gi even after washing, try drowning it in distilled white vinegar for a bit and then running it through the wash.

1. The seminar mat space was waaayyyyyy too small. It was like sardines in a can. There was a whole bunch of space surronding the seminar mat space that they could have used to lay down more mats.
2. They should have also improved the seminars by putting up big screen tvs or projectors and having a camera crew film the instructor as he was giving instructions. Instead, all the short people in the back were so out of luck.
3. I was hoping to see more vendors there, where was SYR, Datsusara, and etc...?
4. We were hoping to pick up some gear/dvds on discount from the vendors who were there, but they weren't really discounted.
5. They should have put up more stands for the audience, instead there were A LOT of people who had to stand. Then security made a bunch of people move because they were standing infront of people who were on bleachers.
6. They needed more security on hand, people just ended up jumping the fence because of the BS no standing in front of the bleachers policy. After a couple of matches, people actually ended up ON THE MAT! See the later matches to see what I'm talking about. People who snuck on the mat would stand and further block the ""good"" people who didn't sneak onto the mat.
7. People from the bleacher threw water bottles at the people who snuck on the mats. People in the stand actually ended up BOO-ing because of the people who snuck onto the mat.
8. Unprofessional - You can actually see a little boy running around during the [Cooper vs. Schembri match](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpiVOQUrmUI). It's not too distracting when you watch the video, but when you're live there watching it from that side. The boy was pretty distracting! After awhile we ended up watching the boy and making comments about him than the actual match. LOL.
9. Watching the videos at home on FREE YouTube now is 100x better than watching it there standing. You can make out every single detail. We couldn't even see what happened at the end of the Glover vs. Terra match because the people who snuck on the mats stood up and blocked our way.
10. Main event was a no show!

Overall, the expo was not organized well, lacked some professionalism, and was not worth our time. I would not go to another one for a very long time.

1373991384.0,62,self.bjj,1if61w,Restoring balance: Why too much bjj may not be the most healthy path (thoughts on life).,gunslinger_006,81,19,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1if61w/restoring_balance_why_too_much_bjj_may_not_be_the/,"Warning:  Long read, there is a very short TLDR version at the bottom.

So, I have been training for 18 months now.  My participation has varied from 5-6 days a week to 2 days a week and back again, depending on how much my body can handle, and my life off the mat.

Its fair to say that right from the beginning, I was obsessed with BJJ.  I caught the sickness really bad.  Every waking moment was now dedicated to jiu jitsu.  I was reading blog posts at work only to go train and then get home from the gym to open up my laptop and watch technique and competition videos while taking notes.  I filled three notebooks in three months doing this.

That full time obsession continued for about 16 months until very recently, and I wanted to share my thoughts on balancing BJJ vs other parts of my life.

Just before I found BJJ, I bought my first Harley Davidson.  Its my dream bike.  Flat murder black, no frills, very little chrome.  All business.  Its maybe my 6th motorcycle, but its my favorite by far.  I have been riding for 12 years, on the track and off.  I have slayed the dragon, I have race trained with the California Superbike School, I even went down once but wasn't injured due to wearing a lot of gear and some luck.

But BJJ...it pushed everything else out of my life.  That brand new bike that took third place in a motorcycle show when I first got it...it sat in my garage with a thick layer of dust.

It wasn't the only hobby that got pushed out of my life:  I had no money or time to go shooting (gun enthusiast).  I had no time to play videogames which used to be my go-to stress reliever after a hard day at work.  I had no time to turn a wrench on my motorcycle.

But it was more than that....it wasn't just that I was lacking time for those other things, I was lacking *interest* also.  I simply wasn't interested in hopping on my bike, or taking my AR15 down to the range to blast some paper.  I wasn't interested in the latest game release, and I didn't feel that I needed it anymore to relieve my stress...after all I had rolling for that.

I even talked for a while about selling my motorcycle because I was afraid that I might go down again and ruin my knee or something, and anything that might hinder my progress at BJJ was out of the question.

I did all the normal white belt shit.  I got obsessed with getting my blue belt for a while.  I learned way too many techniques before focusing on my basics (technique collection is good but it can be a distraction from the most important stuff!).

I competed and lost.  I competed and won.  I got a few shiny medals and the door to my spare bedroom (now fully matted and nicknamed ""the danger room"" in an homage to my favorite band of mutants) now clanks when I close it.  I have more Gis than I really should own also, I even gave a few away on here to people who needed them way more than myself.  

I had put all of my proverbial eggs in only ONE basket.

Recently though, I had some kind of mental awakening.  I got promoted to the Advanced class where I'm now getting absolutely murdered by experienced blues, purples, and brown belts.  I am the nail now, but in the fundamentals class I was the hammer most of the time.  I actually like being the nail more than the hammer, but that is a whole other post.

I started to look at these purple belts and get to know them.  They train hard, really really hard and frequently too...but these guys don't just have BJJ in their lives.  They have families and other hobbies too, they don't have just ONE thing going for them.

Something in my brain clicked recently.  I started asking myself if I could maintain the pace I currently have, all the way to purple belt.  I know the answer is ""no, I cannot and I should not"".

I think this idea of BJJ being a marathon, not a sprint...I'm finally understanding that.

I'm back on the bike.  I'm rekindling old friendships that got pushed back when I found BJJ.  I'm planning to go shooting again soon (man ammo is pricey these days).  

Here is the amazing part:  By letting these other interests back into my life...the result has been amazing.  I ENJOY TRAINING MORE.  I enjoy BJJ more.  A bad day on the mat doesn't kill me anymore because I have other things in my life that bring me happiness.

Yeah, I'm training a bit less, but I feel like I'm getting more out of it somehow.  I feel like I've found some magic formula that allows me to train a bit less, but get more out of my mat time and still continue to progress at a nice pace.  I'm also, somehow, rolling much better also.  I'm more relaxed and less focused on some goal.  I think maybe, just maybe I'm starting to understand how to flow.  It feels like a kind of joyful apathy if that makes any sense.  I'm happier to care just a little bit less.

If you are in that stage where BJJ has pushed everything non-BJJ out of your life:  My humble advice is to try and diversify your life a bit.  Rekindle those old relationships.  Get back into an old hobby you used to love before grappling pushed it aside.  Maybe even spend a bit less time on the mats.

I think I have finally found the right balance between dedication and obsession, and it has made every single aspect of my life better.

TLDR:  If BJJ has pushed all of your old hobbies and interests out of your life, consider letting them back in a bit, you just might find that it actually HELPS your BJJ progression to do this.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,white-belt-3,True,t3_1if61w,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1if61w/restoring_balance_why_too_much_bjj_may_not_be_the/,

We are going to remove the self-assignment function for the Black Belt Flair (but only for Black Belt). Every other belt assignment will remain on a ‘per trust’ basis as it always has been. 


From now all Black Belts (new and existing) wanting assignment with a Black Belt flair, need to contact the moderators. From there we will verify your identity with a couple of checks in much the same manner as happens on /r/IAmA 

This way we know you’re legit, yet if you like a lot of us, you surf during work hours and would like just a little bit of privacy that reddit affords all of us, you still have it.  


If you already have a Black Belt flair please contact us for reassignment. Some of you we already know you are who you say you are, and you will be automatically assigned and not notice any change.

They're not high-level, more concepts that it's useful to keep in mind when you're on the mat. 


1. Head up - if you're looking at the floor on a takedown, your head will get driven down and your takedown will get stuffed. 

2. Back straight - For the same reasons as the above. Don't bend at the waist. 

3. Hip forward - For the same reason as the above. If you're sprawling, you want your hips forward and legs back. Bend over them and put your hips back, and you're going to get slammed. 

4. Knees off the ground - Loads of guys assume that after they've shot in then they should finish the shot from their knees. This robs you of power. If you're sprawling you don't want to be on your knees, because you're too light. 

5. Feet on the ground - Seems obvious, but lots of people forget it.

1361080181.0,52,self.bjj,18ohmz,Why you should train no-gi...,TheRumblePak,67,15,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/18ohmz/why_you_should_train_nogi/,"I've been a no-gi promoter at my school for years now. At my blue and purple belt promotions, I ended my speech my imploring more guys to do the no-gi class. I go to a school that's mainly gi. It is theoretically possible for a person to do 43 hours of classes per week, exactly 3 of which is set aside for no-gi. 

Most people at my school don't like no-gi and the class size has decreased over the years since I have joined. Attendance has decreased to the point where the remaining no-gi stalwarts have been relegated to taking their classes on the alternate mats. The new students don't seem to like no-gi and the advanced students have fallen away from it as time has gone by. 

My appeal to BJJ guys is to not neglect no-gi. Now I fully admit to being biased because I prefer it to the gi but I make every effort to do gi classes as well because of that old adage, doing gi makes your no-gi game better (with caveats - you spider guard players don't do so well). People forget though that it also works the other way.

Why you should do no-gi:

1. Your leglock game will improve a lot faster by doing no-gi. One of the reasons why this doesn't translate to the gi game is because you can defend a lot of leg lock attempts by grabbing a collar or sleeve. The other thing? Lower body control is not rewarded is sport BJJ so a lot of guys neglect this even though it can just be as effective as mount or side control. You get 3 points for passing guard and controlling the upper body of your opponent but [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg7G2ZuMUU4) is considered a neutral position in BJJ (or illegal because it's a knee reap).

2. You will be better prepared to handle scrambles. It's not really something you learn in gi classes but if you ever take a wrestling class, scrambling is a big part of the sport. 

3. You actually learn how to use less strength without the gi than with the gi because of the lack of grips. Guys with gorilla grip strength have to learn how to control opponents without sleeves and collars and must focus on hooks and ties. Yes the no-gi game is faster but that doesn't mean it requires more strength, you probably build a lot more strength doing all that pulling of fabric over a year of gi grappling than ten years of no-gi. 

4. ""Everything you can do in no-gi you can do in gi."" That axiom is largely a myth. If this were true we'd see guillotine and d'arce specialists in the gi game as well. It's never a bad thing to learn new approaches to submissions.

1357662748.0,58,self.bjj,166u9h,Tried Bjj out for the first time last night. (slightly embarrassing story),Luizeef,66,8,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/166u9h/tried_bjj_out_for_the_first_time_last_night/,"so last night i walk in and the class is already underway and about 15 minutes in(my first mistake - being late) my brother and I got there at 6:30(the time posted on their website) and it was closed so we left and came back at around 7:15 and they were open...oops. 

so i go in sign the waiver and start class in a t shirt and shorts(dont have a gi).  they are showing the class what drill to run and then tell us to pair off. so i'm paired with this dude and long story short its basically me doing a shit job of remembering the steps in the drill and my partner just sitting there and walking me through the steps. its like i'm a little kid in 1st grade and he is teaching me how to do division or something. 

so i'm doing the steps the best i can(forgetting steps left and right) and everyone else around us is switching back and forth on running the drill. i start to feel like i'm just a burden on my partner because he isnt getting in the training he pays for. he didnt sign up to be an instructor for a day right? he wants to get his chance to practice the moves being shown and he is sitting there getting choked by me over and over again while constantly having to correct my mistakes. dude was super helpful and patient with me but i start to feel like i'm wasting his class time so after the drill is over i tell them i'll come back next week when i have a Gi and money for lessons.

on my way out feeling a little discouraged but not thinking about quitting so quickly. a couple guys in the middle of doing drills see me dressed again and walking out and they yell over to me where are you going? i try and tell them i'll be back next week when i have the money for a gi and all that but they can tell i'm a bit discouraged and probably even expected for this to happen. i dont remember exactly what they said to me but they tell me to not be discouraged and to get my ass back in the changing room and come back.

i'm not going to say the guy's name who really convinced me to get back on the mat but he was a blue belt and just a really helpful dude. when i came back he partnered up with me and walked me through the steps and made me feel a lot more comfortable with the way the first day was going for me. so he walked me through the drills armbars, chokes, sweeps, mount escapes and was patient and helpful as fuck.

after that we had 5 minute sparring sessions and as i expected i'm getting thrown around like a 4 year old.  i feel like i'm 8 years old again and my brother is just manhandling me but its still fun as fuck to roll with people. so i'm getting tapped left and right. the only guy i was able to tap was a yellow belt dude that i'm guessing means he is from the younger class just moving up to the adult classes and i get the feeling that he sort of let me tap him a couple times because other than the 2 times i got him he seemed to be able to control me pretty well even though he is probably 5 years younger than me.

the last roll was with the guy i started with. the guy that i almost walked out on. he didnt roll with me in the last 5 minutes. instead he taught me a couple things like a takedown to side control and how to escape side control if that move is performed on me. 

after everything was done i got the blue belt dude's number so i can call him next time i want o come in and buy my gi. after they let me know that they didnt want me to walk out in the middle of a class because it makes me look like a little bitch and is disrespectful. he tell me this in an angry way either. everything said after class was positive and i cant wait to get back in but i'll have to wait a little while.

one thing i need to do is get stronger now. i swear i rolled with all white belts (except the one yellow) and they were all so damn much stornger than me it was crazy. anyone have good strength training tips for me?

1290461894.0,54,self.bjj,ea5tz,A Quick &amp; Dirty Guide for White Belts,whosthis,59,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/ea5tz/a_quick_dirty_guide_for_white_belts/,"I'm a brown belt and an instructor and today I felt like writing a train of thought piece for people starting BJJ and surviving the first year. I'm going to assume you don't train yet. Let's get started.

You probably like watching MMA and have the idea that training BJJ could be cool. Google BJJ gyms in your area and ask on sites like this for good schools to try out.

Stop making excuses like ""I want to get in shape first."" Nothing gets you ready for BJJ except doing BJJ. (Watching Youtube clips and trying them on your annoyed girlfriend doesn't count.)

Should you do gi or no-gi? This is irrelevant at this point. Find the best gym in your area and do whatever they offer. Eventually you should train whichever one you like more (or the best option, doing both) but don't act like you can't train under a gi-only instructor when your dream is to be a ""em em ay"" fighter.

**Time to take your first class.** Wear shorts with no pockets that tie off with a good draw string and a t-shirt you don't mind getting ruined. You may be given a loaner gi to wear.

Show up a little early to meet the instructor, sign a waiver and check out the space.

When class starts, pay attention, follow instructions and just try to do whatever everyone else is doing.

The class will likely go like this:

1. warm-ups,
2. learn and drill 2-3 techniques (you may get your own special first lesson at this point),
4. live drilling
5. and maybe sparring (not all gyms let people spar day one.)

If you get paired up with someone for drilling, don't worry about ""wasting their time"" because you're a white belt. Everyone has to help everyone and if you're eager to practice and drill, no matter how awful you are, then you aren't wasting their time.

Sparring time. Watching MMA might make you feel like you've got half a clue but there is an ocean of difference between watching and doing.

If you ever saw someone tap to a ""lucky"" choke or armbar in MMA and thought ""Why did he tap!? I wouldn't have tapped!"", now is your time to find out why yes, he really did need to tap to that.

If you ""almost get"" a move on a colored belt, they let you and they are just being nice to the new white belt.

**How to not make enemies on your first day:**

- Don't pick anyone up and slam them.
- Don't try any leglocks you saw on Youtube.
- Don't just crank on necks.
- Try not to spaz too hard.
- Don't brag about anything.

You are allowed to spaz a little because you are a white belt and no one expects any better out of you. But you should work to replace spazzing with real technique as you train more.

This class will be a blur and you will likely forget everything you learned. That's normal. It takes learning and drilling techniques many times over many years to really get them.

You are likely now aware of muscles in your body that you never knew existed before as they scream at you as you roll out of bed the following morning. That means you did it right.

The best way to deal with anxiety, feeling stupid, being out of shape: realize that everyone (except genetic freaks) went through this too and stop worrying about it. You don't know this stuff yet and that's why you are here to learn.

Claustrophobic? Prepare to take confront your fears head on. This fear will go away as you get exposed to it and learn what to do.

If you smoke, quit now. It's bad for you, it's bad for your BJJ and you smell awful to your training partners who can't avoid breathing in your musk.

**Finishing your first month.** Most people don't even take a second class, so you're doing better than most people. But most people also don't finish 6 months to a year, so you're not better than them by much.

Time to get into a rhythm. Keep coming to classes, be eager to learn and drill and don't be afraid of asking questions.

How many times a week should you train? Work up to at least 3 times per week as soon as your body can handle it. Here's a rough guide to classes per week:

1: You will be a white belt forever and barely learn anything.
2: This will barely maintain your skill level and progress slowly.
3: You will make headway and still have recovery days.
4: Now you're getting serious. You are becoming a fixture in the gym.
5: You will see big improvements but get more injuries.
6: You probably don't have a job.
7+: You probably don't have a job or girlfriend. But your BJJ is going great!

**Finishing the first 6 months.** Your body is probably getting into much better shape than when you started. You should take a look at your diet and sleep habits and try to improve them. This is good for you, good for your BJJ and will even help prevent injuries.

**Ready for your first tournament?** Of course not. But do one anyway. Everyone should try it at least once. You will probably be very nervous. That is normal. The only way to overcome this anxiety is to compete so much you get over it. Unfortunately that's not a possible solution for your first competition.

Competing as a white belt is good too because the pressure to perform and ""prove your belt"" is much worse once your belt has a color. No one expects anything impressive out of a white belt so you are free suck and no one will hold it against you (except Youtube comments on your tournament video.)

I would tell you to not worry too much about your blue belt and you will likely say you don't really care about your belt. But I also know you're probably secretly coveting it anyway.

**What you should be working on as a white belt:**

- Regular attendance. This is the most important skill you can have because I could leave the rest of this list empty and you'd still get better by going to the gym.
- Getting in shape. You need to be able to handle a whole class from start to finish and never quit sparring because you're tired.
- Remembering techniques. Drill a lot and maybe keep a written journal.
- Defense and escapes. As a beginner you will spend most of your time in bad spots so naturally this is the main area to improve your technical performance.

Keep that up and you'll get better and eventually earn your blue belt.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,True,,,True,t3_ea5tz,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/ea5tz/a_quick_dirty_guide_for_white_belts/,

Key points:

1. You will not represent any team but the original school you train at. This is for everyone of all teams. No politics or loyalty issues here.  No such thing as creonte or the likes.

2. This is a supplemental gym for you to train at during hours that you can't normally train at your own academy. People from all over will be coming of all levels during all different times of the day during the week.

3. If you qualify, you can get key access. Meaning you can open the gym and have access to it as much as you want 24/7. There will be security cameras to be sure everyone is being safe and not negligent. There will be more on liability and precautions, etc...

4. Many people charge $20+ for a mat fee for one day. This will be $30 for a mat fee for one month.

5. You will be apart of a private FB group where people will announce group training times and if you are a key holder then you can organize times yourself as well at any time for the most part.

6. There may be possibilities to have access to some of the workout equipment and that would give a chance to also create group workout sessions as well. (Kettlebells, battling ropes, pull up cages, etc...)

More ideas to come...sound interesting to you? Please note in the comments if you are interested and you live in NJ or in proximity to Red Bank NJ...remember this is will NOT be a structured school and is only meant to help people train more or train for those who have no income to train. Will work on how we can make it easier for pure beginners. This is ideal for those training 6 months or more right now.

That being said, I was relieved when the gym owner turned him down. Hear me out...

I don't know if it's just my gym, but blood/broken skin is a common occurrence on the mat. Very common. I am not well educated on the details of HIV/AIDS transmission, but I would honestly be concerned/afraid to roll at a gym with this scenario.

Now here's the thing, when the gym owner refused to sign the guy, he got angry, REAL angry. There was a heated argument. I feel for the guy, he's got enough to deal with as it stands. But you can't argue your way into an MMA gym with a blood-borne disease when the environment has a frequent occurrence of broken skin, etc...

I've been training at BJJ for two years (before even meeting her) and I go mostly on the week-ends, but also some evenings during the week. Recently she complained that I spent no time with her and way too much time on BJJ. I spend maybe 10 hours a week doing BJJ.

She's been more and more irritable, and when I told her I would train twice as much for the coming weeks (abu dhabi trials) she got really mad. I train really really hard for the trials, and it just makes her angry. I tell her it's temporary, that it's a huge competition and all, but it doesn't matter.

She's not interested in the sports, she's mad that I come home injured (sometimes) and she's angry that I roll with other girls. Like, she came to spectate me once and saw me rolling with this very attractive woman (nothing between her and me, of course) and she got really, really mad after.

Yesterday, she gave me an ultimatum: ""It's BJJ or it's me."" I don't want to quit BJJ. No way. But I fear she is serious and will leave me if I don't stop BJJ completely.

This past weekend, my instructor was assaulted with a baseball bat while bouncing at a club. He was distracted by someone else while the attacker came up from behind and hit him on the side of his skull. He's in stable condition at the hospital and can move his hands and feet and respond back with yes and no. While he can do that, he might have severe memory loss. He is paralyzed on the right side of his face also. We're not sure if he'll remember any Jiu Jitsu, but we'll find out soon enough. The man who did it is in police custody now.

My instructor is a Carlson Gracie Jr. brown belt and one of the nicest guys I've ever known and now he might not even be able to do BJJ ever again. One of our purple belts who was a life long friend of his will be taking over for now.

I guess the reason I'm writing this is to help comprehend what is going on since it all seems so surreal. It's just crazy to think that he might not even remember some of us who he's trained up from lowly white belts. Remember today at practice to go and thank your instructor for what he does. Hell, give him a hug if you can because there's no guarantee that he'll be there tomorrow.

Thanks
tl;dr: Instructor assaulted by baseball bat, might not know jiu jitsu, go hug your instructor

EDIT: If anyone happens to train with Carlson Jr. we've tried to get a hold of him but have been unsuccessful. If you train with him pm me so we can work something out.

EDIT 2: One commenter suggested setting up a charity fund in his name. I talked with another teammate who can help me out and we're going to get started on one this weekend. My dad will also be helping me. I will keep r/bjj posted on that.

1372105895.0,50,self.bjj,1gzpcf,Things that big guys &amp; women in BJJ have in common...,Rich959,61,11,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1gzpcf/things_that_big_guys_women_in_bjj_have_in_common/,"The other day I was reading some older posts on a female BJJer's blog &amp; it occured to me that, for polar opposites within the spectrum of BJJ practitioners, very big guys &amp; women share some common ground when it comes to BJJ training.  For example:

1)  Not getting to train with physically similar partners very often.

Women &amp; big guys both usually have to work around not really getting much opportunity to work on their technique in a ""fair"" matchup.  For women, things would be much easier if they could try new techniques against another woman of similar weight, instead of always dealing with the uphill battle of a significant size &amp; strength disadvantage.  Big guys have the opposite problem, as they usually have unfair advantage they can't completely turn off, which makes it harder to be certain a technique is solid &amp; would work in the absence of a weight advantage.  

As a result, women &amp; big guys experience similar excitement when they FINALLY see another woman/big guy walk in to sign up for classes, which is followed by similar dissapointment when that person only comes to a few classes before quitting :/

2)  Having to take backhanded post-tap compliments with a smile

""You're really good, for a girl."" / ""I didn't expect you to be so good.""

""You're too strong for me.""  / ""You're smart with how you use your weight advantage.""

3)  Lots of trial &amp; error for a GI that fits

If you're guy that weighs 165 &amp; needs a GI, the World is your oyster.  Pick literally any GI brand &amp; style you like, because there's no question it'll be available in your size &amp; should fit just fine.  Woman or 260+ Male?  Your options just got cut down to 1/4 of the market.  You'll also find that sizing charts are an art more than a science and should consider yourself lucky if it only takes you 2 GIs to find one that fits you really well.

4) Advance beyond a certain level, and you're essentially a unicorn.

Guys over a certain size &amp; women are already rare to begin with in BJJ [women moreso], so the fact that only a small percent of all BJJ trainees advance to blue belt &amp; beyond makes big guys &amp; women above a certain level of skill extra rare.  As a result, you'll often have someone tell you that you're the 'best' big guy/woman they've ever rolled with, often while seeming somewhat shocked you exist in the first place.  It sound nice at first, until it occurs to you that your goal is to be considered 'good' based on the same standards as everyone else.  



Now, those similarities aside, there are obviously TONS of areas where a very big guy's experiences in BJJ will be much different from a female's.  I just found it surprising how much I could relate to some of the experiences posted by female BJJers, despite having so little in common on the surface.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,1372106082.0,,purple-belt,True,t3_1gzpcf,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1gzpcf/things_that_big_guys_women_in_bjj_have_in_common/,

At the end of class my professor congratulated me (he had been watching) and told me to purchase my blue belt.

I would have never thought when i first posted on this sub-reddit three months ago a few minutes before i went into my first class that my life would change the way it has. 

Since my first initial post, i have lost 32 pounds, competed 2 times. 1 at the Pan Ams with only 2 months training, and again this past weekend at the Copa Pacifica here in SoCal. I train 6 days out of the week and today during class i was finally awarded my first stripe. Its a small accomplishment to most but a huge step for me as my life prior to BJJ was not in a good place. I want to thank this /r/bjj for being helpful with any questions i have and we are like a big BJJ family here. We help each other out, from the lonely starting white belt like myself, to the season Black belts. We all look out for each other and thats something a lot of other sub-reddits lack.

1350342225.0,47,self.bjj,11jdi3,Regarding the removal of Metamoris video links,UncleSkippy,57,10,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/11jdi3/regarding_the_removal_of_metamoris_video_links/,"All,

As you've probably noticed by now (if you visited /r/bjj this morning and then recently), the mods have removed the links to the Metamoris videos. 

Why?

Well, the concept of PPV events for BJJ is a relatively new thing. As a result, we haven't established a policy regarding the posting of paid-for streams/videos. As the sport grows, there will (*hopefully*) be more events like this and the need for a policy will increase.

So, we have started to put together ideas. I have sent an email to Metamoris and Ralek asking about their policy regarding the reposting of their PPV videos. Seeing as the videos are still available on-demand at the Metamoris site, my gut tells me that they would prefer the video links be removed for the time being (or maybe just permanently). I'll wait and see though. Just trying to be thorough.

On one hand, I'm sure everybody wants to encourage more events like Metamoris. The posting of videos that can still be bought on-demand from the Metamoris site tends to dissuade people from buying them which takes away from the incentive to put on these events in the first place. 

On the other hand, we realize that reddit is global and that copyright laws are bound to country borders. Why should the links be removed if it is illegal in 3-4 countries but legal in hundreds of others? 

The mods have always been **very** hands off when it comes to moderation in this subreddit. There are very few instances where intervention was needed; the moderation log sometimes sits static for weeks at a time. 

So for now we are going to see what Metamoris says regarding the reposting of the videos. Maybe they will eventually make the streams free after a set period of time (that would be excellent marketing for the next one) or maybe they will simply serve DMCA notices and not respond. We don't know, but we are giving them the opportunity to respond. 

All I know is that the event as a whole was just awesome. Replays are still available on the Metamoris web site.

Training start date: February 1, 2012

Promoting Professor/Instructor: Bruno Tostes

Compete or plan to compete: I competed Twice this year at local NAGA Tournaments Placing 2nd in gi at 190 and placed thrid in both gi and no gi at 185 in september. Hopefully I will be competing more this year. I'm shooting for 4 tournaments

Biggest success on the mat: Not spazzing out when a higher belt gets on top of me and still trying to work my game even if it mean constantly re-establishing guard and starting over

Largest area of improvement: Probably My sweeps, and definitely my patience

Most successful technique you catch on others: Bow and arrow from modified mount

Submission or sweep you always get caught in: Back Chokes just about any of them but im getting better at defending

It doesn't have to be about technique, in fact, I'm guessing most won't even be about technique. It just has to do with a moment when you learned something from, or through jiujitsu.

For me, one moment was when I ws first starting and I was using a lot of energy and power to try to escape or try to get into positions.  I'm a roosterweight guy, so sub 130. I'm in pretty decent shape, but i would still get so gassed, and I would get in three - 4 or 5 minute rolls and I would be totally wasted, missing out on 2 or 3 rolls a class.  One day I was watching some BJJ video, it could have been ""ask a black belt,"" where one of the black belts was relaying a story about how his professor, Ralph Gracie, was telling him 'you should train more,' so he started to go to the gym 5 days a week, and then Ralph said again 'you should train more,' so then he did 7 days, and then his Ralph continued to say 'you should train more.'

It wasn't until later on that he realized that he was sitting out a lot, especially when he got tired, and he didn't want to roll and get beat because he was tired.  This guy realized that his professor was telling him to train more when he was tired, not to sit out just because he was tired, just because he was afraid of losing and looking bad, or feeling bad.

It was then that I asked myself whether I was sitting out because I was literally too tired to move, or if it was because I didn't want to look bad, and if was because of the latter, it wasn't a good enough reason.  That lesson, about ego, has stayed with me since, and I think about it a lot.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,blue-belt,True,t3_1at2dn,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1at2dn/what_are_your_bjj_epiphanies_not_just_techniques/,

One concern I have with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is that the schools upon which I have visited and watched often have classes with both the men and the women.

f I start training, I am worried I will offend women if I say I will not train with them. How can I politely tell them that I cannot/will not roll or train with them? I also would prefer to not speak with them, but this is not a must. Thank you, friends.

EDIT TIMESTAMP 13:55 EST: I am most grateful to hear all your commentary and thoughts. Thank you all. I fear, though, from some of the responses, that my inquiries will not be favored at many Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gymnasiums/schools. This is deeply disheartens me because I was hoping to engage in a martial art and become a martial art practitioner. 

Some of these responses have poked fun at me and my beliefs and some have been mean and hurtful. Why must people be this way? When I immigrated to America, I was told that there would be great acceptance compared to where I went to Uni in England. In England, I felt very hurt day by day when the other students would throw bacon at me or say terrible things. Sometimes, I feel that this acceptance is there and sometimes it is not. 

I never said that I disrespect women. **When I married my wife, it is my sect's custom, as a sign of respect to my wife, to not touch other women after marriage. Is this so wrong according to you and your culture?** I have highest respect for women. I have my wife and my almost one year old daughter and four year old son. Do you think I respect my son more than my daughter? Or more than my wife? Maybe you think I would trade my wife for two goats? Or my daughter for 7 mules? Your views of my culture are just not fair. 

It is hard enough to maintain our traditional customs without being made fun of or told terrible things. I watch martial arts and MMA because it is very interesting and I wish to learn more. I also viewed it as a method to engage myself more in Western culture. It makes me sad to think I will be unable to do this. To say that I am a bad person that is part of a bad religion is not fair.

To those of you that support me in my Quest, I have greatest thanks directed towards you and hope I meet more people like you in my Life. Please procreate and bring more offspring like yourself.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,1363630782.0,,,True,t3_1aiu6t,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1aiu6t/how_do_i_politely_decline_training_with_women/,

I think the strength of BJJ is the ability to spar.

Two questions:

1. what are the chances one of you trains with a world champ? (specifically a gi or no-gi mundials champ)
2. what are the chances they would be available to answer some questions for us?

She took 2nd overall in her weight class  and I couldn't be more proud of her. But my concern is this-  the boy she was fighting- she was ahead on points big time.  12-2 witch is remarkable because the boy she was fighting was more advanced than her- going for advanced triangles,  anyways 10 seconds before time is called as I'm trying to coach her into staying calm and holding on to keep from tapping. this kids dad screams at his son to BREAK my daughters arm. at 9 years old...  when his kid was loosing badly.  so 4 seconds to go my girl taps :( and he hurt her pretty bad. everyone started booing the poor kid for doing what he was told.  and my daughter pretty much got a standing ovation.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  Also I saw kids fighting way below what they should be in belt level, like yellow belts fighting as whites.  is this a common thing? And any advice on how to handle it would be great  thanks for checking this out.
I was filming it, but was focusing on her a lot so I missed a few pieces with the camera  I'll try to get a youtube link.

However, he finally caved and created a Facebook page where he now posts daily ""Angry Professor"" rants to which I'll post here.  Feel free to add in your own commandments as well.
  
Here are some excerpts:     

*   What makes professor angry... People who learn bjj through osmosis. You come in roll around and when it's time for class where are you at? Your on the bench watching. That is definitely going to make your game a lot better. Where are my blue belts at?  
*  What makes professor angry...""I have kind of lost my motivation to train since I've found women and booze"" - blue belt quote.
I was so angry my head almost exploded when I heard this   
*  What makes professor angry...
Impromptu white belt seminars in the middle of class. I have long been a member of the club ""black belts against white belts teaching other white belts"" formed by my longtime friend Dan . The blind can't lead the blind  
*  What makes professor angry...
People who do not pay attention during the technique portion of class and then want to consume all of my time while drilling. Please pay attention and ask questions. I show the move and explain at least 5 times. If you are standing behind me move to a position you can see. The last time I checked I wasn't made of glass and you do not have X-ray vision.  
*  What makes professor angry...
When I tell someone to tap and they give the "" I'm good man it only hurts a little"" and snap. Now you're out for at least 8 weeks bravo tough guy it's training not the worlds.  
*  What makes professor angry?...
When people do the same thing wrong repeatedly expecting a different result . There are bjj commandments carved in stone that we all must follow. Example ""Thou shalt not hangout in someone's spider guard"". If you choose to hangout and continue getting triangled ,swept, etc please refer back to this commandment.  
  
03/26/13 Post:  

*    Bjj commandment of the day..
""Thou shall not crab fight""
If you are not familiar with this term it refers to two people generally not in good position trying to foot lock one another. Crab fighting is usually a white belt maneuver where one person tries to foot lock the person who is foot locking them. Please let go of the foot and get out, you are not in a position of leverage.

All of us have times when we feel like we suck at BJJ, and some of us seek advice and reassurance here. I've done exactly that before. There's nothing wrong with it; sometimes, a stranger telling you to keep going is just what you need. 

But when we talk about the ups and downs of training, we often forget to discuss the ups. I want to present a more balanced picture of the BJJ experience by discussing the times when everything goes right and your progress is so tangible, you could armbar it. 

Tonight, I had such a rare night. We drilled double-leg takedowns, which I was thrilled about because mine need work. Afterwards, we had five or six rounds of sparring in a row. I'm easily the smallest guy in my gym, and the only person my size (a girl) wasn't feeling well enough to roll, so I went up against several much bigger people, as usual. But I didn't do half-bad. I did a good job of retaining guard, launching attacks, and escaping back to guard or half-guard when those things failed. 

My crowning achievement of the night (and my BJJ career so far) came when I triangled a blue belt who outweighs me by 60-70 pounds. Now, I'm not trying to say I've gotten better than him, and I definitely don't plan to brag about it. He made a split-second mistake, and I capitalized on it. It doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things. But the fact that I was able to capitalize at all shows that I've been improving, even when it feels like I'm at a standstill. I was so elated at my progress, I didn't even care when he triangled me right back about thirty seconds later. 

So that's me. If you've been feeling good about training recently, or you remember a prominent time when you did, feel free to share! Let's bring some optimism to the subreddit. ",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,blue-belt,True,t3_16sr98,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/16sr98/i_feel_like_a_beast/,

Inspired by the other thread, I have an Ezekiel Kimonos gi that I bought very lightly used for super cheap (maybe rolled in twice?) and then I de-patched it completely...but then I never got around to re-patching it.

The Gi top is an A3 but its been heavily shrunk so its basically an A2L.

The pants are an A2 and roomy (they fit me and I'm 5'10"" 199lbs).

Here is the deal:  I want this to go to someone who NEEDS it, not just someone who wants a free gi.  If you are training on an extremely tight budget and need a new Gi, but cannot afford one, please post up and tell me about your situation (or send me a PM if you prefer more privacy).  I will wait for a few people to post and then choose the person that I feel will benefit the most from this.  I'll ship it for free in the US too.

(Gi is white with black contrast stitching, pants are the same, both look/feel/smell new)

Self post, no karma.  :-)

**UPDATE 1:**  Wow I have gotten way more messages than I was expecting.  I will make a decision on Sunday (tomorrow) and update this thread with pics of the gi and the username of the person I selected.  If they want to share their story at that point, they are welcome to (but out of respect for their privacy, I should not share it for them). 

**A thought:  We maybe should consider doing this more often, for those of you who maybe own a gi that you hardly ever use (maybe the fit is off, maybe you just never really liked it).  It seems there are a LOT of guys and gals struggling financially with trying to train in the Gi.  I have heard a lot of people say ""I've been training no-gi because I cannot afford a gi right now"".**

**If we as a community can figure out how to make unused Gis get to people who cannot really train without that help, we could really do a lot of good.**

Here is a pic of the Gi in question:

For fun, here is a pic of me with my Professor(s):

**UPDATE 2:  I have selected a recipient for the Gi.  Two actually.**

First, a note about this process:  I am amazed.  This was much harder than I expected.   I received 10 requests and stories.  I wish I could help all 10 people.  I really do.  I feel like if I had the money (I don't) I would go out and buy a basic FUJI for every one of these people, as every story really tugged at my emotions.  

Some people train no-gi and want to train in the Gi.

Some already have a Gi that isn't right for them, and are looking to find one that is.

Some are ex military and really struggling to get things together post service.

Some are just really hurting for money, whether they are students or simply trying to get by on a minimum wage situation.

This decision is very hard because I know that no matter how I choose, there will be 9 people who I will not be able to help here, and I feel for them in a real way.

After reading everyone posts and messages about 10 times, I finally had to ask myself who I feel would get the most out of this, but also who may have the most potential to stick with BJJ and have it transform their lives.  I was hoping to find someone who already trains, but needs a Gi to continue their training and get to that next level.

**Surprise:  I actually have two gis that I can part with.  The Ezekiel Kimonos gi that I posted a picture of, and another Killer Bee Gi that I was loaning to my friend but he stopped training and its been sitting.  I was going to keep it as a backup, but fuck that, it will do much more good for someone else who needs it (and I have like 6 gis already).**

A pic of both Gis together, ready to be shipped out to new homes:  http://i.imgur.com/aep8iep.jpg

**Recipient 1**:  SeanC3

Ultimately, the person I selected is an 8 year military veteran named Sean.  He just got out of the service and wants to train, but is stuck without a Gi until the fall at the earliest.  He is 27 years old and on unemployment as he searches for a job.  He also promised in his message that once he gets on his feet, he will pay it forward by gifting another Gi to someone else.  He is meeting with local professors currently, trying to find a place to train and the Gi was a big sticking point in his finances.

**Recipient 2**:  wascawee_wabbit

A cook at a hotel who already trains 4-5 days a week no-gi, but desperately wants a gi to roll in so he can stay for the gi open mat.  This guy just seemed super sincere, and even offered to send me photos of his paycheck to prove he is really broke.  This guy has been saving his pennies to try and buy a basic Fuji, but I'm going to send him this Killer Bee Gi (its going to be big on you bro, shrink it up in the dryer!) so he can start training in the Gi asap.

I will contact these two guys today and ship this stuff out tomorrow morning.

I will ask these guys to come in here and simply let us know that the Gi arrived.

I hope that if any of you out there own a Gi you don't really love, you will consider sending it to someone who can't train without it.

BJJ has changed my life and if I can help open that door for someone else, its worth it.

UPDATE 3:  I just shipped out both Gis today, I will be sending the tracking numbers to the recipients via PM.

1363955137.0,42,self.bjj,1asmwk,Losing respect for my team and coach‏,bjj_throwaway_,52,10,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1asmwk/losing_respect_for_my_team_and_coach/,"Hey redditors,
I was hoping I could get some opinions as to what I should do/how to act.

Background info: I've been studying bjj for about four years. 100% dedicated both on and off the mats. Became a blue in about 1.5 years. I come from a very small school. When I first started, there were 6 of us fully dedicated. Now, there's about 18 people (on a good night) ranging from white to browns. 

It is an all male bjj class so very immature jokes are made constantly. At first I was fine with this and would also make tons of jokes myself, but now it seems like the classes have turned more into a hangout and less about bjj. On some days, we'd start an hour late and would just jump into rolling, with no warmups or drilling. We'd pretty much sit around making inappropriate jokes. During one practice, two of my teammates (higher belts) held down another individual to take his rashguard off. Needless to say, he stopped showing up to class.

Because we're so relaxed, some of the new white belts will flat out disrespect. I'm the smallest one in the group (125lb with the next closest opponent being 175lbs). We've had new wrestlers (white belts) come in who straight up say they will not roll with me. Some of these guys are collegiate wrestlers, so occasionally, my sensei will have them teach a class. I'm fine with learning from whites, but I really don't respect some of these guys. The way they conduct themselves on and off the mats. I'll be honest that I am a bit jealous that the whites get to teach some classes seeing how we don't have too many high ranking belts, but I'm still willing (begrudgingly) to learn from those who know more than me.

Due to the small enrollment, the moves we learn are pretty basic for the most part (I'm not complaining since basics are the foundation blocks), but when we do learn more advanced moves, the whites don't really understand the risk involved. I've had whites attempt to crank on heel hooks on me on multiple occasions. 

We recently started sharing mat space with a yoga group and I noticed my sensei (a single man practicing bjj for about 8 years) would often stop mid roll so that he can watch the females in the yoga classes. Sometimes during a roll, he'll re-position himself so that he can face them. Then he'll make sexual jokes to the group. When the girls walk buy, the alpha males in my group start to puff up their chests. I'm a male myself and I understand these urges. But I'm also a paying member too.

I've begun to try to lead by example and just focused on training and keeping my mouth shut, but I started to get shunned and started to be called a downer.

So what can I do from here? I consider these guys my brothers. I do a lot for my school and when I'm not there, people tell me that it's just not the same. I look after these guys and followup on their injuries to make sure they're alright. Some of them are really good and dominate in competitions and whenever we cross train at other schools. I've voiced my opinions, but they go unheard. When can I say enough is enough? And should I just move on?

Every thread posted like this, the top comments all say the same thing for a very good reason.  Real medical doctors can't diagnose you with just a random picture or vague description, random people on the internet who also happen to train are going to be even less helpful.  The only way to figure out what is wrong is to talk to someone with actual medical training.

I'm not saying this to be a jerk, but if you really enjoy training you need to take care of yourself and random internet advice is not comparable to a doctor when you can't raise your arm above your shoulder because you landed funny.  The longer you wait to get injuries looked at, the more likely they are to get worse or cause permanent issues.

If you don't have insurance, check out the urgent care clinics in your area and see if they can help you.  Either way, that torn ACL isn't going to get cheaper to repair because you waited, and smoking weed does not cure and repair everything.

It's up to you, but if you really love training and want to do this the rest of your life, you have to take care of your body.

I spoke up a little but not forcefully and he kind of laughed it off. This senior student has a violent criminal history which makes me afraid to speak to my instructor about what happened because there weren't many people there so it would be easy to find out who told on him.

This has been a fantastic community in the time I've been here, and I wanted to share with you an experience from this past weekend.

My head instructor got his black belt from Royce Gracie, and I believe trained with him for quite a while.  As such, he comes up from time to time to teach in the area.  This was the first time I got to participate in one of the sessions, since I haven't been training long.  I've never been much of a star-struck guy, and wasn't sure what to really expect.

I was sure that the big dogs in BJJ would be going on tour selling videos, merchandise, giving big talks... no.  Not at all.  This class was just like any other class, except that every few minutes, Royce Gracie would walk around and show you how to improve your technique with your partner.  What's more, the lessons we learned were almost exactly *word for word* what we had been taught in the past from our instructor.  That's not to say that another pair of eyes (Royce Gracie's!) didn't provide some insight - I got plenty of great advice from him.  At the end there were some rolling sessions, and several members got promoted to blues and purples.  I've never seen a belt promotion before, and never imagined seeing one would be this inspiring.  I'm glad my first one was Royce basically saying ""Hey you, come here - you're a purple belt.""  There was really something special about it.


What do I take from this?  Well first of all, this isn't a sport of magic elixirs, snake-oil, and black-belt-only techniques.  These techniques are taught because these techniques work.  It would have been really easy for a Gracie to travel around and peddle some sort of Acai-potion, or promote a special training regimen that ""all the black belts use.""  He could have refused to work with anyone but the most advanced students - after all, we white-belts can learn the basics from our instructor, who evidently knows all of Royce's lessons word for word, and it can be difficult to fit 60 people into a small gym to train.  But this isn't in the nature of jiu-jitsu.  Everyone is there to help everyone improve, succeed, and survive.

Overall I think I came away with lots of technical knowledge, a ton of inspiration, and a respect for jiu-jitsu that surpasses what I had before.  Thanks for reading, now go train.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,white-belt,True,t3_18fj11,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/18fj11/visit_from_royce_reflections/,

After finishing up though, who do i look over to see? None other then Cicero Costha and Luiza Montiero. They had 3 of their purple belts with them. Since Worlds are this week, they needed to find a place to practice. My professor is Brazilian and has lots of friends that always come to visit, so he offered them to come train with us. I rolled with one of the purples and he was just on a different level. Luiza rolled with one of the girls we have the will be competeting at the Worlds, and Cicero rolled with whoever wanted to. The browns and Blacks took first crack and then a few of the purples. The guy is extremely humble, after a roll with one of the purples. He pulled him aside and gathered a group of us to show us a variation to the technique the purple had tried to use. A double underhook pass. 

Tonight we will have the same group come in, and we also have another very well known instructor who will be teaching the class tonight. Eduardo ""Portugues"" Santoro.

In case other people might find it useful, I am sharing it here.",kloverr,44,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1eiyam/i_created_an_excel_worksheet_to_track_my_bjj/,"Here is what it can do:

1. On the [""Main"" page](http://imgur.com/WseRzcW.png) you give the date, the amount of mat time, and a general description of what you went over. It automatically looks up whether you have more specific notes taken on the Notes page. It also automatically keeps track of total hours in class, rolling, and at open mat since you started your record keeping.
2. On the [""Notes"" page](http://imgur.com/BJ6Mu3S.png) you provide more detailed notes if you want to. If you classify the note by starting position and move type, it will allow you to use the Technique Lookup page.
3. The [""Technique Lookup"" page](http://imgur.com/SYdIqQY.png) allows you to filter through all of your notes. E.g. you can filter by submissions from side mount top.
4. The [""Calendar"" page](http://imgur.com/IrBDxye.png) shows a calendar of all of the days you had any mat time. It also shows how many hours you spent in class, rolling, and at open mat, respectively. All of this is automatically generated based on your entries to the Main page.
5. The [""Mat Time"" page](http://imgur.com/CNF6tlx.png) shows a graph of your mat time and some summary stats about your number of hours per week.

If this might be helpful for you, you can download it here: ~~[Link](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=1EA94287C0D550BE!107&amp;authkey=!AEEdqjC4EETezZ8)~~. [Link to the zipped version just in case](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=1EA94287C0D550BE!112&amp;authkey=!AGDkPACKNlChjOw). [edit: It looks like SkyDrive may be messing up the first link. Try the zipped version.]

Usage notes:

1. You should only have to enter data to the Main and Notes pages. Everything else updates automatically. If you do make changes elsewhere, be aware you could break the functionality of the worksheet.
2. For the Technique Lookup page to work, you have to spell everything correctly and have the same capitalization as on the the Tech. Lookup Calcs page.
3. There is a good chance that you will dislike my categorization scheme that the Technique Lookup page uses. For example, ""open guard bottom"" will not be specific enough if you need to differentiate between DLR, spider guard, etc. You can change it, but it will take several steps: a. Go to the ""Tech. Lookup Calcs"" page. Change the starting position and move type lists to whatever you want. b. Make sure the numbers on the left side of the list extend all the way to the last list entry. c. The table in the upper right has two formulas that will need to be changed. The default Position Text formula is VLOOKUP(J2,A2:B25,2) and the default Type Text formula is VLOOKUP(K2,D2:E8,2). B25 and E8 are the end positions of the original two lists - change those values appropriately. E.g. If you add two elements to the position list the Position Text formula changes to VLOOKUP(J2,A2:B27,2). d. Go to the Tech. Lookup page. Right click the starting position button and click ""Format Control."" Change the input range to include the whole list of starting positions. E.g. If you add two new positions, then it changes from 'Tech. Lookup Calcs'!$B$2:$B$25 to 'Tech. Lookup Calcs'!$B$2:$B$27. Do the same thing for the move type button, so that the input range covers the whole list of move types on the other page.
4. The ""Calendar"" page automatically starts on the week of your first entry and marches forward with no breaks. If you want to change that for some reason, you can. Go to the page and unhide columns B through K (select columns A and L, right click, select unhide). The entry in B2 is the first day that will be included - change it however you want. If you want to skip a large chunk of time, go to the box of the Sunday of the first week you want to skip and enter the date of the Sunday of the first week you want to include after the break. E.g. If you were injured 2/4/2013 to 4/24/2013, you can go to 2/10/2013 and enter 4/21/2013 to not display the 2+ month break.",,False,self,t5_2qn02,1369000078.0,,white-belt-1,True,t3_1eiyam,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/1eiyam/i_created_an_excel_worksheet_to_track_my_bjj/,

As everyone who's read his recent open letter will know, Ryan himself would tell you not to sing his praises on the basis of how he acts in seminars and DVDs. 

*However*, at the very least, he is a total BJJ badass, who tries to articulate things that have taken him years of dedicated practise to learn or discover for a wider audience, and I respect that. So I'll start, with a couple of obscure Hall-related things you might not have seen: 

Ryan's UK seminar: he hasn't put out a guard-passing DVD yet (I hope he will) but this has some great concepts in it:

I don't have a clear path on what am I supposed to be working on.  I expect that like always mat time will be the determining factor but I'd like to hear what other higher belts think about the transition.

Here are the options that I've been pondering:

* Improve the basics that I don't use much and therefore aren't high level like guillotine, kimura, hip bump sweep, N/S choke. The goal being to have no holes in my basic game.

* Acquire proficiency in leg attacks and defense so that I'm ready for the toe holds and knee bars at brown.
 
* Acquire proficiency with the 'advanced' positions/submissions I've been postponing: 50/50, berimbolo, inverted positions, darce chokes, etc.  The goal being familiarity will all bjj positions.
 
* Work on chaining all attacks to a deeper level (3-4 rather 2-3).  Allow my training partners to escape the first submissions/sweeps in order to improve the quality of the subsequent attacks.  The goal being to improve my timing and develop a more complex game.
 
* I can also restrict myself when rolling by going for a specific goal (only arm bars from the mount, only wrist locks, etc).
 
Any thoughts?  I've only been purple for a couple months so I'm sure things will become more clear with time but I don't see the 'essence' of what makes a brown belt.  Any links on the matter are also appreciated (I've read Roy Harris article and it was quite informative).

A bit nervous, ill update after the class. Thanks r/BJJ for finally giving me enough motivation to take the plunge.

Edit: not dead. Lol. Just got out. On my way home will write a full write up of my experience once I get home and showered.  

EDIT 2: Full write up. 

OK guys so im showered and my GI is in the washer. Priorities right? So this is my first foray into a real BJJ gym. I had previously taken a BJJ class at a Community College about 3 years ago, but had to quit after 2 classes. Personal Issues. Thus why i have a GI.

A little background about me. Im a big guy in general, and thats really an understatement. To put it in BJJ terms, im 5'8 and wear a A7 GI. Yeah i know. I struggle with depression and anxiety, which played a big role in procrastinating my decision to start. If you know someone or have ever gone through depression, you know how hard it is to stay motivated and get yourself going. Finally after reading this subreddit and seeing myself spiraling out of control weight wise again, i had enough. I had lost 60 pound from Feb 2011 to May 2012, but i started a desk job in July and had gained 30 of it back and just didnt want to fail again. 

So I get to the gym, and im lucky that my cousin in-law is a student there (2 Stripe Blue belt) and had always pushed me to at least try the free class. It eased my nerves a bit that he would be there, but low and behold as im getting there he tells me hes running late and to just go in and introduce myself. This brought back my nerves a bit and thats when i made the initial post, literally as i was getting out of my car. I head in and introduce myself to the professor/master?, im still not sure what to call him. He is very polite and introduces me to some of the other guys, and some of the higher belts come by and introduce themselves to me. I felt right at home, right from the get go. The nerves eased up a bit as to say hey its not so bad after all.

We start warm ups with laps around the mat, now if this was back in May of 2012 i would have been able to probably last a lot longer. Alas though this is January 2013 and man am i OUT OF SHAPE. We do i dunno how many laps and then line up and start doing sprints from one end to the other. I had a chance to catch my breath a bit while i was waiting in line for my turn. After sprints we did some squat jumps, Master Freddy saw that i was struggling catching my breath and told me not to worry about it and to take a quick breather to regain myself. After the Students finished with the back rolls he had us circle around as he showed us the technique we would be learning today. We drilled the technique and then moved on to a live drill of on person starting on their back while the other person is standing. The standing person tries to pass into side control while the person on their back tries to prevent it. My Cousin partnered with me and showed me some good techniques and allowed me to complete some of them on him. Its actually great to have him there to show me the ropes. 

To end the class, they had 2 5 minute rounds of live rolling. Master Freddy had me watch for these 2 rounds as it was my first day and from what i understand most people during their first week do not live roll at this gym. He wants you to learn the basics, just to be safe and not hurt yourself or anyone else. I asked my cousin to stay after class as there is open mats so that he could teach me some more basic techniques. He showed me how to break guard and pass to side control, and the basics of posturing and trying to break posture when your on bottom. 

All in all i had a blast, i will be going back on wednesday to sign up officially. I plan on going Monday,Wednesdays and Open mat Saturdays to start while i get myself into shape. Then once the football playoffs end, ill do the sunday class that is instructed by one of the black belts. If anyone is wondering what gym im going to. Its in Southern California, its the Cia Paulista Gym in Monrovia, taught by Master Freddy Sabbatini.

In the chapter on sequencing, i.e., the ordering of items to learn for maximum effect, Ferriss uses Dave Camarillo's ""infuriatingly reliable"" BJJ students as an example sequencing producing solid results vs the standard fare:

&gt;*""In contrast, most world-famous black belts, often world-class athletes, teach a hodgepodge of random techniques. Daily classes are submissions du jour that leave students to assemble the puzzle themselves. Some succeed, but the vast majority fail. At the very least, students plateau for months or years at a time.* 

&gt;*There is no system, no clear progression.*

&gt;*Dave had what other coaches didn’t: a logical sequence.""*

This particular passage struck close to home for me, and I'm sure it will for many of you as well. At my current gym, the techniques presented more or less at random. *""It's knee-on-belly week. Next week will be foot sweep week. Oh, you have a question about the tomoe-nage to triangle combination? Let's explore that for an hour.""* Although I quite enjoy the openness, I feel I could be improving faster if my learning was structured.

**So, r/bjj, what progression of techniques do you believe is ideal for taking a white belt spaz to black belt competency?**

Also, if any of you happen to train directly under Camarillo, pretty please share his progression with us, if it's not against your end user licensing agreement.

Bonus: Some other interesting tidbits from the book to aid discussion

* Burden on the working memory (i.e. number of steps, introducing new movements, etc.) is what makes something easy or hard to learn.
* An interesting bit about chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin learning chess from the endgame first (also covered in greater detail in Waitzkin's own book, The Art of Learning) :

&gt; *""Josh’s original chess teacher, started their first class by taking him in reverse. The board was empty, except for three pieces in an endgame scenario: king and pawn against king. Through the micro, positions of reduced complexity, Josh was forced to learn the macro: principles. He learned the power of empty space, opposition, and setting an opponent up for zugzwang (a position where any move he makes will destroy his position). All from a near-empty board. By limiting himself to a few simple pieces, he mastered something limitless: high-level concepts he could apply anytime against anyone.""*

* Ferriss learned tango ridiculously fast in part by finding what tango masters learned late in their careers and focusing on that from the get-go.

* Ferriss recommends selecting techniques based on three questions: 1) What are commonalities among the best competitors? 2) Which of these aren't being actively taught in most classes? 3) Which neglected skills could you get good at abnormally quickly?",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,white-belt,True,t3_146tc0,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/146tc0/sequencing_bjj_in_what_order_should_techniques_be/,

1351575447.0,42,self.bjj,12bpvs,I got some stitches in my face tonight. Here's some perspective. ,digigoat,43,1,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/12bpvs/i_got_some_stitches_in_my_face_tonight_heres_some/,"Hi,

I'm here to state the obvious. I was training tonight and bumped heads with my training partner. Ended up with a few stitches. It's a contact sport, shit happens. The guy who stitched me up at the hospital, however, might have a different opinion. 

When the Dr. that stitched me up walked in and saw my bloody face, still wearing my gi pants, the first thing he said was ""where do you roll?"" Cool, I thought, a fellow BJJer to fix me up. 

Turns out he did use to train. Until he got one of his training partners in a triangle, and that training partner decided to stand up and then slam him to escape, literally breaking his back. He's been out of training for over a year, in pain, and extremely lucky that he isn't paralyzed. 

So, you get hurt, you can't do BJJ and not get hurt at some point. But don't be responsible for hurting your training partners. Bumping heads, twisting the wrong way, or landing awkwardly happens, and you'll get injured. But you're not in the UFC and it's not the Mundails. Chill the fuck out and just tap when you get caught. It's not worth seriously hurting yourself or your training partner because you don't want to tap. I don't think I'm alone when I say that I have a lot more respect for people who just tap and start over, rather than flipping a shit and spastically try to escape (even if they succeed), endangering themselves and everyone around them in the process.

Thanks for listening. Now it's time for my tube of neosporin and my face to make some sweet sweet love. ",,False,self,t5_2qn02,False,,blue-belt,True,t3_12bpvs,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/12bpvs/i_got_some_stitches_in_my_face_tonight_heres_some/,

This saturday my coach held a 2 hour Gi and No Gi seminar that was free to everyone including non members.  It was to raise money for one of our teammate/coach that had spent a week in the hospital without insurance.  We were able to raise $3,000 in donations that day.  That is what I love about BJJ.  It's not just a work out, it's more than that.  The people I train with have become my close friends. It like being part of a large family that is always there for each other.

Now I am not saying I am in this exact category, I just feel like I am in the biggest slump, hole or what ever you want to call it.

I feel like I hardly know any techniques.  If I did know them, I have forgotten them.  I am too predictable, meaning I go for the same positions every single roll or sparing session.  I depend way to much on my guard retention and sub defense.  

Part of this may be due to the fact that my training schedule had to be adjusted for other responsibilities.  I mean, I still love bjj.  I still have a passion for it, I just feel like I am spinning my tires.

Suggestions/stories/strategies would be appreciated.  

I do know this is a pretty generic thread, but I know i am not the only one to go through this, I know some of you have worked through similar situations. 

I am not looking for some universal magic remedy that will 'fix' me, maybe just others' experiences whether it was at blue, purple belt or higher....

Edit:  Lots of responses and suggestions.  I will try to respond shortly.  Sometimes work gets in the way of my reddit'ing.

Edit 2:  **Thanks for all the suggestions and ideas that you guys threw my way.  I appreciate it.  Routine is something I preach regularly and i think I have fallen out of mine.  This will be my first priority.  Second, I am going to start playing positions that I don't usually play.  And lastly, for those techniques of yester-year,  I am going to actively catch/use on each week.  Focus on hitting it, figure out when and why it works for me and move forward.**

1355261213.0,37,self.bjj,14op62,"Very happy about changes at my gym, Gracie Barra Clearwater",Aesopian,48,11,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/14op62/very_happy_about_changes_at_my_gym_gracie_barra/,"So you're going to have to forgive me for bragging about my school, but we recently took big steps by moving to a much bigger, much nicer building and expanding our BJJ programs. About 9 years ago, I got started in BJJ thanks to a Sherdog poster steering me away from kung fu and karate by pointing me to what became my school (where I'm now a black belt and a certified instructor), so I hope a post like this can do that for someone else.

If you had stopped by Gracie Barra Clearwater over the years (maybe back when used to be called Gracie Barra Tampa), and you would say the training was good but the gym was... ""barebones,"" to put it nicely. Basically it was an just industrial warehouse unit with some mats and not much else. A lot of you have seen it through the instructional photos/videos I've done over the years. Concrete floors, one tiny bathroom, no A/C, and a railroad track literally out the back door. We always talked about how we should get a bigger place, how we should market better, but never really following through.

That is until recently. My instructor, Eduardo de Lima, has been taking big steps to improve the experience for all students and grow Gracie Barra Clearwater into a professional martial arts studio. After months of planning and renovations, we've moved into our new bigger, nicer, better location that's right in the center of town. 

To give you an idea of the jump, the first training area alone is bigger than our entire old gym (I think it's about 1500 sq ft). There's a second space that will be renovated into an even bigger mat space once we have the funding. We now also have separate men's and women's bathrooms, separate men's and women's changing rooms, a real lobby with a pro shop, real storage space for cleaning supplies. Hell, there's even free wifi and an all-natural, all-organic vending machine.

Those of you interested in how the Gracie Barra class structure works, here's a message I wrote for my gym's Facebook page:
&gt;Like a lot of the long time students, I remember how when I started, I just got tossed into a group class before I even knew how to tie a belt, then had to bumble through warm-ups I didn't know, do more push ups than I'd ever done in my life, then be put up against the higher belts to spar (while trying to not pass out from heat stroke). After class, it was left up to me to figure out how to pay for classes and how buy my first gi, then let to wander away, maybe to never return. (This is also after it took me three tries to find the old gym back in the warehouses.)
&gt;
&gt;So I understand the old school pride and the ""you kids have it easy these days"" attitude of old timers. Many of you from the garage days have much gnarlier stories than I do, and I'm one of the kids who had it easy in your eyes. Those were special times to train and learn jiu-jitsu.
&gt;
&gt;As we approached the opening of the new school and I got involved with the planning, I had my own concerns. Would we be ""losing"" something by splitting the classes up? Would we be ""softening"" or ""dilluting"" jiu-jitsu to appeal to a broader market? What if I liked our gym being ""underground"" because I'm a jiu-jitsu hipster who did it ""before it was cool""? With all of these changes, would it be the same school I loved? 
&gt;
&gt;You may have your own answers those questions, but for me, after teaching and training in the new classes, and seeing the new business practices in action, I am very happy to report that all of my concerns have disappeared. The changes have been for the best of the school, the students (even the crusty higher belts) and Eduardo. The new system has only raised the standards for training, and given the school a real chance to grow and attract new students.
&gt;
&gt;After seeing the way the new classes run, and the other changes to the business operations of the school, here's what I see us ""losing"":
&gt;
&gt;- Getting to inflate our ego with the ""pride"" of being ""too tough"" for 90% of new people.
&gt;- A needless risk of injury that often ended new students' journeys into BJJ before they really started.
&gt;- Classes where the instructor has to walk the tightrope between teaching green beginners and seasoned competitors, only to leave both disappointed.
&gt;- The attitude that ""jiu-jitsu just isn't for everyone"" that comes from not knowing how to give people the right kind of training they need in their personal development.
&gt;
&gt;And, sorry, but the hair and lint tumbleweeds are no more thanks to heightened cleaning standards.
&gt;
&gt;We aren't cutting out sparring, we aren't lowering the standards for earning belts, we aren't selling belts, we aren't ""softening"" the training for the experienced guys. In fact, I've had some of the toughest and most technical training in years at the new Black Belt classes, since Eduardo is now free to really let out the techniques he's had to hold back not because he wants to but because he has to struggle with making the a single class ""work"" for everyone. We've been doing takedowns and sparring from standing in almost every class so far, and up to an hour of sparring. Like I've been telling the class every time I teach, by making a place for the beginners, we've opened up room at the top for the higher belts to get the training they need too.

If anyone is reading this as an MMA fan looking for a BJJ gym (like I was), or if you're just in town for a week, let me know and I'll make sure to personally meet you at the gym and put in some good training.

The best place to contact the school is through the Facebook fan page:
