Seven hundred eighty-nine at the moment. Made by me, so they vary wildly in quality. They're mostly traditional fantasy themed but with a few oddballs.

They're black and white, designed to be easily modifiable. Stencils, gradients, paint-overs, whatever. The six colour ones at the start of the imgur album are a five minute scribble-job to show the kind of thing I'd expect people to do to them.

If you want to use them for your game, or indeed any other purpose, feel free. I'd get a kick out of someone putting them to good use, so do let me know if you make something cool with them. 

If they'd be perfect but you really need an icon of a bunch of electrified grapes or a hell-walrus, then let me know and I'll see what I can do. No guarantees though.

I don't have my own web hosting but here's [a zip file containing a high-resolution image of each individual icon](http://www.sendspace.com/file/k7njh1) on sendspace.

Since then it has taken off on the internet and became an urban myth. There are stories, pictures and videos about it all over the place.

Now games are starting to emerge and this one called Slender (still in beta) is by far the freakiest.

Thank you for reading!

~~**Update**: Thanks everyone! We've sent out 185 keys so far. We've passed 200 upvotes, meaning an additional 60 keys are available! I'm stepping away from the computer occasionally but you should receive your key within an hour of commenting. I'll update here if I'll be away for longer.~~

~~**Update 2**: We've reached 200 upvotes! I'm going to be stepping away for a few hours. But will be back to send out more keys before I log out for the night.~~

~~**Update 3**: Thank you everyone for the support, it means a lot to us =) I'm off to bed now but there are still quite a few keys left to hand out and I will do that first thing when I wake up tomorrow.~~

**Update 4**: Good mornin! All 185 available keys have been sent out. However we only need a little over 100 more upvotes to release another 200 keys, so spread the word! :) In the meantime, we're increasing the duration of our 40% off sale by another 24 hours.

**Update 5**: Alright looks like we wont hit 500 upvotes, but 400 is pretty damn awesome and honestly we weren't even expecting half of that so thank you everyone :) Despite that, we're still gonna be handing out more keys until later tonight. So if you've requested one already, I will get around to you :) Thanks again everyone, and if you could throw us an upvote on [Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92936348) if you enjoy it, we'd appreciate the help!

So you guys might know me from /r/gamedev where I recently made a post about [Black Annex](http://www.blackannex.net) which is a game I've spent the past year creating in QBASIC and just announced to the world the other day. (Btw, it's written in QBASIC but not compiled in it, it links to SDL so it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. This is probably the MAIN thing I got asked in my last post)

In brief, the game's basically my love-letter to the games I grew up obsessing over (Basically Bullfrog games, mostly) and I just wanted a fun, Syndicate style game with some fun-to-mess-with AI and little aspects of hacking, espionage and stealth. It's been a year of arguing with QBASIC to get the whole thing to actually exist in a playable state but it's finally something that I think some people would actually enjoy playing!

Anyway, I finally worked up the guts to put the thing on [Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=112030991) because I had a couple of smaller digital distributors offer me contracts for it. The thing's taken off like crazy and it seriously looks like I might literally end up getting a game written entirely in QBASIC on Steam in the forseeable future.

Anyway, I thought I'd throw a link down here if you guys wanted to take a look. Everyone in /r/gamedev has been incredibly supportive and they're one of the main reasons I've kept chugging along at this thing. I didn't even realize there was an IndieGaming subreddit until today so I thought I'd show up here, too!

I hope you guys like the look of Black Annex!

PS: If anything about this post is against the rules can you guys just let me know and I'll edit it up? I'm really new to reddit overall and never posted in /r/IndieGaming before.

edit: I've got a little page up on [IndieDB](http://www.indiedb.com/games/black-annex) if that's a thing people do, too.

edit 2: Wow, I just woke up and you guys have help so much! This is literally going to get a game made in QBASIC on Steam.

If you follow indie games, you probably have heard of Monaco.  People have been talking about it for a while (and lamenting at the dev time, jeez guys, 3 years ain't the long!), since it won the 2010 IGF Grand Prize and Design awards.  It's a Single Player or multiplayer Heist game, played from a top-down perspective.  I like to think of it as Pac-man meets Hitman, or Gauntlet meets Ocean's 11.

Well we're in beta!  The game will be coming to one (unspecified) console as well as PC via steam.  I need your help to make the final game polished, accessible, and balanced!

***I'll be giving ~~5~~ 10 steam beta codes to commenters who show a certain style and panache (and enthusiasm for helping out!)***  My plan is to do another beta key giveaway on Friday.  Have at thee!

**TLDR**; Be nice, comment, and get a steam beta code for Monaco, the IGF winning co-op heist game.


**EDIT**: ~~If we can get that upvotey number to 100 I'll give away 10 keys!~~  And don't downvote other commenters, it won't help you.  I'm not just choosing the top comments :)

Just to be quick here and to stop some of the lesser quality posts:



**1) No ""reminder"" posts for crowd-supported projects (Kickstarter/IndieGoGo/Greenlight), except for one in the last 48 hours. Submissions about new projects or major updates to existing ones are allowed.**


This one is from /r/games. I think it could help the constant spam of projects.





**2) No ""XXX/YYY is finally released/announced/updated"" posts unless they come directly from the dev/store/whatever site.**

Lots of people are using this to get hits to their site, that's not cool and it's pretty much blogspam. Unless you are submitting original content with it (like a review, interview...) with it, don't do it.

So what's ok? Let's say Terry Cavanagh releases ZZZZZZ. Post the link from his site, the Steam/whatever page, even a tweet from him works.

Also, if you are a developer. You can create a self post if you don't have a site.

Just please, no more empty articles that add nothing.



**3) No ""general"" URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc).**

Don't do this, not even on the comments. Reddit will shadowban you eventually (I can't control this).



**4) And for the love of IndieGaming, please stop sending me your games so I post them here. I'm just a mod guys!**


That's pretty much it. Thanks everyone for your time and keep submitting cool and new stuff.

PD: Please help me enforce these rules by reporting and posts and if you have some time, PM me telling me what happened, thanks :)

I thought you might be interested in my journey from someone who literally knows **nothing** about programming to a published game developer. I know that this type of post would have been really helpful for me when was just getting started. Hopefully I can inspire someone in a similar situation!

**THE STORY**

About a year and a half ago, I decided that I wanted to make a game. There was a problem though. A big problem: **I hadn’t programmed a day in my life.**

I always thought it would be pretty sweet to be a game developer but it was so out of reach that it never felt like a realistic goal. But one day in October of 2010 I just decided to go for it. I had nothing to lose so why not?

I learned bits and pieces of a bunch of languages, including C, Python, ActionScript, and Objective-C. Honestly though, I really don’t think it matters too much what languages you learn on. If there is one piece of advice that I can share about learning to program, it is this: **PROGRAM A LOT**. There really is no other way to learn besides doing, doing, doing, doing, and doing again. Every time you make something new, you find a thousand things that you did wrong before. Every time, you chisel away at your horrible programming skills until you’re finally able to make something that you can be proud of.

Along the way I made a ton of stupid, fun, and weird mini-games to help me learn. I made:

* [A game about a man-rodent](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dtplj/thought_you_might_be_interested_in_my_very_first/) hiding in a town, attacking the townspeople
* [A text-based minesweeper clone]( http://youtu.be/Cn_Oibc4sjg) with a custom-sized board and mine-count
* [A game called Pizza Guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLumD97DX8), about a guy who had to (you guessed it) deliver a pizza while trying to jump over an endless barrage of pipes of varying heights. The only result was loss. There was no win.
* [A game called Party Man](http://www.whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1000000423.png), in which the the protagonist is driving along a grid, trying to reach a party. The problem was that my programming was still pretty bad at that point, so he kept literally crashing the party.
* [An app where you could create sequences of musical phrases](http://youtu.be/xWMsBGEwvbY) in the pentatonic scale
* [A flash clone of the classic snake game](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)
* [A flash clone of those driving-through-an-ever-shrinking-tunnel games](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)

Finally, I decided it was time to make a real game. Pretty much all of Polymer’s creation was iterative design. I never had an overall plan. I kept thinking, “I don’t know how to make a complete game. I just know how to make basic gameplay,” as if there were one way to make a game. But I realized I just need to make it however I could, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right or best way.

When I sent the game to beta testers, I was convinced that all I really needed to do was polish it up a bit. Oh man was I wrong. I had so many amazing suggestions from my testers that I just had to implement. I probably said, “I’ve only got one or two more things to add, then I’m done!” a thousand times.

Submitting to the app store was terrifying. I was so paranoid that I would forget something huge. Something that could break the game or get it rejected. But at the same time, it felt amazing. I finally did it. My creation, my baby, was done. I went from not knowing a thing about programming to finishing a game that I was very very proud of.

It’s already gotten some awesome previews on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/19/hands-on-with-whitaker-trebellas-polymer/), [Indie Game Mag](http://mobile.indiegamemag.com/looking-shapely-polymer-teaser-trailer/) and [Gamezebo](http://www.gamezebo.com/games/polymer/preview).

Of course, I hope Polymer sells well. But even if it doesn’t, I’m proud of myself for actually carrying this whole dream through. I’ve had trouble in the past making the journey from start to finish on big projects. Starting is easy. Finishing isn’t. Plus, programming Polymer has taught me so many amazing things. There’s a lot of really messy spaghetti code, but I honestly don’t care too much because it works. Next time I make a game I’ll be able to build upon what I’ve learned, and hopefully make something even more awesome. Until then though, I’m hoping for the best with Polymer. And I hope you enjoy it!

**TLDR:**

* A year and a half ago, I had no clue how to program

* Today my first game, Polymer, was released to the iTunes app store

* I did all the programming, music, and art

* It's 50% off for launch!

1348610173.0,144,self.IndieGaming,10h1lk,I just released my first game - Colour Bind - on Steam. Code giveaway and competition inside!,Dinaroozie,201,57,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/10h1lk/i_just_released_my_first_game_colour_bind_on/,"Hi /r/indiegaming! I have just released my first game - it’s called Colour Bind, and it’s a highly challenging physics/puzzle/platformer. There’s more info to be had at [the official page](http://www.colourbind.com/) or [the Steam page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/208710/).

Since it's just launched, we've got a couple of things going on. First off, is the normal one - we're giving away some copies of the game! I’ve posted a hundred Steam codes below. If you claim one, it’s all yours - let me know which one in the comments, so we know how many are left.

Second off, if you think you're good at this kind of game, you have the opportunity to win some (physical) trophies! This is a bit experimental but basically, be the first to unlock one of the more fiendish achievements, we send you a trophy! You can also win a trophy by making the coolest level submitted to the Steam Workshop (there’s a level editor). [Competition info is here.](http://www.colourbind.com/blog/colour-bind-competition/)

So that's it! The game's real hard, so if you don't like that kind of thing you'll probably wind up hating me, but I've found that people who like both puzzles and challenging physics games really get into it. I hope you enjoy it!


**Edit:** Sorry for the duplicate error codes and whatnot - I'm striking through as fast as I can, and failing to keep up rather spectacularly.

**Second edit:** It looks like all the codes are just about gone - if you want to pick through the unstruckthrough ones, there might be one or two available ones still lurking, but since these went so fast I'm going to round up some new ones - stay tuned!

**More keys!** Okay so since those went pretty quickly, and I suspect some shenanigans might have occurred with bots grabbing them or something, I'm going to post some more but in the form of an image. Hopefully this isn't too much more annoying - I failed almost completely to keep up with the strikethrough thing anyway. [100 Steam codes away!](http://imgur.com/PqFp0)

**Third Edit:** The text codes were all taken and taking up lots of space, so I removed them. The image link above still has some going though. :)

**Fourth Edit:** It looks like that recent batch of 100 are just about done. I might, maybe, be able to post some more in a little bit. Until then, an amazingly fabulous reddit alien level was posted by my friend over in the [thread at /r/gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10h33y/i_just_released_my_first_indie_game_on_steam). If you've got the game, you can get the level on Steam Workshop. :)

**Fifth edit:** I cross-posted this to /r/gaming, and I'm going to hang out there and answer any questions about the game people might have, so feel free to join me [over at that thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10h33y/i_just_released_my_first_indie_game_on_steam/)

**Holy crap this is a lot of edits:** Here are [another 100 Steam codes](http://imgur.com/Q3mcS) - have at it!

**Seventh edit:** I didn't know about the one hour lockout thing that Steam does, but since a lot of people are missing out because of that, I'll be posting a fresh batch in an hour or so - stay tuned!

**Edit the eighth:** I need to get some breakfast (Australia time), but I'll be back soon. I have been advised to post [another 200 steam codes](http://imgur.com/c0lgI) to keep things interesting while I'm away.

**And in closing:** Okay guys and girls, I've got to call it a day at this point. My initial plan was to keep track of the keys and reply to all the comments, but I see now that that was folly. Things turned into a bit of a crapshoot at the end there, but it seems like a decent number of keys were successfully transferred so that's pretty good. I'm massively appreciative of all the feedback and the number of people who are trying out the game now - I really hope you like it! Judging by the comments, it is my suspicion that there are a couple of valid keys left in that last batch of 200, and there might be some lurking in the other batches too, for a sufficiently patient gamer. For those who got a key, or didn't but get the game anyway, I hope you have fun!

But then recently I thought; “There may be people out there who have not seen all I have seen, and could use some suggestions!” So, without further ado, years of dedicated searching presented to you in convenient list format:

- Iji (http://remar.se/daniel/iji.php) [Windows, sidescroller shooter] This is a quite spectacular metroidian game, with fantastic music and an intriguing plot. Lots of hidden easter eggs enhance the re-playability, and the in game humor completes it to make it well worth the four plus years it took the artist to create it, hot drinks and all.

- Cave Story (www.cavestory.org) [Windows, Mac, Linux, etc... sidescroller shooter] This wouldn't be a real list without Cave Story. Do I even need to go into detail here? Probably the most famous free indie platformer out there, it has a story, awesome music, and again, great replayability. Play it now. (Huzzah!)

- Battleships Forever (http://www.wyrdysm.com/games.php) [Windows, RTS-ish] An interesting, RTS like game. But that isn't it's main credit, the most fun you can have with this is the built-in shipmaker which let's you construct your own armadas and set them against each other. Lasers, lasers everywhere!

- The Cleaner (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/26070-the-cleaner) [Windows, sidescroller shooter] Nothing special graphic wise, but it's fun. Teleport across strange worlds, enjoy the interesting artistic style of the game,  meet many fascinating specials of new creatures, and kill them with a unique arsenal of spells. And don't scare Spoofy.

- The Tank Game (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/6777-the-tank-game) [Windows, top-down shooter] The title says it all. Tanks. Explosions. Guns. No plot to get in the way of the sea of robotic tank carnage. As the project was abandoned almost complete and then taken up again by someone else the some of the sprites look a bit odd, but that shouldn't matter. Graphics shouldn't be the only quality in a game... (UPLINK LOST)

- Amea (http://armorgames.com/play/10487/amea) [Online, Sidescroller survival horror shooter thing] A fun little online game, Amea has an interesting plot and some fun boss fights. Don't trust you're eyes...

- Naev (http://blog.naev.org/) [Windows, Mac, Linux, space RPG] A fairly awesome exploration and quest based space game, you make money, trade, do quests, and who could forget, fight. Not finished (meaning that updates come out occasional, and the mission sequence isn't complete) it should last several hours at least. It has some nice music too. Who ever thought someone would love hotdogs so much?

- Battle Tanks II (http://download.cnet.com/BattleTanks-II/3000-2119_4-10660827.html) [Windows, Tank FPS] Battle Tanks II is fun for some good ol' tank kablooie. Featuring debatably historically accurate tanks from WWII, this game has you pilot your tank against the enemy forces (up to three), capture their spawn points, and claim victory! If you enjoy it, I'd suggest looking for the expansion packs... after you get those, you can see the tank files they modified and even make you're own tanks!… No, I can't think of a single game related easter egg to say here.

- SUAVE (Sport Utility Assault Vehicle Extreme) (http://www.curlysworldoffreeware.com/games/view/482) [Windows, Tank FPS] SUAVE is a fun little game, the main noticeable feature being the fact that you're tank is equipped with a time distortion unit. The rest of the game may be completely standard, but nothing beats dodging about in slow-mo. “You can't hit me! You can't hit my tiny little... tank.”

- Gang Garrison 2 (http://ganggarrison.com/) [Windows, Multiplayer sidescroller shooter] It's what Team Fortress 2 would have looked like a while ago. It's playability seems a bit questionable now that TF2 is free, but hey, it's still a bit of fun. POOTIS.

- Raging Skies (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/24115-raging-skies) [Windows, top down shooter] Nothing graphically exciting here, but it's a fun little game with some nice characters and some good humor. All shall fear the wrath of the mighty Spoonman!

- Return To Sector Nine (http://www.pugfuglygames.com/Game.php?game=10) [Windows, mostly top down shooter] Want your own arcade in your home? Then R2S9 is a good pick. It features fast paced arcade gameplay, and many many levels. Unlock new ships, weapons, and medals! And kill those space bugs over, and over, and over...

- Phosphor (http://www2.rasterwerks.com/game/phosphor/beta2.asp) [Windows, Mac, FPS] What with TF2 being free, I don't know if this needs to be on here, but hey. Nothing exciting graphically but it is fun in it's own way.

- Legend Of Johnny (http://www.maxgames.com/play/legend-of-johnny.html) [Online, sidescroller shooter] Save your girlfriend from demons! It's a bit glitchy, but fun.

- Mud and Blood (http://www.mudandblood.net/mudandbloodz.html) [Online, RTS-ish] Take command of a WWII squad and repel the invading germans. Decide what to call down, snipers, a medic, or an air strike?

- Pixel Legions (http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/536743) [Online, RTS... kinda sorta maybe] Command your army of little dots against opposing armies of little dots. To pixel Victory!

- Planet Earth Crusaders (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/66263-planet-earth-crusaders) [Windows, top down shooter] Save the earth. With guns. Choose from a variety of soldier types to repel the Cyborg invasion through control point battles. Nothing extraordinary, but it's fun.

- Avert Fate (http://unity3d.com/gallery/live-demos/avert-fate) [Windows, Mac, FPS] It's short but sweet. If you've been waiting for me to say “It has good graphics”, well here you are. It *does* have good graphics. Unfortunately it's just a tech demo, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun fifteen minutes.

- Black Shades (http://www.wolfire.com/black-shades) [Windows, Mac, FPS] Did you like slowing down time in SUAVE? Well here's some more time based fun. Protect mr. blocky from blocky assassins in a blocky city full of blocky people. It's like Minecraft meets James Bond. Or something.

- Assassin Blue (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/44391-assassin-blue) [Windows, sidescroller] Play as an assassin, codenamed Blue. You hit stuff with a sword, and you wear a hat. This is important later. Like most of the sidescrollers here, the graphics are oldschool, but that's how it's meant to be. And if you don't like that, what are you doing looking at this list? Get back to the store!

- Deep Magic (http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/127-deep-magic) [Windows, sidescroller] The main interest for this game is spell variety. It's not as fun as The Cleaner, but it has it's own charm. There's a sequel, but I never really got around to it...


That's it for me. At least four years of searching and playing is above this. I hope at least one of those is enjoyable to you, and if you have anything that would fit on this list you'd like to recommend, please do! (Also, if you need any hints... feel free. Some of those can be frustrating) Have fun!

Trying to get as much feedback on the game while building up more fans to help push it through Steam's Greenlight when it launches. Figured I'd just set it to free for a few days, enjoy!
So if you have any feedback, send it my way.

Also check out the Facebook page for future news on Chester and my next project: http://www.facebook.com/BrilliantBlueG

**Update:** My intention with this was for the game to be free to own if you got it in the 48 hours, but with how Desura is set up it looks like it may just be free to play for those 48 hours.  I've sent an email to Desura for confirmation on this.

If it ends up that it isn't being tied to your accounts, I'll be setting up a page to give away registration keys for the game that will give it to you forever.

**Update 2:** Wow, over 2,000 new installs today alone and Chester is currently the #1 viewed game on Chester.  Thanks a lot for the support!

**Update 3:**  Looks like you'll be able to play the game as long as you leave it installed, but you won't be able to reinstall after the 48 hours.  That's no good!  
Once the 48 hours ends I'll be putting it back on a 90% sale for people that want to buy it for $1 and work on setting up a page for people to get a key if they want a free install. 

I *might* do it through the [Brilliant Blue-G Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/brilliantblueg) (Agh I know, a lot of you dislike Facebook. Sorry. D:) to A- keep people from getting endless keys too easily and B- If you follow Brillaint Blue-G you'll know exactly when Chester goes up on Greenlight. (Which was one of the main reasons behind this!)
After looking into it some more, might also use a reddit bot to send keys.",,False,self,t5_2r0e3,1343147121.0,,,True,t3_x0nju,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/x0nju/instead_of_a_90_sale_for_chester_decided_to_just/,

My goal with this game was to create a relaxing atmosphere and a sense of discovery. I designed the game to be simple/casual, but with a lot of strategic depth behind the simple rules. I wanted to make something really unique.

[Download](http://star-twine.net/download.html)

The full version is $9.99 CAD and there is a free demo as well.


Features:
 
* Unlimited number of procedurally generated levels
* Skirmish mode with multiple difficulties
* Online 1 vs 1 multiplayer and LAN play
* Fully 3D maps where attacks can come from any angle
* Ambient electronic soundtrack and abstract visuals which create an atmospheric, relaxing experience
* Simple RTS gameplay that emphasizes positioning and timing rather than micro-management

At the moment not a lot of people know about it so there isn't really much online multiplayer happening, but that should change if it gets more exposure.

Hey everyone, I noticed in another Starbound thread here at /r/IndieGaming that most people felt there wasn't enough info on the game yet for them to get interested.  I've decided to compile a list of information, or at least links to information that might sway some of you.

I think a great place to start would be [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ5mt1pMuaI).  While I don't care much for the ""Lets compare this game to that game"", it is an excellent source of information.  Like in the alpacapatrol video, this one is dated a bit, but it showcases a lot of the major features.  In this video LastGreyWolf uses a phrase that I think sums up Starbound perfectly; ""Next fucking level"".  

The largest source of information currently would most likely have to be the [List of Announced Game Information](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/list-of-announced-game-information-updated-april-3.450/) post on the official forums.  As the title suggests, this thread contains just about all the information currently available.

**What is Starbound about?**

I keep seeing this question pop up, so I thought I answer to the best of my knowledge.  Starbound is about exploration.  Tiy, the lead developer, has mentioned in an early interview that one of his main inspirations comes from Star Trek.  He mentioned that he wanted a sort of ""Adventure of the week"" feeling.  Going to a new planet was like an entirely new adventure.  

Better than I could ever do, the developers have an [excellent explanation of what Starbound is about](http://playstarbound.com/about/)

**Notable Information**

One of the coolest features I think about Starbound, is how in depth the universe/planets will be.  [Here is a great article regarding navigation between planets](http://playstarbound.com/navigating-the-stars/).  Notice there are several planets in this one system.  Each planet has its own unique size, gravity, weather, biomes, temperature, flora, fauna, npcs, dungeons, cities, difficulty level and more.  These things are all procedurally generated, and done so in a very intelligent way.  The gravity of the planet is dependent on it's size.  Its weather and temperature are dependent on its distance from its star AND the type of star. It's biomes are dependent on its weather and temperature. Etc etc etc.  You aren't going to find an icy planet that's right next to a hot star for example.  Another thing I think is worth noting; those planets on the starmap aren't just for show.  If you land on a planet with another planet close by, you might see it in the sky orbiting the sun. [Here is an example of that](http://pikigeek.com/files/2012/02/Starbound-2.jpg).  You can see a planet and several moons (which you can visit by the way) in the sky.  Those planets are there because they are actually found in the same system, not just randomly painted in.


Multiplayer will work like Neverwinter Nights.  For those unfamiliar with that, to me it also seems similar to DayZ.  Basically, according to the settings the server owner has put in place, you will either be able to bring your already established character into the server, or start a new character specifically for that server (sort of like servers connected to the main hive vs private hives in DayZ).  

Starbound will allow for **heavy modding**.  Lua scripting allows for practically any change to be made, including **adding in new blocks** rather than simply modifying textures.  *Tiy* ~ ""If you want to add a new block into the game, you draw it, you write a configuration file - it takes two minutes, and that block is in the game. You can spawn it, you can use it, it has it's own properties etc.""  ""When you join a server that has files that you don't have, similar to source engine games, it gets those files.  So a server owner can just throw what ever they want in there, and it just works.""

It was left at that, so I wasn't sure whether it would be ok to post again. So today I messaged the whole mod team. I have redacted the mod's names, as I want this to be a Public Service Announcement, not a witchhunt:

------

**to /r/gaming/**

Hello!

I am an indie game developer, and a couple weeks ago I was threatened with a ban by Mod1 for ""self-promoting"" my free game on your subreddit.

In the next few days, I will be releasing a new update for the game. Since I was kind of left hanging, I wanted to check with you all to see whether I will/won't get banned if I post it.

Thanks for your time!

------

**from Mod2[M]**

Hi Berick,

By the looks of it your account is still incredibly lopsided in terms of promotion. Unless you right that, any further promotion would indeed be grounds for serious action (not just in /gaming, but site-wide).

I would strongly read over the User Agreement before taking any action.

------

**to Mod2** (Taken from the UA. Additional emphasis my own)

**It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own** or otherwise benefit from in some way

If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it, you're almost certainly a spammer. - **The majority of my time spent on Reddit is reading, commenting, and up / downvoting.**

If your contribution to Reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way - **I can see where you could be blindly applying this to me, but my game is free and my devblog is un-monetized. If I could host my game through IMGUR (which according to Mod1 is apparently the only acceptable way to ""self-promote""?) I would. But I can't, so instead I'm hosting it through a free blog.** 

If people historically downvote your links - **N/A**

If people historically upvote your links [...] congratulations! It's almost certainly not spam. - **I've gotten several (granted, not a lot) upvotes, and very helpful development feedback from lots of people who found my game via my Reddit posts.**

don't flood the new queue - **Unless you feel that once every couple weeks is flooding your new queue, this is not applicable either.**

To play it safe, write to the moderators of the community - **Which is what I'm doing now. If you don't want your readers to be informed of a free indie game that they might enjoy, that's your choice, but I don't think they would appreciate that.**

Like I told Mod1, do you really want people to have to throw together 9 asinine memes for every piece of original content they have to offer?

------

**from Mod2[M]**

First off, this has nothing to do with whether or not we want our readers to know about this game, or that game... this website, or that website.

This has to do with your behavior, plain and simple. So don't attempt to confuse the issue.

The fact remains that over the past month an enormous amount of your participation here on Reddit has been towards promotion. Primiarily your game ""Dread"", the RDF Redstones stuff... heck, even the Alaska stuff looks fishy.

And I should say at this point that I'm saying this not strictly as a moderator for /gaming. I'm actually here as an adjunct from /reportthespammers, which means my semi-official capacity here on Reddit is one of spam identification, removal and prevention.

So when I tell you that your behavior is lopsided in terms of promotion, I want you to know that message is coming from someone who's charged with removing that very same behavior site-wide. So these are not just /gaming's rules we're talking about, nor my or Mod1's rules, but rather the site's rules.

That some moderators are more lenient while others more strict, or because some users get away with the problem for longer, does not change the fact that what your'e doing is outside the boundaries of preferred behavior and that means it can and may very well hold consequences for your account, your domains, and other matters hitherto unmentioned and unspecified.

And now you've had two warnings from moderators.

All that being said, I'm not trying to be rude or mean. None of this is personal. If I'm sounding harsh it's because I want you to fully understand what your behavior means for you.

Now, if you want to promote your stuff, that's fine... but you must remain within the confines of the rules. And no, don't just submit a bunch of image memes to offset the balance (we actually do filter for that sort of behavior).

Otherwise, buy an ad.

------

**from Mod1[M]**

In addition to what Mod2 said, I wasn't threatening you with a ban from reddit; those only come from the admins. I was just saying that excessive self-promotion means someone would probably end up reporting you to the admins, and they might decide to ban you.

------

**to Mod2**

Don't worry, I'm not taking this as personal, or rude, or mean. I really do appreciate your clarifications on things.

Perhaps you can help define ""Promotion"" for me. As what you are describing above seems specifically targeted against content creators, even when their content is free.

Let's say a person makes and posts awesome info-graphics, funny .gifs, rage comics, etc... They are, by what you are defining, self-promoting and should therefore be banned?

What is the difference between ""Hey, check out funny cat pic I took"" and ""Hey, check out this cool game I made""?

------

**to Mod1**

Oh, I know you only have the power to ban me from /r/gaming. And I did/do appreciate the warning. I just think that you guys are incorrectly labeling content creators as spammers.

------

**from Mod1[M]**

Only when content creators spam their content to reddit.

------

**to Mod1**

I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but I feel that your definition of spam is absurd.

------

**from Mod2[M]**

While I can see where you're coming from to a certain degree, the issue isn't whether or not a user is creating/providing content, but rather what effect they have on the community as a whole.

When any user (or group of users) puts their interests here over the health of the community... regardless of if they're trying to sell off-license viagra or trying to drum up a lot of attention for a charity... it's a problem.

Constantly promoting something makes reddit less enjoyable for other users. Thus it's the behavior and not the profit model that defines spam and motivates our actions.

------

**to Mod2**

I, too, can see where you're coming from to a certain degree. For example, rage comics submitted to /r/writing would be spam. But that doesn't mean that all rage comics are spam. They have their place, and are welcome and sought after in numerous subreddits.

I ask you then, how is a free game not healthy for the /r/gaming community? If I was making a new post every day, I certainly could see how that would be spam. But a post every 2 to 3 weeks and only when there are new additions worth mentioning?

------

**from Mod2[M]**

The truth is that any restriction we place on what users can and cannot post will be seen as unpopular. We've done our best, through polling and careful implementation, to arrive at a system that seems to work best for the reddit community as a whole.

It is not in place to keep you from making users aware of your game, but rather to ensure that you do it in the way most respectful to our other users.

If these restrictions don't work for you, I sincerely suggest you buy an ad as they're not bound by the same rules.

------

**to Mod2**

I understand, and respect that. What I am trying to help you understand, is that your current restriction model is terribly lopsided against anything except imgur links (a bit hyperbolic, but hopefully you understand what I mean).

A lone indie dev like me does not have the time to go around scouring the net for other people's work to submit to fulfill your 1/10 quota. Nor do I have a reason to buy an ad for a free game I'm making in my spare time.

I will no longer post anything Dread related to /r/gaming. Perhaps, your readers will get lucky and a fan will. I will also inform other indie devs of your rules, so that they will not risk being banned either.

------

**from Mod3[M]**

And what we are trying to help you understand is that we aren't trying to cater to content creators, we are trying to cater to/attract/encourage people being active reddit users and community participants.

The 10% rule isn't designed to be a quota for people who want free advertising to meet, it is designed to be a restriction to weed out people trying to get free advertising while leaving those who are just submitting things they find and like and think the community will like. Reddit is not designed to be a platform for content creators to flock to in order to utilize an audience, it is a community of people sharing common interests.

If you are only here for advertising purposes and do not intend on being an active and balanced reddit user then the best option for you is to purchase an ad.

That said, we appreciate the fact that you're respecting the rules. I wish you luck with your game.

------

**to Mod3**

I definitely understand the need to weed out the people looking to use Reddit for free advertising. But I hope you understand that there is a difference between advertising something and submitting something you made for the communities enjoyment / benefit (i.e. every rage comic, meme image, picture of a cat, etc...). I'm sure I don't want to see Reddit devolve into just another picture board anymore than you do.

And thank you Mod3 :)

We were sick of the constant overtime, of dumbing down our games for the non-existent ""average gamer"", and of someone else reaping all the rewards, while the team got the sack.

We've had some savings, a good deal of experience and contacts, and a clear idea on what we want to do. What could go wrong?

Our first game, [a mature retelling of Cinderella with heavy emphasis on player choices](http://moacube.com/games/cinders/), was supposed to take around half a year to complete. That's what our savings allowed us for, with maybe a tiny buffer. Between [some production trouble](http://moacube.com/blog/cinders-postmortem-2-production-and-business/) and our own perfectionism, it took a year and a half.

We've had to stretch *really* thin to make it. I still remember having to decide between paying the rent and the electricity bill, pondering if they'll cut my power off before they will throw me out of my apartment, and if I can still finish the game then. Today, it's just a funny story I tell to my friends when we go out for a beer. But back then -- holy shit was I stressed!

Still, we've somehow made it through living like ascetics and borrowing money from friends and family. The game eventually came out! 

It wasn't a huge hit or anything, but it gathered [a lot of good press](http://moacube.com/news/what-the-press-says-about-cinders/) and -- most importantly -- the players liked it. It was enough to get us out of our debts and secure some profit. We actually started living off doing what we love!

It's been a year since the release now, and we're still making a humble-but-steady living from the sales of our games. In this time, I was able to release another smaller title and make significant progress on a bigger project. It seems that, if we're persistent, there are prospects of more substantial profits in the future.

So, why am I writing this? 

I hope that my story will serve as an inspiration for some of you. Becoming a full-time indie is hard as hell, but the rewards are *so* worth it. If you believe you have something really special -- keep at it. Even (or especially) when things get rough. If it all goes down the shithole, you can always get back to an office job. But you will absolutely hate yourself forever if you won't even try.

I would also like to voice my thanks. To the indie gaming community as a whole, and to redditors in specific. Reddit has been our primary source of traffic, inspiration, useful info, and feedback.

I don't know if we could make without you. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2r0e3,1371899578.0,,,True,t3_1gun3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1gun3x/its_been_a_year_since_i_started_living_solely_off/,

(added: being discussed in TIGSource. thank you /r/indiegaming!)

(added: teamliquid has similar article, so it maybe more concise and read better than this for you.
i already wrote steam-related problem into /r/gaming)

http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=149943

ok, here's some pre-facts

- Game Rating Board - http://www.grb.or.kr / Warning: Korean Characters

Acts like ESRB in U.S. but created by government. don't have publisher corporation members.
BUREAUCRATIC. And of course they got fee - for long-time-consuming-blah-blah-process.

- Publishing games without rating is illegal in Korea, with FEW exception.

(added: Only made public to on-line, no packaging - is still considered ""publishing"" in GRB.
Found that ESRB rating is in most case, required for money-making.
sorry for poor select of my words)

I heard that ESRB rating is OPTIONAL...

- Some indie game devs use RPG Maker. these devs are using forum to share their games, knowledge... etc.
- I can safely say, almost all of these games were all freebies, and not made intended to be commercial.

here's recent facts, or troublesome situation...

- September 1 (GMT +9) some of devs' forums got contact from GRB. like...

- ""Get your all games rated or cease posting games. Publishing unrated games are illegal. blah blah...""

- Coudn't afford the fee, forum's moderators forced to delete all of games listed in the board.

oh then how much does that cost?

I looked up $$$ damn rating process fee table for 2010.
original table is using korean WON but I should write US $ with, for your convenience.
and GRB have plan for raising these fees every year...
I'll use approx. 1175 won / 1$ today.

These indie-games got open-market, ""individually made"" category.
ah open-market game apps - GRB's making trouble here, but that's for another post,
not for /r/indiegaming.

here we go.

Basic fee per game:

- less than 10MB - 21000 won, 17.5$
- 10MB to 100MB - 50000 won, 23.8$
- 100MB to 300MB - 56000 won, 47.5$
- more than 300MB - 168000 wom, 142.97$

AND Coefficients... (This was somewhat difficult vocalbulary for me XD)

- Network related - x1.5
- Not network related - x1.0

AND Coefficients again per genres

- Role playing games - x3.0
- Betting-related, fighting, adventure, simulation, FPS - x2.0
- Puzzle, board, sports - x1.5
- Educational - x1.0

AND Coefficients for localizing

- Non-korean localized x1.1
- Korean localized x1.0

So... someone made 105MB of single-role-playing games in Korean, for FREE.
he/she has to pay 23.8 * 1.0 * 3.0 * 1.0 = approx 71.4$

and he will think like - ""I just wanted to make games and
uploaded to some forums, for FREE!
but why am I charged? why am I treated like criminal?""

and I never heard that Audiosurf or Worlds of Goo got their ESRB rating first. never.
(edited: my sentence above is WRONG. thx cableshaft!)

here's another news post for this situation - don't click if you can't read Korean characters in your browser. not intended for non-Koreans.

I am one of the two Devs on **Space Pirates and Zombies** (S.P.A.Z)
www.spazgame.com

As pretty much a Mac noob, and with our Mac release imminent, I have not done any marketing or contacting of the press.  This was foolish on my part.  I feel like I have a thesis paper due and it is the night before and I just started writing, so...yeah.

I was hoping that Reddit could inject my brain with some info on how to best spend my efforts over the next few days to get the word out on the Mac release.  (I am thinking it will likely be Monday as long as compatibility testing goes well)

There are about 10 beta keys to spare for the press, but we could get more if push came to shove. 

SPAZ has done well on the PC, and there has always been a strong call from the Mac community for a port, which is now here.  I just need to get the word out.

Lets say the top 5 upvoted suggestions get free SPAZ Steam keys as well.  Currently these are PC keys, but they will convert to Mac when it is released since SPAZ will use SteamPlay.  I will also randomly assign 5 to the comments cuz that's how I roll :)

Last time (over a year ago) that I asked for marketing advice for SPAZ, and it was a huge help.  Here's the original post from the wayback machine for anyone interested:
http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/f8w2i/getting_ready_to_sell_my_indie_game_after_15/

Thanks for any advice.  


p.s. Questions about SPAZ or indie dev in general are also welcome.
For anyone who is interested in how SPAZ came to be, I wrote sort of a biography of the development that is at some times gut wrenching, but ends well:  here:
http://www.spacepiratesandzombies.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3152

Morning Edit:
Wow, lots of great advice, thanks everyone!  I am moving info to my marketing todo list now.  Please keep it coming.  I will reply to individual posts shortly as well.  As for the give away, I figure that I will do that around lets say 6:00pm Pacific time give or take today to give everyone a chance to enter.     

Ok, the list is tallied.  Now to assign some keys:
fatalblur 11
jonbost 8

1340678063.0,94,self.IndieGaming,vlwhn,Sold my first game this week and decided I should share my story so far.,,113,19,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/vlwhn/sold_my_first_game_this_week_and_decided_i_should/,"Part 1 (The History):
Let me tell you a little bit about the history of my game: Flack. About three months ago, I decided to create my very own platformer game. It started out with simple [physics and basic key binding tests](http://i.imgur.com/hSzuR.png). I then moved on to designing a system where the [player could jump tile to tile](http://i.imgur.com/5jjs9.png). At this point, I decided I should dedicated to completing this game with all sorts of fun features; on top of that, I had no intentions of selling it.

I soon began adding fun features such as interactive tiles, and enemies. At the same time, I was also working on a Level Maker Tool. Early screenshot: [v0.1](http://i.imgur.com/CRtma.png). With this tool, I was able to quickly whip up levels, and share them with the community. Then I got thinking: ""What if other people could share their own levels with each other?"". Days later, I started playing with the idea of selling Flack to the public, and I also began programming harder with this mindset.

At the start of summer, I put in the most effort and time into programming than I ever have. Development was productive, and failures were very rare. I spent many restless nights pouring my soul into designing new textures, music, code, etc. I was honestly having a blast working on Flack. I had more thoughts like: If I plan to sell this game, I need to start finishing up real soon!

A month later, I started polishing up Flack. This included adding features such as a [pain alerts system](http://i.imgur.com/IXgVs.png) and other small improvements to the [Level Maker Tool](http://i.imgur.com/5tKt8.png). When the polishing process had ended, I began working on video development for [the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns0O_Po_LOY&amp;feature=player_embedded). Now that the game was mostly finished, I had all sorts of emotions and concerns. ""Will people like this game?"", ""What if the game is total crap compared to 'x' game?"", ""What if I actually make good money?"".

Part 2 (The Lesson):
Then it hit me; my main goal for this game was not to make money, it was to finish a game that was fun and fully functional. With this in mind, I had a great amount of peace, and excitement. It was time to sell Flack.

About a week ago, I put my game on the desura.com market. To be honest, I was pretty nervous. I sat in front of my screen looking at the charts as if a child was waiting for Santa on Christmas Eve. A greedy thought came into my head: ""Where's the money?"" Remember, at this point, my original goal was not money, yet I was craving it like no ones business for no good reason. I kind of felt hurt that not that many people were interested in purchasing my game.

HOW FOOLISH OF ME! How could I let money get in the way of my goals?! I made a fun game, and that was all I ever coded for in the first place! I have great amounts of joy when I reflect on this.

Part 3 (The Update):
I must say, Flack is doing really well, and I'm receiving all sorts of positive feed back all the time. I'm currently working on designing new levels everyday (some people found the game too easy so I'm making difficult level packs for free haha). If you've read this far, THANK YOU FOR READING and I hope you are able to learn from my mistakes in the game of marketing.

[Greenlight is on](http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/). So let's keep the subreddit clean, the following rules are for testing purposes, if they don't work we will think of something else:

* **NO DIRECT LINKING TO PROJECTS please use /r/greenlightquality for that.**
* If you want to share your game to /r/indiegaming please use text posts, we want to promote discussion with the community and the developer(s). Use the tag [Greenlight] so people will see them easily

Like I said in a [previous discussion that the community didn't seem to like](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/wcc16/a_question_to_the_rindiegame_community_about/):

&gt;Use detailed descriptions, links and some kind of explanation of why we should love your game. This will keep spammers at bay and, I think, will help a deeper integration of developers with the community.

**Missle Commander** - this started out as a test to my particle generation code (it didn't use to come with GameMaker, you had to code your own); it turned out pretty awesome. From the name, it's a Missile Command clone.

**The Escape** - it's a dungeon/maze game. Try to escape the dungeon alive.

Also Dev AMA inside.,Blorfy,110,21,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/i6std/hi_indie_gaming_we_are_a_tiny_indie_company/,"(Note: Cross Post From Gaming)

Being an indie developer, spreading the word about our game (Space Pirates and Zombies) has been a real struggle.

We hope that you are willing to try our demo. It is a 100 meg download and gives about 90 minutes of gameplay. The Beta is on sale now and is funding further development.
As said in the title, we have sold 9000 units, but we need about 3x that to turn a profit after 23 months of out of pocket development.

Website: http://www.spacepiratesandzombies.com

There is a big shiny ""demo"" button on the home page. Please give it a try and tell your friends if you like the game.

There is a quirky 3 part review series below that gives a great description of the feel of playing SPAZ.
Part1: http://nightmaremode.net/2011/05/space-pirates-and-zombies-impressions-4688/ 
Part2: http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/space-pirates-and-zombies-impressions-part-ii-5060/ 
Part3: http://nightmaremode.net/2011/06/space-pirates-and-zombies-impressions-part-iii-6067/

I am one of the two devs on SPAZ, and I would be happy to answer any questions about indie development, or SPAZ.

We have some new rules in the sidebar. We'll love to have some input about them, do we miss something? To make this thing work we need you all to report content and downvote what you don't like. Remember, we love indie stuff here, so help the small guys too! Read/watch their content and talk about it. The world is much bigger than Kotaku, RPS, Indie Games and such.

Our indiegogo funding campaign is drawing to a close, and while we haven't met the goal we hoped for, the money we have raised will be very helpful and any more is even more so. You can check out our indiegogo campaign here:

We're also on Greenlight, if you'd like to give us a thumbs up! We're currently ranked #30 in the top 100 Greenlight games, so your help could help us get greenlit by next month! (Gasp!)

This game has been a gleam in our eyes for nearly 10 years, and last year we started making it reality. It's an amazing concept, and it's shaping up to be an amazing and fun experience, for both us and our potential players.

1341360017.0,73,self.IndieGaming,w0823,Could Pixel Art perhaps be a little too overused in indie games lately?,Pteraspidomorphi,133,60,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/w0823/could_pixel_art_perhaps_be_a_little_too_overused/,"I hate bad 3D. It has always been repulsive to me. This doesn't mean I require *realistic* 3D in order to be able to enjoy a game - Just a reasonable polygon density or, at least, textures that tastefully hide the lack of curves in the models (many games, especially from a certain period up to maybe 5 years ago, do this very well).

2D isn't so clear cut. Like many of you here, I grew up with early 2D games, such as those from the NES and SNES eras. In the 2D world, polygons are not an issue, since 2D sprites are solely defined (from a graphical standpoint) by the textures themselves. It's possible to build a graphically solid game even with low resolution textures, and many of my favorite games do this. One of the reasons I'm a big fan of Final Fantasy VII, which is, after a fashion, a controversial game (some love it, some despise it), is precisely because of the painted (and pixelated) backgrounds. I'm thankful they didn't try to do with 3D what they simply couldn't at the time.

I know there are several reasons why an indie developer may choose pixelated. Budget, for one. You don't have an artist in the project and you can't afford one. You can do pixels on your own, since they're not nearly as complex as painted art. Maybe nostalgy. Many indie games are themed after 90s mechanics that are no longer popular among big budget studios, but still result in fun and playable games. Developers use pixelated art, and music to match, in order to complete the retro illusion. Sometimes there are technological reasons (low resolution art is more lightweight). Sometimes you're just making an artistic statement. And surely there are other reasons that do not occur to me right now.

But you know what I like even better than a solid 2D game with nice pixel art? A solid 2D game with gorgeous high definition art. A few years ago I got deep into the indie game community as a player, in the wake of the release of such beautiful games as Aquaria or Braid. I think I can state with confidence that good 2D is my absolute favorite type of art. As a software engineer with an interest in game design, I feel a strong loyalty towards the community and I do my best to support it monetarily - with a preference to DRM-free games. I'm a heavy supporter of the humble bundle (and others) personally and among my friends, and am a little disappointed that, lately, a disproportionate amount of the games that are reaching me and that I hadn't played yet use pixel art.

Understand that I do not mean any offense towards all the redditors, subscribers of /r/indiegaming, who did develop or are currently developing pixelated games, and I'm looking forward to reading your views on the subject in this discussion. Pixel art will always have a place in my heart and in the indie gaming community. But my own view is that the retro style is becoming a little stale. I can't help but feel that a certain lack of confidence from the part of the development team is preventing them from taking the extra step and going with beautiful art and a more orchestral soundtrack. When a simpler art style is used so overwhelmingly more often, it tends to lose uniqueness. Your game no longer looks antique, it just looks old. Technology has evolved, and there is so much more we can do now. So why don't we?

**UPDATE:** My conclusions from what people are posting here:

1. Most of the developers among you have absolutely no confidence and are locked down to a narrow worldview.
2. Many of you didn't really read what was written in the main post, by commenters who arrived before you, or even the actual comment you are replying to. You replied to things that are tangentially related to what was written, ignored the definitions proposed by the post you were replying to, or changed the subject altogether.
3. Many of you have no respect for the opinion of others, unless it matches yours (and I'm not the only victim here). If I wanted /r/circlejerk I would have posted there. You do not understand the meaning of debate. And please stop mentioning the same 4 games over and over. I just read a comment that was previously made at least three times, by other users (or at least other accounts).

I really do not feel the need to be diplomatic about this, since few people here are even making an effort to keep an open mind. I'm leaving this community now; You keep doing things your way, I'll take my business elsewhere, and everyone is happy.

Preordering will get you into the beta, but I'd like to draw your attention to the middle option: 

Besides the sponsorship ""get your name in the game"" option, there's two other.

There's the normal edition, $10 now, $15 after beta is over, and then there's the special edition, $20 now, $25 after.

What's the difference you ask? 

**Special Edition bonus content:** Additional Kingdom building, extra challenge quests and a unique character class.

Looking at this one way, you can get an incomplete game at half the price. Or you're paying double for launch-day DLC.

This game won the Excellence in Design award at IGF, I am saddened that this scar has the potential of dividing the fanbase, causing who knows how many who would've bought the low-tier version to not get it at all, or pirate it so they can play the whole game. Not to mention the problems it may cause with the devs having to manage two versions of the game, or people who would want to upgrade.

Hopefully this isn't violating any rules...I did my best to check first.

I'm making on an PC FPS-roguelike-ish-thingy called Tower of Guns (trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjsCcJr1WuI) . 

I've been working on it for some time and still have awhile to go (it's about 25% complete) , but it recently GOT ACCEPTED TO THE INDIECADE FESTIVAL and is going to be shown off at their E3 Showcase (woooooo!!)!!

The IndieCade guys have offered me a pass to the Expo (double wooo!) and a some L.A. friends have offered me their couches, but I need a little help with the rest (travel, mostly). 

Disclaimer: They'll show the game with or without me..so that's not in jeopardy...and I've been careful with budgeting so development isn't in jeopardy either...but I would REALLY like to actually BE at E3 to talk to press and publishers and fully take advantage of this great opportunity.

So, if you think you'd be interested in an FPS Rogue-like-like-ish-thingy, then consider Pre-Ordering today to help me out. Last night I figured I'd need roughly about 190 Pre-Orders (at 5 bucks each) and I've managed about a 100 so far...so I'm down to only needing about 90 Pre-Orders and every single Pre-Order matters a ton. 

Also Pre-Ordering gets you access to the development builds, so you can play what I've got right now (it's short—and early--but shows off the mechanics). (Here's an LP er going through it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=C9IIvBR_S-Q)

If you're interested in helping me get to E3 so I can be there with my game then please head on over to www.TowerofGuns.com.

And thanks so much! I'm super grateful to any and everyone who decides to help :-)

Some people might be interested by the **1.3** in the meantime (**free, for pc and mac**):

http://mossmouth.com/forums/index.php?topic=2769.0 compiled/updated by fans with bugfixes.

&gt;This is an **unofficial multi-platform update of Spelunky**. 

&gt;Every effort has been made to preserve the gameplay of Spelunky in it's original form. However, some changes have been made to the source code to fix bugs or optimize for ease of use and development. 

&gt;This update was created by idyll with assistance from the Spelunky community. Spelunky is copyright Derek Yu and Mossmouth, LLC.

The official **1.1** version is here:

The current game we're working on is a 2D point and click adventure game, not a game well suited for VR, right?

I though so too, but my partner suggested this idea: It's a crazy old looking game, why not just put it on an old computer in an old room? We borrowed a friend's Rift and got down to development, and a few days later we've got a rough demo for the Rift.

It's so silly, and the Rift support is novelty at best, but I'm still finding it amusing! 

*Warning, if you haven't seen our game before, it covers, um... adult themes, there's no cursing, and it's mostly euphamistic, but this is probably not a kids game. Then again, they're not my kids, do what you want!*

Redditors have been outstanding in promoting and supporting Star Prospector and have provided us with some fantastic feedback on the game, much of which has resulted in us making some changes and adding some features to the game that will be included in our next update.  

As a thank you for all of the support we've received from Redditors and the Reddit community in launching Star Prospector, we want to offer an exclusive discount to Redditors this weekend on purchasing Star Prospector.  

Redditors can visit the Cryptstone website at http://www.cryptstone.com/ and select the   “Buy from Us (BMT Micro)”  link, and when making their purchase, enter the discount code  “REDDIT”  in the discount field to receive a 50% discount off the current $9.99 USD price of the game.  In addition you will be fully eligible to receive the free DLC that will be released at the end of next week that will add additional features and new game modes.

My name is Tim Keenan (username: MisfitsAttic), and I'm the main creator guy for AVNT. This weeks AMA will be with myself and my wife/art dept Holly Keenan (username: HollyKeenan). In the last 2 years we've started a [small indie studio](http://misfitsattic.blogspot.com/), started a family, put out a game on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/207650)/PC, [marketed it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ag7zdCZsAwE_dE1UOU4xZTB6SElQdFhCUHdmTFN6aGc&amp;single=true&amp;gid=1&amp;output=html) ourselves, [created a booth](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.454024631286047.99874.126694837352363&amp;type=3) in the PAX Prime [Indie Megabooth](http://indiemegabooth.com/), and soon plan to [kickstart](http://misfitsattic.blogspot.com/2012/08/kickstarting-virus-poll.html) to hopefully add networking/level editor to the game. Check out our [Misfits Attic Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/MisfitsAttic) for more on what we've been up to.

You can read about our [backgrounds here](http://misfitsattic.blogspot.com/p/who-we-are.html), but the gist of it is that I went into console game dev then worked at Dreamworks Animation ([IMDB credits](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1647933/)) for 8 years before quitting my job to make/finish AVNT. Holly worked at places like Phillips &amp; Yahoo as a graphic designer and now does interactive interfaces for touch screen devices. Holly still works full time. 

Next week we'll be doing the art &amp; animation in the game with both of us + [Travis](http://travisleekoller.carbonmade.com/) (my talented artist friend I met at Dreamworks) +  [Ryan](http://mourou.net/2012/07/01/demo-reel-2012/) (fresh out of school who did most of the games animations) 
Here's the rest of the Schedule, Thanks!

Schedule: 11:00 am PT (2:00 ET) each Wed of Oct.

* 10/3   [Tim &amp; Holly](http://misfitsattic.blogspot.com/p/who-we-are.html): General Q's, starting/running a game company, design, PAX booth, etc.

* 10/10 Tim &amp; Holly &amp; [Travis](http://travisleekoller.carbonmade.com/) &amp; [Ryan](http://mourou.net/2012/07/01/demo-reel-2012/): Art &amp; Animation
