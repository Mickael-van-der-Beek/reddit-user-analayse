Well your wait is over.  Thanks to [artsedge-y](http://www.reddit.com/user/artsedge-y), the person in charge of the digital learning program at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, all of us have the opportunity to be awesome redditors and contribute our skills to something amazing and maybe even get a prize for it.  Read below for artsedge-y's explanation.**

From the Kennedy Center:
Here’s the backstory: In May of 1971, musician Marvin Gaye released the album What’s Going On. A year later, he performed it at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. Since 2011, the Kennedy Center has lead a national conversation and celebration around this landmark work. In May 2012, we are bringing the concert home to the Concert Hall stage, along with the voices and reflections of people who have answered the question, ""What’s Going On…Now?""

At its core, the project asks people to think about Marvin’s “then” and our “now,” then reflect on the issues he explored on the album and respond through their own creative work. That work should capture and comment on themes of Marvin’s record: war, poverty, addiction, the issues of returning vets, personal truth... The full list—as well as details on the album tracks and much more—can be found here: http://whatsgoingonnow.org/think.

This project has been in the works across the country, in and out of schools, since January. Of all the work submitted, we are curating only the best onto our Web site at whatsgoingonnow.org. In addition to the Web site, we’ll be integrating the images, music and video work onto screens across the Kennedy Center during our celebration events May 1-4.  Here is a little more on that: http://whatsgoingonnow.org/about-project

We are excited to work with the redditors here in /r/picturechallenge to open this up in a new way. We’ve adapted the campaign a bit for to fit in with the community here.

Here’s how it works:

- Using the themes and songs on Marvin Gaye's album, submit a picture that you think truly represents the ""What's Going On...Now"" idea.

- The Challenge will follow most of the regular community guidelines for /r/PictureChallenge. (changes noted below)

- There will be 3 winners for this challenge.  Once these winners are chosen by the community, the photographers will be asked to formally submit their entry through the What’s Going On…Now Web site (go to Create, then click on Share for details).  By submitting it there, you are agreeing to abide by the guidelines and the Kennedy Center’s [legal stuff](http://whatsgoingonnow.org/resources/legal-stuff).  International submissions are allowed despite what this page says.

- Those 3 winners will get a copy of the [40th Anniversary Box Set](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V7XWEE/), as well as having their work shown at the Center in May.

Rule Changes:

- Given our K-12 audiences, we would prefer you to not submit content that would be considered NSFW.

- We are only using Flickr to hold our “final pool”—the submissions here can go anywhere

- Pictures can be taken at any time.  There will be no need to worry about [OCD] but please keep it to one submission for this week.

Many thanks for considering to participate. If you have any questions, we are happy to answer them!  Just send us the usual message [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPictureChallenge) and if need be, we can pass it onto atsedge-y.

As of now, the challenge will conclude on Sunday, April 8th unless an extension seems like a good idea.

We as mods are all very excited to be working with such a prestigious artistic organization.  I will never stop realizing that if it wasn't for all of you amazing photographers, this subreddit would be no where.

To add to this already great news, we have some fun stuff for our film photographers.  We will be adding a monthly challenge for film only!  Both challenges will run at the same time and you are welcome to submit to both.  These challenges will also benefit from sunnydelish's donation so get those rolls ready.

It seems more like people check out what the challenge is, see if they took any photos in the proper time frame that they like, then try to sell us on how it fits the theme.... Not buying it. There needs to be a component for rating how succinctly on-topic the photos are. 

For example this week in ""post-Apocalyptic"" if we see things like a plate of food, a crowded city street, a dog playing with a child or a close up of someone wearing a pair of sunglasses.... Throw them out! 

Also, now that we have a good number of winners on the board we should consider revamping the voting system. Crowd-sourcing for upvotes on photos posted and different times is a very flawed system. It seems that former winners and mods should be the ones doing the voting. If you win, you are inducted into the PictureChallenge executive board. It gives another incentive to win and levels the playing field.. Just no voting for your own submissions. Ties go to a group vote. 

**EDIT- If you agree speak up. Make your voice heard. There are a lot of upvotes here suggesting that many people agree but the only people saying anything are the people who disagree.**",,False,self,t5_2s6zd,True,,,True,t3_tco1w,http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/tco1w/there_are_waaaayyyy_to_many_off_topic_photos_in/,

Curveship has to say this about his choice of topic: 

&gt; This week's challenge asks us to brush up on our compositional chops by employing a classic strategy: take a picture where there's something of interest in the foreground, the middle ground, and the background, and where the photo is enhanced by the interplay between the three. Landscape photographers and anyone who's studied art are probably already nodding their heads, but if this idea is new to you, google will give you lots of tutorials. It's one of the oldest approaches to composition, and is designed to give a picture depth and to lead our eye through a story. This isn't the week for creamy bokeh that obliterates everything but the subject (pretty as that might be), or the week for just putting your subject against a background. Challenge yourself to work on three planes and see what you can come up with.

Please take a moment to review the rules listed below before submitting your entry:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, April 8th, or after Sunday, April 14th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Sunday, April 14th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. **This is a slight change to the rules. Due to time constraints at work I have to compile these posts early in the morning (like 4am early) so the submission deadline had to change.**

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#115: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

Think back over your time as a photographer and think about what has inspired you... when you're walking around with your camera, *something* clicks in your head and tells you to capture an image, and that's what this challenge is about; capturing an image that, as soon as you hear the shutter release, you know is going to be something special. 

The rules for this challenge are the same as prior challenges: 

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, December 17th, or after Sunday, December 23rd. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, December 24th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#100: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* The winner of this week's challenge won't be choosing a topic, but rather will be given a special custom flair signifying their win in this historic challenge. 

The winner of Challenge #98 has posted their challenge topic and that topic will be posted next week, at which time we'll get back to business as usual. 

And from all of us on the mod team, thank you... without you we'd be nothing but four people keeping watch over a barren, boring subreddit.

This week's challenge comes from the winner of Challenge #99, [bnej](http://www.flickr.com/photos/56280406@N04/8277531006/).  

Please take a moment to read through the challenge before making your submission:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, January 7th, or after Sunday, January 13th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, January 14th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#102: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic. 

Be creative, and most importantly...have fun!

To post an image for a challenge that links back to a site that allows someone to purchase your image isn't what we're about here.

* When you make your submission, please remember to put the challenge number before the post title (ie: #54: Light And Dark). This is necessary for the script that we use to compile the candidates post to find your challenge, and without that your entry won't be included in the post unless we happen to notice it or you send us a message. 

* When making your post, if you have an idea for the next challenge should you win, please post it in the comments. This will help us quickly get the next challenge posted after compiling the candidates post. If you don't have an idea or forget, it's no big deal but it will delay us in posting the next challenge, as we'll have to contact you should you win for your challenge idea.

This week's challenge comes from the winner of Challenge #97, [NJPalms](http://www.flickr.com/photos/durdahjp/8228358289/lightbox/).  

Please take a moment to read through the challenge before making your submission:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, December 10th, or after Sunday, December 16th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, December 17th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#99: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic. 

Be creative, and most importantly...have fun!

Please take a moment to read through the challenge before making your submission:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, October 22th, or after Sunday, October 28th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, October 29th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#93: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic. 

Be creative, and most importantly...have fun!

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, April 15th, or after Sunday, April 21st. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Sunday, April 21st. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. **This is a slight change to the rules. Due to time constraints at work I have to compile these posts early in the morning (like 4am early) so the submission deadline had to change.**

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#116: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Wednesday, June 12th, or after Tuesday, June 18th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Tuesday, June 18th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#125: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions.

When I asked RyanoRhino to elaborate on his topic, he had this to say: 

&gt;The idea is to use any form of engineering as a subject, be it a building, a vehicle, even a monument/statue. Once some form of engineering has gone into it.

&gt;The other side is to photograph engineering in process, flawed engineering, or any way you can tie in engineering. Even a lack of engineering would be a cool idea, if you can get creative. Just tie engineering into it, and make engineering the inspiration for your shot.

I can understand that some people are put off by the fact that point-and-shoot users aren't able to actually ""free-lens"", or that some people don't want to risk their gear shooting this way. That's fine. 

However, if you look at our list of challenges since this subreddit started, you could find a reason in each of them that someone wouldn't be able to participate. A few months ago the challenge idea was ""F/8 And Be There"" and it had a large number of submissions, even though a large number of entry-level point-and-shoot cameras lack a function for adjusting the aperture, for example. 

This subreddit is about challenging yourself as a photographer and taking the best shot you can with the gear you have available. Just because you can't take the lens off of your camera doesn't mean you can't participate... with some reading on the effects that free-lensing produces you could reproduce the effect with a point-and-shoot and some work in Photoshop. The first submission for this challenge, for example, was taken with a point-and-shoot camera. 

In the future, if a topic comes around that you can't participate in, just remember that the next week another challenge will be coming around; participating in our challenges isn't about the little Flair number next to your name; it's about interpreting the challenge in your own way and challenging yourself to produce a shot that follows your interpretation.

This challenge will stand, and in the future we're going to continue to follow the same guidelines about the winners choosing challenge ideas that we have in the past; it's really up to you guys to choose the topic.",,False,self,t5_2s6zd,1343766178.0,,plane,True,t3_xgtl2,http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/xgtl2/this_weeks_challenge/,moderator

After much deliberation and debating, we have come to the conclusion that OCD posts will no longer be allowed.  When this subreddit was still in its first few weeks, I created OCD posts to increase the number of weekly submissions when our number of subscribers was small.  It allowed for more submissions when each week we were seeing at most 3-5 pictures.  Now that this subreddit has grown to almost 5,500 people with around 20 submissions a week, it's time to make the karma a little harder to get.  The reason I started this subreddit was to give people a reason to pick up their camera and shoot some new pictures every once and a while.  My hope is that with OCD gone, people will be even more likely to go out and shoot a new picture rather than just finding an old shot and posting it for karma or views.  Let's try and make 30 submissions a week a normal occurrence.

Please bear with us while we get all of the rules sorted out.  Here are some big changes though to get you started (after about a week, please let us know if you see any problems with the rules):

* Pictures *must* be posted to the websites listed in the sidebar, no exceptions.  Pictures on other websites will be removed.

* Pictures that are what was once defined as OCD will be removed unless you have special permission from the mods to post it.

* This will take effect at the start of challenge #76.

Feel free to message us at #picturechallenge if you have any questions or concerns.",,False,self,t5_2s6zd,False,,camera,True,t3_v40a6,http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/v40a6/the_abolition_of_ocd_for_rpicturechallenge/,moderator

I explained  that this kind of post went contrary to what we were trying to do here and, after some discussion with my fellow Moderators, we agreed that these types of posts shouldn't be allowed. 

Some people have pointed out that many photo hosting sites have options to allow people to license and purchase their work, but the difference is when we post from those sites we aren't posting the image directly from the purchase section of the website. 

[This is a screenshot of the post in question that I deleted](http://i.imgur.com/94Duj.jpg). I've removed the submitter's name and also blackened out the file number, but this submission was directly from the iStockPhoto purchase page and that's where my issue arose. 

I hope this clarifies my thought process and reasons for deleting it. Honestly, if someone had posted a submission from Flickr or any other approved website that was directly from the purchase page, I'd have done the same thing. It wasn't the site that prompted the deletion, but the intention of the post.

I'm not for a minute saying that the submitter did anything wrong... he hasn't been banned from the subreddit and he's more than welcome to continue to participate. We just didn't feel that a link from a purchase page of an image was in the spirit of what we're doing here. 

If anyone has questions or wants to discuss this further, here's the place to do it. :)

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, January 21st, or after Sunday, January 27th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, January 28th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#104: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

Last night, I was one of two people in a convenience store that was taken over by an armed robber.  His intent was not really to rob the store, but to get in a shootout with police.  He demanded money from the register, then waited for police to arrive.  After a 20 minute standoff with 15 or so cops, he finally decided to surrender.

[And I don't think this challenge would be complete without this video being in the challenge post.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x11lvw_thomas-dolby-she-blinded-me-with-sc_music#.UUd_PBz9Z4Q) Sorry for the Daily Motion link, but EMI blocked the video on YouTube. 

Please take a moment to review the rules listed below before submitting your entry:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, March 18th, or after Sunday, March 24th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Sunday, March 24th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. **This is a slight change to the rules. Due to time constraints at work I have to compile these posts early in the morning (like 4am early) so the submission deadline had to change.**

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#112: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

1332258182.0,19,self.PictureChallenge,r56px,Improperly labeled OCD submissions,admiraljohn,20,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/r56px/improperly_labeled_ocd_submissions/,"Several people had expressed concerns over some submissions that aren't labeled as ""Outside Challenge Dates"" submissions and asking what kind of verification we undertake, so I thought I'd offer some clarification.

We don't verify every submission to ensure the date range is correct for the challenge... the only post I specifically verify is the winning submission. When choosing the winner I'll verify that the picture was taken within the challenge dates and, assuming it is, either contact the winner and ask for their challenge or, if the submitter indicated the challenge in their post, will base it from that.

I don't think I've ever had an instance where the winning submission turned out to fall outside the challenge dates, but were that to happen I would simply move to the second highest upvoted submission and go from there.

With that in mind, I would ask that everyone double-check their submissions to ensure they are being taken within the challenge dates; I think the instances people are seeing of submissions not being labeled OCD were done in error and not out of an intent to defraud our little community. 

In the future if you have concerns about an improperly labeled submission, the best way to handle it is via messaging the mods. We'll address it privately with the submitter and, if necessary, delete the post so they can resubmit it with a proper label. Calling a user out publicly isn't appropriate and such posts are subject to being deleted.

If you have any questions or concerns, either voice them here, shoot me a PM or shoot us a ModMail and we'll do our best to answer your questions. :)",,False,self,t5_2s6zd,True,,plane,True,t3_r56px,http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/r56px/improperly_labeled_ocd_submissions/,moderator

Please take a moment to review the guidelines listed below:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Wednesday, July 24th, or after Tuesday, July 30th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Tuesday, July 30th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#130: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

Please take a moment to read through the challenge before making your submission:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, August 27th, or after Sunday, September 2nd.

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#85: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Please note that we are no longer allowing submissions that were taken outside of the challenge dates (OCD). Any posts made that weren't taken within the challenge timeframe for this week will be removed. Don't make us be mean. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

Beginning with this week's challenge (""Shadows""), rather than post your OCD shots as their own separate submission, post links to your OCD shots as a comment in Challenge thread. This will enable you guys to share your OCD shots while keeping the front page of our happy little subreddit a bit more organized. 

This also means that next week's candidate post will only list the ""regular"" shots; we won't be compiling a list of OCD shots, as they'll all be right here, but this also means that you're not limited to one OCD submission.

    * If you think a post is inappropriate for this subreddit (*not* you think that it doesn't fit the theme/challenge) then hit the report button and we will deal with it.
* If your photo was taken outside the challenge dates, please add ""[OCD]"" to your title.

* If you are submitting a picture that you want to be eligible to win, you *must* upload it to one of the sites listed on the sidebar in the FAQ.

* Please be constructive with your comments on this subreddit.  Constructive criticism and advice is welcomed, being rude and insulting is not.  

* Please make the effort to submit a non-OCD picture.  The point of these challenges when we started was to give people incentive to go out and shoot pictures.  If you have a picture that you absolutely must submit that's OCD, we understand, that's why we have the OCD.

*Please include the movement you're trying to recreate in your title! 
e.g. #131: Title (movement)*

*Have fun!*""

Please take a moment to review the guidelines listed below:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Wednesday, July 31th, or after Tuesday, August 6th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Tuesday, August 6th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#131: picture title (movement)"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

Please take a moment to read through the challenge before making your submission:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, August 6th, or after Sunday, August 12th.

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#82: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Please note that we are no longer allowing submissions that were taken outside of the challenge dates (OCD). Any posts made that weren't taken within the challenge timeframe for this week will be removed. Don't make us be mean. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

Your comments and behavior have been deemed both provocative and destructive by the moderation team (collectively) of this subreddit. Since this is not the first incident, your account (and hence forward any account we consider to be yours) will be banned on sight, effective immediately. This decision was not made lightly, however, we feel this action is in the best interest of both the viewers and the mod team of this subreddit. Your wins have been stripped and both the user flair and our records should update soon.

We wish the best of luck in your photography adventures.

**PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGE TO OCD SUBMISSIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE WITH THIS CHALLENGE.**

To quote the character of Jack Horner in Boogie Nights, ""There's shadows in life, baby."" 

Please take a look at the sidebar and the points below before submitting.

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. If you picture is OCD, you don't have to worry about this rule.

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, June 11th, or after Sunday, June 17th.

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#75: picture title"". Please note if you edited the picture. We also would love to know any descriptions and metadata.

* After some debate among the mods and listening to what everyone here has to say, we're going to try something different with OCD submissions. Rather than post your OCD shots as their own separate submission, post links to your OCD shots as a comment in this thread. This will enable you guys to share your OCD shots while keeping the front page of our happy little subreddit a bit more organized. This also means that next week's candidate post will only list the ""regular"" shots; we won't be compiling a list of OCD shots, as they'll all be right here, but this also means that you're not limited to one OCD submission.

**Do not downvote submissions. If there is a submission you feel is inappropriate (non-tagged ocd, posted in wrong subreddit, etc.), please report it to a mod and it will be considered for removal.**

If you have any questions, let one of us know.

Please take a moment to review the guidelines listed below:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Wednesday, August 7th, or after Tuesday, August 13th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Tuesday, August 13th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#132: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

Please take a moment to read through the challenge and [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/picturechallenge/about/sidebar) before making your submission:

* **Please note that we have removed 500px.com from our approved hosting websites.  The site does not allow us to check the exif data to see when the photo was taken.**

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, December 24th, or after Sunday, December 30th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, December 31st. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#101: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

**Please take a look at the sidebar and the points below before submitting**

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, or playlookit.com for the time being so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules.  If you picture is OCD, you don't have to worry about this rule.

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday October 10th or after Sunday October 16th (makes it a little more of a challenge).  If they are out of the time frame, please add [OCD] (Outside Challenge Dates) to the title.  *Note*: [OCD] pictures are not eligible to win

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#43: *picture title*""

* Please note if you edited the picture.  We also would love to know any descriptions and metadata

* This challenge will conclude Sunday, October 16th

* Please only post one picture for the challenge.  If you have others that you would like to share, post them to our brother subreddit, [/r/ITookAPicture](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture).

He had this to say about his challenge topic: 

&gt;A vanishing point is the intersection where parallel lines appear to converge in the distance. These can be actual lines, [like this](http://www.thecoolist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/vanishing-point-photography_3.jpg), or implied lines like the ones that could be drawn between all the tips and all the stumps of [these trees](http://images.betterphoto.com/0751/0712220611551image0000.jpg). A photo that utilizes one or more vanishing points creates a sense of perspective using (typically straight) lines that extend away from the camera. I hope I've explained this reasonably well.

Please take a moment to review the rules listed below before submitting your entry:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, February 25th, or after Sunday, March 3rd. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions that combine two separate images into one unique submission are allowable if both pictures making up the submission were taken in the challenge period. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, March 4th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#108: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

I totally love this subreddit, it has gone from a new entry in my reddit quiver, to the number one subreddit and a really fun catalyst for my photography. I especially love the consistently high quality of the pictures entered here, at least half of the entries every week impress the shit out of me, the soon to be winner of last weeks 'Peak' contest just blows me away (and from the last few weeks, 'The lack of it', 'Light of another world', 'End of the road', 'Power through Nature' and 'Parking structure wall' are all just wonderful pictures). 

**HOWEVER**, there is something rotten in the state of picturechallenge. One of the rules is no downvotes, and while I am willing to believe that the minus votes on some entries are just the reddit vote algorithm playing around with votes to dissuade something or other, this week we even have entries at zero, which I don't think the algorithm can even do. So people do downvote. The reddit algorithm can't be showing over 50% downvotes, it shows a fluctuation of one or two votes, not 10 plus...

Personally, I think we should allow downvotes, people seem to be doing it already, and I think we have a simple problem here. If we disallow downvotes, people still downvote, but they know it's wrong so it's ""Silent"". 

If we allow downvotes, people would downvote but as it's OK, we could expect criticism about pictures. 

&gt;*I think your focus is way off* 

&gt;*I hate selective colouring*

&gt;*Your lens cap is still on*

At the moment, nobody would ever offer real criticism, because almost every single entry has some downvotes, and if they offer some constructive criticism then everyone would immediately think that person was responsible for some downvoting, so nobody ever criticises the pictures. So instead we get downvotes without the benefit of knowing why. I would LOVE to get some feedback on the pictures. 

I am sorry if this is something that has been talked about before, but it's annoying me that everyone pretends nobody here is downvoting, when it's blatantly obvious with some of the '0' upvote entries that there are real downvotes here.

1348487139.0,16,self.PictureChallenge,10dzer,Challenge #89: Anachronism ,admiraljohn,21,5,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/10dzer/challenge_89_anachronism/,"This week's challenge comes from the winner of Challenge #87, [webmonk](http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/zow2b/87_see_what_you_want_to_see/).  

And just in case anyone was wondering, here's what Wikipedia has to say about what ""Anachronism"" means: 

&gt; An anachronism is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of person(s), events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. 

Please take a moment to read through the challenge before making your submission:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, September 24th, or after Sunday, September 30th.

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, September 30. Posts made after this time may not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#89: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Please note that we are no longer allowing submissions that were taken outside of the challenge dates (OCD). Any posts made that weren't taken within the challenge timeframe for this week will be removed. Don't make us be mean. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic. 

Be creative, and most importantly...have fun!

The surprise is still to come, but it was held up by DC lawyers (yes, it is that awesome).  Because of last minute changes, this challenge got posted very late.  To make up for this, this challenge is a free for all.  That means we don't care one bit about [OCD].  Post pictures from whenever and every submission is eligible to win.

This challenge comes to you from the [winner](http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/r297y/63_withered/) of challenge #63: [ShaneRounce](http://www.reddit.com/user/ShaneRounce).

**Please take a look at the sidebar and the points below before submitting**

* ~~Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, playlookit.com, or 500px.com for the time being so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules.  If you picture is OCD, you don't have to worry about this rule.~~

* ~~Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday January 2nd or after Sunday January 8th (makes it a little more of a challenge).  If they are out of the time frame, please add [OCD] (Outside Challenge Dates) to the title.  *Note*: [OCD] pictures are not eligible to win~~

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#65: *picture title*""

* Please note if you edited the picture.  We also would love to know any descriptions and metadata

* This challenge will conclude Sunday, April 1st

* Please only post one picture for the challenge.  If you have others that you would like to share, post them to our brother subreddit, [/r/ITookAPicture](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture).

When I asked him for a bit of clarification as to what he meant, he had this response for us: 

&gt; Whe he was asked how he got such incredible images on a very consistent basis, photojournalist Arthur Fellig, better known as “Weegee,” said, “Simple. f/8 and be there.” That statement has become the mantra of street and documentary photographers since he uttered it. It has been interpreted as referring to several technical elements of photography: zone focusing, a lens often being its sharpest at f/8, etc. But it also includes a heavy philosophical bent, and that’s what I’d like this challenge to focus on. Think of this as a documentary challenge, keeping in mind what Weegee really meant: shoot what is interesting, tell a story, be the silent observer. 

Bear in mind this doesn't mean that your submissions HAVE to be shot at f/8... it's more about the philosophy of Weegee's statement than following the ""technical"" requirements mentioned. 

Please take a look at the sidebar and the points below before submitting.

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. If you picture is OCD, you don't have to worry about this rule.

* In order to be eligible for the competition, pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, January 30th, or after Sunday, February 5th (makes it a little more of a challenge). If they are out of the time frame, please add [OCD] (Outside Challenge Dates) to the title. Note: [OCD] pictures are not eligible to win

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#57: picture title""

* Please note if you edited the picture. We also would love to know any descriptions and metadata

* This challenge will conclude Sunday, February 5th.
* Please only post one picture for the challenge. If you have others that you would like to share, post them to our brother subreddit, /r/ITookAPicture.

* The ""one picture"" does not apply to OCD submissions; you can submit more than one OCD submission, and if you've submitted an entry to be considered for the challenge you can still post an OCD submission.

This weeks challenge was chosen by the winner of Challenge #131, [MrRandomQuestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/1jhnuh/131_modern_day_eclecticism/). 

Please take a moment to review the guidelines listed below:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Wednesday, August 13th, or after Tuesday, August 20th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Tuesday, August 20th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#133: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.

As much as I would like to make photography a way to make a living, I still have to work a real job, which means I rarely get a chance to shoot much during the week.  Since I can't shoot until the weekend, I usually don't have time to proof, edit, upload, etc. until very late on the weekend or into the next week.  Since the challenges run from Monday until Sunday, and I normally can't shoot until Saturday, it is rare that I will have anything ready by Sunday evening, and by the time I get ready to upload on Monday at work, the submissions have already been closed and the new challenge is often posted.  I have some pictures that would fit very nicely with this week's theme, but I took them on Sat., outside of the submission guidelines.

I know I can't be the only person with this type of timing issue.  I know it would help me, and I am assuming quite a few others if the challenge dates were changed around a little.  For instance, instead of running Mon. to Sun., if we run from Sat. to Fri. it would give people more time to shoot, edit, and upload.  I know this sounds like I am making excuses for not submitting (and to be honest, yes, I am), but I think changing the timing could help others as well as myself.  It could potentially raise our number of submissions, and our subscribers to the subreddit.

Thoughts?

Suggestions?

This week's challenge comes from the winner of Challenge #93, [vtbeavens](http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/125eh0/93_parking_structure_wall/).  

Please take a moment to read through the challenge before making your submission:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, November 5th, or after Sunday, November 11th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 7:30am EST on Monday, November 12th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#95: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Given the nature of this challenge, if your submission has the potential to be disturbing, please label it NSFW. 

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic. 

Be creative, and most importantly...have fun!

Hummingbirds don't sit still long, so rather than chasing them around sometimes I find it easier to sit and wait manual focused on one spot in the Lantana bush.  As an aside, I'm thinking of giving up the 70-200mm for the 200mm f/2.8 prime, anyone have experience with the prime (on an APS-C sensor body) ?",,False,self,t5_2s6zd,True,,,True,t3_jmbzx,http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/jmbzx/36_she_loves_these_flowers/,

Please take a moment to review the guidelines listed below:

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, July 8th, or after Sunday, July 14th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Sunday, July 14th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#128: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions.

* Pictures must be submitted from Flickr, Picasa, min.us, smugmug, 500px.com, deviantart.com, Google Plus or playlookit.com so the mods can confirm that the picture is in compliance with the rules. There's been an increase in the past several weeks of people submitting to unapproved hosts, so please verify you're using one of these before submitting. Submissions made to other hosts will be removed. 

* Whichever site you choose to host your pictures, please make sure you've chosen to allow people to view the EXIF data for your picture so we can verify the date. Any submissions without this available are subject to being removed. 

* Pictures are not to have been taken prior to Monday, June 3rd, or after Tuesday, June 11th. Submissions that were not taken between those dates will be removed. 

* Submissions should be posted by 11:59pm EST on Tuesday, June 11th. Posts made after this time will not be included in the Candidate's Post. 

* Post your pictures as links with the title ""#124: picture title"". If the submission doesn't follow this format the script that we use to compile the Candidate's Post won't include it. 

* Do not upvote your own submissions from alternate accounts. That goes totally against the spirit of what this subreddit is about. 

* Do not downvote submissions. If you have a criticism to offer about a picture, post a comment about why you think the submission doesn't work, and do so respectfully.  

* **Please post your challenge topic as a comment in your submission.** This will enable us to quickly post the next challenge once we've determined the winning submissions. Failure to do this, or to respond in a timely manner when asked for your challenge, may result in forfeiture of your chance to choose a challenge topic.
