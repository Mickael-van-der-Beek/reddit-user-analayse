I also included episodes which are not on Netflix at the bottom.

* South Park - [Scott Tenorman Must Die](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70116463&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=South+Park%3A+Ssn+5%3A+Scott+Tenorman+Must+Die)

* Scrubs - [My Screw Up](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70160120&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Scrubs%3A+Ssn+3%3A+My+Screw+Up)
* Firefly - [Out of Gas](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70133877&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Firefly%3A+Complete+Series%3A+Out+of+Gas)
* Doctor Who - [Blink](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70110262&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Doctor+Who%3A+Ssn+3%3A+Blink)

The payoff from this show comes with the build up, watching this episode on its own with out having seen the rest of the series will not make sense.
* Futurama - [Jurassic Bark](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70140751&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Futurama%3A+Vol.+4%3A+Jurassic+Bark)

AND [Eye of the Beholder](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70174047&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Twilight+Zone%3A+Ssn+2%3A+Eye+of+the+Beholder)
* Lost - [The Constant](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70122845&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Lost%3A+Ssn+4%3A+The+Constant) - This is another episode that you should not watch without the context.
* Blackadder - [Goode Bye](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70129541&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Black+Adder%3A+4%3A+Goode+Bye)
* Sherlock - [A Study in Pink](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70174779&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Sherlock%3A+Series+1%3A+A+Study+in+Pink)

* Breaking Bad - [Crawl Space](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70236045&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Breaking+Bad%3A+Ssn+4%3A+Crawl+Space) - Specifically the last 10 minutes are mentioned in the thread.
* Avatar: The Last Airbender - [Sozin's Comet](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70136345&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Avatar%3A+Book+3%3A+Sozin%27s+Comet) - This is a cartoon, but like many anime shows it is pretty serial. This is the series finale and if you've never seen the show, look two down on this list.
* Futurama - [Luck of the Fryish](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70140728&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Futurama%3A+Vol.+3%3A+The+Luck+of+the+Fryrish)
* Avatar: The Last Airbender - [Tales of Bang Sing Se](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70136326&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Avatar%3A+Book+2%3A+Tales+of+Ba+Sing+Se) - This is a bunch of short stories and is a good intro if you've never seen the show.
* Buffy the Vampire Slayer - [The Body](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70133821&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Buffy%3A+Ssn+5%3A+The+Body) - This episode is contains a big spoiler as the premise of the episode, it also makes more sense when you understand the alternate realities going on. If you've never watched the show just start at season 2.
* Firefly - [Objects in Space](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70133881&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Firefly%3A+Complete+Series%3A+Objects+in+Space) - This is the unintended series finale of the show and it does contain some spoilers for other parts. It should be viewed last.
* Scrubs - [My Lunch](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70160173&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Scrubs%3A+Ssn+5%3A+My+Lunch)
* Doctor Who - [The Doctor Dances](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70072152&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Doctor+Who%3A+Ssn+1%3A+The+Doctor+Dances) - The second part of a two parter that starts with [The Empty Child](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70072151&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Doctor+Who%3A+Ssn+1%3A+The+Empty+Child)
* Futurama - [The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70140762&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Futurama%3A+Vol.+4%3A+The+Devil%27s+Hands+Are...)

* Futurama - [Roswell That Ends Well](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70140742&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Futurama%3A+Vol.+3%3A+Roswell+That+Ends+Well)

* The Office - [The Dinner Party](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70108695&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=The+Office%3A+Ssn+4%3A+Dinner+Party)

* The Chappelle Show - [Episode 4](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70138028&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Chappelle%27s+Show%3A+Season+2%3A+Episode+4)
* South Park - [Woodland Critter Christmas](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70116522&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=South+Park%3A+Ssn+8%3A+Woodland+Critter...)

* Lost - [Through the Looking Glass Part 1](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70122839&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Lost%3A+Ssn+3%3A+Through+the+Looking...+Part+1)
* Battlestar Galactica - [Exodus: Part 2](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152371&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Battlestar%3A+Ssn+3%3A+Exodus+Pt+2) - Don't watch this without wathing the rest of the series. If you haven't watched it yet, you should just go do that.
* Battlestar Galactiva - [33](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152335&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Battlestar%3A+Ssn+1%3A+33) - This is the first non-miniseries episode of the series. If you want to watch this episode alone, it would work, but I would just recommend that you start with the mini-series.
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia - [The Nightman Cometh](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70224529&amp;trkid=3325854&amp;t=Always+Sunny%3A+Ssn+4%3A+The+Nightman+Cometh)

What's here today is gone tomorrow.  Don't let that stop you from adding films on this thread though.  Browsing Netflix isn't a simple task but having a title in hand helps.  

Also, I shouldn't have used the term Blockbusters when talking about some of these.  I'm amongst enough videophiles that I should be more specific.

If you haven't watched it yet, stop what you're doing and get to it, now.

* **Doctor Who** (reboot) - When the main character can travel through time and space, there are literally infinite story possibilities.  This show is an amazing combination of science fiction, character development, and story line.  Watch it and become a Whovian like the rest of us.  (And once you're done, check out **Torchwood**, a DW spin-off, also very good)

* **Mad Men** - The ultimate retro show that follows the life of Don Draper, a high powered and talented ad-man in NYC in the 1960s.  Drama, drinks, smokes, and beautiful people dressed to the 9s, Mad Men is a portal into a different era.

* **Luther** - John Luther is a brilliant homicide detective with more than his fair share of extra-curricular problems.  Unlike many other shows/films that fall into the cop genre, in Luther we know very early on who the killer is, which often leads to awesome cat and mouse games.  Oh and, Alice Morgan (played by Ruth Wilson) is simply amazing.  One season only, however with some googling you can easily find season two around the intertubes.

* **Jekyll** - Dr. Tom Jackman lived a relatively normal life for nearly 40 years.  He gets married in his late 30s, has twins, and is living a happy life, when all of a sudden he starts blacking out for long periods of time, waking up covered in blood or with a prostitute, not knowing what happened.  ""Jekyll"" offers superb acting by James Nesbitt, and an incredibly awesome take on an old tale.  Steven Mofatt wrote it, you should watch it.  Sadly there's only one season (although technically there still could be more in the future, but I doubt it).

* **Downton Abbey** - This generation's ""Upstairs/Downstairs"", if you know what that is.  The plot follows the lives of both the English aristocrats of Downton Abbey who are struggling to find an appropriate heir to the title and massive castle/manor that is Downton, but also the servants who run the joint.  Set in roughly 1912-1914 (for the first season, next season is out in about 4 months), it offers some very intriguing story lines and fun look at the ridiculousness of the British aristocracy (and those who served them).  

* **Sherlock** - Steven Moffat does it again (seriously, Moffat is *amazing*).  A fresh take on an old tale again, Sherlock is a modern day take on Sherlock &amp; Dr. Watson, as they tear through London tracking down clever and deadly killers.  One season (3 episodes) for now, but season 2 will be coming within the next few months.

* **Firefly** - Shut up and watch it.  And then watch Serenity.  And then watch it all again.  

* **30 Rock** - Not sure that this needs any introduction.  Simply put, it's freakin' hilarious.

* **Parks &amp; Recreation** - Although Parks &amp; Rec. probably has a few less followers than 30 Rock, it really shouldn't.  If you like 30 Rock though, you're guaranteed to like Parks &amp; Rec.  Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) and Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) are two of the funniest characters on TV right now.

* **The Tudors** - A wonderful costume drama about the court of Henry VIII, which was of course, an extremely turbulent time.  Whether it's the question of religion, foreign war, or the birth of a male heir, The Tudors is a fun and sexy look at the royal court during the Reformation.  History buffs especially--it's a blast (and fairly accurate). 


* **The League** - This show was one of the best surprises of the past year as it is LOLLLL level of funny.  It's essentially about five 35 year old friends and their fantasy football league (and other exploits).  It's simple but hilarious.  Even if you don't do fantasy sports it's hilarious, but if you do, then you'll be in love.

* **Spartacus Blood &amp; Sand** - This is the greatest porn with a story line you'll ever see!  But really, there's a lot of sex and violence, with a dash of old-school Roman treachery and scheming.  It's a serious guilty pleasure.  Unfortunately the lead actor relapsed with cancer between season 1 &amp; 2, so season 2 was re-written late and isn't quite as good as 1, but still worth the watch.

* **Top Gear (UK)** - You don't need to be a car person to enjoy Top Gear, although it obviously helps.  Really though, what makes this show incredibly entertaining is the relationship between the three hosts, who are all middle-aged Brits who are very different from each other.  Almost every episode they are given some whacky challenge (like taking a car and giving it the capability to float the English Channel to France, which they do) and the banter between the three of them is great to watch.  

* **Party Down** - A hilarious gem that follows wanna-be actors in LA working as caterers trying to make ends meet.  Not quite as good as Arrested Development, but it's not a stretch imo to say that it's only a tier below.  

* **Pushing Daisies** - It's rather difficult to describe Pushing Daisies, and that's probably a very good thing.  It's part fantasy, part romance, part detective, part...well, hell, I don't know.  But it's fun and as charming as any show on television.  

* **Dead Like Me** - George and her gang of colleagues are all dead, but they have a job to do; they have to release peoples' souls (by touching them) right after they die, which is why they refer to themselves as ""reapers"".  Of course, this makes for some completely ridiculous and morbidly awesome dark comedy.  It's tough not to fall in love with all of the characters.  Just don't watch the movie!

* **Better Off Ted** - Similar in many ways (although not quite as in-depth) to Arrested Development, Better Off Ted was another missed gem about Ted and his colleagues in the R&amp;D department of a completely ridiculous conglomerate corporation happy to sell virtually anything.

* **MI-5** - As smart as they come for spy thriller shows.   I haven't seen every season, so I can't comment on them all, but seasons 1-5 are all edge-of-your-seat smart action.

* **Any Human Heart** - It's tough to describe this short Masterpiece Classic show, so I'll just leave it to Netflix: ""Riding the waves of the 20th century to two continents, Logan Mountstuart tries his hand at writing, the art trade and espionage, brushing shoulders along the way with a stunning assortment of iconic personalities"".  Has some flaws for sure, but it's worth the watch.

That should be enough for now then hopefully.  Please add any more suggestions in the comments!

It has all of Netflix's current streaming movies that can be searched and separated by genre, rating, date added, year released, etc.  You can even search by NYT critic's choice and rotten tomatoes score. Extra points because you can click a genre like comedy THEN click NYT critic's choice to see what the best comedies are. If you click on the movie it will also suggest similar streaming movies.

If you don't know what you want to watch but don't feel like flipping through the same 100 movies netflix puts on their search screen, it makes life a hell of a lot easier.

I have been planning to watch this show for ages, and finally got started yesterday. It's hilarious. I watched all of the first series last night . . . I just couldn't stop watching. 

I noticed that the first series is set to expire on March 30, and I immediately thought about how much I would have hated missing this show because I didn't realize it was expiring. I have no idea why it will expire but the other series won't. Series 4 is set to expire in June of this year, but 2 and 3 aren't set to expire until next year. Weird. 

At any rate, I can't say enough good things about this show. Watch it.

**Misery (1990)**

Director: Rob Reiner (This is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men)

Starring: James Caan (Elf, The Godfather), Kathy Bates (Titanic, The Office(TV))

Genre: Thriller

Why You Should Watch It: Based off the 1987 Stephen King novel, Misery is a psycho thriller that will change how you look at a sledgehammer. Kathy Bates does a stunning job portraying the psychopathic Annie Wilkes and such a stunning job that she won an Academy Award for Best Actress.

**The Usual Suspects (1995)**

Director: Bryan Singer (X-Men, Valkyrie)

Starring: Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, Se7en), Gabriel Byrne (Miller’s Crossing, In Treatment(TV)), Chazz Palminteri (Poolhall Junkies, Bullets Over Broadway), Stephen Baldwin (The Best Brother)

Genre: Crime, Mystery, Thriller

Why You Should Watch It: Keyser Söze. Keyser Söze. Keyser Söze. Keyser Söze.  Who the fuck is Keyser Söze? The fun isn’t in knowing, it’s the adventure of finding out. It also won Academy Awards for Screenplay and Supporting Actor, if that means anything to you. Oh, also, it’s a fucking awesome movie.

**Die Hard 2: Die Harder. (1990)**

Director: Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Long Kiss Goodnight)

Starring: Bruce Willis (Ashton Kutcher’s ex-husband inlaw), William Atherton (Real Genius), Bonnie Bedelia (Parenthood(TV))

Genre: Action, Adventure (John McClane Style)

Why You Should Watch It: Seriously, did you read the subtitle? DIE HARDER. This movie is so hard, you won’t even believe how hard it is. It’s that hard. If that hasn’t convinced you, then I got nothing for you because I have never seen this movie. It is a John Mclane joint though, so terrorists get dead and America gets saved.

**Rain Man (1988)**

Director: Barry Levinson (The Natural)

Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise (Very Easily Brain Washed), Valeria Golino (Hot Shots!, Foreign Films)

Genre: Drama

Why You Should Watch It: Douchebag Tom Cruise. Autistic Dustin Hoffman. Four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Orginal Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor (Hoffman). I feel no need to continue.

**The Terminator (1984)**

Director: James Cameron (Blue People Pocahontas, Titanic)

Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger (“Who is your daddy, and what does he do?”), Linda Hamilton (T2), Michael Biehn (Aliens, The Abyss)

Genre: Action, Sci-Fi

Why You Should Watch It: “Your clothes... give them to me, now.” These Arnold gems continue throughout which in itself is reason enough to watch. Spawning multiple sequels and television shows, this is a sci-fi thriller classic that is awesome AND you’ll get some good 80’s movies laughs from it.

**Spaceballs (1987)**

Director: Mel Brooks (The Producers, Blazing Saddles)

Starring: Mel Brooks, John Candy (Uncle Buck, Cool Runnings), Bill Pullman (Independence Day, Casper), Rick Moranis (Currently serving 2 years for child endangerment)

Genre: Comedy, Parody

Why You Should Watch It: Always on the list for top parody movies of all time, Spaceballs brings the funny to a trilogy that needed the funny. That may be a lie, both parts, but it was the first Start Wars movie parody, setting up current spoofs from the likes of Robot Chicken and Family Guy. Where would Seth Green and Seth MacFarlane be today without Mel Brooks paving the way into the future of creating Star Wars material that people actually want to watch? Creating Star Trek parodies, that’s where…*shivers*

**The Dirty Dozen (1967)**

Director: Robert Aldrich (The Longest Yard)

Starring: Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Chrales Bronson, John Cassavetes

Genre: Action, Drama, Comedy

Why You Should Watch It: The Dirty Dozen follows 12 convicted felons who are summoned to serve in an experimental WW2 platoon to carry out a specific mission involving killing German generals. There is drama, there are laughs, there are action scenes, shit blows up, and people get killed. You never thought you could enjoy a 1967 film so much, until you realize The Graduate and Cool Hand Luke came out the same year.

**Lethal Weapon 1 &amp; 2 (1987, 1989)**

Director: Richard Donner (The Omen, Superman)

Starring: Mel Gibson (Homophobic, Anti-Semitic, Misogynist), Danny Glover, Gary Busey (1), Joe Pesci (2)

Genre: Action, Inter-racial Buddy Cop Films

Why You Should Watch It: Honestly, I haven’t seen either of these movies fully, but from the bits I do recall seeing it was a fun action cop drama with some dry humor. I have heeded my own advice and added them to the ever growing list, “Shit to watch on Netflix Instant”.  If you enjoy other Inter-racial buddy cop films such as Beverly Hills Cops 1-7, these two films are right up your alley. They made a total of four of these, so they can’t be too terrible, right?

**XXX (2002)**

Director: Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious)

Starring: Vin Diesel, Asia Argento (Foreign Films), Samuel L. Jackson (“Hold on to your butts”)

Genre: Mindless Action

Why You Should Watch It: I can’t in good conscious actually recommend this film unless you have no interest in thinking, you like seeing things blow up, enjoy salivating over dude sweat or get excited over glimpses of attractive females. It could be a good background movie, or a good way to start the night out with a fun drinking game. How about, every time Vin Diesel says something, awesome? Get ready for fun.

**Trainspotting (1996)**

Director: Danny Boyle (28 Days Late, Slumdog Millionaire)

Starring: Ewan McGregor (Star Wars I-III, Moulin Rouge!), Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller (Hackers), Kevin McKidd (Grey’s Anatomy)

Genre: Crime, Drama, Drugs

Why You Should Watch It: Academy Award Nomination. British Academy Film Award Nominations and won Best Screenplay. Ranked 10th in the Brithish Film Institues top 100 British Films. A cult classic. Ewan McGregor. Ranked 7th best motion picture soundtrack in history by Vanity Fair. A great depiction of the depressing highs and lows of heroin addiction. The list goes on. Just watch the damn movie already.

**Bonus Television Show-**

**Mad Men (2007-Season 5 coming 2012)**

Creator: Matthew Weiner

Starring: Jon Hamm, Elisabeth Moss(The West Wing), Vincent Kartheriser(Angel)

Genre: Drama

Why You Should Watch It: This swell time piece has won thirteen Primetime Emmys, and four Golden Globes, among countless nominations in its short 4 year running. I just started catching up on these and I can assure you, you won’t be disappointed. It has been known to cause depression in those who are not able to drink while on the job, so be careful out there folks.

I was trolling through the british TV section looking for some cheap titty action. I saw peep show and thought it was a slam dunk. Very few tits, but a great British comedy told from the point of view of all of the characters. By ""point of view"" I mean exactly that...sometimes the camera is from the character's point of view and you can hear their thoughts. Very odd concept but well done. 

The main characters are hopelessly awkward and hopelessly stupid, and it's comedy GOLD watching them (and hearing their internal dialog justifying their actions).
