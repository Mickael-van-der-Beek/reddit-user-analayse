1354740805.0,1313,self.baseball,14ccca,My Dad's last chance to get in the Hall of Fame. Anything r/baseball can do would be incredible.,tay_murph,1641,328,416,http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/14ccca/my_dads_last_chance_to_get_in_the_hall_of_fame/,"EDIT: My brother and I have created an actual petition on Change.org Please take a second to sign it. We are trying to get the attention of the BBWAA Here is the link: http://goo.gl/PJNNB

Dale Murphy is my Dad. He is the greatest person in the entire world. Besides that, he is one of only 2 players (Roger Maris being the other) to have won 2 MVP awards and not be inducted into the Hall of Fame. He absolutely DOMINATED the 1980's. Most importantly, he played the game steroid and drug-free, providing a great example for me and other kids that grow up idolizing sports figures. This idea has been not only tainted but lost throughout the steroid era. Were it not for injury prone knees, his career would have been even longer and more successful. I'm posting here (for the first time ever) to raise awareness in this crucial Hall of Fame year. It is the first time that Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Roger Clemens will be on the ballot. That is the hot topic in baseball. Do they deserve a place in the Hall? To quote the Baseball Hall of Fame Website under Rules of Voting:

""5. Voting: Voting shall be based upon the player's record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.""

It's time to start voting for the right reasons. A combination of respect for the game and skill is what the Hall of Fame claims to be looking for. Yet Dale Murphy has been on the outside looking in for 14 years!

This year is the last year my Dad will be on the ballot. He is too humble to come out and campaign for himself. Discuss, share, debate. 

The numbers are there. But THIS IS NOT A POST ABOUT NUMBERS. It's a call to the Baseball Hall of Fame and it's voters to observe the criteria listed to be inducted. Off the field should matter just as much as on the field. If it does not, then take it out of the ""rules of voting.""

1355766962.0,487,self.baseball,150434,Dear Blue Jays Fans:,MrDNL,579,92,305,http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/150434/dear_blue_jays_fans/,"Hi. I'm Dan. I'm a 30-something, life-long Mets fans. I remember 1986 and, [unfortunately for us](http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/1993.shtml) but [awesomely for you](http://i.imgur.com/JKsLV.jpg), 1993. And some point this year, I hope to be at Yankee Stadium, cheering for R.A. Dickey and Jose Reyes. If you see me there -- or any of the hundreds of other Mets fans who will probably be there -- say hi. 

Dickey is not just a great pitcher -- and he _is_ great, don't let the naysayers tell you otherwise -- but a great player to root for. Those of us who have followed him since his Mets debut in 2010 have come to revel in excellence, following his story as something that extends beyond the game in the best of ways. In the same way that beat writers revere Jeff Francoeur, we do Dickey. And he hits about as well as Frenchy does, too. (Oh, and he's lights out on the mound.) It's rare that you have a legit star who respects the game like Crash Davis and appreciates the fact that he's getting millions to play a game any of us would gladly do for a micro-fraction of that. You're getting someone special.

You're also getting someone special in Reyes. Any negative reputation he has is unfounded, a byproduct of his energy. He'll dance. He'll high-five in funky ways. He'll smile all the way around the bases. The other teams will hate him for it, because they believe that baseball is a serious game and there's no room for fun. Cheering him on is infectious; you'll see.

We're excited to get d'Arnaud and Syndergaard but it's bittersweet. And, all else equal, I'd rather be in your situation.

If you're against this deal, you may not see it this way, but TdA and Syndergaard just did their job. Before 2006, the Mets had a top prospect -- BA #9 -- Lastings Milledge. And before 2007, we had BA #22 -- Fernando Martinez. And we also had Aaron Heilman, who had a really solid 2005 out of the pen.

From 2006 to 2008, the Mets were one big player away from being a borderline 100-win team, but the front office decided to go with what they had instead of cashing in these prospects for that big name. There are no guarantees in baseball, of course, but with the benefit of hindsight, we realize how big of a mistake it was to not try and turn those three into someone bigger. (And, [ugh](http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2006/10/healey-red-sox.html). [Ugh](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ramirma02.shtml#2007-2008-sum:batting_standard).)

Your window is HUGE right now. HUGE. The AL East is as weak as it's been in recent memory, with the Yankees (still good) old and busted, literally; the Red Sox, reeling; the Orioles are the Orioles; and the Rays just sold off or otherwise lost about 10 fWAR. The AL Central, outside the Tigers, doesn't have a 90-win team in it. The West is going to have three good teams, but with the extra Wild Card, you're in great shape. I'm jealous, in fact.

While I hope the Mets make it to October, I'm realistic. So I expect to be cheering for your team during the playoffs.

Have a great 2013,

1341935826.0,474,self.baseball,wbz90,My thoughts as a lifelong Royals fan on what happened to Cano.,the_mattador,630,156,529,http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/wbz90/my_thoughts_as_a_lifelong_royals_fan_on_what/,"Let me start by saying that I am not trying to justify what happened last night; I only want to offer an explanation. 

So by now everyone is aware that Cano was booed relentlessly last night during his time at the plate and on camera.  What’s more, his outs were cheered.  

If you have a minute, go to Sporcle and take the NFL teams quiz.  When you’re done, click on “Stats,” and see which team is forgotten the most.  Now do the same for MLB.  Spoiler alert: It us…In both games.  

You might be saying to yourself, “If you want national attention, field a better team!” And I agree with you wholeheartedly.  The problem is it’s not only the nation that forgets about us, it’s our owner.  He doesn’t care about Kansas City, about baseball, or about winning.  He doesn’t even live in Missouri.  A self-confessed Cardinals fan, Glass is content to sit back and let his holdings turn him a marginal profit while his unqualified son presides over the team.  He not only allowed an All Star outfield to slip away, but also the one bona-fide starting pitcher that we have produced in the last 15 years.  And so, year in and year out, we field at best a slightly below average team and try not to lose 100 games.  This is how it has been my entire life.

But this year, the baseball gods granted us the All Star Game, an event we haven’t hosted since Tricky Dick Nixon was in the White House.  For three years we have been preparing for this – upgrading infrastructure, remodeling our stadium, and planning events.  Needless to say, this week is the biggest event to come to our city in years.  We don’t get to host (or participate in) Olympics, or Superbowls, or World Series, so this is it for us.  This is **the event** for Kansas City for the foreseeable future.  This is evidenced by the fact that we set records for attendance at the ASG 5k and the Futures Game.

And then, during an interview, the man responsible for selecting the HR Derby participants said that he would take a Royals player.  People here were giddy with excitement that our hometown hero, Billy Butler, would be hacking homeruns with the best hitters in the game on ESPN in primetime.  Billy Butler, a guy that **we** drafted and developed.  *Our* guy – on the big stage, representing *us*.  Not the Yankees, or Red Sox, or Cardinals, but the Royals.  Quick – name the last Royals player to compete in a HR Derby.  That’s right, it was Danny Tartabull in 1991.  Robinson Cano was going to end 20+ years of irrelevance, if only for one night, just by keeping his word.

And then, he didn’t do it.  I was annoyed, perhaps a little angry, but nothing more than that. I imagine most people felt the same.  But then both talk radio stations in town starting running with the story, and Royals blogs and websites started encouraging people to boo Cano.  I planned on jokingly booing once or twice him myself, betting that most people there would not be aware the situation.  I was very wrong.  The booing started as soon as they put him up on the big screen in batting practice.  It only got worse when he didn’t hit any homeruns.  The booing and cheering for outs grew exponentially with each out that he made.

My theory on the booing is that it happened for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, people wanted to show solidarity for Billy, to let him know that we care and we support him.  By booing Cano while he was hitting, people were trying to force the talking heads on the broadcast to mention Billy as the explanation; a plan that I am told didn’t work out.  The other was to exercise some anger and frustration.  Midwesterners have been neglected by national sports media for years, and this was our chance to do something to stand out, something worth noting.  People were angry with Cano, but he was more of a scapegoat for deeper reaching issues. 

I apologize for being so long winded. If you think I am totally off-base (no pun intended), or that I missed something, I would be happy to discuss it.  Thank you for reading.

TL;DR – Robbie Cano felt the brunt of Kansas City’s frustration with an absentee owner, a perennially substandard team, and irrelevancy in general.

1355842944.0,428,self.baseball,151xop,Most and least favorite teams survey results!,thedeejus,500,72,728,http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/151xop/most_and_least_favorite_teams_survey_results/,"OK, so first of all, thanks to the 2,606 of you who filled out the survey. We even managed to get 24 Marlins fans.  There is a lot of very cool data to play with here, and I can slice the data any which way.  Here's a couple interesting things to start off:

First of all the top favorite teams were a bit surprising:  Blue Jays led with 11.1%, followed closely by the Giants (11.0%), A's (7.8) Red Sox (7.6) then Yankees (7.3).  This is after the data was cleaned for suspected ballot-busting (I looked for identical submissions sent consecutively - one fortuitous Red Sox fan submitted the same ballot 21 times in a row!)  Bottoming out the list were the Marlins, Padres, Royals, Rockies and Diamondbacks, all bunched up between 1-2%.

[Graph courtesy of timaldinho](http://i.imgur.com/ZniXm.png)

Big surprise - the Yankees were the most hated team with 64.9% of respondents indicating they hated them, and an additional 19.7% disliking them, for a total of nearly 85% of respondents either disliking or hating the Yankees, making them by far the least-liked team in the majors.  Next were the Red Sox (68% hated or disliked), Phillies (58.4), Cardinals (51.6) and Angels (47.5).

The least-disliked teams were the Mariners and Blue Jays (tied at 9.7% hated or disliked), Royals (10.9%), Orioles (12.1%) and the Pirates and Padres (tied at 13%).

To figure out the most popular team (not necessarily the same thing as least hated), I decided to ignore primary team, and assign a mean score based only on ratings 1-4 (i.e., what did non-fans of a team think about that team, to avoid undue influence of popular teams?)  The most popular teams were, unsurprisingly, scrappy upstart teams who were good this season after being mediocre the past couple years: Topping the list were the Orioles (M=3.29), followed very closely by the A's (3.28), then the Rays (3.16), Mariners (3.15), Blue Jays (3.12), Pirates (3.10) and Nationals (3.07).

Bottoming out that list were the Yankees (M=1.42), Red Sox (1.96), Phillies (2.20), Cardinals (2.33) and Marlins (2.40).

The most indifferent teams were the Padres, with 76.2% of respondents indicating the could not possibly care less about this team, followed by the Astros (73.6%), Royals (71.1%), Rockies (70.7%), Diamondbacks (70.3%) and Indians (68.3%).


Here's a table if you want to copy it into Excel and fiddle with it, it's sorted by ""Avg2"" which the the rating I used for popularity ignoring favorite team.  Avg1 is simply the mean, including favorite team, but keep in mind it might be skewed by popular teams:

Also, another thing I tried out was to figure which teams were most similar to one another, using the proportion of love/like/indifferent/dislike/hate, using a least-sum-of-squares method for the differences between the five categories.  Here are the results (similar teams often are, but need not be reflexive):

Here's a table summarizing same-city teams' opinions of each other.  Looks like the Bay Area teams are most supportive of each other (Giants fans especially love the A's), while the NY teams hate each other, plus a couple other major rivalries:

There are lots of other neat things I can do with this data - for example, among Yankees Fans (NYY=5), 83% hate the Red Sox, but only 7.9% hate the Blue Jays; among Red Sox fans, 94.4% hate the Yankees and 4.5% dislike them (i.e., 99% hate or dislike the Yankees, or all but two respondents).  One Red Sox fan ""likes"" the Yankees, and the other one listed the Red Sox and Yankees as their two favorite teams.

If you can think of any other cross-tab analyses like this you're interested in, let me know in the comments and I'll try to get to the more popular ones.

EDIT:

Behold the gigundo-table.  I hope this works.  Going across is what each team thinks of each other team (using average rating), going down is what each other team thinks of an individual team, so you can see who hates your team the most, and who your team hates the most, etc.  You'll probably want to copy this into Excel:

New moderator laaabaseball here! Over the last week the mod team has been discussing the sidebar and layout in depth, especially after all of your [feedback](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/tea50/does_anybody_else_have_an_issue_with_the_baseball/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/sv84w/rbaseball_would_it_be_possible_to_have_the/).

Well take a look at the new layout! New curvy boxes, blue headers with ribbon effects, and a bunch of little things that you'll have to find yourself :)

Oh, and I have to apologize.. those pesky (for RES users) team subreddits in the header overlapping and conflicting with the userbar was [my idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/fwh80/hey_rbaseball_what_do_you_think_of_this_for_the/). :(

This is a problem no more! The new layout features a fancy dropdown menu with the team subreddits, and the standings in the sidebar. There are also a few new tweaks that will make the subreddit look nicer, and some that add a small bit of functionality!

Examples:

[Youtube Video Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAKt3fhvrKk)

[MLB.com link](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings)

| OMG | A | TABLE | :)| 
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| [MLB](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings)   | STUFF  | Yeah! |  **MORE!**  |  |


Updated spoiler code (old one doesn't work anymore)

\[x kills y\]\(/spoiler\)

Example:

[x kills y](/spoiler)


If you have any issues/suggestions with the new layout, please [message me directly](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=laaabaseball&amp;subject=r/baseball%20layout) or [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbaseball)!

I was visiting my little cousin in New York, this was a couple years ago in 2011.  We walked into get something to eat at some restaurant, my aunt was with us at the time.  About half into the meal I spotted A rod sitting across the restaurant with what looked like to be his friends (all guys).  My cousin (12 at the time) was wearing a yankees 2009 world champions shirt.  During the end of our meal we were waiting for the check and Arod's table was just about to leave.  His friends left and he didn't leave with them, instead he stayed behind and quietly asked the front desk for a piece of paper and a pen.  As he was leaving he came over to our table (across the other side of the restaurant like I said before) and gave my cousin his autograph.  He sat down and talked with us for a few minutes before leaving, and seemed like an incredibly awesome guy.


Even though I may not like what he has done with the performing enhancing drugs in his career, he seems like a nice guy.  Which is why I am going to be rooting for him tonight, even if he does get booed (which he will).  

This event has made it difficult to hate him for what he has done over the years. ",,False,,t5_2qm7u,False,,mlb,True,t3_1jrpsv,http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1jrpsv/my_a_rod_story/,
