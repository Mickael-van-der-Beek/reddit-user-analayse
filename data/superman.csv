1371807306.0,213,self.superman,1gsb4n,Aquaman was there in Man of Steel,le_me,244,31,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gsb4n/aquaman_was_there_in_man_of_steel/,"So here is something that I have been thinking about. This can set up a perfect tie-in with Aquaman.

Aquaman was there in Man of Steel and there are some pretty good instances that actually point to it:



**Why did the oil rig blow up?**

This has been mentioned before - **The name of the drilling company was Merrevale Oil, which is the same company that drills in Atlantean ground in the comics.**

It was Aquaman who sabotaged that rig. I like to think that Aquaman has had it with the continued pollution of the oceans and has started taking a stand.

The sequel movie could show some naval intelligence picked up by a Wayne Tech Satellite that describes an incredibly fast moving and compact ""bogey"" under water.




**The Whales?**

Why were whales hanging around the blown up oil rig? They were doing whale calls (signalling to Aquaman?).

Superman was floating in the water and the whales were at a distance... the scene cuts after that and Superman is shown stealing clothes.

I say the whales made sure that Superman was alright and ""washed up ashore"" before gaining consciousness and hence not interfere with Aquaman's plans.




**After defeating the world engine**

The world engine lands in the Indian Ocean (practically Aquaman's backyard). After it has been destroyed... Superman is again found conveniently lying on a beach and soaking in that sweet sweet solar juice.

I think that he was carried there by Aquaman or some of his dolphins.


I know .. it feels like I am grasping at straws.. but it makes too much sense. What do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,1371811342.0,,,True,t3_1gsb4n,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gsb4n/aquaman_was_there_in_man_of_steel/,

1372724811.0,132,self.superman,1hgp83,The Superman Movie We Needed (or Why I Loved MoS),WilliamMcCarty,151,19,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hgp83/the_superman_movie_we_needed_or_why_i_loved_mos/,"I'm 36 years old.  I've been a Superman fan as long as I can remember.  This is lengthy and not for everybody so feel free to quit reading now or at any point hereafter.  

I had issues with nearly every aspect of the movie before
 it was released.  The suit, the cast, the story (what I’d heard of
 it).  Everything.  But every concern I had was wiped away soon as I
 saw it.

 Krypton was cold and calculating, not quite as sterile as John Byrne’s
 which I loved, but still detached and inhuman.  Something so far from
 humankind that it wasn’t an ideal for Superman to strive toward, but
 as a warning of something to avoid.  Jor El says that Superman can
 serve as an example to the people of Earth but I don’t believe its in
 the way that people think, it’s not in regard to Superman being a
 genetically perfect being but rather, in the way that Jon and Martha
 Kent raised him.  Someone who does the right thing because it’s the
 right thing to do.  Not for glory or justice or honor or vengeance.
 But just because he can and therefore should.  There’s a line
 somewhere, not in the movie but elsewhere, “He’s not Superman because
 he can fly.  He’s Superman because a good couple from Kansas loved
 their son.”  HE could just as easily have been a bad man and a
 conqueror of worlds with all his power but he’s a good man because he
 was raised to be good.  It’s the opposite of what Krypton is.  You can
 only be what they decide you’re to be.  What if a child dreamt of
 something more?

 The cast.  I wouldn’t have picked a single one of these people to be
 in this movie.  And that’s all right.  They were perfect.  Henry
 Cavill? Sure, he’s fine in the Tudors, but Superman?  Yes, Superman.
 He looked the part.  He was tall, handsome, buff,  he looked like
 freaking Superman!  And he played the part just right.  Strong and
 forceful with just a hint of uncertainty, the way a novice Superman
 would be like.  He had it down perfectly.  Much the way Christian Bale
 I never would have imagined as Batman/Bruce Wayne he was the perfect
 person for the role.  Henry Cavill embodied the character of Superman
 and Clark Kent perfectly.  He is Superman for me now, he replaces
 every other person to ever wear the cape.

 As does Amy Adams for Lois.  Tough as nails, no nonsense, go out and
 get what she wants Lois.  The Lois from the books.  Red hair?  I
 didn’t see it.  But honestly, how could you make a character like Lois
 better?  Make her a redhead!  Again, never thought it would work but
 it was perfect.  She inserted herself into situations and dangerous
 elements, she was an equal part of the action, she was the way the
 character is in the books.  I always think of a line from the books
 where she says one of her main attractions to Superman is that she
 finally found a man who could keep up with her.  This is the Lois we
 need and expect, not a damsel in distress or a shrill chain smoker.

 Other cast—Laurence Fishburne as Perry White.  I was annoyed, I admit.
  Yes, he’s a good actor but Perry White?  I didn’t see it.  Then he
 appeared on screen.  He was more polished than the Perry White I’m
 used to or expected.  But that’s ok.  His attitude was Perry all the
 way.  Forceful, stubborn, a big, loud behemoth of a man who respects
 his reporters but puts them in their place.  That’s Perry.  He owned
 it.  Kevin Costner and Diane Lane? Again, not what I’d imagined but
 they were perfect in those roles.   Replacing Jimmy Olsen with Jenny?
 If they ever tried something like this in the books I’d be livid but
 in a movie?  The character is barely more than a glorified extra.  It
 wasn’t all that big a deal.  Besides, the scene near the end with her
 and Perry …could you really see that working with a frecklefaced
 redheaded little dude?  Nah, me either.

 Zack Snyder.  The man can’t coax a performance out of an actor to save
 his life.  He’s not a great director that way.  He is great at making
 things look awesome.  And he did.  The movie looked brilliant.  And
 his heavyhanded directing style was severely toned down for this
 movie,  I would barely know it was Zack Snyder directing this.  He had
 a cast of real actors who know they craft and didn’t need a director
 to hold their hand and walk them through every scene.  He sat behind
 the camera, made things look good and let them do their jobs.  It was
 perfect.

 The suit.  I was horrified when I saw it.  How does Ma Kent make that
 thing?  Why does it look like scuba gear?  At least there’s no red
 undies.  It didn’t look good to me.  I liked elements of it but as a
 whole?  Ugh.  Then I saw it onscreen.  Watching it sitting in a glass
 case or in a still photo was one thing but seeing it on a living,
 breathing, moving person is a whole different thing.  It worked.  And
 the story for the suit was more than acceptable by me.  Kryptonian
 garb.  Ma Kent didn’t make it.  Ok, the explanation for its existence in the movie works for me.

 The story itself.  What I wanted when they were making this movie was
 what I got with Batman Begins.  That movie was essentially the comics
 put on screen.  I wanted that so badly for Superman.  That was not
 what we got.  We got something different.  It was a really completely
 different origin story but had some many elements of the books that it
 both familiar and new at the same time.  The deviations in canon from
 the books were forgivable to me because they were still rooted in the
 comic lore and worked so well on screen.  For example, as I’d said,
 Byrne’s Krypton was a sterile environment but this Krypton was a live
 and biological world.  Though, like Byrne’s Krypton children were
 grown in test tubes essentially, genetically manipulated.  The servant
 droids Kelex and Kelor both appeared in the movie and books,
 remarkable similar to their appearances in the books.  Later, in the
 Kryptonain scout ship there’s images of Kryptonians that remarkably
 resemble the statues scene in the books in Superman’s Fortress of
 Solitude though they aren’t statues in the movie.  I recognized them
 immediately.

 One of my main problems with Zod or any other Kryptonian coming to
 earth as a full grown adult would be that they would be overwhelmed by
 their newfound senses, almost to a crippling degree.  This very thing
 happened in the movie.  It was a genius bit of writing and it made me
 feel the realistic, true to the characters approach this movie was
 taking.

 The pace bothered some but I thought it was broken up well.  We didn’t
 have to sit through a lengthy backstory and tedious growing pains to
 get to an adult Clark doing superhero stuff.  The growing pains and
 backstory comes in flashbacks that punctuate events in his adult life.
  Some people complained that the movie didn’t really have enough story
 but it clocked in at nearly two a half hours.  During which time we
 saw Krypton live and die, Clark develop and learn to use his powers,
 meet Lois, learn of his origins, confront the US Government, visit an
 alien spacecraft and oh yeah, save the whole world.  There was a lot
 going on in that movie.  There was plenty of story there.  If they
 crammed in more dialogue or other scenes there would have been
 complaints that it was too long and things could have been cut.  Far
 as I’m concerned the pacing was fine and the lack of story complaints
 are utter bull.

 People said it was too dark and there was no humor.  I don’t believe
 it was too dark.  When you think about it, Superman’s tale has always
 been a rather dark one.  Orphaned, his world and race destroyed,
 raised by a kind couple who do their best but he’s still an outsider
 who struggles with who and what he is, keeping the world at arm’s
 length for his whole life. That’s kind of depressing when you think
 about it.  About time we actually saw that side of his character
 expressed.  But no humor?  I grinned a fair bit during that movie.

 “Well, here it’s an ‘S’.”

 “I think he’s kinda hot.”

 Clark: “I’m the one they’re looking for.”  Priest:  gulp.

 Lois:  “They say it’s all downhill after the first kiss.”  Superman:
 “I think it only counts if you’re kissing a human.”

 Superman: “You’re trying to find where I hang my cape.  You won’t.”

 And some scenes by themselves.  Superman’s dramatic take to the skies, he’s
 supposes to be shooting up into the skies, flying, soaring through the
 heavens and…he hops.  Then comes the flight and…no, he falls on his
 ass.  I thought that was kind of funny, myself.  Don’t know if it was
 intended that way but it made me chuckle.

 People complain about the action.  Too much?  Too much action in a
 Superman movie?  Really?  What would you have in a Superman movie besides 
 action?  He’s Superman!  He’s supposed to be in action!  He flies for
 god’s sake!  He soars through space and battles alien invaders and
 saves the world.  He does that on a fairly routine basis on the books,
 no reason he shouldn’t do it on screen, too.  You could argue some of
 the action was dizzying and maybe you’re right but I’d say “Not it a
 bad way.”  Explosions, alien ships blasting things, superhero and
 supervillian throwing down in the skies and streets, this was the
 stuff of the comics on screen, the page brought to life!  It was
 amazing and breathtaking and made me want to jump out of my seat and
 throw punches at the screen when Superman landed hit after hit into
 Zod and sends him tumbling through the skies.  It was big,
 adventurous, super action and I wanted to scream “Yes!” every time
 something incredible happened onscreen.

 And the end.  People complain about the end.  What exactly would you
 have him do?  Let Zod carry on fighting, creating more devastation?
 Zod said it himself, “It only ends one way—either you die or I die.”
 Zod proclaimed himself a warrior, that everything he did was for
 Krypton and his people and they are all gone.  He had nothing to live
 for anymore.  His only recourse was total annihilation of everything
 around him and he has the capability and the will to do it.  Superman
 was not reckless.  During the battle with Zod he takes every
 opportunity to take to the skies, to leave the ground and get away
 from buildings and people but it’s Zod who keeps bringing it back into
 the populated areas.  Even in the battle at Smallville Superman is
 aware that lives are at stake and urges people to get to safety.  The
 only time we see him act in any way reckless is when he first attacks
 Zod and ponds him mercilessly, driving him through a gas station and
 grain silo.  But if you think about it, first Zod was attacking his
 mother and who amongst us wouldn’t wail on someone attacking our
 mother?  And two, this is the first time in his life Clark has struck
 out in anger.  He’s never hit anyone in his life until this moment.
 He did so in defense of his family.  Sudden aggression and the
 reckless behavior that can come with that is understandable.  But back
 in Metropolis, we don’t see him act in haste or carelessness.  He’s
 well aware of what he’s doing with Zod and what’s happening around
 him.  He’s faced with an impossible choice.  In the books, remember,
 alien invasions and superpowered beings are the norm.  They have
 prisons to hold these people and ways to nullify their abilities.  Not
 so in the world of this Superman in the movie.  This is our world and
 no such methods to contain the likes of Zod exist.  Remember, too,
 that in the books, Superman executed Zod.  He did so with Kryptonite,
 stood before him and exposed Zod to the radioactive rock and watched
 him grow weaker, choke , collapse and writhe about until he died a
 slow, agonizing death.  In every way, it was a more brutal,
 excruciating death than what occurred onscreen.  Superman snapped
 Zod’s neck in a last ditch effort to save people.  To prevent death.
 In the books, Zod had already massacred five billion people.  And he
 would have done so again.  Just like Zod in the movie, he was an
 unstoppable force of destruction and the only way to prevent it was to
 end him.  Simply because Superman killed does not make him a bad
 person.  Jor El killed people in this movie.  Lois killed people.
 They are not evil or cruel or heartless.  They killed in defense of
 their families or themselves.  Superman killed in order to save the world, to save the 
 lives of seven billion people, and in doing so he orphaned himself
 again, becoming truly the last of his race and crossing a line no one
 should be forced to cross.  And he doesn’t do so without regret or
 remorse, we see him in turmoil over the act he was forced to commit.
 He suffers for what he had to do.

 I think we can all say there’s things we would have liked to seen or
 things we would have wanted differently.  But in the end, that really
 comes down to “That’s not how I would have done it” and it’s simply
 not fair to judge the movie that way.  Did it entertain us?  Did it
 give us a good story with big action and Superman saving the world in
 the most grand, epic fashion he could?  Yes.  The answers are yes.
 Even I’ll admit it’s not the Superman movie I wanted.  But that is in
 no way whatsoever a bad thing.  As the song says, you can’t always get
 what you want but sometimes you get what you need.  This was the
 Superman movie we needed.  A huge, sweeping, fate of the world at
 stake epic with heart and soul.  Finally, for the first time we saw
 what Superman could really be capable of, we saw what he could do and
 how he really is.

 No matter what happens next—if the sequels suck or the Justice League
 butchers the character and the studio goes all to hell with it—we can
 take this movie, this moment and this Man of Steel and say yes, just
 this once, they got it right, I saw what I always wanted to see.",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,,True,t3_1hgp83,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hgp83/the_superman_movie_we_needed_or_why_i_loved_mos/,

I made the mistake of reading many (spoiler-free) reviews. I read both good and I read bad. I thought beforehand that I appreciated the ""bad"" reviews because they lowered by expectations, thus allowing me to be blown away. Not true. They gave me reasons to not like the movie.

I found that throughout the movie the negative reviews starting nagging at me. As an avid fan I don't know if I was able to enjoy the movie as much because I started to catch the things that the negative reviewers were saying.

At the end of the movie, I found that I had enjoyed it - but my mind was bugging me about those things that the critics harped on. Plot holes, too serious of a tone, rushed story, etc. Even though I enjoyed it, I felt like since I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have, that I was cheated.

On the drive home from the theater - I began to analyze it more fully. I came to my senses. I started to feel that the movie really was well paced. It told just enough story. It developed the important characters VERY well (Superman, Lois, Jor-EL, Zod, Pa Kent, etc). The other characters that weren't so well developed (Perry White, Jenny ""Olsen"", etc) I found I didn't care for anyway. I realized with the flying scenes, the action, the destruction, the heat vision, the x-ray vision, everything about it was MY kind of Superman movie. THIS is the way I want Superman portrayed.

The more I thought about it - the more I thought those things that are currently getting this movie low scores are just trivial and pointless. Sure there may be some plot holes. I can't think of any specifically...but were they big enough to ruin the movie? Of course not!

Overall, this is my favorite Superman movie. This is my favorite super-hero/comic book movie (even more than TDK, sorry Bats). This is the way I want The Man of Steel portrayed. 9.5/10

To those of you who haven't seen it, don't let the negative reviews get you down. Go in with an open mind and enjoy the film! If you find yourself a little disappointed, or even if you find yourself ecstatic about it, take a little while and analyze the movie for what it is. Try to decide if those things that bugged you were really that important...and then maybe you'll come to the conclusion like I did and realize this movie really is incredible!

As he is walking towards them, he makes a fist and then un-clinches it. He looks uncomfortable and unsure of himself. Then it hit me...Clark had never hit anyone (with the exception of Zod a couple of seconds earlier out of anger). 

This is huge to me as Clark grew up having to hold back (note to flashback where he told Pa Kent that he really wanted to hit that bully and also the scene at the bar). Now, he has to fight to protect Earth and his family. Not only that, he has grown up being told how special he is and how strong and indestructible he is. All of the sudden, there are multiple people from his home planet that have been trained to fight and kill (Based on Jor-El's description of Zod). They have the same powers and probably know how to utilize them better than he can. For the short moment, he had to process that he could easily lose this fight and let everyone down. For the first time, he felt vulnerable. 

I've seen the movie twice, and this was definitely my favorite part of the movie. ",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,1371860755.0,,,True,t3_1gtq0d,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gtq0d/small_scene_in_mos_that_made_the_movie_great_for/,

My favorite line was subtle but characterized the movie.,Nukemarine,115,17,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gftlq/just_saw_man_of_steel_last_night_my_favorite_line/,"Pa Kent ""Did they hurt you""; Clark ""You know they can't""; Pa Kent ""That's not what I meant"".

Reflects J. Michael Straczynski's take on Superman. You can't pierce his skin, but you can pierce his heart. He has the powers of a god, but the soul of a mortal. Pa knew the boys were tearing Clark apart emotionally making him question what's the right thing to do. Really, in the entire movie you knew Superman would not get hurt just like in that scene. Instead, you worried about how Superman would react to situations where he's emotionally invested.

I only saw the movie once and plan to see it again. Overall I was impressed by the quality and action. It was very fast paced so I do hope there's a 3.5 hour director cut in the making to flesh out the supporting characters. 

Oddly enough Michael Shannon's performance disappointed me the most. Part of it was I was impressed with the ads featuring him. However, all of those scenes were with him unhinged. In the movie, his subdued parts just sounded like he was reading off a teleprompter. Still, he had to play the part of the ultimate bully that Clark truly had to make his toughest decision.

PS: Fuck Rotten Tomatoes in this case.

**HOW CAN ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF MAN OF STEEL BE THE WANTON DESTRUCTION OF METROPOLIS?!**

It happens literally every time Superman gets into a fight with another superhuman. Zack Snyder was on the ball with the combat. It was lengthy, destructive, ridiculous, superhuman, and everything any comic fan would want it to be.

And it's not like Superman wanted all that destruction, but it just happens. It's inevitable. So good job Mr. Snyder for giving a comic book character a comic book live-action feature film.

&gt;There is not a single instance of Superman throwing a Kryptonian through a building outside of the very beginning whee Superman pounds Zod through an empty Silo after he threatens Ma. Zod throws Superman through buildings. Every single time. 

&gt;Superman tries to take the battle away from the center if Metropolis twice and the center of Smallville main street once. It's pretty subtle and understated, but each time he tries to fly away, he's instantly intercepted. The scene where Zod grabs him by the cape and flings him away was one of those scenes.

&gt;There is not a single instance of people running away from Zod/Superman during the climax. Every single building they fight through is completely empty. The city is basically abandoned.

&gt;The fight itself seems to be contained to mostly about 4 blocks? 

&gt;The US Military, on the other hand, does almost all of the collateral damage throughout the movies. Missiles are fired at the World Engine, only to be pushed away and fired into the streets. The Air Force literally fires rockets and a barrage of bullets down the crowded main street.

&gt;Superman saves several people during the main street fight. There is no one to actually save during the Zod fight since we never see anyone.",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,kingdom,True,t3_1h1vw0,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1h1vw0/man_of_steel_second_viewing_spoilers/,

Also I read a lot of the supposed plot holes people were submitting and I had the same thought while watching the first time but had come up with logical answers to all of them before seeing it again because I had time to let this movie sink in. The second time I saw it everything seemed perfect. It didn't feel rushed, it seemed there wasn't nearly as much action as I perceived the first time, the characters were well developed.

I think it goes without saying that, like the Batman series, an original story is a must. There's many questions, like what setting to use, how to write a solid plot etc. but the biggest problem with a Superman game is his invincibility. 

I've heard a lot of options for overcoming this:

* Red Sun Radiation- Superman is struck by red sun radiation in the opening of the game. He loses his powers and gains more and more powers with every mission. 

* Superman is a rookie- Clark Kent is a powerful alien from another planet but has not truly learned to harness his powers. He will gain abilities as time goes by.

* Time limits- Everything is on a strict time limit. Superman must be faster than a speeding bullet or he fails the mission. 

* Regenerative Health Bar- Neck down Superman's powers so he can be injured or pit him against Super-Powered, possibly kryptonian bad guys. 

Personally, I think the Red Sun angle could work, but... you couldn't use it twice. If you made a second game, in the same vein, this trick would lose its luster if used a second time. I'd have an elaborate combo system. 

Say there's a group of terrorists in a tense standoff with police. Superman flies in, and if they see you, a firefight starts and you lose the mission because you failed to de-escalate things. Instead, you fly in and x-ray vision tells you that there's 5 armed thugs. (Just like the Batman games.) Sneak up on one (sneak could by flying an inch off the ground rather than crouching. More Superman's style), knock him out. Two other guys are patrolling wait until they're alone and use super breath, heat vision or combat to take care of them quietly. In the last room, use heat vision to blow up a fire extinguisher... fly in, grab the two guys and fly them out the window to the police. Have a system where there's not mindless combat all the time (like in Superman Returns). Have a mode where you can slow down time, but Superman moves at his regular pace. To the other characters it would be as if he's using Super-speed. Don't use heat vision to blast scores of enemies all the time. It should be a precision device to melt guns, de-activate alarms etc.

Basically, I'd like a game where Lois and Clark work together on uncovering a huge story. Some missions are done as Clark, but Superman is needed as well. Have the game be almost like an open world game where some missions are only available as Clark Kent and some are only available as Superman. 

Anyway, in my opinion a good Superman game is possible, but game designers are scared to try. The only Superman game worth playing was Shadow of Apokolips... and there have been dozens of other attempts. 

Anyone have any other ideas of how to make an awesome game?",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,supes,True,t3_16vloe,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/16vloe/we_need_a_superman_videogame/,

2. I really enjoyed the depiction of Kal-El as a Christ-figure

3. The way they came up with the name ""Superman"" and introduced it was very clever.

4. The IMAX-3D is awesome with this movie. Very worth the extra costs.

5. If you watch carefully in the credits, Henry Cavill's character is listed as ""Clark Kent/Kal-El"", not as ""Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent"" or something along those lines. It's interesting because TDKR is the same way. Bale is listed as ""Bruce Wayne"" not ""Bruce Wayne/Batman"".

6. Following that, the film does focus more on the man in the suit (ie Clark Kent) than what the suit is doing (Superman). It's a lot like Nolan's Batman in that sense and it makes for a damn good movie.

7. The Krypton scenes were *SPECTACULAR!!* that could have easily filled a movie within itself.

8. If critics didn't like this movie, it's their problem.

TL;DR: The movie was absolutely fantastic. It really blew me away and is worth a watch. Or two. Or like 36.

However, after waiting 2 weeks, I finally went back yesterday with fresh eyes and an open mind and was honestly really, really happy with the movie. 

There was so much depth to the movie, as long as you can accept the pacing for what it is (which was my main problem the first time around) - the movie really does tell a beautiful story. I think that for anyone here who for whatever reason was on the fence the first time - go and watch the movie again. I walked out so stoked - I even began reading Superman comics lastnight (which I haven't done in years).

**extra reading for those interested**

I even mentally compared some scenes with what ""reviewers"" and critics complained about while they were playing - and man... it seems so trivial. Honestly, the problems that I originally had were NEVER mentioned in reviews, which were real issues (how scenes jumped around and were edited at times). This leads me to believe that some reviewers are influenced by other reviews, and couldn't actually think for themselves. I figure that since everyone was MIMICKING THE SAME ARGUMENTS. 

How can you find the same exact arguments repeated in the same industry and not think that there is something a bit fishy going on? I literally saw no unique criticisms about the movie, and when I was watching it yesterday and mentally comparing it to the argumenets made - I honestly felt that the problems that reviewers seemed to have were seriously misguided. If not for the mere fact that the same arguments were repeated again and again, and they were mainly personal issues (didn't like the ending, too much action, etc). Those are personal faults that they found with the movie, not faults that you could actually **measure against known solutions**.

The real problems with the movie, if you choose to see them, are superficial at best. Some editing problems and weird transitions at times - but as a whole, the movie tells a beautiful story and brings the fucking action. People seem to want the best of both worlds, and argue for it. Yet, when they finally have it - they compare it against other movies, like the Avengers, Dark Knight, etc, etc.

1374640807.0,60,self.superman,1ixq81,"Plato, The Republic, and Man of Steel",bergerwfries,69,9,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1ixq81/plato_the_republic_and_man_of_steel/,"Man of Steel is a dramatization of The Republic. Young Clark Kent reads The Republic while being bullied by kids from school. The bullies grab Clark from his seat, shove him towards a fence, and taunt him. Clark shows restraint, he doesn't respond to his tormentors, and they back away. The Republic is displayed prominently on the screen during this conflict. By flashing the book so clearly, the filmmakers accomplish two goals. First, it helps answer a nagging question about the origin of Superman's morals; he learned them. The Republic is certainly a book that a smart kid looking for moral guidance would seek out. Second, it acts as a key that uncovers philosophical depth in ""just another blockbuster."" 

Krypton is a corrupted version of the Ideal City. The Rulers have lost sight of the Good (they lack Moderation and destroy the planet by over-using the core), and the Guardians (Zod) are rebelling against the Rulers. The planet blows up not as a tragic accident, but because Krypton's society lacks the virtues that Plato describes.








Now, The Republic isn't just a piece of political writing. The Ideal City is a metaphor for the human soul. Man of Steel works the same way, as Jor-El imprints the Codex into his son. The Codex is Krypton, and Krypton is the Ideal City. Superman has the Ideal City inside himself; he is a perfectly just being. Plato writes that the City is a ""city of the mind,"" an ideal to strive for. Superman is described the same way, as an ideal to strive for. A person who has internalized the lessons of The Republic, who can see the Good perfectly, would look a lot like Superman.

The drama of Man of Steel revolves around Superman choosing between Krypton and Earth. And even though every cell in his body is of Krypton, he chooses Earth, rejecting the literal expression of the City in favor of imperfect Earth.

But why does Superman choose Earth? 








Plato wrote about education, especially the education of potential Philosopher Kings. In order to be a good ruler, you had to go through certain trials, and pass them. Superman went through many trials, and he resolved them by sticking to ideals and virtues that he trusted. He will risk being exposed to save a bus full of kids, but not to save his father. Seems like strange logic, but Jonathan Kent made the choice to sacrifice himself, and Superman honored that choice. He goes through growing pains, but generally shows incredible self-restraint. Superman is the embodiment of the Ideal City on many levels. He is Wise, and that means discerning the Good.

So on the one hand, you have half of The Republic: The person who has a soul in the image of the City. Superman.

On the other hand is the political philosophy of The Republic, the literal city. Krypton, in this case.

In Man of Steel, those two halves are pitted against one another, Superman against Krypton, ethical philosophy against political philosophy, soul against city.









Krypton, as discussed before, is corrupt. Superman gives the remnants of Krypton a chance. He walks up to the ship and takes a leap of faith that Zod will keep his word, because he's idealistic and has a strong view of the Good. And because he's wise and discerning, he takes a safety net along (the key). But Zod acts on bad faith, and Superman destroys them.

He destroys them mostly because he sees the corruption. Krypton had bad policies and bad leaders, and Zod overreacted to create more bad policies and bad leaders. Earth may not be a utopia, but to Superman it appeared better than the sick society he sees in Krypton.

On a subtextual level, Man of Steel is a rebuke to the people who take Plato literally as political philosophy, but an endorsement of his ethics. Man of Steel hopes to inspire us not to change our societies, but to change our souls.

(spoiler free review),jamce,81,26,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gbl8p/the_critics_are_insane_man_of_steel_is_amazing/,"Don't listen to the critics. I'm not sure if it's an elitist agenda against Snyder as a film maker or just nostalgic cinema fans who can't let go of the ""charming boy scout"" that set precedent over 20 years ago in Donner's camp-filled classic... but whatever the reason- Man of Steel is undeserving of the lackluster critical response it's receiving.

Man of Steel IS the Superman movie we've been waiting for.  And it really is epic.

No, this isn't your parent's Superman..
This is not golden or silver age Superman- THIS is for every kid that watched Bruce Tim's ""Adventures of Superman"" and ""Justice League"" or the DC animated films like ""Doomsday"" or ""Crisis on two earths"" and said ""why can't we see THIS Superman live action?!""
This is for anyone who watched Matrix and said ""now... why can't we have a Superman that does this?"" (no.. i'm not saying it's like the matrix- at all)

Now, i'm not a crier- especially at movies... but, this one had me a FEW times. There's a strong emotional thread that runs through the picture. As you follow this character who can't quite find his place, doesn't quite fit in- yet has a heart for people... a true good Samaritan, who even in the face of mockers risks his own life (to his knowledge) to save them... protect them.. you empathize with him.

The critics have it wrong- Clark's not dour in this movie, he's humble.
He's patient and compassionate. It's not apathy he's displaying... it's a disciplined reserve. He's a man who's learned that his power and how he chooses to use it will define who he will become. The truth is, we're seeing Clark WHILE he's still discovering himself- still finding out what the consequences are when he uses his abilities and also when he chooses not to use his abilities.

This is someone who's never been able to have a real relationship with anyone.(outside of his mom and dad) and throughout the course of the movie he learns to trust people- exemplified in one person that sees who he truly is, and is not only not afraid, but honors that trust.
The small moments are emotional and tender (and despite what you may have read- sometimes humorous. The audience in my theater laughed at least 2 or 3 times, out loud), the big ones are exhilarating and bombastic. The battles are TRULY epic- with much at stake...
This is OUR Superman...

Snyder has successfully shaken the campy ""gee whiz"" and ""Crime doesn't pay, evil doer"" caricature and given us the Superman we grew up hoping that someday... someday someone would be able to deliver and they did- and it's here- Man of Steel.
P.S. the entire audience loved the film, complete with applause at the end.",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,1371190106.0,,,True,t3_1gbl8p,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gbl8p/the_critics_are_insane_man_of_steel_is_amazing/,

I'll be driving from Austin though so ill most likely post any of my thoughts here and it will probably be tomorrow morning! :)


My SPOILER LIMITED review. I can include one with Spoilers or you can PM me for some.

This movie did it for me. I give it an 8.5/10 and the flaws that it did have seem like they will be addressed in the next film. Comparing this to the Nolan's Batman franchise it's better than Begins, and TDKR, imo. It's not better than TDK and this is coming from a Superman fan first. However, this is a reboot and it had to deal with origins which were pretty awesome to see. I don't think any comic reboot can be as good as TDK because Batman was already established when it came out and that's why I'm looking forward  to a sequel for this film. My only problems or the ""flaws"" that I had with this film were lack of time to develop a deep relationship with Clark and Lois. They do have great chemistry but It was a lot  harder to develop that without them SPOILER spending lots time together that they normally get from working the Daily Planet. SPOILER DONE I don't mean screen time either just time in general in the film. But I believe this will be solved since SPOILER he's working at the Daily Planet at the end of the film. SPOILER DONE That relationship should flourish even more than it already did. Their chemistry was GREAT. The only other flaw I had was there was some pretty noticeable CGI. I would of preferred that I didn't notice it but I'm nit picky. The film was beautiful visually and the parts I did notice didn't remove me from the experience I was having. It's not like it's during the entire movie either it's just in a few spots. I loved the pacing, flashbacks, Cavill was great as every persona and had his accent down perfectly, I loved the deep emotional feelings, I love how Superman did have to make a choice and boy was it a big one but I agreed with it. It was a beautiful film and had quite a few SPOILER Lexcorp nods from the building, a shipping type truck, and a tanker type truck from what I noticed. The Wayne enterprises satellite is shown very quickly and I nearly missed it. SPOILER DONE This film did exactly what a reboot needed to do and I'm so excited to see where they take it. There was so much to take it I need to see this again 2 possibly even 3 more times. Go buy a ticket this film is worth every penny.

1371976764.0,46,self.superman,1gwfwp,[SPOILERS] To all of you who think Superman just let people die:,Blasphemic_Porky,67,21,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gwfwp/spoilers_to_all_of_you_who_think_superman_just/,"Read [Adventure of Superman](http://www.comixology.com/Adventures-of-Superman-2013-7/digital-comic/DIG004827) #7 - 9, nine will be coming out next week I believe, and it explains how he prioritizes his day. How he decides to stop a war in another solar system than help the person getting beaten up, the water main breaking, and other issues. 

---

Also to all of you who thought he was careless, re-watch the movie and you will see little subtleties of him *caring*. Remember when Zod throws the Lex tanker at Superman and he dodges it and it hits a building? It is quick (you guys may need super reflexes to catch this one), but he looks at where it lands, longer than necessary, with an up and down, left and right head movement. I am assuming he is checking for damages, or survivors. 

---

One more thing, did any huge buildings fall in his fight with Zod other than the one Zod red-eyed, or the one the World Engine and his ship pulverized to dust?

---

And if Superman actually used his super speed to save everyone (already if he reaches anything close to the speed of light his surrounding should go nuclear and go boom) do you think the people would survive him even touching him?

Look at Faora punching those soldiers. If Supes does the same without slowing down *significantly* he will kill all those people, wasting time. That would be atrocious. 

Also, the way I am reasoning someone as the Flash can do that, is because the Flash manipulates the Speed Force and time stops for him and he is able to implement the speed force on others and that protects them, and other atoms and molecules in his surrounding, to explode. 

---

Lastly, shame on you people who blame all these deaths that was caused by **Zod** on Superman. That is *disgusting* and *despicable*. 

OK, then you don't like this Superman? Well do you think *your* Superman would blame this Superman for these deaths? Would *your* Superman stop MoS Supes because it was ""his fault"" for killing these people? Disgusting critic of the movie. Shame on any of you who thinks of that. Shame.   

It is like blaming Batman for not killing the Joker and making it Batmans' fault. Yeah it is a philosophical question and the controversial ending of Zod can be argued this way. A good controversy that we all need and can freely discuss. 

TL;DR: Humans make so many mistakes and fuck ups that, even though, Superman is amazing and awesome, he cannot be everywhere at once. Man of Steel Superman cares about people. 

---

EDIT: I want to mention that in the Smallville fight scene, Superman is seen a couple times trying to fly (if you re-watch it, notice his trademark arm stretched out with a fist) carrying Faora and Nam-Ek but he keeps getting stopped. Notice these things... confirm it to me, or deny it because the Smallville fight was the most stomach churning for me...",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,1372014026.0,,,True,t3_1gwfwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gwfwp/spoilers_to_all_of_you_who_think_superman_just/,

A Superman Fan weighs in.[Spoilers]",Siellus,49,7,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gdhj0/where_do_i_belong_a_superman_fan_weighs_inspoilers/,"Okay, So now that you know there are spoilers, I will assume if you are reading this, you watched the film.

This film was AMAZING. I stopped watching the trailers somewhere after the 3 minute ""you are not alone"" trailer was released.

I grew up with Superman, He was a superhero that I always loved to watch. I Loved his flight, I Loved his laser vision... but most of all, I Loved his weakness to humanity. With all his power, the inability to save everyone hurts him most... and we saw that.

We saw just what superman would do for the good of humanity... We saw how far he would go for us. He made the conscious decision to Break the neck of the only other remaining kryptonian on earth. That is what I wanted to see in superman.
I've always thought ""well what if Superman had NO choice?"" and I was always given ""there's always a choice"".
Well with Zod, there isn't and I finally saw what I NEEDED to see.

Lois Lane wasn't carried by the plot. She wasn't a damsel in distress. She knew what to do and when to do it, her moves were deliberate. She didn't just get 5 minutes to ask an irrelevant question then required to get saved. She actively did her job and found out who superman was... DIRECTLY tying her into the story as being the only person who knew who ""kal-el"" really was. ""Lois Lane knows who he is!"" I LOVED it.

The film stood on its own. It paid homage to its predecessors, It respected its roots, but it took a step out of the boundaries for the sake of keeping the ""man can Fly"" dream alive.

Seeing Superman stand under the beam from the kryptonian ship, I saw glimpses of Christopher Reeve... I don't know if my mind was playing tricks on me, but it made me feel as though I was seeing an old friend be immortalized.

There were inconsistencies, there were some things overlooked, but you cannot deny that after watching the film, they put a LOT of thought and a LOT of care into this film; I feel like the film was done with Love.


The Superman I saw today is the superman I've wanted to see since I was a child. Absolutely NO expectations broken, NO disappointments, The film was Amazing.

9/10. (I had to hold back 10/10 because of the few inconsistencies and things overlooked)",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,1371304871.0,,beyond,True,t3_1gdhj0,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1gdhj0/where_do_i_belong_a_superman_fan_weighs_inspoilers/,
1371132087.0,44,self.superman,1g9n7u,Opinion Piece on the Rottentomatoes ratings,UrbanGimli,55,11,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1g9n7u/opinion_piece_on_the_rottentomatoes_ratings/,"Here is my opinion of what is going on.  Critics are resenting the tonal shift that has happened to the story/character.  The Donner films, to their credit, gave the world a Superman who was a throw back to the sitcom fathers of the 50’s and 60’s. He was squeaky clean without a trace of irony. He was Earnest in a way that didn’t make you resent him or become suspicious. 

The movie was released in the late 70’s a time not too dissimilar from our own in that our country felt like it was on the brink. The industrial sector was in decline, Vietnam was still fresh in the minds of everyone, gas was expensive due to forced shortages, even water was being touted as something we had to conserve (Not that we shouldn’t –but this was the start of the Earth day/save the planet talk) Political corruption (Watergate) was still fresh in the minds of everyone. The cynicism of the time was expressed during the exchange between Lois and Superman on their date when he said he was for “Truth, Justice and the American Way” and her response was “You’ll end up fighting every elected official in this country”   That caused laughter throughout every theater in the country.  

So anyways, that’s the Superman that is ingrained into the public consciousness. An optimistic  perennially hopeful, stalwart paragon of unflinching, smiling conviction. 

For nearly 20 years Superman the Movie was THE Superhero movie you had to beat. Burton went a different direction that hasn’t held up the way Superman did. Some might say it was style over substance.  Nolan gave us a batman stripped down to its barest essence, a minimalistic approach that clicked with the movie audience. I think by the third movie the constraint of working in the “real world” of that universe began to wear thin and they gave us flying hovercrafts, collapsing football fields, nuclear bombs, and robot knee braces that repair years of damage.  Marvel stuck to their comic philosophy- Being a hero is fun, these are humans under the costumes, sit back and enjoy the ride. They embraced the popcorn with their films.

So now, in our era, where cynicism is high and irony is something we consume with breakfast everyday –To have a Superman that is as self-doubting and struggling as the rest of us hits too close to home. The critics wanted more Fred MacMurray and Less Stranger in a Strange Land meets Into the Wild. 

Remember in the 70’s movie Clarks transformation from overwhelmed farm boy to pleasantly self-assured crossing guard happened during a montage of space school, Marlon Brando style. 

This movie’s version of Superman doesn’t get there so cleanly or effortlessly.  I think the Critics are having a hard time dealing with the loss of that amused Superman. They were perhaps wanting another chance at having a Superman of their generation who inspired with a smile rather than fisticuffs. I say we were long overdue for this version if only to show another side of the character. This Man of Steel might grow into the more relaxed and self-assured smiling  Father figure, but we’ll just have to wait and see. It might not happen though. The DC universe is more expansive, more severe, and less forgiving than Marvels.   Again, this is just my opinion.

1371666844.0,43,self.superman,1go6gj,"To the people complaining about MOS's controversial ending: (1) It was wholly appropriate, and (2) it also happened IN THE COMICS. Out of character? Nope, it's right there in the canon. (SPOILERS within.)",Spyder_J,65,22,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1go6gj/to_the_people_complaining_about_moss/,"I think it's great that Superman killed Zod.  Sure, Superman would never kill in 99.999% of circumstances, but if we want to have any twinge of realism to these stories at all, we have to acknowledge that there are conceivable situations where these characters would just about HAVE to break their own rules.  All MOS did was present one of them.

Lots of things have been offered up in response to that now-infamous scene.  Some have said that Superman could have put his hands over Zod's eyes (hurting himself, but still saving the family) and kept the fight going, or that he could have flown them both out of the building.

This is all true.  However, he had Zod at a disadvantage, and the above solutions would prolong the fight and--in the case of blocking the heat vision--actually DISADVANTAGE Superman.

Think of the chance Superman would be taking in prolonging that fight.  What if Zod won?  He would kill Superman, no hesitation, and then make good on his threat to rampage his way across the Earth, killing every human he can.  Billions would die and human civilization would be utterly laid waste, because with Superman gone, no one could stop Zod.  How could he possibly take that chance?  Yes, Superman is good and a paragon of virtue, but only a fool would play around with Zod at that point.  Much, MUCH too dangerous.  He really didn't have a choice.

On the other hand, suppose he DID keep the fight up and eventually won.  Zod is unconscious and defeated at his feet.  Well, then what?   You can't restrain him. Even if you find a way to somehow cage him using leftover Kryptonian technology or something, what if he gets loose someday and kills Superman? It's ""Goodbye, human race"" all over again.

This isn't the DCU--at least, not yet.  There's no cavalry, no Captain Marvel or Martian Manhunter to swoop in and pick up the fight if Superman falls.  There's no super-prison with psionic blocks to cancel out caged criminals' powers.  Zod had stated flat-out that he had nothing to live for and intended to spitefully do as much damage as he could (which is A LOT) to the people of Earth.  He HAD to be killed.  There were no other options on the Earth of that movie.

What's more, Superman made a similar determination in the comic.  For over 20 years of the modern era, the current DC canon was that Superman executed the 3 Kryptonian villains from the Phantom Zone.  They were the only people he had ever killed.  He was haunted by it and didn't take it lightly at all, but he did it.  This is why I don't understand how so many self-professed purist super-fans--including even Mark Waid, who definitely knows better--can claim to be so scandalized and betrayed by Superman killing Zod.  This is nothing new, and it's not an obscure event or an alternate interpretation.  This is DC gospel, chapter and verse.  It is NOT some undreamt and unheard-of violation.

Now, there are some things to criticize the film for.  This, however, is not one of them.

I wouldn't say it's ""the best superhero movie ever,"" but it's definitely in my top five. 


Some people are complaining about all the action, but I think it's sufficient action that only Superman could handle; Batman would have been screwed. 


I loved the fresh take on the whole story, yet it stayed close enough to still be the Superman origin story we love.


I think this is the first time that a movie has really captured what Clark went through growing up and gave him real substance.


There is little to no comedic relief (as many have pointed out) but that didn't bother me. I think what this film ultimately does, is put Superman toe to toe with movies like Batman or Iron Man. It proves that his character can deliver what people want.


In the end, I think this movie was a fantastic first act to a two part story. I am really looking forward to the next one (which was green lit even before the official opening of this movie). Forget ""movie critics"", Superman fans should not be disappointed.

I would not call myself a huge comic buff but I know a bit. What I take from the Superman comics is what he represents and the whole truth and justice is something I try to live by, sometimes I fail but other times I don't.

Near my public housing (projects) is a neighborhood of aesthetic Jews. I was going to a dungeon and dragons thing down by the south side of Brooklyn. In this neighborhood kids walk and run freely, idk why and I rather not scrutinize the parents on how they raise their children. There was a group of young children on the corner playing and a younger girl I'm the middle of the street yelling at them happily like they were playing. 

I heard a engine approaching and by the sounds of it it was going fast and I saw it when I turned. A small minivan burning rubber down the street. Before I knew it I had already left the sidewalk and in mid stride heading to the little girl. I grabbed her and right when I thought I got her out the way the car passed and I felt part of it wizz passed the back of my hoody. It did not stop and when I turned it was turning the corner, I couldn't get the license plate.

I tried to tell the little girl to go home but she didn't speak English and was kind of scared someone not from her culture grabbed her. I'm guessing what seemed like her older sister grabbed her and went into a house and I was left walking to my brothers friends house which was close to the DND event. I was a bit shaken up when the reality set in that I could have died and by the time I got to see my brother and his friend. Was sweating and shaking. I told him what happen and he started to laugh which is always scary for my brother to do lol jk. He told me to look at my shirt. I thought I was bleeding or something so I looked immediately scared until I saw what he was pointing at. I forgot I put on my favorite Superman shirt.

I started to tear up immediately and cry a Lil when my brother hugged me saying I always knew you'd be a hero to someone.

To explain again I look up to Superman, even if he's a fictional character. He as a symbol is a hero. After seeing my shirt and what I did I was happy ; I did something I always wanted to do' save a life. I always thought I'd chicken out but I surprised myself and I'm happy I did. I wear that shirt with pride now and I'm sorry if I sound boastful in this but you can't blame me for being so happy about this. :D",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,,True,t3_10r5he,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/10r5he/i_felt_like_a_hero/,

So after several minutes of arguing back and forth, I finally shut her up with this simple fact.

Batman is human yes, and does amazing things with the resources he has, but that's just it. He does what he can to help as many people as possible.

For Superman it's different. He has the ability to save everyone on Earth, but he has to make a conscious effort of who to save. He can hear everyone's screams and calls for help, he could be in China in one instant, and American in the next. 
But even with this incredible power, he has human nature in him and wants to try to live some what of a human life. 
So whenever he chooses to sleep, eat, socialize with friends, go into the daily planet, he doesn't have too. He has to live with the fact that he won't save everyone. He does play God. And he has to live with that.

That's why Superman is the greatest hero. He holds the biggest burden of all. The ability to save anyone, but the reality to only save some of them. ",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,,True,t3_14e65n,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/14e65n/the_single_reason_why_superman_is_better_than/,

My nostrils flared and i could barely hold back my anger after what i had heard. People have become so complacent in this age and just recycle the same bullshit rhetoric that has become so commonplace about Superman. The person then went on to argue that they could relate better to Batman as opposed to Superman. My response was simply ""oh really?, you watched you're parents get murdered in front of you, inherited billions of dollars, went on a martial arts sabbatical, and fight the nastiest psychos in the city?"". The whole point of a hero or a villain is that their situations are usually so extreme that they are not something an average person could ever relate to in any context. Well save for the more general aspects like heartbreak and so on a so forth, but the point stands. I don't think many here can relate to Hal Jordan, or Aquaman either. So whenever i hear the Superman rhetoric, I just want to smack them around a few times.

He's one of my favorite characters and arguably the most iconic character ever created. I didn't really believe anyone could do him justice in a movie. A lot of my friends who have only seen the movies and never read any of the comics all think he's a boring character and I didn't want my mental image of him spoiled. The Man of Steel trailers however looked so good that I decided I had to see that one in theaters. Being the person that I am, that meant I needed to watch all the others in order first. I know I'm way behind the times but I have to get my reactions out there somewhere.

Superman: The Movie-Absolutely amazing. Reeves did a great job and Brando's performance as Jor-El blew me away. Krypton's crystalline tech looked sci-fi enough that it was believably futuristic. The effects weren't great but they didn't really get in the way of enjoying the movie.

Superman II-It was okay. I loved Zod's performance, as well as Ursa's. Non often strayed a little too much into comic relief territory but the three of them were pretty cool overall. I wasn't a fan of the whole ""give up your superpowers to live a life with a mortal woman"" gimmick though, he's an alien, not an elf! Despite the good performance of Reeves and Stamp, the final fight scenes between Superman and the others suffered from the poor special effects (and as mentioned in Family Guy, the weird cellophane logo that he throws at Non). It really didn't feel like a battle between beings with god-like powers, it wasn't fast or loud enough.

Superman III-It was funny, I'll give it that. Richard Pryor is a good comedian. Felt a little too silly for a Superman movie though. The red-K (which was still green for some reason) was a cool twist but Reeves plays a better good guy than a strangely non-violent bad one. Not great overall, the supercomputer made for an interesting villain, albeit very briefly.

Superman IV-A few redeeming qualities but the majority was just weird. When Lex decided to make a clone, I assumed it would be Bizarro instead of the unfamiliar Nuclear Man. Dealing with the very real issue of nuclear weapons made for an interesting story, but they really didn't discuss much human resistance to having their nukes stolen. That would have been more interesting than watching him fly around after Nuclear Man cleaning up after him for so long. And what was with reassembling the Great Wall of China with weird blue eye-beams instead of super-speed? I didn't get that.

Superman Returns-Great special effects and camera-work compared to the previous movies. I liked seeing him fly faster. The story was okay too, not very original but simple and to the point. Brandon Routh wasn't bad and Kevin Spacey was even a little better than Gene Hackman in the role of Lex in my opinion. I was a little surprised that it wasn't a reboot but that fact has made me look forward to Man of Steel even more.

So overall I'd rank them 1, 5, 2, 3, 4 in terms of quality. Can't wait for number 6! ",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,,True,t3_1cccdj,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1cccdj/i_finally_broke_down_and_watched_the_superman/,

1358717154.0,34,self.superman,16y62m,My treatment for an awesome Superman video game,skinsfan55,38,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/16y62m/my_treatment_for_an_awesome_superman_video_game/,"Well, I'll leave the potential awesomeness up to you. Anyway:

SETTING: The game is set in the present day with a heavy influence from Birthright. It's shortly after Superman arrives in Metropolis, the Kents are still alive and there's still some distrust regarding Superman, but all in all he's well received. The majority of the story takes place in Metropolis (and surrounding areas, maybe an upstate NY vibe) and Superman has the option to fast travel to the Fortress of Solitude (some puzzle solving with information/artifacts he gets from game missions) or he can fast travel to Smallville. Make a huge, Just Cause 2 style map. There's no invisible walls per se, when Superman flies to a boundary have a fast travel screen pop up. 

PLOT: The game opens with Lex Luthor announcing plans to launch a satellite network of some kind. The goal of this network is to better mankind in some way but it turns out a shadowy figure (who we know as Brainiac) is supplying Luthor with alien technology. This technology creates a barrier around Earth that filters out the yellow sun radiation that gives Superman his powers. Luthor (portrayed as a xenophobe) is distrustful of the alien and begins making his own preparations to destroy Brainiac once Superman is eliminated. 

In order to distract Superman from their plans regarding the satellite launch, Brainiac opens the doors to the Phantom zone. This of course releases many Kryptonian prisoners, with Brainiac and Luthor intending to eliminate them once the launch is complete. General Zod leads strategic strikes and commands rogue Kryptonians around the map, releasing classic Superman villians as he goes to keep him busy. 

Doctor Hamilton helps invent a hand held device to send rogue Kryptonians back to the phantom zone. One by one the Man of Steel defeats them, uses Doctor Hamilton's invention and manages to control the outbreak. 

Meanwhile, the launch is almost ready and we learn that Brainiac has double crossed Luthor. The technology Brainiac is deploying will allow him access to all the cumulative knowledge and scientific advancement of Earth and allow him the ability to destroy the planet. Luthor, a man of superior intellect was blinded by his hatred of Superman and did not truly see this betrayal coming. As Brainiac takes to outer space to employ his evil plans Lex Luthor is forced to begrudgingly aid assistance to The Man of Tomorrow in regards to Brainiac's weaknesses. Superman does battle with Brainiac, emerges victorious and the Lex Corp sattelites are destroyed. 

Luthor deftly manages to save face throughout the ordeal and manages to steal much of the credit for eliminating Brainiac and building further xenophobic sentiment among some people. Still, Superman becomes as popular as ever and the majority of folks accept him as a true hero.

GAMEPLAY: The majority of enemies are Kryptonian, thus, Superman can die, and does not need to throw his punches. As many of the Kryptonian army have minor exposure to yellow sunlight they are easier to defeat than others. Build the idea that as an infant Superman displayed some powers, but needed to work for years to develop them to their current levels. Some bad guys are overpowered because of concentrated doses of yellow sun radiation. 

The game would be an open world where missions come up to advance the story. Some are random events, some must be completed as Clark Kent and some as Superman. As Clark Kent you work with the Daily Planet staff and others to learn more about the satellite launch and the true purpose of it, as Superman you battle Kryptonians and send them back to the Phantom zone while gaining more knowledge about the alien technology being used. 

The Fortress of Solitude acts as a trophy room/area to consult Jor-El about the events of the game/analyze clues. This could be sort of like the Manor in AC3 or the Villa in AC2. 

Smallville is an area of importance as well. Say Kryptonains are drawn here due to the technology that exists from the crash. Superman must work with his parents, and friends from the local community. 

Have missions come up like GTA where you need to finish certain ones to unlock another mission strand. 

Environments need to be destructible, x-ray vision (like detective mode) would be a must to plan attacks/find hidden rooms and there should be an upgrade system. As Superman is new to Metropolis and is being truly tested for the first time he's pushing his powers to the limit. Say he begins having powers similar to the  Fleischer &amp; Famous Superman cartoons and he develops more powers and better tactics? 

CONCLUSION: Surely, there would still need to be a lot of work to make a good game. Solid controls, believable mechanics, smooth gameplay, but I believe this works out the issues with Superman's invulnerability... the powers would be slightly less than they are now... (upgrades could even allow more health. One such upgrade may be his cells changing to derive more energy from the sun.) and he'd have a super powered army to fight. 

---

If such a game were made, I think it could be a hit. Imagine Tim Daly reprising his role (in a darker way), John Noble voicing Brainiac (he'll be the voice for an upcoming animated movie), John Shea as Luthor, etc. It'd be an original story, like the Arkham games which frees it from the limitations of any particular DC establishment. 

So... if a game like this existed, would you buy it? ",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,supes,True,t3_16y62m,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/16y62m/my_treatment_for_an_awesome_superman_video_game/,

BUT it was so, so close and I'm very hopeful for the next one because the good outweighed the bad so heavily. Spoilers.",oaktownraider13,51,14,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1ge8ra/man_of_steel_was_flawed_and_failed_to_realize_its/,"First off, I loved the movie. Loved it, it had everything I wanted in a Superman movie, but there were two big flaws that it couldn't shake off, one of which was unavoidable. I feel like to properly review this you need to put the film in perspective, because it was truly unique.

My first issue with the film was that they simply had to do too much (not tried, *had*): Make Superman relatable to a modern audience, one that is used to the spectacle of Transformers, the charm and wit of The Avengers, and most importantly the quality of The Dark Knight. It had to accomplish this while staying true to the characters and the comics. 

It had to wash the bad taste that Superman Returns left in people mouths.

It had to satisfy its core audience, while also generating a new one that was already lukewarm to the character of Superman.

It had to become the next big franchise for Warner's after the end of the Dark Knight trilogy and Harry Potter.

A movie half as good would have been an impressive accomplishment considering the pressure that this movie was under. Had it not had so many things to satisfy, I think a more coherent story could have been put in the film, which brings me to my second flaw.

The flashbacks were handled poorly. I completely understand why they were done and why they were included and I had goosebumps watching them, but they way they were integrated into the narrative could've done with some fine-tuning. Rather than jump from one time in Clark's life to another, there seemed to be no sense of purpose to which flashbacks were shown when. I feel like you could have switched around any of the flashbacks in the film to where another was shown and the movie would have worked just as well, and that hurts the overall cohesiveness of the final product. I think an additional 5 minutes of runtime where they transition from place to place would have benefited the pacing a little more.  The last half of the movie takes places over the course of a day and the first half could be days, could be months. At ties it kind of felt like we weren't watching Clark become Superman so much as a montage of his life. It's a problem that may be bigger for some people than others and while it didn't take away too much from my enjoyment, it was definitely noticeable. 

Now, with that out of the way I can talk about the good, and there was plenty of it.

First and the most important was Henry Cavill. Seriously, he looked the part and completely sold the character. We are watching Superman, not some guy who looks like him. I love what the producers did with the character. Everything we saw, from growing up an outcast, to the bullies, to the vagabond life, to his inability to not help people, to his reaction to learning of his origins, down to his demeanor in the fights, just exudes believability. Faora even comments on his lack of confidence when fighting his fellow Kryptonians. She's telling something the audience already knows but it's not at all in-your-face because Cavill sells it so perfectly. It just feels perfectly organic and like an exchange that would actually take place between these characters. He handles his interactions with the different characters perfectly: you can feel that when he's speaking to the military officials he's not remotely threatening yet still letting them know in no uncertain terms that he is not to be fucked with, but with Lois he is a completely at her mercy. Just an excellent performance.

The action: Some people complained that there was too much action; I feel like this was compensating for Returns, like I was saying earlier. It could have used a bigger break between the fights but even so I loved it so much. This is what a Superman movie should have.

Amy Adams: She did an awesome job. I can see a lot of actresses taking on the role of Lois Lane. I can't see anyone else taking it on in this universe now that I've seen Adams. She had somewhat limited screentime but it was probably the finest example of ""more-is-less"" that I've seen in some time. Every scene she was in was just enough for the story. We didn't need to see every word of every conversation when she was tracking down Clark after the incident in the ship. We don't need a convoluted love story. Again, the romance between them was very limited but felt completely natural.

The Clark/Lois Relationship: While reading some of the reviews that said she was no more than a damsel in distress, I couldn't help but feel a lot of the understated aspects of her character's role in the story flew right over their heads (no pun intended) and it's been bugging me a lot. The film took great care to establish Clark as an outcast adult who had no sense of belonging his entire adult life, and only *then* does he meet Lois. When he first meets her she needs to be rescued. For the first time, one of his good deeds comes back to find him, and it's just his luck she's an ambitious journalist. So what does she do? The exact opposite of what any journalist ever would have done. And for the first time, Clark has an ironclad reason to give people as a whole a chance to accept him. I cannot overstate the effect this must have had on him. For as much a beacon of hope that he would eventually become, that was what Lois became for him first. You can see it in every interaction they have the rest of the movie. For Lois, Clark will always be this guy who A) saved her life and B) spent his whole life anonymously saving other people. Even if they never crossed paths again, their brief initial interaction would have permanently altered both their lives. The last bit about her character, I'll talk about later.

Jor-El, Jonathan/Martha Kent: I won't talk too much about them but once again the actors knocked it out of the park. There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said so I'll leave it there.

Zod: Michael Shannon more than holds his own. Within the context of the story he's a very tragic character. The story arc between Superman and Zod is very well done. Clark doesn't see himself as belonging to Earth until Zod shows up and shows him that he is most definely not a true Kryptonian either. Of course it builds to the controversial climax which is what I most want to talk about.

That ending: Superman isn't Superman yet, and I think a lot of people need to keep this in mind when talking about this scene. By the time Zod reveals himself, Superman is starting to find his sense of belonging on Earth thanks to his experiences growing up, meeting Jor-El as an adult, and meeting Lois. When Zod arrives, Clark is momentarily enticed by the prospect of rebuilding Krypton. For the first time in his life he sees an opportunity to not ""be alone."" When he realizes what this will cost ( the lives and civilizations of Earth) it removes any doubt as to where his loyalties lie and where home is. So by the final showdown, both Superman and Zod are at their physical and emotional limit: Superman for watching Zod destroy half the city and threaten then entire planet; Zod for Superman's perceived betrayal to his people and abandonment of his heritage by banishing the rest of the Kryptonian survivors. So when Superman has Zod in the headlock, and sees Zod so determined to destroy what he holds dear that Zod tries to murder a family in front of him, it is Superman that emotionally breaks first. This, to me, was the best and most important part of the whole movie. We see superman at his lowest. We see him sacrifice his only link to his kin to save someone he doesn't know. We see him completely break down afterwards. Superman is on his knees you can just feel him giving up, til he looks up and Lois is there. She witnessed the entire exchange and runs to him without a second thought. And this is why I feel the way the earlier part of their relationship was portrayed was so important. As I said earlier, I felt like Lois became to Clark what he would eventually become to the rest of humanity and because of that, Lois was the only thing in Superman's life that could possibly have pulled him through after what transpired with Zod.

Clark Kent no longer works at the Daily Planet after standing up against the new direction of the paper. Still a journalist, he gets talked into starting a website with fellow former Daily Planet staffer Cat Grant where he blogs news and she blogs about society life. He's kind of bitter about it, and makes jokes about how lame the website is. 

In a brief interaction with Cat he makes another joke about the infotainment site (named clarkcatropolis.com) before realizing something: Cat's coffee cup is empty (just a prop) and her shampoo is of a lower quality than she usually uses. He begins to understand that Cat has put everything she has into this website, and he feels instantly guilty about belittling it.  

Cat is a nuisance, she's flirty, she's not a hard hitting journalist like Clark, but she's a good person, and even Superman lost sight of that. I loved how they had him notice the little things before straightening up. It was a small scene, but it was poignant to me because even Superman forgot to notice the little things.

1373168198.0,35,self.superman,1hs9ur,One thing Man of Steel did really well...,Jim_Ballsmith,40,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hs9ur/one_thing_man_of_steel_did_really_well/,"Clark.


Looking at the mainstream on screen superman mythos (Donner films, superman TV (way back), lois and clark, smallville, [i.e. not comics]) There's always been such a difference between superman and Clark as if they are separate beings.  Clark, representing the best of humanity: humble, kind, caring, non-confrontational, gentlemanly (and often portrayed nerdy/dorky, lois and clark, superman returns and reeve).  Superman representing an ideal person or often the Christ figure (not human, but person): indestructible, confident, strong, voice of truth and justice (and sometimes reason).


With Reeve + Routh, he work the big glasses and was stumbling his words with Lois and going ""full human"" (if you seen tropic thunder, you know how i mean this). 


In Lois and Clark, Dean Cain played the character similarly... maybe just a more modern dork (watch the first episode and his interactions with Lois and Martha to see what I mean).


In Smallville, Clark was Clark and yet was reaching for superman.  It was like he had to *reach his destiny* and *become superman.* In Smallville it was like gaining enough XP points to level up, or transform into a whole different person or being. Smallville did resonate a lot with the Donner films, and we almost wanted to see him become the Reeve's superman.  As the viewer, I found myself wanting him to be superman, and no longer Clark. ""When's he gonna fly? When's he going to put on the suit and *be* superman"" etc.


Man of Steel stands alone and does what it needs to as a re-imagining of the character for a broader, new audience.  When it comes to Clark and Superman: he is one in the same.  Clark is trying to find out more about where he came from and who he is -similar to Smallville's journey, but with a huge difference.  In Smallville, Clark was almost nervous to become superman thinking he 'couldn't be that good', or he'll make mistakes and people will suffer. Smallville's Jor-el kept saying ""your not ready"" for like 5 seasons.  Basically saying, your not experienced enough, your not ready for this new level of awesomeness, you will remain grounded till I find you worthy and let you fly. 


Man of Steel is different.  Both father's encourage Clark to embrace who he ALREADY is.  Yes Jonathan wants Clark to wait to reveal himself to the world, but that's not saying ""your not ready, wait one more season till you get a suit and fly"" It's basically Jonathan trying to protect his son, which we see all the time in the mythos.  Jor-El was amazing and was upfront with Clark immediately about who he was.  He didn't have to work for it, or level up.  Clark IS superman.  He is one in the same. A man of two different worlds.  There is no leveling up, he is already superman and his abilities developed (all of them) as he grew up.  The way Cavill portrays both was great.  I loved the way he interacted with Martha and Lois, I love how he talked to the army, and I loved the final scene of the movie.  


[SPOILER] I am very excited for the next DC film, to see how they develop Clark at the daily planet.  Will he be pressured to ""act"" different?  Or will he remain confident in who he is, and be himself personality wise?  Obviously he hides himself with his glasses... but will he be a bumbling, super-ultra humble Clark? or the Clark we saw with Martha, on ships and oil rigs, making friends of old enemies (like the IHOP kid helping him up).  I absolutely love the WB animated films and STAS where Clark is a strong, confident reporter who even occasionally saves people as Clark still representing the best in humanity but not so distinctly different like Reeve/Routh.


TL;DR  I'm curious to where they go with the Clark/Superman dynamic but really enjoyed what they did with it and how Cavill portrayed Clark/Superman in MoS. Clark = Superman, they are one in the same.

For some reason I've never been able to connect with Superman the way I do with Batman. I've just always viewed him as a kind of giant rock that can't be hurt (unless someone has a green rock) and it just was never very relatable. He is basically invincible and I never saw how there could ever be any stakes in a story told about him. 

This movie did three things that made me able to relate

1 - It played up the sci-fi which is just a personal love (nothing I'm expecting anyone else to care for) and an angle on Superman I was aware of but never really appreciated till now. The scenes on Krypton left me wanting way way more of that

2 - It showed Superman as having a real choice to make and gave him a real hard decision to make. When the Zod fight started I was just like great here we go, invincible guy vs. invincible guy until someone gets captured or thrown into space or some bs but then Superman has to make a real choice and it gave real weight to the fight and made him relatable. Save a human or kill the last of your kind. Simply amazing. And the pain he felt after was palpable. Finally, Superman is human to me. 

3 - No hero worship. People are in awe of Superman without worshiping him. They act like real humans would, distrust and fear and while some are won over everyone knows that Lex Luther is gonna play on this big time. Most of Metropolis was destroyed by Superman and now he is in hiding. People are gonna do what they do best and that is react with close-mindedness, fear, and hate. Not everyone but a lot, and that is where people like Lex will have their inroad to gain power. 

All in all I loved the movie and this proves once again that DC is the super hero's for grownups.

How can the city recover? Here's 4 theoretical ways, and how they build into the developing story:

* **Lex Luthor rebuilds Metropolis** - This will, obviously, lead into Lex's presence in the sequel. It would also make him loved by the public, maybe even decreeing Superman to be an alien menace. He would probably use him as the reason why people in Metropolis died, much like Reddit criticises ""Man of Steel.""
* **Bruce Wayne helps the rebuilding process** - In terms of expanding the DCCU, this will introduce Batman and Superman. Wayne builds outposts for the Batcave within the new buildings, allowing him to have a base of operations. This would also demonstrate the ""World's Finest"" as a possible precursor to a Justice League film.
* **CADMUS is built from the ruins** - The government, pissed they can't just spy on Superman like anyone else, set up the division in Metropolis. On the surface, they are a government branch, but we all know the sinister underbelly to CADMUS. (If you don't, watch ""Justice League Unlimited."")
* **All of the above.** - That would just be epic.

Caution...this review WILL contain *MASSIVE SPOILERS*...Read at your own risk!



I know I'm late to this party. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it. Man of Steel has been sold out for the last several weeks, and watching it at the theatre in 3D (paying an extra ~$10 to boot) was really far from my mind. If I could watch it in 2D, I would jump at the chance.



On Sunday, this chance came; I rallied up my girlfriend, I put her in the car, and off we went to a showing of Man of Steel, in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, in 2D.



You couldn't imagine my inner turmoil at this point; have I been excited in vain? Will I be crushed and disappointed? Will I lose hope in a new, modern take on Superman? Well, critics already panned this film, so I was just hoping and praying that they were wrong, that they were too critical, that they didn't ""get it"" like they should have. With popcorn and drinks in one hand, and my girlfriend holding the other hand, we walked into the cramped theatre and sat down in the middle row to finally pass judgement on this summer juggernaut. What's my verdict?



Like I said, after reading critics' reviews and witnessing first hand the hostility that Superman fans have toward this film online, I was expecting this film to be truly terrible. A mere ho-hum that would scant be worth my $9.00 admission (well, $18: 2 tickets) Imagine my surprise to find that I could definitively state that critics were completely and unabashedly wrong on this one.



I never say this about a film, but I was literally gobsmacked. After watching this film, I can't help but concede this small fact: the movie garnered so much hate from critics because Zack Snyder rubs them the wrong way. From experiencing his takes on Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Watchmen, I know that Snyder makes movies that HE, as a fan, wants to see: he makes them from our perspective, and puts our wishes on the screen, regardless of what critics may think. I value Zack Snyder for doing this, for not cashing out and doing what critics want to see. At the end of the day, critics don't pay for the film, fans do, and I can say that he definitely pleased 2 with this film! Now, I can't say I blame critics for disliking Snyder, since he doesn't really have much tangible quality to his name, but it can't be denied that he really did Superman justice with this film. Whatever quality he has was streamlined and channelled into this cinematic experience. In my opinion, this kind of execution was exactly what Superman needed; because what is the world of Superman if not a world filled with action, lives to be saved, and tough decisions to be made.



While we're on the subject of tough decisions, for those who say that it was out of character for [spoiler](#s ""Kal El to kill Zod"")? It needed to happen. Why, you ask? That's very simple actually. It's because [spoiler](#s ""Zod was blood thirsty; he wouldn't stop terrorizing Earth until he died, he said so himself before he and Kal took their fight to the skies. ""This will end one of two ways Kal, either you die, or I do."" Zod would have incinerated that innocent family had Kal not stopped him by killing him. There was no other way to stop Zod, because now that he was gaining power from the yellow sun, he was just as strong as Kal, perhaps even stronger, since he was born and bred to be a warrior. Zod's suit served to hone his strength, and when he shed the suit, he was better for it, having years of experience fighting on Kal, with all his training with that immense weight of the suit on his shoulders."") Kal's choice was simple: [spoiler](#s ""let Zod kill that family and stand idly by, like he did when he let his father die, or step in and do something drastic. Also, this was his first romp as Superman; is it impossible that he would be slightly brash? Besides, Zod was a maniac who couldn't be stopped, he was a murderer, a tyrant, and a lunatic. He murdered Jor-El in cold blood, and admitted that he would gladly do it again. He wanted to exact mass genocide on Earth and almost succeeded. Is that not enough to kill him?"") For those who say that it shouldn't have been done because [spoiler](#s ""Batman doesn't kill? Well, in Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne let Ra's Al Ghul die for MUCH less than that, and no one batted an eye. You can say that Bruce let Ra's die and didn't physically kill him, but the whole scene with the train and the blowing up of the tracks was all his doing. Bruce orchestrated the entire situation, and then let Ra's die rather than save him. Kal did what he needed to do, and killing Zod didn't make me hate him."") As a matter of fact, it made me pity him, it made me feel how human he is, it made me like him for his faults and for his portrayal as a broken individual, rather than for being the epitome of perfection. For his entire life, Clark was forced by his parents to keep himself a secret; Jonathan and Martha damaged him psychologically, by forcing him to regress into his shell and not be himself. All at once, Kal was forced to abandon a lifetime of repression and embrace who he was and put it on a pedestal for mass scrutiny. He was thrust into being a hero without having time to prepare for it. And I think he did a damn good job with what he had.
Man of Steel was a thrill ride, and it was simply a great superhero film. If we could go in with open minds and not critics' expectations, we would enjoy films a whole lot more. Now, that's not to say that if you share a critic's opinion that you're wrong. That's not what I'm saying; after all, you're entitled to your opinion. I'm merely saying that personally, I really enjoyed this film. Snyder did a miraculous job modernizing Superman and making him relatable to us as a whole. I mean, xenophobia is a current and pressing issue, so why not explore it in the easiest way possible?



Plus, and let's be frank and not kid ourselves here, if the movie remained exactly how it is, and Snyder and Nolan's names were switched on the marquee, this movie would have had MUCH more critical acclaim than it presently has now. Names have a tendency to do that, unfortunately. And I can quite easily list another example if I needed to.



9/10 for me. It's as simple as that! It was a successful movie choice, and I for one can't wait until ""World's Finest""!",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,bizzaro,True,t3_1ivo41,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1ivo41/my_review_of_man_of_steel_and_my_response_to/,

However, one particular scene was problematic-- the tornado scene.  The movie showed people taking shelter from the tornado under an overpass, which is a good way to get killed.

A while back, some guys captured footage of being chased by a very weak tornado and they took shelter under an overpass and survived.  This footage was shown on numerous tornado shows (Discovery Channel, etc...).  The problem is that under an overpass is NOT a safe place to hide from a tornado.  In fact, it is one of the worst places to go as the overpass will channel the winds, making them stronger. http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ddc/?n=over 

After the amateur footage surfaced, several people have died taking shelter under an overpass.

I wish that the MoS writers would not have perpetuated the myth that people should run to an overpass if a tornado is approaching.

Otherwise, this was the Superman movie that I have been waiting for.",,False,self,t5_2qrwe,False,,,True,t3_1i3oe4,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1i3oe4/my_only_issue_with_man_of_steel/,

The main problem is instead of looking at the themes behind Superman, they are only looking at the main plot and characters involved.

Past movies have looked at the Superman ethos and said ""Well, there's Superman and he has these powers... and there's Lois and she's the love interest...then there's Lex Luthor and he's the villain..."" and then try to make a story around that. Along the way, Hollywood bastardizes everything that is core to Superman, and throws in stuff like a forced romance sub-plot, a kid to attract younger audiences, etc.

To make a good Superman movie, we need to look at the themes behind Superman taken from the comic books. Here is my suggestion:


**The Origin:**

This part is usually oversimplified in favor of moving the plot along, but it is essential to spend time on Kal-El's parents and birth because it will be a contrast to his existence on earth later on.

Krypton is a technologically advanced planet, and it's people favor scientific progress over emotional sentiment. They should be an enlightened race, yet much colder when compared to humans on earth. They live on a planet without war or turmoil, yet their undoing is caused by not heeding Jor-El's cry for restraint for a new form of energy, and Kal-El is sent to earth, as we all know.

The situation on Krypton should echo our current struggle for environmental preservation- but can't be too preachy- because that's annoying and is really secondary to the main theme.


**Earth:**

Earth should be a direct contrast to Krypton, where the setting and people are much more warm, but also much more emotional. The earth should be depicted in constant turmoil, with either war or corporate ambition being rampant across the entire planet.

Kal-El's adopted parents should be very warm and emotional. They raise Kal-El as Clark Kent and teach him morality, and how to live as a human. They also encourage him to blend in as a human and how to hide his powers.


**Powers:**

Clark's powers aren't simply a cool superhero gimmick, they should be tied into the theme of the story.

The stronger Clark gets, the further away from humanity he should become, both literally (as in flying above the city, above the earth) and figuratively (his power separates him from those around him, isolate him).


**The Antagonist:**

The antagonist in the film is not just someone for Superman to fight- he should be a foil to superman to represent his inner turmoil. That being said: Brainiac.

Brainiac is a relic of Superman's home planet. He should come to Clark at the height of his alienation from the people of earth. Braniac doesn't come to Clark as an enemy, but as a part of his lost culture. Brainiac re-introduces Clark to Krypton, by helping him build a sanctuary where he could be at home (fortress of solitude) and give him a message from his biological father.

The conflict comes when Brainiac wants to extend the re-introduction of Krypton to the entire earth, destroying the humans that enhabit it, and replace it with Kryptonian technology and life (he has genetic samples and knows the location of other Kryptonians).

Lex Luthor would not be THE antagonist of film, he would be in the background, but you would see many similarities between Lex and Brainiac.


**Conclusion:**

The entire film is an analogy for Superman's inner-battle between his birth planet and adopted planet. The antagonists' motivations in the film should be similar to the motivations of the Kryptonian people. Brainiac, Lex Luthor both would sacrifice people to advance technology for their own gain. In this way Superman is not only fighting against the antagonist but also against his own heritage, and trying to find a balance between his Kryptonian self and his human self.

Lois Lane would be in the picture, but she should not really even be a love interest. She would really be in love with Superman, the paragon- but then again, most of the earth would be. Clark would be in love with Lois' humanity and even a little jealous of it. She should be able to empathize with others in a way that he is not really capable of.

I recall when The Dark Knight Rises first started gaining media momentum, I was hooked on every bit I could find. I even went to watch Mission Impossible 4 in IMAX so that I could see the first 10 minutes of TDKR. However, after I had finished watching the movie, I felt like I had spoiled so much for myself through absorbing everything the marketing team had thrown out there. I thought the whole intro, the football stadium explosion, or even the big police/prisoners fight scene were moments that would have been better left for viewers to have discovered at first viewing.  

Anyway, flash forward to the present, and I've been committed to preserving the spectacle of the movie as much as I can. Besides, it seems like so much could be riding on this movie as Superman has not been done justice in the past by movies (The Christopher Reeves movies have their merit, but that's a different argument). So far, the only thing of Man of Steel that I have watched was the first teaser trailer shown at the beginning of TDKR. And it has been a struggle since I am a HUGE Supes fan, but I have to admit - it's really nice knowing nothing about the new movie. I haven't seen any new trailers, very few promotional photos that I couldn't avoid, nor have I read anything about it.

It is a big risk, removing one of the areas for future tension and plot lines. And to me, it was fascinating how FAST she found it out - emphasizing how good she is at her job. Perry even comments on it, indicating that if she had sources, she would be able to uncover the truth (when she says she is dropping it). Sitting in the theater this afternoon, when she walks up to Ma Kent as says ""I want to talk to you about your son,"" I was thinking, holy crap that was quick.

Second - Christ woman, keep a lid on it! After returning from space and getting dropped off by the cop, she runs up to him yelling ""Clark!"" within earshot. So much time is spent in Smallville, and Supes makes no secret that he grew up in Kansas. We were obviously meant to think there was some recognition between Pete and Supes at the IHOP.

(very minor spoilers below)

1. The latter half of the film gets excessive with the action. I tend to agree with this criticism. The *scale* of the action/destruction fit Superman well, which many critics fail to realize, but I agree that it got pretty relentless there for a bit. 

2. The second criticism I saw many reviewers complaining about which I *majorly* disagree with is the idea that the film was too serious and lacked humor. 

I saw one review that claimed the film didn't crack a smile until the Army officer ""thought he was kind of hot"" at the very end. On the contrary, there are many subtle moments of comic relief peppered throughout the film's first half that many reviewers seemed to intentionally overlook. The smashed truck, Lois' ""measuring dicks"" line, the timid priest, just to name a few. Yes, there wasn't A TON of humor, but I think many critics had their experience of The Avengers stuck in the back of their head, which to be honest, is a film that rarely goes two minutes without a moment of comic relief.

Man of Steel is a serious movie for the most part, and yes the experience can be jarring after years of lighthearted Marvel movies. But to claim that the film suffers for being *more* serious is just downright unfair.

I knew it would be and was correct all three days of IMAX were sold out.  It's a great way to get the feels that feel good.

This father and son were walking around the furniture store shopping (Jordan's Furniture has an IMAX theater attached to their stores it's pretty cool).  I stopped them and asked if they were going to Man of Steel.  They said no I asked if they wanted to because I had two free tickets.  The father said he wasn't feeling good (called out of work ill) but his wife who was in the rest room might be interested.  I gave them the tickets and said see if she is interested and if not please pass them to someone else.

Well I thought they might have skipped using them (sometimes I don't find out if people do).  After the movie they came up to me and thanked me, the father lamented he spent time a Pizza Hut because it was sold out.

I was stoked that some kid went shopping with mom &amp; dad and then got to see MoS opening night in IMAX.  It made me feel super man!

Moral of the story, try buying a few extra tickets a sold out show sometime you'll love being a hero to someone who wasn't expecting it.

 Again, it's ok if you guys don't want to do this, I know if I had the chance to see it on the 14th the only other thing I would want is to talk about it all day but I need to know if there will be spoilers or not on this subreddit so that I can unsubscribe on Thursday until I see it.

Spoilers within!",jaycatt7,31,10,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hq575/finally_finished_smallville_main_thought_during/,"And I *liked* Smallville. I mean, I watched all ten seasons, right?

OK, I know I'm about nine seasons off the re-watch group, but I needed to vent. The ending on this thing made me miss the writing on Star Trek: Voyager.

[spoiler](#s ""They made the audience sit through Lois and Clark's wedding vows."") Twice.

*Twice.*

Yeah. That was about the worst of it, but on the whole, the pacing of the finale was horrible. They spent so much time on wrapping up different characters' threads and showing us the seven-year flash forward that the actual resolution of the season's arc took about two minutes. [spoiler](#s ""Clark finally figures out how to fly and uses his finally discovered power to shove the impending threat away."") Deeply unsatisfying. After 45 minutes of Clark whining about whose son he really is and whether he and Lois really deserve to be together, the actual problem of the end of the world is barely an afterthought.

I did like the way they portray a future for Chloe and Oliver. Kara's send-off was lackluster at best. [spoiler](#s ""Oh, I have a noble destiny? Great! No, no need for me to time-travel-teleport there after helping Clark save the world, I'm sure he'll figure it out just fine on his own!"")

It's been a few days, so the details are fuzzy even though the urge to rant remains strong. I guess my biggest gripe is that the finale, despite its homage to John Williams and future scenes to show the audience everything works out--[spoiler](#s ""Perry White, not-Jimmy Olsen, Lois writing, Superman flying in costume"")--failed to give a satisfying conclusion to a series that had some strong episodes. They brought in so many other DC characters over the years and had some fun, dramatic, interesting plots. On the whole, this was a decent show. 

After ten years, Tom Welling has to have logged more screen time as Clark Kent than any other actor, right? That's a big part of the Superman story.  I guess I just wanted the send-off to be their best, and this definitely didn't deliver.

The problem is, Homo Sapiens have been pretty much unchanged for 200,000 years. But then again, the skull that contains the codex looks exactly like a pre-human, Homo-something-else skull. That has to be on purpose, right? 

Which planet did the ancient common ancestor of humans and Kryptonians start on? Could it be earth? 190,000 years is a pretty long time to get nothing done, maybe an early group managed to leave earth (with the assistance of some other alien race, like the Guardians from Oa) and settled on Krypton.

Highlights


* Jor El recounting Kryptons History - Soooo much story potential. Yeah, all the colonies failed...or did they

* During Jor Els recounting of history the icon representing Clarks rocket looks like the 70's rocket (spikey)

* The picture of Christ in the garden of Gethsemane behind Clark in the Church as he weighs his decision to turn himself into Zod.

* It was clear to me that Zod wanted to die and forced Clark to kill him as his parting punishment. Death by Superman.

* Krypton loves tentacles.

* I want Faora to come back.

* I thought the single camera shooting worked well in some parts and poorly in others. 

* Having the Kryptonian's knocked around by our military weapons was very cool. 

* Extreme use of their heat vision seemed to hurt them or make them dizzy

* The colors of Clarks suit seemed to change in saturation levels scene to scene.

* ""Welcome to the planet"" ..great line. It hits clark on so many different levels. Earth is his home now, Lois is part of that.

*  ""this man, is not our enemy""  I think Clark almost cried when he heard that

*  The casual destruction of the tracking satellite was a bit much

* ""General, I was raised in Kansas, thats about as American as it gets"" 

*  I felt like the same 3 musical cues (Flight, I will Find him, and What will you do when you arent saving the world)  were on auto repeat throughout the whole movie. I loved all 3 but I would have preferred more variation

All in all, I enjoyed it. I hope it makes mad bank and we get another MOS fast tracked for 2015.

Lex,
Zod,
Evil Computer/Businessman/Richard Pryer,
Lex/Nuclear Knock-off-man,
Lex and the Emerald Isle,


Really? Is that all Hollywood has for Supes? Lex is a great villain but overused... Would it be so bad to have a movie that wasn't ""Oh, hey Lex."" ""Oh, hey Superman."" ""Imma stop you now."" ""Imma whip out my Krytponite."" etc, etc, etc. There are a good number of villains in Superman's world to make for a great movie. Bizzaro, Brainiac, Metallo, Parasite, Darksied, hell I'd even settle for a little Mr. Mxyzptlk on the side! Isn't it about time we got a movie where he could punch someone through a few buildings? Not that I just don't love seeing him use his super strength to lift things and stop cars/trains/whatever is crashing at the time. What villain would you throw against him? If you had to do a trilogy of movies what order would you do them?

Me, I'd probably do something like:

By moving extremely fast, the girl seems to disappear and walk through walls. Clark learns that Emily's father has been cloning her, with the help of green meteor rock. The flaw with the Emily clone is that she has no sense of morality, which eventually puts Lana in danger. Meanwhile, Lex prepares for his wedding with Helen.

However, I did have a few issues with the film. I've listed them below:  




- Although the fight scene between Zod and Superman at the end of the film was a visual spectacle, neither character looked as if they were in any danger of being hurt, nor did they express any pain. This robbed the scene of any tension and made them (especially superman) unrelatable.







- I was a bit disappointed that Superman didn't (directly) save many people in the final act. It was awesome when he destroyed the world engine, but it would have been nice to see him stuck between fighting Zod and trying to save people from falling debris/buildings.




  


- I think that they should have shown Martha and Pa Kent before they found Clark's ship. I don't think that Martha was developed at all during the film and it was difficult to sympathise with her. In the comics (If I'm not mistaken) Martha badly wants to have children, yet she is unable to conceive. I would have really liked it if the film had addressed this, and shown how much Clark meant to them. They should have also touched on Martha's grief after Jonathan died.  


  


- I think Clark was a bit too reckless in this film. His actions during the fight in Smallville could have led to many people dying. During these scenes, he flew Zod through a Gas station (blowing it up in the process), and takes Faora (an extremely powerful, sociopathic alien) into an ""i-hop"" in which several people were present.    




  

- In my opinion, the film didn't contain enough humour.  

   


Having said all of that, I really enjoyed the film.

 

I'm not expecting your answers to be as long as mine, I'd like to see what the rest of you think.

1364405278.0,18,self.superman,1b4d6a,"Newcomer FAQs: ""What stories should I read? What's MoS about? What are some great Superman TV shows? Is Superman too powerful?"" PLEASE READ",gothamite27,20,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1b4d6a/newcomer_faqs_what_stories_should_i_read_whats/,"* Is Superman too powerful?

In any fictional story if one character has a gun and the other characters don't, wouldn't the gunman be the most powerful man in the world? 

Three ways to get around this are:

- Give the gunman a challenge he CAN'T overcome with just his gun (maybe his loved ones are in danger and he doesn't even know straight away). Give him a challenge that requires his intelligence and a strict adherence to HOW and WHY he's using that gun. 

- Find a reason for why the gun doesn't work (Kryptonite, Magic, Red Sun, etc). 

- Introduce a character with a BIGGER gun. 

The first option is how the best Superman stories are told. The second is how many Superman stories are told. The third is how most Superman stories are told. Superman is not too powerful. He has simply been too privy to a lack of imagination from bad writers and lazy readers. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________


* Is Superman too GOOD?

Any character whose nobility is greater than others could be perceived as 'too good'. Interesting stories are found when Superman's world is much like our own (dark, uncaring, filled with cynicism) but he himself is the 'light that leads the way'. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________


* What is 'Man of Steel' about? Is it going to be really dark like the Batman movies?

Man of Steel is about an alien raised as a human being who discovers that he has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men and how he tries to find a way to use those abilities to help all of mankind. It's the origin of the Man of Steel for a new audience. 

Writer David Goyer and star Henry Cavill have REPEATEDLY stressed that it is not a 'dark' film by any means - merely a more realistic take on the character, meaning the world around him is much like the increasingly cynical world we live in, but the character is much the same, simply that he has more difficult, humanising decisions to make as a result of his environment. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________


* I didn't like Superman Returns. Should I bother going to see 'Man of Steel'?

Yes. Superman Returns had nothing to do with this new film and the new film looks like it's going to be everything fans wished Superman Returns had been. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________


* What are some great Superman stories I should read to get to know the character?

Some of the most accessible Superman stories basically just retell his origin. Unlike Spider-Man or Batman, there are tons of these for Superman because people are constantly trying to come up with a new feel or spin on the same story. 

GREAT ORIGIN STORIES:

- Superman: BIRTHRIGHT

Birthright is the best Superman origin story ever, because it asks the question ""What would happen if Superman happened in real life?"" All of the modern-day cynicism and mistrust is present in the story, but Superman is the same optimistic hero he has always been. An extra level of detail and depth goes into developing the Clark Kent secret identity and the story actually makes the concept of glasses-as-a-disguise quite plausible. The story isn't perfect and I have some problems with its final act and its characterisation of Lex Luthor, but overall I think it's a terrific Superman story and many friends of mine who aren't into comics found it superb. 

- Superman: Man of Steel:

Man of Steel was the 1986 miniseries that revamped Superman and streamlined his origin for modern comics. It's fairly dated now, but it introduced some excellent elements that stayed in the comics for years afterwards, adding extra weight to Clark Kent's role as a reporter, his relationship with Lois and making his powers a bit more palatable (they 'depowered' him a bit, so while he's still phenomenally strong, he can't move planets etc). A very good book.

- Superman: Secret Origin

Secret Origin has some very good characterisation, but it's a bit syrupy and as a story, it's only okay. Geoff Johns made the unwise decision to bring back Clark Kent's childhood adventures as 'SuperBOY' which a lot of people don't like and find silly. 



BAD ORIGIN STORIES:

Superman Earth One

- I thought Earth One was quite awful. It excessively darkened Superman and made him mopey and unlikable. I sincerely disliked it. 


OTHER GREAT STORIES:

- All-Star Superman:

I don't really need to give this any introduction. A mammoth superhero epic written with wonder, affection and trippy weirdness by Grant Morrison. If you're new to comics, I don't reaaaally know if you'll take to this straight away, but see through the first few issues and you're bound to love it. 

- Kingdom Come: 

Think 'The Dark Knight Returns' but for Superman, with beautiful photorealistic artwork by Alex Ross. An absolute triumph by Mark Waid. 

- Red Son:

What if Superman landed in Russia? An excellent effort by Mark Millar. 

- Superman Adventures

Also written with care and affection by Mark Millar (a lot of them, anyway), these are a collection of single-issues that contain some of the best Superman stories I've ever read - superior in their simplicity. If you have a young child and you want to introduce them to Superman, go no further than these stories. Absolutely outstanding books that I would show to aliens who'd never heard of Superman.
____________________________________________________________________________________________



* Isn't glasses a bit unrealistic as a disguise? Could that work in the new film?

Read Superman: Birthright. In that story, Mark Waid fleshed out the disguise by incorporating an elaborate acting method Clark uses to differentiate himself from Superman. The glasses distort the colour of his inhumanly-blue, notably beautiful eyes and with the addition of baggy, nerdy clothes and a less prominent posture, Clark is able to convincingly make himself appear like an entirely different person. 

Grant Morrison went even further with this in 'All-Star Superman' by explaining that Superman can actually contract his spine to physically make himself appear shorter as Clark - he also relaxes his muscles to appear flabbier as Kent and taut/ripped as Superman. When Clark's glasses are knocked off in one issue, Lex Luthor can't even recognise that it's Superman.

Either of these approaches could work excellently in a new film. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________





* What are some great Superman TV shows?

Superman the Animated Series is quite good, but sometimes it doesn't embrace the character enough. It excessively depowers him and removes a lot of the familiar traits of his personality. It's still a strong series that does good work with the mythos. 


Smallville is the story of Clark as a young man and while it started off promisingly enough, it descended into absolute utter shite that continually disgraced itself and its efforts to humanise Superman. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________


Lois &amp; Clark is a great, under-rated Superman and very similar in concept to 'Man of Steel' - Clark is an everyday man with an extraordinary secret, going through the motions of big-city life, buying a new apartment, falling in love with a co-worker (Lois Lane), etc. However, he's also the most powerful man in the world and he has to find a way to consolidate his life as Superman with his life as a mild-mannered news reporter. It's a very good series - cheesy at times (it was the 90s, after all), but very much worth a watch, particularly the first two seasons. 

____________________________________________________________________________________________


The Adventures of Superman is the classic black and white Superman show that became colour in its third season. Starring George Reeves (no relation to Christopher Reeve), it treated itself a lot more seriously than the Adam West Batman show did and it has a lot of what makes Superman great in the early episodes - however it got quite campy in the colour episodes. The best episode of the entire series is probably 'Panic in the Sky' which was remade a couple of times both in the comics and in other Superman shows (Superboy, Lois &amp; Clark and the final episode of Smallville). 

____________________________________________________________________________________________


'Superboy' is an oft-forgotten 80s/90s live-action series that has Clark become a superhero in his late teens while attending Shuster University. It's quite different from any version of the comics, and it's extremely low-budget and very, very cheesy with some horrible acting at times. It's definitely worth a watch if you're looking for a B-movie version of Superman though and there are some really strong episodes (Mine Games and 'Roads not Taken' are quite good).
