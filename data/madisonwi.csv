As some of you may have seen from the front page, Google is getting into the ISP and Cable television business with a boom. Basically, they're offering neck-breaking speeds at penny-pinching rates that anyone would be crazy to refuse.

Many probably remember our bitter failure to bring Google Fiber to our wonderful town just two years ago, so I was hoping that I could at least spur the meager number of readers we have here to pre-register for Fiber so that Madison can perhaps have one decent ISP in a few years. All you have to do right now is input your gmail and zip code and once a certain threshold of the population signs on (probably 25% for Madison), we are on the shortlist for Fiber.

So take a second out of  your day, and pre-register here:  http://fiber.google.com/about/

I am a 2002 UW Madison graduate and grew up in Wisconsin.  I just returned to my residence in the south from a business/vacation trip.  This was my opportunity to show my fellow coworkers what Madison is all about.  I want to say thank you.  Everyone was blown away at how clean the city is and at all there is to do.  I was really sad to leave at the end of my time there and can't wait to return again.  I want to share some of the pictures I took.  I only got around campus and the Capitol, but the foliage, harvest fest (you'd burn in hell before seeing that in the south), and the one man band just reminded me of how much I love this city, because no matter who you are or what you like, there is something for you in this town.  I will always be a Badger.

On, Wisconsin!

Last Monday at about 11:30 in the morning, while on the way to a final exam at UW-Madison, I was in a traffic accident with an ice cream delivery truck at the corner of First and Johnson Streets.  I didn't call the police since I had to get to my final.  The driver of the truck seemed cool and gave me his insurance info.  When I tried to submit my estimate for repair, I found out that he is saying that I ran into him (he actually backed into me).

If you or anyone that you know happened to witness this and could contact me by pm, I'm sure that there would be never-ending real world karma for you.

-An Important Update to Our Supporters-
Dear Xxxxxx,
Early this afternoon, United Wisconsin's website www.unitedwisconsin.com, was the victim of a cyber attack. It appears this attack may be ongoing. Our web team reports that this attack was coordinated and deliberate.
The attack, which is known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack, flooded our servers at approximately 2:00pm. At this time the source of this attack is not fully known. However, we are reporting this to the FBI and Wisconsin Attorney General, and taking all the steps we can to ensure this does not happen again.
Clearly this was done to deny the people of Wisconsin access to the recall Walker materials United Wisconsin is trying to provide.
Despite these efforts to again stifle the people's voice, United Wisconsin and its partners are not shaken. The efforts to recall Scott Walker and Rebecca Kleefisch are continuing as planned.
It is our intention to continue as planned to provide you with a link to the recall petitions just after midnight tonight. Please bear with us as we attempt to fix this problem. Some external pages associated with our website are still up and running, and are not affected by this outage.
In the meantime, should you need to contact United Wisconsin please email PR@unitedwisconsin.com.",,False,,t5_2r8rz,False,,,True,t3_mci1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/mci1o/at_2pm_today_a_ddos_attack_was_launched_on_the/,

Last year we hosted Global Reddit Meetup at Vilas Park and I think most attendees agree that this is an excellent location for this year's event as well.  

We had a pretty impressive spread last year, but I want to take it up a notch. More food, more beer (no bottles), more board games, more field games, more charismatic pets, more grills, more photos, more redditors, and I really hope more toilet paper. *shudder*

For everyone who expressed interest in the recent I-want-to-make-friends posts, this is a great opportunity! I've made a ridiculous amount of friends through this subreddit. If you're a SAP or nervous about going to these things alone, feel free to PM me with questions or for reassurance. I'd be happy to share my experience about how these things go down and how to get the most out of them. 

The [Capital Lakes DragonFest](http://www.capitallakesdragonfest.com/) will be going on til about 4pm, so the park should be pretty happening. Parking might be iffy, but shouldn't be terrible.  We'll have better identification than we did last year. 

[Info on the park](http://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/parks/park.cfm?id=1365). Again no bottles, but alcohol is okay.     

[Here](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/global-reddit-madison-meetup/) is our very informal redditgifts meetup page. Let's keep most of the discussion here, but at least the rest of reddit will know we exist.

Meetup&amp;subreddit veterans, help me out - more ideas? Is the bouncy castle thing happening? Anything not mentioned here that you want to see happen? RSVP and mention something you'll bring so we can get a feel for what we can expect/need.   

My fruit salad lasted all of one hour last year, so I'll bring that again, along with drinks, maybe some grilling stuff, though I have no grill. I'll try to think of more stuff.

One was taken to the hospital and was verified to have ghb in their system. 

Seems trip be a disturbing trend in the area. According to a friend it is the new ""thing"" in the dubstep scene, even though no one I know has anything to do with dubstep.

Global Reddit Meetup Day is in five weeks so put a note on your calendar, take off work, and start thinking about what you want to bring / do this year to make this event another incredibly memorable day.   

[This is one of our group photos from last year](http://i.imgur.com/OmMO0h.jpg).  

[Here is an entire album of the great food, fun, and good company](http://imgur.com/a/66CZj#VOSSw)  

Let's do it again! Success is up to us. Bring a dish to pass around, non-bottled drinks are welcomed, and all the field games, card games, and whatever fun activities you want to share. Last year we had wiffle ball, a slackline, cards against humanity, touch football, an unexpected magician, homebrewed beer and a ridiculous amount of food.    

[This is a link to Vilas Park information and map](http://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/parks/park.cfm?id=1365). There do not seem to be any other events that day.   

In addition to consumables, we also need people to bring lawn chairs, grills, plastic/paper eating utensils, paper towels, garbage bags, etc. A roll of toilet paper isn't the worst idea either.     

We usually start around 1pm and pack up as the sun goes down. Folks who aren't quite done partying usually head to a bar downtown afterwards.  

This post is to get the ball rolling. Further discussion will follow. Please share your ideas, concerns, rsvps, suggestions for making this better than years in the past, etc. I'd especially like to hear input on what to do if it rains considering we've been very lucky the last few years.

I've compiled a list of all the temp agencies in Madison (I could find on google) and I'd like to share it with you.,StarPower1,63,11,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1j3xia/attention_jobseekers_ive_compiled_a_list_of_all/,"I'm on the hunt, myself, and I always got the sense that temp agencies were the best way to get a foot in the door of Madison businesses.  So I went ahead and compiled the list that I had been telling myself I was going to do for over a year now.

You can apply online to most of these agencies, but some of them require you to send/fax/present a paper resume.  Some companies have their own job-posting website (thingamajob.com for Aerotek).  Some companies are sister to each other (Aerotek + TEKsystems).  You'll see that some have contradictory location information.  Google and the actual company website had discrepancies, so I noted both.

Keep in mind, just because they're often called ""temp agencies"" doesn't mean you can't get long-term or permanent work through them.  They often have temp-to-hire positions available and can sometimes do direct-hire.

I recommend being on the roster of at least 4 companies that have the kind of work you'd like to do.  That way, if one company isn't able to fit you with the right position in a short amount of time, the others may.  I've been surfing temp agencies for a little while now, so if you have questions, ask away.  **If you have input or recommendations about temp agencies, you should totally talk about it down below.**

I recently purchased an inexpensive guitar online (sx furrian, rondomusic.com) and had forgotten to update my shipping address to my new apartment, since I rarely order off of Ebay.

The guitar was delivered to my old address, but wasn't there when I stopped by to look for it. When I contacted the landlord (Cliff Fisher, who once drunkenly crashed his plow into our house) who insulted me and told me he had shipped the guitar back to the sender, but when pressed for the shipping address spelled out F-u-c-k-o-f-f and hung up on me.

I contacted the MPD, and Officer Dailey worked with me to get the guitar back from my house and my belligerent former landlord.

I have always been wary of the police (had 1 or 2 bad experiences with small town cops and county sheriffs when living in Whitewater) But the professionalism and willingness to help that was displayed by Officer Dailey was a very pleasant departure from the usual conduct I have experienced in the past.  This experience, plus the conduct of the police at the protest/uprising in 2011 has really changed my outlook on the police, well, the MPD anyway.

TLDR:

I made a stupid mistake, and Officer Dailey helped me get my guitar, even though he didn't have to.",,False,,t5_2r8rz,False,,,True,t3_12ipqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/12ipqf/good_experience_with_the_madison_pd/,

He offered buffalo robes to freezing legislators and promised choice Madison lots at discount prices to undecided voters.  
The city is named Madison for former President James Madison, who had just died around the time they were looking for a name for the city.  Doty named the city. He also named streets for the other 38 signers of the U.S. Constitution. (washington, hamilton, etc)  
The population of Madison in 1846 was 626.  
Madison was the capital and a city before Wisconsin was a state.  
The capitol was laid in 1837, replaced in 1863, and burned in 1904. The currently capital was built between 1906 and 1917.  
Camp Randall was used as a training camp, military hospital, and prison camp for captured Confederate soldiers.
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, thousands of students and other citizens took part in anti-Vietnam War marches and demonstrations, with more violent incidents drawing national attention to the city and UW campus. These include:
•	the 1967 student protest of Dow Chemical Company, with 74 injured;
•	the 1969 strike to secure greater representation and rights for African-American students and faculty, which necessitated the involvement of the Wisconsin Army National Guard;
•	the 1970 fire that caused damage to the Army ROTC headquarters housed in the Old Red Gym, also known as the Armory; and
•	the 1970 late summer predawn ANFO bombing of the Army Mathematics Research Center in Sterling Hall, killing a postdoctoral student, Robert Fassnacht  
The Onion, a satirical weekly, was founded in Madison in 1988.  
The capitol dome is the second tallest in the nation, after that of the capital in Washington, DC.  
Madison has several nicknames/slogans, including: Mad City, Madtown, the Berkeley of the Midwest, 77 square miles surrounded by reality, the Athens of the Midwest, the People’s Republic of Madison, Four Lake City, Lake City.",,False,,t5_2r8rz,1348780352.0,,,True,t3_10iwp7,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/10iwp7/madison_fun_facts_please_add_and_share/,

** canned_spaghetti can provide rides from the east side..see this comment **

** ONE THING WE MAY NEED IS TABLES....IF ANYONE CAN BRING EXTRA TABLES, PLEASE DO SO!  I WILL BE THERE AROUND 1:30 TO SET-UP AND CLAIM A SPOT **

So, Global Reddit Meet-up day is less than a week away, so it's time to make our finalized plans.  First of all, read the original post at http://redd.it/uhhc8 for a quick overview. 

Now, for the new stuff and a summary:

* **Time:** Saturday, June 23rd @ 2pm
* **Place:** Vilas Park (Extremely Approximate Guess of Where We May be In Vilas Park - http://goo.gl/maps/lVoq)
* **How to Find Us:** If no one steps in and offers something better, I will print out a fairly large reddit banner on a plotter.  So, look for a group of people with reddit logos and excessive amounts of beer.  Numbers will be posted closer to the events for those desperately lost.
* **Is Alcohol Allowed?:** YES!  However, no glass is allowed!
* **More info on Vilas Park:** http://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/parks/park.cfm?id=1365
* **Reddit Gifts Page:** http://redditgifts.com/meetups/global-reddit-madison-meetup/

**What to Bring/What Others are Bringing**

This will be a potluck event, so if you can, please bring beer, alcohol, food, bouncy castles, adorable pets, etc.  Last year we had so much alcohol that even with 100+ people, we couldn't finish it all.  So, people who bring food will be awesome!  On that note, please comment what you will be bringing so people have an idea of what we need still.  I will periodically update this post to include a list of what everyone is bringing (if you are brining solely beer, for the sake of the list not getting cluttered, I won't add you here...sorry).

I received an e-mail back that seemed promising until it said 

""As soon as you can, please click the link below and go to the secure website to complete the free credit report (takes about 30 seconds)
Once you complete, I'll call you once I receive the information from the credit company (very quickly usually).  Once you fill out the report the credit company automatically forwards me your name, email address and whether you have had any outstanding evictions in the past 5 years to determine your renter eligibility. This is the only information I am interested in. This is a soft credit report so it won't touch your FICO score (which is why we work with them).""

This is a SCAM.  I have advantage of working for a property management company and contacted one of the site managers asking what he thought.  He said that eviction records are not shown on credit scores.  Also-it's customary for companies to run their own credit check and he has never heard of it being done like this.  Nowhere in the e-mail does it state their company name, address, or office phone number.

Of course, the link is down now but I thought I'd get the word out if anyone else is apartment hunting.  This is how you get your identity stolen.  My guess is you submit the ""report"" and then never hear from them again.

The e-mail listed in the ad was: zywijyzixeliq@hotmail.com but e-mail address that responded was rosalindacrawford404@hotmail.com.  (Unrelated-who still uses hotmail?!)

Also I forgot to add that she could only give me the address of the building after I submitted my credit report because of ""safety reasons.""

I have been practicing and I am now confident enough to offer the service to the public. 

I can put a polished razor edge on any blade that isn't serrated. This includes kitchen knives, pocket knives, axes, hunting knives and any sort of tool that you need a blade cleaned up on. 

I am thinking I would charge $5 per blade with a $20 minimum. So bring me your blades, tell your friends and let's get those things ready for the winter cooking season! I could also probably pick them up and drop them off it was an ongoing thing or people were willing to chip in a bit for gas. If you work in a restaurant or know a hunter, let them know.

I cleaned the apartment from ceiling to floor and re-painted all of the walls that they asked me to. They also listed me as not paying my latest bill as one of the reasons - which is entirely false.

The question is, what can I do? Where do I start? I need my money back.


Also, no one should ever even consider Springtree Apartments (Middleton) if you're looking for a place. The apartments are nice, but the management will screw you at every opportunity.

To be clear: They sent me an itemized list. It's just incorrect.
For example, the deposit was $775, but they listed it as just over $300. They also included in my ""fees"" that I didn't pay my last 10 days of rent, which is false. I have the check stub to prove it.They also told me that I would not be charged for painting as long as I put the first coat of paint on to speed the process. I was charged $54. They patched a 2"" by 2"" square of carpet (this was legit, a pen broke.), but they charged over $100 for it.

P.S. Thanks for all the advice. I've written reviews and a letter informing them that they do, in fact, still owe me a lot of money.



P.S.S Some of you have said that you also had trouble with Springtree. I would encourage you to follow the advice of Krackor and write reviews of your experience to deter others from having the same problems.

1348011166.0,37,self.madisonwi,103uzp,A Friendly PSA: Friends don't let friends use AT&amp;T,AnxietyMan,45,8,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/103uzp/a_friendly_psa_friends_dont_let_friends_use_att/,"My story starts a while back when I finally finished school and moved into an apartment. Seeing as it's the 21st century, I decided I only needed internet and got AT&amp;T DSL (5Mbx1Mb). Had my own modem (from a thrift store), was paying around $20/mo, and the service was reasonably solid. All good.




Well then I moved. I called AT&amp;T about the move and they informed me that DSL was not available in the area, but I could get U-Verse internet for $15/mo and a free (with rebate) modem since mine wouldn't work with U-Verse. I didn't know how U-Verse internet differed from DSL, since they both go over the phone line and use PPPoE, but I took them at their word as I have little knowledge of WAN technologies.




First problem: The service took *over a month* to get turned on. I had the modem within 3 days, but it took over a month for them to do whatever magic needed to be done to make it actually connect? Whatever.




Second problem: After waiting ages for them to turn on the service, the modem still wouldn't connect. A technician arrives on the scene and, after verifying my signal was good, proceeds to replace the modem. We go through *three* of the goddamned things before we get one that works. For the record, the technician was swell and I have no complaints about him.




Third problem: My speed is only 1.5Mb/768k. Ugh. After calling AT&amp;T, I discover that this is the maximum speed available in my area. Fine, whatever, it's tolerable and the rate is low. I'll fucking deal.




Fourth problem: First bill is twice what I was quoted. Called, got it corrected, all relatively straightforward... Except I have to do it **every single month** enduring constant promises that it will be permanently corrected *this time*. Eventually a young woman informs me that it is the correct rate, the promotion I was offered was in error, and she would not correct it.




Fifth problem: I **never** receive my modem rebate. Every time I call about a billing issue I mention it, and they promise to get it taken care of. Spoiler: It never fucking happens.




After a few months of this, I set up $30/mo 30Mbx5Mb service with charter and call to cancel. I'll never forget the conversation:

Her: ""Blah blah blah, what can I help you with today?""

Me: ""I'm calling to cancel my service""

Her: ""Excellent""

And we proceed to have a nice chat about how I was fucked over, why it probably happened (poorly educated sales associates apparently), and whether or not I'd consider coming back if things improved. At the time I was feeling alright because we were having a pleasant chat, so I said yes, that was possible. She then credits me for the rebate I never received, informs that they're sorry to lose me as a customer, and that's that.



About two months later, AT&amp;T finally mails me the check for what they owe me from the credit...



**Sixth problem:** I haven't even had a chance to cash said check yet and today I receive a bill for nearly $50 from Assholes, Tossers, and Twats. ""Early Termination Fee"" it's labeled. I never had a contract of any kind and was never told that there would be such a fee. It wasn't even hinted at.




Since I can't reach them after working hours I'll have to call tomorrow during work to see if I can get them to correct this, but I doubt it will work. I'll end up paying it because I like keeping my credit pristine and I honestly just want to never hear from AT&amp;T ever again at this point.




And that, my fellow Madisonian redditors, is why I will never purchase a service from AT&amp;T ever again.

1316562315.0,33,self.madisonwi,km52h,For those of you who need any heating or A/C work done please stay far away from All Comfort Services.,citking,38,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/km52h/for_those_of_you_who_need_any_heating_or_ac_work/,"I posted the main story on Yelp but I thought it might be prudent to let others in the Madison area know some more specifics. 

This past spring I won the Click and Bid auction on Madison.com for a $4,000 a/c unit and I won the auction for getting my furnace cleaned and inspected. For the services I paid less than $2,800. 

The owner himself, Kendall Richards, came out and did the preliminary inspection. I also wanted to get some upstairs duct work done so he looked into that as well. The inspection went well though he did suggest getting a newer furnace would make the job easier. He would send me a quote and we would go from there. 

He sent me a quote that had prices near $6,500 and $7,500 for a couple of different furnace options. He also then told me that things like running the electrical to the A/C unit and running the plumbing necessary for the A/C unit (drain hose from the inside coil) were ""extra"" even though they are both pretty necessary when considering a new A/C installation. 

My wife and I, who are planning on selling our house soon, did not want to dump this much money into it. So I called Kendall back and stated we would go with the A/C we had won, the electrical and plumbing work, and the ductwork to the upstairs for a total of about $1200 (also quoted by him). 

He then changed his tune and told me that, upon further inspection, my ventilation was not up to code and that, in addition to a new furnace I would now needs a new power-vented water heater. The furnace he insisted on replacing was vented to the roof along with the water heater which is OK as far as code goes. In fact, All Comfort Services were the ones who put it in to begin with so now he was kind of contradicting himself - did they install the furnace against code 8 years prior or is it up to code and now he needs to make up for the difference he is losing in the auction? Also, no code violations were found during the initial home inspection and the homeowner's insurance inspection.

What I ended up doing is hiring a home inspector (different from the one used when I purchased the house to prevent charges of impropriety) to look everything over again. He came, looked, and told me what I thought - there was absolutely nothing wrong with the venting at all. Furthermore he told me he has had others in the Madison area tell him that All Comfort Services had tried to pull bait-and-switches on them as well. 

This was what I had at the time so the wife and I decided we didn't really want any more services from All Comfort Services, especially if they were unwilling at this point to do the work (Kendall's own words). 

So I wrote Kendall an email about a refund and he agreed initially. After a week or so of no communications from him despite several calls and emails I eventually had to file a dispute with my credit card company to get my initial money back from the auction. 

Sorry this is so long but I just wanted to share my story so that perhaps I can prevent you from wasting a bunch of time, money, and energy doing business with this unsavory company. 

tl;dr: Don't do business with All Comfort Services. They bait and switch and stop returning emails and phone calls when you ask for your money back because they won't do the work that they promised.

""I just voted in Monona, and the two guys ahead of me both had little slips of paper with a name written on it as a write in.""

There are other signs too.  Since she's unopposed, and this is the only thing on the ballot, a write-in candidate would have an easy time.

District 48 includes most of the east-side of Madison, and runs down through Monona, McFarland, and Blooming Grove.

There is a speed trap between Waunakee and Middleton on Hwy Q near North Lake every day. 

I don't normally mind this kind of activity, but the amount of time being spent on this speed trap is immense. It may be that Middleton police officers are sticking nearby after being encouraged to ""protect"" the rich neighborhoods of North Lake and Bishops Bay from the poorer folk in Arbor Lakes and the other apartment complexes. Also, this is about the farthest possible location from the Middleton police station in the entire city. Officers hiding out while on duty? It just seems a little odd.

Anyways, the Middleton police are spending at least 40 man-hours every week to catch speeders along a road with no cross-streets and no sidewalks until near Hwy M/Century. That, I cannot stand.

**Potluck Frisbee Alcohol Consumption Extravaganza** 

**Saturday, June 25th**

**Pending Start Time: 4:00 p.m.**

I left the voting thread open for a few weeks so anyone who had an opinion could hop on and I got two main ideas:

Vilas Park

Union Terrace

I am going to just call it as Vilas even though it was pretty much deadlocked by what I read. Sorry if I'm pissing off approximately half of you. 

Reasons:

- Easier to find a spot for a (hopefully) large group, considering our seating will mostly be blankets/lawn chairs/ other movable shit.

- Rumor has it booze is okay so long as it's not in glass.

- More underage friendly

We will not be reserving a shelter. That just seems like a mess waiting to happen. I know I can't front the reservation costs and I wouldn't ask anyone else to put their money and name on the line for a bunch of internet strangers. Even if we are some pretty awesome strangers. 

I was thinking a potluck deal might work out well. I am not sure on the grilling aspect of it though, does anyone have any knowledge of grilling rules/ whether or not they're enforced? I don't actually know how we could do a headcount for this, so I think that if you want to bring a dish or snack just post what you will be bringing and make a plentiful amount.

If anyone has a couple foldout tables I think that would help with setup too. 

It was mentioned in the last thread that a tent structure of 10 x 10 or bigger requires a permit, BUT if you have smaller camping like tent structures we could probably use those. 

I hope we don't run into hassles for being a ""party"" because really it's just a large gathering. We can all pretend to not know each other if we are accused of such things. Which shouldn't be hard considering most of us don't know each other. 

If there is bad weather there is a backup plan: meeting up at the terrace! Or another bar or building, but I'm assuming the terrace love is still ongoing. I will pay attention to the forecast in the week before and hopefully all is well.

Sorry if I'm missing anything. If there is important stuff I'm overlooking then yell at me angrily and I'll update it!

I hope to see a lot of you there! Holy shit there are almost 1000 of us now.",,False,,t5_2r8rz,False,,,True,t3_hllvm,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/hllvm/final_meetup_post_probably/,

1374274926.0,32,self.madisonwi,1inw6f,"If you're a motorist, DO NOT STOP for pedestrians and bicyclists at the intersection of West Washington Ave and the Southwest Commuter Path!!!",plus,59,27,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1inw6f/if_youre_a_motorist_do_not_stop_for_pedestrians/,"Edit: As a clarification, I am a bicyclist/pedestrian in this scenario.  I do not even own a car!

Edit 2: A few people seem to be in a hissy about me giving ""bad advice"" due to a misinterpretation of my title or my post, so a few clarifications.

1) I am not telling motorists to run over pedestrians.  Obviously.

2) Motorists are *not* legally required to stop for pedestrians or bicyclists who are waiting to cross (in a position where they will not be run over, obviously) at *this particular* crosswalk.  Rihatsu pointed me at this:
http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/IV/24
which I believe is the same law FatBikeFanatic keeps beating me over the head about, and it only refers to uncontrolled crosswalks.  If you scroll up to 346.23, you will see that at controlled crosswalks, motorists must only yield right of way to pedestrians/bicyclists who have begun to cross, or who have been given the signal to cross in the case of streetlights.  This is a controlled intersection, because it has stop signs for pedestrians and bicyclists.  Therefore, motorists do not need to yield right of way, and should not be expected to, so pedestrians and bicyclists should cross at their own risk when a car in one lane has stopped for them.  I personally will continue not to!

Today, I saw someone get nearly run over by a car because he started walking across W Washington at the Southwest Commuter Path intersection after a car stopped for him (on the train tracks, no less).  The thing is, W Washington is a four-lane street, so there are two lanes of oncoming traffic, and a car in the other lane did not stop for the pedestrian because they could not see him, because their vision was obstructed by the stopped car (on the train tracks!).  Now, you might argue that the oncoming car should have stopped once they saw that the car in the other lane was stopped, but the thing is cars are not supposed to stop there anyway!

There may be a bit of confusion because there are lines painted in the road to indicate where cars are supposed to stop, but those are actually for when a train passes.  This should be obvious to cars that are driving west down W Washington, since the lines are pretty far away from the Southwest Commuter Path crossing.  Despite this, I see cars stop for pedestrians and bicyclists (myself included) all the time, going both directions, and every time I get (possibly irrationally) upset because of how stupid and unsafe it is.  It's unsafe for pedestrians, because cars are not supposed to stop for them, and one car stopping in one lane might encourage a pedestrian to cross even though cars in the other lane either don't know to stop for the crossing pedestrian because they CANNOT SEE THEM. It's unsafe for motorists, at least westward, because they end up stopping on the train tracks (!!!).

Usually what ends up happening is a car stops, pedestrians and bicyclists start to cross, and traffic backs up because guess what, pedestrians are slow.  Or, a single car stops for me to cross even though there are no other cars in sight and if he had just kept on going I would have been able to cross just as easily without delaying the car, except I refuse to cross in that situation because I don't actually have the right of way and I'm more afraid of getting run over by someone than I am of having to wait an extra few minutes, so we end up staring at each other until the person in the car decides to finally stop being an idiot and go and by that time traffic has finally caught up so I need to wait for them to pass and hope none of them try to be ""kind"" and stop to let me cross.

I'm sorry for this long rambling post, but I bike to and from the office every day and this happens far, far too frequently.  This is exceptionally annoying because the motorists should know better, they should know not to give way when they do not have a stop or yield sign (they certainly don't do it for other cars at normal intersections!), and they should know not to stop ON THE TRAIN TRACKS.  I know that other intersections on and around campus have signs that say motorists should yield to crossing pedestrians, particularly on Langdon near Memorial Union, but W Washington has no such sign and is such a busy street that yielding for pedestrians is just not tenable.",,False,,t5_2r8rz,1374345433.0,,,True,t3_1inw6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1inw6f/if_youre_a_motorist_do_not_stop_for_pedestrians/,

I usually go for a jog around Hoyt Park everyday. Today I got delayed so I wasn't able to go out until 8:45 pm for my jog. When I stepped out of my house a white kid probably 16 and an Asian kid probably also 16, both of them fully dressed (jeans/button up) were running full speed down the road. I kind of brushed it off as them messing around and so I began my run. I noticed a lot of teenagers on their bikes riding around kind of eyeing me, didnt really think much of it.


Then all of a sudden two older guys (probably both 18) come running down the street on the opposite side of me. They see me and cross and take off at a full sprint toward me. I slow down to a jog and just stare at these two guys thinking what the fuck do they want I literally have nothing on me, I'm jogging for fuck sakes. As one of them gets within 5 feet of me I stop, he slaps my arm and yells 'got ya' and laughs and then runs off. I'm just standing there what the fucking. 

I decide to keep going and 2 minutes later a car speeds passed me and some guy yells at me 'HEY I GOT YOU' and then speeds off. 

At this point it's completely dark outside and I just decide to head home. As I'm going home 3-4 teens on bikes start riding near me, so I am just like fuck it, my jog got ruined, so I take off sprinting. I manage to lose the kids on the bikes and get in my house and post on Reddit.

I have been jogging all week and nothing weird has happened at all. So I'm just curious if anyone has any ideas? Was it just some kids messing around? Was there some party or something that ended in a big game of tag? ",,False,,t5_2r8rz,False,,,True,t3_xlkr0,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/xlkr0/what_the_fuck_just_happened/,

The service base license is required because you need to have a commercial kitchen wherein you prepare your food and ingredients for the day. Food carts aren't allowed to actually cook food in their carts but just reheat and assemble ingredients that they've prepared earlier at a professional kitchen that has passed health board certification. Food made from home kitchens is prohibited.

So my question is for those who don't already use food carts as an extension of their restaurant (negating the need for a service base). What places in Madison allow you to cook and prepare food for the day? Is there something like a community kitchen? Or do you have to rely on someone you know who has a restaurant and will let you use their facilities?

We should have a meetup!

I was thinking about a weekend in December, I know a lot of us are busy around Thanksgiving and this weekend is a little short notice. 

A Saturday in December anybody? Downtown would probably be best for everyone because of it's central location. Any ideas for bars or restaurants? 

EDIT: Alright, it seems like The Great Dane in Hilldale is an overwhelming favorite. It is a bar for those of us who can drink, but they let underage people in to eat/ play games/ possibly sneakily drink?. 

I live on the far east side but I am completely down for going out there for the meetup, and if anyone needs a ride I can probably scoop them up. 

I think that the two best dates from what I read over would be Dec 4th or Dec 11th, which are both saturdays. So vote? Also, a ballpark time?

Edit 2: Maybe if everyone just sends me their votes for the day time in a PM i can gather the data and post? Unless someone has a better idea... a comment in this thread maybe?

EDIT THREE: So everybody has been throwing in their two cents and here's what it seems is best- 
Saturday, December 4th 
The Great Dane Hilldale   5 pm

I will try and get there earlier and maybe reserve an area for redditors/ make a sign so we can find each other. If anyone else who is closer to that area could maybe help that would be cool. I've actually never been to that Great Dane.

The bus line shoots straight to Hilldale mall from downtown, by just taking the 2. If you are allergic to buses there are multiple redditors who can probably pick you up. Message one of them who say they can do so in this thread. 

Although I've never been here, multiple redditors have said that this place is underage friendly, especially earlier. 

I am going to post a new thread for this now that it's all figured out.

My dog escaped today from my apartment complex near Mineral Point and Yellowstone. Tore through the screen door and jumped from the 3rd story and ran off. (seriously? 3rd floor..)

He is a Shiba Inu, tan, 27 pounds. Looks like a fox. Not aggressive but wily. 

If you catch him or see him, please contact me at (415) 269-6471. Thanks all. 

And if anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to better find him, let me know. This is the 1st time for me.

**UPDATE: ice_floe and another very nice caller point me to my (probable) dog getting caught and staying at the Dane County Humane Society.**

THANKS so much for pointing me to this. I spent the last couple hours posting up flyers.

I had also gotten a call from a very nice woman who works at a shelter who confirmed to me the stats of this dog and it matches very very well with my dog (along with where he has been sighted and where he was caught).

I've left a message with the Humane Society and will hopefully talk to them tmrw to confirm that this be here my dog. 

All signs point to yes. Thanks so much. I just moved here to Madison and I gotta say in general and specifically the people here are just nicer and more helpful. My kind of city! &lt;3 Will update on if this really is my dog or not. Hopes up? yes! If he isn't, I'm going to get crushed emotionally.

**Potluck Frisbee Alcohol Consumption Extravaganza** 

**Saturday, June 25th**

**Pending Start Time: 4:00 p.m.**

Now that we have the date and time all set and everybody is sufficiently excited, I have a few things I wanna throw out there that have been brought up to me:

* Charcoal and gas grills are fine- which means I am recruiting people who have them to bring them, also people willing to bring meat, and people willing to grill. 

* Music- Wiguy posted a link to amplification permits. It said nothing against boom boxes/ portable players. I'm assuming theyre okay so long as they are not classified as a stereo system, amp, p.a., etc. I also think that guitars or other instruments would be fine and encouraged.

* There can be NO alchohol in GLASS. All other types are fine. Mini kegs, kegs, cans, whatever so long as it's not glass and we clean up after ourselves. 

* I would like to do something cool as a group to commemorate the event. If there is a good photographer out there we should get a group photo. Although everyone is free to have whoever with them, I think it would be nice to have at least one redditor-only photo. In addition to this, maybe a giant reddit card? We could all sign it and try to be witty and shit. 

To finish this off, here are the results of the impromptu headcount:

* Alydy0y0 +1           bringing trees and pineapple
* Krusten                 bringing Fruit salad/ maybe veggie pizza
* Nipzzz +1 bringing something baked
* loki00 bringing sushi style BLTs 
* Mleitch bringing dessert and A GRILL
* Akatch bringing apple pie
* Nerull
* zylphite +2 bringing frisbee discs
* neko bringing dessert
* iinekimaani +1 
* zerotimestatechamp bringing frisbee, friends, chips
* Sylocat bringing lemon bars, pie
* Wiguy bringing/ making kabobs
* genki831
* poorariel
* movingon11 +1
* cbbloodletting bringing washoes, a fuckton of chips
* coveritwithgas bringing awkwardboner
* sellyberry bringing sushi style BLTs
* markawilson86 bringing a smile
* pancititito bringing brats, hotdogs, frisbee
* jondercin bringing A GRILL
* dloverde +1 bringing a lurker
* mendota
* DrBaracktopus 
* Fantum49 bringing baked goods and stuff
* wuvwuv bringing mac and cheese
* CrimsonQueso 
* reddit_isgay bringing heroin
* x98x
* moldovamina 
* genki831
* event_horizon bringing famousness
* applecola +1 bringing excitedness
* sylocat
* MoaRider
* spiker611
* EkOnomic +2 couple cans of furious and basil with or without preperation
* Ezekiel375 bringing supper club and hopefully a guitar
* timtheinchanter bringing creepiness
* greaseinthewheel
* FlyingParadox
* schostyscholar bringing a nasty surprise
* ttagggttaggg bringing cards, a frisbee, and some fruit

This list is ~~ 25 34 41~~ **54** people total. I just wrote down and transferred whatever anyone said from the last update thread. 

If you aren't on here or are on here and want me to change something just leave a message or shoot me a pm and I will update. I guess we can kind of use this as our headcount estimation. The more accurate the better guys. 

I didn't list anyone saying they'd bring alcohol because this is how it's gonna roll: bring enough for yourself to drink for sure, and enough to share if you are an awesome person with spare funds. 

In no way do I promise that this will be the last update.

Our apartment management company, MPM told us that we need to move out into a hotel for a week or so, and return to them with a receipt and they would take care of it. We were skeptical, so we typed up a document illustrating the agreement and had them sign it.
   Well, exactly one day AFTER we had checked into our hotel, they sent us an email saying that they had a check to reimburse anyone affected by the flooding (about 5 apartments total). However, we were already informed that our apartment received the worst damage, and therefore would take the longest to dry out and repair. The check turned out to be less than even half of the cost to rent a hotel room for the ten days they quoted us, while other apartments had far less damage and could return sooner, pocketing several hundred dollars from their short hotel stay. How can this be right? We are all full time college students without the time or money to deal with any of this right now, and they could have made the process easy, but they had to pull the rug out from under us right after they sent us out to drop some serious money on a hotel room. We are going to talk to them today to see if we can't work something out, but in the past they have always been pretty sketchy in terms of being completely honest with us.

We'll have some kind of sign indicating we're with Reddit, but I'll leave our info with the host(ess) so they know where to direct new arrivals.

[Here's a link](http://hilldale.greatdanepub.com/) to their website for more information. They have free parking.

It's more or less a straight shot, with a little side stepping, from Mickey's on upper Willy all the down to Main Street and over to Paul's on State Street. 

Obvious the bars are packed closer together the closer you get to State but for those who have time and a sense of adventure we could do most of that route.

I'm still crutching it at the moment but hopefully by the time we get something going I'll be mostly mobile.

So who wants in and what are your preferences? I'm up for most anything except sports bars.

EDIT: So no one is really expressing any preferences to where or when. Come on people, I can't do this all myself! :D

EDIT2: I'm starting to get a feel that a Saturday one or two weeks out from today is good? Is this correct. Also that we should start on Willy since the distance between bars is longer on Willy? Is this correct? I'm thinking start at Crystal Corner, skip Weary Traveler since the bar portion is small (unless people want to share some platters), maybe hit PlanB, hit Wisco, from there's it's a slug to Essen/Northwoods/Come Back In(same building), then there's Cardinal which we can stop at or skip depending on what event is going on. After that we can go up King St, hit anything we like such as Great Dane, then go down Main St. past the Capital to Genna's, possibly Shamrock Club and then Dise. From there it's over to State St and whatever our drunken selves can manage at that point! LOL

EDIT3: For those among us hesitant to stop at a ""gay bar' such as PlanB or Shamrock I would like to remind you lots of (Bi-)women like to hit PlanB but not Shamrock so much. ;) 

PlanB is huge and usually has good DJ's like LizzyT and they play good 'accidentally' rub yourself up against someone music, LOL.

So the first summer downtown/campus reddit meetup will be at the **Plaza**, **Wednesday**, **8:30pm.** $2 capital bottles. If there is fizzle/interest we might head to Old Fashioned for 2-for-1 drafts after 10:30pm.

**What?** Drinking and socializing if for no other reason that dammit why not. First controversial topic? PRISM and/or whether Bieber will eventually more likely OD or join Scientology.

I have blond hair and a red beard so I'll be hard to miss. PM me for my cell if you want.

**Next week?** This is a movable feast so next week is in the air, even up to doing something Friday instead of Wednesday if there's enough interest in that.

I hope everyone has been thinking about what they're going to bring and wishing for good weather.  [Original Post Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1e4ud6/save_the_date_madison_global_reddit_meetup_june/)  

**Where**: Vilas Park  
**When**: Saturday June 15th, 1pm


For everyone who hasn't attended one of these yet, it's usually a long day of hanging out at a great park meeting new people and enjoying a big potluck spread while the beer flows.   

So now I need everyone's help and input! Here's a little guide of stuff worth bringing:   
 
**FOOD**    

* Meats to be grilled      
* Veggies to be grilled
* Condiments
* Potato salad  
* Deviled eggs  
* Artichoke or spinach dip    
* Chips and salsa    
* Veggie tray with dip  
* Cheese/crackers/meat tray   
* Bruschetta  
* Hummus and pita  
* Taco dip  
* Salad    
* Cold slaw   
* Pasta salads    
* Finger sandwiches    
* Cucumber salad  
  
This is an opportunity to get creative! Show off your favorite recipe! I want you guys to blow my mind! Need inspiration?  

Check out /r/food, /r/recipes, /r/appetizers, /r/grilling, /r/Cooking!  

**DRINKS**   

 **No glass bottles allowed**   
**Kegs ARE allowed** 

* Beer  
* Soda  
* Water  
* Fun mixers / cocktails   
* Iced tea, lemonade, thai iced tea, etc    

Again, get creative!   Last year we had some very generous redditors share their homebrews with us. I'd love to see that again.

**LOGISTICS**  

* Tables  
* Chairs  
* Grills and grilling equipment  
* Blankets to sit on  
* Plates, plastic cups, plastic silverware  
* Paper towels, napkins, toilet paper  
* Garbage bags  
* Coolers  
* Reddit identification (banner, signs, I'll bring my flag from last year)    
  
**FUN STUFF**  

* Cameras - I want to see an obnoxious amount of photos.  
* All of your reddit / Madison / Wisconsin paraphernalia!   
* Frisbees  
* Boccee ball  
* Wiffle ball  
* Football  
* Slackline  
* Hackey sacks  
* Card games (other can expand on what they are brining here b/c I am not super familiar) 
* Hoola hoops  
* Bean bag toss  
* Horseshoes    
* Pets  
* Friends  
* Musical instruments if people feel so inclined   
  
 
Finally, some further questions to get the conversation started:    

* Anything we should organize? I've heard portapotty mentioned. What about games/competitions? Like a blindfolded beer tasting or something.   
* Are there any important events being celebrated that day? Anyone have a birthday? I know of one fantastic reddit couple celebrating their first wedding anniversary.  
* What the shit do we do if it rains?  
* Global reddit meetup veterans, what would you say to newcomers who might be nervous? Any favorite memories you'd like to share?   
* It's always appreciated when people rsvp and mention what they're bringing so we can take inventory and figure out what we'll need in the final days.     
* I notice other cities are advertising their global meetups with a banner on the top of the subreddit. How do we make that happen?  

Thanks!

1370624551.0,22,self.madisonwi,1fves7,Homeless man and City of Madison employee save suicidal woman's life at Monona Terrace,myekename,22,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1fves7/homeless_man_and_city_of_madison_employee_save/,"The City of Madison employee knew she must hang on, if she was to save the despondent woman's life. But she was also fearful: for if the woman did jump, she was likely to go with her. If that happened both would tumble an estimated 70 feet onto a concrete bike path below.

The chaotic scene was unfolding on an otherwise beautiful Monday, just prior to the lunch hour.

Many others were on the Monona Terrace rooftop, taking in views of Lake Monona while enjoying freshly planted spring flowers. Piercing the tranquility were the employee's cries for help. It wasn't a businessperson having lunch, or a tourist appreciating all that is Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architecture, that came running. No, it was a Good Samaritan named James, who happens to be homeless.

He saw the woman on the rail, trying to jump. He could also see the other woman, right behind the first, desperately hanging on; hanging on with all the strength she could muster. James, age 46, could hear screaming: ""Let me go! Let me go!""

He ran to both and helped grab onto the first, as she continued to shout: ""I have nothing to live for! I'm not worth it! Working in concert, James and the city employee pulled the woman to the ground. Then, with the help of arriving officers, she was placed on a chair. A witness, who called 911, said it was clear the duo had saved a life.

One of two MPD officers, who were now on scene, immediately recognized James as one of the men currently living downtown. The officers, James, and the city employee worked to comfort and contain the distraught woman, holding and hugging her, keeping her seated. She was still trying to break free, still wanting to jump.

A MPD lieutenant brought a wheelchair to the roof, and that was used to get the woman to a safe place.

The officer, who knew the homeless man, told him what a great and heroic thing he had done. She told him someday the woman would thank him, and thank the city employee too.

At the same moment, the city employee was explaining, to the other officer, that the woman had come to her Community Development Authority office. The visitor was upset about her family possibly being evicted. The concerned employee sensed something was very wrong. The woman kept saying, ""I'll leave, I'll just go away."" The city worker followed her out of the Madison Municipal building, and trailed behind as the woman walked up a Monona Terrace rooftop ramp. The city employee had a gut feeling things were about to get much worse, and she was right. The woman moved to a rail, clutched it with her hands, put a foot up, and was about to jump. That was when the employee decided to act fast. She knew she could not bring the woman back from the brink by herself. She just hoped - as she yelled for help and bear hugged the woman from behind - that someone would hear her pleas. A homeless man named James did.

Recently, Scott Walker's been making a lot of talk about ""Farmer-to-Farmer"", a ""joint effort by Governor Walker and UW Extension"" (according to Walker's page)

http://ready.wi.gov/drought/docs/FarmertoFarmerRelease.pdf
http://ready.wi.gov/farmerNetwork/

These official press releases watch their words pretty carefully, but the news articles I've seen all over really suggest that Walker was actively behind the program.  (I can only assume that Walker and his staff led them to that conclusion.)  The fact is that the website has been up since 2004: EIGHT YEARS.  It seems the only involvement the governor actually had with the program is helping promote it now... after dramatically cutting benefits to the state Extension workers who actually DID create and maintain the website for 8 years.

Quotes from articles:
&gt; Governor Scott Walker was in Adams County announcing a new program to help farms deal with the drought.  (http://www.waow.com/story/19132170/farm-to-farm-network-brings-hope-to-drought-areas)

&gt; Gov. Scott Walker announced a new ""Farmer to Farmer"" effort meant to help provide feed to struggling farmers Friday morning. (http://www.channel3000.com/news/Governor-announces-Farmer-to-Farmer-effort/-/1648/15773984/-/smbloqz/-/index.html)

Here's the wayback archive page for farmertofarmer.uwex.edu, showing it's been around since 2004:
http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://farmertofarmer.uwex.edu

*TL;DR - Scott Walker is taking credit for a ""new"" program that is a ""joint effort"" which is actually 8 years old and was conceived and developed by the people at UW Extension (who, since creating FarmerToFarmer, have had their benefits and take-home pay slashed dramatically by Walker)

I think the terrace is technically smoke-free (which is a little silly, because it's OUTSIDE), but I've never seen someone hassled for the occasional hookah or clove; we just can't send up plumes of smoke symbols.  It could also be really fun to bring some tea (iced might be more appropriate in May); would anyone be willing to bring cutesy teapots?  I have one small one.

Edit #2: Does anyone know if alcohol is allowed at Vilas Park?  We could have a spiked tea party picnic if so!  I know I've heard of people bringing kegs of beer there, but I'd want to make sure it's not against the rules before we do it.

Rep. Erik Severson, R-Osceola is quoted as saying ""When people in an area are not complaining about the drinking water, the water is good."" 

Many of the municipalities affected have less than a 10% college level education rate, many of them don't understand the severity of the implications of not disinfecting their water and the majority aren't aware of the scientific findings of what is in their water.  It is a governing body's job to protect its citizens for the greater good, not ""for the sake of the budget"".

You can look up your polling location [here](https://vpa.wi.gov/). If you do not have a valid ID, they will accept [several other forms](http://city.milwaukee.gov/vote) of proof of residence.

Many many years ago, my parents had [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/PUONo.jpg) taken of my brothers and me (I'm on the right, delighted by some balloons the photographer had, or so I've been told). I'd like to re-shoot this photo some 30 years later and give it to our parents as a nice Christmas present.

Luckily, this Thanksgiving, the three of us will all be home for the first time in a long time; after this, it's probably going to be another long while until the three of us see each other in person again. I'd really like to make this happen while we have this chance. Life is short, and I want to take advantage of this opportunity while I have it.

This is where I could use a little help. I'd like to match the clothing as closely as possible. Unfortunately, I am completely clothes-shopping illiterate and don't even know where to start looking (hell, I buy my fine selection of white, gray, and black t-shirts in two-packs and wear them until they literally fall apart... my winter tops are all either gifts or were bought at concert or festival merch booths, lol). The awesomest thing would be if anybody has any shirts similar to these that I could borrow or buy. If not that, any tips as to where to hunt for such fine apparel would be seriously appreciated. FWIW, for my brother on the left, I figure I'll just iron on those numbers once I find a top close enough in other aspects. Also, where in Madison can I snag some iron-on numbers?

Any help with this is seriously, seriously appreciated. I wish I had more time to flesh this out, but I really do feel like this needs to happen now or never, and it would be one of the most meaningful things I've done in a long time. Help me, ~~Obi-Wan Kenobi~~ r/madisonwi. You're my only hope.

Edit: **TL;DR:** Recreating [old photo of my brothers and me](http://i.imgur.com/PUONo.jpg) for parents. Need halp finding/making similar-looking clothes please.

Edit 2: Thank you guys so much for your suggestions! I found the red shirt at Goodwill, super cheap plain gray and black sweatshirts at Family Dollar, and iron-on sheets at Joann's. And [this font](http://www.dafont.com/bou-college.font?text=32&amp;psize=l) worked perfectly for the numbers, btw. I'll be sure to post the results!

Voting and shit?,cbbloodletting,23,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/h9yg1/meetup_saturday_june_25th_voting_and_shit/,"Well it seemed like an overwhelming decision in favor of our own Madison meetup and inviting the wisconsinites and milwaukeeans to it if they'd like. 

Here is the deal now:

The last time I put one of these ones together I was all ""meh it's only gonna be a few people we can just meet somewhere"". Well, those ~50 redditors that showed up can tell you that that turned into a few mishaps - accidentally stealing someone's birthday, no split checks, no large seating area so we were scattered. It was still insanely fun, with drunken contact being one of my new favorite passtimes (wow that sounds creepy out of context.... contact is a game, I was drunk for the record). 

SO, let's make this one a little more organized. I heard multiple suggestions. Mostly parks. 

Are we doing a park event cookout? If so, which park, we may need a permit, what about bad weather? should we take shelter into account? 

Should we just reserve out a location indoors like a restaurant? 

It would be nice to have a somewhat accurate headcount, and a somewhat accurate vote for wheres. 

Just to be clear: it will for sure be Saturday June 25th- international meetup day. 

If anyone wants to help set this up that would be great. I am currently computerless so my redditing is done by phone and library so that's a bit of a hindrance.

If you could do that before they close today could you please let me know, along with your name (at least first name and last initial) so I can tell them who to expect.

I just have a few things that I want to bring r/madisonwi up to speed on:

- The sub is now over 400 redditors deep, which is awesome. It's spiked up by about double in the last 3 or 4 months so apparently everyone is finally finding it. Keep spreading the word so we can get all the Madisonian redditors we can in here :). 

- The increasing number comes with a tiny bad side: Apparently the spam filter is accusing you guys of being scammers for no reason. That pretty much never happened when we were little, but now that the sub is growing it seems to be getting more strict. 


So, if you submit a link just bring up the new tab right away and if it doesn't pop up there then it probably got snatched. Then just send one of us a PM and we'll take it out right away. If you really don't want to check that way then I will catch it because I've been checking more often now that I know this is a problem. 


- Last note: MEETUPS. We have been having a lot of meetups now and they are pretty damn fun. So here is my proposal:

If a meetup is scheduled and everybody comes up with an agreement of time/ place/ date then just let me or a_redditor know and we can throw it up in the sidebar. This way we can have an easy go-to list on the side so everyone can see.

Though I haven't had to deal with their bullshit I've had so many friends who have suffered under MPM's neglect or incompetency. Every single thing I've heard about this company has been negative. Recently had some friends who got fucked over because of some ""mix up"" with rent checks.

Here's the worst story though:
A lady friend of mine used to live at a MPM property, had a leaky shower and malfunctioning hot/cold knob. She complained about it 4 times before they finally sent someone out there to fix it. They hired out some plumber who walked into the apartment without knocking while she was asleep in bed at 8 am. The guy leaves in the middle of the day saying he will be back and he never returns, leaves all manner of pipes and whatnot disassembled and a giant mess in the bathroom. This is on a friday, she calls and calls MPM, leaves messages and no one gets back to her. Finally on a tuesday a different guy shows up as she's leaving for work, says he needs to get into her closet to access the pipes. As this is where some sort of access panel is located she thinks nothing of it. She returns that night to find the problem is almost a bad as it was to begin with, the mess isn't as bad despite the fact that theres a bunch of drywall dust all over the bottom of her closet and shoes. Then she sees it...her sock/panty drawer (located in storage drawers in the closet) is open a bit and several pairs are missing. A jar hidden  under her bed was missing an 1/8 of dank and a 1/4 of mushrooms. And the worst...some of her dirty underwear are gone. She calls up MPM to complain that the plumbing issue still isnt fixed all the way and tell them about the theft of the clothes (leaving out the theft of the drugs of course). The person answering the phone takes a message says a rep will get back to her asap. Repeat 3 more times over the span of a week. Finally she threatens to call the cops. (I know, I know she should have then)

 Someone calls her back and says they will contact the plumbers and investigate and that they will send someone new to fix the problem properly. 2 weeks pass and nothing. Fed up and extremely shy by nature, my friend just gives up. I tried to get her to contact the cops but at this point she was so disgusted and sick of the whole mess she didn't want to deal with it anymore. The shower wasn't completely unusable, and having already decided not to renew the lease for previous bullshittery, she just rode out the rest of it out. 2 months later and she was out of there.",,False,,t5_2r8rz,1340512050.0,,,True,t3_vigli,http://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/vigli/what_are_some_of_your_madison_property_management/,

I was contacted by somebody trying to put together a meetup from r/milwaukee and they threw out the idea of a statewide meetup. I know, that seems like quite a feat but i wanted to throw it out there for consideration. 

So here's the skibs:

We could find a place in madison - bar, park, etc. - and set up a meetup there.

Or

We could try to work with mke and wi to make a giant meetup. If a large number of people can't make a state wide meetup then we can keep them separate. I would rather have a big madison one than have a bunch of madisonians go to a state wide one and a bunch go to a local one.

Since I have a high-deductible health plan with a Health Savings Account (HSA), I try to shop around for the best deals possible. It would be a hell of a lot easier if we had those health care exchanges in place (DHS was putting them in place for WI, but our idiot governor halted the work and opted for a Federal exchange I think).

Anyway, here is a tidbit of info for dealing with UW Hospital &amp; Clinics. 

OK, after some stupidly long calls to the hospital and clinic, this is what I found out:

Every time we go to a doctor visit, there are 2 sets of bills for each service:

* one goes to the doctors

* one goes to the facilities

*for example, if I get an ekg test, 4 things get billed - 1 to the doctor for the visit, 1 for the doctor to interpret the test, 1 for the clinic for the visit, and 1 for the clinic to run the test*

If we want to get an estimate for an upcoming bill that includes the total amount from both sides, we have to call a ""Priceline"" office

* The priceline for UW Hospital &amp; Clinic + UW Doctors, only good for UW Hospital and UW East Clinic is 608-263-1507
* The priceline for the Unity health/UW Sun Prairie Clinic = 608-829-5217
* Other clinics may have their own priceline number, so the key is to ask the clinic where you have the appointment for their specific priceline number

These numbers should be able to estimate both facility and doctor charges.

This stuff is stupidly hard, just to obscure total costs and prevent honest comparison between providers - and to pay for the bloated bureaucracy of our health care indentured servitude system.

The place is nice and is just off the beltline. There is on site laundry, as well as free parking and a bus stop right out side for your pubic transport needs. Once the lease is up in May, you could pick up and leave or stay as long as you would like. They offer 6,8, and 12 month leases. It would be a huge help for me and my girlfriend. Here is a link to check out the pictures we've taken of the place. It is a nice 1st floor, one bedroom place with balcony. Please contact me as soon as possible. This offer will be available until the place is taken, but like I said, I would be willing to throw money at the rent if someone is willing to take it and move in at the end of January/Beginning of February.

Quick background: internet wasn't working, called Charter, did the usual troubleshooting to no avail, rep finally scheduled someone to come and fix it (which they did). I then see a $50 ""service charge"" on my bill. The best part is at the end when the agent finally just says ""send a letter"" and disconnects. It's only a $50 charge, but it's more the principle that I'm upset about.



**Kayla M**:  Hello!  My name is Kayla, and thank you for choosing Charter. I hope you are having a great day Trent. How can I attempt to make it even better?

**Trent**:  We were having trouble with our internet service earlier this week, and after calling in and doing some troubleshooting, the representative finally scheduled an appointment for someone to come take a look.

**Trent**:  A guy came yesterday and was able to fix the problem, which is great. What I'm wondering is why there is a ~$50 ""service charge"" on my bill now.

**Trent**:  For fixing something that clearly wasn't our fault.

**Kayla M**:  Anytime a technician comes out and you do not have our wire maintenance fee on the account there is a fee just so you know for future visits. Our wire maintenance plan is $4.99 a month.

**Trent**:  ...that seems kind of ridiculous. To charge us for fixing a service that you're supposed to be providing.

**Trent**:  I realize you don't make the policies, but is there anything I can do to contest this?

**Kayla M**:  I do apologize for any inconvenience.

**Kayla M**:  Unfortunately, the fee is valid.

**Trent**:  Also, I feel like we should probably have been alerted to this fact when someone was scheduled to come look at the equipment.

**Trent**:  I assumed a routine service visit to fix things would not be something I would be charged for, and I was certainly not given any indication otherwise before the charge appeared on the bill.

**Kayla M**:  Allow me to apologize for any miscommunication.

**Kayla M**:  Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Trent**:  I guess not. There's no possible way I can lodge a formal complaint or anything like that?

**Kayla M**:  On charter.com/contact us

**Trent**:  Where should I go from there?

**Kayla M**:  Once you have clicked on contact us you can click on corporate information.

**Kayla M**:  Was there anything else I can do for you today?

**Trent**:  It just lists the general Charter phone # under ""Customer Inquiries""

**Kayla M**:  Then you can send a letter to 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St. Louis, MO 63131-12405

**Kayla M**:  I would like to thank you for being a loyal customer and choosing Charter and you have a great rest of the day, Trent. If you do have any future questions, feel free to contact us at www.charter.com/contact. Thank you.

So I only really know about it secondhand, but apparently they were quite small—one is tan, one is multi-colored, and both have pushed-in noses and big round heads like Ewoks.

I think the guy's next stop was going to be the Dane County Humane Society, so if your dogs sound anything like I've described (bearing in mind that my description likely sucks), you may want to give them a shout.

I'll be there by 10:00, so that's when I'll make the official start time. (hopefully I'll be able to get there earlier, but there's no guarantee I'll get out of work in time) If people would like to show up earlier, feel free. One thing I'd like to note is that the **kitchen closes at 10**, so if you would like to get food you should get there a little earlier.  When I arrive, I'll have a 8.5x14 reddit alien.

Just in case people missed the initial post, Vintage has a special on Thursdays where **all their tap beers under 7% Alcohol By Volume are $3**. The general consensus at the meetups so far has been that it's a really good deal.

Last week went really well.  A number of our regulars weren't able to make it and we still had the biggest group we've had yet.  I talked to a few people at last night's movie meetup and it seems like we should have another good sized group this week.

I also wanted to point something out: people who aren't from the West Side are definitely welcome to come out for this...haha, apparently the ""holy crap there are a lot of west siders"" vibe from the initial post caused a lot of people to think this was an exclusive event

I'll post my phone number on Thursday night so people can find us, but if our group is at least as big as it was last week we'll either be in the area directly to the right of the door or in the back left corner where the larger tables are.

Hi, Madison! My band, Quiet Loudly, is going on tour this November and we need some local help.

We're a psych-pop/indie rock band from Brooklyn, NY. We just put out our new record and we're heading west on with our friends Pow Wow!, also from Brooklyn, and also supporting a new record.

There is one date left to fill while we're on the road: Tuesday 11/13.  We are hoping to come to Madison if all works out, but we haven't had much luck finding a venue.  On top of that, once we do find a place to play, we would love to share the stage with one or two local bands. We would obviously be able to return the favor in Brooklyn if any local bands can help us out in your neck of the woods.

Here is a link to listen to our new record we are touring behind: http://quietloudly.bandcamp.com And here is a link to Pow Wow!'s new EP they are touring for: http://powwow.bandcamp.com

It's very easy to be mean to the lights on a screen making up the text of a name, but the reality of Reddit (especially a city specific sub Reddit) is that these are all people, and in the name of friendship it is perhaps best that nothing is said that could not be said to that persons face.

The campaign I am thinking of running involves being stranded on a deserted island with cannibals and evil serpent clerics :-D


**Who**: Anyone with any interest, I can teach everything. Even if you are only in Madison for the summer, you can get a few sessions in.


**When**: Sundays (weekly or bi-weekly depending on interest) at 4pm (negotiable) starting on July 17th and running as long as people want


**Where**: I suggest we find a place at Union South, but I'm open to suggestions


Who is interested? What do you think of the time? We could do Saturdays or earlier on Sunday if it would be more convenient for most people. Any location suggestions?

Finally, if you are mostly sure that you will be joining us please use the above link to find which class you will be playing (wizard, alchemist, barbarian, etc) and post it so the other players can plan their characters accordingly.


Join us and your quest to become a supernerd will be one step closer to completion!

**EDIT**: I think what we'll do is meet next Sunday (July 17th) at 4pm at Union South. We will make characters and plan details. Generally this sort of thing works best with 4-6 players, but since the flake-out rate is generally high it would be fine to start with more. (So come one, come all!)

**EDIT2**We're still on for Sunday at 4 at union South. Let's meet by the tables closest to the Randall St @ Johnson entrance and find where to go from there.

I'm so frustrated, because I really liked that venue, but they made it so god damned hard to play there. If they would have opened their doors to local acts earlier (like the Frequency) we could have brought loads of people in there over the course of the 4 years we tried to book shows. Up until very recently, I don't think they even responded to most local acts contacting them.

I walked by one day with my band, and employees from the Regent Street Retreat were standing outside offering free beer for people to just come in there. If they would have let us book the show we had tried to book for that very day, we would have brought in 25+ people. But they refused, so we had the show at the Frequency.

**AT&amp;T**

 DSL or UVERSE - prices are OK for internet-only with DSL but not so much for UVERSE, speeds are slow for DSL and OK for UVERSE, they don't block ports, and service is pretty stable, but they supported Walker, they send all internet and phone traffic to the NSA apparently, and they are starting bandwidth caps (150GB - 25GB per month)


**Charter**

internet only packages are OK priced, speeds are pretty good, they do block ports, they actively deny access to sites they don't agree with (P2P), they did not support Walker (probably because they are near bankrupt), and they have bandwidth caps (150GB - 250GB per month)

On the West side, it looks like **TDS** is available for home DSL, but I don't know much about them, except they too supported Walker.

For me, I use Vonage, watch a lot of Netflix, and run a home web server for photo/video sharing with my family and AT&amp;T DSL has been OK with low prices. Now, with the new data caps, I'm going to get screwed. I'll be paying a ton more to switch to UVERSE (to get the higher caps) and still may go over the data limits. At least going over the monthly caps doesn't auto-terminate the account. They just charge +$10/50GB. But sticking with AT&amp;T means sticking with Walker and wiretapping, which sucks. Switching to Charter means doing a bunch of crap to keep my web server up and risking account termination if I go over the data caps. It is a no-win situation.

This week, I'm working the early shift, so I'll be able to meet up before our normal start time if there is interest.  It seems like a lot of people tend to get there around 9:30-10 anyway...**but if you'd be able to make it earlier feel free to post and we'll see if anyone would like to get something going before our normal start time.**

Another thing I'd like to note is that the kitchen closes at 10, so if you would like to get food you should get there earlier.  When I arrive, I'll have a 8.5x14 reddit alien. (I swear, I mean it this time!!!)

Just in case people missed the initial post, Vintage has a special on Thursdays where all their tap beers under 7% Alcohol By Volume are $3. The general consensus at the meetups so far has been that it's a really good deal.

Last week we had a ton of people...stay home because the weather was awful.  But in all seriousness, our last meetup (on the thirteenth) was pretty fun, and I""m hoping the potential for an earlier start time can get some new people to come out for the meetup.

I also wanted to point something out: people who aren't from the West Side are definitely welcome to come out for this...haha, apparently the ""holy crap there are a lot of west siders"" vibe from the initial post caused a lot of people to think this was an exclusive event 

To make it easier (and because I realized my number is already in about a half dozen different spots on this sub) I've posted my phone number at the bottom of this post so that people can find us on Thursday night, but we've been meeting in the back left corner where the larger tables are.

Also yeah ok I'll have a (momentary pause while I look around my desk) small white tube of acrylic paint as a totem.

If the place is already packed then we'll call an audible and throw a post-script.

**Sunday Post-Edit:** Internet was spotty so I was forced off the grid last night but attendance was more than zero so we'll call it a rousing success.

* Tree Bar = Paul's Club Bar on state street.
* Bear/Lynx/ Mounds = Effigy Mounds in Elmside Park
* Old Beets = Old Sugar Distillery
* Great Spirit = Monument ""Let the Great Spirit Soar"" in Elmside Park near the effigy mounds
* ~~Monkeys night out = 1960  36 Rhesus monkey's escaped~~ Clue needed for Vilas Zoo
* 9XM-WHA = 9XM-WHA ""Oldest Station in the Nation"" Under Science Hall
* Civil War Barracks = Camp Randall
* Steensland over Yahara = Steensland Bridge on E Wash.

I don't have any order to it yet. Yes most of these are on the east side because that is where we live.

Thought's? Additions? Subtractions?

Community Additions:

To Jim Hightower's staff to out editor supreme Dustin Beilke.

It has been a model of grass roots organizing. Almost no staff, but great enthusiaam. Always on the edge of financial disaster, somehow you fill the buckets, rent the tables, buy the mustard, shirts, glasses and cups. While there are as many thoughts about the reasons for success, I believe that having Fighting Bob.com as our progressive voice--with daily blogs and superb articles has given us reach and has allowed us to stop fretting that the corporate media won't cover our events--we provide our own coverage.

We have a great program this year. Ruth Conniff will co-chair this Bob Fest. Barbara Lawton will lead the Destructive Force of Citizens United along with Norman Solomon and Mike McCabe; ""ALEC Exposed"" will be led by Lisa Graves; Terry O'Neil, president of NOW, will facilitate the real war on women; Mike Papantonio from Rink of Fire will stir the souls. Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, will speak. Our La Follette historian Nancy Unger will be here; Mining in Wisconsin will be a fight we must win.

Phil Donahue, Gwen Moore, Tammy Baldwin, John Nichols, Greg Palast, Juan Cole, and Mahlon Mitchell will inspire the audience, Bill McKibben is coming and I can't think of anyone in America better than Bill on climate change. Speaking of change, we will have a breakout on ""The Next Generation.""

We have an idea. We want to convert you from observer to Member. We want to recruit two thousand of you to become charter members of Workers of Wisconsin (WOW!) Not a union, not a political party but a hybrid. The idea is to have branches in all Congressional Districts to do everything from research to taking the lead on helping in local fights, from mining to Credit Union protection. The challenge is to decentralize without losing the glue that binds us while we grow and grow. Bob Fest North proved that locals can manage very well.

Transparency is key; member involvement in established Fighting Bob gives us a head start.
