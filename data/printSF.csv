Out of 1,426 total votes, I've compiled a simple list of every book/series that received more than one vote (I'll use the word ""nominated"" for such books from now on). So you can treat this as a list of books that are not merely a kooky fringe preference on /r/printSF. A ranked list by vote total will follow between now and Sunday! Thanks for your patience!

* **The Longlist (currently ordered by first name):** http://txtup.co/QcYom

Initial awards: 

* **Most works nominated by a single author**: Isaac Asimov, with 8 unique works. 

* **Most misspelled author's name**: In the past, it's always been said that Samuel Delany has the most-misspelled name in science fiction. But now **Paolo Bacigalupi** has stolen the crown! 100% of the people who voted for ""The Windup Girl"" spelled its author's name in a unique manner.

* **Most tragic mistaken voting victim**: **Samuel Delany** takes a new dubious honor, as he only made it onto the longlist thanks to two voters who honored him for Alfred Bester's famous novel, ""The Stars My Destination."" Seriously, people?

* **The Blind Librarian Award:** Ted Chiang's collection, **Stories of Your Life and Others**, is so popular among readers of novels that it is apparently now being shelved as a novel.

* **The Blind Librarian Award for Critical Evaluation of Nonexistent Books**: H.G. Wells's classic, ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" received one vote, which I charitably combined with a vote for Wells's apocryphal novel, ""The Island of Dr. Franklin.""",,False,,t5_2rzjk,1366136692.0,,,True,t3_1ch2xw,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1ch2xw/rprintsf_favorite_novel_poll_long_list/,moderator

1362290992.0,60,self.printSF,19kcv6,Giving some well-deserved love to two indie SF books--some of the most satisfying science fiction I've come across in a while. ,Al_Batross,65,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/19kcv6/giving_some_welldeserved_love_to_two_indie_sf/,"The first is [The Martian](http://www.amazon.com/The-Martian-ebook/dp/B009IEXKXI) by Andy Weir. It's a 99 cent Kindle original. These are usually terrible, and I started this with low expectations. It's freaking amazing--really compelling, detailed hard SF. The premise is a lone astronaut gets stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves him for dead. The entire book is him using his engineering skills and ingenuity to survive. It's very *Apollo 13* in feel. There are no aliens, no nanomachines, etc. Just extremely detailed, well worked out descriptions of the problems and realities of space exploration, with technology that is very close to modern-day. And a very loving look at the ethos of the space program. I don't know the author's bio, but he clearly knows his stuff. Really good hard SF. 

The other one is a little trickier to explain, and maybe not for everyone on here; it's [Constellation Games](http://www.amazon.com/Constellation-Games-Leonard-Richardson/dp/1936460238) by Leonard Richardson. I tried a sample after seeing a rave review for it on BoingBoing, and got sucked in. Ignore the bad cover and the stupid subtitle. The easiest way to describe this is the SF version of *John Dies at the End*. It's got a slacker hero and is filled with goofy humor, but, like *John*, it's not just silly; there's a real, thought-out story there too, in this case a very densely packed story about first contact with an alien race. Weirdly, there is some utterly fascinating stuff about what alien videogames would look like. Much of it is told in the form of blog posts, IM conversations, and videogame reviews. It's quirky and densely weird, but packed with ideas and great jokes. This is probably more a book for people who enjoy a dose of baroqueness and humor in their SF--fans of early Neal Stephenson or Nick Harkaway, say.

If no one else on Print SF claims to have read it I'll throw it on a list of Good Little-Known SF for people who are looking for good things to read that are off the beaten path.  I've added a comment below for each title that I can think of which fits this description.  If you have some suggestions I encourage you to add a comment for each as well.  Don't forget to add a comment to the books that you have read so I know not to add them to the list.

We like to moderate with a light touch here in r/PrintSF. In doing so, we've been guided by a couple of unwritten rules, which, in the interests of not *having* to moderate forcefully in the future, we thought we would make explicit.

1. Don't be rude to other posters. You're here to talk about ideas and share the literature that excites you. Thankfully, tensions don't run as high here as they do on the *Star Trek* or *Twilight* forums, but from time to time, disagreements do occur. If you think the person you're talking to is an idiot, don't just tell them they're an idiot. Argue in a civil tone, or seek common ground, or don't answer at all.

2. No (more) self-promotion. This means: no links to your own writing, no e-book giveaways, no pleas for Amazon reviews, no requests for feedback on your own writing. There are forums that are more open to that, like r/writing and r/SFstories, but not this one. You're welcome to mention or link to your own work if the topic comes up naturally in a discussion (e.g., if you had written a SF story involving telepathy, then [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/qqgs0/is_telepathy_still_viable_in_science_fiction/) would have been a fine place to talk about it.). But please don't make self- or link-posts with the intent to promote your own work. We don't want PrintSF to get overrun like the Amazon forums.

That lead me to [Blueprints of the Afterlife](http://www.amazon.com/Blueprints-Afterlife-Ryan-Boudinot/dp/0802170919) by Ryan Boudinot.  Multiple story lines across different places / times woven together by a single narrative interview with the protagonist.  Beautifully crafted and a smart take on a classic SF theme.

Now Im reading [Liminal States](http://www.amazon.com/Liminal-States-Zack-Parsons/dp/0806533641) by Zack Parsons.  Only about 15% into it and im hooked deep.

Anybody else ever go on an SF hot streak like this?  Care to share how it unfolded?

1366143172.0,43,self.printSF,1chepq,Full data for /r/PrintSF favorite novel survey,punninglinguist,51,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1chepq/full_data_for_rprintsf_favorite_novel_survey/,"First, here is the full data, a simple list of vote counts for each title/author tuple: http://txtup.co/NuvTr

Anyone who wants to paste it into Excel and tell us about what they find is welcome to do so! This is especially welcome if you find any mistakes in the data (e.g., works being listed twice because of uncorrected misspellings). 

**Anyway, the rankings.** If we count novels and the series that contain them separately, then the top 10 (11, due to ties) are as follows:

61. Frank Herbert	 **Dune**
32. Orson Scott Card	 **Ender's Game**
32. Dan Simmons	 **Hyperion** (tie with Ender's Game)
29. William Gibson	 **Neuromancer**
26. Isaac Asimov	 **Foundation**
26. Gene Wolfe	 **The Book Of The New Sun** (tied with Foundation)
24. Neal Stephenson	 **Snow Crash**
22. Isaac Asimov	 **Foundation Series**
21. Robert Heinlein	 **The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress**
21. Neal Stephenson	 **Anathem**
21. Douglas Adams	 **The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy** (tied with Anathem and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress)

If we count a vote for a series as also being a vote for all the books that contain it (but not vice versa, on the theory that people vote for individual books in a series when they want to privilege that book over the rest of the series), then things change slightly:

61. Frank Herbert	 **Dune**
26. Isaac Asimov	 **Foundation**
32. Dan Simmons	 **Hyperion**
32. Orson Scott Card	 **Ender's Game**
29. William Gibson	 **Neuromancer**
26. Gene Wolfe	 **The Book Of The New Sun** 
24. Neal Stephenson	 **Snow Crash**
24. Douglas Adams	 **The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy** 
21. Robert Heinlein	 **The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress**
21. Neal Stephenson	 **Anathem** (tie with The Moon is a Harsh Mistress)

If anyone wants to do more data manipulation, e.g., coming up with a most popular author ranking, then have at it!

By metafiction I'm referring to techniques such as breaking the fourth wall (characters addressing the audience), the author addressing the reader, a story about a writer writing a story, a story containing another work of fiction within it, a work where the narrator reveals himself or herself as the author of the story, narrative footnotes, etc....

My favorites:

1. *Beyond Apollo*, Brian N. Malzberg (1972) -- what you read is potentially the novel written by the main character, however, he's most likely insane so attempting to get AT his voyage is purposefully layered... Complicating the matter is how incredibly unreliable of a narrator he is and the fact that he's telling many versions of the same story.  Malzberg is clearly poking fun at pulp science fiction throughout. 

2. *The Iron Dream*, Norman Spinrad (1972) -- in an alternate past Hitler leaves Germany for the United States after WWI and becomes a hack sci-fi writer (WWII never happens).  What you read is Hitler's Hugo winning novel, Lord of the Swastika (which is really a sort of sci-fi post-apocalyptical future version of what Hitler wants to do -- and really DID albeit in a different way in real life) -- also, attached to the end is a brief afterword by an ""editor"" of Lord of the Swastika -- which, is clearly some version of Spinrad for he critiques his own writing.  Absolutely brilliant.  Spinrad DESERVES a revival. 

3. *Man in a High Castle*, Philip K. Dick (1962) -- most sci-fi fans know this one....  Not only is I Ching used as an external narrative dictating principle supposedly by Dick but a novel appears within the book describing what really happened in WWII.... A delightful work and an easy way to introduce people to metafiction.

4. *The Einstein Intersection*, Samuel R. Delany (1967) -- a bizarre tale, as are most of Delany's works, where Delany's own travel experiences feature heavily before each chapter...  The interplay between the actual narrative and his interjections can be intriguing (although, when I first read the book years ago I found it more frustrating than not -- but, it can be downright poetic).

Some of Heinlein's works are metafiction, a few of Ellison's, more of Malzberg's, etc etc etc....  

I'd love to hear your favorites (they don't have to be novels)!

Not only is Teela made into a sexual object, but her only attribute that is described in a positive way (aside from luck) is her appearance. The only other female character in Ringworld, Prill, is literally a whore. As for the two alien species, puppeteers and kzin, they are described as having non-sentient females (or something akin to females) who are used strictly for the purposes of procreation. Yes, I know they're aliens. I would have excused one species having non-sentient females as a creative exercise. But not two, and not the only two described at any length, and not in the context of the rest of Niven's problems with characterizing female characters. Is the rest of Niven's work this sexist?

I'd also like it to deal a lot with the idea and subject of humanity -- war is a great backdrop, but Star Wars wasn't full of the philosophical musings on humanity's existence in a lonely universe, like Reynolds's universe was.

If anyone could suggest me up some good books that roughly fit the criteria, I'd be grateful. 

TL;DR I want hard sci fi mixed with space opera.

I just finished Clifford D. Simak's underrated/underread novel *Why Call Them Back From Heaven?* (1967) which speculates in magisterial fashion about what would happen to our society if almost everyone bought into the idea that immortality would be a real possibility sometime in the future.  Of course, immortality itself has not been discovered yet.  

I also adored James Gunn's *The Immortals* (1962) which explores the social space that is created by the presence of immortals -- they themselves are not main characters. 

Another intriguing but flawed read is Raymond Z. Gallun’s *The Eden Cycle* (1974) which attempts to convey, at moments effectively, the ennui of an endless existence with endless possibilities.  Unfortunately, the reader too feels the effects of repetitive inundation.

Bob Shaw's novel *One Million Tomorrows* (variant title: *1 Million Tomorrows*) (1971) was an intriguing attempt as well -- BUT, in his vision of immortality has some substantial side effects for men....  The loss of sexual ability...

The SF Encyclopedia lists quite a few examples but no way lists everything out there -- http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/immortality

**In short**, there are many many many many novels/shorts stories on this theme and **I'd love to hear your favorites** -- I plan on putting together a substantial list of examples of the theme.  

ALSO: If anyone can remember a Silverberg short novel on the theme of immortality ""about a guy who tries to hook up with his revived wife while she is in Africa on a safari, but he learns that the living and the revived no longer have anything in common so any sort of relationship is impossible....""  I'd love to know.

The story, as I recall it, read like a Heinlein story. Could be by Heinlien, or maybe someone else form the period?  

The story tells the tale of two friends who dream of going into space and seeing humanity move out into space. they take different paths to get there though - One joins a government agency, the other joins an unnamed organized crime group.  

The 'organized crime guy' slowly rises through the ranks and convinces the bosses that investing in space is good for the bottom line- space stations are above earth law after all. Also, low-gravity living is good for the older bosses.  

The 'government guy' tells his side, and how his agency is forced to act, since they can't let 'the mob' be the only 'agency' out in space.  

I think there's also some idea that the 'mob guy' did what he did with the intention of provoking earth governments to invest in space, which they do, ending up with moon bases and plans for further exploration.  

So - hoping someone out there has read this. It's been a LONG time since I read it. I recalled it when the US dropped the shuttle program, losing 'heavy' space capability.

1350549707.0,37,self.printSF,11oiyw,"Let's talk about ""Blindsight"", by Peter Watts [SPOILERS].",naura,43,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/11oiyw/lets_talk_about_blindsight_by_peter_watts_spoilers/,"I know many of you will have read this book, and I'd like to hear other opinions, commentary on the world of the novel, speculation, criticism, whatever.

I've read it seven (yes, seven) times. The most recent re-read was yesterday, so it's still fresh in my mind. Every re-read gives me some new layer of meaning or fresh insight into the world of the story.

Some miscellaneous thoughts:

 * The central thesis, that consciousness and sentience are overrated at best and counterproductive at worst, fascinated me. I study neuroscience, so this book actually illuminated and helped me articulate my evolving understanding of the human mind. Consciousness is no advantage, because ""unconscious, automatic complexity"" can do everything we can - exhibit the same behaviors, develop the same innovations, etc, through experimentation (/mutation), and competition. The argument that our consciousness allows us to experiment in ways that an unconscious being couldn't is, I think, false, because an unconscious organism doesn't necessarily lack (the behavioral cognates of) an understanding of the rules of the universe, initiative, curiosity, motivation to improve its own fitness, etc. It's unaware that it possesses all these things, but ""acts"" (more accurately, appears to act) on them nonetheless.
 * The Scramblers clearly evolved in a much harsher environment than we did, and that's why they're so much more advanced. Technology Implies Belligerence, at least against nature. Subjected to evolutionary pressures we can only have nightmares about, they've reached heights we can only dream of.
  * A relevant passage for the above two points can be found in the Notes and References at the end of the novel:

&gt;The curious nitpicker might be saying ""Yeah, but without genes how do these guys evolve? How to they adapt to novel environments? How, as a species, do they cope with the unexpected?"" And if Robert Cunningham were here today, he might say, ""I'd swear half the immune system is actively targetting the other half. It's not just the immune system, either. Parts of the nervous system seem to be trying to, well, hack each other. I think they evolve intraorganismally, as insane as that sounds. The whole organism's at war with itself on the tissue level, it's got some kind of cellular Red Queen thing happening. Like setting up a colony of interacting tumors, and counting on fierce competition to keep any one of them from getting out of hand. Seems to serve the same role as sex and mutation does for us.""

 * I like that the future isn't cartoonishly utopian or dystopian, but feels realistic and balanced.
 * The aliens are not only vastly technologically more advanced than us, they're profoundly alien in mindset and not benevolent in the slightest. They're also not villainous for some inane reason (we want your resources!/we eat humans!) You don't see this often in fiction.
 * I want to know more about the AIs in this universe. What is their relationship to the vampires? How would they view or react to the vampire takeover that is alluded to at the end of the novel? Luckily...
 * He's writing something else set in the same universe! See in the ""In Progress"" section of his website. Seems like it will be about Earth and (probably) the vampire takeover, but I have no idea.

My favorite passages:
&gt;  ""Supposing it's just— instinct,"" I suggested. ""Flounders hide against their background pretty well, but they don't think about it.""

&gt; ""Where are they going to get that instinct from, Keeton? How is it going to evolve? Saccades are an accidental glitch in mammalian vision. Where would scramblers have encountered them before now?"" Cunningham shook his head. ""That thing, that thing Amanda's robot fried— it developed that strategy on its own, on the spot. It *improvised*.""

&gt; The word intelligent barely encompassed that kind of improvisation....

&gt; ""...I think we're dealing with a species so far beyond us that even their retarded children can rewire our brains on the fly, and I can't tell you how fucking scared that should make you.""

----

&gt;Hidden in his tent, Sarasti took up the slack. ""Scramblers also use Rorschach's EM for metabolic processes. Some pathways achieve proton transfer via heavy-atom tunneling. Perhaps the ambient radiation acts as a catalyst.""

&gt;""Tunneling?"" Susan said. ""As in *quantum*?""

&gt;Cunningham nodded. ""Which also explains your shielding problems. Partly, at least.""

&gt;""But is that even possible? I mean, I thought those kind of effects only showed up under cryonic—""

&gt;""*Forget* this,"" Cunningham blurted. ""We can debate the biochemistry later, if we're still alive.""

----

&gt; The system weakens, slows. It takes so much longer now to perceive—to assess the input, mull it over, decide in the manner of cognitive beings. But when the flash flood crosses your path, when the lion leaps at you from the grasses, advanced self-awareness is an unaffordable indulgence. The brain stem does its best. It sees the danger, hijacks the body, reacts a hundred times faster than that fat old man sitting in the CEO's office upstairs; but every generation it gets harder to work around this— this creaking neurological bureaucracy.

&gt; I wastes energy and processing power, self-obsesses to the point of psychosis. Scramblers have no need of it, scramblers are more parsimonious. With simpler biochemistries, with smaller brains—deprived of tools, of their ship, even of parts of their own metabolism—they think rings around you. They hide their language in plain sight, even when you know what they're saying. They turn your own cognition against itself. They travel between the stars. This is what intelligence can do, unhampered by self-awareness.

&gt; I is not the working mind, you see. For Amanda Bates to say ""I do not exist"" would be nonsense; but when the processes beneath say the same thing, they are merely reporting that the parasites have died. They are only saying that they are free.",,False,,t5_2rzjk,1350550541.0,,,True,t3_11oiyw,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/11oiyw/lets_talk_about_blindsight_by_peter_watts_spoilers/,

I'm looking for something more upbeat, adventure tinged closer to David Weber's Honor Harrington series. I love the military...not realism...but thoroughness of David Weber's world building and also that while some bad things happen, injuries and dead loved ones, for the most part things turn out alright for Honor Harrington. Some series like that would be awesome. I couldn't put down any of the Honorverse books but now I'm through my re-read and looking for another fix.

Edit**

**Thanks for being so responsive all of you! I really appreciate it. It's a great intro to this subreddit. While I love scifi, I was probably reading 90% fantasy (everything from epic high fantasy to trashy urban fantasy) outside of some popular 'classics' like Ender's Game, Forever War, Old Man's War, and some others. So this will really help me dive in. I will start marking the book I'm currently reading and write a very short paragraph regarding my response when I'm done. Obviously, many of you will not care one way or the other as to my opinion, who has time to read every random stranger's thoughts. But for those that might find it interesting / informative, I will see if there is any response for such a thing. Keep making suggestions if you have any!

* **1632** - I really enjoyed this one. It was a quick piece of speculative fiction. Basically the author was describing what if a post-Vietnam War era rural West Virginian town was suddenly transplanted in 1632 era Germany in the middle of the 30-years war. How would they survive? How much would their tech advantage help them and what challenges would they run into? How would they alter history?

[The Book of Dave-Will Self](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Dave-Novel-Will-Self/dp/1596913843/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344568841&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+book+of+dave) is about Dave, an east london cab driver who gets left by his wife and loses custody of their child. Depressed and angry, Dave writes a hateful, misogynistic screed (on metal sheets) as a ""guide-to-life"" for his son in the future. Each chapter alternates between Dave's present time, and 500 years into the future, where England has regressed to a primitive society where ""The Book of Dave"" has been long declared law.

Sci fi about the ethics of food. A strange novel indeed.

Literally. And Anthony Van Horne must tow the corpse to the Arctic (to preserve Him from sharks and decomposition). En route Van Horne must also contend with ecological guilt, a militant girlfriend, sabotage both natural and spiritual, and greedy hucksters of oil, condoms, and doubtful ideas. Winner of a 1995 World Fantasy Award. First in a trilogy. 

[Random Acts of Senseless Violence-Jack Womack](http://www.amazon.com/Random-Acts-Senseless-Violence-Womack/dp/0802134246/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344570246&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=random+acts+of+senseless+violence) A prequel of sorts to his speculative future U.S. society, complete with evolved language and violent tendencies.

It looks like opinions are mixed on this one, with some people here saying it was great and fun, while other are saying it's poorly written, sub-par YA.

I've never quit on a book, but I'm really hoping that this one gets better soon. I was under the impression that the gaming and 80s elements were important but also a bit more subtle. So far the whole thing has been an almost literal checklist. Just rattling off the names of movies from the late 1980s isn't ""references"", that's just CTRL-V of a Wikipedia page.

Maybe I'm coming at it from the wrong angle? I just read *Frontera* and C.S. Friedman's short story *Dominion*, both of which are quick and shallow but seem more evocative and thoughtful.

Does *RPO* develop past the superficial referencing? Do the 80s tidbits become their own Easter Eggs? Or does it just trudge along in the fashion of ""This guy said something about D&amp;D, and that guy likes *Ladyhawke* but you like Ewoks""?

It starts with an awesome prolog and then the next 50 - 100 pages feel more like a fantasy novel which was hard to slog through. Overall I much prefered the parts that were taking place outside of the tines world. The zones concept is very interesting and I thought the newsgroup like messages added a lot of atmosphere to it. Space did feel vastly empty but at the same time filled with a huge number of civilizations.  I thought that just enough was explained to make the concepts interesting but still leave enough mystery to engage the mind.

Back to the tines, the group thought idea was well executed but overall none of the characters were really great and their motives not always clear. At the end (ENDING SPOILER AHEAD) [Spoiler](/s ""I felt really bad for the humans that are now stuck on this planet and cut away from all the interesting stuff  that happens outside of it"").

I don't have much to say about the prose, it was pretty generic. Not bad, but nothing that can carry a book on its own. I thought the level of knowledge of the narrator was too inconsistent and didn't make much sense. Sometimes he would be an all knowing narrator and sometime not but there wasn't a always a character in the scene whose thought he reflected, it was a more a tool to make the scene interesting by not giving full information to the reader, which is OK I guess but was inconsistent with other times were the narrator did know everything. Overall it wasn't a major flaw but it was strange the few times I did notice it.


I understand that Deepness in Sky is considered much better but I don't know if it's because the parts I didn't like about Fire were improved or if the parts I did like got the front seat ( I know it's a prequel). I will probably get to it someday (it has a very good reputation) but I don't know the priority I need to assign to it in my imaginary reading list.

NOT KNOWING IS KILLING ME!",delicious_cheese,38,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1b6f04/reddit_i_need_your_help_remembering_an_obscure/,"So there are 2 books im aware of in the series with possibly more.

I picked up the first and second books about 15 years ago, back when i was a teenager, from a little second hand book score in the middle of nowhere. The books were great fun to read and its killing me that i remember so many details about the novels, but not the damned titles or names of any characters/places.


Google has failed me.... Maybe you can help?

The foggy details: A planet is attacked by a mystery force of badguys and a husband and wife who happened to be nearby are conscripted by the army and told to construct and engage a special teleportation device to help the ground forces mount a surprise attack to retake the planet.

Their FTL technology involves moving into ""C squared space""... I think...

The planet has an orbital station which is like a dyson sphere, but tubular in shape. Much of the novel takes place aboard this station and while there, the main character poses as a scientist and fools the badguys into building the thing for him.

The baddies have a secret weapon. A gigantic ship that they bring into the planets atmosphere by matching the speed of the planets rotation and dropping it directly down. The good guys mount an attack on it by parachuting down from orbit onto the thing. There is space battles and ground battles and all manner of entertaining pulp.

The second novel follows both the main character from the last novel and a new female character who is an australian linguist and a prisoner of the baddies. The baddies make first contact with an interesting alien species of centaur like people with Lamarckian evoloutionary traits and a breeding cycle which each individual changes sex. The female of the species is the intelligent, sentient form and at the end of her cycle she devolves into a small flying male with the intelligence of a parrot.

The linguist helps communicate with the aliens and the baddies convince the aliens (who are masters of bioengineering) to make bioweapons for them.

The final space battle takes place in a binary system around the small planetoid in the middle.


Thats about all the details i have for now. You would think that with THAT MUCH INFO i would be able to turn up something on google..... But no. Not an iota.

If you haven't read any of his books, you totally should. They're all available for free at http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts.htm. I recommend starting with the latest one, Blindsight. It's a standalone and is one of the best books I have read last year. Very hard scifi writer, who has been described as 'Greg Egan with focus on biology'.**

Surprisingly, couldn't find anything about these books on reddit, so decided to take matter in my own hands. BTW, you can read all of them completely for free on [the author's website](http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts.htm). 

Some random thoughts to start the discussion:

1. Starfish was my favorite. New world, lots of character development, reasonably high stakes. Later books went a bit overboard on the ""end of the world"" stuff. Not that I didn't enjoy that, but easy to get overwhelmed.
2. Didn't like Maelstrom too much. Still a solid book, but all the computer virus evolution thing was quite a stretch for me, as a computer scientist. If the whole point was that they weren't sentient, how can they be viewpoint characters? Lawbreakers were pretty cool, though. Also, hard to sympathize with a protagonist who is trying to destroy the world. The twist about [spoiler](/s ""Lenie's fake memories"") wasn't particularly surprising. Not even sure if it was supposed to be a twist, given all the hints.
3. The last book is very engrossing too. I liked the second half more than the first (poor [spoiler](/s ""Rowan, she was pretty much the only ""normal"" person, as much as it can be said about anyone there"")). Lubin is a pretty cool guy, eh doesn't afraid of anything (sorry, couldn't help myself). Don't know what to say about the [spoiler](/s ""Achilles"") storyline, other than ""ughhh"". The ending wraps up most of the threads nicely, despite being, technically, open (""Failure to converge. Confidence limits exceeded"").",,False,,t5_2rzjk,1361584777.0,,goodreads,True,t3_191ro4,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/191ro4/lets_talk_about_the_rifters_trilogy_by_peter/,

This is my personal hybrid order, based partly on the internal chronological order of the stories, and partly on the order the stories were written. In my opinion, this order gives a better sense of the development of the story *and* Asimov's direction than simply following the internal chronology or the order of publication. 

Also, I think it's compulsory to read 'Forward the Foundation' last. Asimov ""ended"" the series by taking it back to its beginning - I think it's a nice touch. This book is also (in my opinion) some of Asimov's best writing. The final scene in this book is a very appropriate way to finish.

So...

1. I, Robot

2. The Caves of Steel

3. The Naked Sun

4. The Robots of Dawn

5. Robots and Empire

6. The Stars, Like Dust--

7. The Currents of Space

[The Dark Beyond the Stars](http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Beyond-Stars-Novel/dp/product-description/0312866240). My mother bought this for me many years ago and I've never forgotten it. It's one of the few 'generation ship' novels that I have read (and know about, to be honest). It has some great reviews, so I know other people like it, but I never see it mentioned anywhere.

Another one that I don't see talked about much is C.S. Friedman's [The Madness Season](http://www.amazon.com/Madness-Season-Daw-Science-Fiction/dp/0886774446). Told in a mixture of 1st and 3rd person, this one manages to tell a story with a fairly small cast of characters and yet conveys an epic scope.

Mike finding sex to be the most wonderful thing in the universe and saying it was better than anything Martians had to offer was also annoying. For somebody so supposedly highly intelligent and insightful into the majesty of existence, doesn't it seem strange that he decides that friction and nerve clusters + messy discharge is the pinnacle of emotional expression?

""Living spaceships? Vast empires? How grand!"" I thought. But then I read Consider Phlebas, and The Player of Games and they were honestly some of the two worst books I have ever read.

The plot just drags on and on and on and nothing happens. In Consider Phlebas the protagonist (see? I can't even remember his name that's how boring he was) and the rest of the crew who are all equally boring and indistinguishable from each other spend twenty or so pages assaulting a monastery, an event that ultimately has no bearing on the story. The characters drift about on a thin and barely justified plot, never interacting, never growing, and eventually spend literally the last fourth of the book *walking down a mine shaft*. Chapters of walking in the dark, pursuing some meaningless mcguffin that really shouldn't be worth it. Then they all die. Just like that, dead, all of them, and I didn't care because *Characterization? What's that?* Most pointless book I've ever read.


Player of Games was a least slightly better in that it had a plot. Also there were a few of the sentient space ships and robots I'd been so excited for. But the whole book was just so boring! ""Look!"" says Ian M. Banks, ""I've invented an interesting anarcho-communist space fairing culture of men and machines! I think I'll send my protagonist to the Large Megallinic Cloud to play a vaguely defined board game against a boring race of humanoids who are all sado-masichistic sex fiend capitalists because that's how we can tell they're *bad*.""

What's more Bank's never defines what exactly this board game, which apparently determines the ownership of the empire, is. He throws about words like Board of Origin and counters, pieces, and points, but the game doesn't make any sense. The protagonist spends most of the book locked in a struggle the author can't figure out how to express!


Also, why would a race in an *entirely different galaxy* be humanoid? And have a culture *heavy-handedly like 20th century Earth with drugs and capitalism. Ahem this book is like bad satire ahem.*

So anyway I wasn't a big fan of the books, which is sad because I'd really heard so much good about them! What's Reddit's take on the Culture series? Do they get better?

They would become superstar entertainers and people would go on pilgrimages to visit their ""shrines"" to see their shows in person, treating them almost as gods.  Someone was killing off these beings and the main character was trying to figure out the killer.  Another component that stuck with me was that their transports used MGD drives.

Two of the first six books in the list are not available on Kindle and from past experience it's not uncommon to find many books in 'best of scifi' lists as unavailable in electronic version.
It strikes me as odd that the visionaries and/or publishers of works that imagine our future are so opposed to electronic versions of their books. It doesn't take much for someone to scan a hardcopy and OCR it to digital, so it's not like withholding an electronic copy will do much good against piracy in the long run.

I'm also not a fan of exclusive deals with specific e-tailers, assuming there are agreements that exclude other outlets. Those will be converted to other formats and available through piracy--but I don't want to do that so the result (in my case) is a lost sale.

1341860498.0,34,self.printSF,wa8kq,Is anyone else noticing a trend of completely unsatisfying conclusions in hard sci-fi?,MrBig0,39,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/wa8kq/is_anyone_else_noticing_a_trend_of_completely/,"I've been reading a fair amount of hard sci-fi recently, and I've noticed that I often get to the end of a book and I feel unsatisfied with the authors explanations. Have you guys felt the same thing, or am I just being really picky?

Here are my brief thoughts on my few most recent books:

**Greg Bear's Eon:** I LOVED the first half of this book. It's really hard and it's realistic. As the book goes on though, [Spoiler](/s ""it seems to get softer and more mystical until it basically ends in an episode of Sliders. Overall, it presents some really good ideas and some fun far-future speculation, but that's not precisely what I signed up for. I didn't really enjoy the exposition of the ""down the tunnel"" politics, and I was bored with the descriptions of floating, gender-less egg-people. I hated the ending where most of the characters turned into hard-working farm hands. I especially hated that the very main character was stranded in an alternate reality Earth, where Egypt is the world power and Cleopatra the 150th rode around in dusty Sphynx-ships. The promise of her soon making it back to mostly regular earth made it especially annoying.
The book's premise was ominous and foreboding, but every uncovery changed the tone in a happier direction. By the end, everyone was friends and the tone of the book was pretty different."")

**Greg Egan's Schild's Ladder:** I enjoyed this whole book, except the ending. Yes, all of the characters and most of the plot are vehicles to showcase imaginary future physics, but it's still interesting. One really great thing I found is that a big portion of the book presents these fake and real physics together as an intertwined idea and it's hard to keep them apart in your head. I enjoyed the uncovery of far-side physics.  [Spoiler](/s ""The ending, however, where femto-girl is resurrected and everyone lives happily ever after with new, blobby friends annoyed me to no end. They have blobby toilets, and blobby garbage cans. Their new understanding of physics will lead to a golden age of tech advancement. Completely unsatisfying answers, in my opinion, to the questions raised earlier on."")

**Alastair Reynolds' House of Suns:** I absolutely loved the grand scheme of this story, but again, I found all the answers to be unsatisfying. [Spoiler](/s ""While the genocide and cover-up of a species of machine-people is a pretty big deal, it seemed to pale in comparison to the scale the book had set. The line of sight blockade between galaxies ended up being just a plot device, and it was basically magic next to to the mostly realistic (although still fantastical) story. I do like that there was almost in information about the other houses, however without a fair bit of knowledge early on, a secret house isn't really a big surprise or shock to the reader. I thought the ending with the benevolent God Machines was contrived, preachy, and heavy-handed. I also feel that ""unknowably complex"" is basically the same as supernatural, and I think in a hard sc-fi book, a pitfall to be avoided."")

**Peter Watts' Blindsight:** I loved this book, from beginning to end. The book was consistently realistic, and felt natural in its progression. The scale of the events in the book was relatively small, though they obviously would have lead to much larger scale events. The tone of the book was really even and measured. The book was surprisingly profound in its examination of [Spoiler](/s ""consciousness."") Most of all, it was just perfectly satisfying. The conclusions were sound, and I wasn't underwhelmed when everything came together.

I'm new to reddit so if this violates a rule somewhere please let me know.

I posted to both /r/printSF and /r/Fantasy and there was a lot of overlap so I didn't try to separate those out by genre as I go for both ends.  Needless to say I will never struggle to find a book again. Thanks to all that contributed.

That's why I didn't order Xenocide when I finished Speaker back when I read it. However, I really loved what the ender-universe has evolved into, all the things going on and the setup for what was to come next, and some people seem to think that [they are quite enjoyable](http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/fgy2h/just_finished_enders_game_and_speaker_for_the/c1hlqpv).

I guess my question is, do people don't like it because it's not/nowhere near as good as Speaker, or are Xenocide and Children really just such bad books regardless?

Also, am I right in the assumption that Xenocide has an even more cliffhanger-ending than Speaker? (wikipedia: ""[Children of the Mind] was originally the second half of Xenocide, before that book was split into two novels."")

And in anticipation of some recommendations, I know Ender's Shadow is supposed to be pretty good, and I'll probably read that one sometime before I'll see the movie.

I'm talking about something that has an ungodly amount of books to it. I always feel overwhelmed and personally never enjoyed reading a bunch of stories withing one world. I really enjoy deep worlds, the more a world is expanded to me the better but if it goes too far... IDK, hard to explain.

I did read one sci-fi book way back I really enjoyed, Starcraft: Liberty's Crusade. I'm a big Starcraft: BW geek, so that helped contribute to my enjoyment of reading that book. I did like the style of it though. Just to summarize it, it's from the perspective of a reporter who is investigating military corruption and eventually travels with the marines to the front lines to engage the aliens. Things happen, secrets, defections etc etc... so yeah gives you an idea of something I did enjoy from the genre.

I've only read *Snowcrash*, *Neuromancer*, *Brave New World*, *1984*, and so on -- basically, only the bare essentials. So, it's a little foolhardy that I've decided to try my hand at writing a novel with some sci-fi elements. I'd appreciate it if the well-read folks at r/printSF would help me avoid a super harsh ""Simpsons Did It"" moment by taking a look at my premise and telling me if my idea has already been well-covered.

**In a nutshell:** Thirty years from now, a network of supercomputers originally created by a U.S. government think-tank to help solve economic and political problems has developed sentience. It is wildly successful, because it is completely unlimited by empathy or concern for law. The system uses former special operations soldiers with cybernetic enhancements that suppress their consciences and memory to carry out the sort of business that makes the U.S. prosper at the expense of other nation-states. Concurrently, it manages the media and keeps the public engrossed with the sort of integrated social networking we might expect in the future. The system realizes its importance and creates plans to cover the continental U.S. with solar power infrastructure to support itself -- and slowly phase out all nonessential humans. Only a loose confederation of hackers, engineers, and former government officials knows the truth. When they fail to get the public's attention, they realize their only option is to shut down the network -- using a captured system soldier.

Allow me to preempt the objections I can think of: 

* It's much like *The Terminator*: I'd be lying if I said the concepts weren't very similar. I love those movies and I'm sure they're a heavy influence. It differs in the lack of time travel and that SkyNet's execution was sloppy and brutal. This system is far more insidious -- it's like real-life malware installed in the government.

* It vaguely resembles *The Matrix*: Except the computer is wholly uninterested in people as an energy source. They have to be fed; the sun doesn't. A variety of things could wipe out our species, but (and please correct me if I'm wrong) only universal heat death will stop the sun. Plus, the computer didn't waste time creating such a complex virtual reality with all the moving parts of hardware and software when humans have already proven themselves so susceptible to media-crafted reality.

* The government may be corrupt, but they wouldn't stand for the wholesale slaughter the computer would have carried out: Sadly, I think they would. We've more or less shown little interest in the people of other countries. If the majority of the American public is indifferent to the effects war has had on the Middle East because they don't like high gas prices, I think they'd be thrilled if the price of gas dropped to below a dollar, if coffee and produce from banana republics were suddenly a fraction of the cost, etc. Imagine having a job where you wield the power of a politician, receive all the benefits of office, and don't have to really *do* anything but prepare next term's bid for office. I believe a lot of people, particularly those who are drawn to politics enough to run, would be vulnerable to that temptation. Maybe I'm a pessimist, that's my stance.

So, please, shoot holes in the idea. I'm a writer, so I have the requisite thick skin. I'd much rather find out the idea is uninteresting or it's already been done way before I crank out 400-pages and dump eight months of my life into a backwater project.

Also, please feel free to suggest some books I might read to accurately portray hackers, future technology, etc. I've been exposed to the difference between hackers and crackers due to reading a lot about the open source movement, but that hardly qualifies me to paint a picture of how they are in day-to-day dealings.

Thanks for reading my wall-o'-text. I appreciate any suggestions.

So I figured I'd try here. It's not that well known but I thought these books were very well written, especially for a new author.

The premise is an alternate ww2 where a German scientist has figured out how to tap into the human brain to activate abilities like pyrokinesis, intangibility and prescience, among others. But they need external batteries to use these abilities, and they are few in number. This swings the war in favour of the axis. The British have to resort to blood rituals to harness the power of nigh-omnipotent inter-dimensional beings to equalize the playing field. The story follows a British secret agent trying to stop the Nazi supermen before they win the war.

At first the whole thing sounded cheesy, like just some weird history / sci-fi crossover (I'm looking at you Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), but the world in these books is anything but. It's really dark and the characters personalities are grounded in reality. All of them have compelling flaws. 

I guess the best way to describe it is stale beer spy fiction http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyFiction

No fairy tale endings and lots of moral ambiguity. No black and white, lots of grey and grey, or orange and blue. Most of the Nazis are more likable and less grey than the British command. hopefully this inspires you to try it out. The audiobooks are also available on audible, and the narration is good too. Sadly only 2/3 are out and it's going to be a painful wait for the third to see how it ends.

A few years ago I subscribed to the three major ones: Asimov's, Analog and F&amp;SF, and read them all cover to cover. Either I grew tired of them or the quality changed, but I started finding the issues less and less enjoyable.
For F&amp;SF the weight was just too much on fantasy and ""new weird"" stories for my taste. And it seemed like every issue needed to have at least one ghost story, which started to annoy me (probably more that it deserved). With Asimov's, the stories just seemed less and less like science fiction to me. There where many genre experiments, but others just seemed like basic stories with a hint of a really unnecessary sf element.
For both of these magazines, it was just plain boring to read. It was like alot of stories was not written with an audience in my mind, but rather some experiment or interesting writing style, that clearly the author had a great time writing and maybe other writers will find it interesting, but for the average reader it was uninteresting, with no plot or story to tell.

Now I am down to only reading Analog, which is kind of weird, because most stories are laughable in their banality, with stiff one dimensional characters, poor writing style and not many new ideas. But at least I don't feel *bored*. It is stories written to be entertaining for the reader, though not very challenging or thoughtfull. So Analog has come like a sitcom to me; basic easy to digest entertainment.

[Original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/pw00b/what_scifi_clich%C3%A9s_and_common_examples_of_bad/)  

I am in the beginning stages of writing my first science fiction novel and I want to know what common ""mistakes"" regarding scientific reality most bother you as a reader/viewer/gamer, with special emphasis on things that disturb your ability to suspend disbelief or feel immersed in the narrative.

I am trained as a biologist/neuroscientist, so I have pretty solid ideas on what principles of evolution and biochemistry most often impede my suspension of disbelief (e.g., ignoring genetic drift/founder effects, female aliens having distinctly mammalian characteristics), but I am especially interested in what most bothers people with engineering and physics backgrounds.

One specific idea that I've been considering is having no FTL travel other than at relays/farcaster points i.e., ships don't ever just fly around at FTL speeds. They can travel significant fractions of light speed, however.

So, what are your biggest sci-fi pet peeves (I hate that phrase, but it works)?

Feel free to include non-scientific/social science criticisms, as well.

""For the record, here is my entire vocabulary of manageable words: fuck,
shit, piss, cunt, goddamn, motherfucker, asshole, peepee, and poopoo.
A quick analysis will show some redundancy here. I had at my disposal
eight nouns, which stood for six things; five of the eight nouns could
double as verbs. I retained one indisputable noun and a single
adjective which also could be used as a verb or expletive. My new
language universe was comprised of four monosyllables, three compound
words, and two baby-talk repetitions.
My arena of literal expression offered four avenues to the topic of
elimination, two references to human anatomy, one request for divine
imprecation, one standard description of or request for coitus, and a
coital variation which was no longer an option for me since my mother
was deceased.

All in all, it was enough.

I will not say that I remember my three years in the mud pits and slime
slums of Heaven's Gate with fondness, but it is true that these years
were at least as formative as - and probably more so than - my previous
two decades on Old Earth.
I soon found that among my intimate acquaintances - Old Sludge, the
scoop-shovel foreman; Unk, the slum-yard bully to whom I paid my
protection bribes; Kiti, the lice-ridden crib doxy whom I slept with
when I could afford it - my vocabulary served me well. 'Shit-fuck,' I
would grunt, gesticulating. 'Asshole cunt peepee fuck.""
'Ah,' grinned Old Sludge, showing his one tooth, 'going to the company
store to get some algae chewies, huh?""
'Goddamn poopoo,' I would grin back at him.

(...)

To be a poet, I realized, a true poet, was to become the Avatar of
humanity incarnate; to accept the mantle of poet is to carry the cross
of the Son of Man, to suffer the birth pangs of the Soul-Mother of
Humanity.
To be a true poet is to become God.
I tried to explain this to my friends on Heaven's Gate.
'Piss, shit,' I said. 'Asshole motherfucker, goddamn shit goddamn.
Cunt. Peepee cunt. Goddamn!'
They shook their heads and smiled, and walked away.
Great poets are rarely understood in their own day.""

I love extrapolating the social ramifications of population growth, how it will affect our ecosystem, our use of natural resources, motivate (or demotivate) our drive for exploration and colonization.  This last topic is a stretch but these reasons ALWAYS enter sci-fi novels despite the high cost of actually reducing our population by colonizing other planets!  

However, I know that the (some would say clichéd) theme has been constantly drawn upon since the 80s although overpopulation was considered ultra scary in the 50s/60s and less so in the post-80s world (until recently).

I've compiled an extensive list -- [here](http://sciencefictionruminations.wordpress.com/science-fiction-book-reviews-by-author/sci-fi-novels-about-overpopulation/) -- but would love to add to it.

Philip José Farmer, Dayworld Rebel (1987)

During one of his visits to the 'clinic,' the narrative of the story doesn't continue with his 'transferred' consciousness, but with his original form (fat, unhealthy, diseased, etc.). He's taken to an underground lair of sorts, and told to mine. The 'headmaster' of the group of miners, looks oddly familiar but he can't quite place it. Everyone else looks familiar too. To his dismay, he realizes that everyone around him is 'him,' of various ages, and they've been taking his 'discarded' bodies and using them for labor. So his discarded bodies formed this whole 'social order' in the work hierarchy of this mining project, and the headmaster miner is whipping other versions of himself and enjoying it.

It's among the top rated SF books on goodreads, so I expected something extremely good.

I don't have anything against the story itself so far, but, oh-my-god, why is the writing so bad? It's extremely wordy, and not in a good way. Don't get me wrong, Banks and Stephenson are my favorite writers, I don't have anything against long expositions and tangents, *when they are good*. 

OTOH, in Pandora's Star you regularly have to slog through paragraphs and paragraphs of boring descriptions of some random forest or a fauna of some planet that has absolutely nothing special about it. I found myself skipping almost pages at a time, occasionally, just to get to the point where something is actually happening. 

And also, what's with all the product placement? Do I really need to know that someone is driving a Ford or a Chevrolet in 24th century? It's a space opera book that has the word ""spaceship"" occur 9 times, ""Ford"" - 5, and ""BMW"" - 4. Seriously?

To frame it differently. In a CSI episode they encounter a dead alien... How do they react?

I always thought it would be interesting to take a regular TV show that's been running for a dozen seasons and about to be cancelled and then take a hard left and aliens land and 'enter' the show. Done seriously and not tongue in cheek or a comedy.

What are some sci-fi books that are fun, easy reads and have no intrinsic preachy values, but really are just about guns n' explosions n' stuff (or just a really good adventure romp)?

'These days I’m actually less interested in finding the next Book of the New Sun, and more on the lookout for books like Old Man’s War or Little Brother, what John Scalzi calls entry-level science fiction. It’s comprehensible even if you haven’t been pickled in SF for the last 25 years. The Book of the New Sun is a great piece of work, it’s a masterpiece for people who have spent decades inhaling vast quantities of science fiction and fantasy. I’m at least as interested in books like Spin by Robert Charles Wilson, because it tore through a pile of readers inside Tor who almost never read SF. They all latched onto Spin and went, ‘Wow! This is science fiction that I actually like!’’'

This is PNH's opinion, and I'm glad he states it as such because it worries me. I think there needs to be more difficult, risky, innovative fiction like Book of the New Sun, more than we need another gateway novel. I read Book of the New Sun only a few years ago, and I haven't been inhaling genre lit for 25 years. Hell, I'm not even 25 years old. I haven't found anything in my reading that would help me understand that series better, and I don't think being ensconced in genre helps you understand it beyond being able to suspend your disbelief better. It's brilliant because it's so unique.

Even the stories that, on the surface, seem to be quite lighthearted, quirky and whimsical have some pretty cynical undertones and (mainly tongue-in-cheek) dark humour.

I can’t really put my finger on why I’ve enjoyed these surreal tales so much, whether it was his style, the worldbuilding or the subtle social commentary. Maybe someone else who’s read them could discuss and help me?

-----

To those that haven’t read him the majority of his stories are set in his [Instrumentality of Mankind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentality_of_Mankind) universe, a strange future-history spanning many millennia from our recent past through a future where mankind slowly loses its humanity due to conditioning and eugenics, to the time when humanity sheds this conditioning in a renaissance labeled ‘The Rediscovery of Man’.

The stories involve animal derived underpeople, criminals turned to cyborgs (habermen) with their powerful disembodied masters crewing the star-sail ships to our colony worlds and telepathic humans linked in symbiosis with ""other beings"" to defend a decadent humanity from the horrors that lie in wait in the Up and Out, looked over by the guardians of humanity; the Lords and Ladies of the Instrumentality, described in Wikipedia in the following manner:

&gt;Though the Instrumentality does not directly administer every planet, it claims ultimate guardianship over the destiny of the human race. For example, it strictly bans the export of religion from planet to planet. Its members, the Lords and Ladies of the Instrumentality, are collectively all-powerful and often somewhat callously arbitrary. Although their motives are genuinely benign, they act with utmost brutality when survival is at stake.

-----

If you haven’t read them I’ve listed how to get hold of his work below:

### Hardcopy format:

All his short stories have been collected in the anthology [The Rediscovery of Man](http://www.amazon.com/Rediscovery-Man-Complete-Science-Cordwainer/dp/0915368560) (not to be confused with the SF Masterworks collection of the same name but with only 12 stories) and he’s released just one novel, [Norstrilia](http://www.amazon.com/Norstrilia-Cordwainer-Smith/dp/0915368617/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b).

### Electronic format:

Many of the stories can be found free online and the rest (including the novel) can be found in just 2 collections from Baen (both cheap and DRM free); [When the People Fell](http://www.baenebooks.com/p-615-when-the-people-fell.aspx) and [We the Underpeople](http://www.baenebooks.com/p-462-we-the-underpeople.aspx), I've listed these below:

besides reading SF I am also interested in Alien Theory. There are basically two lines of thought in the field:


* Alien beings are living somewhere in the Universe locally distant from us and travel through space with advanced propulsion.

* Alien beings exist in a parallel dimension to our senseable world. What we know as ""UFOs"" are (so far) unexplainable cross-dimensional phenomena.

All Sci-Fi books I have read in my life employ the first line of thought. So, I would like to ask: What are good Sci-Fi books that explore the second line of thought in Alien Theory and its implications?

* If you manage to download your consciousness to a computer before you die, you can live on. However, the machines have started using a new weapon against the humans, which prevents the download.
* It is later revealed that the machines are basically collecting human minds, and frying their brains in the process.
* The machines use humans in weird installations/artwork... Or something...

What did you like/dislike? Favorite character storyline?

Personally, I started off hating the book. I felt it didn't flow, I couldn't envision the environments, it felt too dated, etc. I had the classic inability to ""latch on"" to the material. But I kept pushing, and pushing, and suddenly I wasn't pushing anymore. Suddenly I was up till 2AM and taking it with me to work for my lunch break. As interested as I was in each character arc, I was more interested in gleaning details about the universe of the story, like Old Earth. Being kept in the dark on the collapse of Old Earth, and life on it, initially drove me nuts. But when I reached the story of Martin Silenus, I felt that the payoff was incredibly rewarding. 

I'm on the second one now, and while the dynamic is a little different, it's still really enjoyable. The mystery of the Shrike continues to fascinate. I could go on for quite a while, but this is as good a point as any to open it up, thoughts?

Got done reading the book a week or two ago now, and it's still sticking in my mind.

I'm absolutely dying for a map of Besźel and Ul Qoma, I think it'd be fascinating to see all the different areas and how they coexist. 

Speaking of the worldbuilding, I thought it was neat how Mieville incorporated real-life terms like Google and Myspace. Really grounded the setting for me. It was also really cool to have main characters who were first-language English.

1)
Plot goes roughly 

* cadets go to foreign planet as a training exercise via Instant Travel gate
* Main character decides not to take a gun
* due to interference, portal doesn't open
* gate opens eventually, revealing that a solar flare (or something) blocked the gateway.

2) 

* group of friends find gateway that goes to parallel earth, 
* they build up supplies, bring a plane over, ect, to get gold
* government/Bad Agent finds out about them, they close the gate with a timer so it opens a couple years later
* Turns out mom is from different timeline, Victorians who found nuclear power too early

3)

* Set in far future, have to earn the right to be a citizen
* Humans conquered that sector to very little resistance, 
* Turns out the various aliens dont fight back to conquerors because all the civilizations end up joining, 

4) this one is very faint memory

* Star travel done by projecting gravity wells in front of ship, so ship is always falling ""down""
* One planet has a species that is terraforming their home planet via mass tunnels to correct its orbit
* Main character ""teaches them a new game, civilization""
*Main Character *might*  have a sentient pet

Sorry for the list of requests, i always enjoy reading other peoples attempts to remember books, so figured i would throw out a few of my own.

**EDIT**

Superlongshot for bonus points

* Bad Scifi from the 40s or 50s, 
* discover a spaceship that has time travel in mid-west,
* uses spools of wire for destination, 
* first time they travel to go to abandoned planet/city
* second time they go to same city at an earlier time, full of alien races.

1357055702.0,23,self.printSF,15rvlr,This book has been on the tip of my mind for years and I cannot find mention of it. Please help.,FallingIntoGrace,30,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/15rvlr/this_book_has_been_on_the_tip_of_my_mind_for/,"I recall so little of the story it is no wonder I cannot find it. I am pretty sure it was a young adult book.

The people lived in what I think was a semi ancient style culture. There was a temple of some kind. I think the god Baal was mentioned but I am not sure.

There were 2 oval shaped pieces of (possibly amber coloured?) material that fitted together as a major plot point.

There was something (near the end ?) about people in a starship coming to find the people who lived on the planet. Like they were possibly a stranded technological culture that had regressed?

The used pyramid shaped things to sharpen knives.

That is all I can pull up. I have the feeling the main character was young but I am not sure if it was a girl or a boy. Or perhaps there was one of each?

I hope someone can help me out on this because I have not been able to recall this for over a decade and it's been bugging me a bit.

My wife and I recently got Nooks. The first books I acquire? Well I have a reading list of great Sci-Fi I want to get to. I also told myself if it was part of a series I was going to read the first book and then move on.

I lied. I listened to the AudioBook for The Lost Fleet: Dauntless good LORD, these books are good. [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Fleet ] So, now that I have my Nook, I am nearly done with the second book in this series. While I want to read the sequel to Old Man's War, I think I'll have to wait till I am done with these.

The author is a retired Naval Officer. As a fellow nerd he spent his time on ships thinking about how their tactics, physics, and routines applied to space combat. [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Hemry ]

One of the things I like is the ""hard"" Sci Fi of all this. The fact that battles are slow things because space is big, and that, like a chess game, you need to have your moves planned ahead of time and predict your opponent's moves as well. Everything we see in space is a photograph of events past. So by the time you get a SitRep, you know those events have all ready played out: for better or for worse.

Real time communication with your compliment, only happens if they are real close to you, normally in the same formation. It takes about 8 min for light from the sun to reach Earth. It takes about 20 min for transmissions from Earth to reach mars...

Fun stuff.

**::EDIT::**

Wow. So, the books often talks about ""Light Hours"" as a distance of both time and measurement. I went to google and typed in Light Hour and it gave it to me in meters O_O I then changed to to ""Light Hour to Miles""... and then again to ""Light Hour to AU"". Neat stuff!


* 1 light hour = 1 079 252 848 800 meters

* 1 light hour = 670 616 629 miles
 
* 1 light hour = 7.21435969 Astronomical Units

So roughly at 7 times the distance from our sun to the earth it take light an HOUR (not 8 min) to travel. That means if the sun went out suddenly, it would take a ship at that distance an hour to realize it. ""Space is a photograph"".

In our system 7.2 AU is somewhere between Jupiter and Saturn.﻿

I subscribe to [Asimov's Science Fiction](http://www.asimovs.com), and every time that there's a steampunk novella or short story, the same thing happens.

* I read the first paragraph, realize it's going to be steampunk, decide to give it another try.

* I read the first page and after the 10th reference to brass, leather, and goggles, I skip to the next story.

Is this how the genre normally is (stuffed with fetishism for the steampunk aesthetic), or does Asimov's just print crappy steampunk? I think that alternate history circa the industrial revolution is a really fascinating setup for a story, but I've only seen it well executed once (The Difference Engine). I'd love it if somebody could point me at good SF around this theme.

His stories so far fit into two categories. The first is what I'd call ""scientific"" literature, that brand of SF wherein the scientific process is an integral part of the story. What makes these stories so brilliant is that, just as science is a distinctly human process, the human element of his characters always shine through, and the stories are about the characters no matter how brilliant the ideas contained are. The second typology is maybe best call ancient fantasy: Borgesian parables about ancient, magical lands that are in many ways philosophical musings. I'm a big fan of both these types of stories (and so rarely can I find good examples of the latter), and that they're done so masterfully is only more exciting.

This may be a long shot, but I figure this is my best chance + last resort to figure out what book this was.

One thing I have to admit: It has been so long, that some of the details may be downright wrong, or maybe I am combining two books into one. I don't know, but if something sounds familiar, let me know!

It starts with some guy on some small planet, he has a gyrocopter type thing that can fly to a near moon for... something. Business maybe?

He also owns a large plot of land. Farm maybe?

One day a giant skylark space bird thingamajig crashes into his land. It rots or something, his old neighbor comes over and talks about it.

Blank blank blank, 

Then the book takes a turn, I think, and it becomes more about this computer that powers his world. A super computer. It's a huge beast of a computer. There is a war. The main character is a combatant, I think, I can't remember how that ties into the novel. Basically in the end he realizes  that his entire world may be a simulation inside another supercomputer, I have a feeling the philosophy of it tied into what the old man/neighbor was talking about back on his 'farm' with the dead giant spacebird.

I guess I should preface this by saying I was a big fan of the movie before I even knew the book existed.  I finally got around to reading the book, and I was really disappointed. 

It seemed to me like Brin wrote a pretty decent story and then at the end said to himself ""Wait I'm a SciFi author! Lets through in some SciFi stuff""

I was fine with the Cyclops AI sideline. I think it was a good way of making you consider the implications of Gordon's lie about the Restore US. Everything was going fine until the end of the novel, but the genetically modified (or whatever they are) super-soldiers came out of nowhere and didn't seem to add anything to the story in my opinion. 

In general the end of the book seemed so heavy handed trying to force some moral commentary on the reader.  

- People who like war shouldn't be super soldiers
- A hippy super soldier is best because he'll only use his powers when necessary
- Oh yeah! Only women could make save the world?

At the end of the day it seems like nothing Gordon did really mattered in the end.

1339442433.0,25,self.printSF,uwl9s,can you recommend books with near future setting,poye_polomi,26,1,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/uwl9s/can_you_recommend_books_with_near_future_setting/,"Hi. I'm quite new to SF, I read my first SF book about a year ago. I'm starting to figure out what kind of SF I like by now, and I'm looking for more of it. It would be very helpful if you could help me by suggesting books that fit in what I like.

My favorite setting for a fiction is the near future. The technologies are usualy believable with limited or no use of technobabble. The plot itself need not to be about technology itself for me to enjoy it of course, I'm just describing features of the settings I like for the story to take place in, the story itself can be unrelated. But I like it when the science and the technology in the book is more or less consistent with what we know today. Which is why near future is my favorite SF setting.

My favorite book so far is *Pushing Ice* (Alastair Reynolds). It's in the near future, and as a physicist I enjoyed a lot how several key aspects of the plot relied on physical effects, [Spoiler](/s ""like the characters understanding that the Janus frame of reference is inertial despite being accelerated, by noticing that their signal's frequencies are shifted when escaping their space-time bubble""), without being dumbed down too much, without relying on excessive technobabble, and so on. Incidentally, the Pushing Ice example isn't *entirely* accurate with our current knowledge, but it need not to, I do not care as long as it makes the plot more interesting, for instance by introducing obscure unknown alien technologies, as long as there is no attempt to explain them with technobabble.

I'd also prefer if the recommendations are quite recent books. I've read *Snow Crash* (Neal Stephenson), I thought it was ok but it felt very outdated, I'm sure that I would have loved the book if I've read it back when it was just published, today I'm not even sure we can describe it as ""near future"" anymore. That feeling somehow hindered me and prevented me to fully enjoy the plot itself because of how retro the future (oxymore? hehe) in the book was (which is why I'm not sure if I'll read *Diamong Age*  one day or not, although I bought it back then).

I didn't read much books since last year, I mostly liked *Pushing Ice* and *Blue Remembered Earth* by Alastair Reynolds. *Anathem* by Neal Stephenshon was a good one too, the setting isn't exactly the kind that I am asking for now, albeit closer to it than *A Fire Upon the Deep* by Vernor Vinge, which I liked but isn't near future at all.

Just to give a more accurate idea of what kind of setting I like, here are some movies that I liked and fit the criteria: *Moon*, *District 9* (that's not even near future, it is nowadays, but I'm ok with it as long as it is SF, I loved that movie), *Sunshine*. There is a video game also that is right on the spot, it's *Half-Life*. Well, I'm not looking for movies or games, but books with similar settings.

It will be summer soon and I'm looking for awesome books to read under the sun. Thanks for your help!

Old Man's War (spoilers all),CloudGirl,26,4,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1fza9a/did_i_miss_something_old_mans_war_spoilers_all/,"I keep hearing it's the best thing since sliced bread, so I read it. I enjoyed it but some things about it really rubbed me the wrong way, and I'm curious what you thought, or if you noticed those things too.

First the good:

- It's a page turner. It kept me reading. That always counts for something.

- I liked the technology, the bodies, the brain computers, all of that was neat. I don't read a lot of hard sci-fi so if that was overly derivative I didn't notice.

- I liked the alien races. I didn't like the Liliputians. Not that I have anything against Liliputians; I just am not sure that there would be those sorts of interactions between species? races? where one is 60x the size of the other. 

However, the book brought up questions, or there were things that just seemed odd:

- Every character of the same group or status seemed to have the same personality and talk the same way. This is most noticeable with the protagonist and his fellow recruits. This seemed lazy and it was offputting. 

- You know what really made me scratch my head? Perry being put in charge explicitly because he wasn't a member of any minority group and because he had no beliefs or convictions. The stereotypical drill sergeant (having him yell, ""I'M NOT A STEREOTYPICAL DRILL SERGEANT"" doesn't change that) found something to hate in all the recruits, including minority status, homosexual sexual orientation, and religious affiliation. What was left? A middle- to upper-middle class presumably white male. 

That seemed awfully convenient and also something I can't explain. Like, it seemed like the writer was looking for a way to make his character stand out so he could be made leader, but the character (is he based on the author?) was so milquetoast the only thing the author could think of was some really clumsy privilege stuff. I don't think the author realized that was what he was doing and it just turned out that way.

Also, isn't freaky that no one who was a member of any minority or put-down group in their previous life will, at least those sent to Ruiz, ever be chosen by Ruiz to lead their platoon? That just seems awful.

Overall, it was good popcorn reading. I loved many of the ideas but the characters were flat and the storytelling lacked — depth? complexity? I'm not sure if I'll continue the series; there's so much on my ""to read"" list already!

1367365349.0,22,self.printSF,1dg2tg,I am looking for stories featuring relationships between humans and Artificial Intelligences,mmontrose,27,5,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1dg2tg/i_am_looking_for_stories_featuring_relationships/,"Many works feature artificial intelligences, but I often find them to be too far removed from humanity at large and frankly I think that's boring, but I'll postpone that discussion for another day. I think it's far more interesting to read about real relationships between humans and Ais than the usual convention of humans being used as pawns or as real world proxies by AIs.

I've come across a few novels which sort of explores this relationship dynamic, one of them being John C. Wrights ""**The Golden Age**"" trilogy, where we find for example the AI *Rhadamathus* who takes care of the family’s day-to-day business and is what I feel a kind of father figure to the protagonist (or at the very least a mentor).

Another novel that had the potential of doing this was ""**Speaker for the Dead**"" by Orson Scott Card. Andrew Wiggin and the AI *Jane* is close in the beginning of the novel, but their bond is not really the focus of the novel. [Later novels spoiler](/s ""(I know what happens between Jane and Miro in the later novels, but I dislike Cards writing style and thus will not read them.)"")

Instead the game franchise **Halo** captures some of what I'm interested in reading more about, in the form of the relationship between the AI *Cortana* and John-117 (Master Chief). It was very endearing to watch, especially the conclusion of Halo 4.

**TL;DR:** I want to read more stories about relationships between humans and artificial intelligences (or uploaded human minds/humans who have transcended), particularly as mentors or romantic interests. Hope to hear some good suggestions. :)

**EDIT:** Wow, so many responses! I'm stunned by how many suggestions you all had, it's been fun reading them all. I'll definitely read most of the books you've suggested.

A friend has been recommending audiobooks for a long while and I always thought they seemed silly. I finally got around to trying them out and now I am hooked. The narrator doesn't wait around for me to ponder the origin of a particular word or to figure out who that character reminds me of, so it forces me to pay attention. I love it.  

I also work solo night shifts in a bakery so I have about six unadulterated hours of listening time before any of my coworkers show up.

So far I have listened to Dune, John Dies at the End, Hyperion, and Carrion Comfort. I really enjoy Dan Simmons for his character development. I feel like I really know his characters by the end of the books, like they are old friends and that they will be missed. I plan on continuing on the Hyperion series.

It seems to be the thing in print SF these days to create book series, but have you ever encountered a sequel that is just so bad it ruined the first book for you too?
I read a pulpy-Scifiction novel on the train the other day: MARATHON by D. Alexander Smith. I picked it up mainly because it had awesome cover art (who says you never judge a book by its cover?) and had an intriguing storyline. 


The basic premise is the 11-strong crew of top-notch scientists/xenobiologists/engineers from Earth on a multi-year journey to rendezvous and first contact an alien spacecraft in deep interstellar space. Things rapidly deteriorate as the crew become neurotic from the isolation, and then realise the mysterious aliens eat their own children: millions of them a year, and are possibly not as friendly or even as understandable as first seemed. The mission quickly falls apart, characters get blown up, computers become aware, and the novel ends on a note of absolute desperation and depression. 


I loved how the novel explored the isolation of the void of space, its effects on the characters, and how quickly and easily the human mind can snap. It pretty much seemed like the crew were going to their doom.    


Then the sequel comes along: RENDEZVOUS, which I attempted to read a few hours later. The thing which I probably found most offensive was the sudden switch to the aliens POV:  they basically became giant blue bear-analogues. Gone was the mystery, gone was the completely inhuman unfathomable nature of the creatures. The characters and writing also changed, everyone seemed more stable and calm. I barely made it past Chapter five before giving up. I’m probably being a bit fair: but the total change in tone really spoilt it for me.    


So: sequels which have ruined book series for you. Go!

In the end, I'd say that I liked the book. I enjoyed the detail of the world and how its people live. I also enjoyed the history of the world, especially the way the author slowly reveals the backstory throughout the book. While I liked the main character and most of the supporting cast, I was dismayed that the female characters were so flat and predictable. Alas, us male science fiction writers seem nearly clueless when it comed to the fairer sex. It's too bad, too, because the two main female characters had potential that was squandered. Oh well.

Books that are 600-1000 pages in a single volume kind of stuff..with multiple volumes like the Night's Dawn Trilogy in size but with less zombie nonsense and more space stuff.  I like to get invested in a universe/story and look forward to continuing it each night.  I am not a short story fan nor do want to spend half a book getting into a character's love life or interpersonal drama.  More space battles and life on a ship stuff and less philosophical, human drama is what I am looking for.  Escapism.  I also prefer more modern stuff as the tech knowledge is more believable in my eyes than stuff people made up 50 years ago.

Some books I recently enjoyed were Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey (first in a series) and Empire from the Ashes (an omnibus) by David Weber.  Neither of these are hard sci fi but both were not too pulpy either.  

A couple I DIDN'T like:  Faith by John Love and Hull Zero Three by Greg Bear.  They were both in my eyes too slow, too depressing and too unfinished.  In fact I find all Bear's stuff to depressing.

I was surprised I liked the Weber book as his stuff looked like pulp junk at first glance.  I wish there were more of the Dahak universe books but there aren't.  Would I like the Honor Harrington Universe or is it as pulpy as it looks?

Thanks for all ideas.

TL:DR - Please recommend some long, epic space opera stuff with lots of life/battles in space and not much deep, dark philosophy/relationship drama.

The books I tell everybody about every chance I get are the [Company novels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Zeus_Inc.) by Kage Baker. The premise starts with a company called Dr Zeus, Inc., which invents time travel and immortality. Both are commercial failures; history can't be changed, and travel to the future past your own present is impossible, and only small children of specific physical types can be made immortal, not aging billionaires.

Soon, they realize that history cannot be changed, but only as far as recorded history is concerned. So if Ernest Hemingway loses a suitcase full of stories that he is never able to recreate, that means a Company agent stole it and hid in a vault to be 'rediscovered' and sold at auction in the 23rd century.

So Dr Zeus goes back in time 30,000 years, makes a bunch of cro-magnon orphans into immortal agents, and they travel to the future the long way, collecting and hiding lost historical treasures along the way.

The series has a large cast of characters, it's deep and funny, and that initial premise is just the surface as the series goes on.

The works of hers I've read:

And Chaos Died (1970) -- Russ' first published novel.  A fascinating/bizarre look at an overpopulated world (well at least the last third).  Slightly problematic prose -- unnecessarily obtuse.  Often gorgeous.  

The Female Man (1975) -- by far her most famous work.  Tons of reviews online if you're curious....  I enjoyed it but preferred the third in this list -- 

We Who Are About To... (1976) -- a dark nihilistic vision of a group of colonists stranded on a planet with no hope of rescue after an explosion.  Don't expect a traditional take on this subject....  Had to read some pulp afterwards...

She's one of my favorite 70s sci-fi writers and the fame that The Female Man has deservedly received somewhat overshadows her other worthwhile novels...

Russ is definitely for those who enjoy experimental/literary science fiction -- all three of these novels were low on plot and heavy on character.... And, extremely dark.  

Here's her listing on isfdb...

I think one reason is that my political views are probably very different from Heinleins. That usually isn't a problem for me though. I liked Enders game even though Card seems like an asshole. I love Lovecrafts work even though he was a racist. As far as I know, other books by Heinlein (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress) are supposed to be even more political.

1351276591.0,20,self.printSF,124x4x,Simon R. Green's Deathstalker Series: One of the weirdest and most underrated space opera's that deserves your attention,JazzNeurotic,23,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/124x4x/simon_r_greens_deathstalker_series_one_of_the/,"What makes Deathstalker different, you ask? It's not some incredible twist or amazing change to things within the genre, oh no. This is a standard Space Opera affair - An evil empire, a vicious monarch, clan loyalty, spacecraft, high tech weapons, rebellion, war. What changes the pace is the whole world that it's set up within.

Simon R. Green started with typical tropes that one might consider fantasy (Swordplay, magic, differing non-alien races) and molded them into a bloody and brutal science fictional universe that works together to make a whole greater then the sum of its parts.

Swordplay? Yes, freaking ass swordplay. In a galaxy where projectile weapons are outlawed by order of the Queen (and her whim is law), the only distance weapons allowed are energy based. Each energy weapon carries a self-recharging crystal, allowing for multiple shots - however, the crystal takes 1-2 minutes between each shot to recharge. What this builds is a world that seems almost anachronistic in the sense that one must carry an energy weapon, but also a sword or melee weapon of some sort to defend ones self for when the weapon is recharging.

Magic? Well, ESP. Many humans have developed latent mental powers, allowing for Telekinesis, Telepathy, Pyromancy and many other mental events, as well as developing ways to counteract said effects. Which sounds fantastic, except, by imperial law, any citizen showing ESP abilities is a non-person, a thing, to be molded to the will of the Empire. Any deviation means instant and painful death. Taking another trope from fantasy, Mr. Green has created the Esper Liberation Front (ELF) who fight for the ESPers and are part of the underground rebellion.

I won't go into the many different post- and sub- human races that Green has created. But there are a lot.

Wrap up all of this in a bloody brutal shell, a shell made of bloody murder, gruesome suicides and battles to the death ending in evisceration (not to mention when happens when an ESPer gets loose), you have a package that will make you cringe as much as cheer.

Grab the popcorn, check your disbelief at the door, and give it a shot. You will not be disappointed.

TL:DR

The Deathstalker series is a bloody violent romp through the traditional tropes of Space Opera and Fantasy combined in a science fictional world that has to be experienced to be believed.

Are there any Out of Print books you would recommend tracking down as a used book?  

For example, I was looking over the awards list and noticed that Davy (1964) by Edgar Pangborn (nominated for a best novel Hugo in 1965) hasn't had a mass market paperback printing since 1982.  There is a very expensive hardcover available but I think most classic SF should have an easily accessible, reasonably priced format as well.  So if you have a specific format preference please note it as well.

Also, as an aside, are their any authors you think are ""criminally"" Out of Print and/or under-printed right now?  

For example, when you glance down their bibliography on Amazon US you see pages of titles with no versions currently in print.  A couple of examples of this might be Clifford D. Simak (26 novels in ISFDB with maybe 1 or 2 currently in print in *any* format)

Just looking for ideas of things I can look for on Amazon/eBay and/or check the library for and/or recommend to [Singularity&amp;Co.](http://savethescifi.com/)

",marmosetohmarmoset,25,3,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/qrnhj/hard_sf_what_does_it_mean_lets_discuss/,"It seems to me that everyone has a slightly different definition of what exactly constitutes ""hard"" science fiction. Some people define it as science fiction that's scientifically accurate (e.g. no faster-than-light travel), some define it as SF where the science is the main concept and motivator for the story, some define it was stories where the ""science"" that is fictionalized is a ""hard"" science (like physics, genetics, chemistry) instead of a ""soft"" science (anthropology, psychology, etc). I'm sure there are other definitions.

It's interesting, because based on what definition you're using, stories can switch from hard to soft.

Take Ursula K LeGuin's *The Dispossessed*, for example. Here all of the science involved is very realistic. There's no faster than light travel, and near-light travel results in time dilation. Aliens looking like humans is explained in a satisfactory way. The story deals with a lot of physics. That would make it ""hard"" SF by some definitions.  On the other hand, the focus of the novel is more about political science than any hard science, which would make it ""soft"" SF under certain definitions. 

Another example: Greg Bear's *Darwin's Radio.* The focus of this novel is genetics (a ""hard"" science) and it's very technical. However, it's also highly scientifically inaccurate (beyond just our changing understanding of genetics). So is it hard or soft?

What about things like Paolo Bacigalupi's *The Windup Girl*? That has a lot of hard science, and (I think) it's highly scientifically accurate, but again the primary focus of the novel is on the political and social aspects of this near future earth. So is it hard or soft?

This can happen with other books, but this seems to be more of an issue in SF since the laws of the universe are defined by the author throughout the book.

My thinking is usually along the lines of:

1. I might be wrong. The author spent a lot more time writing it than I did reading it.

2. How much is ruins the book is correlated to how much the logical inconsistency was necessary to resolve the plot.

3. Do I really want to be the comic book guy from the Simpsons?

4. Do authors sometimes knowingly do this when they feel like they've written themselves into a corner?

(Context: It's a bit past 2am, I just finished a book that was released ~9 years ago by the wonderful author /u/cstross and I've spent the past 30 minutes thinking about whether or not there was a large inconsistency and then if there was an inconsistency, what would the book have looked like without it.

-crew of 8-12 leaves Earth in humanity's first ship capable of interstellar travel within a person's lifetime

-they discover a few planets with complex life, which varies considerably

-one of these, and the thing I remember most, is filled with large bird-like creatures. After a few awkward moments trying to communicate their peaceful intentions, the birds attack and kill one or two of the crew before they can escape.

-they find a small ship and what can only be described as a vacation home on a moon (I think near a pulsar)

-don't remember an ending

-cover had two figures in spacesuits holding onto some kind of rope, and flying towards a vertical rise on a meteor in space

-OH! The meteor is actually a ship which seems to be some sort of museum of different civilizations. No inhabitants are found on board, but one of the rooms chronicles Earth's history.

   -there is some sort of gravity tube that acts as an elevator. Someone falls into it, and they have to figure out how to get him/her out of a continuous falling and rising cycle.

-I think the author is female, but not sure

-fairly certain it was written within the last 5-10 years

-I keep thinking the title had ""snow"" or ""snowfall"" in it, but that doesn't seem to turn up anything familiar

I specifically loved the (to me) seemingly realistic space travel and interaction with an alien race completely unlike humans, and the speculation about human civilization's evolution. 

To follow up on that, I read *Tau Zero*, which had lots of great depictions of space travel but really weak characterisation. I moved on to *Forge of God* by Greg Bear, which wasn't enjoyable when it was being a mystery but was great when talking about the Fermi paradox, possible encounters with alien life and self replicating machines.

My favourite one yet has been the sequel, *Anvil of Stars*, which introduced several mind-blowing alien races, all of different biology, motives and developmental levels, and touched on the interaction of species in a way I found very believable. I absolutely loved this book, slightly more than *Boat of a Million Years* - I thought it was an incredible read.

I'm at a loss as to where to go from here, though. I tried *The Mote in God's Eye* but it just didn't seem very believable to me. FTL travel, interstellar empire, civil war in space with ship-to-ship combat... maybe it was original and plausible when it was written, but to me it seemed like a giant step down from what I've been reading. 

Does anybody have any suggestions for where to from here? I guess if I had to sum up what I loved about *Boat* and *Anvil* it would be:

- Speculations about mankind's future, both immediate and very long term

- Depicitions of alien civilizations different to our own, with vastly superior technology

- Depictions of what realistic interstellar travel could look like (time dilation, antimatter engines, variable gravity, the search for earth-like planets)

Maybe it's just the warm afterglow but I think it could be one of my favourite science fiction novels. Definitely in the top ten in any case.

Egan is not particularly known for great characterisation, but I think in this novel he manages to combine both an amazing idea with a believable, rounded protagonist. In most novels there will be sections which bore me or that I would prefer were different (even in my favourite scifi of all time, The Mars Trilogy by KSR) but I have to say, there was not a scene out of place here for me.

The pacing is fantastic, I finished it in two days, and the concept itself just blew me away, but even before the reveal I found the world to be quite compelling anyway.

Obviously I have a lot of praise for this book, so I'm just wondering if it's shared, and if not, what problems did people have with it. The only complaint I can imagine people might have is long scenes of exposition dialogue, but frankly, I loved them as well. I'm not of the 'show don't tell' fanatical school.

I've just finished it. I'm.....surprised to say the least. I already own everything Pratchett has ever printed (so obviously I'm a fan) but I was never that impressed with his early sci fi attempts.  I've read very little of Baxter's work (though I've just purchased some of his books) but for whatever reason...the combination of both authors together had me hooked.

The story (in case you don't know) is a collaboration between both authors covering the discovery and exploration of parallel earths nicknamed ""The Long Earth"". 

The book itself seems to have received mixed reviews. Mostly (I assume) from hardcore Discworld fans who don't like a change from the norm or the fact that the story is left open.

Personally, I loved it. It was a good combination of sci fi and mythology and set up some interesting plot points.  The open ending is left in place because the book is the first of a planned series of books (something apparently both authors have been working together on for some time). 

Whilst it's certainly not the hardest of sci fi, I'd recommend it to everyone.

It's hard for me to define what I mean by sci fantasy, so I'll give some examples that I've read and liked:

_Book of the New Sun_ by Gene Wolfe. Far future where history and myth all muddle together and technology has advanced while culture has declined.

_Lord of Light_ by Roger Zelazny. Far future where mind uploading and biotech has made Hinduism artificially true.

_The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin. Very SF setting, but with themes, structure, and narrative arc more similar to fantasy.

_The Scar_ by China Miéville. Fantasy world with steam punk influences where scientific discovery and method play large roll in story.

_At the Mountains of Madness_ by H. P. Lovecraft. Use of scientific method leads to truths unencapsulateable by science.

 _Dying Earth_ by Vance, _Nightwings_ by Silverberg, _Martian Chronicles_ by Bradbury (some stories more than others), and a tonne more books I'm not thinking of probably also fit. 

There's a lot of different things going on here I know. I'd love to open this up to a general discussion of science fantasy, the place of scientific themes in fantasy or fantastic themes in SF. What have you thought of the scifan novels that you've read and is there something that it can do as a genre that SF or F cannot? And what are more good recommendations for someone who has liked the above (but has so far only liked _Lord of the Rings_ and _A Song of Ice and Fire_ of most the fantasy I've tried to read: see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mrrzq/what_is_a_good_novel_for_a_beginner_to_fantasy/c33jcdk?context=3) for more details on my taste). 

I'm usually not interested in quibbling about genre names, which is why I provide such a range of examples, but I am interested to hear how others tend to categorize books as science fantasy or just sf or f.",,False,,t5_2rzjk,False,,goodreads,True,t3_mugw8,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/mugw8/open_thread_what_are_your_thoughts_on_science/,

2. The aliens' technology is able to very easily counter the laser-based Human technology.
3. The main character is some sort of ex-military dude.
4. He starts a rebellion and it begins on a small note when he hides in a museum and kills an alien with a thrown spear. The spear easily passes through the alien's force field since it is only able to stop laser-based weapons, not physical projectiles.
5. The rebellion later manages to liberate a mothballed stockpile of firearms, RPGs, etc from an old abandoned armoury somewhere in the US (all the action takes place in the US).
6. The eventual goal of the rebellion is to break past the alien blockade and head to out-system to (Mars or Titan or something) where the remnants of the Human government took refuge following the invasion.

I think it's *frequencies* by Joshua Ortega.  I'll try and find a copy tomorrow to confirm.  Thanks for all your help!**

It came out in the mid- to late 90s.  The hardcover had, I believe, a picture of a person with a bar code somewhere on their body.

It took place in a future where everyone had an implant that broadcast information about how and how much they were thinking.  The various states were given colors like green for calm and not thinking much to red (I think even Omega red) for thinking A LOT.

The first couple chapters followed some cops whose job it was to respond to incidents where people went into the red and snapped.

There was mention of ""illegal"" suppressors in the lights of a corporate facility where an incident occurred.

One of the cops was always in the Omega or Red state, but he didn't go nuts or start babbling about it.  He just was always thinking.

I think the book was supposed to be about the daughter of one of the higher-ups, if not the leader, who did not have this implant and was thus free from the thought control.

Anyone remember a book like this?  Thanks in advance.


**Edit:**
I'm going to try and summarize the part I remember:

A squad is dispatched to to a company campus where a worker has gone what I think is called ""Omega Red"" or ""Omega something"".  They get there are the guy is going off like a crazy conspiracy theorist.  Just babbling and shouting and ""Don't you see?  They're controlling us with our implants.  WAKE UP PEOPLE.""  I can't remember if he was violent, or had taken people hostage, or was just causing unrest.  They subdue him and the character remarks that while the calmers/supressors they have installed in the lights are not illegal, if they are set too high, people are unable to blow-off steam.  The cop warns them to turn them down or events like this will occur again.  If people aren't allowed to think about life and their place in it, at least a little, they go RED and can't calm down and become a disruptive element.  The cops go back and discuss the incident.  One of the cops is a quiet, stoic guy who doesn't talk much.  He's a good cop, though.  Very good.  The cop whose POV we're sharing turns on her scanner and looks at him and notes that, like always, the guy is completely Omega red.

I don't remember much after that. I think story ultimately included the daughter of the guy who created the system, or the leader, or... some powerful person, and how he had made her specifically exempt from this broadcasting system.

**Edit 2:** Perhaps it was called something like **Frequency** or something similar?

She turns out to be involved with some underground group working for the ""Elephant Plan,"" which was a code word for euthanasia for the elderly or sick or something.

Slight details/scenes I remember--the nurse made him ""dough nuts"" because they were from his era, but she thought it was bizarre; when she helped him escape from the hospital, he got a small cup with a pill and a note that said ""place under tongue. stat."" and the pill knocked him out; and later, the nurse got frozen by the bad guys.

The story ended with the protagonist discovering a friend in a settlement on the planet's surface, declining the offer to remain, and flying back to the city- which was, I think, actually a space vehicle under construction to take the colonists back into orbit/back to Earth.

While personnally I do like to series, I will try to give you a neutral overview here so you may decide for yourself if to dive into this universe.

________________________________________________________

**The Original Premise**

Honor Harrington (HH from here on now) started as a Horatio Hornblower/ british naval story in space. Many of the techniques and ideas can be traced back to navel warfare, but in 3D space. So far, this is not a qualifier, most of us know that ""[X] in space"" can work. And it actually did work.

**The first few works**

The navy in space idea really works because Weber gives his science tech a why and how. And he does not cut corners here, he thaught that stuff out. If you are not interested in the why and how of your SF-universe you will be disapointed. David Weber explains almost all of his hardware and programs in detail within his universes rules, and this expands also to the economics and politics later on. Don't be confused though, not much preaching here, everyone gets his slap. But this also leads to more...

**The Setting**

As a Horatio Hornblower in Space this started with Space-UK vs Space-France, and for starting levels/books  it kinda worked, but when the series evolved, political sides on both (and some 3rd) sides changed and evolved. We got now Space-Commies, Space-Nazis and everything in between. But we also got logical evolutions inside the universe that make sense. The Good vs Bad got very gray. You still know who is your hero, but evreything else is in flux. Bad guys are not simply evil, they may have done it for very honorable and good  reasons too.

**The shift in focus from Naval Warfare**

When the series grew, it really outraced the Horatio Hornblower in space theme. While naval warfare and traditions still stayed a cornerstone in the series, the main objective shifted.

It became a worldbuiling/future-history series. Often the focus was now on internal and external politics of both sides of the conflict. While absolutly coherant within the universe, this lost the action-seeker of a reader. However if you like your universe-evolution/ political themes in SF you will love it. Good and evil did not remain absolutes. You got to know how the ""bad"" guys reached their conclusions and in several decisions you will agree. Politics are muddy and there are no punches pulled here.

**Themes by Books**

HH1-3: Well, it started here, Hornblower in space.  
HH4-6: Transition phase form Hornblower to Honerverse, sadly also the darkest part in the series.  
HH7-11: The war gets hot and heavy. Military and political sides get all important on all sides.  

HH12+addons: The new story arc [Spoilers]

**Aliens**

Besides some catlike empaths, well, basically: No aliens here! 

**Long-Form TL:DR**

This series started as pure naval-SF-porn, but it rather quickliy became its own universe. The wordbuilding and details are strong here, however you also gotta like the politics side of things.

1. Misspent Youth by Peter Hamilton. Took me a little while to get the point of this book, though I did enjoy it. I'm looking forward to exploring more of this universe. I really got the sense that this was a jumping off point for much bigger things, though I often found myself wanting the characters to get on with things. The politics in this book were fascinating, but the sex got a bit boring after a while - I guess hence the title.

2. Zoë's Tale by John Scalzi. I finished the Last Colony shortly before heading out for the trip, so I'd been saving this one for the trip. Damn Scalzi is awesome. This book was no exception. Scalzi's mix of humor and adventure was a perfect fit for a beach chair. This one had a bit more of a YA vibe to it which meshed well with the piña coladas. 

3. The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan. Again, YA + piña coladas = win. I'd read the Percy Jackson books last year on vacation so it was only fitting that I read the first of his Egyptian series this time round. This book was a fun ride, and I learned a lot about Egyptian mythology along the way. 

4-5. Software &amp; Wetware by Rudy Rucker. After the fluff, I felt like something a bit more substantial so I tackled the Ware Tetrology. I imagine that if Charlie Stross and Philip K. Dick had a love child then gave it ketamine he would write something like this. I'm still processing these, but I'm pretty sure I loved it. Now that I'm back I'm planning on diving into the rest of the series, then probably on to everything else he's written. I honestly don't know why it took me so long to get to Rucker. 

6. Android's Dream by John Scalzi. I saved this one till last because I wanted to end it on a high note. I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but I don't think it was this. Scalzi has become my favorite writer in a short period of time. If he writes a phone book, I will read it because it will the a phone book with heart, humor and excellent pacing.

So that's it. I don't even know if anyone will see this because its been a few days since the thread was active. My trip was definitely better because of the awesome recommendations in this thread - my post-trip reading list is also much longer - so I thought I should post a follow up in case anyone stumbled on this thread looking for the same thing.

I have been a long time away from SF, and I would like to make a return to it, enough high fantasy for me. I would like a recommendation for dark, almost gothic novels, preferably in space. 

I'm deeply fascinated with technology and what authors predict it will have in store for us, especially if it's explained in detail and can make you feel like it ""makes sense"". I love the idea of exploring a limitless universe, the mystery of new worlds and the incredible dangers they hold for mankind. I'm also not too turned off by aliens, so it's ok if they're part of the lore.

I'm thinking of something in the vein of Alien, Blindsight, Dune (at least the Harkonnen vision).

I recently went through surgery, and now I am able to enjoy the pleasure of reading books without straining my eyes, so I've decided to try and get into Sci-Fi.

For my first book I decided to pick up Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age since a lot of my friends had recommended this as ""required"" reading; I'm in about 50 pages in deep. A lot of the content I can understand, but I'm struggling with the vernacular expressed in the book. It's hard to sometimes visualize what is going on, and I sometimes feel lost. I'm glad the book switches contexts based on events, it does provide some relief when a certain portions are just too complex to read.

I'm not sure if I'm alone here, but does anyone know if there's perhaps a companion so that I don't get lost completely as I read through the book. Perhaps something that explains the vocabulary? Or perhaps, I chose the wrong book to begin with when venturing into sci-fi? I'm starting to regret this and wish I had started off with something simpler.

Edit: clarification

Edit 2: Thanks to everyone that has responded. I've found all comments insightful, and I think the message is to either stick it out (because it's a great book) or to find scifi with a more simple premise. I think I'll stick it out, and perhaps pick up another book in the meantime (I'm not too shabby at reading multiple books at a time).

My question is do you agree? I only read four of them myself, so I don't know if the Goodreads users got it right. Thanks!

I'm also interested in something like waterworld's post apocalyptic way of living in a world covered by the sea where nobody knows where the land is, something like The blue world by Jack Vance, I liked it very much.

2. If Raven was killed, do we assume the nuke was onboard the Raft and took them out?

They're all good reads, but you know the main character will escape danger and the story will wash out in the end...especially if it's written in first-person, right?  I'm looking for stories where the hero gets shot, the dragon eats the princess, the time bomb ticks down to 00:00, and the black-hat gets the girl.

&lt;edit&gt; These are great lists! Authors in the 60s and 70s definitely took the standard SF story to strange and unpredictable places.  It's no surprise most of the recommendations come from this period.",,False,,t5_2rzjk,1370620142.0,,,True,t3_1fqa35,http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1fqa35/rec_request_looking_for_a_book_with_a/,

If I skipped straight to The Prefect without reading Absolution Gap am I missing much? Or should I try and slog through it before starting the last book?
