So another mom approaches with her two sons.  I get my son away from the pony so they can enjoy.  As I'm still trying to get my son a penny she sends her boy over and he gives a penny to my son.

Thank you fellow mother.  Thank you for such a small act of kindness, for understanding what a pony ride means to a 2 year old.  Sometimes we mothers cut each other down and judge each other's parenting styles.  But moments like these I realize we are all in this together.

But just a bit ago I heard her fussing and went to help her before she woke herself to much. She just pushed the bottle away when I offered it and she wasn't wet but she put her arms up. So I picked her up and she streched her lettel arms and wrapped them around my neck and put her head on my shoulder and closed her eyes. I never thought I would ever have a ""that was all worth it"" moment but there it was right there. I still have a lot to deal with but it's like a weight has been lifted off me.

What you saw was a heavily pregnant lady holding a leash to seemingly the world's best behaved Labrador mix, followed by a lovely well behaved toddler who charmingly and literally blew kisses at everyone. We seemed calm, collected and happy. My ponytail hid the fact that I had baby food in my hair and the dog must have licked the last of it off my child's face because that too looked miraculously clean.

The reality was. We came to the dog park to escape the chaos at home. I can't sleep lately because I'm a whale about to pop. Add a dash of hormones. The toddler child threw at least five screaming fits that morning which somehow involved a food explosion (hence the ponytail). The dog got overly excited so I let her out... But the neighborhood cat was visiting so she went nuts barking and chasing it getting her paws all muddy before rushing into the house and jumping all over my couch. Did I mention my son was having a toddler day? Screaming, yelling, thrashing, tears, snot, spit, poop... everywhere all because his cheerios were on the floor... where he threw them. Also, I should mention that all this occurred before 8:00AM (my neighbors love me).

So. I found my happy place. Grabbed a granola bar. Cleaned the dog. Picked up my son still kicking and screaming and loaded the entire uncivilized bunch into the car. Somehow in the 10 minute hell-ride to the dog park, the transformation happened... You saw what you saw. I smiled graciously and thanked you.

Growing up as a girl I was always given dolls or water baby's to play with but constantly ditched them for Hot Wheels or a book. As a teenager I watched Mother's dealing with their children in a mall or at a restaurant and I pitied them, I pitied the sleep deprived look in their eyes or the overfilling diaper bags at their sides. Out of all of my eight siblings I was the one everybody believed would never have children, due to a lifelong dislike for them even when I was their ages. Then, unexpectedly, I did. 
During my pregnancy I became reluctantly attached to my growing bump and the little movements inside of myself. I knew, deep in my heart, I wanted her, loved her, before she was here, but I also was terrified of becoming one of those Mother's I used to pity. 
My mind was set that children were a handful I never wanted even after she was born. It didn't change through the hardships of having surgery to birth her, of breastfeeding around the clock, dealing with a newborn that hated sleep above all else (and she still does, 8 months later). I felt myself a horrible Mother, though I met her every need and loved her I still didn't feel in my heart I wanted children. Then, in one split second, as she turned 8 weeks old, I had an epiphany and it was born on the corners of her first smile. 
Everything I had ever felt about children or their parents before had disappeared, melted as her happy eyes lit up suddenly at the mere sight of me. I cried. I wept for I had never seen something so beautiful in the entirety of my existence. I still can't think of a sight that could match it. 
Now I understand why those sleepless nights are worth it, why totting around countless bags of accessories for your children is worth it, why giving up whatever life you had before your children is all worth it. Just one smile changed my world forever and I will never look back. Since then her laughter, smiles and seeing her grow has given me the greatest gift of all - a life to protect, to love and to comfort.

Tonight I went in to check on her, she woke up, looked at me and gave me the biggest sleepy smile. So I brought her out for a bottle and a change. After she was finished with her bottle she sat up and then crawled into my lap. She sat there all curled up in my lap for a half an hour just resting her head on my chest and her hands holding onto my arms but still awake. I couldn't help but get emotional. As clingy as she is lately she's still very mobile, it's always she wants to be near me but she never sits still. To have her just in my arms, just us together sitting and doing nothing but holding eachother completely quiet, that was amazing.

I was getting ready to put my little stinkerbell to bed and my brain started being a total jerk to me, just got a little neurotic and, much to my dismay, started crying a little in front of her. She noticed and said ""You crying? What's wrong, mommy?"" I said ""I'm just being weird, baby"". She wiped my tears and kept her hands on my cheeks and said ""I love you weird mommy"" and gave me a kiss. Anyone else would have spent hours talking to me trying to make me feel better. She made me feel like a worthwhile person again with only 5 words.

If I never succeed at anything else in my life, I just hope and pray to any gods who will listen that I am/will be a great mom to her. I know I'm fucking crazy, but I hope that in spite of that I can give back to her even half of what she has given me.

We went for my kids' physicals, we've had the same doctor from the beginning. 

Our doctor is so wonderful, supportive, smart, remembers everything.  Anyway, we were just talking and reflecting when the nurse came in to give my daughter her booster shots.

That's when it all came flooding back to me.  I remembered the first time I met my pediatrician was in the hospital room, I was so afraid of 'breaking the baby' and had been handling her like a delicate egg.  Then the doctor comes in and whips off her diaper, flips her over, pulls up her arms, pokes her belly... I remember my husband and I just watching in frozen horror at this woman manhandling our baby!!  But then the doctor sat down and simply talked to us, answering all our questions, offering reassurance--she is wonderful.

And I remembered my baby getting her first shots and how I felt like such a horrible person to betray that little thing by having her poked with needles.  Even though, I believed it was the right thing to do, it broke my heart.

And then I remembered the time when she was two and got her shots and she was so mad she threw the sucker back into the nurse's face.

Just all of these moments came back as my big girl sat on the examination table telling the doctor about her college plans and her hopes for the future. 

I know everyone says it, but it just goes so fast.  I was overwhelmed by the whole moment, seeing her there with the doctor who met her on her first day.  I just broke down. It wasn't sadness, exactly, I think it was awe at the whole experience.

I'm so excited for my daughter's future, I'm so thankful to have her in my life and hopefully I'm able to be a source support for her.  It's such an amazing journey to watch your little one grow and blossom.

So, Mommit, just enjoy every moment, enjoy every age with the joys and challenges that come with each one.  It's a marvelous gift we've been given to be able to nurture these little souls.

Anyway, thanks for letting me share!",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_ms5rv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/ms5rv/started_crying_at_the_pediatricians_office/,

It was unexpected and quite a surprise since I had the IUD that was supposed to be good for 10 years. I had it for 8 years. After discussing with my fiance we agreed and decided to remove the IUD knowing we had a 50% chance of having a miscarriage within 7 days after having it removed. It wasn't an easy decision but after our research, we found out if we kept the IUD in I would have a 50% chance of a miscarriage throughout my entire pregnancy. So in comparison from 9 months to 7 days...that was how we came to our decision. 
Following the 7 days after having the IUD removed were very stressful and nerve wrecking but worth it. At the end, I had no complications and my baby was good.
Well after multiple ultrasounds due to having the IUD my doc noticed an abnormality. I was sent to a specialist who confirmed that I had an ovarian mass the size of a softball. My mouth dropped in disbelief! I had just gone through getting the IUD successful removed and now an ovarian mass!! Next, I am told that I need to have it removed in order to avoid problems with my pregnancy and allow room for my baby to grow. So, I get scheduled to have surgery during my second trimester. More time to wait and stress... Now, during my entire pregnancy I dealt with the worst morning sickness both day and night. That alone was terrible and I was miserable. Finally, the day arrived for surgery. Long story short everything went well and we were all very thankful.
So after surgery had to have bed rest and recover. I continued to have terrible morning sickness and no matter what I would take it wouldn't help. 
Time went by and at 32 weeks found myself in the hospital because my water broke. I was an emotional rollercoaster, specially when doc went over possibilities of life threatening when having a premature baby. Long story short after being hospitalized for 7 days, I was sent home on strict bed rest because my water had sealed. WHAT! I never knew that was possible, but was trilled and happy that I was going home.
After going through so much during my entire pregnancy, I delivered my handsome lil babyboy on Christmas Day. He was a true gift! 

My experience and thought is that when things are meant to be, they are meant to be for a reason. I wouldn't never found out about my ovarian mass maybe until it was too late. Plus finally had my boy! 

Thankful to have a healthy babyboy!! My Christmas baby! ",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_19g9ut,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/19g9ut/iud_pregnant/,

1369019694.0,113,self.Mommit,1eo7v4,"Don't let her sleep in your bed, they said. She'll never sleep on her own, they said. They were wrong.",_Smashley_,135,22,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1eo7v4/dont_let_her_sleep_in_your_bed_they_said_shell/,"TL;DR: Clingy baby, coslept, successfully transitioned to her own bed and how we did it.

Everyone asks, ""How is she sleeping?""  I would mention we were cosleeping and get the typical ""Oh, no!"" or ""She'll never learn to sleep on her own!""  Typically, people would suggest sleep training/cry-it-out but I knew sleep training would not work for my child.  I felt that she needed me, for one reason or another, and I needed to be there for her.  I was constantly unsure about our breastfeeding relationship (misplaced fears, of course) and knew that if she was waking up wanting to nurse, she must need to eat.  Cosleeping made this so much easier.  We tried just about everything, but she just wouldn't sleep when laid down on her own.  Miracle blankets, white noise, vibration, swings, pacifiers: we tried it all.  Cosleeping worked for us.

Soon after her first birthday, I was beginning to realize that her nursing at night was no longer for nutrition.  She would wake up, signing furiously for milk all night long.  Once latched, she would comfort nurse for hours.  Unlatching caused hysterics until we started the whole cycle over again.  I was finally able to admit I was exhausted.  That was when I found [Dr. Jay Gordon's technique](http://drjaygordon.com/attachment/sleeppattern.html) on night weaning while cosleeping.  I wasn't very hopeful that my velcro baby would be receptive to this new, big change.  It worked.  It worked so freaking well.  Within a week she wasn't waking up anymore.  If she did, she would wimper, roll over, and be back to sleep.  This was a revolutionary change to the way our nights went for the previous year.  We knew the next step was transitioning out of our bed.

At 15 months, we put her mattress on our bedroom floor.  I would nurse her to sleep and lay her down, or lay down next to her and nurse her down there.  In the beginning, she woke up a few times a night and I would go lay with her (no nursing), hum, pat, and soothe her back to sleep.  One month later, she was sleeping straight through until 6am.  Then, I would bring her to my bed, nurse, and wake up at 7:30 for the day. 

Yesterday, we decided it was time to make the move.  I put her mattress back into her converted toddler bed and told her she was going to be sleeping in her own room now.  I nursed her down, just as before, put her in bed and guess what?  She slept in her own room, all night.  She woke up one time because she flopped out of the bed and landed on the very soft, carpeted floor. I went in, put her back in, and she was asleep.  Our typical nursing time rolled around, she woke up and we carried on like normal.  Tonight, we rolled up a blanket and slid it under the sheet so that it created a little barrier and she hopefully won't manage to roll out and wake up. 

I feel like the transition was slow and steady enough for her to be secure in each step before moving on to the next.  I don't regret cosleeping one bit.  I did what I had to do at the time to get rest and have a happy baby. Now, as I write this novel length post, I have a happy toddler sleeping soundly in her own bed at this very moment!  I'm hoping this will give some cosleeping moms who hear the ""they'll never sleep in their own bed"" some hope that they will!

She knocked my car off the road, totaling it. 
 
My perfect 1 year old little girl has been to hospitals, specialists, and was at one time thought to have a brain tumor because her eyes just started wandering. CT scans are heartbreaking, especially when they had to give her enough propofol to knock out an elephant.  

I couldn't pick up my babies for about a week because of my back and neck injuries. Could you even imagine not being able to hold your babies because of physical pain caused by someone's stupidity? My husband lost so many work hours, and I couldn't take pain pills because I had to take care of the kids when he finally did go back to work. It was agonizing when my back would spasm and shake from picking up my children. 

My daughter's eyes will never be the same from the trauma of taking the brunt of the impact. (her car hit my daughters door) The eye specialist said she will have to do vision therapy, glasses, and eye patches. All of that is hard to do with a 2 year old, and very expensive to the grand total of $635 for 2 pairs. 

This is just a rant as sometimes I wanna break down and cry still, but please, please, please....always pay attention while driving. Yes, no serious injuries happened, but it is heart wrenching to know my baby may need surgery to fix her eyes down the road.  She used to be so outgoing before the accident, now she refuses to potty train, (before she was going on the potty) her talking is very minimal, (about 10 words for a 25 month old) and she is afraid to go to new places. Any dr appointment is a break down.  

I just wanted to say that because of something as ridiculous as picking up a phone while driving,  my Eviee is no longer the same. 

Please pay attention to the road while driving. Everything else can wait......really.

Even my husband applauded you, once we were in private. 

Here you are, with 4 cute (and incredibly well-behaved) kids at check out, a cart full of food and a suddenly hungry baby. I knew what you were doing right away, turned to give you some privacy and then wanted to laugh out loud when my husbands eyes sudden go HUGE and he turned away for a few to give you the same curiosity. 

I offered to help with anything, considering you were balancing a hungry infant at your breast, but you worked your Awesome Mom magic and your little helpers went to work. 

Seriously though, I was always too nervous to bf in public. My daughter didn't like being covered by anything, so even when we had company I would have to leave the room for up to an hour to take care of her. It wasn't so much a thing about letting people know I was breast feeding more as I have large breasts and it made me feel uncomfortable to be all-out without some sort of shield against eyes. I wanted to hug you and cheer you on, right there in the check out aisle at the grocery store. A little over-the-top, I know. I'm pretty sure the cashier was proud too. She watched you walk away beaming!!!

He is the source of so much joy, pride, happiness, and laughter for my husband and I.  We have been together for 10 years and married for 1.5 years.  We always knew we would be this family one day, but took our time growing up and maturing until we were exactly where we wanted to be in order to give our future children everything that we wanted them to have.  I regret nothing about the path we have chosen... except that I regret everything.  The time we took to become who we are now was crucial.  This is exactly the way my life was always supposed to be.  My husband is my best friend, and after spending 1/3 of my life with him, I couldn't imagine it any other way.  

My mom passed away two weeks ago.  She was 61 years old and died of melanoma.  Ten years ago she had melanoma skin cancer removed.  Three years ago she had part of her lung removed due to a melanoma tumor.  At that time she and my dad realized what was coming.  Last August the melanoma showed back up as tumors in her abdomen.  She tried several grueling and tortuous treatments, some that a lot of patients don't even live through.  She fought on fearlessly and never complained.  I was pregnant at the time and the info shared with me was ""edited"" to say the least.  They were protecting their first grandbaby by keeping me calm and healthy.  My mom answered every crazy pregnant phone call, calmed me down continuously, cheered me on as I ran until 8 months and weight lifted until after my due date, and supported me in every way a daughter could ask her mother to support her pregnancy.  She was just out of the hospital in between treatments when she came to my baby shower which she helped plan.

My son was born on January 1 and my parents came to the hospital in tuxedos with champagne!  According to my dad, ""how else are you supposed to greet a New Year's baby?""  They were head over heels for Wesley.  He was everything and more that we were waiting for. 

While I was home on maternity leave, my mom was hospitalized again.  This time she was there for a few weeks and I took Wesley to see his Nannie every afternoon.  We sat and talked, cried, and giggled.  I knew she was sick, but I didn't realize how serious the situation was at the time.  She was so calm and resolved that it just never occurred to me that we were running out of time.  Wesley was 3 1/2 months old when she passed.  They didn't get a lot of time together but they had quality time.  She took us to his first pediatrician's appointment, he had his first belly laugh in her lap, and he smiled that big silly baby smile whenever he saw her.

Two weeks ago we went to Florida for a family vacation, some quality time while we still could.  My parents arrived on Saturday and Wesley and I flew in on Sunday.  All Sunday afternoon and evening we sat with her while I read to Wesley and we played.  Her mind was coming and going and she was struggling to breathe.  It took all she had to get a few words out when we would ask if she was in pain or needed anything.  But, she looked over at my little guy and smiled.  Hours later she took her last breath as my dad held her.  The last thing I said to her was when Wesley and I gave her goodnight kisses and I told her that we loved her.  My brother arrived the next morning and we spent the day together trying to make sense of what to do next.  We remained in Florida for a few days.  It probably seems crazy to others that we would stay there ""on vacation"" but the closeness and isolation there was invaluable.  We needed time to make sure we and each other were going to be ok.  For those few days, Wesley was the shining light that kept us going.  He would laugh and play and we spent all of our time cuddling him.

I started this post by saying that I don't regret the path my life has taken, and I don't.  But I can't help but feel guilty that I took so much time being a self centered college student and then working my way up getting my career going.  I could have gotten him here years ago and they would have had time together,  but I didn't.  It cost my mom the experience of being a grandmother and it cost my son the opportunity to know a truly amazing lady.  When I grieve I can't even grieve for my loss.  I look at Wesley and it kills me to think what he is missing.  Then I grieve the new relationship that I was just starting with my mom.  One where we are both mothers.

So, I will struggle like every new mom does and I will learn my lessons the hard way like we all do.  And at the end of the day I will quietly think about the lady who would have taken my phone call and listened while I complained about day care or night time feedings or whatever trivial thing I was worried about.  Then I will turn my attitude around be the kind of mom that she was, because I know first hand how amazing it is to be raised by a mom like that.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_1dfis0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1dfis0/becoming_a_mom_without_my_mom/,

I held her small face in my hands, looked into her eyes, and whispered to her that she was truly beautiful. She looked back into my eyes and solemnly whispered back: ""I know"". 

Of course my first reaction was to smile and laugh and think how adorable she was, but then later I got to thinking about that moment. When I was growing up, compliments in my household were something to be denied and rebuffed. ""No I'm not, don't be silly."" ""You're just saying that to be kind."" and so on. My mother was never able to recognize her own beauty, to herself or to others. Of course she would tell me that I was beautiful growing up, but I never truly believed her; she was just being kind. In truth, I was a fat kid, and given how hard she was on herself for her perceived weight issues, I couldn't see how she could possibly think that I was beautiful. Compliments were given to be nice, not to be sincere.

Even after I got myself physically healthy and turned into a strong, capable and beautiful young woman, I thought I was a fake. It took me a long time to recognize my own strengths, and even longer to accept that others recognized them too. When I had my own daughters, I swore that I would not berate myself in front of them. I was determined to show them that I was proud of myself, my body, my accomplishments (which include having them). I don't want my daughters to learn fake modesty through belittling themselves. I want them to learn true modesty through an understanding of themselves, and through empathy for others.

So when my small daughter looked at me and earnestly told me she knew she was beautiful, that's a big moment for me and a reflection that I am proud of!",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,lightcoral,True,t3_1hdg3w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1hdg3w/proud_mamma_revelation_moment/,

While snuggling and playing with my nearly 3 month old daughter tonight, she gave me one of life's greatest gifts...

She vomited on me.  Not just anywhere, but on my cheek.  That curdled cheese milk vomit only produced by breastfed babies.  I sat there in shock as it dripped down my chin and then my neck and when I finally came to my senses I pulled my shirt off and wiped my face with it.  Then I sat my daughter on my lap to face me and tell her how utterly disgusting she was, only she wasn't looking at *me*, but staring down at my tits.

1369104494.0,88,self.Mommit,1eqnda,I'm embarrassed to talk about this to anyone I know. SAHM feeling very disempowered in my marriage.,SAHMsad,99,11,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1eqnda/im_embarrassed_to_talk_about_this_to_anyone_i/,"I'm a stay-at-home mom to an 8 month old baby. My husband works full time. Lately I have been feeling so disempowered about our finances, but I feel so embarrassed to talk about this problem to my family. 

We have been together about 5 years, were engaged for 1 year when I got pregnant. We had a small marriage ceremony when I was a couple months pregnant. We discussed our finances and things have always been ""whatever I have is ours"" but we never had a joint account and I never felt a strong need to have one because I have always had my own income. 

We discussed and decided I would stay home with the baby. The numbers worked. But my husband never added me onto his bank account. OK, no big deal I thought. I still had some money in the bank, it did not seem pressing. We eventually got to the point where my husband had to take over all our bills because I ran out of money. 

It turns out my husband has been lying to me about how much money he makes (WTF?). I came to discover this after a lengthy argument/discussion about our finances. (The reason: He seemed to run out of money really fast and my one credit card which he agreed to pay was past due. I have never been late on payments.) He says he lied because thought I would think less of him. 

I said we had issues about financial transparency and that I needed to be added onto his bank account. He said he would NOT add me. At this point I'm thinking oh god I've screwed myself, I'm one of those women financially abused by her husband. He says he pays for everything (this is true, barring that late bill) and that I don't need to be on it. He says he will add me in a few months. That makes me think he's ashamed of something about his finances OR I guess he could be hiding something worse. 

There is other stuff. I gave my husband $500 in cash in the first few weeks after we had the baby to send a payment to the hospital and he never made it. I should have sent it myself but I had cash and I was so tired back then, why not trust your husband? I got a letter about it being past due and husband says ""that a mistake"" then that ""he took care of it."" Then I get another letter. Then I find out he asked his mother for $1000 ""to pay the hospital expenses for the baby."" Our portion due was only $500 and I paid it. This made me especially upset because I don't want anyone to pay for our baby's delivery expenses besides us as the parents. 

He asks his mother for money without discussing it with me. She is a wealthy old lady and it may not be a big deal to her but it matters to me. I told him I disagreed with him asking her for money because there should be no need - in theory, he makes enough to cover our expenses with a bit left over. He says that it's not really my business if he asks his mom for something because it's his mom. 

Today, husband asks me, ""Isn't XYZ visiting us tomorrow? Get a bottle of wine."" I said I can't afford to get wine. He says ""If you want to buy wine you should ask me for the money."" I get so mad! I say ""I shouldn't have to ask you for money, if you don't split any money with me I am assuming there is none to divide."" He says I'm overreacting and that ""it's our money"" but I have no access to it! I have no way of knowing what he actually has there. I dont want to ask my husband for $20 here and there. That is not a marriage. 

I have $25 in my bank account right now. I feel so low. I used to be independent. I'm so stupid for not having set up our finances before getting married. I may have not left my job foolishly thinking my husband would take of us. I may have never decided to have a baby with this man in the first place. 

I'm working on becoming employed again and I also have to figure out child care, which adds another layer of sadness to this whole situation because I know I will miss my baby. I'm not sure I will get over this even if I get a job though? He says I don't need to work right now and to just take care of the baby and that I can work when she's older. I don't think that will work for me. But I do kinda feel guilty that I want to work and will have to leave my baby - for money? Or is it more about financial freedom? Is that more important than being home with her? He does pay our bills. I just have zero money and zero access to his accounts. What do I do?

I'm open to insight or advice. Thanks mommit. ",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_1eqnda,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1eqnda/im_embarrassed_to_talk_about_this_to_anyone_i/,

Lately, it's been getting harder and harder to get my Son back when I want him.
starting Oct. 23 I've been trying to get in contact with His father but he hasn't answered my texts, calls or voice mails about me picking up my Son and nor does his girlfriend. Their mother-in-law hasn't heard from them in days either. I've texted and called everyone for six days straight to no avail. I literally do not know the whereabouts of my Son or his father. I have their address which is an hour away from me and when I go and show up, nobody is home. I call from different phones but no answer. I'm terrified that something has happened and I'm upset because I feel as though I'm just overreacting. Is there some legal action I can take, or something I can do? I'm just stuck.

~~UPDATE~~

~~I called the police and they said because i willingly gave them to him for visitation and didn't set a return date, so apparently there is nothing they can do. It was APD though and I'm in Fulton county. Should I contact the county that my ex lives in?~~

~~Update~~

~~I called his Mom yesterday and pretty much lied to her saying if he didn't contact me within 24 hours, the police will put out a warrant for him on kidnapping.~~
~~She started repeating what I was saying as if letting someone else in the room know what was going on.~~
~~She called a bit ago saying how she is going to their house within the hour to get him to call me so I can ""call off the charge"" because they don't have the money to get him out.~~
~~I'm waiting on the call and if it doesn't come, I'll call the police to at least do the welfare check you guys tipped me on.
I really do appreciate the help everyone.~~

He apologized profusely and told me ""he had no idea what it entailed"" and ""I had no idea you have been doing all of this alone"" He had me pick him up immediately in the am (8am) instead of the evening. He said he would be open to coming up and learning his routine now and that he is sorry he didn't trust me. He said he was ""so determined to prove that he could do it but he ended up proving he couldn't""

Him and I had a long talk when I picked him up. We are going to go to counseling together to work out our parenting issues- as someone in the original post suggested.

I also wanted to point out something to everyone who reemed me out in my original post:

I never kept my son from him nor do I want to. I wanted to keep my son SAFE. The fact that he had to call 8 times in 12 hours screams that he was ill prepared. He WILL be getting him his next scheduled visit and he has agreed to come up and learn how to care for him before that visit (as he should have before this one). I absolutely do not feel bad about wanting him to stay home when he was sick and the fact that his dad had no idea how to care for him. I know for sure I am in the right. You need to check yourself if you think I am a bad parent for being concerned about my son's well being. Why aren't I one of those mothers who doesn't give a shit and drops her kid off for the weekend whenever she can?

nonetheless, I am very appreciative of all the encouraging comments I received. I am so relieved that he has a new understanding of what I do- and realizes that he has a lot to learn and is open to learning it.

plus the HUGE smile coming from my boy when I came to get him warmed my heart like nothing else :)",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,green,True,t3_1ai31i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1ai31i/update_on_atticus_and_his_daddy/,

1345485708.0,83,self.Mommit,yj8ay,My son (2.5) is in the process of being diagnosed with Autism. I am falling to pieces. ,dieflamingoes,106,23,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/yj8ay/my_son_25_is_in_the_process_of_being_diagnosed/,"Utterly and completely devastated. I guess that's normal for mothers in this situation - I mean, everyone wishes their children were perfect. I don't know. I've been at the forefront of having him tested and diagnosed, ever since he was a baby I've always known there was something different about him. He never cried, which may seem like a blessing to other mothers - but he never cried. Even when he was hungry. He lost so much weight when I brought him home - because I didn't know when to feed him, he wouldn't tell me. He wouldn't make a peep to save his own life. I had to set my alarm clocks to go off every three hours, so that he wouldn't starve. I knew that was wrong. I knew that babies were supposed to cry. I was always afraid to compare him to other kids his age, because I knew what I'd see. I knew that he'd be so different - and that I'd have to figure out why, and what if... what if it's my fault some how.

I spent the last year and a half trying to convince the people around me, including my sons doctors, that he needed to be tested. Everyone gave me the ""wait and see"" routine. Finally, after screaming at them a lot - people started to look at me and say ""Why are you trying to hard to prove that there's something wrong with your child?"" - like my demanding his testing would be the last nail in his coffin, or something. No one understands that I am just trying to do what I feel is right by my child. Still, can't they tell that it's eating me up inside?

I was a very advanced child - intellectually. By my sons age, I could write my name and speak full sentences. I knew the alphabet. I could recite poems. I didn't have any social skills because I preferred story books over people - but I was content with my solitude anyways. My brain got my through life, all throughout elementary school and middle school - having an imagination I could escape too is what saved me. Now they tell me that my son may never have that. He has never played make believe. He has no interest in imagination. He hates other children. He only likes non-fiction story books. He detests toys unless they are cars, and even than he never plays with them... he lines them up categorized by shape, color and the size of the wheels. Every wonderful childhood memory I have, that I had hoped to share with my child - has been dashed. He and I will never pretend to be pirates searching for buried gold in the back yard. He will never much care for bedtime stories such as Harry Potter or The Hobbit. We won't play dress-up. He's a year behind developmentally; he may never even reach average intelligence (by it's general definition).

Of course I am sad. Of course I don't WANT this for my child. Who would? No one would choose this. Everything that brings me joy in life - he can't relate to. My son will never relate to me, he will never find joy in the things I try and share with him. Still, I have to wake up every day and go to work and drop him off with the sitter and spend my lunch break on the phone arguing with doctors and reading books and articles on Autism and fighting tooth and nail to give my son the diagnosis that might eventually get him the help he needs.... and trying to hold myself together in the process. Than the cooking, for the little boy who wont eat 90% of the food in existence. Every day it's a challenge to find out if he'll eat or choose to starve. Than the cleaning, fighting against a child with OCD-like tendencies who must have the house a certain way, cars lines up in corners and toys in piles that can't be moved or cleaned because than a tantrum is surely coming. Never going out into the world because he hates play dates, he hates family gatherings, he hates fairs and festivals and fun family events - not just hate, no - but he shuts off. The smallest bit of sensory overload and he stops blinking, stops talking, stops moving - he dead weights himself. Like he's gone comatose. So, no weddings now. No funerals. No family BBQ's. No Easter and the Barn. No festival of lights. Nothing public. Nothing loud. No fireworks. I keep having to tell my friends and families ""Sorry, we can't come"" and them not understanding. ""Why not?"" they ask ""Danny won't like it?"" we plead, ""So - he's a toddler. Make him come, he'll like it once he's here"". Because they don't understand, they can't understand. It's not easy. 

None of this is easy. Pretending like everything is okay and being the super-mom, strong and powerful - advocating for my son.... when all I really want to do is sit down and cry, because it's hard. It's hard being my son's mother. It's hard knowing that he doesn't want hugs or kisses - he probably won't, ever. He doesn't want to show me affection, I don't even know if he cares for me, locked away up there in his head like he is. It's hard knowing that all the things I imagined us bonding over are impossible. It's hard watching him get so frustrated and angry because he want's to talk to me - he wants to communicate his needs and feelings - but he literally can not; he gets mad and he pinches me and I have to send him for a time-out when it's not really his fault. He's just reacting to the situation his disability has put him in. It's hard. It's all so hard.

Still, I have to be strong for him because if I don't - no one else will be. If I am not strong, he won't get the help he needs... and he may get stuck forever in this mind that can't properly communicate his thoughts, feelings and needs to the world. I am not allowed to be weak. I am not allowed to be sad. Hell, I am barely allowed to sleep anymore - but god am I tired. And I know, I know I just ranted and raved for paragraphs upon paragraphs and that I didn't pose a question that anyone out there in mommit could truly answer for me - but I needed to do it. I needed to finally tell someone that I am not okay. I needed to be weak, for a moment, because as soon as I am done typing this I have to get right back on the phone and start fighting again... and I'll be fighting from now until the conceivable future - as a mother, what else is there to do?

Edit: Thank You to everyone, for the kind words. It is much appreciated. I turned to the internet for support from other mothers - and I found it. Now that I've been able to voice these thoughts here, I am hoping to turn to my immediate support system as well as (hopefully) finding a support group for parents of autistic children. This momentary lapse into stress and frustration has given me the strength to keep fighting for my son and his needs, and I will be speaking openly and honestly to the few family members who have (up to this point) been acting in an accusatory and unhelpful manor. Hopefully once my son and I have started the early intervention work, I can come back to you with an update on how we are both doing - with good news. Thank you, again - for the support, it's more than I could have thought to ask for. 

**Edit Two**: Wow, wow wow wow wow. Thank you everyone! I've gotten more tips and hints than I ever thought possible; and I feel great now. I feel ready. I finally actually have an action plan of what I am going to do, to help my son - other than just yell at whichever doctors will listen. I am going to be making booklets of pictures to aid him in communication, we are going to make personalized social stories to help him with day to day social living stuff, we are saving up for an ipad and looking into all the different apps available for him. We are going to start concentrating on the things he does like; science, machinery, cars, trains, animals - and stop trying to push the things he dislikes. Encourage who he is; and make no attempts to define who he should be - he'll make that definition himself, when he's ready. We are going to be giving our house a little overhaul to check for any sensory things that might have been throwing him off - that we hadn't noticed. My spouse and I will be looking for a support group for autistic parents, and I will be educating my family and friends that had previously been acting in a way that was detrimental to my son's development. I am really looking forward to finally having a plan - and making some progress. I can't wait to communicate with my son; it'll make these last two and a half years of hard work, all worth it.

I can't tell you how proud I am of them. Hard workers, good in school, and despite the fact that they have each had their horrible challenges and stunningly reckless behavior... they have all survived to adulthood. 

I could say something about how proud I am about them in school, but it's not really the thing that makes me the proudest about them. Sure they are all really intelligent but all I had to do with that was some lucky genes. Sure they have great senses of humor, but I raised them on Monty Python. 

I am proud of the men that they are. I am proud that they follow through. I am proud that despite the practice that they had as children with lying, they are honest and straightforward. I am proud that they have tender, loving hearts. I am proud that they treat their girlfriends with love and respect, unlike many of their peers. I am proud that they are mentally stable and respect the boundaries of others. I am proud that they take the risks and live their lives without a net. That they love dogs and cats and children. 

I am proud that somehow, in spite of the fact that I myself am such a fucked up mess from a bad home, I managed to transcend bad marriages and muscle myself to not do what to them the horrible things that had been done to me as a kid. I am proud that they are happy with life and what they are doing to meet their adult goals. And that I did this for the most part, on my own as a divorced mom. Somehow, some way, I managed to not fuck them up. I have no idea how that happened.

So when days get discouraging with your young ones and you feel like you are squeezed out and frustrated, unable to take one more setback. When potty training isn't going well, or they bite another kid at the day care I want you to think about what I am telling you now. 

Eventually your children will grow up and become productive adults that will mirror every instant of the hard work and love that you put into them. You will see your kid pick up someone's baby and give it a loving hug. You will see them lean over and be kind to a pet. You will see them walk for their graduation. You will be in awe of the process of change and growth as they morph from wide eyed innocence into adults that you will impress you.

Well, son, you did it. You are 1 year old now. I'm not sure why you felt the need to grow up so fast. Are you happy, baby? Do you remember 8:12am last year? You were so small, but so strong. I was so happy. Do you remember how you screamed like I was torturing you when you took your first bath? Do you remember when you were 2 weeks old and I thought you had a skin disease, and Papaw explained to me that it was just diaper rash? Do you remember having to have the hair dryer going while I rocked you just to get you to sleep? Do you remember when you were a month old and no longer wanted to sleep in my bed? Do you remember when you were 2 months old and I tried to convince everyone that you were definitely saying ""mama"" when you cried? They called me crazy, but I know you were. And that night your first swing stopped swinging and Mommy had to panic all night trying to figure out how to get you to sleep? You fell asleep snuggling eeyore in your pooh bear bouncer. I cried for 15 minutes from sheer relief. Do you remember Halloween when I was trying to get you to sleep, but those asshole children were beating on the windows demanding candy? I almost kicked a child that night, baby. Do you remember Thanksgiving when Mommy tried to make dinner for everyone by herself? It turned out awesome, don't you forget that. Do you remember my birthday? When I left you for the first time with Gramma for a few hours? I didn't even have fun because I missed you. Do you remember my confusion on Christmas about what to get a baby that has everything, and doesn't pay attention to any of it? Do you remember when we moved out of the apartment? You were so mad that we were taking all of your things out of the house. I put your swing in my room for the first few weeks in the new house because I couldn't imagine not having you right next to me. Do you remember when you sat up on your own for the first time? I took a picture then pushed you down. I wasn't going to tolerate you growing up. Do you remember your first bites of food? Uncle Brad said it looked like poop and by the look on your face after that first bite, you agreed. Do you remember when you stood up in your bed for the first time? You got your foot stuck in the corner, and oh how you screamed. Mommy laughed. Mean mommy. Do you remember your phase of rocking back in forth trying to crawl? And when just all of a sudden when we were leaving Grammas house and you decided to take off crawling? Do you remember all of your trips to Barnes and Noble with Gramma? Do you remember when mommy was ignoring you because she had to get ready and you cried and said ""Mama"" for the first time? That got my attention, didn't it? Do you remember the drive we took to Alabama? And having to stop at that shady rest stop for 2 hours because you were done riding in the car? Do you remember the first time you choked? On the hershey kiss wrappers? In my car? Do you remember how I cried? Oh, I cried. Do you remember Papaw teaching you how to drink out of a bottle? Do you remember having your first bad fever? for a week? My fear? Do you remember the drive back home? Stopping at that hotel and me letting you crawl around the filthy floor with reckless abandon because it made you so happy? Do you remember going swimming for the first time? It was so cold. Do you remember when you found that pokemon card and just HAD to show me, so you walked? Do you remember me crying because I was so happy those precious first steps didn't happen at daycare? Baby boy, you have given me the happiest year of my life. I remember every single second of your amazing little life, I hope in the future I can give you some memories that are even half as precious as the ones you have given me. I know you had to drag me kicking and screaming to this day, and I can't promise that I won't be sad every single year on this day. Every day you get more independent, every day you grow further and further away from that little boy that needs my snuggles. I can promise you this though, I got your love and kisses from day one, and whether you're 15 or 50, I will always force you to give me kisses and snuggles. Thems the breaks, love. I can't believe it has been a year. You are the most amazing thing I could have ever dreamed of, and I'm excited to have more years like this one. Happy birthday, tiger. You're my whole world, baby. 
Xoxoxo, I love you more than you will ever know.

I got pregnant when I was 21, married when I was about three months pregnant. Dropped out of college, since my husband was still in school and we had to make rent somehow. I have been a stay-at-home mom since my son was born. 

I rationalized this choice because I thought that it was a better choice for my child. Daycares where we have lived - a lot of different places - have consistently been either *way* too expensive ($1600 a month for 3 days a week!) or of such poor quality that it scared me - mothers would complain about their children being underfed or not fed at all, exhausted to the point of delirium or hysterically upset when they picked them up. I thought okay, we can afford for me to stay home, I'll stay home and make sure I'm the best mom I can be to my angel. 

But my son is a nightmare. He bites, throws, kicks, punches. He swears. He tells me he hates me. He *will not* sit still, even to eat, unless he is actively engaged in pooping. He refuses to use the potty - to the point where he'll hold it so long it requires medical intervention. Television helps but he still only sits still for five or ten minutes before he's up and running again. He's three years old. 

He starts preschool in the fall and I'm terrified of what the teacher will think. He screams for no reason. He shrieks, chases our cats with any object he can get is hands on, and I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do. I have tried everything. I've read the books, I've followed the methods, I've tried adjusting every aspect of our routine to help him. I hate those mothers who say that their toddlers have ADHD but I seriously think he might. Sometimes when he talks about something he gets excited and his arms and legs flail and twitch like he can barely hold them still. 

Last night as we were getting out of the tub, I was carrying him all wrapped up in a towel and he leaned over and bit my neck so hard I screamed. He laughed and said ""I hate you I hate you."" Through tears, I told my husband what happened and he took over and spoke very  harshly to our son about what he had done as I went to my room to cry.

I can't handle this anymore. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I feel like the worst mother in the world and I have nowhere else to go. 

If any of you have any suggestions, please, please tell me. 




**EDIT**: I just wanted to thank everyone for the wonderful responses. The outpouring of help and advice and sympathy has been incredible for me. I've decided - with the advice of everyone here, and talking with my husband - that we're going to try one more time just on our own. We lose patience with him quite easily (he makes it tough to stay patient!) but a giant parenting overhaul - plus more structure for him here at home - may be the change he needs. 

I think I'm noticing a difference already, just trying it yesterday afternoon. 

However - he's starting a swimming class in two weeks, and preschool in September. I'll be keeping an eye on his behavior in those places, and the next time we go to the pediatrician, I will be asking her for her recommendation in regards to testing. 

Thanks again to everyone who replied. I was losing it and you guys helped me find it. I hope there's no disorder here, but thanks for making me feel less scared. ",,False,,t5_2s3i3,1372850671.0,,,True,t3_1hhyd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1hhyd4/im_failing_and_i_need_help/,

This is the third such breakdown I've had during this pregnancy. I can't handle basic life anymore, much less the addition of a newborn in approximately two weeks. I love my toddler, I guess, but when I hear things like, ""my child has brought so much joy to my life"" I'm absolutely mystified. That thread a few days back about not wanting to hear people say ""your life is over once the baby comes""?  Well in my case it's been totally true. I have no life outside of fighting with my child to nap and cleaning up the food he throws across the room. And now we're going to have another one?  What the fuck was I thinking????  I have zero excitement about this coming child. I'm mainly excited to not be pregnant anymore. I find myself wishing more and more that I'll just die in childbirth. Not really looking for advice or anything, but there's no other place where I can say these things. 

I do have a long ugly history of depression and I have been seeking out treatment. The earliest appointment I could get was a month from now. I even went to the emergency psych ward this morning and what I got was... A referral to call the place where I can't get an appointment for a month. The OB who oversees the midwife practice I go to isn't comfortable writing me a prescription for antidepressants.

So yeah, I'm one of those people who should never have had kids and will most likely be horrifically miserable the rest of my life. It sucks, but there's no ""do-over"".

In Texas, if your kid has a fever of 100.3, they get sent home. So, on Tuesday, Lily wakes up with a 102 fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough. Not necessarily anything to flip out and go to the ER about, we've done it before. But it does mean that someone is going to have to stay home with the little booger! I make less money, and I have a few sick days, so I call in. Boss sounds a little iffy on the phone, and tries to convince me to come in, but I am adamant. I call the doctor immediately after the boss- doc says, sounds like a cold, aggravated by teething (8 months, still not even a little bit of teeth!!!), call if her fever gets over 103. Otherwise, she should be ok to go back to daycare tomorrow. 

Her fever breaks around 1 pmish. Nothing big. She is fever free the next day, I send her to daycare.

Boss doesn't really say much, work is normal.

Fast forward to today. I apparently am not dedicating myself to my job, and my boss thinks that I probably exaggerated Lily's fever to get to stay home. I need to put my priority on my career!

Cue jaw drop.

My boss is a nice lady, a mother whom I respect. Normally she is kind and understanding... so I'm at a loss as to where this came from. I spent the rest of the day busting my ass trying to prove that I am an asset to the company, etc etc, because if I lost this job... we are *screwed*.

I'm not really here for advice... just venting. I hate America and the work ethic, the absolute negativity on calling in sick, the implied laziness that I have developed because I am a working mother. Sure, I'd rather be at home taking care of/raising my own damn child, but I can't afford to.

He presented a fever (highest 103.5) but was otherwise his happy self. Pediatrician said it was just a virus, no big deal. Then he broke out in a head to toe rash- ugly looking thing that we thought might be a food allergy. Turns out a bunch of kids in daycare had the same rash along with the virus so nothing to worry about, just let it run it's course.

Skip to yesterday morning. I start off with a mild headache in the morning that progressively gets more severe. After 3 doses of Advil and nothing but agony, I get to the ER. Ct scan, blood tests, all fine. Agreed to a lumbar puncture, and thank god I did- it showed I have meningitis! And it's likely morphed from the virus my son had the last few days.

So I'm here in the hospital for the next few days at least. They're pretty sure we're looking at viral, not bacterial, meningitis. But boy, how scary and painful! I'm on antibiotics, antivirals, painkillers. They're basically nuking this thing from orbit.

The baby seems fine and is being looked after by his dad and my best friend. We will keep a close eye on him in the next few days.

A woman in the store stopped me and said ""I really hope that's not soda you're giving to your baby! That would explain why he's complaining so much.""

I had a flash of anger, because if I have to listen to such nonsense from relatives with a tooth-gritting smile on my face, I sure as hell don't need to hear it from a perfect stranger.

""No,"" I responded in as frostly a tone as I could muster, ""It's prune juice, the poor kid hasn't pooped in 2 days. But stick around, I'm sure I'll do *something* you'll feel the need to judge me for- you know, being a perfect stranger and all. Because I really need to know your opinions on my parenting abilities. Mind your own damned business, lady.""

It really felt good to say it, and it's probably a speech I should have on hand whenever anyone questions my choices and makes a stupid, and unwanted, comment about my child. But honestly, what is with people who think they have the right to judge us or get a vote in the raising of our families?

It sounds silly but salt cars are an old tradition in my family.  I used to do it with my son when he was two and I haven't set it up in at least a year.  He's four and I just put together salt cars for him and he was so happy and has been playing for ages.

We have a two and a half year old girl and a five month old boy.  My son was being a typical baby and exploring his vocal cords.  He was standing on my lap bouncing and telling a very loud story to the couple behind us while sucking on his fingers and pulling my hair.  Now this couple was very old, and had a five month old great granddaughter, so they took to my son right away.  The woman was very sweet and the kind of grandmother that everyone would love to have.  As the night went on my little guy got tired and his story became more of laugh-cry-laugh-cry as his good mood was losing the battle with his desire for sleep.  When we were leaving I said goodbye to the couple and thanked them for their kindness and patience.  A crying baby doesn't stress me out in the least, but I felt bad that he was doing it right in this woman's ear.  She responded back with words that hit me hard and are sticking with me, ""Oh, just thank God he can cry."" It's so true. 

Again, the crying doesn't bother me, but the daily struggle of getting my 2 1/2 year old daughter to nap is my least favorite part of my day! I took this stranger's words and have applied it to my daughter. ""Thank God, every minute of every day, that my daughter is so healthy that she doesn't need a nap and can play all day long. Thank God."" 

Now I'm not saying that I'm happy about her not napping, and she takes a very long quiet rest every day, but there are so many parents that would give up anything for their child to get of bed and play, or for their baby to cry. I'm not saying something cheesy like ""enjoy every minute"" of raising children, but that great grandmother's outlook really struck me and gave me something to think about. Also, since giving up the nap battle, my DD goes to bed at 7:30 every night easy as pie and my husband and I get to start our evening alone just a little bit earlier.

My husband has never helped me with our baby (5 mos). At first I let it slide because I was exclusively breastfeeding and on maternity leave but it's just gotten ridiculous.

He literally won't do ANYTHING. Never mind the big stuff, like getting up at night, bath time, etc., but he also won't change diapers, drop her off at daycare, hold her so I can eat dinner/breakfast. If we're out somewhere and she starts crying I am ALWAYS the one who goes outside to calm her. 

He's also wildly inconsiderate. I work long hours and my job requires me to be outside all day so I come home from work absolutely exhausted and hungry and he'll just hand her to me. Usually he 'needs' to go seine where too, so I don't even have time to change out of my work clothes.

All of this is REALLY starting to get to me, and the kicker is that he acts this way and then gets all confused when I have a short temper with him or when I'm too tired to be intimate. I've tried to talk to him about his behavior and he promised me he would change but so far I've seen zero improvement.

It seems never ending. Any other Moms feel bogged down by guilt? And if not- how did you work past it?

Edit: A lot of you have mentioned that society and the Moms who seem to ""have it all together"" have put this pressure on me. But honestly I really think it is self-imposed. I don't compare myself to other Moms really...I just really want to do a great job. I think most of my guilt comes from not really liking being a stay-at-home Mom. I feel guilty that I don't like it because so many Moms wish they could be home raising their kids (or think they do at least) but can't because of financial reasons.

I have never in my life heard someone tell a mother or father that they don't let their baby cry enough. When my MIL is visiting she actually refrains from giving me the baby when I ask when she is crying because she thinks she needs to cry more.

A 2 week old does not know what manipulating is. She cries when she is uncomfortable, hot/cold, hungry, or wants some loving. She isn't at the age where she will cry purely for attention. I, and my SO, don't see anything wrong with comforting our newborn when she is crying. 

Trouble is, his mother is very stubborn and has issues listening. Things we tell her seem to go in one ear and out the other. I'm not sure what else to say to make her back off with her opinions.

I have a bad genetic health condition that makes me quite frail, and in mid December, I threw out my back badly. First my husband took off time to help, then my mom came up for a week, and then his mom, who's retired, came up for over a month, all to help with my son, and give me time to recover.

That was... difficult, to say the least, but I at least expected my son to be safe. She's insanely paranoid about everything - you know the type. Always bundled up, even if he's sweating, freaking out if he so much as touches a power cord. Drove me nuts, but I trusted her.

And...

I've been giving my son this liquid yogurt stuff in a sippy cup for some time now. But, I learned an age ago, it's damned hard to clean if it goes even a day without cleaning. So I had a system. I had 1 designated sippy cup for yogurt, cleaned immediately after use, 1 sippy cup for juice, a little less stringently cleaned, and the rest were water only. If the juice or yogurt sippy cups couldn't be found, he just didn't get any.

When my back went out, I warned each of them, in order (hubby, mom, MIL), about the yogurt, about how hard the sippy cups are to clean, and how important it is to take the valve out *every time* in order to clean them. They all agreed like I was talking about the obvious, so I was satisfied.

I've not been able to clean the cups in 3 months. His mom's gone, and I'm finally getting back on my feet. My son and husband have been getting sick a lot this last month, but I figured something was probably going around at his work. I've only just gotten back to mine.

So late last night:

I got up to soothe the little man during his nightly crying bouts, and I noticed his crib sippy cup was almost out of water, so I decided to refill him another one, and swap out.

As was my usual practice from those months ago, I pulled off the lid and valve to check inside before filling it...

Black mold. OMG. Next one.

The same. Forgive my yelling, but, *EVERY SIPPY CUP IN THE HOUSE HAD BLACK MOLD IN THE VALVES*. One of them had a thick crust of yogurt inside the nipple! I slipped into his room and stole his sippy cup, afraid of what I'd see, but hoping at least it was okay. Nope, it had a huge chunk of black in it! That one was so thick, it was a colony a full cm across!

I almost broke down crying. My husband likes to ""Demonstrate"" to my son how to drink from the sippy cup, to encourage him to drink more... that must be why he's been getting sick. Why my son's been pretty much perpetually sick for a month.

I spent the next two hours, nevermind that it was the middle of the night, boiling and steaming the damned things, trying to get rid of the black mold. I got one - just *one*, of seven of them - satisfactorily cleaned, but the rest, 2 hours of intensive work couldn't get rid of the black stuff. The valves are too small to clean out with a brush/sponse, it's soaking/treatment + rinsing only. Though I resorted to chopsticks...

His stupid, paranoid, overprotective, practically abusive, she's so obsessive and pushy, mom... she freaking blew me off! She ignored my system, and failed to clean the sippy cups, despite my initial warning, and later protests (for instance, she would keep the leftover yogurt in the sippy cup in the fridge for up to a day, to prevent food wastage, whereas with me, if he didn't finish it within an hour, it was dumped and cleaned. We had a talk about that and she *promised* me that she was being very careful to clean them)

I'm thinking of dumping all the damned sippy cups and replacing them entirely. I don't know if I can trust them, after being that slime encrusted and hard to clean...

I know you guys will know my pain. Just thought I'd share. I'm glad his mom's not staying with us right now, because getting arrested for first degree murder would probably not help our situation.

**TL;DR** My MIL ignored my warnings about how critically important it is to clean the sippy cups before they get hard to clean, while they were up here helping me recover from a back injury. Three months later, I discover black mold in all of my son's sippy cups.

Edit: For note, while my husband did, admittedly, fail to closely examine the nozzles and valves, he did resume the system, and did resume cleaning out the sippy cups after every use. If they hadn't already been thick with mold, so thick that a soak and rinse apparently does nothing, there would be no problem.

**Edit**: The original post also added my mother in the blame. But I really have no reason to believe she was responsible at all - she left as soon as my MIL arrived, about 6 weeks ago, and the boys didn't start getting sick till about a week after my MIL got here.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,1363285447.0,,blue,True,t3_1aa81x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1aa81x/im_so_incredibly_furious_at_my_mil/,

I'm pissed off.
Last night, I went to bed early hoping to get some sleep. Went to bed around 8:30 with son (he's 5 months old - 2 months preemie, so he's 3 months corrected). He wouldn't get to sleep. Finally when he did, I couldn't. Usually he'll wake up to eat, then go right back to sleep, but not this night. He woke up 4 more times, I fed him, he fussed and fussed then finally went back to sleep. 
Around 6:30 my 4 year old son came into our bed which isn't unusual because he gets itchy from eczema. baby was fussing a little bit but I knew with snuggles he'd be fine. I asked hubby to snuggle him and he got frustrated and said ""I have to be up in an hour!"" I said ""I have to be up in 2 hours and you've slept all night, I haven't"". he snapped ""I don't care if you don't sleep! I have to work!"" I said ""oh gee, thanks."" and rolled over to 4 year old, leaving baby with him. Baby kept fussing and hubby snapped again that he needed to feed. I didn't think so but I nursed him a bit anyways and gave him back. he kept fussing. Hubby asked if I gave him both sides, I said no, he's not hungry. Baby kept fussing, hubby AGAIN snaps ""Why is he doing this""? I said he's been doing it all night, he just needs to be held and maybe rocked. ""Did you ever think that's maybe because he's HUNGRY?!?!?!"" 
So I got mad and took baby back, put him on my arm, rubbed his cheek and he went to sleep in about 10 minutes. Meanwhile 4 year old is whining for hugs and hubby is snoring. Hubby gets up at 7:30, I sleep for a half hour and the boys wake up.

So, I got about 5 hours of sleep last night - if that - and hubby got about 9, and he ""doesn't care"".

My son was very needy since birth. I'm 100% sure some mother had it worse than me but since he was born, my son always screamed. He is happy but even when he smiles, he screams, he just...likes screaming. He still doesn't sleep through the night and wakes up a lot and he doesn't fall asleep on his own. I was okay with all of this until I gave birth to the sweetest baby on earth.

She is able to sleep on her own. She sleeps 3-4 hours on a row at night (my son doesn't do that yet), if I put her down, she doesn't scream and she can fall asleep on her own. 

They are totally different and that's okay but when I see her so quiet and him screaming just for the heck of it, I just start to like her more. I feel like I'm developing a preference for my daughter and I'm afraid that he will notice that over the years. I honestly feel guilty.

I am more than likely the age of your mothers. 

Tonight my 23 year old (who still lives with me because my house is huge and I would get lonely), comes home from work. I had made salmon loaf and a salad for dinner and it was ready when he came in the house. He isn't hungry. 

Then he says he is meeting a friend at a local market, so he leaves. Then the calls begin. He wants me to make him a corned beef and cabbage. But he doesn't want just any corned beef, he wants it from scratch. And he imagines that I can make this in the pressure cooker. 

Corned beef from scratch takes a week, just to brine the meat. Sadly, he knows I can make it. I don't have part of the brining ingredients on hand. He begins to call and text, asking what I need, then he gets irritated and won't answer the phone when I call him back. 

He comes home from the market with $30 worth of USDA choice brisket, one head of cabbage and a bag of red potatoes. That's all. He flings the brisket on the kitchen counter and says ""do what you want with it."" 

So, I brown the brisket, cut up an onion, mince 3 cloves of garlic, and throw that in the pressure cooker with water and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix. I cut up some potatoes for mash and set them on the stove with some water. I can hear the pressure cooker down there making its hissing noises right now. He is not going to get any food until about 10 PM, because he came back at 7:45. 

I am not complaining! 

Because as someone that is on the other end of where you all with babies are... I love the holy living hell out of my kids. I see what all the hard work has produced. I see the kids that work hard, have gone to school, and act like sensible adult human beings. I see the kids that  they laid on my stomach after labor, that I watched take their first steps, learn new things every day, the kids that I taught to read and  forced to practice their instruments. And I finally see what all that hard work is for. 

I have seen them pull away gradually on their way to adulthood and it was painful at times, watching them make stupid mistakes. Bringing down the hammer on discipline. Letting them take responsibility for their actions. I have watched them become individuals. They surely didn't turn out like I expected in any way and honestly, I never tried to force them to. 

But sometimes, a kid of mine wants dinner. Another kid will call me and ask me how I made that incredible pot roast or chicken. One of them will call and ask how to get out a stain from a work shirt. And I know that until my last breath, that I am always going to be there for them not only when they need me, but when they want me. 

Being a parent is a 24/7, full time career. And sometimes when you are in the thick of it, you feel like you want to scream. Some days they will drive you nuts and some days they will make you so happy you want to cry. It's a kind of love that you don't know until you have it, *that* you have it. 

So the next time you are walking the floor with a colicky baby, or wiping the spit up off that dress that has to be dry cleaned, that every moment with those selfish little beasts is precious. That some day you will watch your kid get a diploma. 

It's over in an instant, *I swear it.* You will be so busy you won't even notice the passage of time. But every story you read to them, every dinner you made, every t-shirt you washed will become part of them, and they will still look to you for support and comfort. You won't be forgotten. So do your best, every day!

I truly believe I'm being discriminated against!,jennielouu,61,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gdfhc/ive_just_been_demoted_at_my_job_and_i_am_still_on/,"I've been on maternity leave for almost 4 of the 6 weeks I am taking off and was invited in to attend a little lunch party with my office, mostly so everyone could meet my new son. When I came in I was given an unexpected performance review that concluded that I was to be demoted. I've worked for the company a little over 2 years but have only worked my new position for the last 10 months. During which I've recieved one write up - for a miscommunication issue between myself and our HR lady. The company I work for is very small. We have a total of 3 branches (one was just closed down a couple weeks ago) and each branch only has about 9-15 employees working inside the pharmacy and about 7-10 delivery drivers. My position was the delivery coordinator for my branch. My duties were overseeing the drivers, bagging medications for delivery, payroll, and overseeing expenses. On top of all that I took care of all the odd jobs, similar to secretarial duties.
They gave me a list of reasons for my demotion which included:


My write up. I was written up for having an employee start training before I cleared it with HR. This expecation was implemented earlier that week and was specifically in place to ensure we had new employee's drug test results and background checks completed before we hired them. (You'd think they would have had this in place in the beginning especially considering we were a pharmacy but no.) My HR lady and I were corresponding the entire day because she was sure that the results would be in that day and I had told her I was planning on training him that evening due to another employee quitting without notice. I trained him that evening with my fingers crossed hopping the results were in but they were not. That was a serious mistake on my part obviously.


It was my job to bring down our Courier expenses. I was to do this by sending drivers to make deliveries if they were in range without exception and implement another driver to make some long distance deliveries to some cities that were 1-3 hours away. We get a very good deal on those deliveries with our courier service as they charge only $12-$30 per delivery depending on distance. However, if you have 4 deliveries out to our furthest town at $30 a delivery we start to see a situation where it would be cheaper to send our own driver in our company car to make those deliveries. My pharmacist (the only person above me in my branch) requested me to create a sort of key for when those situations would be in our intrest to send our own driver. Figuring in information like gas and hourly pay for the driver. This took me almost a week to create as I also had my other duties on top of that. As it turned out, those situations were few and far between as we just didn't have the amount of deliveries to create situations where we would be saving money. I sent that report to my boss, who as usual did not respond for another week or so. Weeks after this, my HR lady contacted me and told me she wanted to go ahead with hiring another driver who would be based in one of those cities. I set about immediatly advertising a position and interviewing prospective employees. By this time my leave was coming up in a matter of days so in an effort to leave as little mess for the person who would be temporarily taking over my position I called my HR lady and asked her (since I've never hired anyone in a different town than our busness was in) where I should send the prosectives to take their drug tests, how I should go about getting their employee packets set up, if I should send another employee down there to train them or have them come to us, ect. She responed by telling me she was leaving on vacation and that I should direct those questions to my boss. He never responded.


While I was on leave, one of the delivery drivers were pulled over while driving a company vehical for reasons unknown to me. At that time it was discovered there was no insurance or registration in the vehical. Months prior to this those items were given to me I put them in the glove box of the car. There was no procedure in place saying I should check to make sure those documents were still there at any given time.
Payroll. I was visited by my boss in April to discuss new procedures (among other things). One of these were changes on how payroll was to be done. The way we reimburse our drivers for gas and use of their personal vehicles is a $2 tax free reimbursement per delivery made. These can add up very quickly depending on the area you are delivering to and the amount of deliveries made. For my boss's home branch a flat reimbursement of $2 per delivery works well enough. The drivers have lots of deliverys and easily make back at least what they spend on gas. My branch is a lot slower, and because of this we agreed to giving delivery drivers long distance fees of $10 per every 30 miles. In an effort to save money, I broke up that $10 to be $1 every 3 miles driven and to only be applicable to the furthest delivery made, and not the entire route. My boss was in support of this and we created a map of how this would work. While I was on leave I was instructed to have my pharmacist take over driver payroll. I trained her as best as I could but we both knew there would be time constraints on her that would make things difficult but there were no other options. Since then it is in my understanding payroll got messed up big time during my leave creating a huge mess for our main payroll lady. My boss who I created the reimbursement system with says he now did not ok this but I have a map with his handwritting with the exact same information as mine on it as evidence that he indeed worked on this system with me.


After making my case and pointing out the discrepancies with their reasons they said they still wanted to stick with their decision of demoting me in order to find someone who could be more receptive of their communication. That one write up was the only indication I've ever had that they were not pleased with my performance. The only feedback I've ever had on my performance was given by my boss during his only visit and that was to point out that I was going above and beyond his expectations and was pleased with how quickly 
I was learning Excel.


As I was leaving, my pharmacist said that at least now I will have better availability for my son. I truly believe this is discrimination. I can't afford loosing half my pay and all of my benefits. I have a hospital bills galore and daycare isn't even an option now with my pay cut. They can't even guarantee I will get 40hrs a week.

The birth was not straightforward and baby had to stay for one week in NICU. Now she's home, but my wife is finding it difficult to form an attachment to her, and she's also indicated that after just a few days she can't cope any more, and may have hinted at worse things also. I'm worried she may have postpartum depression, and if I was back in my country of origin I'd take her to see a doctor straight away.

However:

1. Her parents are living with us and both she and they believe in ""doing the month"" (坐月子) - the traditional Chinese practice where you don't leave the house for a month after giving birth. She can't go out to see friends (or doctors), nor even is she supposed to watch TV or use an iPad. The idea is that your body is so vulnerable just after delivering a child that any stress or strain (even a breeze) will cause serious health troubles when you're older.

2. Neither she nor they believe that Chinese people can suffer from PPD. They think it's a Western import. In China, people don't even talk about mental illness, let alone let others know when it afflicts you. It's even difficult to distinguish ""sadness"" from ""depression"" in the language. If any of her friends or colleagues have had it, they wouldn't let on, and she wouldn't want to raise the subject with them.

3. I highly doubt that the public healthcare system is equipped to deal with this. I've seen a lot of doctors in my time in China, and their bedside manner leaves much to be desired. I worry that we'd take her somewhere, the doctor would say ""没事！Take her home!"" and that would be that.

Are there are women here of Chinese extraction who've been through PPD? How did they make their families understand? Are there resources online in Chinese for PPD, maybe the blog of a mother who went through it? I could only find some bilingual pamphlets from American hospitals.

My most urgent task is to help my wife understand that this is what she may be suffering from, and then to help us figure out ways to deal with it.

You youngest, now 2 and 3 months goes to the local playgroup, it's handy and just down the street. This is good as it's the only one in walking distance as I can't afford to drive. [relevant information]

my elder one used to go and I never had any problems then but it was completely different staff as he went when both the current staff were on maternity leave. 

A few weeks ago a child escaped the playroom and was found in the corridor crying by a lady at the toddler group across the hallway. The staff didn't know he was missing until he was taken back in. Now this alone is a terrible incident but mistakes can be made, right? Once is a wake up call to add in more layers of safety and vigilance.

A week after a mum came in to pick up her little girl and found her outside in the carpark. She no longer attends and this incident was the first one anyone heard about although the staff never informed anyone. Two days later 3 boys were running around in the carpark and a granny had to come get the staff. [this last  bit is highly relevant]

last week it happened again with another boy slipping past into the corridor. Today there was an parent meeting about the situation.

Now, all through the meeting we're all getting told that parents involved were informed, care inspections are being done after complaints and all this. A gate is going up (only after 4 weeks of it all) we all finally know of how many known incidents there are and things seem to be getting done, meanwhile it's everythings fault except the staff. 

I go about the next few hours filling in the complaints form I go to pick up my little one, I walk out and a mum was waiting for me. she tells me my child was one of the 3 in the carpark. what. the. fuck?

they just sat for over an hour in that meeting fucking telling me the parents involved were told and here I am, and I am involved, and I heard nothing for 2 fracking weeks? WHAT THE FUCK?!

I am out of my mind with rage right now. I can't even.. 

I have to pull him out because it's not on! they didn't report the incident to me, they didn't write it in their incident books, they didn't change a goddamned thing. They sat there for over an hour and LIED to everyone. 

but if I pull him out I have nowhere else to take him for socialising and he really needs it he's so clingy. I need the couple of hours in the morning to spend one on one with my older boy. the only ppl suffering from this are us several times over and they'll just take a new parent off the waiting list who knows nothing about their dangerous negligence. 

ARRRGGHH!

Edit/Update: The governing body for childcare in Scotland has been notified. My kid's not going back today, I'll be down to the place on Thursday to pick up his stuff and some other bits and bobs. I'll still be going to the next parent's meeting after the Easter holidays as I still feel entitled to make sure things are moving along in a positive manner, also to suggest firing the staff in favour of better people.

The new landlord called saying there was a mattress and a little bit of garbage left there, he'd tale $50 off the rent if we just took that stuff outside and he'd pick it up this week. We though no biggie, just taking some stuff outside saves us fifty bucks. 

When we looked at this place people were still living there and it was kinda messy but the landlord assured us that the house would be cleaned, carpets washed, walls repainted, and repairs done. We really needed a place with that much space so we signed a lease with him, trusting that it would look much better cleaned up. 

He told us the house was open tonight and we could start moving stuff in. We still decided that we wouldn't move anything until tomorrow but we wanted to show SO's mom and sister the new place so we went by. 

We pull into the driveway and there is garbage piled up against the house past the first floor windows. We go in and the house reaks of feces, urine, and mold! There is rotting food in the sink, garbage, dirt, and random items all over the floor. The stove was pulled away from the wall and the floor underneath was full of grease, dirt, and small toys(previous tenants had a child). They left tooth brushes, pill bottles, and cigarette butts all over the bathroom. The tub was full of mold, the toilet was backed up. 

Only the living and dining room were repainted, horribly, paint all over the trim and drips on the hard wood floors. The carpeting was sticky and stained. Also what we were told was wall to wall carpet was just rough cut sections of carpeting thrown over rotting hardwood. When we viewed the place all edges were covered by furniture. The bedroom walls were scratched up, with huge areas of paint missing looking like it bubbled and chipped off. The floors were once again disgusting carpet covering linoleum that was pulling up off of rotting wood. All of the closet doors were broken or missing. And less than half of the lighting fixtures worked(we checked the bulbs and they were fine), all rooms had ceiling fans that were broken. 
So I called the landlord saying it was unacceptable. He just said he could take another 50 off of the rent for us having to clean, paint, and fix everything ourselves. His logic was that $100 would cover the only 10 hours it should take to do everything!! 

Then my SO opened the basement door and a cat ran out! The landlord claimed that non of his previous tenants had animals when we signed the lease because I asked because our daughter has very bad pet dander allergies. While on the phone with him tonight he claimed that his son ran the cat out of the house because it was left behind(great guys). The cat would coming running if we went anywhere near the kitchen cupboards, obviously used to being fed and it was hungry. 

After the landlord trying to reason with us that it's not that bad, after taking pictures of everything unsafe for anyone living there, and finding that poor cat, he finally told us that we can come pick up our security deposit and be done with it. 

I have never been so disappointed and heartbroken. We feel like we have let our daughter down because of this but there is no way we(or anyone else) could live there! We're staying at SO's mom's house for now but everything is packed away. 

I'm sorry about the length of this but I just had to get it out of my head and off my chest. I don't know how to feel yet.

I had the thought this morning that if he went away for a while, like for 3 months, that it would be OK with me.

I wasn't planning to get pregnant, and I very nearly had an abortion, but couldn't go through with it at the last minute. My son was born in December, and I've been home with him ever since. I don't feel like I have post-partum depression; I don't have any thoughts of harming myself or baby, I don't find it particularly difficult to take care of myself or him. But I don't feel a lot of joy, or fierce devotion, either. 

When he babbles, laughs or smiles, it warms my heart, and when he cries, I feel the urgent need to soothe him. The thought of him being hurt or sick breaks my heart. And yet, underneath it all is a degree of indifference to him being in my life at all. I don't relate to the parents who say they can't imagine life without their baby. I can, and in many ways, I miss that life. If you gave me the choice today of just letting someone else raise my son for a little while, I might say yes. 

I know there are thousands of people who would do anything to have a happy, healthy baby of their own, and I feel like a heartless, thankless shrew for feeling this way. 

Have any of you felt this way? Is this part of the spectrum of ""normal,"" or do I have a problem?

**Update**: Thanks for all your input so far, I really appreciate the different perspectives (not sure why I got downvoted for this post, but oh well). I will definitely bring this up when I see my doctor next week so that I can get a professional perspective.

For example, yesterday we were playing outside in the backyard, and it got to be time to go inside so I could start making dinner. I gave him advanced warning, and tried to get him excited about something we'd get to do when we got inside (let's go watch Thomas! or let's go inside and play with your cars!) but in his mind, he wants to do exactly one thing, and that's to run around outside and pick up sticks. So eventually I had to pick him up and bring him inside, and of course this resulted in a total meltdown.

So far his tantrums aren't violent, he doesn't hit or bang his head or anything, he just stands there and screams. Like ear-splitting, blood-curdling ""you'd think I'm sawing his hand off"" screams of agony. And he doesn't stop. Yesterday he stayed in the kitchen and screamed for about 20 minutes. Finally I went into the living room (where all his toys are) and he followed me, then he went over to his bookshelf and sat down and quietly looked at books by himself for another 20 minutes.

I'm still a total noob at this whole parenting thing, and I'm having trouble digging through the advice of ""ignore it!"" or ""don't ignore it!"" or ""redirect!"" and what have you. He's a very intense, spirited kid and redirection has never really worked. The only thing I'm certain about is that I don't want to do anything that he might interpret as getting his way or being rewarded for screaming like that.

So what do/did you do at this age with this kind of thing? I know it's normal and I'm not worried about it, but I really don't have any clue how to react and I think he can sense that.

Elimination Communication actually works.,RollerDoll,58,11,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/riafy/holy_crap_pun_intended_elimination_communication/,"Sooo... I have a 3.5 month old and decided to try elimination communication. I started by ordering the digital book from EC Simplified:  http://ecsimplified.com/book/.   I got a baby bjorn potty and have been basically offering it to her when she wakes up, about 15 minutes after a nursing, and otherwise every 30 minutes or if she's inexplicably fussy (not tired or hungry).  I know it sounds crazy time-intensive, but if it can save me a year or two of diapering once she is up and mobile, it will ALL be worth it.

For a week now, I've been having her play on an absorbent pad just in case of accidents - have only had about one per day. When she's not playing and I'm working, I have her in a Moby Wrap or Baby Bjorn. I've actually just been dressing her in pants sans diaper, and the crazy thing is, she really does not want to pee when I'm holding her or nursing her.  She really will hold it until I sit her on the potty, or she'll let me know she needs to go by getting squirmy and fussy.  The only time I have been using a diaper is during naps and at night.  (Crazy enough, if I get to her right when she wakes up from a 1-2 hour nap, she's still dry).

Believe me, if you haven't tried this, I know it sounds crazy... and I'm the furthest from a granola hippie you can get, so I was really skeptical of the whole idea.  But the benefits have been ENORMOUS.  She spends so much less time crying, and I'm not guessing at how to make her happy.  If she's getting upset and the potty doesn't work, I know she's hungry.  If she starts rubbing her eyes, I know she's tired.

Poop is a little harder to time, but most babies give you some warning.  They kinda don't meet your eyes and start bearing down and grunting.  So far, there's always been enough time to get to the potty (fingers crossed).  

I just didn't know it would actually work.  As my MIL pointed out, though (she's in public health), much of the world doesn't use diapers and the average age of pottytraining in those countries is 1 instead of 3 like the US.  She was interviewing Afghani women in a remote village, and one said that they have to train their babies in this manner early by 6 months, and can't use diapers b/c diaper rash would cause infections and kill them.

It works on the idea that babies have a natural instinct to not soil themselves... we actually train them INTO using diapers.  And it's really hard to break away from at 2 or 3 (or 4!) because that's when kids are developing their sense of self and will - they've got way better things to do than stop long enough to go to the bathroom, and they know the diaper will catch it if they're used to using one.  I know..... not very practical if you have more than one really young kid or work crazy hours... but apparently it can be just as effective if practiced part-time; the idea being that they really prefer to not sit in their poop or pee, and the idea of the potty is introduced early.

I know this was really long, but I just had to share my excitement with someone, and figured reddit must know!  :)

First of all, she's always doing all these huge grandiose things/favors for people and then gets butt hurt when they don't show her enough thanks. Personally I was raised to never do something for anyone because you want or expect thanks, you do it because it makes YOU feel good to help another human being out. But a simple thank you isn't enough for her she needs thank you notes praising her efforts or a thank you gift or a toe licking or whatever.

Ok, so she was a huge help to us packing up our apartment and moving in to our house (I was 8 months pregnant and my husband was going through some serious ulcer problems). Anyway, her idea of helping us pack was just throwing shit into boxes, our cable receiver and remote is just completely lost..fine whatever. I see things of mine randomly at her house like my $5-10 art pens and markers, vintage quilts and expensive nail polish and make up. Whatever, that's fine too but if she would have simply asked me for these things I would have happily obliged, feeling like I've been stolen from only perpetuates these negative feelings towards her. Another example, if she comes over and there is ANY dirty laundry she insists on taking it. Fine, but when I'm 7 months pregnant and have ONE pair of work pants and they mysteriously disappear only to see her wearing them 3 months later that's a problem. Also, when she takes my laundry they come back sometimes smelling like mildew and my whites stained pink. I can't tell if she's trying to help or being passive aggressive. When she was helping us unpack (on her own accord) she took all of MY files out of a small, plastic filing cabinet I had purchased and threw my files in with my husbands, now my birth certificate is missing thankfully, I located my SS card. She claims all of this is her just trying to help. 

More recently, every time she comes over she just cleans and it makes me nervous. It makes me feel like she feels like I'm not doing enough around the house. But in reality it doesn't matter how much or how little I clean because when she comes over she cleans from the time she gets here till the time she leaves. I just wish she could sit on the stupid rug...vacuumed or not and spend time with her grandson and I. 

I tried voicing my opinion to her and it led to her usual freak out of feeling unappreciated and unloved. She's allowed to feel however towards whomever but how dare I voice my feelings!! I'm just done. I wish I wasn't but I am. Since I haven't apologized for my feelings yet I've had to endure a 5 day silent treatment. And guess what? I have no fucks to give.

""Yet Chinese mothers rarely breast feed, concerned that the quality of their breast milk is poor. And even with all the formula scares, which are increasingly covered in the Chinese press, breast feeding remains unpopular.""

In raising our kids (one boy and one girl), we've tried to instill our beliefs - that boys and girls are equally able to do boy-ish things (play with trucks or superheroes) or girl-ish things (cook, play with dolls) as they like.  Still, my family (who live very close and see the kids almost every day) are constantly undermining us.  They tell my son to ""man up"" and stop crying if he is upset, but they coddle my daughter for the tiniest thing.  If he is pretending to make dinner for everyone, they tell say ""ewwwww, that's for girls"".  If my daughter wants to play in the dirt with her brother, they tell her girls can't get messy.  I've had numerous conversations (and near-yelling matches) with them about it, but they just don't seem to care. My son's preschool also seems to push gender-definition in a way that leaves a sour taste in my feminist mouth.

Also, I was raised Catholic. My husband's family is non-denominational Christian.  But neither of us believe in God and we've decided not to raise our kids religiously. Both of our families disagree with this choice, and try to teach our kids about God.  My four year old is constantly asking me why God made something the way it is and when I say ""I don't think God made pancakes, baby. People make pancakes"" he always says ""but Uncle so-and-so told me that...."".  My inlaws enrolled my son in bible-camp last summer WITHOUT ASKING US!

So, how do y'all deal with people teaching your kids things you don't like (or are actively opposed to)? Where do you draw the line and just cut these people off? Or am I overreacting?

edit: un-splicing commas.

edit: Thanks so much for the useful tips and perspective. I actually just ended up printing out the thread (my mom's not much for the interwebz) and plan on going over it with the people we're having problems with.  I really don't want to have to cut them off - and, until they start telling my kids that we are wrong for not believing or telling them scary stories about hell - I don't think it'll be necessary. I hope that talking it over and presenting my family with few different view points will help. I also plan on keeping in mind that this is a chance for me to teach my kids about what I really value - being kind, open-minded, and rational.

My son will be three in September and he is not potty trained. We've worked on it a little bit but he just doesn't seem ready. Apparently this is a huge issue for everyone except for his father and I. 

I am so tired of being told that I'm (basically) a lazy mother for not working around the clock to make sure that my LO is out of diapers at an ""appropriate"" age. To me, it's not a huge deal. It doesn't bother me to change his diapers and he's not behind in any other area. I'm not stressing out about it and I'm pretty sure that as his mother I will know when he's ready for this stage. 

I really wish other parents would stop inserting themselves and their opinions into my life. I have a wonderful son who is constantly getting complimented for being such a ""good kid"" but yet you think I'm failing for not meeting YOUR timelines on ONE thing? 

Sorry this is so jumbled, just needed to get it out. I'm very frustrated and I'm trying really hard not to let others opinions make me feel like a failure.

I had my daughter on February 20 and she will be 6 weeks old on Wednesday this week. The first 5 weeks were easy, for a newborn, but then we spent the last week in the hospital running tests and scans, her getting poked and prodded at. Not fun times for little baby at all.

While we still don't know a ton, we know enough that I'm sharing what we do know now. We were at the hospital with her in the emergency room from 6pm-midnight on Wednesday then the Pediatrics ward until Friday evening when we were finally released to go home because she is having seizures. Not a great reason to be there.

Her dad and I were discussing that we thought she had a cold around Monday or so because he had a cold and i had a sore throat. Later that night she was sleeping on my chest and started sucking in air strangely and jerking her whole body in towards the core. It was periodically pulling in towards her center in a pattern similar to hiccups. I thought it was that she couldn't breathe because her noise was plugged and she wasn't breathing in through her mouth so i tried to open her mouth and get her attention and then it just stopped. I didn't think much of it. But then it happened again later and i said something to her dad and he said that she'd done it while he was holding her too. He didn't seem too concerned but I knew it was something I'd never seen before and that made me nervous.

I tried to google it and found normal infant jerky limb movements due to their still developing nervous systems, and seizures. Welcome to the age of ""cyberchondria"", you know? So her dad basically said he wasn't worried about it but that if i was worried about it to call the Dr. So i did and initially they told us to come in to the Dr office at 5pm then called back and said the nurse wanted to talk to us. The nurse got a description from us and went to talk to the Dr and the Dr said to go into the er because they could run tests and do scans that they couldn't do at the pediatricians office. 

We went to the er. They checked her blood oxygen, blood sugar, did a ct scan (came back normal), took blood and urine for testing, and finally sent us to a room up in Pediatrics. During the time we were in the er she had 4 episodes of what we now know were her having seizures. The final time it was finally seen by someone other than just myself or her dad, one of the er doctors.

After we went to the room they told us we were waiting for the neurologists to come in the morning so we tried to get some sleep, myself about 3-4 hours, I'm thinking dad got about 5 so not much more. When the neurologists came in they asked us for some information and said that since it wasn't really obvious what was going on that they were putting in an order for a 24 hour EEG (brain wave/activity monitors) and said that they might know something later today, if not then definitely tomorrow. They set her up on the EEG and i think we flagged about 3 or so episodes when the neurologist came in and said it's definitely seizures. He said they were going to start her on iv medications to try to control them and were still waiting on the test results. They gave her a keppra loading dose by iv at about 4pm then more orally at around 3am and it seemed like things were finally changing. We hadn't seen her have any seizures for quite some time.

The Dr came in to talk with us the next morning. He said the neurologist had said it isn't infantile spasms which is what a lot of people online on the forum I'm part of were trying to say it sounded like, because it lacks the specific markers for that on the eeg scan. He called it ""focal motor seizures"" and said it meant it comes from a specific part of the brain and the motor part was the movements. The neurologist had pointed to an area at the top middle of his head when he was in telling us that they were for sure seizures yesterday, and this Dr indicated the same area on his head. They didn't have a cause yet still and we were still waiting for the organic compounds test results. He said the neurologist would be in later, most likely after the 24 hours was passed on the eeg, to discuss things in more detail, and that they would do their best to keep us updated as soon as they knew anything.

Later on the neurologist came in and told us similar information to what the Dr had said. That it was focal motor seizures. That the medication seemed to be working. That she hadn't had any seizures since 7pm the night before. They says that they might be sending us home that day depending on the pediatric team's thoughts.They disconnected her from the EEG around noon and a new Dr came in and was observing her and she had 2 seizures in front of this Dr. This caused them to go off and debate whether they were going to let us go Friday or if they wanted to keep her longer, overnight for more observation.Ultimately they decided that keeping her wasn't going to change much so they released her with a prescription to be picked up and orders to make an outpatient appointment with another neurologist and with her pediatrician in 5 days. They said that they are waiting for test results that won't come back until Sunday at the earliest.

So this is where I get confused a bit. After we got home she was still having seizures so we called and they said to give her the 0.5 ml dose of keppra 6 hours early and then in 12 hours to up her dose to 0.7 ml since she was still having seizures. They knew she was still having them prior to her last dose at 3pm at the hospital before we were released to go so why didn't they up the dose then?

She was still having seizures even after the early extra dose and that worried me. We were kinda talking about possibly calling or going in to children's or Swedish. They want to send her in for an mri at one of those places anyway and something was better than sitting here doing nothing but waiting. But we needed some sleep and the hospital we were at had sent us away knowing she was still having them so them being amazing professional doctors we figured they knew what they were talking about. So we went to bed at home for the first time since Wednesday.

The next day we were talking about going to children's or Swedish and my overly involved family (I love them but sometimes they can be a bit much) were talking about stuff and most of it not to me. My cousin even went so far as to text me "" If you don't take her to the dr and something happens to her you could go to jail for child neglect. You can't want that"" and prior to that had told me seizures can cause brain damage and that the baby needs a Dr and etc... The Dr sent the baby home knowing she was having seizures still. I'm pretty sure that you can't go to jail for taking your baby to the Dr and having them send you home with instructions to follow up with other Dr's in 5 days. I'm pretty sure that they wouldn't call that neglect either. I ignored that text. We went to children's anyway because my mom who was in town till this morning from out of state showed up and basically demanded we take her there when we were already planning on going there anyway ourselves (like i said, overly involved.. And pushy)

At children's we spent several hours in the er waiting for them to see something and for them to get records from valley. Her dad finally got it recorded on camera and they finally got the records from the other hospital after about 2 hours. They called the neurologist she had already been seen by and agreed to start her on an additional medication called phenobarbital. They did a loading dose of that and then gave us a prescription for it.

They kept her for observation for an hour and then released us to go with orders again to make an appointment asap with the neurologist and also her pediatrician. She hasn't had any seizures that we have noticed since starting three second medication. We have an appointment with her pediatrician tomorrow and the neurologist on Thursday. They will refer us to get an mri. And hopefully then after an mri we might have some answers as to what exactly the cause of her seizures is. 

Anyone have any experience with this who can offer up some information or support?

My wife is a stay-at home mom. She has a college degree, but chose to quit working when our son was born since we are fortunate enough to be able to live on my income alone. (When we bought a house, we knew she would probably not keep working, so we found one that I knew I'd be able to pay for on my existing salary.)

I may earn the money, but she works harder than I do, being a great mom, keeping the house clean, cooking meals almost every night to save money (not to mention she's great at it), and this family would fall apart without all her effort.  

Unfortunately, she often feels various negative vibes from working moms.  Sometimes she feels like they look down on her for being ""just a housewife.""  Other times she feels like they resent her for being able to stay home with our son and not being required to leave the kid in daycare and go to work.  I can certainly understand both of these mentalities, depending on the position and desires of the people who give out these vibes.  Unfortunately some of these people are our friends. (EDIT: only some; most of them are from miscellaneous strangers or acquaintances.)  But regardless of the source, it makes my wife afraid to open up to working moms about her joys and her struggles.

So I'm just curious how you all feel about stay-at-home moms.  We really just want to know if other stay-at-home moms feel these vibes from other moms, and if working moms feel negatively about those who stay home, either out of jealousy or disdain.

I'm sure it will be very unpopular to express any dislike for them (especially after I've just praised my wife for all her hard work), but if that's how you really feel, please be honest -- and nobody else downvote them if they're being straightforward and answering the question.  Open communication from different moms can really be helpful for everyone.

She will only sleep in her travel system. I have had no luck getting her to sleep longer than a few minutes in her crib. I tried cosleeping for the first few months, but it was no better, and my husband never got any sleep. She and I have moved to the nursery with me on a cot next to her travel system.

I read No Cry Sleep Solution and implemented many of the strategies but she just wakes up too many times to put a sleep plan in place. I would literally have to be up all night long. I really, really don't want to let her CIO. I've tried the attended CIO for a few hours and I just couldn't take it. She has a bedtime routine and a ""lovey."" She goes down around the same time every night (7-7:30) and wakes herself up around the same time every morning (6-7, sometimes 7:30 if she's up for that 3-hour stretch). I put her down for naps as soon as she's tired. She had a problem taking longer than 30 minute naps, but I've been sitting in on  part of the naps and rocking her stroller through the transitions, so she's beginning to nap longer but with no improvement in the night wakings. I have read and read and read and have never found a description of a baby waking this frequently, which makes me feel even more alone and upset. 

We tried having dad respond to her crying, but he didn't handle it well and he has to work early. We have NO ONE else to help; neither of us has family involved in our lives or friends in a position to help, and she cries when a stranger comes near her. 

She is EBF and only just now is beginning to accept a bottle, but will only eat an ounce or so over a couple hours and then demands to be nursed. I'm beginning to really hate nursing and am considering switching to breastmilk in a bottle to see if that will help. I'm considering starting rice cereal before bed (as various people have been pushing for months but her doctor said not to do). 

She has no symptoms of reflux. She doesn't seem to have a belly ache. I don't consume gluten or dairy. She is happy during the day (except for the tiredness, of course.) 

I feel like I'm going to go insane. I'm so tired. I miss my husband. I miss my bed. I want to enjoy my baby (and my other children). There seems to be no end in sight. I don't know what to do, but I can't keep doing this. I sometimes feel resentful and angry towards my beautiful baby (though I know it is obviously not her fault.) Between night sleeping and naps, my whole life is consumed by these sleep issues. 

How do I get her to sleep outside the stroller? How do I get her to sleep longer? How can I get my life back without making her suffer?

**TL;DR -- My 6-month-old wakes up 8-24 times a night including a long stretch, will only sleep in her travel system, and I am losing my mind (and straining my marriage). :(**

*Edit: Bold TL;DR

**Edit: Thank you sooo much for all the ideas and responses; you are all so thoughtful! I am overwhelmed by all the support.

I'm currently in a relationship with my sons father we celebrated our 2 year anniversary this past may, so you could say we moved real fast.

I've found myself today realizing i'm faking things and i'm depressed. One thing my parents always stated was that they were each others bestfriend an when me and my fiance first started out he was mine, i dont feel like that anymore is that normal? is your significant other still your bestfriend? Also I no longer have any passion what so ever towards him, I try I really want it there but i just dont feel it. Is the passion still there for you? Does his kiss still drive you crazy after years? Do you still have passion while being intimate? Cause I don't feel those things anymore and I'm starting to think thats a huge issue but i dont know...

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their advice and reassuring me most of the feeling i have are normal and come and go in relationships. I also want everyone to know that when i was in high school and the year after before i met my SO I had on and off slight depression, not wanna hurt myself or others just the constant sadness and when i went through that before i questioned everything in my life. I came to realize i'm going through it again and its more my issue with me than actually issue with my relationship and that's something thats hard for me to realize seeing that not a single soul knew i went through it before.

2 months after we got married my husband was laid off of his job. One and a half years later he is still without a reliable job (he has a part time job with very little hours working for me just to try to make ends meet). Normally I'd say, ""this is due to a bad economy"" or something else to justify him not finding a job, but I recently logged into his email (we know each other's passwords) and found that he's barely applied to any jobs at all in the last year and half. He admitted he hasn't been trying.
during this time, he's sunk deeper and deeper into his own world and has given up on... well, everything. He doesn't support me, refuses to have sex with me, and actually makes my daily life and daily tasks harder. I agreed he could be a stay at home dad while I work hard for the family if he helped me clean up but he won't even do that. I come home often and the place is a mess and I even told him I'd help with any chores he needed me to but he needs to ask me for the help, but this hasn't happened.
One benefit to him is that he watches our 2 year old son while I'm at work but lately, he seems to be losing interest in doing a good job at that, too which is the hardest thing for me to watch. When I try to ask him why he is being snippy, or mean, to our son he just lashes out at me and acts like I am over-critical. I've tried to support him, provide moral support, and even threaten him with ultimatums and deadlines and none of it has worked.
At what point do I call it quits? My life would honestly be easier without him and I have tried so hard to connect with him and work on this together. Also, I suggested couples counseling but we can't even afford the copay right now.

Advice Needed: 
How do you help someone who is closed off? How long do I hold on and deal with this? My son loves my husband but can tell I'm not happy. I think that is the hardest part of all of this. :/




***************EDIT*****************
Thanks everyone for your replies.  I've seen both sides of the arguments and taken a lot into account. Some of your insights have really helped me understand a little further and others...well, not so much :)

I have made an appointment and he is on-board. Also, he actually had an interview today! That's a huge step and I'm really proud of him.  He wants me to go to the appointment with him and I hope to learn more about depression and what our options are.  He is a very good dad but like all of us he has bad days and marriage is about being there on the bad days.  If I got an illness or depression I wouldn't want him to walk out on me the second things got hard.  If things continue to spiral and he has no want or care to get better I would have to call it quits but if he has a willingness to work on himself and our marriage I will be with him loving and supporting him.

The strangest part of this scenario is that I always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom.

First of all the NICU (or any long hospitilization for a child) is very stressful, if the parent has other kids give them a date night to try to relax a little. One of the things that helped me the most is keeping game nights on Friday nights with my friends. It gave me a chance to laugh. So help them have some fun and don't ask why they aren't with their child. Although they probably will call to check in!

Come visit the NICU (If you are healthy and the hospital permits). Although there can be a lot of people around it is actually quite lonely. So when people would come I felt less alone.

Help the parents celebrate the little things, you may not understand it but there are tons of little milestones and while you might not think they are major, the parents do and need some outside support ie: first bath, first real bath, first outfit, first newborn outfit, when they are healthy enough for vaccinations, when they get to be in a crib. There are plenty of tiny firsts that I was so glad I could realize them, and loved when our friends and families got excited with us.

Understand that their lives have completely changed, they might not be up on current topics, you will have to be patient with the constant talking about baby because that is their world physically and emotionally. It will get better.

When they get home they will be in Baby Jail. Since the baby can't go into large crowds for an extended period of time they will need a care giver at home for most of the days. So come visit break up there days a bit if you can even after work.

I have this friend, we've been friends since high school, going on 7 years now. She has a 3.5 year old. He's huge. Literally the size of a 5 year old. About to grow out of his 5t cloths. He's wild. Because he's so big with with the mind of a 3 year old he gets into everything. Baby gates don't stop him. He once climbed onto the bathroom counter and got into the stop shelf of the medicine cabinet and got the Q-tips and put some in his ears. He then jumped on the bed and ended up jamming one so far in his ear was bleeding and he had to go to the ER.

I realise my friends life is hard. She never even wanted kids and her husband is little to no help with him. I know her parenting style differs from mine in that she mostly just doesn't even try to stop him anymore because it's just easier to clean up the mess behind him. I know she is dealing with depression. I'm not pretending to understand everything she's going through. My son is 16 months, and mostly an angel.

But she blames everything wrong in her life on the kid. And I understand her life would be much simpler without the kid and she could do what she wanted. But there comes a point where you just have to take responsibility.

She's been complaining about her computer lately. She hates windows 8. Ok, I've never used windows 8, I'll take her word on it till I do. But now it's less than a month old and it's having problems booting up. She says she's 99% sure the kid hasn't gotten a hold of it, it hasn't been dropped or had anything spilled on it. I suggest she takes it back. She can't. Why? Because she bought it at the BX and they don't take returns she'd have to send it to the manufacturer. Ok. So send it to them. Can't. Why? Someone(the kid) lost and or destroyed the receipt and any other paperwork she might need.

So I ask if there is nowhere in the house where you keep important paperwork? No, the kid gets into everything. Ok...what about your husbands guns? He's got a lot, here is somewhere safe for them right. So then you can get somewhere safe you just haven't. You bought an expensive computer, and you know that your son is destructive and you didn't do everything you could to keep these things you might need from him. It's not the 3 year olds fault. Where do you keep your tax papers? Yous birth certificates? your car paperwork? Surely you haven't let him destroy all that?

I was never mad at her. My whole family is sick and I'm a little short on patience, but I was just trying to tell her that she is accountable for things like this. That I won't always sympathise with her when she blames the kid. It's kinda of a toxic mentality, and if I agree with her enough eventually I'll turn into that kind of person who blames the husband and the kid for everything.

Her husband and mine are best friends. And I usually enjoy hanging out with her, it's just when she is home, which is 2 hours away from me, all she does is complain like this on the computer. Usually its about how it feels like a waste of time when you clean the house and then the kid destroys it immediately. I've given up and trying to give her suggestions like taking him outside where its ok to be destructive, but she doesn't like going outside so it rarely happens. He's too big to play with other kids his age, and not mentally ready to play with other kids his size. The times she does take him to the park the other kids who think he is 5 are mean to him cause he is ""stupid"".

I don't want to just stop being friends with her, she's one of my only friends, and she'd do anything for me, she is a good person and a good friend, I just don't think she is cut out to be a stay at home mom. She wants to get a job, but her husband and her argue about it because of the cost of daycare. I can't keep agreeing with her and she takes it way too personally when I disagree.

Arg. Anyway, thanks for reading. Feel free to vent about people who irritate you or give me suggestions on dealing with her. Sorry to be so negative, I hate getting this way, but if I talk to my husband about it, he'll try to help by talking to her husband and it'll just get worse.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,orange,True,t3_1gze1a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gze1a/youre_the_parent_rant/,

And I know, it could be worse. But hear me out. 

The first thing I usually see is dishes left on the floor by my fiance. Or empty beer bottles, trash, etc. He leaves for work super early in the morning (like 2 am) and works til the afternoon. I get it, he works a lot. But I don't think its fair to pick up after him all the time. 

Ok, not all the time. Maybe once a week he picks up our bedroom, but that's it. I asked him to do one chore 3 days ago, and guess who is getting ready to do that today. 

The worst part is, I waste all morning cleaning and cooking. And all afternoon. I don't get to really play with the kids as much as I like. By the time I'm done with everything, I have to go to work and he gets to come home and the only thing he does is heat up the dinner I made them, change a diaper, and brush their teeth. If I work a short shift I get to come home and do this too. 

We are blessed that we have family that takes the kids on weekends, takes them boating, swimming, to church, etc. Because I work 10+ hour days on the weekends and the family loves seeing them. It sucks that I never really get a day off. Either I'm taking care of the kids and then going to work, or working all day. I know I'm probably pissing off a lot of stay at home or single moms; this probably sounds like first world problems to you guys, and I'm sorry. It just makes me sad that on weekends when they're not here, he is off work but doesn't do much except see his friends and relax. Which he is entitled to do. But it would be great if he could cross a couple things off my to-do list while I'm gone. 

And like I said, I get it. He works a lot. But I do too. I am starting to feel kind of worthless. I should be able to handle all this. I did great as a single mom. But when I have someone here who should be sharing the responsibility, and isn't, I have to ask myself what I'm doing wrong and why he doesn't think I need a break. It's getting harder and harder to just get out of bed because my life is constant work, no breaks (except to browse reddit on my phone while I'm cooking or whatever), and nothing to show for it-as far as having a good time with the kids. When we talk about it he gets all mad and tells me he's tired. I'm tired too but I guess that doesn't matter. ):

I hope it's okay to share this here.

A year ago on Wednesday I gave birth to 7 pound 13 ounce little girl named Zia. I think back to those first few days and remember being so proud, shocked, and confused. Here was this new little stranger that I knew I loved but it seemed impossible. I felt her kick inside me but seeing her was such a shock and weird experience. First of all, I have always felt very average to unattractive as far as women go but this baby girl was BEAUTIFUL. It took me a few weeks to not feel like I was hanging out with a beautiful stranger and to feel like she was a part of me.

Now, a year later, I am so attached to this child I feel embarrassed sometimes. I turn down family offering to babysit because I know i will miss her all night and talk about her too much. She is so funny, intelligent, and gorgeous. She is a one year old so I can't voice to her yet how stinking proud I am of her. Tonight I realized though, the pride I feel for her is nothing compared to how proud I feel of myself.

I'm pretty modest. I don't like a lot of attention but I deserve to pat myself on the back this time.  I've been a SAHM for a year even though I desperately miss working and being with adults. I've made the best of it. We do lots of activities and play all day. Also, I have breastfed her for a year. Realizing that tonight literally took my breath away. We had every breast feeding problem you can name; nipple shield, mastitis, MSPI, oversupply, GERD, and low supply. Yet I still got through a whole year.

I'm not the perfect mom at all. I cannot count the times I just had to walk away and leave my daughter with her dad because I was so frustrated. I have used the tv to keep her distracted so I could read a book. She is still sleeping in my bed every night, and nursing throughout the night almost every night because I am too worn out to really push any type of sleep training. I have yelled at her a few times and one time slammed her hand in the door by accident. I am not perfect but I am still proud of myself and my daughter. 

One year down, the rest of my life to go. Maybe this year she will sleep in her own bed :)

Our toddler got up when we went to bed and asked if she could sleep in momma's room. I said sure. Her dad disagreed and tried to rush her back to her bed. I tried explaining that as parents, our kid is going to want to sleep close to us sometimes. That she might be scared. We could let her fall asleep with us and lay her down back in her own room if he had a big problem with it. Or that I could go cuddle with her in her room until she goes to sleep, and sneak out. Either way, I wasn't going to shut her into her room crying (she's normally a really good sleeper!) and possibly scared. He said, 'whatever' and went downstairs to sleep on the couch and I went to cuddle with my daughter in her room until she fell asleep. I fell asleep for a bit too. Our huge bed was completely empty for a good part of the night. And that seems wrong.

What's happened? How can someone not want to comfort their kid, or allow the mom to? I can see how, this could be a problem if she asked everynight but she hasn't ever, even once, before this. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I did what I felt right doing. Idk.

Update2: A few things first: Thanks for all the helpful replies! Really appreciated right now. Not sure where everyone's getting that he's sleep deprived. We were just going to bed, it wasn't in the middle of the night. There was no fatigue or sleep deprivation to dismiss everything on. It was maybe 11pm. If you think there may be something I left out--ask me about it! Unless I record conversations, I'm sorry but I can't share them word-for-word. *I* was sleepy and cranky (new diet) and still managed to list options and be tirelessly diplomatic. Regarding whether or not he was upset because I was neglecting him, I'd like to say that's most definitely not the case. Overall, I felt like I suddenly had two kids and woke up wondering what happened to my husband.
I posted this so that I can get outside opinions on a snapshot of how we behave. Ofcourse, other things have happened that are of more consequence than this and continue to do so. I know that, someday, I may have a big decision to make that I'm not looking forward to.
I talked to him about all this and it seems he was trying to make a stand against this becoming routine (she and I had taken a nap together in mommy's room a few days before) and he felt that she would've been 'fine' and that I should've let him put her back to bed. He went downstairs so that he could be 'out of the way'. And then we managed to start another argument when he said that he was already upset at me because I've started a new diet that 'limits' the rest of the family (buying my own foodstuffs with my own pay- there's been no toll on him or our daughter save for there's a hell of alot more bread in the house.)
Things aren't peachy-keen now by any measure, but life goes on.
Now, I'm wondering if I saw a cuddling opportunity and just wouldn't let go of it. :3 Idk. I guess, If my daughter needs me, is crying, and screaming for me like she was, I'm going to be there one way or another. He can choose to cuddle with us, or not.

My daughter had been down to one breastfeed a day for a couple of months then a few days ago she decided to drop that last feed. 

Yesterday I was not coping. At all. Everytime she cried I asked myself why I even had her. I was so angry. And so racked with guilt. How could I dislike my baby so much? She hadn't done anything. She was awesome last week, why not now?

Then I clued on. I wasn't breastfeeding anymore. My body has changed again. Bye bye hormones. Once I realised that the anger and guilt started fading away. And now things are back to normal. Remembering yesterday is like looking at a different person, that's how upset I was. And how quickly things have normalised.

It seems so obvious now but no one warned me about my hormones going mental. So in case no one warned you I just wanted to let you know that when you stop breastfeeding it might be really awful for a day or two but IT WILL PASS!

I dread their visits for a month, then spend a couple of weeks getting over it. This one wasn't the worst, but it's never good.

My FIL is completely overbearing and everyone walks on eggshells around him because he enjoys baiting people into arguments. He must feel so small, its just pathetic. He will literally throw a tantrum if you prove him wrong. He also makes lewd comments at me in front of his wife and my husband. His wife (not my husband's mom, she got out years ago) rolls her eyes and laughs it off. my husband acknowledges that his dad is horrible and apologizes to me in private, but ignores it to his face because that's just how he's dealt with his behaviour all his life. 

I've tried everything. Last time I screamed and cursed in his face, which he enjoyed. This time I just calmly told him he was being inappropriate and it stopped for the rest of the visit. It's like he just thinks he's being outrageous and funny, just like his racist and homophobic ""jokes"" are outrageous and edgy. He seemed to be looking for an ""in"" to take me down a notch for the rest of the time, just generally being contrary and obnoxious to anything I said or did. I don't want to be the person to cut my kid off from his grandparents, so I just bear the visits, and I don't badmouth them to him. I guess I want my son to notice how I deal with the situation (as directly as I've ever dealt with anything) rather than causing a huge drama which would result in split visits and circulating lies. He'll figure it out on his own.

He constantly buys us things because he ""loves us so much"". I feel like I'm being bought off, and although I can handle myself, I still feel like a doormat and I resent that my husband doesn't stick up for me. I would be OK with never seeing these people again, but it's not really just my choice alone, so the most I can do is calmly discuss things with my husband, wait for the abuse, deal with it rationally in front of everyone, and set limits as it happens. 

I don't know why I posted this, I mostly just want it off my chest. I am still just sad, angry and disappointed that I have to even point out what's wrong to my family.

I clash all the time with both boys. I know I've screwed them up already...afterall the ""first five years are the most important."" As horrible as this sounds, I wish we had never had kids. I don't want them to grow up hating me or repeating this horrible existence..but we can't seem to get anywhere with them. I am more of a disservice to them I feel.

Our oldest is 4, youngest is 2. One's a boy and one's a girl.  When we're home, we're usually undressed. Always at least in underwear. Often naked. Especially during the summer. It's 95 degrees outside and A/C is expensive! Because we do everything without clothes on, we often touch the kids while they're undressed and they touch us. Not like we're wrestling or humping one another, but every now and then somebody grazes a butt or a boob or the kids (innocently) hug each other.

I've never felt uncomfortable about it and figured we'd just kind of evolve into wearing clothes whenever it started to get weird for us, but lately my mother (who lives less than 5 minutes away and likes to stop by unannounced) has started making comments about us going without clothes in front of the kids and about the kids being naked in front of each other. She seems especially bothered by the idea that there is any skin-to-skin contact. According to her, it's just not normal and NO ONE does it. I know nothing improper is going on, and no one in our household is uncomfortable, so we're not changing the dress code for now, but he fact that Mom's so weird about it has started me wondering:

Recently our 2 year old 110lb lab mix, Taggart,  has appeared on my daughter's radar. Whether she thinks he's a less hairier version of daddy or a real life stuffed animal, I don't know. What I do know it that she has started reaching out and leaning towards the dog whenever he's near her as well as calling him over with her ""eh eh eh"" sound she makes when she wants attention. The most I've let the two interact is his sniffing at her and occasionally licking her through the crib slats when she rolls over and reaches out for him. Until today.

After waking up from her afternoon nap, the little one was all the way at the edge of her crib. In walks Taggs and walks up to her. Immediately her hands shoot out of the slats and she starts reaching for the dog. After a ""is it ok, mommie?"" look he starts giving her puppy kisses on her chubby hands. She giggles. A few minutes later she's on the changing table and constantly rolling over onto her tummy while eh-ing at the dog. He's at my feet looking up at her wagging his tail. 

I take the angel and we sit in the glider in the nursery and I call the dog over to us. He slowly walks up to her and tentatively starts with the licking with one or two kissies making it to her face. Then the rolling giggles begin. She ""pets"" him and is rewarded with another kiss. This goes on for 15 minutes. Not once did my puppy get overexcited and start jumping nor did my daughter look bored. She was enthralled by the chocolate lab and his soft fur and wet nose. 

After the fun, a good hand and face washing was had but she was in happy spirits all though her meal of sweet potatoes. 

I wonder what the future adventures these two will get into when she's older... ",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,lightcoral,True,t3_oei1t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/oei1t/i_just_made_my_75_month_old_daughters_day/,

Last weekend, we went on a family road trip and it was a disaster. My son was crying and cranky for most of the trip (he was not sick I think maybe he is teething). It made me hate being a mother. At some point, I was wishing that I could go back in time and not gotten pregnant. Now I dread being at home with him, whenever he is awake I have to remind myself that I love him and to be patient with him.

On top of all this, I moved to Germany 6 months ago. I don't speak the language (I'm learning it on my own because is difficult to take clases while taking care of my son) and I have no friends. Also, I'm dark skinned so sometimes when I go out for a walk people stare at me (mostly with curiosity) and it makes me feel self aware and out of place which contributes to me not wanting to leave the house.

I just feel so sad and pathetic like I'm in this awesome situation (I'm living in Germany, my SO is great, my son is healthy, etc.) that I'm not appreciating.

-----

I know some people know this already, but please check the factory temp on your hot water dispensers (the big blue jug ones from Ozarka, etc).  

I know for a fact now that Ozarka's hot water comes out at 180f/82c after my son was involved in an incident at his daycare (finally got the job I was waiting for and could afford it!!!) where a four year old broke the child lock equation and filled a cup with hot water, discovered it was undrinkable, and set it down.  My son (newly two) then picked it up and attempted to drink it, burning his lip and chin, then spilling it down his shirt.  He was quickly attended to, but the damage had been done- his skin was peeling away and blistering.  

He was rushed to the local hospital while I was contacted at work.  When I got to him, he was ready for transport to the children's hospital where they treated pediatric burn victims and we rode by ambulance.  I spent the next 9 hours listening to my baby alternate between sobbing, screaming, begging for food/drink while we waited for the trauma team to come give him ketamine and perform a debridement on his chest and chin.  

I guess this is just as much a public service announcement as it is a way of coping.  I didn't realize how upset this could still make me- my hands are shaking and my throat is burning.  We all know to cook on the back burner and turn pots handles in, to turn the water heater down to the child safe setting, to child proof bathrooms.  I didn't, in my wildest nightmares, think that a water dispenser could cause that much damage.  His daycare provider is devastated and had the offending unit removed from her home less than an hour after the incident.  

He is doing okay, even though we have frequent wound care appointments (these people are incredible!) and there could be possible scarring.  He is now having nightmares where he wakes up screaming ""hot"" or ""owwies"", but once he crawls into bed with his dad and me, he calms down somewhat.  The whole thing was a nightmare.  He is now open to baths again and his wounds are healing really well.  We talk about his owwies if he asks about them.  He also plays and giggles and is back to normal. :)

Please check the factory specs on your dispenser if you have a hot water option!  It could be a hidden danger.  

Thank you for sticking this post out with me.  I appreciate you ladies.

I figured there has to be at least one other Mom that's gone through something similar, which is why I'm posting here.

The past four days have been extremely difficult. On Thursday, I started spotting. I called my doctor, I had an appointment on Friday. She sent me to get some blood work done. Later that day, I heard back that the blood work was fine.

My husband woke me up on Friday to get ready for my appointment. He had my daughter and was making her breakfast. I went to the bathroom and immediately started crying. I was bleeding harder, almost period-like bleeding. I came out and told my husband, all he could think to do was hold me, and hug me. I took a shower to get ready for the appointment. We leave.

I get to the appointment, let the nurse know what's going on. My doctor comes in, quite honestly, I think it's the fastest I've ever been seen in a doctor's office. She tells me she's not going to do the exam that day, she didn't want to put me through it. Instead, she ordered an ultrasound. I found out I was 10 weeks pregnant. 10 weeks! How the time flew by. I knew before my period was even supposed to start that I was pregnant.

For Christmas, we gave my father, mother-in-law, and grandmother-in-law Christmas cards with a letter saying I was pregnant. I've never seen my dad react the way that he did. He started crying and gave me the biggest bear hug ever. He was thrilled. He was going to be a grandfather again! I was a little weary about letting everyone know so soon, considering I've had two miscarriages in the past. But, with the birth of my daughter, I had assumed we were over the past, no more miscarriages, this baby would be fine, healthy and happy, just like my daughter.

I go to the hospital to get the ultrasound done. I was excited. I had to pee extremely badly, but I was excited nonetheless. They called me back very quickly. The ultrasound technician begins, telling me ""you must really need to pee! Look how big your bladder is. I'm trying not to take too much time, don't worry"". I peek at the screen. She's taking pictures of something. It must be the baby. There's a black form on the screen. It was tiny compared to my bladder, but I just knew, it had to be my baby.

She told me to empty my bladder, she was going to have to do an internal. I felt so relieved after going to the bathroom. I saw my baby on the screen, so small, so very very small. I get back into the room and was instructed to disrobe from my waist down, get on the cot and cover myself with the sheet. I did as I was told. She comes back in, and we begin the internal. I couldn't see the screen this time. Something was nagging in the back of my head, telling me something was wrong, very very wrong. If I was 10 weeks, why would an internal be needed? If that was my baby, where was the heartbeat? I stared at the ceiling, hoping the nagging in my head would be put to rest soon.

The ultrasound tech told me to wait in the waiting room. She wasn't at liberty to speak of the ultrasound to me. She told me a doctor would be here to talk to me shortly. I was terrified. I went out and sat with my husband and told him we were waiting for a doctor to talk to us, we weren't allowed to leave until one talked to us.

An hour goes by, luckily there was a t.v. in the waiting room. I was hoping it wouldn't take much longer. I was exhausted, I missed my daughter, I was scared, and I was hungry. A few minutes later, the ultrasound technician comes back, and calls me over. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""The doctor is delivering a baby right now, and I had an emergency and had to be in the O.R."" ""It's fine,"" I told her. She was very apologetic, and assured me the doctor would be done soon.

My husband was getting very antsy. He was upset. Why was it taking so long? I was trying to reassure myself. Repeating the phrase ""good things come to those who wait, good things come to those who wait"" inside my head. That nagging came back ""if it was good news, why didn't you see the flicker of a heartbeat?"" I had to hope more was seen on the internal.

Finally, after nearly two hours in the waiting room, we were escorted into an exam room and told the doctor was on his way. I was anxious, my husband was anxious. The doctor came in. He introduced himself and told me he hated to be so blunt, but there was no other way he could be, given the circumstance. My baby had stopped growing two weeks prior. There was no heartbeat, I was having another miscarriage.

I tried to be strong, I tried to keep my brave face on, but it shattered. I shattered. I began to cry, one tear came down first, followed by a wave. The doctor was reassuring me that it was nothing I did or didn't do. It could have been the egg, or the sperm, we could try again, sometimes these things just happen. I completely lost my composure. He told me we could schedule a D&amp;C on Monday morning, they would probably have me in by the afternoon. That's if nothing happened over the weekend. I told him I wasn't sure if I wanted the D&amp;C, it was something we'd have to think over. He said he understood, and brought us back out into the waiting room.

My husband held me close as we walked to the exit. A family walked by and a little girl looked to her parents and said ""I saw a woman crying! Why was she crying?"" We walked out to the parking lot, and to the car. I haven't cried so much in a long, long time. We got home and had to tell everyone what was happening. Luckily, my daughter is only 14 months, she doesn't understand what happened.

Yesterday morning, I woke up in the worst pain. It felt like my insides were being turned inside out. I felt destroyed, like I lost a part of myself. I knew this pain, I've gone through it twice before. The first time, I was 15. My mom rushed me to the hospital. I had the miscarriage at the hospital. I felt, more than anything at that point, relieved. I wasn't going to be a mother before I was legally an adult. I could go on and be a stupid teenager. I was sadly, very happy.

The last time I went through this was a month after my wedding. We were so excited! I was unknowingly a week pregnant at the wedding. When we found out, we celebrated. How wonderful, getting married and having a baby within a year of each other. But alas, that wasn't in our cards. I was absolutely crushed. I began to worry that I couldn't carry a baby. But that February, I got pregnant again. This time, the baby was fine. I have a beautiful daughter as proof.

So when I got pregnant again, my husband and I figured naively, nothing would go wrong. When I realized I was at least 9 weeks pregnant, I thought we were so close to being in the clear, nothing could go wrong. I was taking care of myself, taking my prenatal every day, staying hydrated, eating balanced meals and snacks. We were going to be having another baby, the estimated due date was the day after our wedding anniversary. What a wonderful anniversary present.

I had to call my boss and let her know what was going on. Luckily, my boss is awesome. She told me she would get my shifts covered for as long as I needed, and to let her know what was going on.

Two hours later, after the terrible pain I was going through, I had to say good-bye to the baby. It was gone. There was nothing I could do. Where do I go from here? I wanted to just lay down and cry for the day. But I couldn't, I had to be strong for my daughter. She needs me.

So now, a day after and I'm doing absolutely terrible. My husband had to go to work. He's not doing well. He thought he was fine until he was around other people. Today, I played with my daughter, I cleaned up the house. I've tried to do everything I can to keep my mind occupied, but I just can't. I broke down into tears in the middle of playing, I was barely focused on cleaning, and now looking at the kitchen, it shows. My daughter is now napping. She's not running around, getting into trouble, keeping my mind occupied. She's not awake to put a smile on my face when she gets into trouble, or does something silly.

All I can think about is how easily set off I am. Even things not related to babies are setting me off. How am I going to be able to go into work and be ""normal"" when my world seems to be shattering? I'm having a hard time talking to anyone but my husband. No one around me has gone through a miscarriage. No one I know quite understands that loss, or how I feel like an empty shell. Or, maybe a robot. I have to go through the motions of being normal for my daughter. She knows something is wrong, but I can't help but try to shield her from my pain. She should be happy and care-free.

I would love nothing more than to have another baby. I love the joy and laughter my daughter brings, but our family feels ""incomplete"". It's nothing against my daughter, I just always imagined having at least two kids. But my husband and I have talked about it. This is the second time he's seen my heart wrenched from me, the second time he's seen my world collapse from around me. He doesn't want to see a third time. How can we even chance having this happen again? I don't think I'm strong enough to go through it again. The excitement of finding out we're going to have a baby, only to have it yanked away from us a few weeks later, leaving me more incomplete than before. I feel like I've lost a huge part of myself. I don't think that void was ever filled from the last miscarriage, and quite honestly, it feels as if that hole turned into a crater. How am I supposed to get past this? I feel like a complete failure, like I'm somehow less of a woman.

Thank you for letting me get this out. And if you actually read it, I'm sorry if any of it didn't make sense. I really just needed to vent.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_p1pod,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/p1pod/having_a_hard_time_coping/,

She was running a fever last monday and after some tests it came back that she had a bacterial infection in her blood. We went to the hospital last wednesday - at which point they ran a litany of tests on her to verify (including a spinal tap). 

They finally determined that she had a UTI which went to the bladder and then to the blood - none of which could have been prevented. I have asked 4 separate doctors...all of which said we did everything right and it was just the combination of the bacteria and my daughter's body that lead to such an extreme case of infection.

I have now had to hold my daughter while she cried and screamed during the following procedures:

* Placing an IV (successfully - twice, unsuccessfully - nine times)

* Drawing blood (successfully - twice, unsuccessfully - three times)

* Intramuscular shot of antibiotics (because they blew all her veins on those 9 unsuccessful placements)

* Placement of a catheter (successfully twice, unsuccessfully - four times)

* X-Rays

* Bladder/Kidney Imaging (VCUG)  (after having not been able to eat for 7 hours)

* Ultrasound of Bladder/Kidneys 


Each unsuccessful event was 10x as difficult to deal with as the successful events.

We are going home today after 8 days; 7 days of antibiotics by IV.

Needless to say : **Vaccinations?!?** *Bring 'em on.*

The whole thing was really weird, the lady that ran it seemed really authoritarian, and sort of yelled at me for not keeping up with all the little dances and songs. Really overwhelming! Also, turns out every kid in the world can clap except mine! To make matters worse, we were 5 minutes late, and in our rush to get out the door I didn't do my hair, and just threw on a hoodie.

I don't want to change another diaper, wake up from a nice sleep only to have to struggle to breast feed. Why on earth we decided to have another baby is now beyond me. She was so good at first, now she is a pain. I just want to sleep. I want to be able to pick up my first born (c section not allowed to lift him) I want to stop grasping at straws and crying about everything. I am just doing this now because I am supposed to take care of this squirming larva. Plus the family (who do not have to be up with her every 3 hours only to have her fail at breast feeding and pooping in the diaper I had just put on her) seems to like her and probably wouldn't like it if I gave her away. To clarify as well I would not hurt her in any way. I don't want to feel this way but I do. Had to vent. Maybe someone knows this feeling too. 

Edit: these feelings happen at night usually. And while many things can set me off crying during the day it is short lived and doesn't prevent me from caring for myself and children. I talked to the doctor today she says at this point it sounds like normal baby blues. If it prevents me from getting out of bed. Wanting to go out of the house or if my moods become worse to let her know. I felt pretty much te same with my first and it passed once sleep was reintroduced to my brains. As for naps for some reason I have always had an aversion to naps. Especially now with a toddler running amok. I have often tried to nap. It just cannot happen.

My wife had to make an emergency last minute trip, leaving me with my daughter for 6 days.  She took a breast pump, as we weren't planning to wean or daughter for another few months, and my wife hadn't done anything to prepare the weaning process (and isn't emotionally ready).  Our daughter just turned a year old, if that's relevant.

She's been texting me - she doesn't have internet access where she is - and saying that she's getting almost no milk from pumping, 0.2 oz after 20 minutes and counting today, and 1 oz yesterday after nearly an hour of pumping.  She says she can feel the milk in there, but it's just not coming out.  She's worried about mastitis and being engorged, but more worried about losing her milk.  She left Wednesday and is back on Tuesday night.

Does anyone have any advice?  She's really upset, missing her daughter and me, and generally, anything I can say, do or suggest to make her feel better would be awesome.

Thanks!

I teach violin out of my home, and I had planned to hire the 2 oldest children from one of the families I teach to work as mother's helpers for me- to take care of my daughter while I teach. However, I just found out that the family doesn't vaccinate their children. 

My initial response is that I don't want to have them in close contact with my daughter due to this- but is that good science? They're not vaccinated, does having them in contact with my daughter put her at greater risk? I'm having trouble thinking my way through it. She'll only be 3 months old, so she won't have had a full course of vaccines yet anyway.

I'm doing googling now, but I'd appreciate any insight any of you have into this.

So I've spent the past few years under the (apparently mistaken) impression that I would not be able to get pregnant again. I have a variety of issues with my ladyparts which, at this point don't really matter because I am now 5 weeks pregnant. I have an appointment with an OB November 9th. My husband has already offered to have a vasectomy. He and my daughter want another baby. I was on the fence (pregnancy was difficult for me), but since I didn't think it was possible, I had pretty much accepted that and was ready to move on with my career and focus on our family of three being happy, healthy, and probably traveling a lot.

There are multiple other situations complicating my feelings about this pregnancy. One is that I have miscarried at least a couple of times since having my daughter over three years ago, so of course I worry about that. But I did not miss a period by much in the past. A pregnancy that I lost in January was confirmed through a biopsy I had a few months ago. I kind of ""felt"" that I was pregnant, but had not gotten a positive pregnancy test.

Second is that I'm currently finishing graduate school. I would graduate in the beginning of June, and my due date would be June 30th. My plan was to adjunct at a couple of colleges while I worked my way into a full-time faculty position. With those benefits, my husband could go back to school and get his master's degree. I don't know what the possibility of that is now, because someone will need to be with the baby once it's born (assuming all goes well), and at this point, we can't afford for either of us to stay home. 

Our three-year-old daughter is in preschool right now while I complete teaching internships and we can't afford it. We're broke, broke, broke. Robbing Peter to pay Paul and all that jazz. We don't qualify for assistance because my internship and level of education are not considering ""necessary."" 
We live in a big, expensive city with progressive people. Our family lives in a small, affordable city with conservative values. I like raising my daughter in a place with so many opportunities and such great public transportation. If we moved back ""home"" for help from family (and for our dollars to stretch farther), I would feel like we're giving up quite a bit on culture and opportunities for everyone. But we know no one here. All my schoolmates are ten years younger than me, single, no kids. 

So, another thing I worry about is applying for ""real"" jobs (in either city) when I'm obviously pregnant and then getting turned down as a result. I'm also concerned about the upcoming holidays. I am very, very short and, as with my last pregnancy, am beginning to show already. There's no way I'll be able to hide it when I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I'm not sure I will be able to keep it under wraps before the first trimester is over. 

I keep saying ""if all goes well,"" because, you know, I'm 37 years old, so to add another layer to my quiet panic is the potential that something could come up in tests. 

God. I am kind of a mess right now. Sorry about all of this. I guess I'm just asking for general advice, suggestions, good vibes, whatever anyone wants to share. I'm scared and worried. Thanks, ladies.

Then I suddenly remembered the most pleasant thing and probably my very favorite part (aside from my new baby of course) about my time in the hospital and it was those freaking cold pads. I was so upset when they started giving me the warming ones. The cold ones felt so good!

Well jax was born via csection and I am now able to do most things normally but I just can't catch a break. House never stays clean enough so it seems like I never clean. I can never catch up on laundry cuz hubby leave the cloths outside( I wash/dry/put away, he brings it out and in). Boo is all over the place. 

Now jax is so gassy/colic/crying all time I just don't know what to do anymore. Hubby loves the kids but isn't as hands on as I would like. And I have no family around enough to help and friend.... ha! Ya none there either. And since I'm breastfeeding I'm attached to jax all the time. And I'm trying to wean off of using the shield too.

I had a small depression because I couldn't, and that got me thinking.. why does society make formula feeding seem like you're feeding blended McDonalds to your infant?

Her sister is awesome at making things. She's SUPER crafty. She's made Jude (my almost 3 year old) plenty of things.
Well, for some GOD DAMN FUCKIN' REASON, my MIL went and told her sister that we were FOR SURE naming the new baby ""Oliver"". So, her sister went and embroidered all the things she made for him with the fucking initials ""O.J."" (Our last name is Johnson)

So, not only does it have initials we probably aren't going to use, it's also ""O.J."" as in O.J. Simpson. I know, call me crazy. Also- MIL says ""Well if you name him Darwin (another name we were liking) you can easily change it."" The fuck I can! And what if I don't name him that? What if his first name is Nigel? How do you change that O to an N? (No, his name isn't really going to be Nigel, but you get my point).

I love her sisters blankets and stuff, and now I'm all pissed off because it's got the wrong initials on it. A hand-made blanket and it doesn't have the right initials all because my MIL is a stupid bitch who decided to tell everyone his name is fucking Oliver.

It's like SHE wants the baby named Oliver, so she is telling everyone that his name is such. Her doing this shit is driving me crazy. I have stopped telling her names, because she keeps telling everyone and everyone is making it concrete! What the SHIT.

Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts, 
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, 
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, 
but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

You are the bows from which your children
as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, 
and He bends you with His might 
that His arrows may go swift and far.

She's almost three. She's never slept through the night since she was born. She wouldn't go to sleep on her own, she had to be held. She fought it every night, she fought every nap. I tried the ""cry it out"" method and the ferber method but she would cry so hard she would make herself sick. I've done all the things the way you're supposed to in every book or online article I've ever read and nothing works. 

Now that she's old enough and in this defiant ""no!"" stage the entire night time routine is somewhat of a living hell. i hate to say that. i know she doesn't understand how tired i am, i know she isn't maliciously doing this just to make me miserable. But i can't help but get so frustrated with her at nights. I'm so freaking tired and I can't help but think about how selfish and disrespectful she is being by refusing to just lay down and go the eff to sleep! And I feel even worse for feeling that way. :( 

We've had the same routine since she was just a few months old: bath time, quiet/cuddle time, bed time. We start the bath at 8. She realizes what is going on and she comes up with every excuse she can to get out of it: says she's hungry, or thirsty, has to go potty 12 times (and doesn't actually go), needs a blankie or a stuffed animal (or 19 of them) to cuddle with, wants to watch something else, or read a different book, or whatever she can to get up again. This goes on for 4-5 hours. I often deny everything except the potty trips. We don't end up actually sleeping until 12 or 1 AM. Sometimes she's stayed up till 2. I have to get up at 6:45 but I am late every single morning because I'm so f*cking exhausted and it's so hard to get out of bed. 

I was never one who believed that you should put a tv in a kids room but I figured I would try it because maybe she would fall asleep watching a movie and then I could go to sleep. But it doesn't work, she stays up watching the movie (if she will even stay in her room) and then wants another movie. There is a fan in there for white noise that has always been in there. I have tried turning everything off, I've tried just leaving the fan on with the TV off and a night light (she's afraid of the dark) and it doesn't seem to matter. She will NOT just lay down and go to sleep. 

I don't understand these people I know whose kids go to bed at 8 or 8:30 and sleep through the night, but I kinda hate them for it. It's so unfair. I've never been able to get her to do this and I feel like I am going to lose my mind here soon if she doesn't start going to bed at a decent hour. 

My husband can't really help cuz he has to get up at 4am to go to work. So I have to deal with this by myself and then I have to get up and get her ready to go in the morning alone too. Not only am I exhausted but I never have time to myself either. I know thats a horrible thing to say because you're supposed to devote yourself to your kids and give them 100% of your time but on the other hand, I feel like if I don't get some time to relax I am just going to continue being frustrated and exhausted and miserable all the time and how is that any better parenting?? 

Her Dr acts like some kids are just like this and there isn't anything I can do but deal with it. I don't know what to do about it either. I don't want to feel resentful toward her, she's such a sweet little girl, I know she's not doing it on purpose, but at the same time I just want to sleep. :( 

****edit**** Update: we tried the supernanny thing last night, i dont even know how many times i had to put her back in bed, maybe 50? it was nonstop. had to shut the door on her a few times and listen to her cry :(. I would open it after a few minutes though and try putting her back in bed several more times before shutting the door again and repeating the whole process. But she would NOT stay in bed so i didn't know how else to get the point across that she needed to stay in bed. One hour and a half and one pair of peed pants later and she was asleep by 10:15. i got to sleep by 11. was on time for work and didn't wake up with splitting headache :D. she did end up getting up in the middle of the night and crawling into bed with us at some point, but i still consider this somewhat of a success. I'm going to keep trying it and will let you guys know how it goes after 10 days or so. THANK YOU everyone for all of your input, advice, suggestions, empathy, everything, i can't tell you how grateful I am! Thanks again!!

So I have a 3 year old boy, and I feel like all I do is yell at him! Then I get frustrated and even the little things get to me way more than they should. Time to get dressed? its a battle, time to put your shoes on? its a battle, Time to eat? its a battle, literally everything is a battle. Some days I feel like I can't do it anymore! I try giving him notice like ""I know you're watching nemo right now, when it's over we have to get in the bath"" and he said ""okay"" but when it comes time it's a huge battle of him yelling ""NO"" then crying, etc. In the morning before work I give him a 15 minute warning ""We need to get our shoes and coats on in 15 minutes"" and he says ""okay"" then when it's time it's a huge battle. Then I end up getting frustrated and yelling. I feel like all I do is yell! I feel like we're not even enjoying our time together bc it's constant fighting and I want to enjoy our time together. Does anyone have any suggestions?

A littel extra info that might help, his father isn't in the picture so I can't get out for a while and leave him home. I live with my parents right now (that's hopefully changing in the next 6 months) and they ""help"" but it's only if I want to go out after he is in bed. I've tried getting away and having my mom watch him for a few hours but when I get back all I get is crap from her about how bad he was, etc. So I don't know what else do to at this point. ANY help is appreciated!!! 

Edit: I've gotten so much good advice here! Thank so all so much for your kind words and for not making me feel like a failure! I was really nervous to post this because I didn't want people to be rude and make me feel worse than I already did, but you ladies gave me so many good ideas!

I am hoping to get some advice from other moms, and hopefully I can avoid having a complete nervous breakdown. 

I am 29, married, with two little girls, almost 4 and 20 months.  I am a stay at home mom, so for the most part I take care of the day to day chores.  Cooking, cleaning, laundry, pick up at school, grocery shopping, laundry, etc.  I know I'm fortunate to stay home, and I'd never give that up-and I appreciate everything my husband does for me and my girls. He works hard, sometimes late nights and weekends, to provide for us.  He's salary, so no overtime for these extra hours, but we appreciate what he does.   

This year I started teaching dance classes twice a week (Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings).  Those two days DH is in charge of the girls, although Saturdays my 4 year old comes with me, as her class is one I teach. 

So--to the topic at hand.  I was at class last night...I come home---WAYYYY past everyone's bedtime, to find my 4 year old wide awake, my 20 month old and my DH sleeping on the couch, and cartoons blaring.  When I went to move my 20 month old, she was COVERED in poop.  Like it leaked through the diaper, through her pj's onto the couch.  Of course I had to change her, which of course woke her up, and I had to put her to bed.  I know he works all day, but WHY can't he just do what he's supposed to do.  This happens constantly.  He doesn't help me at all, he leaves EVERYTHING for me to do, and he sleeps when he's supposed to be watching our children.  My 20 month old is in no way, shape, or form the kind of kid you can leave unattended to play and amuse herself.  Her favorite activities include climbing on the table and the counters, and playing in the toilet.  I watch her like a hawk--I don't follow her around all day, but if she's being too quiet while I'm cleaning or something, I go investigate.  He cannot do that if he's sleeping. 

I try to calmly and rationally explain to him how I feel when I come home to my kids bouncing off the walls, or him sleeping, and he just gets annoyed with me and tells me I'm being a bitch, he fell asleep, what do I want from him?  I want you to watch your children!  I want you to follow the bedtime routine that we--together--started with our kids since they were born.  I'm not asking you to clean, cook, etc.  I'm asking you take care of our children. 

Thanks in advance for listening, and for any words of wisdom you have for me.

Finally, we went to a new pediatrician and she suggested Calmoseptine.  She said that one of her nurses suggested it because she used to work in hospice, and they would use it on the patients who would get rashes from being unable to get out of bed.

It's affordable and works fast (his diaper rashes are usually 100% cleared up in 2-3 applications), and you can get it at your local Walgreens.

Not by my choice.
We decided to start weaning from the day feedings last week; he was getting too frustrated with my lack of milk and my supply was dropping anyways. The plan was to continue breastfeeding for the morning and bedtime feedings; he is usually relaxed for those. However, my supply dropped completely, even for the morning and bedtime feedings.

This morning was my last feeding. He's fine with it; he knows he gets more from the bottle so he hasn't really been wanting the breast for awhile.

It's just breaking my heart. I was planning on breastfeeding for a year; exclusively for 6 months. It was hard enough to add formula (which quickly became his main source of calories) at 1 month, and now we're done completely.

It's so frustrating, I feel like I've failed as a Mama, even with EVERYTHING we did (which was quite a lot) to get my supply up. Everyone keeps telling me ""oh, you've done so well, most moms would have given up by now."" Well, that doesn't help me, because I'm not most moms, I'm the mama of MY little boy and he NEEDS me and I feel like I have failed him. Yes, he gets the calories he needs, and he is healthy and happy, but it's killing me that I no longer have the option of breastfeeding.

I don't really have a question or anything... just needed to vent a little.


EDIT: Wow, Mommit, thank you all for the comments. We were actually able to feed for about 5 minutes on one breast (didn't even attempt the other; it doesn't make anything anyways) this morning, so I am letting myself hope that the morning feedings may continue. (When most feedings last &lt;1 min per breast.... 5 minutes seems like an hour.) I'm taking it day by day though, and trying to accept the fact that each feeding may be the last. It's probably only going to work if he's still half-asleep, but I'll try!

I laughed and/or cried through most of your comments. Thank you so much; it's nice to hear from so many who have had similar problems...  and to have my butt handed to me by some of you too.

I have an 8 month old girl who's had issues with eczema since she was about 5 months. I'm a young, first time mom( I'm 20 and my husband's 21) so I will admit I was very overwhelmed when she broke out head to toe and wouldn't get better. I tried taking care of it at home for about a week before I took my baby to the doctor and I feel awful for it. 

Two days ago my husband got a call from child protective services saying that someone reported my daughter being abused and we had to go in for an interview. I freaked out thinking of every little thing I've done wrong since she was born trying to think if there was anything that would get my baby girl taken away from me. I was so scared that I almost threw up on the way there today.

Once we get there the worker explains that the complaint said I was negligent with my daughter. She then told me that the person said

1). My daughter didn't have a crib 

2). Had a severe diaper rash that I wasn't taking care of.

3). Had scratches all over because I wasn't taking care of her eczema.

4). The outside of our house was dirty and cluttered.

As soon as she said this I knew it was my grandmother who called. I know she called just to make it harder on me and my husband because she basically lied about everything. She was the one who gave us a crib, she had seen the rash and known that it had been gone for months, she saw her a week before with a little scratch that was healed in 2 days, and the house that we are staying at doesn't have grass so we park the cars inside the gated area(which the worker said didn't even matter because It's not like we live in the front yard). 

I'm just so hurt that my own grandma would do this to me. She's called me a bad mother more than once which has caused me to stay very distant from her but this makes me want to just cut her out of my and my baby's lives. She's made up things(like my husband being an alcoholic) in the past that I could forgive and forget but this time she's trying to get my daughter taken away from me.

I've tried everything in my power to help her lose the weight but she doesn't seem to be getting any smaller. 
Some back story. When she was born she was only 6'7 which I'm told is on the small side. She had a few months where she would only fall asleep if I was in the bed with her feeding her a bottle and it usually took a few small bottles to get her to sleep. I indulged her because I was sleep deprived myself and had a pretty severe case of the baby blues. I'm fully aware that wasn't the right thing to do but hindsight is always 20/20. I stopped over feeding her as soon as I realized how bad it got. 
We've had genetic tests, thyroid tests and such and everything was negative. I've tried feeding her less, feeding her 3 medium sized meals a day with no snacks, feeding her 6 small meals a day, feeding her 3 meals that always followed a pattern (fruit for breakfast, fruit and veggie for lunch, protein and veggie for dinner) and more other ways than I can list. She only drinks skim milk, crystal light, or water. Everything she eats is low fat, fat free, sugar free, or low calorie (though we occasionally give her a piece of chocolate or cookie when she's had a bad day). She plays outside every day and does physical therapy for something unrelated so she gets plenty of exercise. I'm out of ideas and I'm worried for my daughters health.

We have a 2 year old girl and I think my husband's internet usage isn't normal. He is on his ipad from the minute he wakes up to the minute he goes to bed and during the day he sits on the couch on his ipad. It's really frustrating because our time with our girl is so limited because we both work and he chooses to be on the internet. 

Although he doesn't totally ignore our daughter, he will play with her for 5 to 10 minutes at a time before he has to get back on his ipad. It would be different if it was for work but he's usually playing games or browsing forums. Even when she wants to read, he'll read to her while on his ipad. I no longer feel comfortable even leaving the room because every time I do, he just lets her go all over the house while he's on his ipad. I've found her playing in the toilet, turning on the water in the tub, playing in the fridge, chewing on electrical cords and when I come back into the room, he's like I don't know where she went...

It's really frustrating because I want him to have a strong relationship with his daughter but it seems like he just doesn't have time or doesn't really care. She really clings to me and I know it really bothers him and I just think if he were capable of just putting down the ipad and hang out with her and give her his undivided attention for more than a few minutes than she would feel more comfortable around him. 

While he is browsing the internet, I'm trying to get the house cleaned, do the laundry and get food on the table and he just doesn't seem to even want to help, even when I ask, I get an eyeroll or he doesn't hear me because he isn't paying any attention. I feel really taken advantage of.

I've brought this up before and he blames me because I'm doing stuff and he's bored or I don't pay any attention to him but when I try, he'll still be on the internet. Like we can't even watch a movie or a tv show without him on the internet. When I've gotten really upset, he'll stop for a day or two and then go right back to the way it was before.

I'm really at my breaking point and I just don't know what to do anymore. I really feel like a single mom. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this post but I really need to get it out somewhere.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_13vpj5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/13vpj5/husband_is_addicted_to_the_internet/,

I just don’t understand him at all. He has always smoked, I knew this when I met him.  He encouraged me to smoke and I did for about five years. When we decided to try for a baby we agreed together to stop smoking and with difficulty I stopped. He said that it was harder for him because he had been smoking for longer. I said ok just do your best.  I became pregnant. He smoked all throughout the pregnancy (outside) and would even offer me cigarettes. I declined obviously.      
    He then stopped for about four months. When he restarted I was disappointed in him but resigned to the fact that it was his life. I was breastfeeding our son but he continuously offered me cigarettes to try and get me to resume smoking. I totally accept that it is pointless to nag/ask him to stop. He gets very angry and snappy with me if I dare mention it.  
Now here is the problem – He has no life insurance. He has been smoking 20+ a day for about 20 years and REFUSES to get life insurance. I have begged him to get insurance. I am terrified that he will get cancer and leave my 19 month old son and I with no money.  
    This may sound selfish but I do not want to raise my child alone and in poverty, especially not in poverty. We do not live on the bread line and he could afford life insurance. I myself have a sizable policy should the worst happen to me. I tried to take out a policy for my husband but they needed the name of his doctor. He has no doctor. 
     I think you know where I am going with this. He refuses to register with a doctor and will not give me his NHS number so I have no way of signing him up. We live in England so it is not as if it will cost him anything to sign up. Last week he insinuated that if he had insurance I would have him “bumped off”. 
    I’m fed up. Not only does he smell like an ash tray, cough all the time and leave piles of tobacco around the house he refuses to protect our sons future. What can I do? Is there any way I can insure him without access to his medical information??

Because I don't believe in abortions and this would be his first (he's 39) we decided to go ahead and keep it and make plans to raise it together. We met with a family lawyer and talked about joint custody. We've even been looking at houses together (not exactly to move in to together, but definitely something more appropriate).

With her being around more and her friends starting unnecessary drama, things this last week or two have been really rocky. He showed up so late to one of my appt, he literally missed it and didn't even bother to show up to the last one. 

He came over to my house last night (father's day) because I had got him a gift for the holiday a few weeks ago. Basically told me that we can't be friends any longer, and that he probably wouldn't be talking to me until after the baby is born.

Trent (himself) save money, poo in toilet, buy new fwabob (spongebob) game. walmart"" Meaning ""If I poo in the toilet, I'll get money for a new spongebob game"". 
My parents, for the last year or so INSIST that he is autistic because of his anti-social behaviors. He is content playing by himself, but still plays with others. He is *painfully* shy, so he doesn't talk a lot when we are visiting, and is scared of getting in trouble, so doesn't say when something bothers him, like his cousin, who my parents have custody of, takes a toy from him.
They have told my sister, who lives out of town, ""Trent is autistic, but Chowderhead1 just doesn't want to admit it"". 
My brother is severely autistic, so they feel that because ""they have seen autism"", they are able to diagnose. To try and shut them up, I talked to my doctor. She kind of tested his cognition by pointing to his foot and saying ""hey whats that on your hand?"" he'd point to his had, confused, and say ""no, that foot. this hand"" She isn't concerned. Neither am I. Boys are often speech delayed, as are second children, which he is. I have tried to tell them that I appreciate their concern, thank you for bringing it up, but he acts completely different when he is in the comfort of his own home, and not being shy.

That being said, toward the end of the year, a new little boy (who happens to be in my son's class) moved here. 

From day 1 my kids integrated ""Tommy"" into their rotation without any coaching from myself, or any other moms. Recently, Tommy has started cutting to the front of the line, effectively being the first one on every day. 

Last week while my kids were waiting at the stop sign, when Tommy cut in front again (requiring him to step off the curb into the street), I said, ""Tommy, you went first yesterday, so today it's Elle's turn."" 

To which Tommy's mother replies, ""My son isn't part of the ""charade"" of ""I'm going first, no I'm first"" bullshit (yes, in front of the kids)"" and proceeded to physically grab his arm and drag him toward the bus that hadn't even stopped yet. 

Once the kids were safely out of ear shot, I said, ""If you're trying to demonstrate that it's not an issue what order the kids get on, why not make him get on last?"" She had no answer other than, ""Because it's not a big deal!""

I'm very frustrated because I've seen how she talks and disciplines him: grabbing him by the ear from a sitting position and LIFTING him up by it, she belittles him and tries to reason with him like he's a teenager. While I'm certainly not one to tell someone how to raise their kids, it's difficult for me to watch her essentially telling Tommy that he doesn't have to wait his turn like everyone else, like that she's teaching him that the rules of common courtesy or social order don't apply to him. IDK. It's like she's raising that asshole who cuts you in line at the store, and I'm just venting. 

Buuuut I still have to share a bus stop with her every day (yes, 2 more weeks THIS year, but what about next?).

(I can provide more details backing up my claim that her poor way of delivering messages to him is going to be damaging to his psyche if anyone is curious.)

My question is: When she allows her son to cut in front of the 2 kids waiting patiently, what do I do? I don't want my kids thinking it's ok for people to walk all over them.

TL;DR: Mom at the bus stop thinks her son is above waiting his turn and I'm not sure how to teach my kids to deal with assholes who think they can take whatever they want.

UPDATE: When it was time to get on the bus again today, Tommy waited until Matt started getting on the bus, then put out his arm in an attempt to block and cut Elle, saying ""it doesn't matter, crybaby!"". What NOW? 




edit: Added details and (attempted) punctuation.



UPDATE: After reading your suggestions, I talked to my kids about this and gave them the options of going to the other bus stop or (because they're always super early) letting Tommy get on first because he was there first. They jumped at the opportunity to go to another stop. Clearly, my kids don't want to deal with this crap, either. 
The Resource officer called me back, and while he listened to me, I'm not sure there was much he could do besides going to their house. I don't think they'd find anything to make it worth going by and inciting retaliation. We don't live in the best of neighborhoods, and sad as it is, I can see her and her little ""hood rat"" friends slashing my tires or something. :(

I've worked in a preschool, kindergarten and home daycare. I currently work in a non state funded daycare center and nanny for two families, one with a special needs child. I want to give you an inside view of what goes on in a daycare, and give you some tips when looking for one for your child.
First off, most of us went into this career because we care about children. It isn't glamorous and it doesn't provide a lot of money. It's pretty easy to tell the difference between someone doing it for money and someone doing it for love. We love your children. We want them to be safe and happy, and if we run or work in a quality center, we want to teach them too.
Do not put your child in a center that isn't educational. This isn't babysitting, and your child shouldn't be in front of a TV all day. As you probably all know, education starts at birth. A child's most important years are birth to three. So first off, make sure the center is educational. 


Other things to make sure of:
Is there a routine and schedule posted (preferably in a way children can understand)?

Do children have chances to develop math, science, literacy, gross and fine motor skills?

Are nutritious meals and outdoor time provided?

Does the center have a comprehensive parent handbook that outlines their policies?

Is the classroom multicultural? Do the staff get to know the families and children individually?

Is the staff/child ratio acceptable? Where I live, for example, it is 4 infants to one teacher. You never want to see that over.

Do children, especially young children, have a primary teacher/caregiver, and a consistent sub?

Is everything sanitary? No obviously old and dirty toys or furniture, staff wash hands in between diaper changings, etc.

Are they licensed? Please don't put your child in a center that isn't licensed. Also, you can check online (DHS in my state) to see if the center has had any issues.

Do the staff call the children by their names, do they get on the floor and interact with them?

Is there a discipline policy you agree with?

Are you welcome to stop in any time? Make sure you do!

Are there sufficient toys and materials? Can children reach them? Are they labeled?

Is there a quiet spot for children to go when they are overwhelmed and need to rest?

Also ask the lead teacher or administrator what education the staff have. You want people with degrees, or at least CDAs, caring for your children. Centers hire highschoolers because it is cheaper. Volunteers are great, but actual employees should have background and education regarding child development.
Do they send out a newsletter?

Some other things to consider:
Child care workers are here to help you! If you need resources, ask us. We are in contact with pediatricians, the health department, early intervention services, therapists, etc.

Non state funded daycares are not required to take children with special needs. They are probably not equipped for it. You'd be better off taking a child with special needs to some place like Head Start, where they will get the care they need.

We are trying to help your child. Please work with us when for toilet training and disciplining. You have to be on board with us, and we have to be on board with you. Otherwise, children get confused.

Parents are often the problem. It doesn't do your child any favors if you aren't disciplining him or her.

Home and family daycares are a great option! If there is one adult working in their home with children, they can have six children, including their own. If there are two adults, there can be twelve. I personally love this atmosphere, it is very family like. Just do your research. Talk to other parents, make sure they're licensed, check online to make sure they haven't had issues.


Now, if you have checked out a daycare and you feel good about it, work with the providers. Like I said, we care. Of course, we don't like every child. That's often a lack of discipline problem at home (children need rules, structure, consequences and discipline. You won't be helping them by not doing these things). But we take great care of every child and want to teach them. Some children we genuinely love, especially if they come in as infants. Sometimes we do silly things (I have gone to the bathroom with a baby on my lap because she was sick and I didn't want to put her down). We are people too. Please try to be on time, let us know what's going on at home, respect us, trust us, be interested in what's going on in class, pay on time. You are the parents, the most important people to your child. But caregivers are also very important to them, especially if children are there a lot of the time. Your child needs to bond with us too. If you've picked a quality place, we know what we're doing :)

Please feel free to ask questions! Toilet training, teething, discipline strategies, how to pick a good babysitter, anything! I'm here to help.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_1c0qjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1c0qjc/daycare_professional_with_lots_of_information/,

It's like a part of me rears up and has irrational responses to her on days like today. I know it is terrible of me to get so mad at her for being fussy (I would never hurt her or anything! I just feel mad and/or weepy about it) but I can't help it.

1345309860.0,27,self.Mommit,yfn5o,Drowning,throwawaymamacita,36,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/yfn5o/drowning/,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text. I need to get all this off my chest. 

I feel like I am drowning in my life right now. Every morning when I wake up, and every night before I go to sleep, I am trying to think of a way out, and I come up with nothing. I feel like a caged animal. 

My little boy is 8 months old now and growing fast. I love him dearly but we have our struggles, mostly centered around sleep right now. I am still co-sleeping with him for at least part of the night, because I am too weak at 2 a.m. to get him back down in his crib and I just give up and bring him into bed with me. 

Because of this, my boyfriend has not slept in our bed since we came home from the hospital. He does not agree with my decision to co-sleep. 

We have not had sex or anything even remotely close since before the baby was born. Part of this is logistical - the baby's room is right next to our room with just a half-wall separating them so there is really no privacy. And, not to be blunt, but we don't really have any other furniture that's conducive to sexytimes. It's always been the bed or nothing. 

I am up to my ears at work with stress and being busy. Things were bad before I had the kid, but for a variety of reasons they have gotten way worse. I have been asked to put in a lot of overtime and work evenings and weekends, which has put a huge stress on my relationship with my boyfriend. He is angry that I'm being asked to work so much when we have a little baby at home, and even though he says he's not mad at me, I still feel his anger and it makes me feel helpless.

If I quit my job, we will all lose our health insurance and I wont' be able to make my mortgage payments. I don't think I could easily sell, or even rent, my house because we're in the middle of renovations. 

Oh yeah, renovations. So I don't have working kitchen right now (hot plate and microwave, no dishwasher) so we are eating lots of convenience foods, which means spending way more money than I am used to on groceries, and also I do not feel like it's helping me eat healthy and lose the baby weight that I am still carrying around. Which makes me feel like crap physically. 

My relationship with my boyfriend has degenerated to the point where we barely speak. At this point I don't even really know what's going on. I don't know if we're both just exhausted and stressed out, or if one day he is just going to come home and say, ""I can't do this anymore"" and leave us. That is my biggest fear. 

I am as guilty as he is. When I get home from work, I feel totally drained, like I have nothing left to give the men that I love (my little boy and my lover). It is all I can do to put a smile on my face, but even when I do, I feel like my BF does not even notice or care. 

We do not have any friends. I am friendly with a few people at work, but  have never socialized with them outside the office. It feels like they live in a different world from me. Even if I did want to get together with someone, it feels like it would be impossible. My BF does not want to have anyone over while we're in the middle of these renovations, because our house is a wreck. And I can't really see taking our baby out to a restaurant with us. 

My BF's mom has offered to baby-sit, and has watched our little guy a few times, but she goes to bed really early and really cannot watch the baby at night. I really don't know anyone else who I could ask to baby sit. 

We're falling behind financially. My BF is also working a lot of hours to try to make up the difference, but I look at what's coming in and what's going out and it is not adding up. Fortunately we have money saved up, so right now paying all our bills is not a problem. But the situation is not sustainable and I don't know what to do about it when we are both already working our asses off. I have been looking for a different job but no luck so far. My boy loves his day care, but it's expensive. The thought of having to pull him out of there because we can't afford it just makes me want to cry. 

I know I should talk to my BF about all this, but I am so tired of trying to start conversations like this and just getting shut down. 'i cannot show him what I have written here without hi being deeply offended that I posted this here (he is a Redditor and this is a throwaway account). Every night when I go to put the baby down for bed, I think, tonight is going to be the night that we are going to talk this out. And then I go downstairs and he will say something to me that makes me feel like everything's fine and it's the way things used to be. And I wuss out and don't say anything. And another day goes by. 

I keep asking myself if this is depression. But I honestly don't think it is. I do not think I would feel this way if there was just some part of my life right now that did not make me feel sick to my stomach to think about. 

TL;DR: I feel like everything in my life sucks and I don't know what to do. ",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_yfn5o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/yfn5o/drowning/,

1340685207.0,29,self.Mommit,vm3o3,Considering breaking up with a friend over parenting differences...,cochineal,43,14,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/vm3o3/considering_breaking_up_with_a_friend_over/,"TL;DR: From my point of view, a very good friend is doing her autistic daughter a disservice by not putting her in therapy and ""medicating"" her with homeopathy and TV.  My husband doesn't want to see their family any more because her daughter is out of control.  She also is obsessed with crusading against vaccines and it makes me angry.  I still love her, though, and don't want to judge her for her parenting choices.  :(

I don't really know what I'm looking for here, maybe some validation, maybe just to vent...  Every few months I decide that I don't want to be friends with my best friend, R, anymore, but I love her like a sister and when we spend time together we have so much fun.  Her daughter is 6 months older than my son, and they get along fairly well.  The issues I have are with how she parents.  Her daughter, A, was diagnosed with autism at around 18 months.  I don't know the details, but I do know it was serious enough that they were approved for speech, occupational and physical therapy several times a week.  However, after a few months, R decided she didn't like the type of therapy A was approved for and just stopped taking her.  Now she is treating her with homeopathy and diet changes (to be fair, they did identify a lot of allergies and A made some significant improvements after that) and waiting until A is old enough for therapy through the public school system, which won't be until she is 5/6.  R says she ""can't handle the screaming"" so A watches TV all. day. long.  I am no anti-TV-fanatic, we watch our fair share, but I literally mean all day long.  When we go over to their house, their TV is on Nick Jr. and Disney movies all day.  To get A to eat, they put shows on the iPad and set it up on the table in front of her plate.  To go shopping or in the car or out to eat, they put shows on their phone and hand it to her.  I try not to judge because I'm not her and I don't have a special needs child so who's to say I would do things differently, but I feel like it's just not fair to A and it makes me sad every time we hang out and I see this going on.

R and her husband set absolutely zero boundaries for A and it is so difficult to spend time with them that my husband has said he absolutely will not anymore.  We had one family outing with them almost a year ago and it was so painful that we didn't try again until this weekend, and it was exactly the same.  We were at a very busy theme park, and A (who is only 2.5) was running around through crowds of people, trying to go up down escalators, playing with fountains, knocking over displays in gift shops, crawling in the street, etc.  R doesn't require her to even hold hands, they just let A do whatever she wants because she screams if they try to stop her.  Several times they would tell her not to do something and the instant she screamed, they immediately relented and let her do it.  Our trips out are very different - we love our son, but we have boundaries, like having to hold hands or be carried in busy places, and if we need to get somewhere (like to a restaurant for dinner, bathroom for diaper changes, etc.) that is not the time for exploration, it's go time.  R even mentioned how terrified she was someone was going to snatch A while she was running around, and when I said we have a strict hand-holding rule for theme parks, she said that was a good idea but maybe when A was older.  /facepalm

Since A's autism diagnosis, R has also become an anti-vaccine crusader (even though A only had one vaccine, and it wasn't even MMR).  She is constantly posting anti-vaccine blog posts on Facebook and when anybody argues with her or posts real science, she refuses to see that the blog posts and anecdotes she relies on are not actual scientific data.  She is aware that I vaccinate my kids and doesn't bring the issue up to me directly or in person, but she is always posting about how sad it is that parents don't ""do their research"" about vaccines and whether or not it is passive aggressively targeted at me, it *feels* like it is and makes me angry.

I really don't know what to do.  The final straw is my husband just found out today that R, who is pregnant again, is regularly consuming marijuana still.  It boggles my mind that she told me she will not take zofran and is planning on declining rhogam despite being rH-, both of which have been studied in pregnant women and been proven safe, because of ""risks,"" but will eat/smoke pot which has been studied with inconclusive and contradictory results.  Every few months I decide that I just won't call R anymore and will let the friendship die - we live about a half hour drive away from each other, so we have a hard time coordinating get togethers anyways - but I always forget or decide it must not have been that bad last time and give her another chance.  

I also firmly believe that we need to fight the ""mommy wars"" by not judging other parents for their choices, but R's choices are just...beyond what I consider tolerable.  It seems to me that she is actively having a negative impact on A and potentially her unborn baby through her choices, and I really honestly think people who won't vaccinate and don't have a valid medical reason are being ignorant and selfish.  I know there's a lot of propaganda out there to prey on frightened parents, but come on...she isn't just putting her own kids at risk, she's putting my baby who hasn't completed his vaccines yet at risk, as well as anyone who can't have vaccines because of allergic reactions or happens to not have the proper immune response to them.  In a recent conversation on Facebook, she told someone that since diseases like measles were already being reduced by measures like hand washing and modern hygiene, we don't need vaccines at all.  

If you read all of this, I'm impressed.  This is a lot of mental garbage that has been rattling around in my head for quite some time now.  If you have advice, if you have been there, if you think I'm being stupid and judgmental, let me know.

It's so much better, he's not scratching like he used to. But I've noticed other changes I hadn't expected and wanted to share them in case anyone else's babe might have a food sensitivity but you aren't even aware of it.

First off, Spence no longer spits up half of what he eats, and due to that change he no longer stuffs himself and hangs out on the boob as long as I'll let him. He ""gets in and gets out"". This also makes night feeding shorter. Also instead of pooping 5 times a day, a creamed spinich-esque mucousy poop, he poops once every day or two, the normal thick mustardy poop a breast fed baby is ""supposed"" to have. In the beginning I wondered why his poop was so green, but was told that all sorts of colours can be normal and not to worry about it. I now see it was a symptom of him not using my milk very efficiently. And finally, he always had a touch of diaper rash we could never get quite under control, that was the first thing to go when I cut out milk. As an added bonus to me I've lost 5 pounds without trying!

So if your baby has eczema, diaper rash, lots of spitting up, green mucousy poops, blood in his stool, lots of gas and fussiness, please consider an elimination diet to see what the triggers are.

Yesterday he brought his 3DS home from his dad's house for the first time, and I informed him I'd be giving it an audit (like I do all of his Internet connective devices).

I asked him to loan me his DS when he went to bed, and after doing some checking to see who he talks to and his browsing, I found a bookmark in his browser for Pornhub. He doesn't know I know yet.

I'm not mad. I want to get that straight first. I'm not thinking, ""Oh not my innocent baby boy.""  He and I have talked about sex, porn, and sexuality. He is presently trying to grasp his sexuality and sexual identity (which I support fully, however he identifies).

He has previously said he didn't look at porn and when we have talked about his random erections and other puberty issues he hasn't seemed to indicate much sexual attraction or interest. Of course, this could be because I am his mom and he isn't sharing *everything* with me.

I went through the site and am pretty much ambivalent about him looking at porn, however, I want to make sure that what he sees is in the right context. I can't guarantee he isn't going to stumble upon porn that is depicted in a violent way, or even more fetishy stuff. 

I'd rather not have him delving into fetish porn so young, as he is still shaping his sexuality and he's quite emotionally immature. 

So mommit, what would you say to your son? 

How do you start the discussion? How do you put it in the proper context?

tl;dr Found porn on 12yo's 3DS and I'm okay with it, but how should I talk to him about it?

**UPDATE**
Thank you everyone for the perspectives, advice, and information! It helped steer me in a coherent path and I just got done speaking to him.

We sat down for lunch and I started with:
&gt;""Alright so you know how you loaned me your DS and I said I was going to look over your activities. Anyhow, I wanted to talk to you about something. I'm not mad, upset, and you've done  nothing wrong. 
&gt;
&gt;I found a bookmark to a porn site on your DS, and I think it's time we talk about the difference between sex in porn and sex between two romantic partners.""

He said the bookmark wasn't his and he claimed to know nothing about it, which I really can't believe as no one else has had access to his DS except for me last night. I was mildly disappointed he wasn't honest, but I understand and didn't act like I thought he was lying. 

I treated his explanation as the truth and went on to talk about porn vs actual sex. We talked about fetish porn a bit, and I explained to him what it looks like versus the reality. 

I did ask him to avoid hardcore porn and fetish porn, and gave him my reasons. Additionally, I told him that porn is free and easy to find but the Internet is filled with porn sites with malware. 

He kept saying he wasn't interested in porn yet, and so I told him that if he'd like one day I could make a bookmark folder of some ""reputable"" porn sites where he wouldn't worry about malware and asked that he never click through links to adverts or 3rd party sites from any porn site. 

It also gave me an excuse to have the condom talk with him again, because many porns don't show condom usage and I wanted to explain to him why and why he **must** wear condoms. 

tl;dr 2: Talked to son, he claims it wasn't his porn and I gave him the talk anyhow. Everybody left content.",,False,,t5_2s3i3,1371947246.0,,,True,t3_1gvb0d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1gvb0d/porn_and_puberty_what_are_some_good_ways_to/,

(Not sure whether to do a nudity warning, I mean this is a birthing video, so it's kind of a given, just don't want to be crude accidentally.)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNhCWsDVQI

My only worry is that there's so much risk in an outdoor environment of the baby getting some kind of infection, or getting way too cold, or even the fact they didn't clear the child's air way.
I understand wanting to have a calming birth, but the mother responded to comments asking at what point did the child go to hospital and she said the baby was now fifteen months old and had never been because 'medicine is for sick people'. Surely every mother sees the advantage of having a simple heel-prick test after birth to check for easily cured conditions or jaundice etc? Not to mention vaccines?

Edit: I must stress, I am not talking about home births, I have nothing against home births provided there are medical personnel there in case something bad happens and there is a hospital feasibly-nearby. Home birth is simply how I found this video.

He came to the delivery (and frowned like it was the worst thing to ever happen to him) and saw him maybe 3 times after that. Out of fucking nowhere (pardon my French) he decides he wants to be a part of his life again. Not just part of his life, but in essence take him from me. He took me to court, he lost that battle, but got every other weekend (per my request)

Now, this morning, he is coming to pick him up. Last night I had to tell him what formula to buy, what size diapers he wears, etc etc, because he still hadn't asked about it the night before he is supposed to take him.

He has never cared for an infant before. When I asked him how to wash a bottle, give him a bath, mix and make formula he said ""well, Ill figure it out"" Not to mention, my son is ill. He is so clogged up that he is having trouble eating and sleeping. I am giving him albuterol (sp?) a few times a day, prescribed by his doctor.

I asked him to please come up for a few days before the first weekend so he could get to know my baby's routine and learn how to care for him. He said no.

I got a doctors note from his pediatrician saying it would be a bad idea for his father to take him for the weekend considering he is ill and he has never been away from me before, and that taking him away from me while he was ill would be detrimental to his mental and physical health. I asked his father if he would rather just come up and spend the weekend at my home and visit instead of taking him two hours away from me when he was sick. he refused.

I am so scared of for the well being of my child. He has no idea how to care for him- none at all. My poor boy is so sick that he is going into coughing fits where I have to turn him over on my legs and smack his back.

We have two roommates and their 10 month old as well. My fiancé is not the father, but has been there a little while after my son was born. “T” goes to his dad’s house every other weekend, and sometimes for a day here and there when I have to work irregular hours.

He’ll be 3 in February. T is overall a good, polite child. He’s smart, loves singing and counting, reading books, playing games, etc. On my days off when I’m cleaning or some other organizing activity, he’s usually fantastic about occupying himself. He has a new puppy which he cleans up after, takes outside to the backyard on his own, etc. 

Lately, not so much. This past week he has shown me this other side to him and it is seriously the devil side to his normal angel. Yesterday, he lost one of the two turtles we have in a pond, got the puppy all muddy, wouldn’t listen at dinner time, hit the other animals. Woke up this morning, colored on the carpet in sharpie (thank god we were already getting that replaced), colored all over himself, used his toy pliers to pinch the puppy’s ear, threw his plate of food at lunch, didn’t want what I gave him for breakfast, clogged the toilet, and now he is currently screaming in his room and throwing toys because I didn’t give him candy.

The eating thing has been going on the past couple weeks, here and there. He’ll say he’s starving while we’re cooking, and when it gets to the table he’s suddenly not hungry. Since Thanksgiving, I’ve been making simple meals that he LOVES and yet won’t eat. I’ve done the whole, if you don’t eat this now this is what you’ll eat later until you finish it. It works. Sometimes. 

He rarely naps. I’ve been trying to change our schedule up somewhat, waking up earlier and being super busy in the day, then around 2-3 make him snuggle me in the bed. Sometimes I’ll turn on a movie and we’ll watch it together, just to give him atleast some quiet time. Most of the time that he naps it’s because he was throwing a tantrum in his room and passed out. I’m sure today though when I drive around 6-7 to pick up SO (we share a car right now), he’ll fall asleep, be super cranky at dinner time right after we get home, and have trouble going back to sleep. 

At bed time, and when we ask him to do a chore (pick up his toys, change in to pajamas, etc), he starts STALLING. And he knows what’s good and bad. “Mama, I want to brush my teeth.” “No mama, take Carson out to go pee.” “Mama, I gotta pee.” “Mama I need water.” I tried letting him accomplish those things then get back to the original task, or flip it. “Put on your pajamas and then we’ll take Carson out.” “We brush our teeth next,” etc. But then he starts an even longer list of things he has to do and will start flipping out when I finally stop him and tell him no, it’s time to read a book and go to sleep. He’ll try to get up to pee about 8 more times.

What do I do? I feel bad for constantly putting him in time-out when he’s bad. While writing all this out, it makes me feel bad, he’s just being a normal almost-three year old, but I am stressed over it. He’s usually worse right before he goes to his dad’s, which is this weekend, and I don’t know how to stop it. He has stopped throwing his tantrum now and I sat him at his easel to color, but it is only a matter of time before I turn my back and he colors on the puppy or does something else he normally doesn’t do. I mostly needed this just to rant but..some advice would be grateful. Routines are hard, some days I work nights and some days I work days. SO works days, which also vary. 

Thank you.

I knew it would be hard, but it's nothing like I thought it would be. He has a few health issues that we're working to get under control, and that is incredibly stressful/worrisome/exhausting. On top of that, he hasn't taken an uninterrupted nap longer than 45 minutes since he was 3 weeks old. We're lucky if he'll stay asleep more than 10-15 minutes at once during the day, and it's an absolute miracle if he naps longer than 1 hour at a time, even with us helping him. He doesn't like swings, and screams bloody murder if I try to put him in a sling or carrier. He used to be able to sleep in the car pretty well, but that stopped a few weeks ago and now he screams the whole time. 

The one saving grace WAS that he started sleeping well at night early on, and from the time he was 5 weeks only woke once at night to feed. But now he's started to hit some sort of sleep regression and is waking every 1-2 hours at night. My husband works long hours and we're both running on empty. We have nothing resembling a marriage anymore, and I can barely find the time to take a shower, nevermind even attempting to take care of myself beyond that. The only times we've eaten home-cooked food is when family is staying with us, otherwise it's fast food/take out every night. We both feel like total crap all the time.

I went back to work when he was 8 weeks old and I think that's the only thing that's kept me from having a complete breakdown. Even days when work is stressful, it's still easier than taking care of the baby. When I walk out the door after dropping him off at daycare in the morning, a huge weight is lifted off my shoulders. 

I can't even begin to figure out how we're supposed to have anything resembling a normal life with our son. Everything I was expecting to be able to do (have him in a carrier while I did housework, catch a nap while he's napping, take him for quiet walks in the park) is impossible. I'm miserable as a new mom, and I feel like it's doing serious damage to our marriage, not to mention our health and general wellbeing.

I just don't know where to go from here.

He's 10 months old and probably from about 3 or 4 months, I would imagine bad things happening to him. Absolutely NOT in a ""I wish this would happen"" way. More of a ""how would I react if _________ happened?"". Most of the situations my brain comes up with make me cry and feel sick and I want to know if this is normal. I didn't ever have PPD or anything like that, and nothing my brain comes up with involves me harming him. 

For example, we're on the third floor of an apartment building and his changing table is by a window, while I'm changing him, sometimes I imagine him somehow rolling out of the window (which he couldn't, they don't even open all the way).

1333645941.0,30,self.Mommit,ruvl4,To swear or not to swear?,cdub88,34,4,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/ruvl4/to_swear_or_not_to_swear/,"That is the question, but it's not about whether I should watch what I say, it's about whether my children should.  Now, before I get everyone all riled up and turn this post into a downvote graveyard, here's what why I think what I think and have come here to look for sound advice from other moms who I have a lot of respect for.

See, I don't see why cussing is a bad thing except for the fact that it may offend some people who might hear it.  But in that regard, lots of things you could say with or without the use of swear words could offend someone.  Just as you grow to understand you can't tell a complete stranger they smell like poop, you learn which situations you can and cannot use swear words.  It's a part of developing social awareness.  I just don't understand what makes ""bad words"" so bad just because of age.

I have a boy that just turned 3 and a 2 month old little girl.  I recently quit my job to stay home for the next two years to raise my children.  I haven't changed how I talk at home and not surprisingly, my little boy occasionally says a ""bad word"" he picked up from me.  And the thing is, as long as he's using it in correct context and not to hurt anyone in any way, I sincerely don't give a shit.

I can see how this might ruffle some feathers down the road so here's what I imagine my first encounter with a teacher regarding this matter might be like:

Teacher:  We have a serious problem with your son.
Me:  Oh really?  What happened?
Teacher:  I heard him say something bad on the playground today.
Me:  What did he say?!
Teacher:  He used the ""F"" word.
Me:  In what context?
Teacher:  It doesn't matter what context it was, he can't say it!
Me:  Why not?
Teacher:  Because it's a bad word and he's still a child!
Me:  Did he use it to hurt someone's feelings?
Teacher:  No, but other kids heard it.
Me:  So?
Teacher:  So?!  It's a bad word and he shouldn't say it!!!  Would you allow your son to watch violent movies or drink alcohol before he's ready?
Me:  Of course not.  Seeing something really violent might give him nightmares and his growing body is obviously not prepared to handle anything as harmful as alcohol.  
Teacher:  So you see my point, then?
Me: No.
Teacher:  Well, it's against the rules.
Me: Well in that case, I'll have a talk with him so he understands that while he's at school, he can't say ""bad words"".

Then after I leave, the teacher will probably call me a bitch behind my back.  Haha!

So seriously, I haven't come here to rant and persuade other moms.  I really do want to see if I've somehow missed an important point here that I need to consider while I try my best to raise well-adjusted children. 

tl:dr- Why shouldn't I let my kids cuss?

edit:  Wow, thank you all for taking the time to respond with such thoughtful answers!  I found them very insightful and have given me a lot to think about.  I also wanted to make one other point.  My cousin and good friend is a child psychologist and she once told me (back when I thought no child should ever cuss) that when a troubled kid calls her a ""bitch"", she simply says with a straight face, ""anything else you'd like to share?""  The reason, she said, was that the word itself didn't hold any power unless it was fueled by reaction.  She explained to me that words are powerless until our response teaches the child what powers their words have.  By not acting outraged, she takes away the power to be abusive with the word.  That was the first time I ever thought about seeing a curse word as just another word by simply changing my reaction to it.  And so, over time, I've come to feel differently about words and how they're used and how I'll raise my kids in a world where these words exist.  I know not everyone feels the same about expletives, so there will be times where lessons are learned and probably with the price of my embarrassment.  A lot of lessons are learned that way (like my bare-assed boy, peeing on a tree in the park).  It's not that I want them to swear, it's that I don't want words that I might use now and again to be off-limits to them for no other reason than an invented standard.

I just wanted to share my attempt at thwarting planned teen pregnancy in this school (these are middle schoolers).  Please don't think I have anything against teen parents, I know a lot, but most of them have said they wish they would have waited.  



The kids on my bus were playing with {my son} and he was, of course, being absolutely adorable. One of the kids said ""He's so cute!"" another one: ""They get so easy at this time, don't they?"" another: ""I want a baby so bad!""

 

So I, being the responsible adult, said; ""Kids, there's a reason why babies are so cute and also a reason why animals eat their young. Everyone says how awful newborns can be- but they are wrong. Newborns are easier than you think. Sure, you're sleep deprived, the baby is constantly on you, and if you're nursing, your chest will hurt. Your body will still be recovering and your hormones out of whack, but these will be the easiest times for a long time.

 

Because newborns start rolling over before you realize and you will be so proud. Then they start to get up on their knees and rock- you're still proud! Look at my baby! Then they start to crawl and no longer stay where you put them and the horror sets in- stuff just got real. Then the speed crawling, the cruising, and then... the walking. Your life is officially over, it seems.

 

You will crave those sleep deprived newborn days- anything over the little turd in your cabinets, pulling out everything; anything over the constant gogogo; the sleepless growth spurts, the diaper removing and poop smearing, the screaming; the endless hours of screaming when they stay up too late and are too wired to sleep; the frustration when they realize how adults communicate and that they are pre-verbal, so now they hit, bite, pinch, and yell at home, in public- and you will be looked at like you're just AWFUL. Babies are cute until they are yours.

 

They're worth it, but they are so, so, so much more difficult than they are made out to be. Please wait until you're older, more mature, have been able to live a little, and have the income to support the butt creams, the soaps, the clothes, the 75 dollars a month in diapers alone, and the formula- GOD THE FORMULA. They will be so much cuter when you have the patience and are not fighting to make ends meet.""

 

There was a considerable amount of time where there was silence. One kid made a sound of disgust- ""I'm NEVER having kids.""

I thought this might be entertaining.  The faces of some of these kids were just horrified.  I should have mentioned the poosplosions in the middle of a store when you have forgotten the extra set of clothes- and possibly the diaper in the car- then have to parade around your naked (diapered child) or dash to the car while they pee down your side.  I should have mentioned the nights you spend sobbing, knowing you have work in the morning and it's already 2am and they won't go to sleep.  There's a lot I left out, but I only can keep their attention for so long.  :)",,False,,t5_2s3i3,False,,,True,t3_ho99s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/ho99s/how_i_terrified_the_kids_on_my_bus/,

At least 5-6 days out of the week, because their father(my boyfriends brother) has been away for work for 4 months and their mother started to work. They are 9, 5, and 2. I also have an 8 month old of my own. I have always had an okay relationship with their mother, we'll call her Sue. Always cordial but never super close. Well ever since this whole arrangement started it has been nothing but pure bullshit, on her part. Sue is a loving mother, don't get me wrong, but ever since I came into the picture as ""nanny"" she has taken advantage of me. She will often stay at work WAY longer than she should, sometimes even coming home hours after they are closed. My boyfriend works at the same place she does so I know when she should be home. Basically she stays out drinking. I know because im not stupid, can smell it, and can tell she is clearly inebriated. Now i understand that everyone deserves a break but this is just ridiculous. She is a mother of 3 beautiful, intelligent children. And since their father is away these children need her even more. Some nights when she works, she won't even get home until after 4 in the morning. The bar she works at can't even stay open past 2 o'clock. So what she does in that 2 hours is beyond me. So as I sit there feeding, bathing, and tucking her children in bed she is out pretending as if she has no responsibilities. How can she not see this as an issue? I can't even be at home with my son, tucking him in HIS bed some nights because she wants to stay out. Her eldest, 9, is smart enough to realize what's going on. She constantly wants to call her mother to see when she's getting home. Her 9 year old asked to see a therapist. Now I have nothing wrong with a child wanting to see a therapist, but when your child specifically asks to see one because she worries herself sick(literally, she gets bad stomach pains), there is something seriously wrong. So i get the lovely job of telling them that mommy ""has to stay late at work again"". No 9 year old should have that much anxiety. Especially one with two capable parents. I just don't see how Sue can continue with her behavior even after knowing how much it hurts her children. It's starting to take a toll on the middle child, he's 5. His behavior has gotten worse and worse as this whole arrangement goes on. He often talks back to me, calling me annoying. He get inches away from my 8 month olds face and screams as loud as he can whenever I happen to be looking away or paying attention to the other kids. He'll often get a little too rough with him, not 5 year old rough but rough for an 8th month old. I've caught him aiming his nerf dart gun at him, constantly taking toys out from his hands to make him cry and stealing his pacifier and hiding it. I know the nerf darts  probably  not do any actual damage but what happens when he tries something more harmful? I've tried simply asking him to stop this behavior, explaining to him how an 8 month old is a little bit more sensitive than a boy his age but its useless. Ive tried time out, he just destroys whatever room he is in and yells the whole time. I even brought it up to Sue, she expressed concern as well and said he would speak to him  but this behavior continues. I know he is a sweet kid, so  i feel like his actions are just a cry for attention and a way for him to express his anger. And the youngest, she's almost 3 is still in diapers and I have showed up to babysit multiple times and Sue has left me no diapers for her. Not a single one. So I have to use my sons diapers, which didn't bother me at first but when it's happening frequently I'm not okay with it. Now...don't even get me started on the state of their house. I fully understand that it is next to impossible to keep a clean house with 3 children, I grew up in a household of 6 so I understand messes happen. But when there is 3 day old food on the table, dirty dishes littering the counter, piles of clothes in every room, and spoiled food in the fridge I can only assume that you literally don't do jack shit. Everyday I am appalled at the disaster of a house I walk into, which I end up cleaning up(as little as I can because I am NOT her damn maid) because I cannot let my child and her kids eat at a table with the old pancakes and eggs she cooked for breakfast 2 days ago. 

I've spoken to the father once about her behavior, before it escalated to what it is now, and he basically brushed me off and said he'd talk to her. My boyfriend just tells me to quit, that she is crazy and I shouldn't put up with her crap. But I just can't, I can't leave these kids in babysitter limbo, with someone who might not do as good of a job as me. And I know I sounds awfully full of myself but I work my  absolute hardest to ensure those kids are taken care of. This whole situation confuses me because when their father was here, everything was fine. The house was always a mess but her drinking, lying, and just all around crazy behavior was unheard of. Maybe this is just a phase, I don't know. Maybe I'm overreacting. I honestly just needed to rant and maybe need some unbiased advice.

My daughter is 3. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this because I feel like a horrible mother for not potty training her by now, but I honestly thought she would take interest in it in her own time. Her doctor isn't concerned at all, but now that we've got another baby on the way I decided enough is enough and decided to start this morning. In the past, we've tried sticker charts, books and videos, treats/rewards, picking out her own potty &amp; toilet seat (she likes to play with and sit on them but won't actually go-- never has), choosing her own panties, etc, but she still wants her diapers. It's been two hours since I refused her a diaper and she's been inconsolable this whole time. The. Whole. Time. She won't keep her panties on, is thrashing around on the floor and is acting generally monsterish. Her voice is getting hoarse already. I feel terrible, like I'm torturing my precious child. The way she keeps looking at me isn't helping, either. :( It's breaking my heart! 

What am I doing wrong?! Is this really worth it?? Is she just not ready? This is probably harder on me than it is on her, but dang, she's taking this *much* worse than I anticipated. 

Also, what do I do at nap time/bedtime? She typically takes a 3-4 hour nap during the afternoon and sleeps for about 10-12 hours each night; she usually has 1-2 pees in her diaper when she gets up. Do I let her pee in her bed or put a diaper on her for the time being? Would that confuse her?? 

Any wisdom on this would be greatly appreciated! 

**Edit/update:** After about 5 hours, she asked for her panties and put them on without issue, then went down for her nap without complaint! No accidents yet but she still didn't do anything on the potty beforehand. I'm just glad she's not so upset anymore.

I thought training boxing and kickboxing made me tough. I was wrong. Watching my wife the past 6 months PLUS the 9 she was pregnant just blew my mind. I don't care how much help you have, being a mom is really tough. I help as often as I can and I still feel like I am not doing enough. Especially you single mothers. My hat goes off to you. I have my baby boy about 3 hours an evening while mom is at work and it is tough. I can just imagine how tough it is for her. Anyways, on to the questions..... 

**New dad question 1:** We have a 6 month old boy who is the light of my life. My wife, who is a wonderful mother, has been breastfeeding (pumping when she is at work) for a little over 6 months now.  She just went to see her OBGYN about getting the Paragard. They said they would wait two more months and if she hadn't had her period yet, they would go ahead and put it in.

We have been using condoms (aside from the 15 seconds we both were weak willed the other day, but I still went and put one on to be safe). Have any of you other moms went this long without a period while breastfeeding? We are so sick of using condoms but want to wait another few years before baby #2. 

**Dumb dad question 2:** Are women fertile the WHOLE time after having a baby or does ovulation still occur as normal even though there is no period? I keep hearing how easy it is to get pregnant after a baby (which makes me nervous about dipping it in for a few seconds the other night without a condom) but I don't really understand I guess. Should I be worry about ""pre-ejaculation"" for the 15 seconds of non-condom glory? Am I just being paranoid?

Our kitchen is really closed off from the rest of the house, so I can't keep an eye on him if he's playing in another room. He's not quite crawling yet but he rolls and scoots enough to get into trouble if we're not nearby. The kitchen is also really cramped, so there's not really any place to put him on the floor in there. I can put him in an exersaucer in the kitchen, but he'll get bored with that before long. Same with a high chair - I can give him some puffs to munch on but again this only holds interest for so long before he screams to get down. Keeping him restrained in something for the entire 30-45 minutes it would take me to cook just doesn't seem possible. I imagine this is just going to get more difficult as he gets more mobile.

",lillowtree,30,2,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/vy92d/my_mom_a_rant_a_terrible_no_good_day/,"This is a rant and I apologize but thank you, internet-friends/strangers, for reading and just sharing in this moment of frustration with me. AGHHHHHHHHHH
My relationship with my mother has always been complex. She was a single-mom and we were incredibly close during my childhood. As I came into myself and wanted more independence, we both had a difficult time. I wanted freedom and she always felt very possessive over me and did not even want me to go to college. I think she had this kind of dream that we would always live together. She kept me under lock and key until I was 18. I wasn't even allowed to leave the house past 9PM. 

Flash forward: I'm 25 years old, and having my first baby. Granted, my boyfriend and I had not been dating very long and it was a whirlwind of a pregnancy. (I didn't find out I was pregnant till about 10 weeks, because I didn't think I could be due to PCOS and bicornate uterus, oh just whatever) But my mom really freaked out. Like, really. It was an incredible bonding experience for me and my boyfriend, bringing me closer to him than anyone I've ever met in my entire life. I had a very, very hard labor, lasting nearly 52 hours, in which I chose to get an epidurral or face maternal exhaustion and potential c-section. My mom came into the room and was SO disappointed that I got the drugs, that she sat in a chair with her arms crossed, saying ""I can't believe you let her do that to the baby."" ""I am so ashamed of you."" etc. So, my boyfriend said to her, ""I think you need to leave this room right now. We will hear none of that."" Now, this was the most amazing thing anyone has ever done for me, actually standing up for me. MY MOM WAS FURIOUS. The nurses were basically like, ""Get out now."" and escorted her out. And once she was gone, I was able to get some rest, wake up, and push my baby out later that day. He was a healthy 9lb 8 ounce baby. Honestly, I wanted to have a natural birth, but it just didn't work out that way and I am so TIRED of feeling guilty for getting medicine. I just don't think there's any thing wrong with getting it when you need it, and let me tell you... I needed it.

So now, fast forward four months, my mom is still not speaking to me. When the baby was born, she didn't even want to hold him. :( She would not return any of my phone calls until today. I didn't even want to fight about what happened, but instead she calls me up to tell me again WHAT A HORRIBLE PERSON I AM for getting the epidurral and how could I disrespect her? And I am doomed to be left by my boyfriend and not to come crawling back to her?? AHHHHH, so hurtful, I feel like my heart is breaking... 
Man, as if being a new-mom isn't hard enough... It makes me sad to think that I might have to cut her out of my life, there is nothing more I can do or say. 


Okay, thanks for listening/reading. Agh.

I know it's coming from her anus as I was able to catch some on a wet wipe while she was in the process. 

I took her to the Dr. He suspected anal fissures and told me not to stress too much but I wasn't convinced. I had a feeling she was perhaps allergic to the formula I was giving her (I don't produce enough milk) when she started screaming in pain after a feed. I sent my husband out to get her some lactose free formula to try but decided to take her to the hospital also.

The ER Doctor believes it could either be gastro or a milk allergy. I still suspect it's more so the allergy as her nose was also congested and one of her eyes watery, which apparently are symptoms and as soon as I switched formula her eyes stopped watering immediately. 

Problem is, she has not done a poo the entire day. It is now 11pm and I am concerned as she usually soils about 5 a day. Is it possible that the change of formula has caused her to become constipated???

Today I was getting ready to depart for coffee while setting up my 6 month old in the exersaucer and I turned around and another boy who has been slightly aggressive to my daughter before was slapping her hand away from the toys attached to the exersaucer hard enough to make a slap noise.

I immediately asked him not to do that and pulled her arm out of his hand when the mom came over and got mad at me saying they don't use the word no and prefer not to discipline their child. So what she did was take him over to another exersacuer with the other baby who is 8 months old and got him to play with those toys because that baby is bigger.

The toddler is 2 years old and I know the parents use AP big time, but I feel they should have some sort of discipline for him. The other times he has been aggressive, I was holding my daughter and just moved her away from him and the mom always just laughs it off.

You all gave me such great advice so I figured I'd update you on our progress. In case you don't remember my post it's the only thing I've ever posted on this account and I'm on my phone so I don't know how to link it :/ but it was about how I feel like all I ever do is yell.

Well since that post I've really tried to take a step back and try some of your suggestions bc I didn't enjoy being that kind of mommy. We're making great progress! I've been trying to talk calmly as much as possible and give him more warnings when it's almost time to do something so it doesn't come as such a shock. When he refuses to do something like take a bath I just walk out of the room and start to fill the bathtub up, I'll say things like ""okay, well your t-Rex is gonna take a bath then"" and 9 times out of 10 he'll come running and get in! When it's time to leave in the morning to go to the babysitter I've been trying things like ""the next time commercials come on we have to get our shoes on"" and even though he says no I stand firm (but not yelling or mean) and tell him since the commercials are on we have to go, and it's been working pretty good. I've found that by me staying calm he stays calm and we're able to work it out much better. We're still a work in progress but I wanted to thank you ladies so much. I think a large part of it was that I was just so frustrated in MY life that I was redirecting my frustrations on him, and that's not fair. I feel very bad and am trying to make it better for us. We've been working on the alphabet (I got some flash cards) and he's picking it up pretty good! He's been pretty good about bed time (however last night was horrible, probably one of his worst nights in a LONG time. He just kept screaming and crying. I tried to let him cry it out but finally went in and told him if he didn't calm down id turn his night light off. It worked but I felt bad having to threaten him like that) But thankfully that's not the norm.

Anyways I just wanted to thank you all for your thoughts and suggestions. And wanted to let you know your advice did not go untaken!
