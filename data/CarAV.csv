Let's talk.,LoganPhyve,28,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1d0s08/modpost_wiki_time_wiki_time_lets_talk/,"Good afternoon, fellow /r/CarAV brethren! It's announcement time! It's been a while since we've taken the time to do some housekeeping around here, and I want to toss something new into the mix.

You may or may not have noticed that we have enabled the r/CarAV wiki! We would like to start building this resource as a tool for new and experienced users alike. We have wanted to do this in the past, but due to some technical issues on reddit's end, there were initial launch problems with reddit's wiki platform on its first launch and the project went back to a disabled status.

Now that the bugs appear to be worked out, I want to open this opportunity back up for us and see what kind of information center we can grow.

That said, I'm now opening the floor for candid discussion of anything wiki. What I hope to achieve here is a topology and/or hierarchical layout of what users would like to see. I will take any and all suggestions into consideration and will help with the initial layout and structure. Once we have established a good working structure, I'll be adding /r/carAV users to wiki approved submitter status at request and we'll try to build a good resource for everyone to use. For the time being, it is mod-locked so we don't have anyone contribute to find their work changed or gone when we do the initial layout.

Here is a [link](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/index) to reddit's own top level wiki so you can see what their layout looks like and get a feel for how it will look and work.

Ok, your turn! What topics do you want to see, what should we initially focus on, what kind of information should be there.... let's talk!

1346762020.0,20,self.CarAV,zbzg7,[MODPOST] Let's grow the Reddit Audio Network once again.. Introducing r/CarAVclassifieds!,LoganPhyve,26,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/zbzg7/modpost_lets_grow_the_reddit_audio_network_once/,"Hiya r/CarAV!

We have had some inquires as of late regarding redditors using r/CarAV to buy, sell, and trade their new and used gear. While we encourage Redditors doing business with other Redditors (share the love!), we thought it best to keep commerce out of this subreddit and in its own. There are some fine examples which other subreddits have used very successfully.  /r/electronic_cigarette  and /r/ecigclassifieds work very well together to provide both a user community and a sales/trades front for users. They encourage commerce, but keep it separate from discussion. This is our goal: to keep the clean, informative and interesting posts flowing through /r/carav and allow a place for sales and trades. This will not only help keep CarAV content fresh, but free from ads that distract from its value. We do our best to keep spam at a minimum, so this is a great way to keep the spam filter properly trained while giving everyone the same rules - commerce will be encouraged at r/CarAVclassifieds from now on.

Without further ado, I humbly introdice to you folks /r/carAVclassifieds :) It's a new startup sub that Rudie and I are going to be building up in the near future. It's bone stock at the moment, but can be used as is. We will be adding customizations and sidebar data in the near future. For now, please feel free to subscribe, post, buy, and sell your new and used gear.

You are all encouraged to provide feedback, ideas, and general comments on the new classifieds site. We welcome any ideas that will help make our subreddits  more inviting, informative, and smoothly functioning places for Redditors.

Just wanted to show my car install that I've been messing with for some time now. My car install includes a USB DAC, flash drive, webcam, DVB-T for FM stations and a Joycon for steering wheel controls. All of these are connected to 2 USB Hubs that are externally powered.


I have the webcam mounted for my backup cam but am having some problems with it in the daylight so I might ditch it if I can't figure out a solution.


As far as reliability I drove 9 hours back to college with no freezes or hiccups. Since I made my hub externally powered the tablet get enough power to stay fully charged over long trips while using gps and screen brightness on full, but I should not have any problems with it staying charged with Timurs new USBROM that can enable fast charging.


I also have a few hidden buttons in my center console for the 3 tablet buttons and also a charge button to charge the tablet even when the car is off if the battery get low, for example its been below zero for the past week so my battery is probably extremely due to the extreme temperatures. I normally only lose 1-2% over night but since I haven't been driving my car these past couple of days I have lost ~20% in a 24hr period from the -10 degree temperatures we have had, which is when im glad i added a charge button so it can charge while i'm in the store or class or something.


Oh and for GPS and wifi antenna I ended up mounting above the headliner on the passenger side and ran wires to the connectors.


**I'm currently using** 

-Timurs USBROM with kernel built in  

-Power Amp

-mediaU to stream local radio stations

-Copilot

-Apex Launcher

-GMD Gesture Control

-Tasker

-Tablet Talk

-Probably others that I am forgetting


I'll try and get some pictures up, but feel free to check it out on XDA till I do.

Credit does NOT go to me. 

**This post was designed for the forum it was originally posted on which uses different formatting than Reddit. I'd suggest following the link the DIYMA below.** 

From Jazzy on the DIYMA forum: http://www.diymobileaudio.com/forum/1700914-post12.html

**Damping Materials: name-brand product vs asphalt-based alternative**

&gt;When I started learning about damping resonances and sheet metal, I was (like many people) surprised by how expensive materials like Dynamat, Hushmat and other name-brand CLD tiles were.  Many forum warriors were convinced it was a grand scam and we could easily substitute products from other industries with similar materials for much less money.  But there was much controversy about asphalt vs butyl, and weather or not the presence of foil backing made a difference, or how thick it should be, and so on.

&gt;At the time, I was in the middle of a physics class dealing with light, optics, waves and whatnot.  As an extra credit project I ran an experiment to see how effective a single layer of asphalt-based roofing sealer (Grace Ice and Water Seal as commonly suggested during my reading) would be compared to a single layer of Stinger Roadkill (the first name-brand product I found at a local shop).  The results were astounding.

&gt;If you are interested in the specifics, http://www.earsc.com/pdfs/engineering/understandingdamping.pdf this report from E-A-R Specialty Composites[/URL] is a great primer on the difference between a free-layer damping system (FLD) and a constrained-layer damping system (CLD).  One of their illustrations is below.  From what I understand, it seems a single very thin constrained layer sandwiched between two metals that are similar to eachother will give the best results.  So when shopping for a damping tile, find one with excellent adhesion, high temperature rating, a thin viscoelastic (usually butyl) layer, and a thick aluminum backing (ie. almost every name-brand product meets this).

In this example, a single layer of asphalt-based roofing material material with adhesive on one side attached to sheet metal is a free-layer damping system.  A layer of Stinger Roadkill is a constrained-layer damping system because it sandwiches the butyl between the aluminum backing and the sheet metal of the car.  Hopefully the above diagram helps.

The experiment was simple: measure the damping factor of resonances of my car door as it came from the factory, after applying asphalt-based product, and again after removing the asphalt and treating it with Roadkill.  In addition, I would test a single piece of sheet metal on the bench to see if there was a significant difference between trying to damp the resonances of my car door (a complicated system) vs a single sheet of steel (a simple system).

Damping factor is easy to visualize using an RTA and some division.  No complicated maths here.  [URL=""http://www.roush.com/Portals/1/Downloads/Articles/Insight.pdf""]Viscoelastic Damping 101, Roush Industries[/URL] is an article describing how to calculate it, and here is an example from TrueRTA in my measurements.

[I]Above is test 2: this is two layers of asphalt-based roofing applied over the top of the factory damping material.[/I]

[I]Above is test 3: all asphalt and factory damping materials have been removed, and about half of all accessible surface area has been treated with Stinger Roadkill, a constrained-layer damping material.[/I]

After each treatment the doors were fully assembled before taking measurements.  Essentially I hammered the outside of the door using a soft mallet and recorded the sound from the inside, used TrueRTA to help calculate the damping factor, then made some graphs.  First is the test using the car, the second graph is from a single piece of sheet metal suspended in air, and tested the same way.

[I]Above is damping factor of the car door untreated from the factory, after applying a single layer of asphalt-based roofing material (Grace), after a single layer of name-brand product (Stinger), and finally with additional Stinger Roadkill plus a layer of MLV for sound isolation.
(higher is better)[/I]


[IMG]http://jzazzi.smugmug.com/photos/i-tm84Scd/0/M/i-tm84Scd-M.jpg[/IMG]
[I]Above is the bench test of a single piece of sheet metal. (higher is better)[/I]

In the bench test, the result is obvious.  A single layer of asphalt-based roofing material provides some damping to the sheet metal, an increase of about 29% average damping factor.  But a single layer of CLD is phenomenally more effective with an average increase of 770%!  So, myth busted, Grace Ice &amp; Water Shield may be a fine roofing material, but it is nearly worthless as a damping material.

In the car door test, the results are much less clear.  Two layers of Grace yields an average decrease (!) in damping factor by 1%, but a single layer of Roadkill only has an increase of 13% on average.  Confused by this, I tried to go crazy and added more Roadkill to the outer door skin, applied some to the inner door skin, and then added a mass-loaded-vinyl barrier to the inner door skin to further isolate noise and prevent it from entering the cabin.  Even with these stronger measures I only saw an increase of 26% damping over the factory car door.

So what is going on?  Clearly from the bench test a single layer of Roadkill (on 25% surface area) should have a drastic effect on damping factor for sheet metal.  However the car door behaves differently.  I believe the car door having (1) an outer wall of sheet metal and (2) an inner wall of sheet metal and (3) another inner wall of plastic and vinyl door card and (4) air chambers between all these layers are responsible.  I believe the air chambers themselves have resonances that cannot be affected by damping the sheet metal and must be addressed other ways.

Conclusion?  Buy a CLD tile from a common brand (or sounddeadenershowdown) and apply it in a single layer over about 25% to 50% surface area for excellent results (adding more doesn't increase benefits for the high additional cost).  Also, further study needed to find sources of resonance in car doors.  I'll have measurements for a new idea to address this soon.[/QUOTE]

REVIEW,JakeWanaMakeHer,17,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1kehmg/welp_i_tried_it_peel_and_seal_for_sound_deadening/,"Well, I've been deciding on deadening my trunk for a while because the American Bass has been making my trunk rattle way too much for a while now. Being cheap and doing research, I decided to try Peel and Seal, even though it's for roofing, and is notorious for smelling bad.

To my surprise, this stuff actually worked GREAT! I only used one roll which costs around $18 at lowes. I covered most of the top of my trunk with two layers, and some of the more ""rattly"" parts with three. I had a little extra and also put a layer on the very back of my trunk.

I really wasn't expecting much of a result, but wow! The terrible rattling sound coming from my trunk was ruining my whole car audio experience and I'm so glad I tried this. Sometimes the rattling was too much on songs that I would have to turn the sub off completely. But now it's nothing but pure clean bass! I'm honestly amazed with this stuff. At a certain lower frequency there is still a tiny noise when the seats are up (usually kept folded down) but Its barely audible. 

I just wanted to recommend this to anyone looking for some cheap deadener. It has a rep for smelling bad when hot, however I haven't noticed a smell at all, at the last two days it was in the 80's and 90's. It also stuck extremely well and I had no problems there.

1374530182.0,12,self.CarAV,1iubs7,RTA: An often overlooked way to dramatically improve SQ,o0jrock0o,15,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1iubs7/rta_an_often_overlooked_way_to_dramatically/,"So, you want Sound Quality in your car.  You've taken your time carefully installing your speakers, subs, and amps.  You're always fiddling with your crossover and EQ settings, trying to get everything to sound as close to the recorded music as possible.  Sadly, our ears are imperfect.  


So how can we take your car's audio system and use modern measurement tools to objectively improve sound quality on a budget?  The answer is Real Time Analysis.  All you need is a smartphone (iPhone or Android), [this](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?partnumber=390-810) microphone, and an RTA app like [AudioTool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.julian.apps.AudioTool&amp;hl=en) for Android or AudioTools for iPhone.  In essence, you play [pink noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise) through your audio system and the microphone monitors the signal and shows you a graph of how loud each frequency is.  This should be done in a quiet environment with the engine and AC off.  The goal, in essence, is to get the graph to be flat.  Now, most high-end car audio systems are probably going to have extra bass.  You should try to get flat response across the bass frequencies, but how much bass you have is a matter of taste. 

The best method to achieve good frequency response is equalization.  This can either be an EQ built into your head unit or a separate piece of hardware.  Basically, you're going to look at the frequency graph and decide where you need boosts/cuts and adjust your EQ to get the graph to look as flat as possible across the mids and highs.  If done correctly, the improvement in sound quality will be very pronounced and you might even notice some crazy anamolies in frequency response you never imagined existed in your system.  

So, for less than $30 you can vastly improve SQ in your car audio setup.  The microphone manufacturer also provides a custom calibration file for each mic that you can load into the phone app to make sure you're getting as good a result as possible.  This is a very worthwhile investment, as you can use the microphone in your car, your friends' cars, your home theater, etc.  And I don't work for Dayton Audio or anything, I just think it's amazing how cheaply they can produce such a nice piece of hardware.

If you've made it this far, I applaud you.  If anything is unclear or needs to be explained better, let me know and I'll clarify it for you.",,False,self,t5_2t73y,False,,,True,t3_1iubs7,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1iubs7/rta_an_often_overlooked_way_to_dramatically/,

We did 3 sets of infinity 6x9 speakers, A Rockford Fosgate Punch 400.4, Pioneer 5000UB, Optima yellow top battery.  We Mounted the radio with a boat housing seal kit.  The speakers we water sealed as well.  One of the guys in our shop created a false floor on a henge to hide the battery and keep everything looking very clean.

Bought them used from a friend for a steal, knowing next to nothing about car audio. It hit hard, and sounded *decent*. I totaled the car and removed the head unit, sub, and amp. I thought about installing the old gear in my new 2013 Elantra, but thought, ""meh...I've matured past that. I'd rather save my hearing and trunk space."" Well, not long after acquiring this new car and listening to the stock speakers, the old adage held true: ""Once you ride with subs, you'll never go back.""

This time around, I had to do it proper: full system. At the recommendation of those here (and some of my own decisions), I purchased a Pioneer FH-X700BT, double DIN kit, Polk 6501 component speakers, Polk 651 coaxial speakers, Rockford Fosgate P3D4-12, Alpine MRV-M500, 4 gauge wiring, a sealed box, and a wiring harness for the deck. Whole package came out to $720 after tax and shipping from Amazon, installation was $400 ($450 after I called and told them to add a control knob for the sub).

It sounds incredible. I've never experienced such a clean and crisp sound in any of my cars. It can bang stupidly hard if I set the EQ to ""Super Bass"", but it comes at the cost of muddy sound. I currently have it set to just sound balanced; no bass boost or other gimmicks. I can't wait to offer to be the D.D. for the night, now!

TL;DR - My setup surpassed my expectations, and I want to thank y'all.",,False,self,t5_2t73y,False,,,True,t3_1g6glg,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1g6glg/thanks_to_you_jerks_im_1200_more_poorbut_damn_im/,

Yesterday I tried install some 0 gauge wire on my 05' Trailblazer EXT. What I did is put wire from battery - to car chassis , battery - to engine block, and finally alternator to battery +. When I finished everything up, I made sure I tightened everything and now the car does not start.

As of right now I can't even get my key out of the ignition. When I put the key to the ""on"" position, everything electronic works - radio, headlights, onstar, etc. Only thing that is a little weird is that I get ABS and E-brake warning lights even though the E-brake is not engaged. 

When I try to crank over the car, in the engine compartment I hear a sort of ""lock"". I can distinguish it from the starter and can confirm that the starter is probably not making that ""lock"" sound; it sounds pretty different from you normally hear from a dead battery. 


As a last resort I took off all the wire I added on and still the car will not start and the same problems persist. Anyone have any clue or anything I could try would be greatly appreciated because I need my car for work. I also tried jump starting the car and replacing the battery with another one and the car will still not start.

The car is a 2008 Dodge Avenger and has a good amount of trunk space, but I have absolutely no idea where to start with setting something like this up because of how many things you have to consider. I have tried reading the guides on the sidebar but it hasn't really helped me much because I don't know the terminology.  

I have no clue what kind of subs I want, but I was looking at a box for 3 12""s.

I hope I posted this in the right subreddit, but I waited to post and looked around first so this should be right. I appreciate any recommendations on what I should get because there are so many different brands I just can't wrap my head around them all. I'm pretty confident that once I can get a good setup sorted out and know that the amps and subs would be compatible I could set it up myself.

How would you guys feel about building up more interior and exterior resources? A couple of thoughts I had:

* Adding external car audio resource links to the side bar (the12volt.com, http://www.bcae1.com, http://www.soundsolutionsaudio.com, http://diymobileaudio.com, etc...). Perhaps a separate set of links for accessory/integration  product companies such as Metra, AI, peripheral audio, PAC etc.. (dash kits, harnesses, adapters, interfaces, modules) and maybe another set for major audio companies, A/V companies, and alarm companies. This could possibly cut down on questions from users that just don't know where to look for answers, give newbies a good beginner resource, and just give everyone an easily available database of info. This concept could go as far including things like reddit deals on tools/tool selling subreddit.

* Posting OC that deals with current make/model wire colors that may not be readily available on the net/sites like direct tech (good for unavailable new models and those that don't have access to sites like direct tech). This could also go back to all Makes/Models in the past to current. From what I remember from my car audio installation days at Best Buy years ago, one thing I did appreciate was looking at the BBY installer forum to find out info on newly released vehicles, or just tips and tricks all around.

* Perhaps a list of the car audio installers that frequent this subreddit by location. If you contribute to /r/CarAV and are an installer redditors that see your submissions who are located in your area may come to you for work, it helps to personalize things and give you exposure.

* In depth tutorials (possibly bimonthly). These could range from basics installs to how you custom fabricated a system, or box designs. For example, I sketch out most custom boxes I make depending on make/model and type of subwoofer(s), I wouldn't be opposed to sharing specs on them (it would cut down on time for us to build custom boxes for different vehicles .

* If the community grows future plans could include things like car shows/meetups, or even a joint effort by /r/CarAV to build a custom Reddit car. 

While I go to a plethora of forums and sites for car audio info I think it would be great to combine many of these aspects into the /r/CarAV subreddit if possible. While /r/CarAV is still small it will continue to grow and it would be great to build on top of the great subreddit CarAV already is.

My head unit is the Pioneer 7100bt.  I did some dremil work and mounted one of the rear USB's and the AUX to to front dash panel to make it feel a bit more factory then just having a cable hang out.

My Highs are running off of the Kappa Four class d.

The Subs are the MTX 9500 Series 12's in dual 4 ohm voice coils.  The box we made about a year ago which sadly i had to go back in and add screws to it.  The subs created too much flex in the wood and it broke the strut supports in the box, which caused the back, and front panel to rattle.  That's why it has screws in the front panel.

The Sub amp is the MTX Thunder elite 1501D Mono.  Running at 1 ohm.

**MUSIC:** Hip hop, Jazz, Soul, Alt Rock.  

I like QUALITY sound which is why I have a set of $300 DJ headphones from Pioneer that sound MUCH better then any equally priced set of DRE Beats. So I would love to have a car system to match.

I understand I need to build a system around the Head unit?  So I am looking for suggestions on good head units in my price range.  
I'd like something fairly simple looking, black with red lights to match the [instrument panel in my car](https://www.google.com/search?q=audi+a4+b5+instrument+panel&amp;aq=f&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=iOpgUYaLMrT9iQKgi4G4DA&amp;biw=1337&amp;bih=835&amp;sei=iupgUYfGHsbpiwKJloC4Dw#imgrc=T7qRDo_2AbZR9M%3A%3BrGU3dVREYu-suM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Ffarm1.static.flickr.com%252F152%252F341291759_a39c020bba_o.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.audizine.com%252Fforum%252Fshowthread.php%252F111958-FS-B5-A4-Sport-Steering-Wheel-with-Airbag-amp-Instrument-Cluster%3B1280%3B960).

Here's where I am really lost. I have no idea what brand of sub I should get, and I dont know if I should be going with the double or tripple layer speakers but(the woofers with the tweeters in em) I really like **detail** in my music so I don't simply wont something loud. But at the same time I want to be able to feel those low frequencies when the base goes.  

Maybe I'm asking for too much here folks... thats why I'm here, to get brought down to reality.


Oh and I dont know ANYTHING about Amps or any of the stuff that connects these speakers to the rest of the car and anything in between...



**EDIT**
I appreciate all the in depth responses, thanks boys.
I guess I should have added: The SPEAKERS ARE BLOWN. front two are scratchy, rear left has no audio whatsoever.

another one is i always wear a wallet chain always have. one day i was carrying a group 31 agm some how the chain hit the positive and negative went red hot caught my pants on fire then melted onto the floor causing a small fire. made my wife really happy.


then when i was really young 15-16 i had a system consisting of several different brands of speakers in different kinds of boxes prefab bandpass ported and sealed. all pushed by a little walmart jensen amp some kinda tape deck with auto reverse stock speakers up front and house speakers in the rear. for some reason the amp get real hot then cut out. glad i figured out the error of my ways. didnt take long til i was rocking the soundstream spl160.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. 

As my loving father pointed out, no, they are not symmetrical. 
Those are Polk Audio MM1240's.
I used special resin and fiberglass cloth from US Composites. I recommend it highly over traditional Home Depot stuff.
Including both subs, amp and materials, it all cost ~$850-$900
The resin smell remains, but is almost gone from my car. 
The rings I got made at a cabinet shop. 
Took ~5 days start to finish. 
I didn't cloth the backs of the boxes cause they can't be seen and I didn't want to mess with the glove-like fit. Although I think I may to add some cushion between the fiberglass and my car.
I still have to add the speaker wire quick-disconnects to make the boxes removable.

[I used this as my guide](http://www.gadrivers.net/~dwicker/fiberglass.html)

I liked it a lot.

Redoing my setup, figured I'd show it off. Yeah, not the greatest subs or amp but for the limited budget I've got its got some perks. New box tuned to 42hz (I listen to mostly rock music so went a bit higher).

Old box was a prefab, I have yet to add dynamat, cover everything, and make it look complete but so far it is sounding incredible. Def worth the time and effort. Used 3/4"" MDF, 1.9ft^3 per chamber. Hitting much lower and sounding much, much better.

",remarkable53,9,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1a5k6w/how_do_you_explain_to_someone_dvc_resistance_rms/,"I like to use analogy when trying to explain certain aspects of various specs.  

DVC (Dual Voice Coil) Look at your sneakers?  How many eyelets does it have?  Lets say there are 6, would having 12 make you jump higher, or run faster?  Does it improve the sneakers function? It does allow you different lacing configurations but not much else.  This would be what a DVC offers over a SVC.


Resistance:  Imagine a long hose and we needed to get water out about 200' how much pressure would it take? As the AC Current leaves the amp heading for the speaker the wire coils that are wrapped around the voice coil present resistance to that AC signal the less resistance will yield more water while the more resistance less however with less resistance you run the chance of the hose developing a kink or a hole because it is moving so much material thru.

RMS vs Peak power in amp ratings:  If any amp uses it's peak power rating as it's headline it's telling you it's a joke with a fuse.  Imagine you have to describe someone to me?  You would most likely start by saying this person is 6' tall wouldn't you?  You wouldn't say this person can jump high enough to touch the rim to describe a 6' tall guy.  That's in essence what using peak power vs RMS power or continuous power ratings is doing.  It's really total bullshit and one should not be considered when comparing amps.

Current draw:  You have $13.75 in your bank account.  Every month it cost you $11.00 to cover your expenses and in summer when you kick on your AC add $1.25 and if you own a pool add 35 cents.  So what are you left with? That's the same thing with your alternator and why the hell your lights dim and strobe to the beat of your 4000 watt Ampzilla sucking amp.  Your alternator can only generate so much current and the amp is demanding more than what is available and so it's taking current that was designed for other components and converting it into bass.  Your living on credit cards my man.  There can be no happy ending in this scenario.

I would really like to hear how others explain these and other terms we use daily to friends, customers or anyone wanting explainations.",,False,self,t5_2t73y,False,,,True,t3_1a5k6w,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1a5k6w/how_do_you_explain_to_someone_dvc_resistance_rms/,

This is a random set of images. In the front doors are Polk MM6501's, along with a fair amount of sound dampening. 

In the rear are Inifnity 6832cf 6x8's. Also behind the seats are two Sundown Audio SD2-10's 4ohm dvc. Powering everything are two Precision Power Black Ice amps. A BK520.4 95w x 4 rms for the components and rears along with a BK1300.1D @ 1ohm to the subs. 
The box was custom made by Supercrewsound.com, it fits well.
I used a Kicker 0 gauge dual amp kit to power everything up. 
I had enough left over to do the big 3 in 0 gauge. The alternator was also upgraded to a 200 amp model. 



Finally my favorite part. I had limited space and wire running options. So there was a mess behind the amps. I made the cover out of peg board and 4mm self adhesive sound dampening foam meant for a computer case. That turned out good enough that I made another piece to cover the front of the amps.

2. Your experience may differ. Not All Suggestions Will Necessarily Work For You. We are all beings of individual taste and that's some of the fun, listening to different systems and seeing if you can tell the difference and knowing why you like it.

The Sundown X-12s aren't out yet, ETA is June 30th. From what I hear they like larger boxes and are SQL low end monsters. So, I made a larger than average box that is tuned around the X-12's resonant frequency. **It is running a single SA-12 right now on 2x the rated power in a box that is tuned below its fs and is way too big for it.** The large box and low tuning reduces the SA-12's power handeling and I could potentially ruin the sub by doing this but SA-12s can take a lot of abuse before they even think about dieing. GL doing this with your Kicker crap lol. 

The box is done now and I can crank the music up to about 80% before I can hear the subwoofer being driven too far. Impressive to say the least.

I had plans of making a double baffle with nice rounded edges and what not but time did not permit. When I get the X-12 I'll add the second baffle. It's already cut so all I'll have to do is round some edges. 

Also, I added wood glue around the subwoofer cutout to make the mdf less prone to crumble. Over time that ish just falls apart from taking subs in and out. Hopefully the glue, which is where the screws go, the inside of the circle, and the underside, will help with this.

When the foam is done drying and curing I'll remove the tape, trim the foam, and add fabric to make it look nice and clean. The box will be carpeted too.

I am just looking for some opinions on what brands you like for speakers VS what brands you would *never* buy.

I am looking to build a system for my jeep, it has 6.5's all around. This will be a db system since I drive around with the roof and doors off, so sound quality isn't nearly as important as something i can actually *hear* when I'm driving on the highway.

As far as I understand it, never get Pyle, Lanzar, stay away from Boss, and schoche. Any other brands to definitely not get?

What about Power Acoustic, Dual, Sony?

I like Rockfords, I LOVE infinity, Alpine's are really good but very power hungry i hear.

This isn't the end all, be all since there are some good companies like Sundown Audio that aren't compliant, but that just means, that they test that output of the amplifier their own way.

  Everything is still stock and the tape deck is fuzzy and when i have my ipod plugged in with the cassette thing fades in and out. I am pretty sure the drivers side speaker is at about 15% capacaty and the only speaker that puts out any sound is the passanger front speaker. 

On to what i am asking: i would like a super basic setup to listen to things like the radio and my ipod at pretty normal levels.  

to do this what do i need specifically? i have deduced that i need a new deck, and probably a header (no idea what that is) and some speakers.  Anything else? also right now the radio console thing doesnt light up anymore even when the headlights are on, is this a potentially more widespread electrical problem or just the original deck being dumb?

Because i want such a basic setup i hope to not spend a lot, as the car isnt worth much and i really dont want to invest any real amount of money, i just want to be able to listen to music on my commute. (hopefully less than 400).

I used to put car audio systems into friends cars up until college.  I'd build boxes and calculate the required size of the ports if needed, correct volume of box stuffing, etc.

Now, I've noticed all of the names have changed, pricing seems to have come down (probably due to all of the pretty nice OEM stereo's newer cars have).

I have a '61 lincoln continental.  I'm planning to use a tablet as my only audio interface, hooked up to a bluetooth audio receiver that will plug directly into an amp.  I'm planning to do 2 front speakers, 1 or 2 subwoofers in the trunk, and didn't really have intentions for rear speakers.

I listen to electronica, dance, and occasionally rap.  I don't need a lot of bass, and I like the sound of an accurate closed box sub or a good frequency curved ported sub.  bandpass or peaky ported are out of the question.

The doors will need to be thin profile speakers.  I'd prefer coaxial mounted separates if those exist still.

The trunk will have 1 to 2 cu ft of space per sub, if using 2 subs.  2x10 or 2x 12 will fit according to my eyeballs.

I'm a fan of the idea of class D amps.  Low heat small, perfect for fitting under a seat.

What prices should i be considering?  What brands are decent?  I'm actually not a fan of pioneer, sony.  Back in the day, those brands sucked.  I like brands that people in this sub would know, but people off the street wouldn't recognize.  It's just an aesthetic thing.

To be honest, I have no clue what I'm looking for.

I listen to electronic music mainly, so what would be your recommendations?

The front speakers are 6""x1/4""-6""x3/4"" and the rear are 6""x9"".

Budget is around $200-$300.

Not sure that this is relevant, but I don't have a standard car stereo. I'll be putting in a [Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/7/) when my parts come in to mount it.

I use my Android phone and a 1/8"" cable to pipe sound from the headphone jack on the phone to the stock Aux jack under the dash.

I use Winamp and Pandora for music, and Audible and TED for spoken word... I spend better than 2 hours a day in the truck. 

Anything I send in through the Aux jack is pretty lame in volume.  I can't really even listen to TED talks on the highway because the road noise totally blows out the sound.  Even sitting still, with the volume on my device and the volume on the radio turned up full, I can still have a normal conversation in the truck.  Music isn't much better.

I need to figure out how to get more volume out of things.  I know I can use Audacity to bump up the gain on the weak MP3s I get from Amazon, but I'd have to do that for every song I download?

I don't have the funds for a new stereo in the truck.  I can barely afford to feed it as it is.  Is there some plug-in preamp or something I can use between the phone and the Aux jack?  Should I look at Bluetooth?

Any ideas?

I just got done removing a JVC 800BT and replaced it with the pioneer. To give you a brief run down - pioneer to helix B2 to DLS gothias is what is hooked up so far. Right now i have it in passive mode (waiting for tweeter amp to run active). Front HPF at 63 hz with 6 db slope, eq tuned relatively flat, Faded about 80% to the front. After messing with the time alignment by ear and hitting that ""sweet spot"" i can honestly say this thing is fucking nuts. Im sure its a combination of actually having a good head unit and a pricey front stage but honestly this is no joke. For a single DIN at $280 this thing just blows me away. I HIGHLY recommend this head unit to ANYONE. The plethora of settings for just the BASIC mode is ridiculous, never mind the 3way mode which will keep me busy for days. Compared to the JVC there was a night a day difference between sound quality. The JVC was very harsh sounding in the 4-5 khz range and with the limited options i wasnt able to fix it. I can gladly say i don't have this issue at all with the pioneer but even if a did the 16 band eq is more then enough to shape that out. The imaging is near perfect for a passive setup. I couldnt be more pleased. I have used probably 30-40 different head units and i can honestly say this guy is up there in the top 3 for a tuner/sq head unit.

http://imgur.com/a/y75ER

So, last week I posted some boxes I had been messing around with in Google Sketchup.  I just finished a quarter wave box for my Polk DB1040, which I have been running sealed for about a year now.  It's being powered by a Polk PA330, which is giving the sub 200 watts.  All in all, I was satisfied with how it sounded in the small sealed box, but I had been reading up on quarter wave theory, and it caught my interest.  I honestly didn't know what to expect when I put it in, but all I can say is woah.  It is unbelievably loud!  I'm still in shock I think at how loud this enclosure actually gets.  I haven't made any adjustments to the amp yet, I'll wait for the sun to come back out, but off of first impressions, I'm floored.  I've got a neighbor with 2 P3's off a Rockford T1000, and he's running sealed.  I let him listen to the new setup, and he turned green with jealousy!  He thinks my 1 10"" is as loud as his 2 12's.  I think that's a bit optimistic, but close!  What does carAV think?

edit: I should probably add the rest of my system here, too:

This is in fact my second time working with fiberglass and am not that experienced with it, though I have a pretty good idea of how to go about handling it.

My question to you CarAV is... Should I paint it.. or go about some other method of covering it? There are lots of different types of material that can be used to cover the panels but I was hoping to get an opinion.

I was a senior in college.  I had just gotten done with the internship of a lifetime, saved a massive amount of loot and decided to put a high fidelity audio system in my 2003 2 door Honda civic.  

During the selection process I had decided from reviews and from friends experiences to go Alpine for everything.  I was not interested in pounding bass from a subwoofer but sought incredible ear splitting quality. 

My set up was awesome.  
[Alpine CDA-9887](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/cda-9887/)
[SPR-60C](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/spr-60c) front speakers
[SPR-69](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/spr-69) rear speakers
[PDX-F4](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/pdx-f4) Four Channel Amp 
I took full advantage of the imprint system with this [KTX-100EQ](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/ktx-100eq-1/)

I had it professionally installed and I definetly spent a pretty penny on the set up.  I did the imprint system myself and LOVED it.  I am sure some hearing damage resulted but what can you expect.  The clarity was incredible and I had an awesome time with the system.  REALLY obvious discrepencies in quality between CDs and iPod connections.  I absolutely loved that head unit and was tickled pink.

Anywhoo to the sad part.  I was woken up on the morning after my birthday, to a police officer knocking on the door of my apartment.  Panick instantly set in. *What did I do last night that I don't remember?* After answering the door I learned he was there because my car had been broken into early that morning.  This was a despicable smash and grab theft.  They smashed the window, ripped out not just my deck but the whole center console/climate controls.  They ripped the wires out of my amp but thankfully they did not have the correct screwdriver to remove the amp from my trunk mat.  To top it off I lived in Michigan and my birthday is in January, my car has a smashed window and I could not even turn on the heat.  

That was a sad sad day.

One of the 3"" diameter speakers blew recently and most of the family members mentioned it to me to see what i could do. Finding the specific speaker for the boat, i feel, would be a pain. Not to mention, you can only really hear the music in one specific spot of the boat. 

What i would like to do, is replace the stock headunit with something nicer (bluetooth enabled iphone/droid compatable), put two speakers up front on the opposite sides of the boat, two in the back seat, and then possibly (power permitting) two more where the stock speakers are.

The boat is pushed by an outboard motor (somewhere between 50-100  HP), with the battery mounted outside on a small little panel in a water tight case. It's a small battery, maybe about 3/4 the size of an average car battery which leads me to think that i wont be able to put much demand on this battery.

I realize this will require some serious fabrication work, but i fabricated my rear deck in my car from scratch and i think i can tackle it. 

Does anyone have any experience with anything like this, or would like to suggest what speakers / headunit i should use?
i was thinking something along the lines of 4"" speakers in the front, and 6x9's in the back

EDIT: if at all possible i would like to not use an amplifier to power these speakers

https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1043922_10152922542150123_476525342_n.jpg
Hardly a sports car, but insanely practical and loads of space inside for transporting my band/equipment around in.  Super comfy too, as my back doesn't agree with the way you sit in normal cars, the taller sitting position in this is great.  

I pulled out the stock stereo only to be left with a larger than standard size hole, which was going to be a big issue a bit later on.  My first problem to overcome was how to blend the stereo into the much bigger hole in the dashboard.  I didn't want to spend a fiver on a fascia adapter when I had the stock stereo with a perfectly shaped face on it.  Out came the jig saw and I was left with this a few minutes later:
https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1045210_10152926389685123_1444534875_n.jpg

With that done (mostly), I turned my attention to sizing the slot down to standard DIN size.  I found some old plywood and took my jigsaw to it, and made myself an adapter to be screwed into the dashboard to fit the stereo cage into.  Luckily, Renault aren't complete tossers and use the standard ISO plug for their stereos, bar the exception of having to cut the phone-mute cable as it was putting the stereo into mute mode.  At some point I'm going to pick up the twenty quid adapter to get the steering wheel controls working.  It looked like this upon initial fitting:
https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/179746_10152926698605123_1290329172_n.jpg

Because the fascia itself is very curved, I decided to use the stereo-surround set into the fascia to clean up the appearance.  I opened out the cut in the fascia some more, until everything slot together like so:
https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/1010768_10152926699665123_1356676123_n.jpg

I've spent no money so far on this install, as I had the stereo from my old car and I had the wood, screws, and tools already lying around.  I fed my iPod wire out from under the dash, but in the process the two wires spliced into the loom behind the stereo got disconnected some way, so my iPod no longer charges.  I'll fix it when I get around to ordering the steering wheel control adapter.  

Just saying there's no need to spend a shit-ton of money when you can make do with things you already have a lot of the time. 

One of the super-cool things about this car (besides the other awesome stuff) is that there's a simple valve in the front of the lidded cubby hole just in front of the gear stick.  When this valve is opened, the car's heating system is pumped into the cubby box.  In the summer with the AC on, it chills your drinks or food, and in the winter with the heating on, it warms whatever is in there.  Pure genius.

It will have two 6.5"" marine quality speakers and inside the box will be a 2 x 75 watt car amp. The internal wiring will be simple, it's the connectors to the outside that are bugging me.

I want to be able to have a simple interface for iPod/phone audio in, as well as a quick and easy power/ground plug for the amp.  

It's going to be mounted on a rental van roof and the power will end at alligator clips on the battery. That's the current plan at least.

I am stuck at designing what connectors will be on the box for speaker and power.  I'd like to have two RCA female plugs for left and right speakers, and then something super easy for power, like a two pronged lamp plug (like a home outlet) that doesn't let you plug it in the wrong way (cause one prong is wider than the other).

If anyone has any thoughts on what and where to buy stuff like that or maybe even a better suggestion.. I'm ALL ears. 

[EDIT] So I'm thinking I could use a single home outlet [like this](http://www.remodelista.com/products/leviton-688-w-1-gang-recessed-single-receptacle) and then just use two pronged extension cords to get to the car battery and attach the wires directly or with alligator clips.

The primary reason for this is that I have a 2005 Mustang and don't want to sacrifice too much trunk space just for my sound system but at the same time I don't want to limit my subwoofer options. Sure I could get a pre-fab enclosure to fit behind the rear wheel wells but where's the fun in that?!? Plus nothing that's commercially available puts out the power I want so, like most of the stuff in my life, I figure I might as well custom fab it.

So being pretty new to fiberglass work I did some searching and came across this instructables link (among other links... but I did the research months ago but just had this link saved):  
http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Fiberglass-Subwoofer-Box/

I guess at this point I'm curious what the pros and cons of a fiberglass enclosures like these are. If done right (avoiding sharp angles, enough fiberglass for a rigid case, etc) is there any drawback to doing something like this over a more traditional MDF enclosure?

______________________
At the end of the day my plan is to create 2 assemblies:

One assembly would consist of a sealed subwoofer enclosure which would sit behind the passenger side rear tire and hold a 10"" or 12"" sub. This enclosure would extend forward to the front of the trunk with a cutout for a flush mounted amp (The amp enclosure would be heavily insulated against vibrations from the subwoofer). The sub enclosure would definitely be fiberglass to contour to the shape of the trunk space... but the part that extends forward may be MDF covered in carpet to give a clean appearance.

The other assembly would essentially be a mirror of the first, except it would house two amps (one amp for the 4x speakers, one amp for the 2x mid-range door subwoofers). This could be done entirely in MDF since the amps don't need a sealed enclosure.",,False,self,t5_2t73y,False,,,True,t3_1b7ukz,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/1b7ukz/home_fab_fiberglass_sub_enclosure_pros_vs_cons/,

I do mainly podcasts, audiobooks, bluetooth phone calls and some pandora.  I got this head unit: Dual XDMA6415 200-Watt  
  
This was fine and all, but for listening to podcasts, I would have to jack the volume up to almost 45 out of 45 while using my Nexus 4 BT (yes my output volume was turned all the way up).  
  
In any case, I figure, I'm old, have some spare cash, why not upgrade to get for loud, clean, clear setup?  So I do some research, and decide to by some component speakers:  
  
4xJBL GTO638 6.5-Inch 3-Way Speakers (~$150)  
  
And an amp to get the volume up just in case:  
Rockford Fosgate P400-4 400 Watt 4-Channel Amp (~$170)  
  
I figured I should get a pretty good sound after the investment.  I pay a local shop to do the install (~$200).  Prob could have paid less, but it was fast, close and I value convenience.  
  
Get the install done ('98 Durango, amp in the back compartment), fire it up, and I'm thinking ""This sounds kind of ok, but not worth the money.""  The highs are really distorted, very little mid range or base.  I expected a decent sound from component speakers, not overly bright.  I adjusted the EQ on the deck, treble all the way down (-6), base up (+2), sounds better but not great by any means.  The volume is noticeably louder though.  Drive for a few minutes back home, and that was that.  Well today, I drive to work for the first time, and the volume doesn't sound better than pre-amp, and the sound quality is crap.  It sounds worse than before I installed anything (before wasn't terrible, just soft).  Now I'm thinking I just wasted a bunch of money, and I don't know what to do.  
  
Here are  the questions:  
  
Is the deck I have too terrible (It honestly sounded fine before with stock speakers, I just wanted a boost)?  
  
Are my settings off somewhere?  
  
Did I purchase the wrong amp/speaker combo?  
  
Did I get bad equipment (doesn't seem likely)?  
  
Or did I get a bad install?  
  
I don't know where to start.  I'm going to take it back to the installer for help, but I want to know what to ask them...Where do I start troubleshooting?  

Bonus question: I lost the ability to fade front to rear, and I'm assuming this is because the amp uses the front signal only.  Is this correct?  
  
tl;dr  
Spent $500+ and ended up horrible sound.  What do I do?

I have an amplifier that keeps going into protection mode and I am trying to figure out why.

My system consists of 4 Polk Audio speakers in the doors of my vehicle, with a Kenwood svc, 4 ohm 10 inch sub woofer in the back.  I have a MB quart ONX 4.80/500 5 channel amplifier powering those, and my deck is a Kenwood KDC-X396.  I just hooked all this stuff up about 25 days ago.  

Everything was working beautifully until last night, when I started my car and I started hearing popping noises coming from the sub woofer.  I turned the sub level very low, and it just made a popping/scratching noise.  Also something to note, when the sub would make the popping noise, my vehicles interior and exterior lights would dim at the same time.  After about 5 seconds, the amp went into protect mode.  I then unplugged the sub rca's and started the car again.  The speakers played music fine for about 3 minutes, then the amp went into protection mode again.

So next I tested my sub woofer and its wiring:  the wiring is fine, the sub reads 4 ohm with a multimeter, it pops up and down correctly when connected to a 9 volt battery, so I think the sub woofer is fine, though I don't have a way to hook it up to another amp to see if it plays.

Today, I disconnected everything from the amp except the remote wire and the power wires.  Again, after a few minutes the amp went in to protection mode.  My ground seems fine, because it is reading the same voltage as the amp terminals.

I am starting to wonder if either my amp is bad, or if my battery/alternator are bad.  I am not sure what voltage numbers I should be looking for when testing the alternator and battery, as well as the amp. Could that cause an amp to go into protect mode?  The other thing I have not double checked is the deck's grounding.  I'm not really sure what else to check other then those things, so if you have any ideas or wisdom please chime in!

The worse annoying noise though is a humming noise that comes from the speakers when the stereo is turned on, and it gets louder or more high pitched based on how much the car is accelerating.

Since much of the fiberglassing process happens primarily IN the vehicle, especially if I'm not going to be painting anything, and I'm limited on space to work on things, this might actually be able to work given my situation.

I also know I don't have everything it takes to just GO with it, so here goes:

When using the onboard USB ports to play music from an iphone the HU will automatically switch to Pandora if pandora is running in the background on the phone even if it is not being used to play music and the phone's own ""ipod"" application is actively playing music. Meaning you must go through the whole song and dance of killing off the background pandora application every time you want to listen to your own music or podcasts or whatever. On top of that the head unit will automatically initiate a bluetooth audio connection with any paired phone which supports such a connection, even if you disable bluetooth audio on the headunit. This means that when playing music from a USB attached phone the phone will automatically start streaming audio over bluetooth which won't play over the stereo without manually switching the HU to the bluetooth audio input which of course doesn't support any of the meta data display or other ipod/pandora controls OR you can fiddle with your phone to force it to send audio back to the dock connector. 

Bottom line; if you are like me and use your iphone as your primary input for car audio you will be very very very frustrated with the PRS80 unless you never play pandora and always keep your bluetooth disable and never need handsfree while driving.

No matter what i threw at it I was just blown away by the detail and clarity even off the stock HU (temporary). That is ofcourse until 1 of the tweeters started to distort bad, which then became a permanent thing. Unfortunately, this was only after 3 hours of moderate level. So i was really bummed out about it especially since these arent cheap and i was out of the warranty period. So i contacted a guy named Gunnar at DLS who helped me out a great deal in the past and explained my situation and asked what the cost of replacement would be. Well he replied with ""Hi Devin, Sorry to hear about your problem with the tweeter.
I think I can help you and send a new tweeter with UPS or DHL.
Please give me your full address and phone number and I send you a new Gothia 1 as warranty!"". I originally bought these from the official DLS online store so i just wanted to let other car audio enthusiasts know that A: it IS worth it to buy from the manufacturer even if it costs a little more and B: amazing customer service truly still exists now a days and i couldn't be more happier about this.

They did not do a great job with wiring the amps, though neat and tidy it was far from optimal. This left me wondering about the box they made me.

I have one JL 12W6v1 (6ohm DVC) being pushed by a PG zx500.2 @3ohms. 12W6v1 has the following specs: http://mediacdn.jlaudio.com/media/mfg/9013/media_document/live_1/8_12W6_BDS.pdf?1317790304

Forgive my laymans terms, I'll do my best to describe the box. 

It is a total of 36"" long, by 15"" tall, by 10"" deep. Sub sits in the middle, in a chamber that is 12"" long, 13.5"" tall, and 6"" deep. On both sides of this chamber are 2 other chambers that are 10.5 long by 13.5 tall and 6"" deep. They are separated by MDF with 2 4""diameter holes into each chamber. The chamber on the right has a 2"" hole in the ""floor"" that passes into the final bottom chamber, that runs the entire length of the box and is 2"" deep and exits the left of the box. It is the full width and length of the box, 2"" deep.

It doesn't sound terrible, but it seems to lack low end (an area i remember this system shinin in other cars) and doesn't seem to have the thump I remember. Does it seem decent? Or should I start looking for a replacement? Is it super weird to have a chamber on the left of the speaker that doesn't dump into the port?

I've done just an absolutely horrible job illustrating this on my picture. For reference, the RED is the exterior, the YELLOW is the main chamber width, and the BLUE should show the dual chambers. The RIGHT chamber has a 2"" opening the width of it to a bottom chamber (GREEN) that runs the length of the box and exits the LEFT.

In my current vehicle I have an aftermarket head unit with 10"" sub. From having my setup for close to 1 1/2 years I really can't see myself without an upgraded sound system. I'm trying to achieve having an amp (I believe 4-channel) power aftermarket speakers and the subwoofer I have now.

My problem: The 2012 Ford Focus has been known to be a pain in the arse about aftermarket equipment; from drilling out rivets to only 1 or 2 head unit dash kits. I don't want to replace the mediocre audio just to improve quality but lose the great features that Sync and the stock radio provide. 

My solution: Would it be possible to run one of the speaker wire sets (any one of the stock speaker wires) to an adapter or simply convert them to rca/headphone jack and plug into my aftermarket radio (removed to put in new car in glovebox or some other area out of the way) then run audio out from aftermarket radio to amp in trunk which would go to speakers and subwoofer?

Pros: Do not have to remove stock radio, maintain control of audio and not lose features, can set and adjust equalizer presets on aftermarket HU (audio control), it wouldn't cost too much money speaking I already have most of the expensive equipment, and having fun setting it all up.

Cons: Questionable audio quality (depends if you guys know a way to get best sound from stock radio)

Ultimately I have decided to take /u/nagaina's advice on installing the JBL MS-8 processor and I'll probably have some Sony crap with bluetooth for my head unit. But that is not why I'm here.

I've read a lot of posts on here about staging. Currently I'm running a traditional 4 speaker setup (JBL P462s in the front, JBL 608c's in the rear) and in less than three months I have blown the front speakers. I suspect it was a combination of running them 10W RMS over what their stated RMS is, coupled with the type of music I usually listen to (bassline-heavy jams). Ultimately I feel that driver size is limiting me in having SQ up front where it counts. The problem is I am limited in where I can place larger drivers up front- I could fab something custom in my door panels, but that's about it. So I come to you guys for your opinion.

Where do I start with a front sound stage, and what speakers would you recommend? Seeing as the only things I'll be keeping are my subwoofer amp (Alpine MRP-M500), sub (Memphis 15-SC12D4), and the rear speakers (which will get moved somewhere up front) I'm pretty much at the same place I was when I started designing my system. At this point money is not an object as I tried to get around the dollar issue last time and it kinda bit me in the ass. I would like this to be the last time I spend money on this stage of my car.

I'll also be connecting my [2x12's via Rockford P1's ](http://www.amazon.com/Rockford-Fosgate-Punch-Stage-1-P112S8/dp/B0007WW74S) in a ported box, but I'm not sure of what amp to upgrade to or my needed power/ohm/everything else. 

I'm still undecided on what HU to go with, as everything is stock.

So the question, besides any recommendations for HU's(just need usb/AUX and under $150), is at what point do I need to consider the Big 3? Is there a rule of thumb where, under a certain output/amp/wattage/ohm/whatever, the upgrade is it not needed?

I'm upgrading from what I've got now, 860 watts RMS (1x JL 10w6 on a 500 watt JL amp, and a set of 5.25 and 6x9 JL C2s running on a JL 360/4)

Right now my alternator is going out of tolerances at high volume/high bass and spiking electricity.  My solution to this was to buy another 10w6 and a bigger (1000w amp) to bump up the system to 1360 watts.  Needless to say, this really isn't a solution.  Well, it is, just not for my power problems. 

I've already upgraded my battery (yellow top) and the headlights aren't (yet?) dimming, no tv's or anything crazy but I have a 7"" dvd/touchscreen AVH-P4400BH just to give you an idea of how much power I'm using.  I think this will be it as far as audio/video for my car so don't need any room for growth above this.

Car is a 2005 Mazda RX-8.

Thoughts on what I need to do and brands to go with or places to buy stuff?  Right now its looking like upgraded alternator and wiring.  Not sure where to go to get this.

To make matters more complicated, I'm stationed in Germany so anything I buy needs to be able to be shipped to an APO.  I have professional installers here, so I'm not doing this myself but even they aren't telling me to buy from them because stuff is stupid expensive here.

Thoughts?

Height-           14""
Width-            19""
Base depth-     16""      (its a hatchback box)
Top depth-       9""
Port diameter-   3""

Front panel ~ 15.5"" X 19""

3/4"" MDF

Will run off 150 watts RMS for now.

In lots of designs I see, they recommend doubling up on MDF boards for the front panel (the piece the subwoofer sits in).  

Should I do that for my box?  It would make sense since its a fairly large piece for the front.   I understand it is for the structural integrity and keeping the driver in place, but as an alternative I was thinking of putting in a support strut or screwing on scrap MDF to where the subwoofer screws go to give them some extra hold.  I would rather not double up on the front since my design is completed otherwise.

In addition, I may be putting in a new amp in a while to push it at 300 watts RMS, which I figure would stress the box more.  So any tips on improving the structural integrity (if needed) would be great. 

I'd appreciate any input.

*Give me a bit to get up links for these.

I know that my choice in head unit may not have been the greatest, but I am going to be sticking with that.

My Questions:

What is the best way to go about improving my front speakers sound output? They simply get overpowered by the rear speakers. My idea is to either drop a 5.25 speaker or a 6.5 speaker into the front door. I just need to find the right adapter (if possible) to fit the 4x6 stock mount. After reading a bit, i now understand the 4x6 speakers are never going to give me the sound I really want. 

Also, I have had some issues with my head unit recently. The way I have it wired is so that when I turn of the car and remove the keys from the ignition, the head unit will keep on. Recently I have been having it cut out and back on again rapidly if it goes past a certain volume. This sounds like a short to me, but I would not no where to start looking for the problem. Also, I did fix a problem where the head unit would cut out when I was driving because the 4 gauge wire running to the battery had become lose and intermittent to the battery was not charging itself properly. NOTE: I honestly haven't tried and seen if the head unit has had problems since i fixed the whole battery thing. 

One last thing, as I have listened more and more to my system and toyed with it, I hated how my rear speakers were mounted...
The factory speaker mounts are what I am currently using and I had to modify them a bit to fit the new ones. However, the right side one had a little rattle and I need a good set of 6x9 brackets to replace the shitty stock ones. I mistakenly ordered the wrong mounting brackets and do not want to fuck up again. NOTE: I did get some Boom Mat things for the back speakers as well to keep a ton of sound from leaking into the truck, this also requires me to get new rear speaker mount brackets. 

EDIT: Also, with my amp setup, is it possible to run my rear speakers from the amp? or since it it a mono, will only the sub be able to be run? Sorry if this question sounds ridiculous, I am just curious, as people suggests for optimal sound to run speakers from an amp.

Summary:

-Replace 4x6 door speakers with something more loud and crisp &amp; figure out how to mount them.

-Ideas for fixing head unit issues.

-Better way to mount my rear deck 6x9 speakers.  


Please if anything I said sounds ridiculous, I am down to be taught something, car audio has become something I have become really interested in, but as this is only my first time, I have a shitload to learn.

1359921963.0,5,self.CarAV,17tlw1,Further input on my ongoing setup.,soul_justice,6,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/17tlw1/further_input_on_my_ongoing_setup/,"I thought I would try dipping my foot in the water here again for advice, disregarding the somewhat nasty experience I had last time I posted in here. Anyway....on to my setup.

First and foremost I am not trying to bankrupt myself, I just want a decent quality system. I will not be in any type of competition but I enjoy the quality of my music. My main concern is based around upgrading my head unit but I need to point some other things out as well with my setup...

I have an Optima Redtop battery and a 94A output alternator. I completed my Big 3 upgrade this weekend with high-strand 0GA wire. I have two amps. The first is a Kenwood KAC-2404 4 Channel amp @ 30A feeding my four speakers. The rear speakers are currently some 5 way kenwoods but I am about to swap those out for some Soundstream coaxial 6x9s with outboard crossovers. The dash speakers are a moot point as I have minimal room to put speakers in there, and no room to modify for a deeper magnet. They will most likely remain in the form of the current Kenwood 4x6s.

My second amp is an Alpine MRP-M500 @ 60A feeding a Memphis MRClass 12"" DVC subwoofer. The voice coils are 4 ohm, I have them wired to drop the load at the amp to 2 ohms. I have a 1 farad capacitor in before the power distribution block as well. My power wire (4GA) goes into the distro block, and splits off into two 8GA leads. Both leads are less than 5'. I have proper grounding. Since the car this stuff is in is getting restored, I also have some carpet on order with mass backing and a 100 sq ft roll of 45 mil sound deadening.

Now that we're past all that... in my last question I posted here someone recommended I pick up a Pioneer DEH-80PRS. I did some research on it and I like the unit, and it'll keep me from buying an outboard eq or processing unit. However, the outputs on it are 5V, and my amps accept up to 4V. Is there a way to step the voltage down? I don't want to replace my amps just because I'm replacing my head unit, as that will take away from my funds I've put aside in other areas of this restoration. And what else would you recommend I do? Aside from saving up the funds to get some much higher-end speakers in the future I don't know of what else I can do. I haven't noticed much of a voltage drop in my system since the Big 3 upgrade but my lights do dim a little at night...nothing drastic, but would you recommend a HO alternator or another battery?

Essentially once I am done with my restoration, I want people to see my car and say ""That's a nice ride"", but when they sit inside and listen to the music, I want them (and myself) to be blown away, every time. I listen to a wide variety of music, including (older) country, rock, hip hop, metal, and occasionally electronic.

Sound Deadening is the act of reducing cabin noise in your automobile.  For example, you could apply Dynamat to your doors, trunk, wheel wells, floor, ceiling, and notice a reduction in noise in the cabin.

There is a lot of theories as to 'whats the most bang for your buck', comparing do it yourself home supplies to name brand Dynamat.  Most agree that Doors, Trunk, Wheel Wells, Floor, Cieling, in that order, will give you the biggest return per investment.

Sound deadening is actually just stopping vibrations and bolts from rattling.  You can go a step further and include foam inserts just like you would put insulation in a house, this insulation also reduces noise.

My Plan:  I have a 2013 BRZ and I've found road noise can change significantly based on quality of asphalt, rough roads vs brand new pavement.  I plan to purchase Dynamat or another equivalent to put on the wheel wells and see what kind of reduction I see.

I also know that, in order to build a good speaker, you have to think about chassis, the enclosure, the dampening… all that stuff.

But:

If you go and buy a Porsche Panamera and pay 5000€ extra for the Burmester car stereo option,
you get a motorized concert hall with 16 chassis. For home hifi purposes, you´d have to invest at least 8 times the money - and that´s for used components, because Burmester would like to sell you their new stuff for more than a 100 grand (for only a pair of passive speakers, that is) and if you´re unlucky, the sound is not nearly half as good because of your shitty room acoustics. And to add to that, it would be more expensive than the Porsche with the better stereo.

Additionally, I don´t think that so many people out there go and buy car hifi over home hifi, because the work you have to do in order to get a better car stereo is way more complex and time consuming;
and you cannot really enjoy listening your music while dealing with the occasional douche to cut you or to miss the green light twice in a row while being in front of you. Does somebody have a little insight to share with me on that?

I can see why as it's much maligned HU due to it's claim of smartphone support falling far short of expectations and it's niche audience combined with its price.  Nevertheless, seeing how most reputable HUs with nav cost upwards of $800 and not wanting to have to pay for map updates(not to mention 6 month old POIs!) combined with my love of all things Android and this being the only HU on the market with deep Android intergration, I decided to take the plunge.  Here's my impressions over a week. 

I have an android phone with HDMI out and is listed on the Pioneer as supported(Optimus 2x,I'm not a 1%er with a SGSIII!).The Pioneer AppRadio app works...kinda. Probably due to how I wired my Microrelay, while the ""Set/Unset/Set parking brake"" prompt goes away, the ""No video watching in the front"" popup intermittently pops up. And the Pioneer app significantly restricts access to the phone interface(and for good reason!) when the parking brake is disengaged. 

 [ARLiberator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kyle.arliberator&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5reWxlLmFybGliZXJhdG9yIl0) fixes all that and more. While the cost is very steep, the app suppresses the ""No video watching in the front"" messages, is feature complete in comparison to the Pioneer app and even has multiouch over the Pioneer app! Once you install the app, the AppRadio2 lives up to it's potential. No longer do I have to put up with my phone's flaky GPS and the big 7 inch screen is a treat!   

iOS compatibility, as [cnet](http://reviews.cnet.com/in-dash-car-stereos/pioneer-appradio-2-sph/4505-6729_7-35149836.html) stated, is perfect. However, from what I've seen on the iOS App Store, the iPhone 4S and 5 with iOS6 have issues(the 5's issue being Lightning and not Pioneer). My iPod Touch 4th gen with iOS6 works just fine. So does my friend's 4S with iOS5.

Pros:
Stylish UI and HU design. The UI is clean,elegant and functional while the HU has a very uncluttered button layout with a classy chrome edge. 

Cheaper than the Sony MirrorLink HUs and works on any Android 4.0+ device with HDMI and Bluetooth

Good sound. iPod DAC bypass on that note with bundled cable!

External GPS made available to smartphone

Boots up very fast(I can believe the 12 second to App Mode claim!)

Ambient light sensor for readability in the sun.

iOS App mode works as advertised and is very nifty

Android App mode works provided that...


Cons

...you buy a $29 app.

Useless if you don't have a smartphone with HDMI or a fruit on it(No HD Radio, XM/Sirius, USB audio, A2DP, heck no aux!) 

Android Connectivity kit is highway robbery, I spent $10 for a microHDMI to HDMI cord and a microUSB cable. The SGSIII requires the Samsung MHL adapter, however. 

Kinda pricey considering it's shortcomings.

yeah the 15 inch sub is pretty damned over kill, what size would you guys suggest? I was thinking 10 would be a good size for my car. 

I personally don't like the extreme bass I want to be able to hear everything in my music.

I'm going to install everything myself and do it over the span of two days so that I can get everything placed, connected and cleaned up. I'm a noob to doing that specifically but I do have experience from building computers and home theater setups.

Finished Album Pics: http://imgur.com/a/vYe4I

The install took a while but went well, I did it over the course of 3 weekends. 

First weekend I mounted the subwoofer box which took about 3 hours, it wasn't all that difficult just removing panels and then finding the right bolt and nut for the screwing it to the chassis and then running the speaker wire to my seat.

Second weekend I was hoping to get everything installed but I only managed to get the power wire and ground ran and the left front channel of my speakers tapped (soldered). Getting the speaker wire through the door molex was quite the pain in the ass. Upon disconnecting the negative terminal on my battery I dropped a piece of the (stupid) battery connector and wasn't able to find where it dropped so we had to remove it and put on a new (simple) connector. Overall I ended up spending my entire afternoon until it got dark.

Third weekend, this time equipped with the knowledge of getting the speaker wire through the molex I was able to get it all done and ran from the right side to my seat. I was able to run the wire along the front and came out at the same place as the left speaker wires. I then spent another couple hours figuring out how to plug everything in. 

I don't know if this is okay but with the LOC I tapped into the 12V with the amp power wire and did the same thing for the ground. I twisted the ends together and connected it into the amp, if I have issues I will probably go back and solder it. I used the GTO feature on the LC2i and simply connected the remote out to my amp's remote. LOC turns on from the signal from the speakers which then turns on my amp which saved me from having to run a remote wire.

For the most part my sub and amp install is mostly done I just need to tune the amp, do some cleanup, find a shorter RCA interconnect, and locate some fasteners to lock the trim panels back in place.",,False,self,t5_2t73y,False,,,True,t3_zkoek,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/zkoek/update_subwooferamp_install_ford_escape_xlt_2010/,

I wanted to grab food before going to work yesterday so I got some food at Mcdonalds and sat in my car for 20-30 mins eating and listening to music. I went to fill my car up with gas after work (gas station not even a mile away) and the car barely started, normally it turns over very quickly, you could tell the car was REALLY struggling due to battery (everything dimmed as well). This was at night so my headlights were on while I was filling up.



At the beginning of summer I went to a drive-in and was able to watch an entire movie without my battery dying. 



I have a 800 watt amp for my 2 12's. The amp was off while I was at work. The battery is a Duracell with 725 CCA and 890 CA @ 32F



What am I doing wrong here? Do I need a second battery? I would rather not do that but will if necessary.

The other issue I got to find out was when I turn the car off, heavy heavy bass floods out of the thing for a good 2 seconds or so, this is not awesome.

Unfortunatly the shop I got it put in at was closed when these issues started to arrise, regardless I will be visiting them soon, however in the mean time I was hoping you folks would be able to help me out.

Equipment:

12"" Rockford P2.

Rockford Prime r500-1

Ported rockford box

They assured it me it would work just fine, however all is not, so. Anyways if it'll help I can take some shots of the wiring on the amp/sub I can run up and do that real quick as perhaps a wire is just misplaced or the amps settings incorrect.

Also, I know 0 about car audio really so you may have to explain it like I'm 5. I apologize for that, and thank you in advance for any assistance you can supply.


EDIT: Bleh, neither of the installers were in today (Days off so they don't take appointments), and I work till Monday. So, my next question, is there any possible way I can change the gain myself/check (Fix?) grounds/I already checked if it was the in cabin adjustment, it wasn't, still foghorn bass when I turn off the car? If not, I guess I'll just live with it till I can head in there, also on my drive there and back, the sub didn't cut out once, however, the amp was extremely hot (It wasn't as hot out today/I turned on the AC + had my back seats dropped), my guess is this is a result of the gain also being too high?
P.S This is seriously the nicest subreddit I've come into, you guys are great. Also here's some pictures of the wiring and such, I don't know if seeing it will be able to give you any hints but  it's worth a shot.

Here's the album, http://imgur.com/a/p7Ky5

EDIT2: Dropped the gain down to about 3 now, instead of like 5-6, personally I think it sounds a lot better (Distorts less), I also checked the wiring I could find (I'm shit with this stuff, but I looked at the connection to the battery and such) and readjusted where needed. Heading to work now, so we'll how she sounds on this 30 minute drive, and see if we get a sonic boom when I turn it off again.

Some pro-tips to keep your stuff. Might be common sense, but if the flood of ""is this Legacy better than this Boss?"" threads on every audio forum on the planet let us know, it isn't.


1. Alarm. Alarms will deter all but the most determined scum. A broken window or gouged keyhole sucks but still cheaper and easier than all of it. 



Along with an alarm. Do not get it installed at the same shop everybody else does in your neighborhood. Thieves know their mounting and install methods. I'd recommend yourself, but most newer cars make this an expensive way to turn your ignition system into a brick. 


Do not bump in plainly public, isolated places. Those chicks at the mall do not actually care about your stereo, but johnny crackhead sure does.



If you park on the street do not under any circumstances play loudly coming or leaving home from work. 



Advertisements: This one is the worst. Advertising your local shop, air filter, etc, tells would-be-thieves that you have stuff of value in your car. I've seen Alpine banners on Convertss. Even with an alarm, have fun paying for a new roof. 





Keep stuff out of view. Your 200+ cd player's faceplate comes off. Do it. It keeps a thief from knowing your radio is a loaded Kenwood or a junk Jensen, and without a face, not worth as much effort. The flip to this? Shithead, vindicitive kids just take the face. Have fun paying half your radio for just one part. Hide remotes and cables and ipods. Kill switches too.



If your trunk has cabin access, lock it, remove fuses or plugs from interior release buttons. 





Alarm, some discretion in playing and willing to advertise are the key, really. Especially on already hot ticket cars.

We started with a his 12"" alpine type-r and an amp that could have powered it if he was sold the 4ohm DVC, but that wasn't the case. He lacked depth and response even after a good tune. I looked at his box and realized it was a little small (forgive me I forget the dimension but were talking way out of wack). I decided i would build him a box and not only that we'd make an bass reflex instead of a sealed box. To start, It was the single biggest upgrade. Everything else was nice, but this brought back the depth and not only that it really tightened the sound right up. Just tonight his amp to push 600rms came i and I wasn't sure if he really would notice a jump (estimated we had about 300rms from the first amp).  After the tune again a jump in sound quality, the lows echo in a way i forgot they could do. We rolled up to the back of our place of employment and all the employees poked there head out the door, one said he heard it in the bathroom.

I've seen two ways of testing this so far... One way is to swap completely to another amp that you know is good. The quickest way to check RCA connections however requires absolutely no effort. 
 
This post comes after watching someone pull their whole head unit (not easy in their car) to see if their RCAs are connected. 
 
You'll need a female RCA to female or male 3.5mm connector. You'll also need a 3.5mm barrel connector if the converter was F2M. The last thing you need is a pair of headphones. 
 
Unplug RCA from amp, plug into connector, attach headphones to connector, and put music on the head unit. 
 
If you hear it, you got signal. If you don't, check the HU settings. I use this trick to see if I need to fiddle with HU settings after I run the RCAs. 
 

This takes me under a minute and really saves time. I figured I'd share. Any other good tricks?

I have a 2003 Volkswagen Golf and I'm desperately in need of a new sound system! I have a Sony MEX-BT3900U head deck, which is great so that doesn't need replacing.


I went into an audio store and he recommended the following configuration:

Speakers: Sony XS-GTX1621S - $199

Amp: Sony XM-GTR4A - $349

Sub: Soundstream Stealth 13"" - $499

$129 for cabling and $345 for install.

Total $1,521 NZ = $1,146 US

...which is really more than I want to pay. I'm not confident enough doing my own install so I'll definitely be paying someone to do that.

I was chatting to a friend later and he found this package http://www.jonvy.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=2073 which includes:

- Pioneer TS-W309 12"" Single Voice Coil Subwoofer for Enclosed and Free-Air use 1000W

- 12"" Black Single Subwoofer Box - Quality!

- Pioneer GM-6500F 4 Channel Bridgeable Amplifier (760W)

- Pioneer TS-A1604C 6-1/2"" 2-Way A-Series Component Speaker System

For $499 NZ = $376 USD not including install.

A couple of questions then:

1. How well will each setup compare to each other? I had a chance to try out the aforementioned Sony set up with the Soundstream sub and I was definitely impressed/in love.

2. What other setup will suit me? I listen to mostly electronic music and bassy stuff. Ideally I don't want to have to pay more than $450 USD (--is this reasonable? I'm not interested in super super loud stuff. I live in New Zealand and pretty much everything here is more expensive than in the US, bearing in mind)

Hopefully they have the Pioneer stuff set up in their showroom so I can go and have a listen this week.

Any advice appreciated! Thanks in advance.

My budget: $500. I didn't have much to spend. I am currently paying for a wedding and was in dire need of bass. I drive a lot and the lack of music was killing me. I knew most of this was going to go to a nice head unit. More on this later.

Things I had from my old truck: 

-some junk JVC head unit

-[Rockford fosgate punch 6.5 components.](http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/product_details.aspx?itemid=112892) 

-Rockford fosgate p3d412 subwoofer in a sealed 1.2ft^3 custom enclosure. ( box was designed for my old extended cab s10) 

-[Rockford fosgate p300-1 amp](http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/product_details.aspx?itemid=108231)

I decided anything I did needed to be easily upgraded in the future. This meant not skimping in areas that would give me more work later.

I started off looking for a head unit. I wanted a nice touch screen unit with 3 sets of preamp-outs and ipod control, that fit my budget. I was prepared to spend most of my budget on it. I ended up picking up this unit. [Pioneer-AVH-1400DVD](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_130P1400D/Pioneer-AVH-P1400DVD.html?tp=20217). It gave me everything I wanted and it is modular. I can easily add bluetooth and navigation if I decide to later.
There goes $300 of my budget. [Here it is installed.](http://i.imgur.com/8tKjT.jpg) It even matches all the green lights in the dash. :)

Next up came the front speakers. My 6.5 components wouldn't fit in the factory opening and I wasn't about to cut apart the plastic door panel for speakers I wasn't sure I was keeping. So I traded a friend of mine for [these](http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/product_details.aspx?itemid=112895). I ended up just leaving the stock speakers running off the head unit in the back doors.

So I was left with $200. I still needed a sub that would fit under the rear seat. The P3 just wasn't going to fit without giving up a seat in the back. So I did some searching and found [this.](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-db840DVC-8-Inch-Subwoofer/dp/B0016GV1UU/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t) I figured for $50 I would give it a shot. I should also note that I am a firm believer in a quality well built boxes. I planned out a ported box that would fit perfectly under my rear seat, at about .89cu ft and tuned to ~35hz.
I ended up spending about ~40 on 3/4"" mdf to build the box and amp rack. I used my old RF p300-1 to power it.

I was now at $110. I still needed a wiring kit and the front speakers were dying for more power. I picked up a 1/0 gauge wiring kit on ebay for $40. I order 2 more rca cables for another $20. I was now at $50 for a 4ch amp. 

So I went against my instincts and bought [this.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GSLEE4/ref=oh_o04_s00_i00_details) Can't say I was very proud of my purchase, but honestly after getting it hooked up, it wasn't half bad. It actually felt pretty solid. I don't think I would ever recommend it to anyone and Idk how long it will hold up but whatever It does its job. 

Here is a couple images of the [sub getting fit in the whole I cut](http://i.imgur.com/D0lIR.jpg) and another [test fitting under the back seat.](http://i.imgur.com/xZEQ8.jpg) The box actually sits further back than it looks. I had mounted the amps nicely behind the back seat but sadly I didn't take any pictures.

Final thoughts: 
I am actually very happy with the way everything turned out. The box came out pretty good for being my first ported box build. It provides a nice amount of bass that I was missing. Its not window shattering or anything but it sounds good. Everything went better than I expected. I wish I had taken more pictures, but oh well.

One more thing. I needed a cheap alternative to dynamat for my back wall. I picked a roll of [this up.](http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=100028603&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=100028603&amp;cm_mmc=shopping-_-googlebase-_-D26X-_-100028603) It worked out better than I expected. The slight rattle I had in the back is now gone and the road noise has improved some too. I do have to say that the adhesive was not that great though.

TL;DR: It goes boom boom boom now.

About 2 months ago I bought a '96 Celica which has a pretty epic sound system in it.  Now I have no problems with it, and it does sound pretty sweet.  However, it feels like it isn't sounding as good as it potentially could from what I have heard about the parts which I have installed.  By this I mean that the bass coming from the sub sounds kind of patchy and slaps compared to bass that comes out of your average Hi Fi or home theater system speakers/sub, and a lot of bass seems to go to the 6.5"" speakers which probably contribute to the 'slapping' sound because of a higher frequency of bass? Please correct me if im wrong.  These 6.5"" speakers are installed into the flat piece that comes down over the boot.

This is what I have installed:

* [Sub](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_12269_JBL-W12GTi-MkII.html)
* [Amp](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_9711_Infinity-Reference-1600A.html)
* [6.5"" Speakers](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_17735_JBL-GTO638-GTO-638.html)
* [Head Unit](http://www.jvc.co.nz/assets/pdf-brochure/KD-R616.pdf) Aplogies for the PDF

So to be honest, I have little knowledege about the technicalities surrounding setting up a sound system.  I don't much understand how to work with Watts and Ohms and all that sort of stuff, and if it doesn't take a lot of explaining it would be greatly appreciated in the comments, however anything telling me what is right/wrong or what to do is what I am looking for.

My initial thoughts were that the amp wasn't powerful enough to power the sub and speakers.  I came up with this idea by looking at the sub which is 6 Ohms and 700W rms, and the amp is only 400W at 4 Ohms, and since the resistance figure and wattage on the amp is lower, it lead me to think that the sub needs more juice.  Please do correct me if I am way off track, because I probably am (I failed Physics in my last year at high school).

Anyway, thats basically it.  If any more information is needed just ask, Cheers.

Edit: I should also note that the Amp has a fuse, and shuts everything off when I crank things a bit high.  But that is probably a common thing.",,False,self,t5_2t73y,True,,,True,t3_pkfxe,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/pkfxe/experts_opinion_on_subampspeaker_technicalities/,

A few weeks ago I installed a SA-12 wired to 1 ohm in a ported box tuned to 35hz and a Soundqubed AQ-1200d. I love it. It sounds awesome. Gets loud and low. The thing is... I'm hooked again. I want it louder. I wan't to play with things.

So the question is, what now? I do know that I would like to stick with the same amp and keep spending at a minimum. Do I sell my SA-12 2 ohms and buy 2 SA-12 4ohms?

One of the main problems I have is that the bass seems to cut off and come back randomly, and sometimes its actually not even hitting at all for hours. Could this be my Sub or is it most likely the amplifier? 

Which amplifier would you guys recommend. I just need it to power my sub and give me the most out of my 15 inch Type R.

If it makes a difference I think the amp is connected with a regular L/R Audio cable coming straight from my factory navigation system (not sure the cable was in the car when i bought it used).

* ~~what is the ""data link""?~~

RESOLVED QUESTIONS:

thanks to /u/Goingdef and /u/Atrus96

* set subsonic filter at 5hz less than box tuning
* leave bass boost on zero
* ~~ditch bass knob^1~~
* Keep bass knob

**EDIT 3:** Input Sensitivity

It is my understanding that if you set your gains correctly with a multimeter, then you should set the input sensitivity all the way down. I have also read that the higher the voltage (ex. 2v-8v) the lower the input sensitivity, and the lower the voltage (ex. 100mv-2v) the higher the input sensitivity. The JL gain setting diagram says to set the input sensitivity to ""low,"" so on the amp should I set it to ""100mv-2v"" or ""2v-8v""?

* [Pioneer AVH-X7500BT](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_130X7500BT/Pioneer-AVH-X7500BT.html?tp=20217#details-tab) (4x 14W RMS, 6x 4V preouts)

This is in a 1981 DeLorean, so space is very limited and the listening compartment is well-sealed but small. 3.5""s are the biggest that can fit up front, and I went with 6x9s in the back with the idea of getting reasonable mid- and low-range coverage while avoiding needing to fit in any amps/sub/etc. (Changing speaker sizes is not an option at this point.) I listen primarily to EDM and Jazz, with some rock and orchestral occasionally. i.e. I am not big on boomy, thunderous bass or significant loudness, and even if I was, the DeLorean is way too small for such things. I like it tight and punchy.

Well, my roommate has a 2012 VW eOS, and I'm frustrated that his stock speakers sound better than mine! :D So I've picked up a [Rockford Fosgate PBR300X2](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_575PB300X2/Rockford-Fosgate-Punch-PBR300X2.html?tp=115) (100W RMS x 2 @ 4-Ohm) to boost up the 6x9s and I have a few questions about it.

1. Is it ok to continue driving the front 3.5""s with the head unit (since they're only 35W RMS) while driving the 6x9s with the amp? Will this make setting the gains very difficult/hazardous to the equipment? Are there any other concerns I should be aware of?

2. If this setup is ok, what's the best way to go about setting gains in a mixed setup like this? Should I flatten out my EQ/fader settings beforehand, or leave them as-is since I'm happy with it? Will the amp have a significant difference on the response curve or just on the power?

3. If my discontent ends up being caused by the lack of sub, and not the lack of power to the 6x9s (again, it's a small compartment, so I'm not sure power is the problem), I want to add a [Kenwood KFC-XW800F shallow-mount sub](http://www.crutchfield.com/S-Mqzerjvrsul/p_113XW800F/Kenwood-Excelon-KFC-XW800F.html). It's 50-150W RMS @ 4-Ohm. The PBR300X2 can bridge to 300W RMS @ 4-Ohm -- is this ""too much"" to drive a 150W RMS sub with, or do I just have to be careful to set the gain low? I don't listen at loud levels, but I am not very versed in power analysis.

4. If I add the sub, should I use the bandpass on the HU or the amp (or both...)?

I am putting these connectors on wires to attach to the door speakers.  I ran into the following quirks:

1) the smaller female disconnect seemed to not provide enough room for the thickness of the speaker terminal.  I am not referring to width, but the ~1mm gap that the terminal has to fit in.  I bent the connector slightly to provide room for the terminal.  (I had to do the opposite for the slightly larger positive terminal female spade connector)  Without prior experience, I'm not sure what kind of fit it should be.  I have it where it isn't so loose that you can wiggle it, but it isn't tight enough that it won't come off with a good tug (being careful not to damage the terminal obviously).  Is that how you want the the disconnect to fit on the terminal?  It just seems like such an insignificant amount of surface area to connect to the speaker where everything else is all 14-16 guage wiring with extra secure and thick fittings.

2) I wasn't sure what to do with the wire once you put it through the connector.  I actually fed it into the connector past the crimping point so that the wire also makes some contact with the terminal.  I thought this would be the better connection because there is more surface area touching, but I guess I'm not an EE and don't know.  If I am doing it wrong, please let me know so I can clip the excess wiring.

3) I just crimped the connectors on and covered the crimping point and part of the wire with heat shrink tubing.  Some people say solder, but if I pull on the connector, it feels like the wire would tear first.  I bought a fairly nice crimper.

4) I ran out of wiring when I made it to my fourth door.  I was impatient and bought some convenient Monster wire.  After running that wiring I noticed that it is copper.  My other speaker wires are not copper (silver in color...).  Will this make an audible difference?  It is actually home speaker wire, but it is 14 guage, in very thick plastic, and twisted.  I really wish that I just ordered the same wiring and learned patience.  From what I can tell, because they wiring is high quality, of a similar construction, and Monster, it should be Ok.

The front also includes 1"" Tweeters. The sub is an 8 inch. It came with a 300 watt (total power) Rockford Fosgate Amp to power it all.

I don't listen to anything with heavy or low bass though)

Amp (5 channel): [Kenwood KAC-7005PS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00786XNS0/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A1WRTEG7T8P2CK). 40w RMS x 4 at 4 ohms + 500 RMS x 1 at 2 ohms. Cheaper than my previous options with only 10w less RMS to the speakers (Kenwood KAC-8405)

[KNU Konceptz 4 Gauge Wiring Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050I6KII/ref=ox_sc_act_title_8?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A1NLNJ4Y2QP8Z).

I've read reviews that the front door speakers and rear deck ones don't carry too much bass, but the highs are good. Either way, I'm going to set the HPF and LPF to 150hz regardless, so it should mesh quite nicely.

Final price (before 8.25% tax and some items with shipping) is ~$590. I'm trying to keep sub-total at or around $600. Any and all suggestions are very much appreciated.

SO... My dad gave me his car (2002 Hyundai Accent Sedan) for a while until I can get myself a car.. I probably will be driving his car for like the next year.. BUT the only problem is that the audio is shit. Someone told me it's the ground wiring. So what happens is, when I hit a bump or something, sometimes, the car audio turns off (I have very old speakers, I will change them all to Pioneer speakers in a little). The only way to turn it back on would be either to keep driving and wait, make a hard left turn, or sometimes slam the passenger door.

2002 Hyundai Accent Sedan;

HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO:

Option 1: Ask a shop to rewire the wiring for the audio system, I will purchase brand new Pioneer speakers for them to put in.

Option 2: If someone can help me out with how to do that (above option), I will do it myself, with help from a friend that works at a shop. Like I said above, I will put in the new Pioneer speakers. I will need to know what wires I should buy, that's where I need reddit help.

Option 3: I fix whatever is wrong with it and not change anything and save my money for speakers in my new car (hopefully it will be a BMW M3, haven't decided year yet.)

After some more research, I've come up with the following, but have some questions. I really want to make sure everything is right before I start making purchases. Any help would be appreciated..

~~Someone recommended this [pioneer](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-FH-X700BT-In-Dash-Receiver-Bluetooth/dp/B0091UW7F6) head unit, and I think I'm going to get it.. my concerns: I plan to get an a subwoofer + amp combo as well as maybe get this [powerpack](http://www.amazon.com/Alpine-KTP-445U-4-channel-Power-Amplifier/dp/B003VVYL46/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368057557&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=KTP-445), and with only two sets of preouts, how would I wire up this system- especially since the powerpack has 2 pairs of RCAs. An alternative would be to get an amp for the speakers, thinking about this [pioneer](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-Mobile-GM-D8604-4-Channel-Amplifier/dp/B00A02PG0C/ref=sr_1_2?s=car&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367792309&amp;sr=1-2). In that case, how would the RCAs be wired? Also, I'm assuming there's a big difference between 45w RMS and 100w RMS to each speakers.. considering the speakers I want to get, would it be worth just getting the amp. It just became summer, so I got all the time in the world.. I would enjoy the extra work8)~~


New plan.. [clarion headunit](http://www.amazon.com/Clarion-CX501-Double-DIN-Bluetooth-Receiver/dp/B004KVLB9E/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368079488&amp;sr=1-1) with this [powerpack](http://www.amazon.com/Clarion-Mobile-Electronics-XC1410-4-Channel/dp/B00B43LKV0) for the speakers. Bridge the headunit to run 2 speakers @ 100w; bridge the amp to run other two @ ~150w.. you think that'll suffice for a bumping system?




The speakers I'm thinking about getting are [polk front](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-DB6501-6-5-Inch-Component/dp/B000P0R6LQ) or perhaps [infinity front](http://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Reference-6030cs-6-5-Inch-Component/dp/B002BS5YAA/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368080233&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=infinity+component+speakers+6.5). Which would you guys choose?


Next, back speakers.. either [polk](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-9-Inch-Speakers-Silver/dp/B000P0R6KW/ref=pd_bxgy_e_text_z) or [infinity](http://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Reference-9633cf-Performance-Loudspeaker/dp/B002CMUL30/ref=pd_bxgy_e_text_z)?


Finally, I really like the looks of this [subwoofer](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-TS-W2502D4-Champion-Series-Subwoofer/dp/B002ADO588/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t) and plan to put it into this [box](http://www.amazon.com/Atrend-Series-10-Inch-Subwoofer-Enclosure/dp/B0013MWT9O/ref=pd_sim_e_1), but not sure about an amplifier; I was considering this [amp](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-GM-D8601-Class-Amplifier-Remote/dp/B00A02QLVA/ref=sr_1_10?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367792276&amp;sr=1-10).. I understand with the sub woofer coils hooked up in parallel, I can get a RMS max of 800W at 2ohm but is it really necessary to get every last juice out of the subwoofer? How much power do people usually match up to the speakers specs?  Also this [installation kit](http://www.amazon.com/KnuKonceptz-KCA-Complete-Gauge-Installation/dp/B0050I6KII/ref=pd_sim_e_3) for the amp. Finally, to wire the new speakers, would it be best to run new wires to each speaker and which gauge, or can I just hook the power pack to the wire harness?

Last night it would reset every time I would use my turn signal or turn my high beams on and off. By reset I mean the stereo turns off, the screen puts itself away and then it starts up again and the screen comes out. 


It also has an aftermarket backup camera that works with the stereo that disables all sound occasionally when I put the car into reverse.

Now onto me - I am pretty savvy and can handle most repairs and simple installations.

I recently switched cars and pulled out all of my old car electronics that I installed way back in 2006. The setup was:

JL 1000/1 v1 Monoblock amp that does 1000W RMS at 1-4ohm (somehow it keeps that power the same for all impedances? [Manual](http://mediacdn.shopatron.com/media/mfg/9013/media_document/dev_1/1000_1_MAN.pdf?1317780748))

2x Alpine Type-R 10"" woofers in a ""Dual"" bandpass box...I'm recently realizing that the quality was always crap because of the box, but hey it was very cheap (as in free) at the time I installed it.

My taste in music has evolved over the years, and I am now quite a fan of techno/dubstep and the like, so I want something that will have a better low frequency response. On the other hand, I definitely care about sound quality and range, and I don't need my car to wake the dead or thieves. Additionally, in my old car, I had issues with the headlights dimming, and I wouldn't be surprised if I did a number on the electrical system. I'd like to avoid that in my new car.

Speaking to the electrical issues, I am worried about matching such a high power sub to the 1000W amp. Is my only option for reducing the power draw to sell the amp and buy something less powerful, or can I just simply go with a lower power sub and adjust the gain/lower the bass from the head unit? I am thinking ~800W RMS 15"" in a ported enclosure tuned to 30Hz, but I'm not as informed as you folks. 

tl;dr questions:

Can I go with a lower power sub without worry with my 1000W amp

What sub/enclosure do y'all recommend for decent quality and lows at that range (ideally pre-built, but I'll have some time on my hands soon)

Sidenote, I was never really happy with the sound of the system I put in my old car and was constantly trying to tune it.

I'm installing a new head unit in my 2012 F-150 STX, and I have a few questions I thought I'd ask here before calling crutchfield tech support and bothering them.

Bought this unit - http://www.crutchfield.com/p_105KWR900B/JVC-KW-R900BT.html?tp=5684 

with this harness - http://www.crutchfield.com/p_127C2RFRD1/PAC-Ford-Radio-Replacement-Interface.html?tp=3486

Also have the appropriate mounting bracket / plate and antenna adapter.

I realize I need to solder the stereo's harness to the generic harness, and match the connections up. That shouldn't be a problem, I have wiring diagrams that show what wire is what, so just match the appropriate wires up and join. Easy. I don't understand, however, the 6 av plugs coming out of the harness. It has sub input, rse, and aux, 2 jacks for each (left / right I'm assuming). However, the harness wiring diagram shows front and rear wires on it. Why would the harness have 2 sets of front wires and 2 sets of rear wires?

Also, the sub connection... it looks like the sub jacks should connect to the rear of the head unit, which makes sense, but their connections are green and purple, not red and white, so it doesn't match the head unit's coloring on the sub input jacks. 

All I'm looking to do is to replace the factory head unit, no additional amp/speakers at this time. If I should choose in the future to upgrade these parts, however, I should be able to, right?

So I originally was going to build subs up port to drivers side, but since it was my first box build went subs and port back to make it easy. 

Has been sounding fine but yesterday I needed a bit more trunk space so I flipped my subs around (port and subs firing forward) so they would be out of harms way. 

Forgot to turn them back around when I got in the next time and noticed the kicks sounded tighter. Slid the box all the way back against the rear of the trunk and my kicks are much more intense, bass is nice and deep and seems more balanced with the kicks (but not quite as loud as before), however the upper bass is lacking. Just a lot of vibration in the rear of the car for the most part.

Anyone know of a good after market product that would let me stream audio over bluetooth? Streering wheel controls aren't necessary, but would be nice.

I have an iPhone 5 and was using the AXIPCL2 from Scosche, but this doesn't work with the 30pin to lightning adapter change, and Scosche has advised that 30pin - lightning adapter will not work.

Over spring break, though, I wanted to replace the stock radio in my '01 Honda Accord, and while everything was apart hook up the power and RCA lines for the future amp install.

The two radios I was considering were:

[Alpine CDE-143BT](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_500CDE143B/Alpine-CDE-143BT.html#overview-tab)

[JVC KD-R740BT](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_105KDR740B/JVC-KD-R740BT.html)

Both are $130 which is the upper end of what I'd like to spend, but come with all the installation accessories I'd need and 2-day shipping, which would be really nice to get it before the Easter season starts.

For the other hookups, would [either](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Boss-4-Gauge-Amplifier-Installation-Kit/11968851) of [these](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Pyle-PLAM40-4-Gauge-Amplifier-Installation-Kit/21607394) from Walmart work alright? 

-----

End goal is to set up a set of 12"" subs in my trunk; to do this, I still need an amplifier, head unit, and all the cabling to go between the two and for power.

The two subs are a Kenwood KFC-W3011 and -W3012, with 4 ohm resistance apiece and max power / RMS power of 1200W/400W.  I don't plan on pushing anywhere near that much to them and was hoping to get an inexpensive ~500W RMS amp at some later date. Maybe something like [this](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_33401_JVC-KS-AX3101D.html)? I know /r/CarAV dislikes Boss and Legacy, but for a budget setup where I'm not trying to buy them because they say they're ""3000W!!!powerful!"" would they be functional?

Lately I've had some issues with the electrical system. There was one day my car did not start (seemed really dead) when I tried to turn it over the first time, but then the second try it fired right up. This happened for some time for a few weeks, but it never failed to start the second attempt. During this time my HU (Alpine IDA-X305s) would also cut out, as in lose power for a second and come back on right away. This happened even when I was driving, and the intervals in between the shutoffs would get shorter and shorter until it wouldn't even come all the way on. These two problems made me think the battery was going, as it was just a cheap starting battery.

So, I replaced my battery with an Optima Yellow Top and did the Big 3 upgrade with 1/0 guage. It seemed to fix the problem, but just today the HU started shutting off randomly again. I haven't had starting problems so far, but what would cause this? I would assume the alternator has something to do with it but it's been shutting off when I'm driving even with the sub amps turned completely off and the volume really really low.

I have an '02 Cavalier Z27, and an XPLOD 800w amp.  I have three questions:

1. Is there any constant 12v in the trunk of cavaliers, or do I have to get a side post terminal and string it through the firewall and along the side?  I can't find any constant 12v back there, but I thought I'd ask, just in case I'm making dumb mistakes

2. If I have to run my own wires, can I just run a positive from the battery, and hook the ground up to some metal part of my trunk?  Or would it be best to run both a postive and a ground from the battery?

3. If I have to run my own wires, what gauge would be best?  I was thinking anywhere from 6-4g, but that's just a wild guess.

I posted to /r/Honda and they let me know that I should definitely use an amplifier. What amp do you think would work best for this scenario?

I am a complete noob, I have never installed a system before. The actual process of installing it doesn't look too imposing but I want to make sure I get the components right.

The same guy I got the 6.5s from has a 500W amp but I thought it was too high. I keep hearing different opinions, but keeping the RMS power to each speaker at or below its rated RMS power makes sense to me. Is that not right?

If the two fronts are 75W rms each, and the two rears are 110W rms each, can I use a 4-channel amp to power all four? A 300W amp with 75 watts to each channel?

Recently we had a reasonable amount of snow, a few inches I would say. Ever since then, my car radio has been not quite right. I have tried three seperate aerials, and it's not as if the radio doesn't work, but more the signal is shot.

Essentially, my car will not find any strong enough signal when I scan through the FM channels. It will, reasonable strongly, find the nationwide BBC Radio One signal. When I am driving along, the sound switches from quiet to loud seemingly randomly, as if there is a loss of signal. 

I also have a small FM transmitter for my iPhone, which never had an issue before, but will only create a strong signal when the usb charger is plugged in the bottom. The usb charger doesn't have to be delivering power, but just be plugged in. Otherwise, the transmitter cuts in and out depending on it's orientation at the bottom of the phone, and if I cup my hand around it, the car radio picks it up stronger.

my next step is a set of these [Alpine SPS-610c](http://www.amazon.com/Alpine-SPS-610C-Type-S-Component-Speakers/dp/B004THAWHG/ref=sr_1_11?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361235825&amp;sr=1-11) for mids and highs. i plan to buy these retail instead of waiting around for a set of decent component speakers to pop up on CL.

on the subject of front speakers i have the opportunity to get a [Rockford Fosgate Prime R150-2](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_17366_Rockford-Fosgate-PRIME-R150-2.html) to amp them for around $40

because i'm cheap i'm still browsing CL just for the hell of it and came across a set of these [Kenwood KFC-G1620](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_38734_Kenwood-KFC-G1620.html) for $20 new and unopened. i know a lot of yall don't use rear speakers and say that 6.5s are better than 6x9s would these be worth the price? Unammped? because the alpines are 80rms and these are only 30rms so i'd have to either get a 4 channel amp that only puts out ~30rms and drastically underpower the Alpines or get yet ANOTHER sub just to push these and i'm not really trying to go there.

just for completeness my current amp is a [Kicker KX400.1](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_2853_Kicker-KX400.1-04KX400.1.html) pushing a [Pioneer TS-W257D4](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_8333_Pioneer-TS-W257D4.html)

tl;dr questions: 

*  Are the [Alpine SPS-610c](http://www.amazon.com/Alpine-SPS-610C-Type-S-Component-Speakers/dp/B004THAWHG/ref=sr_1_11?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361235825&amp;sr=1-11) good for a budget component set?

*  is the [Rockford Fosgate Prime R150-2](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_17366_Rockford-Fosgate-PRIME-R150-2.html) a good opportunity buy at $40?

* are the [Kenwood KFC-G1620](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_38734_Kenwood-KFC-G1620.html) a good buy for $20? would they need to be amped to not get drowned out by the sub and alpines? should i just forget about rears? 

* speaking of multi-channel amps, i see the rockford is capable of putting out 50w x2 at 4Ω or 75w x2 at 2Ω... i have a beginners understanding of wiring for impedance with mono amps but how would you wire a 2 channel amp for 2Ω and being that the speakers i plan on amping 4Ω would that even be possible? 

* my next project before adding the second amp is building my own power cables to replace the shitty off the shelf wiring kit i have now. i plan on running 4ga to the distribution block then 8ga to the amps blah blah. would i need a second distribution block for the amp grounds or do i run them separately from each amp to my chassis ground? i know everyone here swears by knukonceptz wire but i'm trying to source as much as i can locally, does anyone know where i would purchase power wire from inexpensively? i tried home depot and lowes but they only had premises and ethernet by the foot, my closest audio shop was closed today and the other one doesn't sell by the foot.

I know Boss has pretty bad reviews on here, but again, price is right.
total for subs and Amp together is 400.00 


The price of Subs/Box/Amp/Speakers includes the wiring, and installation.

I'm assuming since I'll be buying my head unit separate ill be charged for installation on it as well, So I'm looking at around 600 bucks total, maybe a little bit more.

Again, this is just really an intro system for me, I'm aware most of the EQ is entry level, its not meant to be the king of kings, just enough to enjoy my music a little bit louder and cleaner than the average joe.

The sound was good overall but everything deep seemed hollow and weak. So I took it back out to see if different RCA (Red &amp; White) combos would change anything and to my surprise nothing changed.

Help?,balzotheclown,5,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/186n8q/installing_new_stereo_into_97_geo_prizm_help/,"I went out today and bought a new stereo for my 97 Geo Prizm today because I am taking a trip to Chicago tomorrow and figured it would be good if I went ahead and upgraded my system now instead of later. Well, I took out the original factory radio, something I've done before with no problem, and got ready to start the wiring. I had my buddy with me that works in car audio so that he could help out (and by help I mean do most of the work) and we couldn't find the correct wiring harness for it so he was just going to splice the wiring together with the wires for the new stereo. So he cut off the factory harness, far enough back to replace it eventually when I get rid of the car, and set to work. No problem, right?

Well turns out he didn't know which went to which and we couldn't find a proper diagram online for it so we went in search of a proper wiring harness for it. We found one at walmart of all places and got it back to the car. We had to splice the factory harness back onto the wires to attach the new harness, which wasn't a problem and went smoothly. He did that while I prepared the leads from the new stereo to be spliced into the new wiring harness. We got it all ready and plugged the new harness into the old plug and reconnected the battery to test it out. 

Turns out, that shit didn't work. FML, right? So I disconnected the harness and plugged the factory stereo back in to see if it was something wrong with the wiring in the car or the wiring in the harness.

My truck is a regular cab, the only speakers are in the doors. per door there is a "" 6x9"" and a 2"" tweeter [kinda]. Now from a Tacoma forum i discovered the deck has rear speaker outputs that are completely unused. 

my idea is to use the additional speaker outputs to ""bi-amp"" the door speakers. i will be replacing these drivers soon. i don't really see any drawbacks to doing this type of mod. it will provide a bit more power and allow more adjustment from the factory unit.

any thoughts on this? i really don't want to modify this truck, just want to maximize what i have. 

my background : i started in car audio with my brothers car in 1990-91 [i was in junior high]. completed my MECP certification before age 18. was a professional auto mechanic for 12 years. i have built vehicles from the frame up [restoration] and built more than my share of audio systems.",,False,self,t5_2t73y,False,,,True,t3_182mem,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/182mem/optimizing_stock_head_unit_use_2013_tacoma/,

Need some/a lot of guidance. ,sfu_guy,5,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/182djy/modernizing_my_02_explorer_by_adding_blue_tooth/,"Alright so I'll start this off by telling you guys that I know absolutely nothing about car av or electronics. 

My stock head unit is failing on me and I am a poor student so my budget is small but I think I can do a decent job with the stuff I got. Got tools at my disposal and my brains. 

My plan is too purchase a modern head unit first that will blend into the existing dash lighting. 
This pioneer looked good and will pair well with my Android (sgs3):

 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0091UW7F6/ref=mp_s_a_1?qid=1360245976&amp;sr=8-7&amp;pi=SL75

Second thing I would like to do is install a wireless Charing solution for the s3 owners in my family. It involves the palm pre touchstone chargers and charging plates. I would like to velcro the base to somewhere on the dash or near the cup holders but I want the micro usb cable leading into the base to be hidden away and always plugged in. Problem is that the car charging ports in my truck always stay powered and I'm afraid this will kill the battery of it remains plugged in to one of the sockets. Is there any way around this? Another caveat is that it needs at least 2a and will charge with nothing less. I was hoping maybe one of you can tell me how to wire a micro usb cable providing 2.1a power through the dash. Maybe I can drill a small hole wherever the palm base will rest? I can put a picture of my dash up as well just so you guys have a better idea of the layout. 

Here's the teardown of the wireless charging stuff:

http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Palm+Touchstone+Charger+Teardown/810/1

Ok so that's that. I will probably set up a nfc tag to put the phone in car dock mode and activate blue tooth and gps and so on but that's pending I can even get it installed. 

What do I do from here. I have the head unit and the palm stuff on order but I don't really know what else I need. Do I need a double din dash kit? Any wires? Harnesses? What's a harness? Screws? Please help me. I've spent about 160 on everything so far and don't want to spend too much more. Would rather spend money on travelling.

Vehicle: 2005 Nissan Pathfinder

Subs: 12inch JL wxV1

Amp: JL 500w amp

History-

Made my first purchase 4 years, walked into a show room at a local car audio place. I had a small budget and hadn't done any research. 

For around 700 bucks , which i was told would be a cheap entry level set up, I got;

[Eclipse CD1200G dual din stereo](http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_21600_Eclipse-CD1200G.html)

2 12 inch JL W0V1

500 watt JL audio amp

Entry level box enclosure nonported 

To this day I'm not sure if that was a good deal but I was happy with it until this point...  

Anyway along the way over the years I went from the JL w0's to wx's and today one of them has blown. Instead of repeating this process I thought i'd get some advice from you guys before going forward.

I went into the shop again and inquired about replacing the blown 12inch sub. While I was there i was told about another clearance deal.  2 15inch JL w0's that already come in a enclosure. Basically the approach i took when i got my original install.

These 2 15inch JLs would be $235 with the box. I would either use my 500watt amp or get a new 1000watt amp im not sure yet.

Before I go forward what kind of purchasing philosophy would you guys recommend?

Bargin shop online for 2 new 15inch subs and amp then have this shop
install them?

Just replace the 12inch that has blown.

Buy the 2 15s already in a box from the shop.

Or some other approach?

thanks in advance, great sub!

I'm pretty new to this, still learning. When I ordered my stuff, I made the mistake of matching my OHMs incorrectly between my sub and my amp, so I just bought another sub. Life could be worse. 

If I got anything else wrong, please say so.   

I still need to pick up a distribution block. Planning on doing the Big 3 at the same time, just gotta find somewhere locally that sells 0 guage and terminal ends. Car is a 2002 Alero 4 dr with the 2.2 liter 4 cyl. If I read correctly, it's alternator is putting out 105 amps. 

I wasn't planning on putting in sound deadener, but the more I read, the more I think I need it. 

I also want to add an active crossover somewhere down the road, but I have yet to discover the difference between my ass and a hole in the ground.  

I have an experienced installer taking part of his Saturday and part of my wallet to help me install properly. I know my way around a toolbox well enough to change a wheel bearing, but I've never had a good car stereo or installed a car stereo. I don't really want to make any runs to the store if I don't have to during the install, please tell me if I'm forgetting anything.

I bought what I thought was the correct Stalk Unit for the car (it turns out it wasnt despite advice that it should have worked). The back of the Stereo looks like this:
http://i.imgur.com/ejI7xsJh.jpg

The cable I am holding is for the FM aerial (which i now have plugged in and working), the cable plugged in to the top right is for the DAB Radio (which is working). If I plug the cables i got with the new radio straight into the ones from my car (as seen in the top of the pic) the radio will come on, I can scan channels, play FM and DAB radio, play cds etc but when I switch the engine off the new radio stays on for a few minutes and then goes off automatically, also my clock display which shows time, radio station etc doesnt display correctly and it seems to lock the 'open door' messages and the clock stops counting - so it looks like the wiring is the wrong way round somewhere? Also when I switch the car off the stereo goes back to factory settings and doesnt remember any channels and is in default 'demo mode' and my steering wheel controls don't work so there is clearly something amiss.

So before I spend any more money I am hoping for some help, I was thinking I might need to purchase this Stalk Adaptor:

http://www.caraudiodirect.co.uk/con-ctspg006-ctspg006-stalk-adapter-for-peugeot-206-307-406-607-807-.html

and this jvc specific adaptor which plugs into the black  box on that stalk adaptor and then I connect the end of that red cable to the loose wire labelled (steering wheel remote) cable you can see coming out of my new stereo, then maybe plugging that 3.55mm jack into the 3.55mm port labelled ""BT Adaptor/AUX In"" ?

http://www.caraudiodirect.co.uk/con-ctjvclead2-connects2-jvc-stalk-adaptor.html


I feel like I am so close and just need a little bit of guidance to get it right! I have read a few sites suggesting that some of the cables are the wrong way round on the peugeots and need moving around.

I want to mount the subs facing upwards with the wire terminals???(is that the right word) on one side

Questions:

If I buy I can not find a box that fits what is recommended for my subs.

If I build my own box I am good with woodworking/tools/DIY I just have no idea where to start. I'm pretty sure I know the dimensions I want but I dont know how to implement the port into there.

I was thinking top: 18"", height: 15"", width: 25"", bottom: 20"".

Any help would be much apreciated.

I listen to rock and mostly metal; I'm looking for tight, focused bass, not overpowering, sloppy bass. This sub is to reproduce quick kick drum patterns, and to fill in the low end for bass and down tuned guitars. 

If it helps, my current HU is a Sony CDX-GT700HD. My speakers are infinity reference 6.5s in the doors, and 4X6s in the dash. (Side question, should I amp these? My HU puts out 17wattsX4 RMS.) 

My max budget is probably...$300, but I can push it if I need to. 

TL;DR I need a punchy, musical sub  for metal that's enclosure will fit behind the seats of my s10. Around 300 for the amp, sub, and enclosure. 

P.S. active units like this.

Look pretty quick and easy. Do you think that this is what I'm looking for? 

What about this JL? I hear that they are really punchy, and that sealed enclosures are what I'm looking for for musical, tight bass.

It has a double din slot and I've already purchased a 10"" Bazooka tube (100W) for the bass. The stock speakers will be used (unless they are total crap?) I have a Nexus 4 Android phone that I will be pairing with it. 

Here are some features I want:

* Pandora streaming using the Bluetooth link. Must be integrated so I can thumb up/down, etc right from the HU. 
* A good equalizer with time delay correction and crossover slopes.
* DVD video playback w/passenger zone outputs. 
* Good software. None of that Chinese android crap, or Clarion/Alpine/Kenwood (all garbage)
* Navigation a plus
* HD radio if it is built in, I don't want to add an external box

I'm looking at the Pioneer range of navigation units, either the [AVIC-X940BT](http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Car/GPS-Navigation/AVIC-X940BT) or the new [AVH-X5500BHS](http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Car/DVD-Receivers/AVH-X5500BHS). The Pioneer AppRadio looks interesting but I fear it is too basic.

I wouldn't mind going with something less traditional like the [ca-fi](http://ca-fi.com/en/) if it worth it. Not sure the software is up to par on that one. 

Another option is to simply buy a [simple head unit](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/cde-hd137bt) with AUX in and build a custom Android tablet solution. No front and rear speaker controls with that option though. 

Lots of good decks that work with an iPhone but I don't have one of those.
