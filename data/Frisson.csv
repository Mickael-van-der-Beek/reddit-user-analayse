New rules, please read!",girafa,837,114,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/14tk22/putting_the_frisson_back_in_rfrisson_new_rules/,"Love this place, and I hate seeing it teeter like this. So, before /r/frisson [collapses on itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/13q4y1/meta_can_we_please_start_using_descriptive_titles/) and the word becomes a novelty, we're pulling back the reins on this subreddit.

Two Major Changes are Occurring: 

**1 - Descriptive titles are now mandatory**

**2 - Only self-posts are allowed.**

For all the ""karma doesn't mean anything"" talk around reddit, let's put our money where our mouths are and prove it. We're not in /r/frisson for karma. We're in /r/frisson for the *frisson*. 

And let's be [100% clear about what /r/frisson is](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/14rskg/psa_just_what_is_frisson_lets_clear_up_some/):

&gt; a sudden, passing sensation of excitement; a shudder of emotion; thrill.

If it doesn't give you *goosebumps*, and if it doesn't make you *shudder* - **it's not frisson**, and it doesn't belong here. Try /r/aww for happy/cute things or /r/baww for sad things.

Obviously, frisson is subjective. So is moderation. It has to be, nothing is black and white on reddit. Lines get blurred all the time.

This isn't the place to dump instant gratification emotional response images. If you look at an image and say ""that hit me right in the feels"" - it doesn't belong in /r/frisson. If you think it's ""touching,"" it doesn't belong here. 

**If and only if it gives you *frisson* does it belong here.**

--------------------

Descriptive Titles
-

Just like so many other subs, we're going to start enforcing a labeling system. There are two requirements for each submission title. 

The first is to **label what kind of content it is**, chosen from the following categories:

* Text
* Music
* Video
* Image
* Thought
* Comic
* Meta

If it's a music video, use either [music] or [video], we're not going to get that picky. Same with concerts.

Second Requirement for labeling your submission:

**Name the piece and credit it**, if possible.

Then you can write your descriptor about the submission after it.

So, here are examples of how this will work:

[\[music\][Mumford &amp; Sons ""The Cave""] The moment you realize that your band has made it 0:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvG6UrRMFnk)

1363718573.0,615,self.Frisson,1alx5s,[text] Wil Wheaton tells a story about a fan.,jdllama,706,91,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1alx5s/text_wil_wheaton_tells_a_story_about_a_fan/,"&gt;Appearing as a guest at a big convention like MegaCon is a lot of fun, but it’s also exhausting. People always ask me if my arm or hand or wrist is tired near the end of a long day of signing, and I always tell them the truth: my body never gets tired; it’s my brain that is exhausted. Signing is so much more than, well, signing. It’s listening and engaging and sharing moments and meeting hundreds of people in a relatively short amount of time, doing my best to not rush people while understanding that the person in front of me and the person still waiting behind them may have been in that line for over an hour. It’s drawing out shy kids who are excited to meet me, but don’t know what to say. It’s handling people who can be a little strange — if harmless — who may not know when it’s really time for them to move on. It’s telling someone that I’m sorry, but I can’t sign that thing, or I can’t pose for that picture, or I’m really not going to go have beers with you because I don’t know you at all even though you think you know me.

&gt;I suppose I could make it less mentally taxing if I just sat there and didn’t make an effort to engage people or treat them like human beings (and there are some folks who do exactly that), but that’s not how I roll, and I will stop attending conventions before I become That Guy. That Guy has no perspective, no humility, no gratitude, and while I’ve met him a few times (there are a few people who act like fans at conventions are simply meatbags attached to wallets) I won’t ever be him.

&gt;And I wouldn’t have it any other way. Because I was a fan at conventions long before I was a special guest, I know what it’s like to be on that side of the table, and it’s important to me to treat people the way I want to be treated. It’s also wonderful, because I get to meet remarkable and inspiring people, and share in the mutual joy we have for Doctor Who, Tabletop gaming, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Star Trek, beer, hockey, and silly Internet memes.

&gt;This weekend, I met dozens of people who told me that they were scientists, engineers, doctors, or programmers because they were inspired by Wesley Crusher. I met tons of women and a few men who told me that I was their first teenage crush. I met a lot of people, men and women, my age and younger, who thanked me for speaking out about depression and anxiety. I held a young woman’s hands while she cried because her anxiety was so intense and scary, and I promised her that she would be okay. I was moved by her bravery, and inspired by her courage. I met some families who were all geeking out about different things at the convention, from Star Trek to My Little Pony to LEGO to Star Wars, and happily sharing in each other’s joy. I was honored to be part of all of these experiences, and grateful to have them.

&gt;But there is one meeting that stands out, that moved me so much, I’ve been struggling to find the right words to recount it. On Saturday, a young woman walked up to my table with her husband and her two children. She handed me a typed letter and told me that she knew she wouldn’t be able to get through what she wanted to say to me, and would I please read it.

&gt;I unfolded it, and read her story. When she was a young girl, she had a serious complication due to her Lupus, and her doctors told her that she would never walk again. She had a photo of me, though, that she took with her to physical therapy every day, and the therapists would hold it up for her and encourage her to walk toward it — toward me — while she recovered. She made a promise to herself, she said, that she would walk again some day, and if I was ever in her town, she would walk up to meet me. At the end of her letter, she thanked me for being there, so she could *walk* to meet me.

&gt;I looked up at her through tears, and she looked back at me through her own. I stood up, walked around my table, and put about fifteen feet between us. I held my arms open, and asked her to walk over to me. She began to cry, and slowly, confidently closed the distance between us. I embraced her, and we stood there for a minute, surrounded by thousands of people who had no idea what was going on, and cried together.

&gt;“I’m so proud of you,” I said, quietly, “and I am so honored.”

&gt;We wiped the tears away, and I sat back down to sign a photo for her. I looked at her young children. “Your mom is remarkable,” I said, “and I know you don’t get it, because she’s, like your mom? But you have to trust me: she is.”

&gt;The kids nodded, and I could tell that they were a little freaked out by the emotion of the thing, even if they didn’t understand it. They looked at their father, who said, “Mommy’s okay. Mommy’s okay.” That made me tear up again. Mommy was okay, and she is a remarkable woman who defied the odds and her doctors, and *walked* up to meet me. I’m still overwhelmed when I think about what that means, and how I was part of it.

I saw Hole right after they resumed touring after Kurt died.  I was really surprised that they were going to play again so soon, but I was excited for the show.

Turns out, it was the most memorable music performance of my life.

I would love to have the skill with words to put it all down here, but I don't...so I'll just give you the best I can manage.

Hole played an amazing set.  It was an outoor venue, and about halfway through the set, lighters were held high and there were a LOT of people in the audience with tears in their eyes.  I was young then, and I was actually very strongly affected by Kurt's suicide (Nevermind was the first album that *changed* me as a person just from hearing it).

I had blocked it out.  After seeing girls in newly purchased Nirvana shirts lining the halls of my high school, crying and pretending that this had been their favorite band all along....I just felt like it wasn't ok for me to mourn the passing of someone I was so strongly affected by, so I did what any guy does:  Buried it.

Well...things...they have a way of not staying buried.

As Hole played, Courtney just fell apart.  The last 1/4 of their set was much more like watching someone die, than wathing a band play music.  She forgot the words to her own songs.  She alternated from furious to impossibly sad in about 10 second intervals.  

All of a sudden, this rock concert had become the funeral for Kurt that I and probably most of the crowd wanted, but never had.

It ended with Courtney kicking all of the other band members off stage, physically punching a bodygaurd who tried to drag her off stage, and then picking her guitar back up and doing an off the cuff cover of Pennyroyal Tea.

She sang that song like Kurt was sitting there watching it.  It tore her APART coming out of her.  It really was like watching someone tear their own heart out and eat it on stage.

She ended the song a complete wreck, and could barely stand.

The crowd was *silent* except for sobs I could hear all around me.  I noticed I was crying in front of total strangers and didn't even care.

Before she left the stage, she slammed her guitar down on the ground, found the last working microphone (she pretty much destroyed the entire set while the band watched from backstage), and she screamed this to the crowd:

DONT YOU 

EVER

FUCKING

FORGET


And she collapsed, and was carried off stage.

Great, now I have tears in my eyes at work.

But, I had seen too many impoverished people who depended on taxis as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door. This passenger might be someone who needs my assistance, I reasoned to myself. So I walked to the door and knocked. “Just a minute”, answered a frail, elderly voice.
 
After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 90′s stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940′s movie.
By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets.

There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard
box filled with photos and glassware.

‘Would you carry my bag out to the car?’ she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman.

She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb.

She kept thanking me for my kindness. ‘It’s nothing’, I told her.. ‘I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother to be treated.’

‘Oh, you’re such a good boy, she said. When we got in the cab, she gave me an address and then asked, ‘Could you drive
through downtown?’

‘It’s not the shortest way,’ I answered quickly..

‘Oh, I don’t mind,’ she said. ‘I’m in no hurry. I’m on my way to a hospice.

I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. ‘I don’t have any family left,’ she continued in a soft voice..’The doctor says I don’t have very long.’ I quietly reached over and shut off the meter.
‘What route would you like me to take?’ I asked.

For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator.

We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.
Sometimes she’d ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.

As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, ‘I’m tired.Let’s go now’.
We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.

Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move.

They must have been expecting her.

I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.
‘How much do I owe you?’ She asked, reaching into her purse.

‘Nothing,’ I said

‘You have to make a living,’ she answered.

‘There are other passengers,’ I responded.

Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug.She held onto me tightly.

‘You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,’ she said. ‘Thank you.’

I squeezed her hand, and then walked into the dim morning light.. Behind me, a door shut.It was the sound of the closing of a life..

I didn’t pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly lost in thought. For the rest of that day,I could hardly talk.What if that woman had gotten an angry driver,or one who was impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away?

On a quick review, I don’t think that I have done anything more important in my life.

We’re conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments.

But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one.""",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_1dy6zi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1dy6zi/text_the_cab_ride_ill_never_forget/,

I've noticed a trend lately regarding the content posted here. At the time of me writing this there are 12 posts on the front page of /r/frisson tagged as [music], and 6 of those are reposts.

Now I'm not saying that music can't be frisson inducing, some of the purest frisson I've felt has been through music. But, as we all know, music taste varies enormously from person to person. The music that I find fit to belong in /r/frisson will most likely only appeal to a fraction of the subreddit readers.

Things like photographies, paintings, quotes and videos, however, are not as split into genres as music and thus appeal to a broader public.

A clear example of this can be seen by looking at /top/. If you look at the most upvoted posts there is not a single music post on the front page (excluding the dude singing in an oil chamber). This shows an obvious pattern of what most people find to belong on /r/frisson.

This is my favorite subreddit, and I don't want it to end up like the endless repost circlejerk that is /r/music.

&gt;When I was in 11th grade, my math teacher went off on a tangent about everything happening for a reason and why it is always important to be kind. At first I was only half listening, then things got interesting. When he was a senior in University he decided that in his last days he would go around to students sitting alone in the cafeteria and strike up a conversation. He approached a girl sitting alone and asked if he could have lunch with her. She seemed hesitant at first but then agreed. They struck up a conversation and ended up talking for a while. She eventually asked him, in a startled way, why he came and sat with her. He explained to her that it had become his goal to sit with people he didn't know. She told him that this wasn't the first time someone had randomly asked her to have lunch with them. Apparently when she was in high school she was very shy and unpopular and usually spent her lunch breaks in the library. Towards the end of the year a group of popular girls asked her to have lunch with them. She was shocked and and said no at first, they persisted and she eventually agreed. They got in one of the girls cars and drove off school property headed to a restaurant. As they were driving down the road dozens of cop cars whizzed past them.
She went to Columbine High School. It was April 20th/1999. She escaped being in the library, where the majority of the shootings took place, because a group of girls decided to reach out to her.",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_1i0jvd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1i0jvd/text_ustaybig_recounts_a_chilling_story_his_11th/,

after only working there three months i took a call from a trucker who had wrecked on the interstate and was flipped on his side. he was pinned by the steering colum and the lower part of his body was crushed (like mel gibsons wife in ""signs"".
usually when a wreck happens on the interstate we get bombarded with calls from everyone passing the vehicle. i happend to recieve that call from the man himself, he was awake and told me who he was, who he worked for, and that he must have dosed off for a second. he told me that he was pinned in and that the bottom part of his body was numb. he hold me where he was from and about his family (at this point i was making small talk to keep him calm) he started talking about god and asked me to pray with him, he lead the prayer, asking for help and for gods will to be done. i kept him on the line while responders traveled to the scene. as a little time went by, he started to slurr his speach and he wasnt comprehending my questions anymore, my guess is that he was slowly bleeding out and his level of conciousness was lowering. eventually he stopped answering my questions at all, he had passed out. very shortly after, responders arrived and extradited him out of the vehicle.. as soon as the pressure from the steering column was released he bled out. dying almost instantly. medics told me that if a team of the best doctors in the world were 20 ft away, they would not have been able to save him. i was pretty much the last person to talk to this man alive, and in my eyes i made friends with him.
being a dispatcher, you are the last person to talk to people all the time. but usually its a suicidal person, or an older person. not an innocent man trying to make a living for his family
that still sticks with me.. ive taken worse calls, heard some bad stuff.. but ive never felt a personal connection with any of them like i did with that truck driver.

It is alive as dreams are alive, more real than real ... for a moment at least ... that long magic moment before we wake.
Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli. Reality is plywood and plastic, done up in mud brown and olive drab. Fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. Reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end. Reality is the strip malls of Burbank, the smokestacks of Cleveland, a parking garage in Newark. Fantasy is the towers of Minas Tirith, the ancient stones of Gormenghast, the halls of Camelot. Fantasy flies on the wings of Icarus, reality on Southwest Airlines. Why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true?
We read fantasy to find the colors again, I think. To taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang. There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child who dreamt that one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever somewhere south of Oz and north of Shangri-La.

I remember, when 9/11 went down, my reaction was, ""Well, I've had it with humanity.""

But I was wrong. I don't know what's going to be revealed to be behind all of this mayhem. One human insect or a poisonous mass of broken sociopaths. 

But here's what I DO know. If it's one person or a HUNDRED people, that number is not even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the population on this planet. You watch the videos of the carnage and there are people running TOWARDS the destruction to help out. (Thanks FAKE Gallery founder and owner Paul Kozlowski for pointing this out to me). This is a giant planet and we're lucky to live on it but there are prices and penalties incurred for the daily miracle of existence. One of them is, every once in awhile, the wiring of a tiny sliver of the species gets snarled and they're pointed towards darkness. 

But the vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evil doers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak. This is beyond religion or creed or nation. We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil. We'd have eaten ourselves alive long ago. 

So when you spot violence, or bigotry, or intolerance or fear or just garden-variety misogyny, hatred or ignorance, just look it in the eye and think, ""The good outnumber you, and we always will.""

Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.

'You cannot pass,"" he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. 'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.'

The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.

From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.

Glamdring glittered white in answer.

There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.

'You cannot pass!' he said.

With a bound the Balrog leaped full onto the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.

'He cannot stand alone!' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. '*Elendil!*' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf!'

'Gondor!' cried Boromir and leaped after him.

At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.

With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss.

##Monday July 1, 21:40 UTC

One week ago I left Hong Kong after it became clear that my freedom and safety were under threat for revealing the truth. My continued liberty has been owed to the efforts of friends new and old, family, and others who I have never met and probably never will. I trusted them with my life and they returned that trust with a faith in me for which I will always be thankful.

On Thursday, President Obama declared before the world that he would not permit any diplomatic ""wheeling and dealing"" over my case. Yet now it is being reported that after promising not to do so, the President ordered his Vice President to pressure the leaders of nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions.

This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.

For decades the United States of America has been one of the strongest defenders of the human right to seek asylum. Sadly, this right, laid out and voted for by the U.S. in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is now being rejected by the current government of my country. The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon. Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.

In the end the Obama administration is not afraid of whistleblowers like me, Bradley Manning or Thomas Drake. We are stateless, imprisoned, or powerless. No, the Obama administration is afraid of you. It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised — and it should be.

I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many.

&gt;American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France a few German fighter plans flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation. 

&gt; The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody good as new. 

&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly so they would never hurt anybody ever again. 

&gt; The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed. That wasn't in the movie. Billy was extrapolating.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Last Question by Isaac Asimov — © 1956

The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:

Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking, flashing face — miles and miles of face — of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.

Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough — so Adell and Lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac’s.

For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth’s poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.

But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14, 2061, what had been theory, became fact.

The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.

Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.

They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle.

“It’s amazing when you think of it,” said Adell. His broad face had lines of weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. “All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.”

Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware. “Not forever,” he said.

“Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert.”

“That’s not forever.”

“All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Twenty billion, maybe. Are you satisfied?”

Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. “Twenty billion years isn’t forever.”

“Will, it will last our time, won’t it?”

“So would the coal and uranium.”

“All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel. You can’t do THAT on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac, if you don’t believe me.”

“I don’t have to ask Multivac. I know that.”

“Then stop running down what Multivac’s done for us,” said Adell, blazing up. “It did all right.”

“Who says it didn’t? What I say is that a sun won’t last forever. That’s all I’m saying. We’re safe for twenty billion years, but then what?” Lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. “And don’t say we’ll switch to another sun.”

There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally, and Lupov’s eyes slowly closed. They rested.

Then Lupov’s eyes snapped open. “You’re thinking we’ll switch to another sun when ours is done, aren’t you?”

“I’m not thinking.”

“Sure you are. You’re weak on logic, that’s the trouble with you. You’re like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn’t worried, you see, because he figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one.”

“I get it,” said Adell. “Don’t shout. When the sun is done, the other stars will be gone, too.”

“Darn right they will,” muttered Lupov. “It all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion, whatever that was, and it’ll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won’t last a hundred million years. The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that’s all.”

“I know all about entropy,” said Adell, standing on his dignity.

“The hell you do.”

“I know as much as you do.”

“Then you know everything’s got to run down someday.”

“All right. Who says they won’t?”

“You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever. You said ‘forever.’”

“It was Adell’s turn to be contrary. “Maybe we can build things up again someday,” he said.

“Never.”

“Why not? Someday.”

“Never.”

“Ask Multivac.”

“You ask Multivac. I dare you. Five dollars says it can’t be done.”

Adell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age?

Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?

Multivac fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the distant sounds of clicking relays ended.

Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

“No bet,” whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly.

By next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had forgotten about the incident.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non-time lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble-disk, centered.

“That’s X-23,” said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened.

The little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary sensation of inside-outness. They buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother, screaming, “We’ve reached X-23 — we’ve reached X-23 — we’ve —-”

“Quiet, children,” said Jerrodine sharply. “Are you sure, Jerrodd?”

“What is there to be but sure?” asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room, disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.

Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing the equations for the hyperspacial jumps.

Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship.

Someone had once told Jerrodd that the “ac” at the end of “Microvac” stood for “analog computer” in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.

Jerrodine’s eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. “I can’t help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth.”

“Why for Pete’s sake?” demanded Jerrodd. “We had nothing there. We’ll have everything on X-23. You won’t be alone. You won’t be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded.”

Then, after a reflective pause, “I tell you, it’s a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing.”

“I know, I know,” said Jerrodine miserably.

Jerrodette I said promptly, “Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world.”

“I think so, too,” said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.

It was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father’s youth, the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once, came refinement. In place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.

Jerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth’s Planetary AC (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible.

“So many stars, so many planets,” sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts. “I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now.”

“Not forever,” said Jerrodd, with a smile. “It will all stop someday, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase.”

“What’s entropy, daddy?” shrilled Jerrodette II.

“Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down of the universe. Everything runs down, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?”

“Can’t you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?”

The stars are the power-units, dear. Once they’re gone, there are no more power-units.”

Jerrodette I at once set up a howl. “Don’t let them, daddy. Don’t let the stars run down.”

“Now look what you’ve done,” whispered Jerrodine, exasperated.

“How was I to know it would frighten them?” Jerrodd whispered back.

“Ask the Microvac,” wailed Jerrodette I. “Ask him how to turn the stars on again.”

“Go ahead,” said Jerrodine. “It will quiet them down.” (Jerrodette II was beginning to cry, also.)

Jarrodd shrugged. “Now, now, honeys. I’ll ask Microvac. Don’t worry, he’ll tell us.”

He asked the Microvac, adding quickly, “Print the answer.”

Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, “See now, the Microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don’t worry.”

Jerrodine said, “and now children, it’s time for bed. We’ll be in our new home soon.”

Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.

VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, “Are we ridiculous, I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?”

MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. “I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion.”

Both seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed.

“Still,” said VJ-23X, “I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council.”

“I wouldn’t consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We’ve got to stir them up.”

VJ-23X sighed. “Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More.”

“A hundred billion is not infinite and it’s getting less infinite all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years –”

VJ-23X interrupted. “We can thank immortality for that.”

“Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us, but in solving the problems of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions.”

“Yet you wouldn’t want to abandon life, I suppose.”

“Not at all,” snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, “Not yet. I’m by no means old enough. How old are you?”

“Two hundred twenty-three. And you?”

“I’m still under two hundred. –But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we’ll have another filled in ten years. Another ten years and we’ll have filled two more. Another decade, four more. In a hundred years, we’ll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known Universe. Then what?”

VJ-23X said, “As a side issue, there’s a problem of transportation. I wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move Galaxies of individuals from one Galaxy to the next.”

“A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year.”

“Most of it’s wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those.”

“Granted, but even with a hundred per cent efficiency, we can only stave off the end. Our energy requirements are going up in geometric progression even faster than our population. We’ll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of Galaxies. A good point. A very good point.”

“We’ll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas.”

“Or out of dissipated heat?” asked MQ-17J, sarcastically.

“There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask the Galactic AC.”

VJ-23X was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his AC-contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him.

“I’ve half a mind to,” he said. “It’s something the human race will have to face someday.”

He stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself, but it was connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic AC that served all mankind. Hyperspace considered, it was an integral part of the Galactic AC.

MQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic AC. It was on a little world of its own, a spider webbing of force-beams holding the matter within which surges of sub-mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves. Yet despite it’s sub-etheric workings, the Galactic AC was known to be a full thousand feet across.

MQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact, “Can entropy ever be reversed?”

VJ-23X looked startled and said at once, “Oh, say, I didn’t really mean to have you ask that.”

“Why not?”

“We both know entropy can’t be reversed. You can’t turn smoke and ash back into a tree.”

“Do you have trees on your world?” asked MQ-17J.

The sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said: THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

VJ-23X said, “See!”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council.
Zee Prime’s mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, each with its load of humanity – but a load that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to be found out here, in space.

Minds, not bodies! The immortal bodies remained back on the planets, in suspension over the eons. Sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer. Few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng, but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals.

Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.

“I am Zee Prime,” said Zee Prime. “And you?”

“I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?”

“We call it only the Galaxy. And you?”

“We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?”

“True. Since all Galaxies are the same.”

“Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different.”

Zee Prime said, “On which one?”

“I cannot say. The Universal AC would know.”

“Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious.”

Zee Prime’s perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrunk and became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the originals Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.

Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and called, out: “Universal AC! On which Galaxy did mankind originate?”

The Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its receptors ready, and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal AC kept itself aloof.

Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal AC, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across, difficult to see.

“But how can that be all of Universal AC?” Zee Prime had asked.

“Most of it, ” had been the answer, “is in hyperspace. In what form it is there I cannot imagine.”

Nor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any man had any part of the making of a universal AC. Each Universal AC designed and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.

The Universal AC interrupted Zee Prime’s wandering thoughts, not with words, but with guidance. Zee Prime’s mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars.

A thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. “THIS IS THE ORIGINAL GALAXY OF MAN.”

But it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Zee Prime stifled his disappointment.

Dee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied the other, said suddenly, “And is one of these stars the original star of Man?”

The Universal AC said, “MAN’S ORIGINAL STAR HAS GONE NOVA. IT IS NOW A WHITE DWARF.”

“Did the men upon it die?” asked Zee Prime, startled and without thinking.

The Universal AC said, “A NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES, WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TIME.”

“Yes, of course,” said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.

Dee Sub Wun said, “What is wrong?”

“The stars are dying. The original star is dead.”

“They must all die. Why not?”

“But when all energy is gone, our bodies will finally die, and you and I with them.”

“It will take billions of years.”

“I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years. Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?”

Dee sub Wun said in amusement, “You’re asking how entropy might be reversed in direction.”

And the Universal AC answered. “THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”

Zee Prime’s thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light-years away, or on the star next to Zee Prime’s own. It didn’t matter.

Unhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own. If the stars must someday die, at least some could yet be built.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Man considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other, indistinguishable.

Man said, “The Universe is dying.”

Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts, were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.

New stars had been built of the dust between the stars, some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too.

Man said, “Carefully husbanded, as directed by the Cosmic AC, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.”

“But even so,” said Man, “eventually it will all come to an end. However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum.”

Man said, “Can entropy not be reversed? Let us ask the Cosmic AC.”

The Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and Nature no longer had meaning to any terms that Man could comprehend.

“Cosmic AC,” said Man, “How may entropy be reversed?”

The Cosmic AC said, “THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”

Man said, “Collect additional data.”

The Cosmic AC said, “I WILL DO SO. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A HUNDRED BILLION YEARS. MY PREDECESSORS AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES. ALL THE DATA I HAVE REMAINS INSUFFICIENT.”

“Will there come a time,” said Man, “when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances?”

The Cosmic AC said, “NO PROBLEM IS INSOLUBLE IN ALL CONCEIVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.”

Man said, “When will you have enough data to answer the question?”

“THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”

“Will you keep working on it?” asked Man.

The Cosmic AC said, “I WILL.”

Man said, “We shall wait.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down.

One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.

Man’s last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.

Man said, “AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?”

AC said, “THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”

Man’s last mind fused and only AC existed — and that in hyperspace.
Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man.

All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness.

All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.

But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.

A timeless interval was spent in doing that.

And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.

But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer — by demonstration — would take care of that, too.

For another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program.

The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.

And AC said, “LET THERE BE LIGHT!”

And there was light –

Missed Connection - m4w


I saw you on the Manhattan-bound Brooklyn Q train. 


I was wearing a blue-striped t-shirt and a pair of maroon pants. You were wearing a vintage red skirt and a smart white blouse. We both wore glasses. I guess we still do.


You got on at DeKalb and sat across from me and we made eye contact, briefly. I fell in love with you a little bit, in that stupid way where you completely make up a fictional version of the person you're looking at and fall in love with that person. But still I think there was something there.


Several times we looked at each other and then looked away. I tried to think of something to say to you -- maybe pretend I didn't know where I was going and ask you for directions or say something nice about your boot-shaped earrings, or just say, ""Hot day."" It all seemed so stupid.


At one point, I caught you staring at me and you immediately averted your eyes. You pulled a book out of your bag and started reading it -- a biography of Lyndon Johnson -- but I noticed you never once turned a page.


My stop was Union Square, but at Union Square I decided to stay on, rationalizing that I could just as easily transfer to the 7 at 42nd Street, but then I didn't get off at 42nd Street either. You must have missed your stop as well, because when we got all the way to the end of the line at Ditmars, we both just sat there in the car, waiting.


I cocked my head at you inquisitively. You shrugged and held up your book as if that was the reason.


Still I said nothing.


We took the train all the way back down -- down through Astoria, across the East River, weaving through midtown, from Times Square to Herald Square to Union Square, under SoHo and Chinatown, up across the bridge back into Brooklyn, past Barclays and Prospect Park, past Flatbush and Midwood and Sheepshead Bay, all the way to Coney Island. And when we got to Coney Island, I knew I had to say something.


Still I said nothing.


And so we went back up.


Up and down the Q line, over and over. We caught the rush hour crowds and then saw them thin out again. We watched the sun set over Manhattan as we crossed the East River. I gave myself deadlines: I'll talk to her before Newkirk; I'll talk to her before Canal. Still I remained silent.


For months we sat on the train saying nothing to each other. We survived on bags of skittles sold to us by kids raising money for their basketball teams. We must have heard a million mariachi bands, had our faces nearly kicked in by a hundred thousand break dancers. I gave money to the beggars until I ran out of singles. When the train went above ground I'd get text messages and voicemails (""Where are you? What happened? Are you okay?"") until my phone ran out of battery.


I'll talk to her before daybreak; I'll talk to her before Tuesday. The longer I waited, the harder it got. What could I possibly say to you now, now that we've passed this same station for the hundredth time? Maybe if I could go back to the first time the Q switched over to the local R line for the weekend, I could have said, ""Well, this is inconvenient,"" but I couldn't very well say it now, could I? I would kick myself for days after every time you sneezed -- why hadn't I said ""Bless You""? That tiny gesture could have been enough to pivot us into a conversation, but here in stupid silence still we sat.


There were nights when we were the only two souls in the car, perhaps even on the whole train, and even then I felt self-conscious about bothering you. She's reading her book, I thought, she doesn't want to talk to me. Still, there were moments when I felt a connection. Someone would shout something crazy about Jesus and we'd immediately look at each other to register our reactions. A couple of teenagers would exit, holding hands, and we'd both think: Young Love.


For sixty years, we sat in that car, just barely pretending not to notice each other. I got to know you so well, if only peripherally. I memorized the folds of your body, the contours of your face, the patterns of your breath. I saw you cry once after you'd glanced at a neighbor's newspaper. I wondered if you were crying about something specific, or just the general passage of time, so unnoticeable until suddenly noticeable. I wanted to comfort you, wrap my arms around you, assure you I knew everything would be fine, but it felt too familiar; I stayed glued to my seat.


One day, in the middle of the afternoon, you stood up as the train pulled into Queensboro Plaza. It was difficult for you, this simple task of standing up, you hadn't done it in sixty years. Holding onto the rails, you managed to get yourself to the door. You hesitated briefly there, perhaps waiting for me to say something, giving me one last chance to stop you, but rather than spit out a lifetime of suppressed almost-conversations I said nothing, and I watched you slip out between the closing sliding doors.


It took me a few more stops before I realized you were really gone. I kept waiting for you to reenter the subway car, sit down next to me, rest your head on my shoulder. Nothing would be said. Nothing would need to be said.


When the train returned to Queensboro Plaza, I craned my neck as we entered the station. Perhaps you were there, on the platform, still waiting. Perhaps I would see you, smiling and bright, your long gray hair waving in the wind from the oncoming train.


But no, you were gone. And I realized most likely I would never see you again. And I thought about how amazing it is that you can know somebody for sixty years and yet still not really know that person at all.


I stayed on the train until it got to Union Square, at which point I got off and transferred to the L.",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_1jx8ew,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1jx8ew/text_missed_connection_from_craigslist/,

1374859085.0,226,self.Frisson,1j3w7s,[Text] You should date an illiterate girl,GridGazelle,507,281,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1j3w7s/text_you_should_date_an_illiterate_girl/,"You should date an illiterate girl.

Date a girl who doesn't read. Find her in the weary squalor of a Midwestern bar. Find her in the smoke, drunken sweat, and varicolored light of an upscale nightclub. Wherever you find her, find her smiling. Make sure that it lingers when the people that are talking to her look away. Engage her with unsentimental trivialities. Use pick-up lines and laugh inwardly. Take her outside when the night overstays its welcome. Ignore the palpable weight of fatigue. Kiss her in the rain under the weak glow of a streetlamp because you’ve seen it in a film. Remark at its lack of significance. Take her to your apartment. Dispatch with making love. Fuck her.

Let the anxious contract you've unwittingly written evolve slowly and uncomfortably into a relationship. Find shared interests and common ground like sushi and folk music. Build an impenetrable bastion upon that ground. Make it sacred. Retreat into it every time the air gets stale or the evenings too long. Talk about nothing of significance. Do little thinking. Let the months pass unnoticed. Ask her to move in. Let her decorate. Get into fights about inconsequential things like how the fucking shower curtain needs to be closed so that it doesn't fucking collect mold. Let a year pass unnoticed. Begin to notice.

Figure that you should probably get married because you will have wasted a lot of time otherwise. Take her to dinner on the forty-fifth floor at a restaurant far beyond your means. Make sure there is a beautiful view of the city. Sheepishly ask a waiter to bring her a glass of champagne with a modest ring in it. When she notices, propose to her with all of the enthusiasm and sincerity you can muster. Do not be overly concerned if you feel your heart leap through a pane of sheet glass. For that matter, do not be overly concerned if you cannot feel it at all. If there is applause, let it stagnate. If she cries, smile as if you’ve never been happier. If she doesn't, smile all the same.

Let the years pass unnoticed. Get a career, not a job. Buy a house. Have two striking children. Try to raise them well. Fail frequently. Lapse into a bored indifference. Lapse into an indifferent sadness. Have a mid-life crisis. Grow old. Wonder at your lack of achievement. Feel sometimes contented, but mostly vacant and ethereal. Feel, during walks, as if you might never return or as if you might blow away on the wind. Contract a terminal illness. Die, but only after you observe that the girl who didn't read never made your heart oscillate with any significant passion, that no one will write the story of your lives, and that she will die, too, with only a mild and tempered regret that nothing ever came of her capacity to love.

Do those things, god damnit, because nothing sucks worse than a girl who reads. Do it, I say, because a life in purgatory is better than a life in hell. Do it, because a girl who reads possesses a vocabulary that can describe that amorphous discontent of a life unfulfilled—a vocabulary that parses the innate beauty of the world and makes it an accessible necessity instead of an alien wonder. A girl who reads lays claim to a vocabulary that distinguishes between the specious and soulless rhetoric of someone who cannot love her, and the inarticulate desperation of someone who loves her too much. A vocabulary, goddamnit, that makes my vacuous sophistry a cheap trick.

Do it, because a girl who reads understands syntax. Literature has taught her that moments of tenderness come in sporadic but knowable intervals. A girl who reads knows that life is not planar; she knows, and rightly demands, that the ebb comes along with the flow of disappointment. A girl who has read up on her syntax senses the irregular pauses—the hesitation of breath—endemic to a lie. A girl who reads perceives the difference between a parenthetical moment of anger and the entrenched habits of someone whose bitter cynicism will run on, run on well past any point of reason, or purpose, run on far after she has packed a suitcase and said a reluctant goodbye and she has decided that I am an ellipsis and not a period and run on and run on. Syntax that knows the rhythm and cadence of a life well lived.

Date a girl who doesn't read because the girl who reads knows the importance of plot. She can trace out the demarcations of a prologue and the sharp ridges of a climax. She feels them in her skin. The girl who reads will be patient with an intermission and expedite a denouement. But of all things, the girl who reads knows most the ineluctable significance of an end. She is comfortable with them. She has bid farewell to a thousand heroes with only a twinge of sadness.

Don’t date a girl who reads because girls who read are storytellers. You with the Joyce, you with the Nabokov, you with the Woolf. You there in the library, on the platform of the metro, you in the corner of the café, you in the window of your room. You, who make my life so goddamned difficult. The girl who reads has spun out the account of her life and it is bursting with meaning. She insists that her narratives are rich, her supporting cast colorful, and her typeface bold. You, the girl who reads, make me want to be everything that I am not. But I am weak and I will fail you, because you have dreamed, properly, of someone who is better than I am. You will not accept the life of which I spoke at the beginning of this piece. You will accept nothing less than passion, and perfection, and a life worthy of being told. So out with you, girl who reads. Take the next southbound train and take your Hemingway with you. Or, perhaps, stay and save my life.

story text copied from http://downlode.org/Etext/nine_billion_names_of_god.html

 “This is a slightly unusual request,” said Dr. Wagner, with what he hoped was commendable restraint. “As far as I know, it’s the first time anyone’s been asked to supply a Tibetan monastery with an Automatic Sequence Computer. I don’t wish to be inquisitive, but I should hardly have thought that your — ah — establishment had much use for such a machine. Could you explain just what you intend to do with it?”

“Gladly,” replied the lama, readjusting his silk robes and carefully putting away the slide rule he had been using for currency conversions. “Your Mark V Computer can carry out any routine mathematical operation involving up to ten digits. However, for our work we are interested in letters, not numbers. As we wish you to modify the output circuits, the machine will be printing words, not columns of figures.”

“I don’t quite understand....”

“This is a project on which we have been working for the last three centuries — since the lamasery was founded, in fact. It is somewhat alien to your way of thought, so I hope you will listen with an open mind while I explain it.”

“Naturally.”

“It is really quite simple. We have been compiling a list which shall contain all the possible names of God.”

“I beg your pardon?”

“We have reason to believe,” continued the lama imperturbably, “that all such names can be written with not more than nine letters in an alphabet we have devised.”

“And you have been doing this for three centuries?”

“Yes: we expected it would take us about fifteen thousand years to complete the task.”

“Oh,” Dr. Wagner looked a little dazed. “Now I see why you wanted to hire one of our machines. But exactly what is the purpose of this project?”

The lama hesitated for a fraction of a second, and Wagner wondered if he had offended him. If so, there was no trace of annoyance in the reply.

“Call it ritual, if you like, but it’s a fundamental part of our belief. All the many names of the Supreme Being — God, Jehovah, Allah, and so on — they are only man-made labels. There is a philosophical problem of some difficulty here, which I do not propose to discuss, but somewhere among all the possible combinations of letters that can occur are what one may call the real names of God. By systematic permutation of letters, we have been trying to list them all.”

“I see. You’ve been starting at AAAAAAA... and working up to ZZZZZZZZ....”

“Exactly — though we use a special alphabet of our own. Modifying the electromatic typewriters to deal with this is, of course, trivial. A rather more interesting problem is that of devising suitable circuits to eliminate ridiculous combinations. For example, no letter must occur more than three times in succession.”

“Three? Surely you mean two.”

“Three is correct: I am afraid it would take too long to explain why, even if you understood our language.”

“I’m sure it would,” said Wagner hastily. “Go on.”

“Luckily, it will be a simple matter to adapt your Automatic Sequence Computer for this work, since once it has been programmed properly it will permute each letter in turn and print the result. What would have taken us fifteen thousand years it will be able to do in a hundred days.”

Dr. Wagner was scarcely conscious of the faint sounds from the Manhattan streets far below. He was in a different world, a world of natural, not man-made, mountains. High up in their remote aeries these monks had been patiently at work, generation after generation, compiling their lists of meaningless words. Was there any limit to the follies of mankind? Still, he must give no hint of his inner thoughts. The customer was always right....

“There’s no doubt,” replied the doctor, “that we can modify the Mark V to print lists of this nature. I’m much more worried about the problem of installation and maintenance. Getting out to Tibet, in these days, is not going to be easy.”

“We can arrange that. The components are small enough to travel by air — that is one reason why we chose your machine. If you can get them to India, we will provide transport from there.”

“And you want to hire two of our engineers?”

“Yes, for the three months that the project should occupy.”

“I’ve no doubt that Personnel can manage that.” Dr. Wagner scribbled a note on his desk pad. “There are just two other points —”

Before he could finish the sentence the lama had produced a small slip of paper.

“This is my certified credit balance at the Asiatic Bank.”

“Thank you. It appears to be — ah — adequate. The second matter is so trivial that I hesitate to mention it — but it’s surprising how often the obvious gets overlooked. What source of electrical energy have you?”

“A diesel generator providing fifty kilowatts at a hundred and ten volts. It was installed about five years ago and is quite reliable. It’s made life at the lamasery much more comfortable, but of course it was really installed to provide power for the motors driving the prayer wheels.”

“Of course,” echoed Dr. Wagner. “I should have thought of that.”

The view from the parapet was vertiginous, but in time one gets used to anything. After three months, George Hanley was not impressed by the two-thousand-foot swoop into the abyss or the remote checkerboard of fields in the valley below. He was leaning against the wind-smoothed stones and staring morosely at the distant mountains whose names he had never bothered to discover.

This, thought George, was the craziest thing that had ever happened to him. “Project Shangri-La,” some wit back at the labs had christened it. For weeks now the Mark V had been churning out acres of sheets covered with gibberish. Patiently, inexorably, the computer had been rearranging letters in all their possible combinations, exhausting each class before going on to the next. As the sheets had emerged from the electromatic typewriters, the monks had carefully cut them up and pasted them into enormous books.

In another week, heaven be praised, they would have finished. Just what obscure calculations had convinced the monks that they needn’t bother to go on to words of ten, twenty, or a hundred letters, George didn’t know. One of his recurring nightmares was that there would be some change of plan, and that the high lama (whom they’d naturally called Sam Jaffe, though he didn’t look a bit like him) would suddenly announce that the project would be extended to approximately A.D. 2060. They were quite capable of it.

George heard the heavy wooden door slam in the wind as Chuck came out onto the parapet beside him. As usual, Chuck was smoking one of the cigars that made him so popular with the monks — who, it seemed, were quite willing to embrace all the minor and most of the major pleasures of life. That was one thing in their favor: they might be crazy, but they weren’t bluenoses. Those frequent trips they took down to the village, for instance...

“Listen, George,” said Chuck urgently. “I’ve learned something that means trouble.”

“What’s wrong? Isn’t the machine behaving?” That was the worst contingency George could imagine. It might delay his return, and nothing could be more horrible. The way he felt now, even the sight of a TV commercial would seem like manna from heaven. At least it would be some link with home.

“No — it’s nothing like that.” Chuck settled himself on the parapet, which was unusual because normally he was scared of the drop. “I’ve just found what all this is about.”

What d’ya mean? I thought we knew.”

“Sure — we know what the monks are trying to do. But we didn’t know why. It’s the craziest thing—”

“Tell me something new,” growled George.

“— but old Sam’s just come clean with me. You know the way he drops in every afternoon to watch the sheets roll out. Well, this time he seemed rather excited, or at least as near as he’ll ever get to it. When I told him that we were on the last cycle he asked me, in that cute English accent of his, if I’d ever wondered what they were trying to do. I said, ‘Sure’ — and he told me.”

“Go on: I’ll buy it.”

“Well, they believe that when they have listed all His names — and they reckon that there are about nine billion of them — God’s purpose will be achieved. The human race will have finished what it was created to do, and there won’t be any point in carrying on. Indeed, the very idea is something like blasphemy.”

“Then what do they expect us to do? Commit suicide?”

“There’s no need for that. When the list’s completed, God steps in and simply winds things up... bingo!”

“Oh, I get it. When we finish our job, it will be the end of the world.”

Chuck gave a nervous little laugh.

“That’s just what I said to Sam. And do you know what happened? He looked at me in a very queer way, like I’d been stupid in class, and said, ’It’s nothing as trivial as that.’ ”

George thought this over a moment.

“That’s what I call taking the Wide View,” he said presently. “But what d’you suppose we should do about it? I don’t see that it makes the slightest difference to us. After all, we already knew that they were crazy.”

“Yes — but don’t you see what may happen? When the list’s complete and the Last Trump doesn’t blow — or whatever it is they expect — we may get the blame. It’s our machine they’ve been using. I don’t like the situation one little bit.”

“I see,” said George slowly. “You’ve got a point there. But this sort of thing’s happened before, you know. When I was a kid down in Louisiana we had a crackpot preacher who once said the world was going to end next Sunday. Hundreds of people believed him — even sold their homes. Yet when nothing happened, they didn’t turn nasty, as you’d expect. They just decided that he’d made a mistake in his calculations and went right on believing. I guess some of them still do.”

“Well, this isn’t Louisiana, in case you hadn’t noticed. There are just two of us and hundreds of these monks. I like them, and I’ll be sorry for old Sam when his lifework backfires on him. But all the same, I wish I was somewhere else.”

“I’ve been wishing that for weeks. But there’s nothing we can do until the contract’s finished and the transport arrives to fly us out.

“Of course,” said Chuck thoughtfully, “we could always try a bit of sabotage.”

“Like hell we could! That would make things worse.”

“Not the way I meant. Look at it like this. The machine will finish its run four days from now, on the present twenty-hours-a-day basis. The transport calls in a week. O.K. — then all we need to do is to find something that needs replacing during one of the overhaul periods — something that will hold up the works for a couple of days. We’ll fix it, of course, but not too quickly. If we time matters properly, we can be down at the airfield when the last name pops out of the register. They won’t be able to catch us then.”

“I don’t like it,” said George. “It will be the first time I ever walked out on a job. Besides, it ’would make them suspicious. No, I’ll sit tight and take what comes.”

""I still don’t like it,” he said, seven days later, as the tough little mountain ponies carried them down the winding road. “And don’t you think I’m running away because I’m afraid. I’m just sorry for those poor old guys up there, and I don’t want to be around when they find what suckers they’ve been. Wonder how Sam will take it?” “It’s funny,” replied Chuck, “but when I said good-by I got the idea he knew we were walking out on him — and that he didn’t care because he knew the machine was running smoothly and that the job would soon be finished. After that — well, of course, for him there just isn’t any After That....”

George turned in his saddle and stared back up the mountain road. This was the last place from which one could get a clear view of the lamasery. The squat, angular buildings were silhouetted against the afterglow of the sunset: here and there, lights gleamed like portholes in the side of an ocean liner. Electric lights, of course, sharing the same circuit as the Mark V. How much longer would they share it? wondered George. Would the monks smash up the computer in their rage and disappointment? Or would they just sit down quietly and begin their calculations all over again?”

He knew exactly what was happening up on the mountain at this very moment. The high lama and his assistants would be sitting in their silk robes, inspecting the sheets as the junior monks carried them away from the typewriters and pasted them into the great volumes. No one would be saying anything. The only sound would be the incessant patter, the never-ending rainstorm of the keys hitting the paper, for the Mark V itself was utterly silent as it flashed through its thousands of calculations a second. Three months of this, thought George, was enough to start anyone climbing up the wall.

“There she is!” called Chuck, pointing down into the valley. “Ain’t she beautiful!”

She certainly was, thought George. The battered old DC3 lay at the end of the runway like a tiny silver cross. In two hours she would be bearing them away to freedom and sanity. It was a thought worth savoring like a fine liqueur. George let it roll round his mind as the pony trudged patiently down the slope.

The swift night of the high Himalayas was now almost upon them. Fortunately, the road was very good, as roads went in that region, and they were both carrying torches. There was not the slightest danger, only a certain discomfort from the bitter cold. The sky overhead was perfectly clear, and ablaze with the familiar, friendly stars. At least there would be no risk, thought George, of the pilot being unable to take off because of weather conditions. That had been his only remaining worry.

He began to sing, but gave it up after a while. This vast arena of mountains, gleaming like whitely hooded ghosts on every side, did not encourage such ebullience. Presently George glanced at his watch.

“Should be there in an hour,” he called back over his shoulder to Chuck. Then he added, in an afterthought: “Wonder if the computer’s finished its run. It was due about now.”

Chuck didn’t reply, so George swung round in his saddle. He could just see Chuck’s face, a white oval turned toward the sky.

“Look,” whispered Chuck, and George lifted his eyes to heaven. (There is always a last time for everything.)

My optimism and general outlook had begun to gradually decline. I just started to ""feel"" less and less. Things that should have made me happy or sad didn't. I'm not quite sure when it exactly started or why, but after breaking up with my long term girlfriend I hit some pretty rough times. I didn't see any point to getting out of bed, and even forcing myself to eat once a day was difficult. 

I think what eventually got me out of the slums was to start listening to my feelings. Music helped a lot. I started to notice that I would experience frisson when I heard something really meaningful in a lyric. I can't tell you all how good it felt to actually feel something again. I started to practice ""feeling"" again. I could tell I was improving when more songs started to give me frisson.

I'm in a much better place now. I have a new understanding of myself, and I'm extremely grateful for it. I'm at the point where if I listen to a song that I can empathize with, I'm able to experience frisson for nearly the entirety of the song. I can feel the needles reverberate throughout most of my body too; when I first started feeling frisson it was much more localized.

I just wanted to share that, and let you know that frisson is more than just feeling good.

**My Darling Wife**

This note is to warn you of a diabolical plot entered into by some of our so called friends — (ha!) calendar makers and even our own children. These and others would have you believe we've been married 20 years.

20 minutes maybe — but never 20 years. In the first place it is a known fact that a human cannot sustain the high level of happiness I feel for more than a few minutes — and my happiness keeps increasing. 

I will confess to one puzzlement but I'm sure it is just some trick perpetrated by our friends — (Ha again!) I can't remember ever being without you and I know I was born more than 20 mins ago.

Oh well — that isn't important. The important thing is I don't want to be without you for the next 20 years, or 40, or however many there are. I've gotten very used to being happy and I love you very much indeed.

I wasn't emotionally charged by the whole event until today, when i went for my usual run. As i was running to the song, bleed out by blue october, i began to think of how her loved ones must feel and i tried to feel that same anger, pain, and sadness. I began to become caught up in the music and the emotions, so much so, that i ran my 5k 3 minutes faster than my personal record. I ran with tears on my face, i ran harder and harder every time i realized that girl will never get to run again, smile again, graduate from college. I realized how stupid i have been to let myself develop a diagnosed eating disorder, all because i cared about what people would think of me i didn't have a six-pack. I realized that the mind and body are two separate things. The mind will often hold us back from that which challenges us, but it was when we find what can push us beyond our expectations, just as i was able to ignite my soul for the first time. That fire is still burning, and i don't plan on it ever going out. For all you who can't seem to push beyond your limits, find a way to ignite your soul, and blaze yourself a fricken trail of glory and passion for life. You never know when your life will end quicker than the flame from a candle in the wind.

* Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but, when we look back everything is different 

* When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.

* All mortals tend to turn into the thing they are pretending to be. 

* It is the magician's bargain: give up our soul, get power in return. But once our souls, that is, ourselves, have been given up, the power thus conferred will not belong to us. We shall in fact be the slaves and puppets of that to which we have given our souls.

* [Mortals] say of some temporal suffering, ""No future bliss can make up for it,"" not knowing Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even that agony into a glory. And of some sinful pleasure they say ""Let me have but this and I'll take the consequences"": little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back into their past and contaminate the pleasure of the sin. Both processes begin even before death.

* There have been men before … who got so interested in proving the existence of God that they came to care nothing for God himself… as if the good Lord had nothing to do but to exist. There have been some who were so preoccupied with spreading Christianity that they never gave a thought to Christ.

* To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket — safe, dark, motionless, airless — it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. [Bonus Comic](http://zenpencils.com/comic/103-c-s-lewis-to-love-at-all/)

* Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create). It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.

* It's so much easier to pray for a bore than to go and see one.

* Her (his recently deceased wife) absence is no more emphatic in those places than anywhere else. It's not local at all. I suppose if one were forbidden all salt one wouldn't notice it much more in any one food more than another. Eating in general would be different, every day, at every meal. It is like that. The act of living is different all through. Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.

* I want to have her back as an ingredient in the restoration of my past. Could I have wished her anything worse? Having got once through death, to come back and then, at some later date, have all her dying to do all over again? They call Stephen the first martyr. Hadn't Lazarus the rawer deal?

* (on Lord of the Rings) 'But why,' (some ask), 'why, if you have a serious comment to make on the real life of men, must you do it by talking about a phantasmagoric never-never land of your own?' Because, I take it, one of the main things the author wants to say is that the real life of men is of that mythical and heroic quality. One can see the principle at work in his characterization. Much that in a realistic work would be done by 'character delineation' is here done simply by making the character an elf, a dwarf, or a hobbit. The imagined beings have their insides on the outside; they are visible souls. And man as a whole, Man pitted against the universe, have we seen him at all till we see that he is like a hero in a fairy tale?

1322695579.0,191,self.Frisson,mvcsv,Im tired of this sub-reddit becoming all music posts... Here are my absolute favorite scenes of pure frisson from some of my favorite films.,JackHorner_Filmmaker,208,17,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/mvcsv/im_tired_of_this_subreddit_becoming_all_music/,"**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THESE SCENES ARE SPOILERS
**

Here are just a few of my favorites.  Feel free to add your own favorites and lets start making this sub-reddit more diverse!!!

**Jurassic Park** (1993): Speilberg reinvented the summer movie with this one.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJlmYh27MHg) scene changed my life and singlehandedly made me want to be a filmmaker.Sadly what we didnt know was it would be the last of the actually intellectually fascinating blockbusters until...

**The Lord of the Rings** (2001-2003):  Really, pretty much every scene in these films could be posted here.  As Ive already seen the ""For Frodo"" scene posted here, Ill skip that one but its easy to find.  If you dont get frisson from [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL9vUjm2mIE) scenes though I dont have anything to say but... how? 

**Pleasantville** (1998):  Another movie that induces frisson throughout.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrCH-W8_fA8) scene though is the standout.  A film about the death of innocence, but the beauty of change.  Keep in mind that up until this point, the character in this scene has never seen color paintings.

**Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind** (2004):  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/user/movieclips#p/search/0/Sy7YnrVXudg) is the emotional climax of the memory section of the film.  If you haven't seen the film this scene wont make any sense but sufice it to say the film might be the greatest film of the past decade so go see it.  

**The Truman Show** (1998): The whole [END SCENE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1LM7Q3Hqi4) of the film is breathtaking.  A film that challenges viewers to break out of their sheltered lives and see the world for what it truly is.  Serious Jim Carrey is the best kind of Jim Carrey.

**2001: A Space Odyssey** (1968): What can I say except, fuckin Stanley Kubrick.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUwCkKIYY80) docking scene is absolutely magical.

**Almost Famous** (1999): Possibly the defining scene of 1990's cinema.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHH3FoJUEbg) scene illustrates the power of music to bring people together, and heal all hurts, no matter how deep.

**Jerry Maguire** (1995): Cameron Crowe is a master of Frisson.  Everyone knows about the ""You complete me"" scene but [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQeMyr9jnQ0&amp;feature=related) is the true frisson filled scene for me.  It really kicks into gear around 2:30.

**Cool Runnings** (1993):  Its cheesy as all hell but if [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31M_MdSVxV8)  doesn't raise the hairs on the back of your neck and make you shed a tear, I dont know what will.  The greatest slow clap in the history of film in my opinion.


*EDIT*:  I had planned on making this a lot longer before so now that I have a bit more free time this morning Im adding some more favorites.  

**Road to Perdition** (2002):  One of the most beautiful shootouts put to film in my opinion.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZphC0_XpDp4) is why Im excited that Sam Mendes is directing the new 007 film.

**Moon** (2009):  Sam Rockwell coping with the fact that he is a clone is some of the best acting in the last few years.  Do yourself a favor and see this flick.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C_VGqSaBgM) is my favorite scene.

**(500) Days of Summer** (2009): Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a clip of the full scene but [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-xJ15AN9ts) gives you an idea of what Im getting at.  The trully frisson filled moments are after this video ends sadly.  Go check out this movie if you haven't already.

**Oceans 11** (2001):  Its almost cheating to use Claire de Lune to induce frisson but regardless, [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLDFOzB2iHc) scene of pure joy is hard to ignore.

**There Will Be Blood** (2007): Daniel Day Lewis doesnt even need music to help induce frisson.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEeA7BdjteM) is one of the greatest performances of all time and one of the best acted scenes of all time.

**Ratatouille** (2007): [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IvnptQJ__U) beautifully delivered speech really does it for me.  Although I question Brad Bird's almost Ayn Rand like messages, Im able to ignore them when they are displayed this well.

**How to Train Your Dragon** (2010):  If you didnt see [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbZtfznQb-Y) in 3D you really missed out.  Ive never seen a film capture the feeling of flying quite like this.  John Powell's score makes me all tingly inside even without the visuals but with them... holy titballs.

**Once** (2007):  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_rkeqWdoog) is the song that opens up the film and when he gets to the climax of the song its breathtaking.  Glen Hansard is a god.  There are multiple examples of music in this film inducing frisson but I dont want to spoil the best ones for those who havent seen it :).",,False,,t5_2smzw,True,,,True,t3_mvcsv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/mvcsv/im_tired_of_this_subreddit_becoming_all_music/,

You came home from school

on a special bus

full of people

who look like you

and love like you

and you met me

for the first time

and you loved me.

You love everybody

so much that it's not safe

to let you out alone.

Eleven years of love

and trust and time for you to learn

that you can't go on loving like this.

Unless you are stopped

you will embrace every person you see.

Normal people don't do that.

Some Normal people will hurt you

very badly because you do.

Cripples don't look nice

but you embrace them.

You kissed a wino on the bus

and he broke down and cried

and he said 'Nobody has kissed me

for the last 30 years.

But you did.

You touched my face

with your fingers and said

'I like you.'

The world will never

be ready for you.

Your way is right

and the world will never be ready. 

We could learn everything

that we need to know

by watching you

going to your special school

in your special bus

full of people

who look like you

and love like you

and it's not safe

to let you out alone.

If you're not normal

there is very little hope

for the rest of us.

Let's clear up some misconceptions!,Koudvorst,204,27,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/14rskg/psa_just_what_is_frisson_lets_clear_up_some/,"It has been noted by a few people around this subreddit recently that many top rated posts seem to be missing the ‘point’ of frisson. I would tend to agree, and it has driven me to create this PSA informative post: Just what exactly **is** Frisson, and how do you know when you experience it?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A quick Google of the definition mentions that Frisson is ‘A sudden, passing sensation of excitement; a shudder of emotion; thrill.’^[1](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Frisson?s=t) Frisson is that feeling most people get when listening to a particular piece of music, or watching a very emotionally intense scene in a movie or video. Mind you, it can also happen when looking at a photograph or having a sudden, deeply intense realization (although those are much rarer). 


Frisson begins to make a bit more sense if you look at the Wikipedia stub for it where it’s mentioned as: “A cold chill ... a **pleasant tingling feeling**, associated with the flexing of hair follicles **resulting in goose bumps**, accompanied by a **cold sensation**, and sometimes producing a **shudder or shiver**.""^[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson)

I bolded a few of the important defining physical characteristics of Frisson because in essence, it is a physical reaction to outside stimuli.



Musicologist David Huron was recently studying music-related Frisson and found that Opera was a good candidate to evoke Frisson because: “Opera singers produce the bulk of their sound energy in the 3-to4-kilohertz range. Humans are quite sensitive to this range, probably because it is also the range of a human scream”^[3](http://www.mindupdate.com/2011/10/the-science-behind-getting-chills-from-music/) 


‘Ok sure’ you say, ‘I don’t really listen to opera or screaming humans, so how is any of this relevant?’ Good point!


Huron goes on to explain why we seek out the feeling of Frisson if it’s linked to such a fearful and mentally jarring sound: 


    The brain, Huron said, has two competing goals. One, the unconscious “fast path,” 
    is to “react as fast as possible, especially to danger.” The other, the “slow, conscious 
    path,” is to “react as accurately as possible.” When a listener experience (a) frisson, 
    Huron believes that he first reacts with fear towards the stimulus, then comes to enjoy 
    it by consciously recognizing that the stimulus is actually harmless.


As a result, dopamine is released giving us the pleasurable sensation of ‘excited chills’ or ‘goose bumps’. ^[4](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110112111117.htm)


Mind you this is all talking about musical Frisson, but can apply to all forms of it. There are some important points I wanted to highlight and leave you with: 

* Frisson can happen not just from music, but other sources such as emotionally intense scenes
* Frisson is a biological reaction to stimuli, and produces measurable results
* Frisson can be felt all over the body, but normally begins in the head, neck and upper chest/back area^[5](http://duncantrussell.com/forum/discussion/1442/what-is-a-frisson-hint-you-probably-experience-them-all-the-time/p1)


So if you look at a photo, read a quote, watch a scene or listen to a song and you don’t get legitimate shivers and goose bumps, then you did not experience Frisson. That’s not to say you didn't experience emotion, just not Frisson.



I hope this was informative and helped clear up some confusion surrounding just what this subreddit is about! If you have any points to add, feel free to do so!

-------------------------------------------------------------------


**TL;DR**: Frisson is a physical thing, you can feel it with shivers and goose bumps. It is not a moment of ‘oh that was nice’, it has a profound, and memorable effect.

At some point, it is late, too late, and you are standing on the sidewalk outside somewhere very loud. A wind is blowing. It’s the same cool, restless late-night breeze that blew on trampled nineteen-twenties lawns, dazed sixties streets, and anywhere young people gather. Nearby, someone who doesn’t smoke is smoking. An attractive stranger with a lightning laugh jaywalks between cars with a friend, making eye contact before scurrying inside. You’re far from home. It’s quiet. All at once, you have a thrilling sense of nowness, of the sheer potential of a verdant night with all these unmet people in it. For a long time after that, you think you’ll never lose this life, those dreams. But that was, as they say, then.

From mother, Veronique Pozner:

The sky is crying, and the flags are at half-mast. It is a sad, sad day. But it is also your day, Noah, my little man. I will miss your forceful and purposeful little steps stomping through our house. I will miss your perpetual smile, the twinkle in your dark blue eyes, framed by eyelashes that would be the envy of any lady in this room.

Most of all, I will miss your visions of your future. You wanted to be a doctor, a soldier, a taco factory manager. It was your favorite food, and no doubt you wanted to ensure that the world kept producing tacos.

You were a little boy whose life force had all the gravitational pull of a celestial body. You were light and love, mischief and pranks. You adored your family with every fiber of your 6-year-old being. We are all of us elevated in our humanity by having known you. A little maverick, who didn't always want to do his schoolwork or clean up his toys, when practicing his ninja moves or Super Mario on the Wii seemed far more important.

Noah, you will not pass through this way again. I can only believe that you were planted on Earth to bloom in heaven. Take flight, my boy. Soar. You now have the wings you always wanted. Go to that peaceful valley that we will all one day come to know. I will join you someday. Not today. I still have lots of mommy love to give to Danielle, Michael, Sophia and Arielle.

Son, love is... strange. The very first time you ever feel it, it's like a whole new world has been opened. Your head starts spinning like a propellor on a plane, your heart soaring just like that aircraft. You can construct beautiful sentences in your head, but the second you start talking to this girl, they get jumbled up and you end up stammering out a combination of mixed up words. Those words start winding around your brain and pulling a knot, making it impossible to think, and you eventually end up walking away, your cheeks as red as the blood that your heart is pumping through your body at a million beats per second. And it's beautiful.

Then years go by and love changes. Love warps and stretches until you don't even recognize it as the thing you felt back when you were 13. You look at this girl, and see the most beautiful thing on earth. Every time you see her you still get that feeling. The soaring, spinning feeling. It never leaves you, just fades away. Now love brings a smile to your face, a warm feeling to accompany the soaring in your heart, and the spinning slows down. You'd walk to the ends of the earth for her. You'd take a bullet for her in a heartbeat, and you know that this is the girl you want to spend the rest of your life with.

You live out your lives together, and after so many years the feeling you got when you first saw her still comes up occasionally, but it's almost been completely replaced with another. It's a feeling of contentment***, almost. You know that you made the right decision, and your heart is bursting with love for this woman. A feeling that will never go away, not until the end of time.

You look at your wife, your anchor, the mother of your children, your other half, and you can't imagine life without her. You squeeze her hand one last time before she closes her eyes for the last time. You can feel a part of you being ripped out of your heart, but yet, it's still there. Now love is different. Love is a gallery of memories. You love your children, but nothing will ever compare to the love you felt for your wife. And the feeling is still there, buried under layer after layer of sadness. Regret. Wishing you could have done more. But love tells you that you did everything you could. It tells you she was happy.",,False,,t5_2smzw,1375648682.0,,,True,t3_1jo5eh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1jo5eh/text_wasnt_expecting_this_from_rexplainlikeiama/,

He started it May 7th, 1987. And his last entry was May 25th, 2005. He gave me the book the year I graduated high school (shortly after his last entry). 

Today is my birthday and I tend to think fondly of that book on my birthday so I pulled it out and found the entry where he talks about me being born. I felt like sharing it:

June 13, 1987 (I guess he wrote it a few days after my birth)

*Guess what? You're here! And you're a boy! I guess you know that by now though, huh? You got here June 11th, 1987, Thursday at 5:22pm. 8 pounds, 15 ounces, 22 1/2 inches long. Whew! That's a big baby, especially since your momma's kinda small.*

*When I first saw you come out, I was absolutely amazed! I'm not quite sure how I felt. Very proud for one thing. During the first few minutes of your life, I guess I was just amazed, simply in awe. Your mom and I both were crying.* 

*All babies when they first come out are kinda blue and red and bloody and more or less look like lizards. But this was MY lizard! MY baby! MY son! I think I understood a little bit of how God must have felt when he looked upon Jesus and said ""Behold, my son in whom I am wellpleased."" In you, I am well pleased, my son. I love you so very very much.""*

(Skipping ahead a bit)

*""As I mentioned before, my father is a great man, but I wish we could have talked more intimately and been closer. If by the time you read this, I have failed you in some manner I ask that you forgive me and please not do the same with your child. I love you, Caleb. Don't ever forget or doubt that. You will always be my beloved son.""*

(Skipping a little more)

*And joy washed over me like waves upon a beach. A silent quiet joy that envelopes a person and warms his inner heart. A joy so rich. A joy too full to be wasted on laughter. My son, my joy! By the way, you are a gorgeous baby!""*


My parents divorced when I was 7. So I didn't get to see my father a lot growing up. But at the age of 26, my father and I are incredibly close. He's changed a lot over the years, all for the better, he's raised me incredibly well and I'm proud of who I am and who my father is. I hope he's still here by the time I have a child so that he can have an impact on his/her life. 

Thanks Dad.

In my two years of commuting on the F train from Essex Street to my office, there has been one constant: the man with the guitar and pan flute.

Despite boarding the train at 10 a.m., well after the rush, I would notice that his case never had more than a few singles and some change in it.

It was also quite obvious that his repertory barely stretched past the Eagles' ""Hotel California,"" along with a few other Eagles classics.

Whether for his sake or that of my fellow straphangers, I bought him a book of simple rock guitar riffs.

Two months passed and nothing came of it. Then in March, as I walked down the steps, I not only heard the Beatles (pan flute edition), but also noticed that his guitar case was far more full than usual.

He winked at me. I smiled.

&gt;Superman. It's always been Superman and it always will be. A good Superman story is hard to find. They're rare to the point that I can make a comprehensive list of them off the top of my head. But when one does come along... A good Batman story is entertaining and bad ass. And it makes you think ""Batman is cool."" A good Green Lantern story is generally fraught with emotional peril but, at the end, you'll wish you had a power ring. A good Superman story fills you with awe.
&gt;
&gt;It's the mythology of a sun god who wished he was a man because he saw something so great in us. It's the story of a hero who could move whole worlds and see through stars and hear a whisper on the other side of the planet... who fell in love with a storyteller. It's about a man and his dog. 
&gt;
&gt;Every single day, you can turn on the news and hear about something bad happening. People do terrible things to each other all the time. And, on the worst days, you might just sit down and get cynical, thinking thoughts like ""maybe we *are* inherently evil. Maybe there's just something *wrong* deep down in our hearts.""
&gt;
&gt;And then there's Superman. Looking down at the world with an unfathomable sadness. Waiting for us to join him in the sun. All the while, truly believing something only an impossible man *could* believe.
&gt;
&gt;*""If you knew how you are loved, not one of you would raise a hand in rage again.""*
&gt;
&gt;There's a psychology to storytelling. It's really quite simple. When presented with something light, we look for darkness. When presented with darkness, we look for the light. It gives a story depth. In a world without a Superman, we made one for our fiction. To guide us and make us feel brave. To let us hope.

A few weeks ago (with my therapist's approval) I weaned myself off them. I'm going to take a few months to try life without a safety net again. I don't know if you've ever taken any kind of mood stabilizers but they tend to take out the highs and the lows of emotional experiences. That is, the really bad things don't hit quite as hard, but neither do the really good things. It's a tradeoff.

Now that the drug is mostly out of my system, my force field is down and things affect me that wouldn't before. This heightened sensitivity is partly mental (I haven't felt powerful frisson in three years so even minor frisson feels hugely impactful) and will likely subside shortly. But, right now it's daily frisson (thankfully, I enjoy frisson so it's not really a bad thing, but it can be overwhelming at times).

Watching my niece and nephew play... frisson. Beautiful sunset... frisson. Sad song.... tears streaming down my face frisson. I watched ""Pitch Perfect"" the other day and I had to look away because the frisson was getting to be too much. It's goofy college comedy about an accapella group. I'm not in college, didn't love college when I was there, don't sing, and have little to no interest in acapella, and I had to look away. I hardly recognize myself.

""Damn man. That hurt just reading that. I'm on my phone but let me try to explain this the best I can. Please excuse any spelling errors or whatever. Now to explain.
My son was born mentally handicapprd. Had 9% of his brain still intact. He had a stroke at 7 months old. And was left with only 6% of his brain left. And let me tell you something. Before and after his stroke he laughed constantly. Always smiling. He knew exactly who we were. He was wonderful. I looked forward to coming home everyday to spend time wwith my son. He couldnt talk. But he didn't have to. Has face and laughs and noises said it all. He loved his family. And he could express his feelings without words. And I could express my love to him without words. But he was truly the happiest kid ever. Always happy. Always laughing. Always loving the llife he had. He was in the hospital half of his life. And even then he didn't mind as long as his family was there to support him. He died November of 2011. And let me tell you. I will NEVER be as happy as i wwas when I had him. Yes it was hard sometimes. But every second of making his milk. Changing out his feeding tube. changing out the cancer port. Carrying his wheelchair and milk pump everywhere we went was totally worth it. 20/10 would do it again forever. And i wish I had the opportunity to do it for the rest of my lifE .we never let his handicap hold us back. We went to the ocean with him and all over the US. He never held us back and loved all the traveling which is why we did it. He did more in his 4. 5 years than a lot of my friends have done in their first 30 years. We have 8000 pictures of him. And in 98% of them he's laughing or. Has a huge smile on his fface. 1% he is asleep.the other 1% is the bad times. And his whole life was like that. He was an extemely happy boy. And was in no way unhappy. And he never EVER put a burdon on us. He was the perfect little angel I miss him every second of every day. So. Yeah. I know from personal experience you are iincorrect in your opinion.""

The universe is huge. Time is impossibly vast. Trillions of creatures crawl and swim and fly through our planet. Billions of people live, billions came before us, and billions will come after. We cannot count, cannot even properly imagine, the number of perspectives and variety of experiences offered by existence.

We sip all of this richness through the very narrowest of straws: one lifetime, one consciousness, one perspective, one set of experiences. Of all the universe has, has had, and will have to offer, we can know only the tiniest fraction. We are alone and minuscule and our lives are over in a blink.
All of this strikes me as terribly sad, and if I believed Someone were in charge, I could muster an argument that our awareness of vastness makes our tininess unfair.

But here's the thing. Literature lets us experience life through a second consciousness. For a time we share the perspective and experience of the author and his imagination. Our experience of the universe is broadened, multiplied.

Without literature, we are all limited to our own lives. With it, we can know something of what it is to be other people, to walk in their shoes, to see the world their way.

Literature needs no further defense than this, I would say. It is our species's most advanced and successful technology for cheating dismal fate out of the abstract aloneness it would otherwise impose on us.",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_199bfv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/199bfv/text_what_is_the_use_of_literature_xpost_rbestof/,

The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years — imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations — not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive.”",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_1gmzme,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1gmzme/text_george_orwell_on_the_nature_of_men_and/,

1349950810.0,111,self.Frisson,11ax2v,What I think is up with r/Frisson. And an avenue to fix it.,goddamnhivemind,123,12,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/11ax2v/what_i_think_is_up_with_rfrisson_and_an_avenue_to/,"I'll try to keep this short.

Months ago there was a move against music videos. People said, ""hey, this isn't r/listentothis"". 

Then there was a bunch of solid content, like the ""Ivan the Terrible Killing His Son"" painting, among countless other sweet r/frisson submissions. 

Now, there's a bunch of other things (like the fake out-of-bounds-pass into Kobe's grill) that get some panties into a bunch. 

The problem isn't with the sub. Or with the people submitting. Or with the people voting.

The point I'm trying to make, here, is that there should be a more solid and understood definition of what ""frisson"" means. From what the side-bar says, it is a sudden sensation, like goosebumps or shivers, that comes from an epic moment. 

Perhaps we could find a definition that is less esoteric and better suits the needs of those who frequent this sub. What, exactly, are people looking for here? 

I think we are still working through what frisson actually means by posting things that make our skin tingle. Sometimes this jives with other people, and sometimes it doesn't. 

Let's figure it out. This sub is pretty cool for the most part, despite some negative people on a few recent submissions. Let's keep it afloat with things that really make you feel, well... [that way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIGJ1lekcMg). 

That's all I've got to say. Thanks for reading.

I am.

&gt;What the hell do people mean when they say ""live your life.""? It always comes off as some kind of contempt or scolding. Kind of like when my mom used to tell me about the starving kids when I couldn't eat any more of my dinner. Live your life, live your life. Life your fucking life! I AM! We all are. I keep hearing this shit and thinking, ""Fuck me! I'm not sky diving, or saving animals from slums, or feeding the poor what the fuck is wrong with me I'm wasting my everything!?""

&gt;I'm trying. I'm living. Maybe I'm not doing amazing things by the standards of others. Maybe I'm not courageous because I've never really been faced with a threat. I'm thankful I haven't. Is it shameful to be privileged enough to have food and work 9-5 and love my family and hug a cat that hasn't been saved from a ditch? Just a regular ass happy cat? Am I a coward because I didn't have to fight every day like poor Katelyn and her family? The thought of having to go through that twists my gut. Feels bad man. Have I not lived because I have not been burdened by tragedy?

&gt;You're living your life Tictacjo. And it sounds like you're doing some pretty awesome things. But your ""life advice"" is kinda crazy you know? I get what you're saying, it's said a lot, by a lot of people who are also scared. They look for meaning where there is none. I think perhaps what you were trying to say is, ""Be.""

After a while, though, when you're with it, it becomes just a… dead body, to be dealt with. It's the life that was lived that becomes important, and the continuing lives of those left here. And you realise that nobody's life has been wholly mundane. It might have been difficult or unfulfilled or full of secrets. But never dull.

The secrets tend to come out in death. Those of the individual, yes, but also of the family – and I do approach the day as one for those still living. I'm privileged to see them at their very best: death makes the living draw on enormous resources, and I learn more about human nature, kindness and resilience every day. Oh, there's a tremendous amount of emotion about, and occasionally I become the scapegoat, but very rarely. Mostly I learn about love and about the hard lives many people have led; and about sacrifice. And learn again that dying is easy. It's life that's the bloody, bloody hard work.

It's a hard job, in many ways, not least emotionally, and competitive these days – it's a cut-throat business, with the big boys and all their prepayment schemes. But people always expect aspects of depression to my job, and it's been the precise opposite. There's not a day that goes by when I don't feel happy to learn so much about humanity, to feel so in my place, and I don't regret a single minute. It has been, basically, a privilege.""

This part got me:

&gt; The bottom line, now, I’m afraid, is that as a late stage gall bladder cancer patient, I’m expected to live for ‘several months’ and it’s extremely unlikely I’ll live beyond a year.  So it looks like my latest novel, The Quarry, will be my last.
&gt;
&gt; As a result, I’ve withdrawn from all planned public engagements and I’ve asked my partner Adele if she will do me the honour of becoming my widow (sorry – but we find ghoulish humour helps).  By the time this goes out we’ll be married and on a short honeymoon.  We intend to spend however much quality time I have left seeing family. and relations and visiting places that have meant a lot to us.

In 1988, after 12 years of performing together, they felt the relationship had run its course. To end their relationship, they decided to walk the Great Wall of China, each from one end, meeting for one last big hug in the middle and then never seeing each other again.

At her 2010 MoMa retrospective Marina performed ‘The Artist Is Present’ as part of the show, where she shared a minute of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her. Ulay arrived without her knowing. The following video documents the moment.

I've had to work most Sundays, and at times my talk was rough, and sometimes I've been violent, Because the streets are awfully tough.

But I never took a penny, That wasn't mine to keep.... Though I worked a lot of overtime When the bills got just too steep.

And I never passed a cry for help, Though at times I shook with fear. And sometimes, God forgive me, I've wept unmanly tears.

I know I don't deserve a place Among the people here. They never wanted me around Except to calm their fear.

If you've a place for me here, Lord, It needn't be so grand. I never expected or had too much, But if you don't.....I'll understand.

There was silence all around the throne Where the saints had often trod. As the policeman waited quietly, For the judgment of his God.

Why do I find it more satisfying to browse the internet than have conversations?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hdcvh/why_do_i_seek_reddit_more_than_social_interaction)

&gt; It's just easier. Say you're about to read 1 thread on askreddit, 2000+ comments, yeah, that will be some good stuff. You'll read maybe 50-100 of them, ignoring comments that don't make you laugh/sad/rustle your jimmies. Old boring joke? To hell with it. Someone didn't get the reference? Yeah, tough shit, he's not gonna get your attention. A foreigner didn't quite understand the meaning of a phrase? Yeah, I suppose you could be nice and explain that to him, but... Hey, there's a new thread!

&gt; In real life you are supposed to listen to people and respond or at least acknowledge them. If a cashier asks how's your day, you can't just scroll down cause you can't be bothered to answer. If your boss is laughing at his idiotic joke, you can't just downvote him and move on. If you talk about something and your friend doesn't quite understand what you're saying, you can't just turn around and walk away.

&gt; God, writing this stuff broke my heart. Ive realised how unsocial i became since joining reddit. You know what really keeps me here? No judgments. In real life I've gotta look good, I've gotta prove that I'm confident, that I'm going somewhere in my life, that I'm happy. In real life I'm expected to be an adult.

&gt; On reddit I can sit on my couch without pants on. My facial expressions doesn't matter. I can watch cat gifs. No one asks me ""hey, what you've been up to today"", and even if they do, I can reply ""I've been watching gifs for last half an hour"". And there will be few people who will up vote me and say ""yeah, me too, haha"". Try doing it in real life and you'll automatically lose respect. You're supposed to study, to work, to exercise, to clean, to socialise, to help others.

&gt; Every now and then I impress and entertain people in real life with what I read or seen on reddit. Few times I received help from this community. But deep inside I know damn well - this is all bullshit, I'm on reddit because I'm to afraid to learn how to be happy in real life. It's so much easier here. And I'm choosing an easy way.

&gt; Reddit is that nice feeling you remember from school, when you got mildly sick and parents let you stay in bed all day. It was awesome, you felt okay-ish, played all day instead of going to school. But in the evening you realised - I missed out on life. Other people were doing things, I wasn't there. And the following morning you were anxious to go, and everyone at school seem to be so far ahead of you.

&gt;You know what, fuck that. Fuck that. I'm getting off reddit for a while. I don't wanna fucking wake up one day and tink ""I missed out, I totally missed out"".",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_1jdoum,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1jdoum/text_its_just_easier/,

That moving runway is home to nearly 5000 persons, can carry up to 75 of those aircraft (75 * 15 = 1125 tons of material) and is powered by 2 nuclear reactors, a technology we didn't even knew a hundred years ago, and can basically fuel the ship for 30 years non stop, which means it can go anywhere in the world if needed

""In 1927 Claude Friese-Greene shot some of the first-ever color film footage around London. He captured everyday life in the city with a technique innovated by his father, called Biocolour.

Though we usually think of French names like Lumiere and Melies when we think of early film pioneers, Friese-Greene’s technique captures London in striking detail, as if putting the whole city in a time capsule. The people, most now long since gone, pass before us like ghosts. What’s striking is, apart from the noticeably formal clothing and a few old cars, how familiar and unchanged everything seems. Trafalgar Square, which the film’s title card describes as “another monument to a hero of the past,” looks the same now, as does London Bridge and the London Tower.

The British Film Institute used computer enhancement to reduce the flickering effect of the original Biocolour and bring us this striking rare film which transports us back through time.""",,False,,t5_2smzw,1368892032.0,,,True,t3_1ekvzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1ekvzs/video_london_in_1927/,

The darkest evening of the year.

I had a philosophy professor who was the quintessential eccentric philosopher.  His disheveled appearance was highlighted by a well-worn tweed sport coat and poor-fitting thick glasses, which often rested on the tip of his nose. 

 Every now and then, as most philosophy professors do, he would go off on one of those esoteric and existential “what’s the meaning of life” discussions.  Many of those discussions went nowhere, but there were a few that really hit home.  This was one of them:


“Respond to the following questions by a show of hands,” my professor instructed.

“How many of you can tell me something about your parents?”  Everyone’s hand went up. 

“How many of you can tell me something about your grandparents?”  About three-fourths of the class raised their hands. 

“How many of you can tell me something about your great-grandparents?”  Two out of sixty students raised their hands. 

“Look around the room,” he said.  “In just two short generations hardly any of us even know who our own great-grandparents were.  

Oh sure, maybe we have an old, tattered photograph tucked away in a musty cigar box or know the classic family story about how one of them walked five miles to school barefoot.  But how many of us really know who they were, what they thought, what they were proud of, what they were afraid of, or what they dreamed about?  Think about that.  Within three generations our ancestors are all but forgotten.  Will this happen to you? 

“Here’s a better question.  Look ahead three generations.  You are long gone.  Instead of you sitting in this room, now it’s your great-grandchildren.  What will they have to say about you?  What will they know about you?  Or will you be forgotten, too?
“Is your life going to be a warning or an example? What legacy will you leave?  The choice is yours.  Class dismissed.”

""I was just at Subway, after smoking a little too much. As I'm standing in line getting ready to order a sandwich, an older lady walks in. I'd say, early 50's late 40's. Right upon entering, her eyes swoop over to me, and don't leave. The entire process of me and her ordering her sandwich, her eyes were on me. I started to get a little creeped out, so if figured i'd just go sit down and eat my food and ignore her.
Wouldn't you know it, she sat down 1 table past me, and facing me. We were the only two people there besides the workers, and sure enough, her eyes didn't leave me the whole time. Eventually, it got to be a little too much for me to handle, so I got up to leave. As I was standing up, she starting crying, hard.
I walked over to her at that point, being a naturally caring person. I asked her what was wrong. (struggling to speak) She replied with, ""My son died two years ago of heart problems. You look just like him. This might seem odd to you, but can I please give you a hug?""
I said yes, of course. She wasted no time. She grabbed me and squeezed hard and for a long time. And boy she just LOST it. I've never heard sobbing like it before. I heard the pain, the sadness, the memories, just, EVERYTHING in this old woman's cries.
The Subway workers saw, and even they started crying as well. I was just numb. I hugged her back and stayed strong for her. But this whole time, I was really high. And this lady gave me the biggest, strongest, most potent reality check I've ever received.
She told me she'd empty her bank account to have that same experience there again.
It really made me think about what's important in life. I guess I came here to say... Ent's, weed is great. It truly is. But don't forget what's important. Maybe instead of buying that next gram, go buy your mom some flowers or something. I spent the next hour after that calling my family and telling them how much I love them, and I hope this story inspires you to do the same.

I was determined to learn more about the Internet, to figure out ways that would help me connect with others. Using my iPhone that afternoon in August, I sent my first email message, writing an open letter that described my first hours in liberty for family.

You came home from school  
on a special bus  
full of people  
who look like you  
and love like you  
and you met me  
for the first time  
and you loved me.  
You love everybody  
so much that it's not safe  
to let you out alone.  
Eleven years of love  
and trust and time for you to learn  
that you can't go on loving like this.  
Unless you are stopped  
you will embrace every person you see.  
Normal people don't do that.  
Some Normal people will hurt you  
very badly because you do.  
Cripples don't look nice  
but you embrace them.   
You kissed a wino on the bus  
and he broke down and cried  
and he said 'Nobody has kissed me  
for the last 30 years.'  
But you did.  
You touched my face  
with your fingers and said  
'I like you.'  
The world will never  
be ready for you.  
Your way is right  
and the world will never be ready.  
We could learn everything  
that we need to know  
by watching you  
going to your special school  
in your special bus  
full of people  
who look like you  
and love like you

Daud had frozen to death months earlier. 

""We could not leave him where he was, to the Turks, because we had seen them burn alive our hapless wounded. For this reason we were all agreed, before action, to finish off one another, if badly hurt: but I had never realized that it might fall to me to kill Farraj.

I knelt down beside him, holding my pistol near the ground by his head, so that he should not see my purpose; but he must have guessed it, for he opened his eyes, and clutched me with his harsh, scaly hand, the tiny hand of these unripe Nejd fellows. I waited a moment, and he said, Daud will be angry with you’, the old smile coming back so strangely to this grey shrinking face. I replied, ‘salute him from me’. He returned the formal answer, ‘God will give you peace’, and at last wearily closed his eyes.

The Turkish trolley was now very close, swaying down the line towards us like a dung-beetle: and its machine-gun bullets stung the air about our heads as we fled back into the ridges. Mohsin led Farraj’s camel, on which were his sheepskin and trappings, still with the shape of his body in them, just as he had fallen by the bridge. Near dark we halted; and the Zaagi came whispering to me that all were wrangling as to who should ride the splendid animal next day. He wanted her for himself; but I was bitter that these perfected dead had again robbed my poverty: and to cheapen the great loss with a little one I shot the poor beast with my second bullet.

Then the sun set on us. Through the breathless noon in the valleys of Kerak the prisoned air had brooded stagnantly without relief, while the heat sucked the perfume from the flowers. With darkness the world moved once more, and a breath from the west crept out over the desert. We were miles from the grass and flowers, but suddenly we felt them all about us, as waves of this scented air drew past us with a sticky sweetness. However, quickly it faded, and the night-wind, damp and wholesome, followed. Abdulla brought me supper, rice and camel-meat (Farraj’s camel). Afterwards we slept.""",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_18rqpv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/18rqpv/text_lawrence_of_arabia_kills_his_friend_to_save/,

Watch the whole video, because it's a delightful setup for the frisson moment at the end:

&gt;What do you do with the mad that you feel?

&gt;When you feel so mad you could bite?

&gt;When the whole wide world feels oh-so-wrong

&gt;And nothing you do seems very right?

&gt;What do you do?

&gt;Do you punch a bag, do you pound some clay or some dough?

&gt;Do you round up friends for a game of tag,

&gt;Or see how fast you go?

&gt;It's great to be able to stop

&gt;When you've planned a thing that's wrong

&gt;And be able to do something else instead

&gt;And sing this song:

&gt;I can stop when I want to, can stop when I wish

&gt;Stop stop stop, anytime

&gt;And what a good feeling to feel like this

&gt;And know that the feeling is really mine

&gt;Know that there's something deep inside

&gt;That helps us become what we can.

What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?

Only the monstrous anger of the guns.

Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle

Can patter out their hasty orisons.

No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;

Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,

The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;

And bugles calling for them from sad shires.

What candles may be held to speed them all?

Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes

Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes.

The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;

Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,

And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_19kv8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/19kv8m/video_sean_bean_reads_wilfred_owens_anthem_for/,

I was reading the transcript, though, and this part was so powerful I gasped out loud and teared up:

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: There they are sitting in the classroom.  She's right there with him.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Of course she's wondering—

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: What have you've been doing for 27 years?! (Laughing.)

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: So she thinks well let me see if I can teach him some just basic sign language.  In an interesting case she takes out a book and makes the sign book.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: But the sign for book looks like opening up a book.  So he thought I was ordering him to open a book.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: So he grabs the book and he opens it.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Cuz he thought I was asking him to do something.  It was very difficult.  If I gave him the sign for standing up he thought I wanted him to stand up.  And so I couldn't, I couldn't have a conversation with him. And it was the most frustrating thing I have ever done in my life.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Wait a second, how long did this go on for?

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Well uh weeks, it was weeks.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Often times when we said goodbye or just left, (we couldn’t really say goodbye), I really believed that we wouldn't see each other again and I was often times very surprised when he would be sitting there at the table.  And I think sometimes he looked surprised that I showed up.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: But after a couple of weeks of him—

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Constantly miming, copying me.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: She had an idea.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Perhaps it's just possible that if I, if I died tomorrow I would have had only one really, really good thought in my life.  And this was it: I'm going to ignore him.

 

&gt;(Music.)

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: I taught an invisible student.  I stopped talking to him and I stopped having eye contact. And I set up an empty chair

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: And then she says she would hold up to this empty chair a picture of a cat.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: and I was trying to explain to this invisible student that this creature, a cat—so I'd be miming a cat and petting a cat—and then I’d sign the sign for cat.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Then she would hop to the other seat, the invisible student’s seat, and pretend to get it.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: ""Oh I know,” you know with my facial expression, “Oh, I get it!”

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: So you're playing all the parts.  You're both the teacher and the invisible student.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: That’s right, that’s right. 

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Doing all these crazy things and he’d just watch me.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: He stopped copying her which was good…

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: But. I’d do this over and over and over for days and days and days…

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: And she says he just didn't get it.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: He looked bored a lot of times.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: But one day in the middle of one of these endless pretend student exercises…

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Something happened.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: Out of the corner of her eye, she sees him shift his body.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: And he looked—It's interesting how his body was upright and he looked like something was about to happen. 

 

&gt;(Music.)

 

&gt;He looked around the room—this is a 27 year old man— and he looks around the room as if he had just landed from Mars and it was the first time he had ever saw anything. Something was about to happen.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: His eyes grew wider, she says, and then wider.  And then—

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: He slaps his hands on the table.  “Oh! Everything has a name!”

 

&gt;(Music.)

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: And he looks at me in this demanding way and I sign table.  And he points to the door and I sign door. And he points to the clock and he points to me, and I sign “Susan.” And then, he started crying.  He just collapsed and he started crying.

That's One Summer's Day.

Now read the text, I couldn't find a video(sadly), but here's the part that really got me in this movie.

C: ""Haku!""

H: ""Let's go.""

C: ""Where are my mom and dad?""

H: ""When you passed the test, they woke up on the human side of the 
river. They're there now. They're looking for you.""

C: ""There's no water here. I can walk across now.""

H: ""But I can't go any farther. Just go back the way you came, you'll be fine. But you have to promise not to look back, not until you've passed through the tunnel.""

C: ""What about you? What'll you do?""

H: ""Don't worry. I'll go back and have a talk with Yubaba. I'll tell her I'm going to quit being her apprentice. I'm fine. I got my name back.""

C: ""Will we meet again sometime?""

H: ""Sure we will.""

C: ""Promise?""

H: ""Promise. Now go. Don't look back.""

(Closeup of hands letting go)

Opinion: This music and scene can always make me cry, because of the emotional potency within it. Chihiro broke the spell because she loved Haku and none of them explicitly say it towards it each other, they show it through their actions. It's a pure sort of love, the one unhindered by adult entanglement. This last scene is incredibly revealing in their innocence and their final goodbye. We know, as the audience, that they will never meet again. It's possible that they know as well. Instead, they carry a short conversation in which they both try to ensure their future lives will be happy. It's only at the last moment do their feelings come up to the surface again.

TL;DR: Two kids love each other innocently, never get a chance to really enjoy it. The kind of love everyone wants but never has.",,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,t3_1hdec8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1hdec8/musictextspirited_away/,

I was sitting out there, when the water around me went dark,” said Troy. “I thought it was a shadow from a cloud passing by the sun, so I remember looking up, but there were no clouds.”

Then he saw it. “I looked down and saw the profile of a big shark underneath me, and I realised what was happening, and started paddling towards the beach. The shark was inside of me, under me somewhere, but between me and the beach.”

It was about then that things started to get interesting. “As I was paddling, this tiny little fin appeared next to me. It just got bigger and bigger, as the dorsal fin started rising out of the water. It was to the right of me, cruising past me, going so slowly, heading out to sea. It was so close. At this stage I started getting really scared, you know, all these thoughts start going through your head. My 14-year-old boy was on the beach, and everything was happening so fast.”
The shark swam past, but then the nightmare started. “I checked the shark splash behind me, and do a u-turn, and I was thinking, ‘this can’t be happening. This can’t be happening.’ It was like a dreamy thing, almost like an out-of-body experience as I could actually see a shark attack about to happen. To me. I was thinking “This shark is going to kill me now.”

The shark hit Troy hard from underneath. “It hit me so hard and so fast. It hit me on the left side; hit the board by my hip. I got flung up and rolled over, and the next thing the shark was on top of me. I had my arm wrapped around the tail of the shark. It was like we were hugging each other for a second. We got tangled up in the leash, and the next thing the shark was pulling me under water hard.”

Troy got sucked under the water, still attached to the board that was somehow entangled with the shark. “It pulled me under until the leash snapped. I had swallowed so much water in the struggle, and water was rushing up my nose from being pulled under.”
Troy surfaced. The shark was nowhere to be seen. Neither was his board.

“I was about 80 meters out, maybe more, and I started swimming to the shore without my board, just expecting the shark to hit any second. I swam some freestyle and then I swam backstroke, just to keep my eye out for when it was going to hit, to fight it off if I could. As I came towards the shore I saw something dark in the water but it was a rock, and I remember standing on it, looking out to sea, feeling a bit safer. Probably wouldn’t have made any difference whatsoever if it had come back, but for some reason I felt a bit secure on it.”

Troy continued swimming. “I was swimming regularly, not splashing and panicking. I tried to stand a few times, but I was still too deep, so just kept on swimming. It was only when I could stand on the sand did I feel safe again. I was totally numb, from the shock, but I was OK. A few little cuts and stuff. The strangest thing was walking back to my family without a board. ”

Troy was still alive. Shaken, in a bit of a state, but totally unharmed.“ I went for a surf the next day,” said Troy on his rehab process. “I just managed one wave before I came in. It felt strange.”

Now, imagine if we had a computer that could pump all of those out, and analyze each one for facial recognition, etc. You could plug in ""Milla Jovovich boxing Muhammad Ali"" and you'd have *every* image of boxing *ever* taken, just with Milla Jovovich wearing trunks and fighting Ali.

Maybe Ali has lobster claws instead of hands. And he's firing lasers out of his eyes.

Blew my mind to think about that for a while.
