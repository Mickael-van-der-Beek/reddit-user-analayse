**What do you think is the most underrated philosophical argument, article or book that you have encountered (especially works in the philosophy of language and / or the philosophy of mind)? -twin_me**

&gt;There are many, going back to classical antiquity.  One is Aristotle’s observation about the meanings of simple words.   His example was the definition of “house,” though he put it in metaphysical rather than cognitive terms, a mistaken direction partially rectified in the 17th century.  In his framework, a house is a combination of matter (bricks, timber, etc.) and form (design, intended use, etc.).  It follows that the way the word is used to refer cannot be specified in mind-independent terms.  Aristotle’s account of form only scratches the surface.  Further inquiry shows that it is far more intricate, and somehow known to every child without evidence, raising further questions.  Extending these observations (which to my knowledge apply to almost every simple word), we can conclude, I believe, that the “referentialist doctrine” that words have extensions that are mind-independent is wrong, undermining a lot of standard philosophy of language and mind, matters pretty well understood in 17th century philosophy – and also, incidentally, bringing up yet another crucial distinction between humans and other animals.  That leads us naturally to Descartes.  Many of his basic insights I think have been misunderstood or forgotten, for example the central role he assigned to what has been called “the creative aspect of language use,” his provocative ideas about the role of innate ideas (geometrical forms, etc.) in the first stages of perception, and much else.

**In your mind, what would it take to prove universal grammar wrong? -mythrilfan**

&gt;In its modern usage, the term “universal grammar” (UG) refers to the genetic component of the human language faculty – for example, whatever genetic factors make it possible for us to do what we are doing now.  It would be proven wrong if it is shown that there is no genetic factor that distinguishes humans from, say, apes (who have approximately the same auditory system), songbirds, etc.  In short, it would take a discovery that would be a biological miracle.
There is massive confusion about this.   Consider, for example, the widely-held idea (for which there is no support whatsoever, and plenty of counter-evidence) that what we are now doing is just the interplay of cognitive capacities available generally, perhaps also to other primates.  If true, then UG would be the complex of genetic factors that bring these alleged capacities together to yield what we are doing – how, would remain a total mystery.
There are plenty of other confusions about UG.  For example, one often reads objections that after 50 years there is still no definite idea of what it is, a condition that will surely extend well into the future.  As one can learn from any standard biology text, it is “fiendishly difficult” (to quote one) to identify the genetic basis for even vastly simpler “traits” than the language capacity.

**Professor Chomsky, it has been maintained for decades that human language is outside the scope of context-free languages. This has been supported by arguments which consider crossing dependencies and movement, among other phenomena, as too complex to be handled by a simple context-free grammar. What are your thoughts on grammar formalisms in the class of mildly-context sensitive languages, such as Combinatory Categorial Grammars and Ed Stabler's Minimalist Grammars? -surrenderyourego**

&gt;Some crucial distinctions are necessary.

&gt;My work on these topics in the 1950s (Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory – LSLT; Syntactic Structures – SS) maintained that human language is outside the scope of CF grammars and indeed outside the scope of unrestricted phrase structure grammars – Post systems, one version of Turing machines (which does not of course deny that the generative procedures for language fall within the subrecursive hierarchy).  My reasons relied on standard scientific considerations: explanatory adequacy.  These formalisms provide the wrong notational/terminological/conceptual framework to account for simple properties of language.  In particular, I argued that the ubiquitous phenomenon of displacement (movement) cannot be captured by such grammars, hence also the extremely marginal matter of crossing dependencies.
The question here does not distinguish sharply enough between formal languages and grammars (that is, generative procedures).  The issues raised have to do with formal languages, in technical terms with weak generative capacity of grammars, a derivative and dubious notion that has no clear relevance to human language,  for reasons that have been discussed since the ‘50s.
Any theory of language has to at least recognize that it consists of an infinite array of expressions and their modes of interpretation.  Such a system must be generated by some finite generative process GP (or some counterpart, a matter that need not concern us).  GP strongly generates the infinite array of expressions, each a hierarchically structured object.  If the formal language furthermore has terminal strings (some kind of lexicon), GP will weakly generate the set of terminal strings derived by additional operations that strip away the hierarchical structure.  It could well be that the correct GP for English weakly generates every arrangement of elements of English.  We may then go on to select some set of these and call them “grammatical,” and call that the language generated.  
As discussed in LSLT and brought up in SS, the selection seems both arbitrary and dubious, even in practice.  As linguists know well, a great deal can be learned about language by study of various types of “deviance” – e.g., the striking distinction between subjacency and ECP violations.  Hence in two respects, it’s unclear that weak generative capacity tells us much about language: it is derivative from strong generation, a linguistically significant notion; and it is based on an arbitrary and dubious distinction.
Study of weak generation is an interesting topic for formal language theory, but again, the relevance to natural language is limited, and the significant issues of inadequacy of even the richest phrase structure grammars (and variants) lies elsewhere: in normal scientific considerations of explanatory adequacy, of the kind discussed in the earliest work.  Further discussion would go beyond limits appropriate here, but I think these comments hold also for subcases and variants such as those mentioned, though the inquiries often bring up interesting issues.


**For the greater part of five decades, your work in linguistics has largely dictated the direction of the field. For better or worse, though, you've got to retire at some point, and the field will at some point be without your guiding hand. With that in mind, where do you envision the field going after your retirement? Which researcher(s) do you see as taking your place in the intellectual wheelhouse of linguistics? Do you think there will ever be another revolution, where some linguist does to your own work what you once did to Bloomfield's? -morphemeaddict** 


&gt;That’s quite an exaggeration, in my opinion.  It’s a cooperative enterprise, and has been since the ‘50s, increasingly so over the years.  There’s great work being done by many fine linguists.  I could list names, but it would be unfair, because I’d necessarily be omitting many who should be included.  Much of my own work has to be revised or abandoned – in fact I’ve been doing that for over 50 years. This is, after all, empirical science, not religion, so there are constantly revisions and new ideas.  And I presume that will continue as more is learned.  As to where it should or will go from here, I have my own ideas, but they have no special status.

* *fjalla* means “mountain”. The direct modern English cognate is *fell* (a mountain or high plateau).

* *jökull* means “glacier”. The Old English cognate was *gicel*, which survives in modern English as the *-icle* ending of “icicle”.

""Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo""
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)

and ""James, while John had had 'had', had had 'had had'; 'had had' had had a better effect on the teacher""
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher). 

Then my housemate and I thought: what if we combined the two sentences? Could an even more confusing sentence be made? The answer appears to be an emphatic 'yes'. 

Here is our first attempt:

'Buffalo buffalo that buffalo Buffalo buffalo that buffalo Buffalo buffalo, while Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo that buffalo Buffalo buffalo had had “Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo”, had had “James, while John had had 'had', had had 'had had'; 'had had' had had a better effect on the teacher”; “James, while John had had 'had', had had 'had had'; 'had had' had had a better effect on the teacher” had had a better effect on the Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo that buffalo Buffalo buffalo than “Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo” had had on the Buffalo buffalo.'

A sentence to buffalo anyone... Kudos to anyone who can work out what it means!

PS: If you like that sentence, we have an even more confusing one waiting for you!

1317654301.0,171,self.linguistics,kzegt,Who would be interested in an informal Reddit course on phonetics/phonology?,Kinbensha,192,21,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/kzegt/who_would_be_interested_in_an_informal_reddit/,"Someone just bought me my second month of Reddit Gold for standing up for linguistics out in the wild, and I thought it was about time I give back to r/linguistics.

I always talk about how phonetics and phonology are my thing, but I noticed that a lot of readers on r/linguistics don't have a strong grasp of phonology. In fact, some of you say that you can't read IPA. I'd like to help change that, if I can. I've taught introductory linguistics classes before, so I have no doubt I could put something together for phonetics/phonology. I would offer to do other things, but I don't really enjoy them and I think you would learn best from someone who is passionate about those specific subjects.

So here's the deal. I can start with how I taught the beginnings of phonology in an Intro to Linguistics course. After that's done, I can go through a rough version of an undergraduate phonology course with some phonetics mixed in. I've never taught an undergraduate phonology course, but I'm pretty confident I can at least mimic my own undergraduate course and answer any questions.

Currently the only thing I'm upset at myself about is that I threw out all my phonology worksheets from undergraduate a long time ago, so I don't have a list of datasets to use in phonology problems (although I do still have my answer sheets, so maybe I can backtrack and get a partial dataset with enough info to basically work). If someone could private message me who has access to something similar or any resource I could use for that, that would be great. I wouldn't feel good saying, ""Here's yet another constructed dataset for a fictional language!"" for every lesson, or having to read through a phonology paper on a random language to look for transcriptions and their meanings in various languages.

What do you guys think? I can't guarantee the ""lessons"" would come very quickly, as I do have a job teaching English, and I must admit that I speak American English, so I would have to look up examples for British/Australian/Canadian English unless there are other Redditors who speak those dialects and would be willing to give a short summary in the comments on how their ""national"" dialect differs.

**tl;dr: You want to learn some phonetics/phonology? Let me know.**

Edit: Well, I've seen enough interest already to know that this would be something worth doing. I'll start putting together the first lesson. In the meantime, here's a little something to look over and listen to for fun and learning. [Clickable IPA charts](http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/course/chapter1/chapter1.html) with sound recordings. Also, here's an [easy way to copy and paste IPA symbols](http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/pickers/ipa/).

What does Yoda's syntax look like in non-English versions of Star Wars?  For those who aren't familiar with Star Wars (all two of you), Yoda is an alien who, when speaking English, uses what seems to be an OSV syntax instead of the traditional SVO syntax.  

So how do foreign translations of the script handle this?  I am particularly interested in what it looks like in non-SVO languages.  Are there any translations where Yoda's incorrect syntax is emulated by using an English-like syntax?  Or are other languages' syntax so free that mistakes in the use of case or verb conjugations must instead be used to emulate Yoda's ""alien"" speech?

Does anyone have any information about how Yoda speaks in non-English versions of Star Wars?

**EDIT:**  We've gotten some great and informative responses from many of you, and I'm going to compile a list of Yoda's syntax in foreign languages.  I am still welcoming responses concerning other languages, and any information about Yoda's syntax in ""exotic"" or non-SVO languages (i.e. Chinese, Finnish, Persian) is particularly appreciated.

**The Master List so far...**

* Czech:  Free word order.  Yoda speaks consistently in SOV.  Interestingly enough, putting an object before a verb does sound unusual to most speakers of Czech.  

* Estonian:  Free word order language.  Yoda retains the English OSV order.  This is grammatical in Estonian, but does make it seem as though Yoda is constantly stressing the object phrase as the main point of his statements.  This gives his speech an unusual quality.

* French: An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.

* German:  A SVO or SOV language.  Yoda brings the Object to the front (OSV), like in English.

* Hungarian:  A free word order language.  There is nothing unusual about Yoda's speech.

* Italian:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.  Note: OSV is also the syntax used in the Italian of the less-proficient speakers of Italian from the region of Sardinia.  

* Japanese: An SOV language.  Yoda seems to use a more or less correct syntax, with a more archaic vocabulary.  

* Korean:  An SOV language.  Nothing is unusual about Yoda's grammar.

* Norwegian:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.

* Romanian:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.  He also places adjectives before the noun instead of after the noun, and uses an archaic form of the future tense.  

* Spanish:  An SVO language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.

* Turkish:  An SOV language.  Yoda speaks in OSV.  Note:  This order is also used in classical Ottoman poetry, so the syntax may have been chosen in order to emphasize Yoda's wisdom or age.

For us, going back a little farther, into the Middle English period, things get tougher, but it still mostly feels like reading an older version of the same language, however, to modern speakers, Old English tends to sound almost like a foreign language, more like German than English, mainly due to things like word order, inflections, and Germanic vocabulary which hasn't survived to the modern day.

However, since there wasn't a point at which everyone stopped speaking Old English and started speaking Middle English, would Middle English speakers more easily engage with Old English as an older version of their language like  we can do with Middle English? Would they throw case endings onto their nouns if they wanted to sound ""old-timey"" like we do with thee/thy/thou and understand those endings even though they no longer used them in normal speech?

""Yes"" and ""no"" are both equally common and equally important words in any language, so why should either of them be subject to so much change when they are so essential in any language's vocabulary?  More importantly, why should ""yes"" change or be replaced so frequently while ""no"" has been so well-conserved over Indo-European's millenia-long history?  Furthermore, I am curious to know if the tendency to conserve the same word for ""no"" while frequently replacing the word for ""yes"" is common in other families.

Aside from its direction-related meanings (as in ""right hand""), it also means *correct*, *just*, *true*, *appropriate*.

This is also the case with some other IE languages:

- In Latin, the adjective [*dexter*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dexter) means not only ""that is on the right"" but also *skillful*, *fortunate*, *favorable*, *proper*, *fitting*. Italian [*destro*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/destro) seems to have inherited some of these meanings.

- The French and Spanish words for ""right"" (""droit"" and ""derecho"" respectively) both originate from Latin ""directus"", which originally meant *straight* and *direct* but not *right*.

- Finally, some additional positive meanings seem to be present in Russian (see [*pravyj*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9)).

And as expected, the opposite (left = bad) also holds in some languages: see Latin [*laevus*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/laevus) and [*sinister*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sinister) (also borrowed in English) and Russian [*levyj*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9).

So in conclusion, it appears that there is something inherently positive about the right side and negative about the left. Personally, I have absolutely no clue how to explain that, but I hope someone here will. Perhaps all these connotations originated in a single language (Greek? Latin?) and were later borrowed into others? Even if that's the case, what could the original reason be? Examples (including counter-examples) in other languages, especially non-IE, will also be appreciated.

This is lazy pseudolinguistics and will not be allowed on this subreddit.  If you're going to make one of these maps, please put in the time to do it properly.

If you need any help, we link to sources on the sidebar, which you can use for etymological queries (i.e. don't submit them here unless you've tried them first!).",,False,self,t5_2qhos,False,,,True,t3_1ihre4,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1ihre4/meta_on_making_and_submitting_etymology_maps/,moderator

We welcome your input, and we'd like to maintain /r/linguistics as a professional subreddit along the lines of /r/askscience and /r/answers.

We would like to eventually ban the following:

*   advice animals/image macros (memes okay for discussion only)
*   translation requests
*   blogspam 
*   examples of ""poor"" language/spelling grammar.
*   reposts without anything added to the discussion.

Moreover: 

* Linked posts should go to the original scientific article, not a news article based on the post. Youtube videos should link directly to youtube and not some blogspam site.

* /r/linguistics should not be for questions that could be otherwise googled.  If you want to discuss something, you should show you've done some homework by including a scientific article or two.  

* This is not the place to post and ridicule examples of ""poor"" grammar/spelling/language.

For example, I thought screaming is always nonverbal. So you can say ""Joe yelled 'Stop'!"" or ""Joe shouted 'Stop!'"" but you can't say ""Joe screamed 'Stop!"". But Google shows lots of results for people ""screaming"" words.

Does ""Joe yelled out 'Stop!'"" mean something different than ""Joe yelled 'Stop!""? What about ""shout out""?

Dictionary definitions are helpful but I still feel like I'm always choosing the wrong word. I don't think the equivalent ASL signs translate easily to any English word, and ASL is probably not well-suited to distinguishing sounds in the first place for obvious reasons.

Can anybody give me some rules on when to use each word?

If someone has some thoughts on when I should use the word ""grunt"", I'd appreciate that too.

As of this morning I haven't been able to understand a lick of english when it's spoken to me, and I have no idea why. My dad speaks spanish unless there's guests around, so didn't even realize the issue til I started getting phone calls from people and I wasn't able to understand what they were saying.


On TV I can only understand a bit of Scarface on AMC right now without subtitles. Songs are pretty much gibberish til I look at the lyrics. 


I can understand spoken spanish, italian, and french still. Just not english... What causes this to happen if anyone else has experienced it? There's not much on Google so how does it go away?

I thought it would be nice to be able to make one myself, for example with the word ""german"". It doesn't take much, right? Just time and a dictionary...

In order to save time in case I want to make a lot of different maps, I wrote this Python script. You need to have in the same directory:

* [the script (makeMap.py)](http://speedy.sh/w4pgm/makeMap.py)

* [the template (europe_template.svg)](http://speedy.sh/WwFU6/europe-template.svg)

* [the dictionary (dictionary_german.txt)](http://speedy.sh/hWqHP/dictionary-german.txt)

The dictionary file must look like:

    eng	german	red

    est	saksa	orange

    eus	german	red
    ...

The first column being the name of the language in the ISO 639-3 system (not hard to figure it out), the second column is the word you want to map in the corresponding language, and the third column is the color you want to use. On a Unix system you just need to run:

    ./makeMap.py dictionary_german.txt



I still miss a few things. I didn't find the translation in Karelian and in Gagauz, and I don't know the transcription in Arabic.
Also, Serbia/Bosnia/Croatia are bound to have the same color her, because the template is so, and I didn't modify it. And I don't know anything about caucasian languages.

I would like to add optional regional languages (Veneto/Piemontese/Napoletano/Sicilianu/Occitan/Scots/Manx/Breton etc) fiddling with the template.

Any input welcome!

As the title suggests, I've just developed a linguistically-oriented card game/party game as a [free-to-print-and-play PDF](http://www.ltaggame.com). Players compete and co-operate to generate offensive yet grammatical English sentences by combining lexicalized partial syntactic trees. It is easy to learn and play and can be enjoyed by anyone, linguist or not.

Assuming people like it, the plan is to eventually take it to Kickstarter and try to get real professional copies printed so you can keep it on your shelf next to your copy of *Barriers* and Hudson's *Sociolinguistics* and play with your friends. But first I just wanted to share it for free to see if people enjoy it, or to see if it has any big issues. It would just mean the absolute world to me if my friends here at /r/linguistics would check it out. Like I said, you don't have to like or study syntax to enjoy it, but everyone here will enjoy its LaTeX-y, formal linguistics paper vibe aesthetics.

You can download the PDF for free at [www.LTAGgame.com](http://www.LTAGgame.com), and follow us on Twitter [@LTAGgame](http://www.twitter.com/LTAGgame) and [www.facebook.com/LTAGgame](http://www.facebook.com/LTAGgame).

Karaoke. As simple as that. I want to  be able to find karaoke cd's, or a karaoke like product (could even be youtube videos!) that, instead of teaching language through instruction, teaches it through song. There's some more specifics to it, but this is the jist of it. I know karaoke CD's exist in other languages, but it'd be nice to find a convenient one stop marketplace with the curation done by fluent bilinguals looking to make a buck (or your currency of choice).

**The most profound idea...**

Idea #2:

A website that allows you to enter the vocabulary words you know in a language, which it then algorithmically finds articles on the internet that includes the words you know, while introducing new ones at a rate of 10-20% per article.

With each article, the new words are included, with definition at the bottom in your native language, and perhaps even includes an updated mnemosyne/supermemo/anki flash card stack.

I would pay for this! On a monthly basis, and I think hundreds of thousands of people would too. Entire institutions would probably adopt it almost immediately. Think of the power... It would allow people to *immediately* start engaging and using the language they're learning from day one in a very natural and progressive manner. This could revolutionize the way people learn articles and there is technology that is similar in nature that exists already. See [copyscape](http://www.copyscape.com/) (it's a site that checks or plagiarism in bodies of text).

Why has this not been done yet? The best reason I can come up with, in my mind, is that the right people possessing the right skills simply haven't had the stroke of insight.

*What do you guys think?*

**Addendum for idea #2:**

So everyone seems to dig the second idea. Perhaps the most sensible way to use this product/website is from *day one* of starting to learn a new language, in which case, a really sensible way to find the initial vocab words to learn it would be cool to plug in an article, in your native language, on a subject you're really interested in, and it pull out the top *translated* words you'd need to understand a similar article in the language you're going to pick it up in. This could help to start that initial entry of vocab words that would be awkward to get the ball rolling.

In addition, perhaps as a way to ""set the initial bar"" for vocab the app/website could show a body of text and let a person click the words that they either do or do not understand. This might make more sense than manual entry. This might even be more useful/intuitive to use than the suggestion in the paragraph immediately prior to this one.",,False,self,t5_2qhos,True,,,True,t3_dvtj7,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/dvtj7/ive_had_a_vision_of_two_language_learning/,

I thought I would take the opportunity to make this first post more of an introduction rather than a lesson, lesson. Think of it as the first day of a class in university. I'm going to take some time to go over some basic ideas, explain some of the differences between phonetics and phonology, and provide you all with some useful resources that should help you figure out your own dialects and deal with IPA. Please bear with me, as I've never taught a ""class"" online before, and I'm sure you'll have to ask plenty of questions if I'm vague. I'll do anything I can to clear up misunderstandings or fix my wording to make it more accessible. I'm going to assume that the people reading this have very varied backgrounds in linguistics and phonetics/phonological knowledge. It's something I'll have to try to deal with, but I'm going to try to keep it simple for those who may have no background at all. Also, I've decided to make them quite long apparently...

Also, I need to figure out a way to receive delicious karma for these posts :)

So, without further delay, let's discuss what in the world phonetics and phonology are anyway.

**Phonetics**

Phonetics is, in many ways, the foundation of language (both spoken and signed). Phonetics deals with the smallest units in language, individual sounds themselves. Linguists will sometimes refer to individual sounds as *phones*. When someone says ""a 't' sound,"" that's a phone. Words in spoken languages are made up of collections of phones.

When dealing with phonetics, rather than phonology, it's important to remember that not all ""t sounds"" are alike. Every instance of you making a particular phone is different. Likewise, the way you make your [t] may be different from someone else. When we use the [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (which I'll go over later) to transcribe sounds, we're more saying that they're *similar enough* rather than they're exactly the same.

The idea we just touched on relates to *articulatory phonetics*. That is, the study of how sounds are formed in the vocal tract. The most minute difference in mouth shape can and will affect the acoustics of a sound. Often, you won't hear the difference because, if it's not meaningful, your brain has adapted to ignore it. However, just because something ""sounds the same"" doesn't mean that it is. Articulatory phonetics also covers wider things than just minute differences- it also covers, for example, the articulatory difference between a [t] ""t sound"" and a [k] ""k sound."" Using phonetics terms, you can describe how these sounds are the same and how they are different. This is an integral part of phonology as well.

Personally, I do a lot of work with [spectrograms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrograms). Spectrograms relate to *acoustic phonetics*, which is more or less about measuring various characteristics of individual sounds. Some things we can learn from spectrograms include levels of [aspiration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant) (puffs of air after a consonant), voicing (vibrations of the vocal folds - the difference between [t] and [d]), and for vowel quality (basically where the vowel is made in the mouth and what vowel it actually is, acoustically).

So we've looked at how sounds are made and the characteristics of those sounds. Then there's *auditory phonetics*, which relates to how listeners perceive sounds. Listeners are always tuning out unnecessary phonetic data, and in some cases interpret completely different phones as the same sound. A good example of this is when you hear two sounds in a foreign language that native speakers insist are different, but they sound exactly the same to you. This is strongly related to phonology, and as you probably know, it's impossible to completely separate phonetics and phonology. They do, however, work on different ""planes"" of linguistics. Let's talk about phonology and it should become a bit more apparent.

**Phonology**

If phonetics is all about cold, hard data, then phonology is about theory. Phonetics deals with phones, which are our best description of a real, acoustic sound that has been recorded. Phonology, on the other hand, introduces the idea of a *phoneme*. A [phoneme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) is defined as the smallest unit of sound capable of forming meaningful contrast.

What does that mean? It means that two words with different meanings can differ only in a single sound. For example, ""bat"" and ""cat"" differ only in their first consonant. That means that that those two consonants must be separate sounds in the minds of speakers. It's a bit more complicated than that, but this will do for now.

So, what's the difference between a *phone* and a *phoneme*? A phoneme is a mental representation of a sound or group of related sounds in a speaker's mental inventory of sounds. Every language has a *phoneme inventory*, a list of available sounds used to contrast meaning. This forms a sound system. In this theoretical sound system, phonemes influence one another and can change each other into other sounds.

Phonologists look at cold, hard data (phonetics) and then try to see what forms meaningful differences in a language. They group phones together that represent a single sound to native speakers of that language. We'll cover that more later.

So we said that phones are cold, hard sounds. Acoustic facts. You can look at a computer monitor and say, ""Yep, that's voiced"" (usually...). Phonemes are theoretical constructs used to discuss the sound systems of languages that utilize contrasting sounds. Phones and phonemes come together when we discuss *allophones*. Allophones are a phonetic variant of a phoneme, conditioned by its environment (surrounding sounds).

The best example I can provide for this comes from American English. As some of you may know, Americans often have a unique way to pronounce the ""t"" in ""water."" Phonemically, linguists refer to the *underlying form* of the ""t"" in ""water"" as /t/ with / slashes. This means the sound is grouped as a ""t"" in the sound system of the language/dialect. Phonetically, or the *surface representation*, you know that it's not really a ""t"" sound. People describe it as a ""soft d,"" but we're linguists dammit. We're going to call it what it is- a flap or tap [ɾ]. [] brackets are used for phonetic transcriptions rather than underlying forms. Don't worry about the IPA symbol for now. Just realize that it's not a [t], and that the /t/ is expressed outwardly as a [ɾ]. That's an allophone, and an important word for our next few lessons. (I should also add that the [t] in ""tip"" is also an allophone of /t/. An allophone need not be a completely different sound.)

**Homework-ish Stuff**

Consider the definitions of the following words:

*Phonetics*

*Phonology*

*Phone*

*Phoneme*

*Allophone*

Which discipline (phonetics or phonology) do the following best fit into?

Certain consonants are more aspirated in English than in Spanish.

In Japanese, /t/ is pronounced as [ts] before a certain vowel.

In the Creek language, vowels are made more towards the center of the mouth (centralized) when at the end of the word.

To answer these questions, 4000 sample sentences were collected and analyzed.

**Method**

1. *Sample collection.* I used a script to crawl the top fifty links in a selection of subreddits twice per day for one week. Each time the script found a new link, it searched the comments page for sentences containing either *its* or *it's*. To prevent a single, atypical comment section from skewing the results (e.g. a link in /r/games that had reached the front page of /r/all), the script selected a maximum of one sample at random from the results of each search. A total of 3,898 samples were collected.

2. *Sentence categorization.* I created a web application (now offline) that allowed users to categorize sentences and then solicited help from /r/grammar. Each sentence was marked by two users. If the two graders agreed (99.1% of cases), the sample was sorted into one of five categories: (1,2) possessive, has/does not have apostrophe, (3,4) contraction, has/does not have apostrophe and (5) bad sample. If the graders disagreed, the sentence was flagged for review.

First, some statistics on the generous /r/grammar subscribers who helped out.

* Exactly one hundred people contributed to the project, categorizing 7,802 sentences in under 24 hours. The median grader marked 21 sentences.

* Graders had a disagreement rate of just 0.9%.

* Fans of the [Pareto Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) will enjoy the fact that the top twenty graders marked 80.01% of the sentences.

That is to say, the vowels are distributed throughout the chart in a fairly regular way. Mostly, this means if you have a front vowel, there's usually a corresponding back vowel, and there's something close to the minimum amount of height levels for the number of vowels in the inventory. 

The [Turkish vowel chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Turkish_vowel_chart.svg/500px-Turkish_vowel_chart.svg.png) looks a little funny, but when you realize that Turkish vowel phonemes are defined by +/- Height, Backness and Roundness, it makes sense - all the possible combinations of those three variables are represented.

But I've been looking into Manchu (specifically Literary, or Classical Manchu) lately. And I come across this:

[Manchu Vowels](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Manchu_Vowel_Chart.svg/500px-Manchu_Vowel_Chart.svg.png).

four different vowel heights on 6 vowels?

only one front vowel, two central vowels, and 3 back vowels, all differentiated only by height?

[wat.](http://i.imgur.com/COhrwsa.jpg)

First thought - ""this can't be right."" But I found [this source](http://www.manjurist.net/Thesis_Final.pdf), which uses Latin-speaking, French-speaking, Mandarin-speaking and Korean-speaking sources contemporary to when Classical Manchu was spoken and yep, this is about right.

Second thought - ""well, maybe it's like Turkish, and maybe it's just a matter of lining up the right binary articulatory features, actual articulation be damned!"" But *nooo!* Guess which vowels form a natural class (due to vowel harmony)?

* ""Yang"" class - /ʊ/, /ɔ/, /a/
* ""Yin"" class - /ə/, /u/
* Neutral - /i/

So, in other words, [this](http://i.imgur.com/9DdMWw4.png).

[wat.](http://i.imgur.com/2nLidBQ.jpg)

Manchu vowels *also* harmonize over rounding, but are divided up in a more predictable way (/ʊ/, /ɔ/, /u/ are round, rest are not, as would be expected).

Then I stumbled across [this paper](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~dresher/papers/BLSManchu.pdf), which attempted to try to figure out what in the flying hell was going on with this. Hypothesis? The Yin/Yang distinction is one of Advanced Tongue Root (ATR). ""Yang"" vowels are [-ATR], ""Yin"" vowels are [+ATR]. Problem is, /i/ is pretty clearly [+ATR], yet it doesn't act like it! It acts like it doesn't have [ATR] specified at all!

The only way the Dresher and Zhang manage to get it all to work is to come up with an incredibly convoluted hierarchy of the articulatory features [Low], [Coronal], [Labial], and [ATR].

Okay, so that was my [WTF am I reading?](http://i.imgur.com/Ga175pp.jpg) of the day. 

So, have any of you guys come across any weirder vowel systems?

Obviously I'm proud of finishing my MA, and I'm proud of the study that I did, which is part of my motivation for posting here to reddit. However I also wanted to provide any interested parties the opportunity to ask me questions about either the research or the process of acquiring my MA (I also have a previous BA in Applied Linguistics).

I'm now carrying on to a degree in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP). This change in direction is partially motivated by the medical bent of my research interests, but also by the need to have reliable long-term employment. I have a number of friends/colleagues with research PhDs in LING that are having trouble finding work right now.

Finally: I won't be offended if nobody reads the thesis - it's quite a bear. If anyone does, feel free to poke holes and ask questions, either privately or via PM. There are absolutely issues / limitations with this study, but I hope that it has added some value to the (small) community of researchers in language and mental health.

Is it due to phonoaesthetic reasons, does it have to do with some intrinsic property of the colours, or is it just because ""black and white"" happened to catch on as a stock phrase?

I was wondering if it's possible to order the most common English colour adjectives c(1), c(2), c(3), etc. such that for any x and y, iff x&lt;y, ""c(x) and c(y)"" will be more common than ""c(y) and c(x)"".

4. Black
5. Blue

This is surprising, because whatever language this word was borrowed from (be it Greek, Latin, or French), probably used the phone [k]. 

This consonant is already readily available in Arabic's phonemic inventory, so why would democracy and similar European words have their [k] sounds replaced with a [q]?

**EDIT**  

Not to answer my own question, but I think I had an epiphany.  Those of you who are not very well-versed in Arabic may need some explaining.  Ignoring long vowels, Arabic has three vowel phonemes: /æ/, /i/, and /u/.   In most cases, they are realized as such, but certain so-called ""emphatic"" consonants have a centralizing effect on nearby vowels.  Depending on the speaker, these vowels would be realized as something along the lines of [a], [ɛ], or [o] when pronounced after this special class of consonant.  

So what's the point?  Well, if I'm not mistaken, [q] can have such an effect on a vowel.  If an Arabic speaker were to use [k] in his borrowed loanword, the best Arabic approximation for the o-like vowel in democracy would be [u].  However, using a [q] would centralize this vowel to something closer to [o].  It would seem as though Arabic had a choice between preserving the European consonant, [k]; and preserving the European vowel, [o].  

I guess they went with the vowel.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhos,1343686603.0,,,True,t3_xerq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/xerq1/why_does_arabic_use_q_in_european_loanwords_when/,

that havoc can do is be wreaked

* Btw I was thinking about the ""ea"" vowel changes is English. How
""break"" and ""meat"" each changed from a similar sound that was
different from both of them and it hit me: breakfast. Cool, huh?

All of them merit discussion, but I think the last one is the coolest. When you say ""breakfast,"" you're essentially invoking 600 year-old phonology, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift). (The æ in ""fast"" becoming ə has more to do with the fact that it's not the stressed syllable, in my unscientific opinion.)

At home, we speak to her mostly in Arabic, at the nursery everyone speaks English, and for the past six months or so a Mandarin tutor has been coming in for an hour three times a week.  Since she's so young the tutor mostly teaches her Mandarin through play, since its much too early for formal lessons.  Before the tutor started coming in we used baby videos to help expose her and engender some sort of familiarity with Mandarin since neither of us speak it. 

My questions:

* Is there any evidence that this actually works?.. That exposing a child to three languages from a very early age will save her having to learn them the hard way later.

* Does exposing a child to three languages from a very early age delay speech?  What's the maximum number of languages you can expose a child to from an early age before it becomes overwhelming?

* Is three sessions per week with the Mandarin tutor enough or should we increase those sessions?

In the past few years a new wave of nationalism has hit Romania, with it's own branch of [protochronist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protochronism) pseudoscience which we call: dacism / dacology.

As you might know, most historians and linguists agree that the Romanian language resulted from the process of cultural latinization that occurred after the conquest of part of modern Romania by the Roman Empire, ~2000 years ago (at that time, it was populated by [Dacians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacians)).

Not content with the idea that our language is the result of colonization, the nationalists have come up with a new story: actually, they say, Latin is derived from Romanian, not the other way around.

How is this possible, you ask? Their train of thought goes like this:

- Modern Romanian is actually the same language as ancient Dacian. With some changes, obviously, but everything we think is Latin about Romanian is actually Dacian.

- Ancient Datin is actually derived from Dacian in the following way: 1) Greece was created by people who originated from around the Black Sea area (Thracians). 2) Rome was created by people who originated from Greece. So ""naturally"" it follows that Dacians =&gt; Thracians =&gt; Greek =&gt; Romans. So when the Romans conquered Dacia, they were really just ""returning home"".

Some arguments they come up with to support this theory are:

- The fact that the monument dedicated to Emperor Trajan's conquest of Dacia, [Trajan's Column](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan's_Column) seems to depict Romans and Dacians talking, without the need of an interpreter.

- The fact that later-period Roman statues seem to feature Dacians in preeminent roles, suggesting a sort of respect one would give to revered ancestors.

- A quote attributed to Trajan during his campaign of conquering Dacia, which shows him saying: *""I am returning to the home of my ancestors""*.

Just this year, this theory has received unexpected support from an ex-Vatican collaborator, [Micheál Ledwith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miche%C3%A1l_Ledwith), who has said the following, during a TV interview:

&gt; ""I think what is not often remembered is that Romanian, or the ancestry of Romanian, is from where the Latin language came, not vice-versa, in other words Romanian is not a Latin language, rather Latin is a Romanian language, so I want to salute those people from Bucegi mountains and around Brașov, Bucharest. You are the ones that gave the great vehicle of western culture (the Latin language) to the world.""

&gt; Source: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luWa_vLgc2o#t=55s

Of course, the dacists jumped all over this and gave it the sensationalist title *""The secrets of the Vatican are starting to come to light!""* - (even though the guy never claimed he got that info from any super-secret Vatican documents).

With serious funding from nationalist circles, they have created a pretty high-budget documentary (high-budget for Romania, that is), called *""Dacians, Unsettling Truths""* which you can find here, if you are interested in following this story:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PBdNU7xAcM

My unability to roll my Rs has so far destroyed my social life and confidence. When I was younger I used to get picked on due to my inability to speak normally. It made me shy and avoid social situations.

Now the thing is, you can actually do surprisingly well simply by avoiding words in which you have to roll you R, but the problem is, my first name has one. And this is a HUGE problem for me. I'm literally unable to say my name the way it's meant to be said, and spelling it without the R just makes me seem like a retard. Not being able introduce myself comfortably has made it extremely hard for me to make any friends at all, or to hang out with people. I constantly avoid any situations in which I'd have to introduce myself to new people.

Over the years I've tried a lot of ways to roll my Rs, unsuccessfully. I've managed to do trilled Rs many times with different methods, but it has never felt comfortable in my mouth.  But I do still strongly believe that I'd be able to do it comfortably, if I just practiced it the correct way. I don't consider changing my name an option, besides, alveolar trill is important part of many other languages as well.

I'm 17 years old, I don't want to be left forever alone because of this. In reality I'm not a shy person at all, I feel like I could easily talk to anyone and make friends if I just could speak normally and introduce myself to people. Please help me roll my Rs correctly and comfortably. The quality of my life seriously depends on this.

It seems to me that conlangs come in two broad categories: languages created for use in fiction (Tolkien's languages, Dothraki, Klingon, etc) and languages that are created to to ""fix"" some perceived flaw with natural languages, such eliminating polysemy, making logic explicit, having perfectly regular verb conjugation, simplifying syntax and grammar, etc.

My question is: are any of these things actually ""problems"" with a natural language? It seems like this question is often just assumed and not actually addressed. I feel that much of art, music and humor are based on playing in these ""fuzzy"" areas of language. I would think a language that eliminates much of these fringe aspects of communication would be slightly dull.

This idea has been turning over in my head lately, so I figured I'd open it up here for discussion.

Does language need fixing? Are the irregularities in most natural languages actually a problem? Can a language be ""fixed"" to a point where things like poetry and humor hard to preform?

Special mention for *lei* plural of *leu* (our currency):

Romania's currency is called *Leu* (lion), from *taler-leu*, a semantic loan of Dutch *löwenthaler*. But it's unclear whether the word itself was inherited from Latin *leo* or later entered Romanian as a literary borrowing. It's worth mentioning that lions use to live in most of the Balkan peninsula, as far north as Bulgaria, just south of the Danube.

But shades of meaning are lost in that case.  I think it comes down to the ""essence"" versus ""state"" copula and the fact that this distinction is not made in the English verb ""to be.""  The structure of the phrase ""I am awesome"" suggests the ""essence"" version of the copula--I am always awesome, awesome is an unchanging facet of my being.  In the quote above, however, it's meant to be a transition from one state to another: I cease to be sad, and begin being awesome instead.

I could see a more grammatical version that maintains that distinction as:

***ANSWERS***

1. Related. English silver &lt; Proto-Germanic *silubra, Basque zilar. Both considered from an unknown European language that was responsible for 'silver' words in Balto-Slavic, Germanic, Iberian, Basque, and Celtiberrian (which competed with the native Celtic word 'arkanto'). A classic Wanderwort. 

2. Not related. Troy &lt; Greek Truisa &lt; *Truisas. Wilusa &lt; *Wilus. Earliest Hittite records refer to Wilusa being a city in the land of Truisa, a state. Both names likely come from a Proto-Tyrrhenian source but are not etymologically related. Truisa is probably related to the other Tyrrhenian demonym stem *turs- (Etruscan &lt; *e-trus- ; Ertruria &lt; *e-trus-ia ; Tyrsenoi &lt; *turs- ).

3. We are 99% sure they are related. While a small minority of linguists believes Etruscan maθ to be coincidentally similar (such as Proto-Dravidian's unrelated *mattu- ""honey""), it probably comes from Proto-Anatolian *math-u. English mead &lt; Proto-Germanic *medh-u &lt; Proto-Indo-European medhu-. Etruscan maθ ""honeyed wine"" &lt; Proto-Anatolian *math-u &lt; Proto-Indo-European medhu- ""mead."" The classical assumption that maθ came from Greek μέθυ is tempting but must be rejected. The small holdout of linguists that deny any relationship point to the absence of -u in the Etruscan form that should have remained when borrowing *math-u.

4. Not related. English bake &lt; Proto-Indo-European *begh- ""to warm."" Greek Βάκχυλος is from a Pre-Greek language that was not Indo-European (note the non-Indo-European geminate -κχ- and suffix -υλ-) but the name of this ancient language is unknown.

5. Related. English thumb &lt; Proto-Germanic *þūman- “thumb” &lt; Proto-Indo-European *tu-H-m- “to swell,” “to grow stronger.” The concept of swelling was tied to strength and thickness in the earlier eras of the Language. The Sanskrit reflex easily corresponds to the Germanic, and the two can be compared to achieve an Indo-European root without serious problems. 

Bonus. Related. English aegis &lt; Proto-Indo-European *ayg- ""goat."" A rare root noun with a reconstructed pair *ag- ""goat."" The rarity of *a word initials and the *ayg- / *ag- pairing betrays a likely loan source believed to be Proto-Northwest Caucasian. Abkhaz á-žma &lt; Proto-Northwest-Caucasian *ač:wa. One of the extremely few words believed to enter PIE from a Caucasian family and not the other way around.

 - Is it a thing in your country at all?
 - Is it grounded in puristic, nationalistic values and ""preservation of linguistic heritage""?
 - Is there a standard dialect?
 - Is it enforced by law?
 - Is an official institution responsible for maintaining the standard?
 - By what (other) means is this dialect promoted, except for use in literature and media?
 - Is it mandatory to learn the standard dialect in school?
 - If yes, is it taught as the ""proper"" way to speak and write, or is it actually presented as a dialect that just happens to be the social norm in official communication, comparable to orthography?
 - Also, are students shamed by teachers for using their native dialect in class?
 - Is the standard dialect native to anyone at all?
 - How much does it deviate from the most common non-standard dialects?
 - What particular features of it generate the most ""tension"" between the standard and the vernacular?
 - How is this tension, and prescriptivism in general, perceived by the general public?

Likewise, when English-speakers use a generic Chinese word for ""martial arts"" (wushu, gongfu, wuyi, etc), we use it to refer to specifically Chinese martial arts.

Another example from the world of weapons: Weapon collectors use the German word ""Zweihander"" to refer to a very specific type of German two-handed sword. However, the original word in German clearly means ""two-hander"" and can thus be used to describe a wide variety of weapons.

NSFW language.",guavainindia,75,10,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/lcwtb/what_languages_have_or_dont_have_inherently_bad/,"To clarify, in English certain words are bad in context:

eg, Bitch.

* The dog trainer told me that this was her finest bitch. **OK**

* Your friend is such a bitch! **bad**

But some of our words are inherently bad. There is no context in which ""shit"", ""fuck"" or ""cunt"" could be considered polite.

However, other languages don't have inherently bad words.  Tibetan, for example, has curse phrases but not bad words.

For example:

* **kyakpa** sa! (eat shit) is a bad curse phrase

* phugu **kyakpa** tang go.  (The child has to defecate)

gyo gyab can mean ""fuck"" or it can mean ""to have intercourse"" depending on context.  Similarly ""Mother's Corpse"" is a terrible curse, but neither 'mother' nor 'corpse' is a bad word.

What languages have inherently bad words? Which ones don't?  Why?

Why is this, or did Turkish language have a greater influence on Arabic than I have been led to believe?",Shakedown_1979,72,8,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/r241k/the_arabs_were_subjugated_by_the_turks_between/,"During the Early Modern period, the Turkish Ottoman Empire came to dominate the former Arab states in the Middle East and North Africa.  However, contrary the historical trends seen in places like Norman England, it was the ruling language (Turkish) that incorporated loanwords from the subjugated language (Arabic) into its vocabulary.  


I can come up with one guess as to why this is: as rulers of an Islamic state, the Turks certainly placed great value on the Arabic language, the language of Mohammed and of the Koran.  However, I would still expect the Arabic dialects of the world to have accumulated a great sum of Turkish loanwords and expressions over the course of their centuries-long rule by the Turks.  Strangely, though, Arabic seems much more influenced by the subsequent French colonization of the 19th and 20th centuries, incorporating French loanwords for expressions as fundamental as ""thank you"" into their lexicons.  


Granted, I know very little about the Turkish language besides its basic history and its genetic family, and most of my knowledge of Arabic concerns Modern Standard Arabic, a form based on the pre-Ottoman dialect used in the Koran.  However, to my knowledge, no Turkish loanwords seem to exist in the modern Arabic dialects spoken in the Middle East.

This seems to be to be incredibly unlikely to have been misspoken. It was very fluid, and I don't think I would ever accidentally misuse a pronoun like that. That being said, I was very surprised that the word ""we"" in this man's dialect could be used in the accusative. I thought pronouns were believed to be very deeply ingrained in peoples' minds and I've never heard of any examples (though I'm not a linguist) of this happening in language.

Does anyone have any insight? My best guess is that it was used to emphasize the contrast between ""We reckoned it needed an extension, "" and ""but they told we it didn't,"" and that in a sentence without that contrast ""we"" wouldn't be used, eg., ""My mother thought it needed an extension, but they told us it didn't.""

The most upvoted comments seem to range from indifference to outright glee about this fact.  Many seem to think this is because the languages are unable to adapt/evolve (in a broadly darwinian sense) and are thus eliminated accordingly.

Facepalm-worthy comments are along the lines of:  ""oh well Latin/Sanskrit died out too."" (nevermind the 50 or so languages each one developed into)

The best defenses I saw in favor of language revitalization had serious sapir-whorfian overtones.  

Counter-arguments generally posited that the academic/cultural/psychological value of linguistic &amp; cultural diversity was vastly outweighed by the detriments it posed to the economy/politics/ etc.

*****************************

The best arguments I could think of:

*  Sheer amount of data that would be lost.
*  Cultural legacies shouldn't be decided by the entitled majorities, who have used lies and myths about language in general to perpetuate the cycle of linguistic discrimination.
*  Strong correlation (yes I know the difference) of linguistic diversity to biodiversity
*  Each language loss is a permanently missing chunk of information that can be used to aid genetic studies, and reconstructing proto-languages more accurately.

I'm an American currently trying to learn Portuguese and Russian (I know a bit of Spanish). So, in both of those languages, possessives and adjectives change their endings based on the gender of the noun, right? It's usually pretty intuitive- mother is feminine, father is masculine, etc.

I started wondering, since gender separation seems to have been a common trait as words developed, has there ever been (or is there currently) languages that approached this by making women say words with 'feminine' structure, and men with 'masculine'? If not, why did it naturally develop the way it has?

Also, why did masculine and feminine spelling appear at all? Wouldn't it be easier to just have the word 'my', rather than 'meu', minha', etc?

I'm a 17 year old, Swedish boy that recently got interested in linguistics. It started with me just doing some research on my native language and trying to learn about it, only the basics like what distinguishes the language from other languages, the background of the language and so on. After a while I became interested in learning about other languages as well and eventually, I discovered that there was a science of language, linguistics! (Why isn't it a mandatory subject in school? Many of my friends don't even know that it exists and neither did I! T.T) So a few days ago, I found this subreddit and I've been reading a lot these past few days. Unfortunately, I've been having difficulties actually understanding everything as many of the posts are written in linguistic terms that I don't really understand, which has caused me to be trying to google and wiki it all but it just feels like and endless circle. This is usually the process:

I read a post with a word I don't know written, I look up the word on wikipedia or something similar, only to find an article with more words that I don't understand but are necessary to understand the first word. These words' articles, in turn, have more of those words and in the end I normally end up finding an article with the word that I didn't know in the first place! Very confusing and discouraging, to say the least!

So, figuring that all of you must have learnt all of this somehow, even though I'm realizing that many of you have an education in the field, I'm asking you, what is the most efficient way to learn all of this? Are there basic words that are the most common to describe the more intermediate words that are used to describe the advanced ones or anything similar? Where can I find and learn those?

I would be very thankful for any help!",,False,self,t5_2qhos,False,,,True,t3_pwfp6,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/pwfp6/how_do_i_get_into_linguistics/,

Some background:

English is my second language, but my parents began speaking that to me before I turned two. My first language is Chinese. I began reading (English) when I was three and a half and I was reading simple chapter books by Kindergarten, but I never said words in my head.

I'm sure that I never learned to subvocalize as I read because I remember thinking to myself how strange it was that people mouthed words while the read silently and that it was weird that others couldn't read and talk at the same time. I also remember a conversation with a friend of mine in late elementary in which she mentioned a name that I didn't recognize. It turned out that it was the name of a character from a book that we had both read, but that I never pronounced in my head. I guess I just associated the arrangement of letters with the character. I still do this now. I read at approximately 560 WPM with comprehension when I'm reading for leisure. I tend to subvocalize though when reading dense material or learning from a textbook.

A while back I thought the reason I might not subvocalize was because I had learned to read Chinese characters where, essentially, a symbol that cannot be pronounced phonetically stands for a word or a phrase and that maybe I had transfered that over to English in the way that I would just see a word on paper as an idea rather than an actual word. But then I thought about it more as I was typing this and I'm pretty sure I hadn't learned to read Chinese before I turned two.

Does anybody have any ideas on why I learned to read this way? How unique is my situation?

I personally have one summer's worth of fieldwork under my belt, though I'm still nowhere near a competent enough linguist to actually pull off a successful IAMA. I know a lot of the people on r/linguistics are, though (competent linguists with plenty of field experience, that is), and so I guess this here is my formal request to one or more of those people to come share to what I'm sure would be an interested, respectful, and grateful audience any past or current fieldwork experiences they may have and be comfortable sharing, any advice or tips picked up on over the years that they'd like to pass along, or whatever. 

An IAMA from the field would be great, though for that matter so would one from a tiny grad student office somewhere (besides, the office would probably in most cases be the more convenient option, at least from an internet accessibility standpoint). Of course it would be understandable if for privacy reasons one might be reluctant to disclose the name of the language he/she is working on (which come to think of it might be the main reason I've never seen a field linguist IAMA in the past), but while I wouldn't discourage anyone that felt that way from still giving it a shot if they were otherwise so inclined, I do think everybody being on the same page in regards to geographical region, language family, number of speakers, etc., would really help get the conversation going and as such have a huge positive impact on not only how the post ultimately turned out, but also on helping to better the chances of this becoming somewhat of a regular thing. 

Basically, I'm thinking something like Bowern's book, only interactive, reddit-style.

Lastly, as a sidenote/plan B, for anyone that may be willing to give this a shot from the field, if all parties involved were completely clear on and comfortable with the idea I think it could potentially make for a really interesting conversation if we could get a speaker of some endangered language on here as well; while my first fieldwork season was pretty incredible top-to-bottom, without a doubt the parts I found to be the most rewarding, the parts I remember most, came during the off-the-clock hours while just sitting and talking to my consultants and the family I was living with.

Questions of these types are fine if they didn't occur every other post here, since there are plenty of people who are curious about the subject who have no background at all; indeed, I myself only have a limited background (a few undergraduate college courses). 

But with *so* many of these types of questions appearing every single day, it's not really fun to follow this subreddit any more. 

I expect a lot better out of this subreddit than posts like ""why would a language want to change its alphabet script?"" or ""why are there so many languages?"". We'd agree than no one should go onto /r/physics and ask ""why does F=ma?""; that's a question for /r/askscience, and it would kinda ruin /r/physics for everyone following it if that were a kind of post that was common on /r/physics.

He's natively bilingual, as his family is from here in Arizona and he has spent much of his time in California working on the fields. My dad has peculiar traits to his Spanish, and I want to know how they came about.

I scoured the internets, and a lot of the things he says seem to be New Mexican, but I have no family who has ever lived there. Here are some of the qualities of his Spanish:

* My dad switches second person praeterite sounds, i.e. -iste becomes -ites. For example, he'll say something like ""apa/mijo, aónde fuites?"" to mean ""my son, where did you go?""
* Instead of saying ""así"" he'll say asina, e.g. ""ándale asina"" to mean ""there you go"".
* ""J"" and ""h"" sound an awful lot like ""f"" in word-initial contexts. For the longest time, I thought my uncle's name was ""Fuan"" instead of ""Juan"", and a word like ""hierro"" is always ""fierro"" for us.
* When my dad is talking to his friend (I only have this one friend as a basis, because I don't see him with other work buddies), he and his friend say ""ca na"" a lot, and it sounds very much like a particle, used similarly to ""かなあ"" in Japanese I think. I'd like to know about this.

If you can provide insight, I'd be most grateful My only understanding, that it sounds like New Mexican Spanish, comes from ""Studies in New Mexican Spanish"" by Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa as published in 1909.

Think this might be a insight into how language shapes your mindset.",ilovegofry,61,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/yotax/thought_it_was_interesting_that_i_grew_up/,"I always found it interesting, and my linguistics major partner liked discussing it with me so I thought I'd share it on here. My first tongue was Polish, but as I grew up in an English speaking country and my parents struggled to assimilate to the point where my father only spoke English at home, my Polish greatly deteriorated and now I can't speak it fluently, but I understand absolutely everything (as a side question, why is this the case that I can understand it all but can't speak it?). 

For example, ""Ja mam nadzieję"" means ""I have hope"", but as a child, I always thought this meant ""I have my doubts/reservations"" and that it was more a sarcastic utterance. I can see how it could be seen as sarcastic, but here in Poland no one really uses it the way my parents did, and that it really just means ""I have hope"". This spikes my interest, because as much as I love them, my parents are very cold and pessimistic. 

Other examples are the word ""miasto"", which means ""city/town"". I live in an area where to get to the big city, you have to cross a huge bridge to get there. So until I got to Poland, I had always thought ""miasto"" meant ""bridge"", and I struggle to get the image of a bridge out of my mind! It's only an assumption that this is where I got the meaning from. 

""Bogata"" is what you call a rich person here in Poland, but I always thought that it was something you called an old lady or woman (perhaps this stemmed from my parents talking about rich retirees?)

I have always loved reading up on the etymology of language and my partner has a great interest in language cognition and the philosophy of language. I've studied it a little in university, and we both believe that it is language that creates your reality. Would really love to hear your thoughts and views on this last point. Sorry for rambling until this point haha.

PS Merleau-Ponty and Wittgenstein are cool guys.

PPS Another thing I found interesting was that I innately associate words and objects with genders, in English as well, and I've always found it easy to conceptualise the gender of anything around me (whether it be a letter or a place) whereas my partner who only speaks English, finds this a very foreign concept.

Hello there every one.

I was reading about slavery in Spanish colonies and the difference between ""negros bozales"" (slaves born in Africa) and ""negros ladinos"" (civilised slaves). My question is that how come in societies that were overwhelmingly dominated by slavery (like Cuba and North-Eastern Brazil), Spanish and Portuguese became the language of the slaves instead of a creole. Surely with huge numbers of slaves arriving speaking various different languages, the situation wasn't very different from that in Haiti?

Looking for theoretical accounts, no layman speculation please.",,67,11,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/x5670/why_is_sr_a_prohibited_onset_in_english_looking/,"I'm writing a paper on syllable theory and syllabic parsing. I'm also writing a program that parses properly and also recognizes illegal consonant combinations in English. Many of these are ruled out by sonority sequencing and minimal sonority distance, but some have place and manner restrictions based on feature-geometric analyses and markedness principles. For example, two non-continuant consonants are illegal in onsets, and /tl dl/ are also illegal in English, which has something to do with coronals being incompatible with laterals. The phonemes /s/ and /ʃ/, however, seem to defy sonority sequencing and are allowable in clusters that appear in direct violation. I'm leaning towards an analysis that renders these consonants invisible to core syllabification and thus outside the realm of sonority altogether. However, there is an idiosyncratic restrction in English of /sr/ forming a valid onset, although I can't figure out why. /sl/ is a very similar sequence and it's legal, as is /ʃr/. The sources I've come across vaguely say something about a ""place restriction"" on the /sr/ cluster for English, but they don't really go beyond that. Does anyone know of a concrete theoretical analysis explaining exactly why /sr/ is not allowed to begin an English syllable, while /sl ʃl ʃr/ are perfectly legal?

edit: Thank you all for the responses. You've been really helpful. Many of you have said you have no problem with it beginning a syllable, in theory. Nonsense-words and loan-words notwithstanding, it just seems like an unattested onset sequence in English, although not odd to pronounce on the face of it. Maybe I won't work a constraint for this into my theory and allow it as a legal parse in my program (which is supposed to project syllabification rules onto nonsense words anyway), since it throws off my analysis somewhat and I don't want to resort to an ad hoc rule since I've blasted so many researchers for ad hoc analysis in my paper as well :P.

If a non-English speaker was shown a sample of English names (having not seen any before), then given a separate list of words which they had to classify as 'likely to be a name' or 'unlikely to be a name', could they do so with any accuracy?

If they are able to classify the list accurately (by correctly identifying the real names, and discarding the red herrings) then does this suggest there are recurring patterns that are unique to people's names which are not used when we name other things?

there was a linguistics subreddit...d'oh!

So I was watching this TED talk by Patricia Ryan called
""Don't insist on English!""

http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/patricia_ryan_ideas_in_all_languages_not_just_english.html

Her point was that the rush towards English as a global language
was leaving many smart people in the dust.  Great point, and I 
really recommend this video, it's only 10 minutes long.

At about 7:30, she's talking about a study...fuck it, I'm just going to quote her directly.  

""Two English scientists were doing an experiment to do with genetics,
and the forelimbs and hindlimbs of animals but they couldn't get the results they wanted, they really didn't know what to do, until along
came a German scientist, who realized they were using 2 words
for forelimb and hindlimb, whereas genetics and does not differentiate,
and neither does German.  So, bingo, problem solved.  If you can't think a thought, you are stuck.  But if another language can think
a thought, you can learn and achieve so much more.""

At this point, my jaw hit the floor.  

First off, if you're talking about limbs, English does have a word for 'limb' that does not distinguish between forelimbs and hindlimbs...appendage.  

Second, and infinitely more important, this is basically the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, right?  Which, I thought, everyone nowadays agreed was bullshit.  

I like to think of myself as a smart, open-minded guy.  But I simply cannot accept that having a particular language can in any way PREVENT a person from thinking a particular thought.  

Have I gone completely astray here?

Well I've been working at it for about three weeks now, and here's some thoughts.

1.  If you're ever lost at night in a small village anywhere remote, you can find your direction by checking the direction of the satellite dish on the nearest building.  If you're on the BC coast it'll be pointing South by South-East.

2. Yes, there are places where it can rain hard for a week straight.  Day and night.

3. Having no internet is good for getting work done in the evenings.  Having no phone is just a pain though.

Basically, we've been recording a couple hours each day.  I take some time getting ready for recording, and usually spend three or so hours transcribing each day (usually get through about a half hour of recording, though it's getting faster).
I'm actually learning the language!  I can understand the majority of what I'm told now, and can recognize all the word boundaries, etc.  It's wonderful!

Also, I just started training someone to keep on doing recording and transcribing once I'm gone, and am having the joys of teaching all the grammar of the language one-on-one to a person with a quick mind and a strong desire to learn.

The lady we're working with has a good sense of humour, an amazing knowledge of history, and is having an easier and easier time remembering as time goes by.  Also - she's been pushing us to work longer as well, till the last couple days she didn't want to stop recording till after three hours, which in my opinion is quite an accomplishment given how mentally challenging this type of work is.

I also had the privilege of meeting a Nuxalk man who not only learnt his language to complete fluency over the past five years (starting in late teens), he also learned entire oral history, traditions, all names, place names and history of entire traditional territory, etc.  I have now been inspired to pursue learning my own language (which I speak as a second language) to a higher degree of fluency.

Ask me anything within reason about the language or the work.  It's been a pretty intense few weeks so I can probably answer any questions you have about the language.

EDIT: About the language.  Sguuxs is a Tsimshian language.  It has roughly three related languages, one of which is mutually intelligible, and all three of which are in the same region - the north coast of British Columbia just south of Alaska, and one village in Alaska.  It is an ergative absolutive language, with a wide range of ways to form plurals, both of nouns and of verbs.  A noun's position in the sentence is shown in part by its position (VSO or VS, or perhaps I should say VEA, or VA), but also based on what are called connectives.  For example a word preceeding a proper noun will have a t or an s attached to it based on its position.

Another cool attribute is that in transitive sentences the verb is plural or singular in agreement with the object.  Even though that's what would be expected in an ergative language, I still find it cool.

The language also has phrase suffixes, if I can call them that (there's a proper term for them but it escapes my memory atm), and also other suffixes that can be put on the end of every word of a clause, and wreak havoc as they double up on everything else.  I haven't heard many examples of this yet, and as the lady I'm talking to doesn't have much patience for trying to ask the same thing over and over again, and also remembers everything that has been asked her for the last ten years, I'm mostly just recording as much vocab as possible and trying to get examples along the way in the form of sample sentences.",,False,self,t5_2qhos,True,,,True,t3_fkeq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/fkeq0/update_leaving_in_the_morning_to_learn_sgüüxs/,

The most simple example is that of Spanish-- I address a male friend as amigo, and a female friend as amiga. In a high school Spanish course, that is certainly sufficient with which to begin.

My question is how this relates to modern ideas of gender, which have expanded in many ways outside of the traditional male/female split of the sexes. How would a language with these sex-specific (as they seem to me) structures deal with a person who has transitioned from MtF, or FtM?

People today seem to like using it to describe someone's appearance or style (""check out my swag,"" ""this guy is the definition of swag,"" et cetera), which may be derived from ""swagger.""  I recently talked to an older man (60+) with a military background, and he said it stood for ""Silly Wild-Ass Guess.""

The rabbit hole begins:

* Another redditor [asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rvsdp/what_the_fuck_does_swag_mean/) about swag a couple days ago, and got at least three different answers.
* The term can be dated at least as far back as 1838, in *Oliver Twist*: '""It's all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?"" asked the Jew. Sikes nodded.'
* [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/swag) claims to have seen it used as early as 1660, but without citation.
* Google [defines](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=define%3Aswag) it as ""an ornamental festoon of flowers, fruit, and greenery,"" which is not a definition I've seen corroborated anywhere else.
* Australians have their own slightly ambiguous definition, which should come as no surprise.

As you can see, my amateur research has turned up plenty of interesting tidbits, but no answers.  It's time to pose the question here: What does swag mean, and where did all its definitions come from?  Linguists and Australians weigh in, please!

Basically, /s/ and /z/ become /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ before /j/, even across morphological and word boundaries. So ""this year"" /ðɪs jiɹ/ becomes ""thish year"" [ðɪʃ jiɹ]. The same process affects /z/, as in ""is your..."" /ɪz jəɹ/ becoming ""izh your"" [ɪʒ jəɹ] This can even take hold across other consonants, like ""last year"" /læst jiɹ/ becoming [læʃt jiɹ] or even [læʃ tʃiɹ]

I saw the word 'wise' listed as a synonym for 'method' and thought it was pretty odd since they didn't list the type of 'method' synonyms I would have expected.

The example they gave was 'in no wise', which until now I always thought was a corruption of 'in no way.' It seems to actually be from the Middle English word 'nowise.'

I guess my derp moment came when I realized it is directly related to the much more common word 'otherwise.' It turns out 'anywise' is also a word. We also use these prefixes with the word 'how' to make 'nohow' and 'anyhow' (but not otherhow).

I noticed the fact that it was written in the present tense kept me aware that it was a joke with an eventual punchline coming up. Eventually, however, the joke switches to the past simple tense. I don't know if this was done intentionally to make the reader forget he's reading a joke, or if the author simply switched automatically when the joke became more like a short story than a joke.

I know narrative jokes are told in the present tense in English, Spanish, French and Italian, but it's not a very representative sample. Could present-tense joke telling be a _meme_ that has spread specifically among Western European culture? Is it specific to Indoeuropean languages? Or do other more distant languages also use the present for jokes and the preterite for stories? If so, I think it might be an interesting feature of human nature.

I'm afraid I have no training in linguistics, so I apologize if this is somehow a silly question, if I'm overreaching by assuming all languages separate ""jokes"" from ""stories"", or even if I'm erroneously assuming the past tense is a global standard for storytelling.

I was just considering what the odds of some of our chatspeak that is currently used almost exclusively online actually entering the English language and changing our vocabulary or grammar.  With the high exposure of today's youth to online media (the average 8-18 year old is plugged into the internet or their mobile device 7.5 hours a day [source](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/education/20wired.html)), one has to anticipate some changes to the English language.

What kind of changes would you expect to see to English in the future thanks to the ""internet culture"" that we're surrounded by?  These are a few ideas I had:

* The use of ""lol"" within or at the end of a sentence to indicate lack of seriousness.  It's already done in written online language (does anyone ever really literally mean ""laughing out loud"" these days?)  *i.e.""Yeah my professor really must love us, assigning a thesis the day before Cinco de Mayo lol""*
* The inclusion of ""nom"" as an eating verb and adjective.  *i.e. ""I was noming my sandwich"" or ""The cake was nom""*
* The occasional replacement of ""o"" with 0 in certain contexts, such as in insults *i.e. ""y0ure a n00b""*
* ""Hai"" becoming an acceptable spelling of the greeting ""hello"" or ""hi""
