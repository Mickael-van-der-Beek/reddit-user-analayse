Boo hoo. Take away my imaginary internet points. I don't care. 

I subscribed to this sub not long ago thinking it would be interesting to see how actual corporate shills are trying to infiltrate reddit and game the system for their own nefarious marketing purposes. I expected some interesting posts/discussions with the evidence to back them up. (e.g. accounts exposed as being directly linked to a marketing firm, that sort of thing).

Instead, all I have seen is witch hunt after witch hunt. An endless parade of smug, self-satisfied posts calling people out as shills based on little more than a corporate logo that happens to appear in the picture they submitted. And god forbid any newbies to reddit try to share a cute picture of their kitten crawling in a Pringles can, HailCorporate will be all over your ass in a minute - with zero evidence mind you - to out you has the coprorate shill you are!

Want to post your pictures of your trip to Disneyland? Nope, sorry. That's not welcome here. Got a cool new ride you want to share with everyone? Better duct tape over the logo on the front grill. Oh wait, is duct tape a brand name? Oh my! I must be a corporate shill! Grab your pitchforks and torches everyone!

You see, when this sub is filled with nothing but unsubstantiated accusations and witch hunts, it has zero effectiviness at all. None. It becomes so much smug white noise on my front page and I don't really enjoy it. 

In short - this subreddit is a joke and a waste of my time and the time of anyone who comes here looking for actual sleuthing. But by all means, carry on with your witch hunts!

I realize the sidebar says posts about AMAs are discouraged, but I figure it's worth explaining to people that AMAs are not the personal contact with celebs you think they are.

The [ID Public Relations](http://id-pr.com) firm is one of the largest and most powerful in Hollywood with lots of celebrity clients. One of their employees, named [in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1egkr9/i_am_gillian_anderson_ama/ca00q20) by Gillian Anderson's account, is trying to keep PR firms from becoming obsolete in the digital age by doing a bunch of big name Reddit AMAs.

How do I know this? Elijah Wood's, Ethan Hawke's, and Gillian Anderson's AMAs all share two weird writing quirks and they're all verified ID PR clients. The writing quirks are:

-Typing names of titles in all caps (e.g. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES instead of *The Dark Knight Rises)

-Using one dash instead of two dashes in the middle of a sentence (e.g. ""I told him - and he's been my friend for many years - that in no way..."")

Links and evidence:
Examples:

-[Gillian Anderson](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1egkr9/i_am_gillian_anderson_ama/). An [example]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1egkr9/i_am_gillian_anderson_ama/ca00vxz) of the dash thing.

-[Ethan Hawke](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fq1h6/i_am_ethan_hawke_amaa/) - look at the OP, plus many of the comments. [Example of the single dash]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fq1h6/i_am_ethan_hawke_amaa/caco0wr)

-[Stephen King](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqzn2/i_am_stephen_king_novelist_executive_producer_on/)

-[Elijah Wood](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqrz2/i_am_elijah_wood_ama/), in the OP and his comments. Also interesting to note: one could argue that they're just doing the quirky capitalization thing because they don't know reddit's formatting to italicize, but [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqrz2/i_am_elijah_wood_ama/camuveo) proves it's not that. Also, an example of the [dash thing]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqrz2/i_am_elijah_wood_ama/camusoy).

**Clients at ID PR**

-Proof that [Elijah Wood](http://fyeahdeanogorman.tumblr.com/post/36889274400/idpr-at-the-hobbit-in-new-zealand-with-id) is a client.

-Proof that [Gillian Anderson](https://plus.google.com/114424902652073724598/posts/gRsn9ezckD3) is a client.

-Proof that [Ethan Hawke]( http://ethanhawkeinformation.blogspot.com/2008/05/ethan-hawke-is-having-baby-with-nanny.html) is a client.

**Other Suspected AMAs**

-[Stephen King's](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gqzn2/i_am_stephen_king_novelist_executive_producer_on/) AMA has the two writing quirks, but I have no proof he's an ID PR client.

-Same with [Mitch Hurwitz's](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gj9mt/i_am_mitch_hurwitz_creator_of_arrested/)

Given how personal a lot of the AMAs were, especially Ethan Hawke, I'm guessing that Victoria is just the woman setting these up and typing the responses.

&gt;I am part of an advertising company. My team has manufactured numerous front page posts over the past 2 years. Already, we are prepping for the Dark Knight Rises campaign. This consists of ""story boarding"" ideas for funny pictures, like maybe a silly situation that happens at a movie theater where the DKR marquee is conveniently in the frame, or a submission that starts with ""Look who I found when I went to see the DKR this weekend!"". We are also allowed to screen the film early to pick out plot points that would be ripe for a ""Scumbag Batman"" or ""Scumbag Bane"" type meme, so we can plop those up immediately following the films release.

&gt;In order to do this, we need to maintain plenty of ""average"" accounts. This means having an account that's been active for 6+ months, posting semi-regularly, gaining karma steadily, so it's not rejected by the community when ""they"" submit their advertising. Sometimes I think this contributes to the banality of this website.
Your website is already being ""exploited"", but can you call it that? It seems like the community loves these types of submissions, even if they're manufactured.

[Another Conan Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i9hnm/conan_explains_the_obvious/) hit the front page yesterday and has 2037 upvotes with only 160 comments.

so within two days two Conan posts have made the front page with minimal comments.

[heres one from 4 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i1sjs/conan_is_excellent/) 2772 upvotes but comments are at 700 here. 

Those are just recent ones, I cannot seem to find the others in the search tool that are older as they did not have the word Conan in the title.

A commenter has told me that these images all look similar as they are posted by the Conan social media team and are then being posted and reposted here. 

I am not alone in this as another redditor by the name of /u/AltRedditAcc replied to my comment saying  

&gt;""I've seen countless of other submissions reaching frontpage with ~2k upvotes and near no comments, only to see comments flooding in as soon as I saw the submission myself.
Definitly bought upvotes. There's no way thousand people upvote without commenting and then suddenly everyone stops lurking.
I'm actually surprised noone brings that up ever... until now.""

As I finish typing this post the first post by /u/romz7 is now at 2600 in this very short time. 

I am afraid I might need more concrete proof but this issue should be brought to reddits attention. /r/adviceanimals did not tolerate quickmeme gaming them and /r/funny should not tolerate Conan's either.


 

**UPDATE:17th July**

Hello everyone. Thanks for all all the views and comments, I am back with some new information.

* Firstly a few Conan fans are saying it doesn't matter because he is funny. I am british so I am unbiased in my opinion of him as I do not watch his show, from what I can see he is very popular and genuinely funny. BUT that shouldn't allow him or his PR team to game reddit to get hundreds of thousands of views by cheating your way to the front page.

* From what I can tell the posts are not being by bots but rather regular redditors. This means that the posters are not associated to the PR team and usually have no idea about it. A possible scenario could be that bots scan and find these Conan joke images and give them a shot of upvotes to increase their visibility and have other normal redditors do the rest. These bots probably bugged out which is why you sometimes see mass upvotes or downvotes on random posts/comments.

* /u/romz7 replied telling us what happened regarding his post. 
&gt;I have no idea about the bots voting or anything but yes it was the first time any of my posts got up voted in such a short period of time. I was at about 100 up votes in the first hour and then by two and half hours I was almost on the front page. After that, it had a lot of down votes.Even my comments were down voted for no reason.

* Redditor /u/Wylye claims this sort of thing is happening on other sites too. Heres his quote.
&gt;I've seen it happening on other sites as well. Fark.com always seems to have at least active TeamCoco branded link in their video tab per week, despite all the comments being negative. It was pretty much all but admitted they were buying the space.

* Another redditor claims that Ellen posts are also being botted, I am not sure about this as I did no ""research"" on it. The same PR company that handles Conan could also be working with Ellen but that is just currently speculation.

* I was told to present my evidence in /r/KarmaCourt 

Finally, I am not asking to ban all Conan links but to actually raise awareness on this whole botting/gaming issue. As it can have a negative impact on the site.

In 2011 YouTube was getting played by various gaming commentators who ran game giveaways in exchange for likes and favs. This caused the site's homepage to be plagued by terrible videos as the influx of likes/faves pushed it to the front page for a week, a $10 investment for a PSN/MS points card meant massive exposure in which the uploaders gained thousands of new subs and millions of views.

This can be easily stopped. YouTube stopped the botting, /r/politics mod was removed spamming to his blog, /r/gaming did not tolerate Microsoft botting on there 2 months ago and /r/AdviceAnimals banned Quickmeme altogether.

1359313984.0,404,self.HailCorporate,17dpnu,Reddit's entire function is to serve as a data mining and web traffic advertising tool. Hear me out.. ,SA1L,471,67,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/17dpnu/reddits_entire_function_is_to_serve_as_a_data/,"Reddit is owned by a $7 Billion private media company. Why? Out of the kindness of their hearts they wanted to provide us with an online forum for cats and bacon?

I despise advertising but am also intrigued by the psychology of it at the same time. The Reddit model is ingenious because it creates very specialized pools of target markets, driven by like-minded consumers and fake 'karma'. People have a tendency to want to identify with groups, so when they see top posts in /r/recipes using a certain brand they subconsciously believe that other kitchen gurus use this trusted brand. Likewise, although pizza/soda is incredibly bad for you, when a subscriber sees Pizza Hut and Mountain Dew in /r/gaming it helps move the consumer to see past the negative effects as 'it's part of gaming culture' and I subscribe to that. 

In large, I believe most of the advertising we see here on Reddit is PR; highly effective, inexpensive way to shape public perceptions. It reminds me of FRONTLINE PBS's documentary [The Merchants of Cool](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/) I'd really like to see FRONTLINE do an updated version of this documentary to include social media. 

It's been great to see this subreddit grow so quickly, glad so many others are aware of this problem. Honestly, I don't think it will ever go away. 

What bothers me, is that there are clearly some improprieties with regards to Reddit's algorithms to move this advertising content. New users showing up with 1000's of karma and no posting history... Content moving thousands of votes within the first hour...  I've asked Mods about this before and their response has always been that Reddit is 'open sourced' so you can see the algos yourself but I don't buy it and they're probably not aware themselves. 

Reddit could never be owned by a publicly traded company because it would expose their revenue streams, ultimately destroying Reddit's entire culture. 

EDIT: Had to include the karma as a driver

Don't attack the messenger, alter the message",digitalchris,478,86,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1hy6vb/idea_go_countercorporate_dont_attack_the/,"So, I was looking at [the Pretzel bun debacle](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1hwhqp/i_know_this_isnt_instagram_but_god_damn_wendys/) and the general love/hate relationship that reddit has with HailCorporate. In general, it's not a good idea to witch-hunt posters (even if they may be corporate shills... because you'll always catch some innocent posts in the dragnet) and we are not a downvote brigade right?  

So what CAN reddit do in light of the ""any press is good press"" marketers in the post-Oreo-superbowl world?

Here is one idea: counter-posting. Photoshopping. Evolving the Streisand effect to include attempted corporate messages, without attacking the messenger.

HOW?  Much like the popular [FIXED] posts that pop up all over reddit, we don't cry ""SHILL!""... we counter-shill.  

Example: take the suspiciously good-looking [pretzel bun](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1hwhqp/i_know_this_isnt_instagram_but_god_damn_wendys/) image and photoshop some maggots in it. Post it with a story about you were REALLY hungry for some Wendy's&amp;trade Brand Food... UNTIL THE HORROR!

Alternatively, photoshop out the ""Wendys""-laden straw and cover that straw with the McDonalds (or whatever) logo. In my fantasy, some marketing firm would send a cease and desist for using their image....

The great benefit of doing this is that it doesn't harm the original poster, if they are just a redditor posting something interesting. ""ha! look how famous my photo is; people have turned it into 20 disgusting posts!"" ... UNLESS they care about the corporate brand, in which case their eyes might melt out  of their heads.

Here's a list of my findings, the lines that are **bold** seem to have been correct acccusations; *Italics* denote when it's hard to prove either way and normal text when this subreddit wasn't correct or it's difficult to prove either way.

I should mention that I used account activity and status to determine the markings, as such if a company marketing employee used his own reddit account to post the ad he would be marked as a regular user in this list.

I'd still like to research those that I've marked with italics. What I'd especially want to do is to find legitimate accounts that aren't very active and compare them against the less active accounts that are suspected shills. Also things like verified e-mail adresses and such among shills and non-shills would be interesting, not to mention what type of subreddits accounts are active in.

I think we should do more digging into these accusations, right now this subreddit behaves more like an angry mob wanting to burn the witch than a place where discussion &amp; investigation towards corporations hiding advertisement on reddit.

And that's fine.

But I noticed there's been a lot more Gold being ""donated"" recently. It's become a ""thing"" for mysterious strangers to lavish Gold on top comment users (""Edit: Wow, thanks for the Reddit gold!"")

So I'm guessing it's a deliberate effort from the Reddit administration to gift gold to people with top comments in high-traffic threads in order to make this gift giving a ""thing"". And if the number of accounts that have it is any indication it's working quite well. Pretty smart move if a bit disingenuous, what do you think?

Also, what I touched on before.../r/hailcorporate is not just calling out paid advertisers.

And before you say something like, ""we can't support any corporations???@!""  No.  I didn't fucking say that.  There's a big difference between supporting your local business, or a relatively low key corporation than fucking jerking off the CEO at DoritosTM.  You know the difference, don't be a moron.

1373153492.0,233,self.HailCorporate,1hrvwa,Why HailCorporate is failing in it mission and becoming a variation on /r/conspiracy and how to fix it.,adamwho,399,166,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1hrvwa/why_hailcorporate_is_failing_in_it_mission_and/,"I have some direct experience in this area because I have both been accused of ""shilling"" and have actually used reddit for marketing in the past when I was at a small startup.  Here is why HailCorporant fails to accomplish what it aims to do.

1.  HailCorporate by its very nature can only focus on larger companies, this is simply because larger companies are a known brand and can attract more attention.  It is already difficult to separate out advocacy for a product/company with an unrelated anecdote; that is not every mention of a business in a post is product placement ad.  This issue is multiplied when the business is small and the naming of the business is seldom considered ""shilling"".  
 
2.  Larger companies have no motivation to advertise covertly on places like reddit.  Large companies have established products, marketing departments and advertising channels.  When they do advertise in social media, they do it big like the [Old Spice]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE) commercials a few years ago, which redditors were more than happy to embrace and [create endless memes to promote the product](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/isaiah-mustafa-old-spice)

3.  Because of the first two, Reddit misses the people who actually use places like reddit to promote their products which are small startups and activists.  For instance I have used reddit to promote products and test the market when I worked at a small startup.  The company focused its attention on subreddits that were relevant to the product and used the tactic of starting thread to promote a conversation about the product and point to a website or blog for more information.  This is also the tactics that activists use on reddit.

4.  Hailcorporate has a political blind-spot, which causes it to misplace its attention.  For instance, generally places like reddit and specifically hailcorporate have a strong left-leaning bias.  What this means in practice is that political ideology often determines what is acceptable or not.  It would be obvious to most redditors that a right-leaning website would naturally have blind-spots with respect to religion, climate change, creationist, gay marriage, and ""birther"" conspiracies, the same is true for left leaning websites.  Author and skeptic [Michael Shermer noted in Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-liberals-war-on-science), that the left also has its anti-rational bias'.   

5.  Finally, if you want to just be a variation on /r/conspiracy, that is fine but if this is the case then there is nothing to do.

What this means in practice is that advocacy for left-leaning causes are given a pass, while other causes are either seen ""shilling"".  

How to fix the problem:

*  The focus should be who posts threads, not comments.  A person who is paid doesn't actually get any benefit from arguing with people on the internet.  The tactic of people who are paid is to get as many links out there to drive people to a venue where *they control the message*. This is basic marketing and you should know this if you wish to ferret out advertising on reddit.

*  Separating out business advocacy vs science advocacy/debunking.   Nobody is paid to debunk pseudoscience on the internet, there simple is nobody to pay them.   

*  Recognize that debunking false claims isn't advocacy.  For example, saying ""that claim about product X is false and here is the evidence"" is fundamentally different from ""Product X is really great"".   

*  Focus on evidence instead of emotional appeals.  Nobody really cares if people are using social media to advertise because it comes with the territory.  The real issues is: are the claims true. 

***

A good rule of thumb:  ""You should be most skeptical of those claims you like because you are sufficiently skeptical of those you don't.


***

Edit 1:  It looks like hurt feelings are dominating the downvote buttons in the comments, which is expected.  The focus on emotional appeals and politics over reason is one of the problems with this subreddit.

Edit 2:  As someone noted.  Why is the issue PAID advocacy?  Shouldn't the focus be on the validity of claims?  Teachers are paid to promote facts and evidence, if those facts go against your religious or political beliefs does that make them ""shills for X""?   

It is the same with contentions issues on reddit.  You have activists who make false claims and you have people debunking them, why is it the people debunking the claims get called shills when the activists who posts 1000s of thread not?

I was called crazy, I should delete my account, that I am slandering, calling them names and accusing them of things and will be reported. Swiftly, my account was shadowbanned.

Now one user claims to be a scientist, writing in the name of science. I won't say his name, as it will conjure him up here and I will be accused of sladering him. The other is named after the founder of Monsanto and claims to be a farmer.

Considering they post around the clock, I don't know how they have time for scientific research or farming at all.

The people that makes those posts are morons, or paid shills, hangers-on of the paid shills, or some combination of those things.

I agree that many of the increasingly frequent ads on Reddit's front page are probably not by advertising companies.  

However, that doesn't matter.  An advertisement on the front page of reddit is a reflection of the corporate hijacking of our culture.

A user dedicating their attention, time and effort to creating a shrine to some shitty consumer product, or popularizing that effort, reflects either paid work or a disgusting lack of creativity, both of which should be called out.

This subreddit has been under attack lately. A few blatant ads have fallen flat in the past, largely due to this subreddit's influence, and I think this may have spurred some backlash- paid for (professional) and free.

Critics are often popular because they appear to be battling the ""status quo,"" so criticism of a subreddit often picks up steam- especially when that subreddit's purpose is noble and makes people uncomfortable.

In this subreddit there have been quite a few of the tired ""This subreddit sucks I'm unsubbing because you people have no PROOF that these ads are being made by advertisers!"" posts.
This is a great example of a damage control tactic to discredit your detractors.  They've accused this subreddit of being guilty of something that it never claimed to be.    

Even in the sidebar of this subreddit it states:
&gt;""This...reddit is in large part about documenting the fact that reddit really is used for viral and native marketing. Yet also to highlight the fact that regular people are doing the work of advertisers.""

There is no need for any kind of proof that an Advertisement has been paid for! An advertisement is an advertisement, no matter what a person's motive was for posting it, whether or not it was a [""great concept""](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1dqp9g/robinsons_fruit_drink_ad_hits_front_page_of/c9syig2), Calling out a front page post as an advertisement is the purpose of this subreddit.

The comments in [this recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1dqp9g/robinsons_fruit_drink_ad_hits_front_page_of/) in particular made me sick.  It appears that the detractors have reached criticial mass.  The dimwitted, oppressive majority has arrived.

As for being a ""downvote brigade"" I'm all for it. Get that product-worship bullshit off my front page! Why shouldn't we be downvoting advertisements which take up our time and attention?

I propose that the moderators in this sub start battling the effort to undermine this subreddit. Delete the comments which marginalize or detract from the post. Delete the whining ""I'm unsubbing! someone pay attention to me!"" posts.  Tell people, as moderators, that a post is still valid even if there is no ""proof"" of the motivation behind the advertisement's origins, or whether the advertisement is any ""good"" or not.  

Also, ban the terms ""pitchforks"" and ""witch hunt"". They are great terms the astroturfers here have been using to make us look bad.
""What? You didn't like that ad! It had a great concept! Put away your pitchforks! This is just a witch hunt subredditt!!!!11!""

Since when was this subreddit only allowed to criticize poorly done, well-documented advertisements? 

Edit: Many people have taken issue with my ""downvote brigade"" comment, which I wish now I hadn't included -so that people would have to focus on what I am more interested in, which is better moderation.  All I meant by it was that you shouldn't resist downvoting an advertisement because there is some nebulous rule about mass downvoting (and people love threatening that our subreddit will get ""shut down"" for going on ""witch hunts""- these people really are good at spreading fear aren't they?). 

If reddit wants to discourage organized downvoting then they will have to shut down the meta subreddits, or remove the down arrow, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad change site-wide, but that's another topic.  

Comment AND downvote, that's all I meant to say.  Commenting alone just brings more eyes to the advertisement, which means more ad exposure.  Don't go through the user's history and downvote all of their comments, just be redditors and downvote crummy ad posts.  If reddit admins start scolding us for that then I'm finding another website.

If people are resistant to the ban of words and post deletion, then moderators have to really step up and start labeling these posts and commenting -  ""advertiser damage control"" ""inaccuracies"" etc. etc. to battle the outright lies and ""divide and conquer"" strategies from the subreddit's detractors.",,False,,t5_2t1sc,1367881191.0,,,True,t3_1ds95w,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1ds95w/this_subreddit_is_great_but_is_in_need_of_some/,

I know this subreddit has grown hugely but also taken a lot of crap due to so-called ""witch-hunts"".  Seems to me we're doing the right thing, but we also need a way out (a middle path) because companies aren't going to stop using reddit.

**I think the most annoying part of ads is that they masquerade as legit content.** On reddit when you talk to OP, you're hoping to talk to a real person, not an advertising team.

**So the problem isn't that companies are here, it's that they pretend to be us.**

**Solution?  Companies pay for ads.**  They go in the ad space.  Minions, Go Pro videos, Cheerio commercials, put them up in the ad space.  

If companies are clever, they'll still get votes and discussion, and we can all live in peace.  And in exchange for making bank of whatever they advertise, the companies, pay something to reddit to help support the site.  Then its more out in the open, less insidious, and actually means they're helping rather than hurting the community.

I think this might give us something to propose as a solution rather than just trying to chase these no-good-nicks outta town.  I think instead of saying ""get the fuck off reddit,"" we should say ""be decent people and pay for advertising because you have the money and you're taking advantage of our community.""

EDIT:   After thinking about it more **I think we need a tagging system in /r/pics and /r/videos** (for a start).  There are rules for posting, and one of them should be ""If you're an advertiser, please pay for your advertisement and submit it to the existing ad space.""

Then, there should be an option to report a submission as an ad.  If it meets the criteria, it will be tagged as ""possible advertisement.""  I don't even think we need to remove it, but **if we regular folk need to play by the rules, then ad agencies should too, and that includes paying for ad space.**",,False,,t5_2t1sc,1376057038.0,,,True,t3_1k0mbi,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1k0mbi/i_think_that_ads_on_reddit_would_be_less_annoying/,

Every single time someone made an order like that my manager would leave the window in disgust (I'm assuming because of the names). We WILL make your sandwich however you want it! There is a price for adding ANYTHING on the menu to a burger!

......
&gt;I introduced the McGangbang to my kids and they love it, order it every time we eat at McDonalds (which is seldom, pretty much just when we're on a road trip). I did clean up the name a bit, we call it the McBarnyard. Extra points if you add the fillings of the $1 sausage McMuffin into it, with the egg under the chicken patty of course. You you have bread, beef, pork(?) sausage, cheese, bread, chicken, bread, beef, cheese, bread. The kids usually omit a couple slices of bread.

**tl;dr; harassing people you think are marketers is not ok**

------------------------------------------------

**Boring Pedantic Introduction**

When I was a kid my grandfather brought me some textbooks he had found in his building's lending library. One of them was about marketing, and I read the first few pages of it before I got bored and found something stupider to do, like split grandpa's [red tam tam stool](http://i.imgur.com/AMIHBuH.jpg) in half and try to spin one side like a top. Despite my fickle attention span I still managed to learn something interesting, which is the definition of marketing:

&gt;[**Marketing** is the process of communicating the value of a product or service to customers... From a societal point of view, marketing is the link between a society’s material requirements and its economic patterns of response.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing)

(The cynical among you might point out that that's just how marketers choose to market marketing. Humor me.)

Marketing is about getting information to people about things they don't yet know could help them. We're all marketers, in the sense that we all are part of this process. I just marketed the red tam tam stool to you, I bet you didn't even know those existed. I don't work for Stoolcorp United or anything, but nevertheless it could well be that there's someone out there for which it just clicked that a red tam tam stool would perfectly fill the void they have between their recliner and television. That's marketing.

Another example: sex-ed is marketing for condoms. Teenagers don't know why they need condoms, sex-ed explains STDs and pregnancies and how easy it is to put a rubber on a banana, and, hopefully, kids come to understand why condoms are like totally cool man.
We need marketing, in the sense that without eachother's help we do not become aware of products that can really help us Most marketing we don't even notice, and are ok with, both on reddit and off reddit.

**Hate. Hate.**

Then why do we [hate marketers?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDW_Hj2K0wo) Is it just if they're getting paid for it? We don't hate the editors of [Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/) or [Cigar Aficionado,](http://www.cigaraficionado.com/) even if so much of what they do essentially serves the purpose of marketing: helping us become aware of and know more about new things that might make our lives better.

Really, we hate marketers paid by the sellers of the product they are marketing. Those dirty advertisers.

Why?

Advertisers have little incentive to give accurate information. They don't care whether we actually need shit, just whether they can convince us to buy it. The snuggie is just a backwards robe. I seriously doubt that the snuggie tapped a previously unknown market of people for whom bathrobes and blankets were just not enough. But they sold five million units, seriously, how the fuck? Because they bought a ton of ad space at a time when it was cheap to do so. [And that's probably the least harmful example I could come up with.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvcj8mpC4M1r48zyio1_400.jpg) They create needs to fit products rather than vice-versa.

Normally you'd think, if I hear about something that happened from two different friends, odds are there's something that made it worth talking about. But with advertising, you just gotta pump in more dosh and you get [the Rosetta Stone effect](http://www.caseycheshire.com/the-rosetta-stone-effect/) Advertising makes everything harder to trust, even non-advertisers. Especially on reddit, where my two friends could have just sold their accounts to an advertiser and there'd be no way to know.

They have a much bigger voice than you or me. On TV this is a given. It didn't used to be true on the internet but now it obviously is. And on reddit this used to be ridiculous, but now it seems in question. You and I, we're trying to have a conversation- the advertisers are grabbing the mic and telling their story.

And they're getting a free ride. I won't be sending a bill to RPS or CA for their previous mentions, even though this post will probably send more clicks to them than a google ad on the same page would. It's like the creamos at a restaurant, the take a penny give a penny jar at a corner store, you don't just grab a handful. That's what advertisers are doing when try to use ""social media"" or ""seo"" or ""word of mouth"". They're saying, instead of whatever you would normally talk about at lunch, you could make us money if you were talking about our product. Instead of what you'd normally see on the front page, we'd make money if you saw an [Oreo ad.](http://www.shopify.com/blog/7589919-the-secret-behind-oreos-social-media-marketing) So we'll put one there. And you'll like it. And it'll be cheaper than buying one of those stupid ads on the sidebar that nobody looks at.

These are [not](http://betabeat.com/2013/02/hail-corporate-the-increasingly-insufferable-fakery-of-brands-on-reddit/) [unreasonable](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-hire-spam-ian-miles-cheong-sollnvictus/) [concerns.](http://www.slideshare.net/viralseeding/viral-seeding-creds-2011)

**Not so bad?**

But sometimes we are unreasonable about them. If you google ""reddit marketing"", you'll find that most guides to marketing to us are pretty reasonable.
Check it out:

[""create engagement through content creation... provide something of obvious and proven value to the community you are marketing to on reddit... the only marketing that the content should do is give credit to the creator of the content.""](http://www.blueglass.com/blog/how-to-market-on-reddit/)

[""Be a redditor first, marketer second.""](http://www.thornybleeder.com/index_files/how_to_market_your_music_on_reddit.html)

[""Gnip pulling public posts from Instagram, Reddit for dark marketing magic""](http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/04/gnip-new-social-apis/) Wait, ew.

[""Have respect, be a person, don't force it, provide value""](http://tristanbarnum.com/pitfalls-of-marketing-on-reddit/)

All in all, not terrible stuff. They're not all liars and jackals. They're still taking payola to pretend to be people while pushing their product, but at least it's with... respect? But then, these are also the small fry. What we have been seeing lately is not infographics or 10 greatest x listblog spam like plagued digg, but just weird, honestly just very weird amounts of praise for corporations from a website that used to have to world's hugest hate-on for them. Maybe these are not the marketers we're looking for.

**No conclusions, only dreams now.**

[What have we learned from this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQQdSwFgSec)

Everyone's a marketer. [Some marketers are more evil than others.](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/02/is-marketing-evil.html) Some people aren't getting paid for it, which makes them not evil, and also makes it kind of shitty if you harass them after their house has just burned down. If you want to spread the word about being skeptical of advertising and marketing on reddit, super, but don't be jerks.",,False,,t5_2t1sc,False,,,True,t3_1cabtn,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1cabtn/mod_post_my_two_cents/,moderator
1365289601.0,155,self.HailCorporate,1btllo,This sub has gotten out of hand [petition to moderators for some reform],spevak,265,110,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1btllo/this_sub_has_gotten_out_of_hand_petition_to/,"If you agree that this subreddit needs a change, please upvote this post for visibility (it is a self post so I get no karma)


So at this point I think a lot of you will agree with me that the content on this subreddit has become very low quality.  Almost every single post's comments contain some argument over whether the post should be here, and often times there is more complaining about the post than actual discussion about the post.  I'm making this post as a place for us to consolidate our thoughts about the post quality here, and discuss possible solutions.


In my opinion, the problem is that the majority of posts are just ordinary Reddit content that happens to contain some minor mention of a brand name.  Sure, part of this sub is about ordinary people doing the work of advertisers, but there is a huge difference between a post meant solely to glorify a product, and a picture where there happens to be a logo visible somewhere that isn't even the focus of the post.  For me, the part of the sidebar description that most accurately and concisely sums up what I expect from this subreddit is the very last bit:
&gt;rampant consumerism as companies harness the persuasive power of social media

In particular, we're here to see how consumerism is effecting our online experience.  If my friend tells me he's going to the store to buy some coke, I don't throw a hissy fit about how ""he's doing the work of advertisers.""  But any time someone casually mentions a brand on Reddit, people think it's such  a big deal.  If you would take it in step in real life, I don't think it belongs here.  I'm not *disagreeing* with the claim that these things are cases of consumerism, but they're completely unremarkable.  Yes, we live in a consumerist society.  Yes, we know, people drop brand names all the time in casual conversation.  But that's not the point of this subreddit. I'm here to see how ""compaines harness the persuasive power of social media.""  It's no surprise that people are going to use brand names on the internet just like they do in real life; what's worth documenting here is how the internet is opening up NEW ways of advertising.  What belongs here is when marketers abuse the viral nature of Reddit content to promote a product, or when ordinary people do the work of advertisers by posting something that *primarily* focuses on a brand.


Another thing that doesn't belong here is comical posts.  If a brand is mentioned satirically or as part of a joke, that's not consumerism.  In fact it's kind of the opposite; if people are making fun of a brand, that doesn't help advertisers, it hurts them.  I've seen several posts here that were clearly cases of companies being made fun of.  Comical posts don't belong here. 


Ok, now that I've explained what I think is going wrong with this sub, I'll propose what I think could solve it.  If you have alternative solutions, please propose them in the comments.  As for me, I think the best solution would be an approved submitter list.  To get on the list, you would have to have your first post approved by a moderator.  Furthermore, people should be able to flag posts they don't think belong here, and if an approved submitter has too many bad posts, they'll be removed from the list.  This will essentially prevent people from coming here on a whim and contributing to the logo-spotting circlejerk.  The sub will still be visible to everyone, which is good, but only people who understand what this sub is about and are committed to maintaining a high quality of content will be able to post.  


Lastly, I know this suggestion comes with additional work for the moderators, and I understand if they don't want to do the work of maintaining a list.  But I really think something has to be done, and if things remain the way they are I won't be here for much longer.  I think a lot of people here share this sentiment.

Looking at the [user's post/comment history](http://www.reddit.com/user/faaastcash), it looks like a lot of the comments are very generic and ""reddit friendly"" in that they mention popular memes but don't really say much. I'd go as far as to say many of the comments just seem... strange. I can't really put my finger on why. 

The user seems to be pushing a payday loan company (I'm not following that link it posted though...) and even just payday loans in general, there are a lot of self-posts where strange or even obvious financial advice is given without much context. I believe these, and the comments he makes on popular subreddits, are made to seem like the user is just a regular guy who likes giving financial advice.

Reddit needs to be honest about this.**

Bear with me here, English is not my first language and this is a bit of a wall of text. 

Created a throwaway for this cause I don't want this mixed in on my regular account. I use that for my daily Redditing. Reddit is my main source of entertainment on the internet and I love it. I come here for fun and to learn things like the day-to-day use of the English language. So I rarely visit subreddits about things that are likely to annoy me like news, politics and finance. Same goes for subs that are meant as activism againts other parts of Reddit. Except for /r/HailCorporate. Reddit not being honest about advertising really annoys me, and I don't come here to get annoyed. So I just need to say this. 

You've probably noticed these brands that have been advertising on Reddit A LOT in the past few months:

Doritos &lt; Frito-Lay &lt; **PepsiCo**

Tostitos &lt; Frito-Lay &lt; **PepsiCo**

Mountain Dew &lt; Pepsi-Cola &lt; **PepsiCo**

Pizza Hut &lt; **Yum! Brands**

Taco Bell &lt; **Yum! Brands**

Yum! Brands is a spin-off company from PepsiCo. It is an independed company now, but I wouldn't be surprised if they used the same ad agency for their internet marketing. Yum! Brands sells PepsiCo beverages in most of their restaurants, so PepsiCo benefits a lot from Yum! Brands sales.

I don't think all of these posts are separate ads. Some of them are, but the ones I use as an example above are part of one big ad campaign. **Media companies like to sell ad campaigns that last several weeks or months rather than sell one time ads.** 

Ever wonder why Reddit, a media company that needs to make a lot of money to survive and stay relevant on the internet, barely has banner ads? **Yeah, Reddit is one of those media companies that sells ad campaigns.**

**Reddit sells businesses frontpage posts that are guaranteed to get thousands, perhaps millions of views in a few hours.** These posts are not only upvoted by users. Reddit makes sure they hit frontpage and stay there. Businesses like this service cause they need a way to reach people with ads that don't directly look like ads. Ads that are supposed to go viral and the internet is perfect for this. Reddit is perfect for this. That's how Reddit makes money.

And I ain't even mad. I have worked in media for a few years. I've sold ad space that people came across while reading magazines and by seeing billboards. **Ads are annoying, but they're just how business works.** The thing is, **Reddit should be honest about these posts being paid advertisements.** Put a (advertisement) label on those posts like they do in newspapers and magazines and on some websites.

**A lot of people in this sub have been asking what the goal of /r/HailCorporate is.** I think that should be it. To get Reddit to be honest about posts clearly being paid advertisements. So we know Reddit needs them to pay the bills and to exist. And we know we just have to accept them for that. 

Or if they are *not* ads, and Reddit is *not* making money off of these posts, they should have them deleted for being spam. So when we come here, we can enjoy Reddits great content that is put there by its users, and *not* see brand names everywhere.",,False,,t5_2t1sc,False,,,True,t3_16cmuj,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/16cmuj/pepsico_yum_brands_and_reddits_frontpage/,

For example, a user might submit a picture of his ""battlestation"" and on his desk are an array of Apple products. It is entirely possible that the user just happens to like Apple products, and keeps them on his desk when not using them. A user might submit a picture of themselves curled up on the couch with coffee watching  Saturday morning cartoons or something, and the coffee might just happen to be Starbucks.

Much of the time it is easy to see when a user is an astroturfer by the details of their account and their posting history. Often in advertisement posts brands will be very clearly and prominently displayed; they will be large and conspicuous, perhaps more color saturated than normal. These are obvious clues. However sometimes it is not so obvious. We live in a society that for better or worse is completely flooded with branded products. Our lives are consumption-based, and brands are painted on everything around us.

I personally believe that we are heading toward a time when there will be no visible distinction between astroturfing and sincere content because we are so immersed in a brand-oriented life. Everything will be branded eventually, and it will become natural to defend ""your"" brands against others.

Yes, there is no doubt that companies advertise here, Yum! are the worst offenders i think, but too often it seems like people are trying to be ""first"" here and don't really look into it and think about what they are doing. We all just sounds like a bunch of conspiracy nuts most of the time. We should be applying the same amount of scrutiny on our own thoughts and posts as we do other people's posts to ensure quality here. 

For example, a redditor who has a long history of posting things about skating and skate movies is probably a skater, the fact they post something about a soft drink is not unlikely because hey, that's what skaters are into! They skate, the stink, and they drink shit (nothing against skaters or anything). Yesterday was the super bowl, an event known for new/funny/entertaining commercials that ALWAYS gets talked about in many forms of media and it's reasonable that the second most watched sporting event in the world is going to be talked about, marketers or not. I know i'm not the first person to create a post like this, but I think it's warranted. Maybe this subreddit just isn't for me.

Both pics are hosted on livememe.com, are the same meme, were posted at the same time, and are from accounts with relatively low karma scores. (OP in the first link has literally one submission: his or her current post.)

I've been seeing a shit-ton of livememe posts all of a sudden--which, given my hailcorp suspicion, I found weird. Then, a few days ago, I read some front page [YSK post](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1axxqy/ysk_about_quickmeme/) linking to a comment that urged users against using quickmeme.com, a post that also championed livememe.com as an alternative website. The [linked tirade comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1avdq9/its_time_to_bring_sexually_oblivious_rhino_back/c91jot1?context=3) cited a lot of speciously verified evidence against quickmeme (e.g. as one commentator pointed out, the guy used a Yahoo Answers screenshot as proof), and even attacked the personal lives of quickmeme's creators. As you can see, both the tirade comment as well as the original adviceanimals post itself (hosted on livememe.com) was deleted.

Fortunately, there was a user [in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1axxqy/ysk_about_quickmeme/c91ur3f?context=1) of the YSK post itself who quoted (and analyzed) most of what the user said in the [deleted] comment.

Neither company is innocently advertising, of course. Quickmeme has become so synonymous with adviceanimals that I don't think anyone has even mentioned it here as advertising. But it looks like we have an attempted wide-scale takeover and smear campaign on our hands, friends, from livememe. Mwuahahahaha!

I’m a media communications associate for a small Columbus- based business. We’ve never interacted with reddit before but we're considering it now; specifically to reply to people that talk about us or are interested in what we do (in the subreddits that relate to our industry).

I already posed a question like this on 'ASKREDDIT' but then thought I'd get more passionate and knowledgeable responses here.
I reddit outside of work so know how things generally work but I've never really thought about companies on reddit.

""Is there ever an appropriate way for businesses to honestly get involved with reddit"" i.e. not astroturfing

Does anyone know of any other companies already doing this (outside of all the obvious astro-turfers?

Can businesses contribute to the subreddit communities?

Lots of people in that thread are reminiscing about the awesome toys they received from the Commonwealth Bank as children.

That Dollarmites campaign has been running for years, but fortunately for us, images are on hand of all of the previous incarnations of dollarmites, just in case we have forgotten.

The user /u/wonderbra6 has only posted one time, and their only post made it to the front page. They linked to a story on neurope.eu. I decided to check out /u/wonderbra5 and turns out they also have only submitted one link 2 days ago [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1cgey7/google_fined_in_tokyo_over_autocomplete/) and sure enough it was a link to neurope.eu. Now there is also a wonderbra3 and 4 that have not made a submission yet, but I am willing to bet in the next day or two they will be submitting a link from neurope.com. The wonderbra accounts were all made at the same time 2 days ago.  Also even more damning, check out /u/wonderbra2 they only have commented on threads where a neurope.eu link was posted. And OPs of those posts were even more spammers that follow the same pattern as the users listed below. 

I did a search for links submitted with neurope.eu as the URL and came up with plenty of results http://www.reddit.com/domain/neurope.eu/ Now the interesting thing is how many of those links were submitted by brand new users with no previous posting history, and no posts since the one they made linking to neurope. Here are some examples of users who only posted neurope links:

http://www.reddit.com/user/YoWix

http://www.reddit.com/user/Ninja_Jam

http://www.reddit.com/user/josh71

http://www.reddit.com/user/MarioDim

http://www.reddit.com/user/snian

http://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaBravo_

http://www.reddit.com/user/JarHeadDude

http://www.reddit.com/user/JackZipLi

http://www.reddit.com/user/EuroDingo

And those are just out of the first 15 results on the search by domain. There are 5+ spam brand new account submissions to every regular poster linking to neurope. I am sure if you keep going down you will see more of the same. New accounts with only one post link to neurope, some of them with random names like snian,yowix,ciciazqm and so on. In RES you can hold your mouse over the usernames on the domain search results page and see how many of them linking to neurope had never posted before or again after submitting that one link. 

So is it neurope trying to get hits, is it a marketing team or hired spammer, or is it possible all these people just registered one time to link to them and never post again? Once again I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit, but as we can see today every so often one of their submitters with a brand new account makes the front page and drives to them tons of traffic.

For a longer read on the same subject see the recent [mod post bu joke-away](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1cabtn/mod_post_my_two_cents/) or read this:



&gt;There are a few things we need to go over. 

#####[](//.) We get a lot of confusion over people who don't read the sidebar or who think we are about something different than we are. We are about showing posts that act as ads.####

   The world around us is filled with advertisements: radio, tv, publications, digital media, billboards, et cetera. The internet is no exception and it is well known that ads already have present on the internet. The president of the USA interacted with this website, so you have to know is not unknown. When you get something to the front page of reddit that can get hundreds of thousands of views or more, why would someone who is trying to market something not want to utilize this for their benefit?

   There are many types of advertising that happen at all times, thing like: *[Native marketing](https://www.google.com/search?q=native+marketing&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS504US504&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=native+marketing&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3j62l2.2012&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), [Viral marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing), [Guerrilla marketing ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_marketing), and many other concepts and ideas to build brand awareness. Whether you like it or not, just seeing things is enough for them to be processed by your brain, and as you see things repeatedly you become more aware of that thing.  

  Long ago reddit really was different, people can argue all day about what the differences are or what is better but the point is there really was a time, before RES, before Imgur, before the Digg exodus, when reddit was more about science and technology and less about pictures. Since then, as the user base grew reddit has come to be manipulated by and attempted to be manipulated by many people, yet  reddit.com has still held quite strong had still strives to keep a vigilant watch and to not let the spammers take foot. But the fact is that ads do get through, no matter how you interpret them as there are many examples of people successfully working the reddit system to get their content on the front page. And in the origin of this subreddit I just wanted to document it, to show others that reddit wasn't fool proof. Nowadays we have a though decision on what to do with the subreddit and what the point is, but until we come up with something better we will continue with the same path. 

 **For these reasons things that mention, show, include, or talk about companies, corporations, products, logos, merchandise, entertainment shows/movies, or anything that can be sold are all valid reasons to say that a post is acting as an ad.**  It does not matter the account age nor the karma score, for a number of reasons. **This does not mean that everyone who posts something that mentions anything that is sellable is an astroturfing corporate paid shill who farms karma and manipulates their IP address.** In fact it is a sad reality that this corporate culture is so ingrained into our society that many people post things that act as ad with no idea they are doing so; so pelase don't get out your pitchforks or be rude to others ^(We don't want to have to ban anyone but we will if it comes to it).

STOP!

Not all content featuring ads is posted by shills!

Advertisers should prefer ""Upvoting"" (on reddit at least) natural posts which feature their products.  
So, John Doe posts a picture of his Cat with his head stuck in a branded Chip-Packaging-Tube and it front-pages... 
Left alone, the post may not escape /new, but the Chip-Company's contracted advertising firm sees/detects the posts and directs 200 upvotes towards it. It escapes /new and is on the fast track to the front page. 

--The user thinks his post is doing great, never knowing or being involved with the advertisers--

Then we show up and Call him a ass-eating-shill and, as a community, drive people away from the cause.

So just remember, 
* Not every OP is a shill. 
* Advertisers are tricky sons-of-bitches.
* Stop making the r/hailcorporate community look bad via name calling and focus on educating people about the prevalence of ads in everyday life rather than calling out suspected shills without good evidence.


My 2 cents. 
Thank you!

** Obviously there ARE shills out there, but many-many posts are innocent posts. Tread carefully and be constructive instead of demeaning. We don't want to be considered a community of crazy ass-holes.

For example this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1b3obw/one_of_the_most_awesome_ideas_ever_hello_europe/

Okay, I'm not saying this currently has any link to any corporation, this is not a conspiracy theory. I just want everyone to pay attention to this.

These people are not asking for the people's money. These people are not asking for funding through governments of the countries in question. They reject the idea of crowdfunding. They don't respond to questions why they don't use crowdfunding. (They even simply remove such suggestions wherever they can.)

These people are explicitly asking for a private sponsor. They are explicitly asking for corporate support.


Why not use crowdsourcing? Well, posts on their facebook page suggested that and similar things but got removed without response or explanation. 

I want to make this absolutely clear: They reject public funding of their project while at the same time trying to raise awareness and support among the population. They ask for a corporate sponsor to finance their project who will definitely be rewarded by *at least* having his name on that screen. And it will be legitimized by people being indoctrinated into loving that idea and then the corporate sponsor will get a huge PR boost for being so generous and amazing for investing into such a social project by that small independent group of people.

I just want this post to be seen in this subreddit so that I can eventually tell everyone ""I fucking told you so"" when these things 'accidentally' happen to turn into screens playing adverts for their chosen corporate sponsor. 


tl;dr: I predict this is gonna be a giant ad screen playing ads in public in major cities with the ""corporate sponsor"" not having to pay advertising costs because they erected this public ""social"" monument for intercultural communication.

This is what I posted:

&gt;I have a slight suspicion that there are a lot of Microsoft employees posting here.
I had Google winning 4 times, and one draw. And while the results maybe different for others, I can't shake off the suspicion that Bing just wouldn't win this much...

&gt;**EDIT:** Look at the people who say Bing is better and look at the stuff these people have been posting in other sub-reddits: The two under me /u/HammeredPizza and /u/rabidb are always posting in things to do with windows phone and windows.
I have done some further research: /u/McBeers has been posting all over reddit about the fact that bing is better than google.
And now the Microsoft employees will downvote me to oblivion.

Mods said they will remove it - still waiting on that, but give them time!

I'd invite you to keep one thing in mind from now on...

You're on the internet.  Part of the brilliance of a site like reddit is that it has reached an critical mass of tens of millions of daily active users.  There are going to be lots of idiots who, yes, did create an account to show everyone their chicken nugget shaped like a velociraptor.  

There will also be people who created an account who did nothing with it but defend some company/product three times in a week and then quit.  That's pretty normal behavior.  One of the main things that prompts people to create an account is when, for whatever reason, they get pissed about something and want to promote some worldview.  Also, accounts like that are common because you can have as many accounts as you want.  Because you don't have to use a real name on reddit, people will make an account (which takes less than 30 seconds) when they don't want to use their main one to take an unpopular or odd position.

We all love reddit and want to make it a walled garden where people can be free to exchange grand ideas and cat gifs without being treated like consumers.

Actually, that's not true. Some of us want to see reddit get adequately compensated for all the obvious ads they are hosting as posts and comments by corporations and their shills. Every time I see /r/HailCorporate in a thread I think, damn, reddit should be getting paid for this. Corporations treat reddit like a giant, free billboard. It shouldn't be free. Reddit should be getting paid.

Although their blog post doesn't specifically mention it, it seems like reddit is not being adequately compensated. The intensity of corporate messaging is incredible, and growing. That shit is valuable. Reddit should be making bank of all this. Millions of dollars a month.

I, for one, am going to take a different approach to my anti-corporate agenda on reddit. I'm going to start referring obvious marketing posts to the people (all listed in the blog post) who *should* be making money off them. I believe this is the best way to (a) help make reddit profitable, and (b) get someone whose job it is to police reddit to actually give a fuck about all the corporate messaging.

Feel free to join me, or not. If someone has a good idea for a form letter that says something better than 'hey fuckwit reddit employee! Is Company X paying you for this shit?' please share.

If you would read my comment from the other day [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/16d17u/another_taco_bell_ad/c7v5nyw), it would make this easier.

I think its part of the sickness that we all care about that the very mention of the name of a product induces its effect.  You and I can't talk specifics without using the exact magical word 'they' spend so long to craft full of special meaning.  This I believe is the nature of the culture of hailcorporate, our inability to discuss our world without being an advertisement ourselves.

What I know and mean is that the other day I read the words 'Taco Bell' and though oh hey I have money and they are pretty close and I want to be lazy and...

My suggestion is that we remove the capitol letters from the products we discuss here.  Such a thing seems to have less psychological power.  What do you see as being more attention grabbing?  'Reddit' or 'reddit' ?  Capitalization is a form of respect granting and its in your and my best interest to remove respect from these products that flood the rest of our culture and lives.

Ninja edit*: Also another thought I just had that isn't related to the topic.  That is, well, I mean hell and fuck me; All of the posts on hailcorporate could be rival companies ad campaigns bemoaning the broadcast of rival products.  I'm sure someone else has said such a thing in the time this has been a subreddit; and if not then I would be surprised.

Attached to the third top comment was [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1idodh/kanye_wests_new_shirt_is_a_120_plain_white_tshirt/cb3klow) by /u/IHatePicklez, a user for 11 hours, which reads:

&gt;Hopefully the knockoffs only /r/cost/[1] like $70-$80 each like a normal shirt. I mean, these are nice, but not worth over $110.00

Upon visiting /r/cost I noticed it was laced with Amazon Affiliate links to all sorts of junk, and the sidebar mentioned it included Amazon affiliate links. I then took a look at /u/IHatePicklez [comment history](http://www.reddit.com/user/IHatePicklez) and found myself diving into an infestation of affiliate-link laden subreddits, some declaring openly in the sidebar what they were doing, while others not doing so. Diving into one moderator's or commenter's comment history lead me down a rabbit hole of even more subreddits that they had name-dropped. This process repeated ad nauseum. Here is a table, documenting each Amazon Affiliate Subreddit, its age, and its moderators and their ages along with some other info.

Most of these moderators, along with other users posting/referencing these subreddits, are sure to mix in typical imgur material with their amazon postings, even if the amazon stuff floats to /top. From what I can tell, this is a relatively new strategy, as some of the older subreddits at the bottom of the table don't appear to have any imgur content. As well, the moderators (and other commenters that reference these subs) will often have comments that blend in with the conversation, while dropping a random /r/subredditlink such as one of those above. A big part of the problem to me is that **even if the mods are hellbanned** --I'm assuming that's why some of those mod's user pages are 404'ing-- the subreddit itself **is still there** and constantly getting name-dropped by other spammy users, ensuring that the affiliate links **still get plenty of hits**.

Judging by the relative ages of some of these subreddits and users, I take it I'm late to the party noticing all of this, but it's irritating as hell in any case. Makes me want to write a bot that scans for this sort of stuff and run statistical analysis over the users, mods, subreddits, and comment/link characteristics and apply some heuristics to come up with a dynamic blacklist for this garbage. I really don't care if the subreddit mentions the Amazon Affiliate program in the sidebar or not. As far as I'm concerned, this sort of thing deserves a blanket ban-hammer.

And I wasn't even finished tumbling down the rabbit hole. Got tired of adding row by row to that table after about an hour.

This format is effective because it makes users feel Reddit-saavy and ""in on the joke"" for seeing the original submission.

When you see submissions with obvious product placement, make sure to point it out - comment quickly and often, keep it simple. The old standby, ""Nice try, *brand x*!"" can still work wonders.

Most would say that it is the intention of the redditor, but I must disagree because the links kind of speak for themselves, the author doesn't truly matter after the post is made.  I frequent r/motorcycles and nearly every post is about a corporate product, but how long can anyone living in the ""developed"" world go with out talking about a corporate product?  Our culture is dominated by the corporate machine and obviously reddit is not exempt.

I am beginning to think that a subscription to this subreddit is actually detrimental to escaping corporate's influence on the media I read because it simply brings these advertisements on to my front page.  I think that this subreddit needs to be more oriented towards discussion of the corporate invasion of reddit and less simply pointing it out.

5 of the 15 front page /r/HailCorporate posts are anti-Xbox one.

One of them involves a verified reputation management contractor who was fired after posting about the xbox one on reddit. 

Absolutely none of them are about PS4 shills. In fact, I'll probably be severely downvoted for not praising the PS4. 

Does no one else thought ""Wow, there's this huge backlash against the Xbox One, and suddenly there's all kinds of new accounts being blatant shills for the Xbox One getting called out... which works out eerily well for the PS4...""

I mean, if we can believe that MS is capable of white-washing the internet with some massive PR campaign starting Monday- is it really unreasonable to think maybe PS4 is doing something *right now* to make MS look shitty? Especially that contractor- that's too perfect. Is it impossible that she's paid by Sony, as is her company, and they're lying to make MS look like complete assholes on top of having their console torn apart online?

Looking at their history they likely find some old posts that have done well and repost them.  They collect some amount of 'legitimacy' or  least plausible deniability through that karma.  They likely do this with thousands of accounts automated as much as possible.  Then they use one of those accounts to post some paid content and the other puppets vote up.  That is how they end up with lots of votes with very few comments since comments are harder to fake.  

Sound about right?

I am wondering:  do these voting patterns have a signature compared to organic posts?  Would there be a big upvote spike or an unnaturally steady uptick?  If so, would it at all be practical to script up something that monitors   for those kinds of signatures?

I'd love it if we could get data on who votes up what....then we could probably find the incestuous cells.  As things now stand, it is not possible to get at that kind of data, right?

This seems like it is probably a hit-piece advertisment by a competitor of Breyers trying to hurt their brand.

I base this off: http://www.statista.com/statistics/190426/top-ice-cream-brands-in-the-united-states/ as you can see Breyers is the largest ice cream brand in the US, so it is definitely a target for this type of action.

It makes perfect sense that competitors would do hit-pieces on reddit if they are already doing promotions for their own products it is quite natural to extend that by doing anti-promotions against competitors.  In fact it is probably easier for a hit-piece to work than for regular advertisement to work, and possibly much more effective, and lower risk. I have seen quite a few of these types of hit-piece posts before this one as well.

EDIT: saw this comment: [apparently the main flavors are still ice cream](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/137eg2/til_breyers_has_cheapened_up_on_the_ingredients/c71kc3v) so this is clearly a hit-piece.  Who the fuck would link to some wikipedia article to tell other people that an ice cream brand was bad, except for a marketer?

EDIT 2: The plot thickens.  I checked the [history of the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breyers&amp;action=history).  As you can see there has been a rash of edits in the past couple days, several by someone with an IP address of 64.30.37.102.  One of the edits by this person included deleting the entire History section of the Breyer's article.  Perhaps they felt the quaint history of the company would lend Breyer's some charm and positive PR.  The Wikipedia mods quickly undid that edit.

I looked up the IP address 64.30.37.102  here http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation and what do you know, the location is listed as Vermont.  Which is where the headquarters of Ben and Jerry's is located, and Ben and Jerry's is one of Breyer's main competitors.  this is funny stuff.",,False,,t5_2t1sc,1352955193.0,,,True,t3_138023,http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/138023/reverse_hitpiece_advertisements/,

If I see something that I wouldn't normally remove but it has a large number of reports, I will think long and hard about it and more often than not remove it. 

Reporting content that you feel is exploitative, whether intentional or not, is the best way for us to communicate to the moderators of the different subs that we redditors do not like that type of content. Let them ignore us, but if we are steadfast in the reporting the varying things that are turning Reddit to shit, they won't be able to ignore us forever.

What's particularly terrible in this case are the fake comments of wonder and amazement marveling at this revolutionary technology. They include such eye-stabbingly horrid gems such as:

Edit: apparently part of the marketing slant for this is to advertise it as means to ameliorate groundwater contamination due to fracking. Has it really gone this far? That instead of just stopping fucking fracking (which is insane to begin with) we now have guerilla marketers pushing fake virals to unfrack your drinking water?
