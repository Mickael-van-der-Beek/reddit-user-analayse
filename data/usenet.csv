1355045819.0,780,self.usenet,14jjl6,nzbmatrix is now closed :(,nylithic,870,90,615,http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/14jjl6/nzbmatrix_is_now_closed/,"

The End... 

It is with our regret to announce that NZBMATRIX had closed.

We have had to make this decision due to a very large takedown request from a company called Wiggin LLC. These represent the following: Federation Against Copyright Theft Limited (""FACT""), Paramount Home Entertainment International Limited; Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Limited; The Walt Disney Company Limited; Twentieth Century Fox Film Company Limited; Universal Pictures (UK) Limited; Warner Bros. Entertainment UK Limited. 

As everyone is aware we are DMCA/Takedown notice compliant, and always have been.
Once this notice is completed we are left with an impossible task of policing our indexing bots.  Even then it won't stop there, there will be follow-up notices etc.

Coupled with this is problems with payment providers, we have been through pretty much everyone out there, in the end they all pull out.
There are massive server/bandwidth costs to pay, with the payments in-stability this is a very hard task.

NZBMATRIX has never been the subject of any legal issues or threats.

Also the Usenet Indexing scene is going through some changes, with content being removed from pretty much every provider its making the existence of an indexer irrelevant if the content does not even exists anymore.

So it's time for us to bow out...",,False,,t5_2qucj,False,,,True,t3_14jjl6,http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/14jjl6/nzbmatrix_is_now_closed/,

Give me this one post and I'll leave you in peace ;-). Oh, also, excuse the rambling... I wrote this in a random order and I'm still ill.

Firstly, thanks! The team over at nzbX would like to thank everybody who has supported us since launch, helped us when we needed it; and those who have continued to use the platform.

Now, I know that I can come across as a bit of an asshole, to be honest - so do some of the people in this community, but you know what, why does it even matter? If some people have taken offence at the way I speak and act, then I'm sorry. Part of me wanted to make a joke about how people could go suck a bag of dicks if they didn't want to accept it, but then I thought that people might take it quite literally and go on a murderous rampage to acquire a bag of dicks.

Anyway, where was I - oh, that's right... thanks! When I first launched nzbX in December, I was expecting a few hundred constant users within a couple of months... but it rapidly grew. It grew to the point where I had to get in people to deal with spam, abuse, comments and complaints (and they have done a great job, thank you editor team!) so I could focus on development. It grew to the point where I was putting in 60+ hours a week in order to get the platform to a stage where I was happy with it (it's still not there).

In the beginning, I was a bit of an idiot with infrastructure and due to poor efficiency - ended up blowing close to $8,000 in month one on the clustered architecture. By month 2, despite having far more traffic - I brought it down to $4,000. By month 3, I'd made the platform more efficient in general and if we kept it running on the existing cloud based architecture... costs would be around $3,100 a month with existing traffic figures. I'm pretty happy with that. I recently realized that spending $48,000 a year to keep this thing running (no way in hell were donations going to match that), whilst possible... was not something I really wanted to do. So I spoke with my team, I spoke with people from the community; and somebody brought up the idea of a donation drive. When I linked this idea to my desire to switch to owned hardware (to lower ongoing costs), it seemed great.

Some people think the drive was a good idea, some people think it wasn't - I'm somewhere in the middle myself. When we started the drive, it was decided that I would just outright buy the hardware we needed in advance - and whether or not we met the total, we would have it. We needed to migrate sooner rather than later, and thankfully - we now have the hardware. It's some fairly sexy equipment that I got refurbished, sourced from a company that specializes in liquidating the assets of companies that go bust. To those of you that did donate, I really am thankful. To those of you that didn't because you couldn't, I'm thankful - it's the thought that counts. To those of you that didn't because you just didn't want to, well, I don't see a problem with that.

So, I decided to stop accepting donations. Firstly, I did not want to put the site in a position where it became reliant upon them - given the shaky legal area of indexing (and the way payment processors are aggressively smacking people down - Google and Paypal will outright ban you for life it seems), I decided to go with my original decision; and turn off donations and make the damn thing free and accessible in it's entirety, to everybody who wished to use it. This is one of the few times where I have ignored my team and done what I thought was best. In the long run, I think that's the case - I've put enough funding in to the site now to keep it running for quite some time. I realize that my post on the nzbX front page may have seemed pretty snide - but it was a 4AM flu riddled developer who posted it without thinking about it too much. Apologies to anybody who felt a bit put off by it.

I am constantly working on the platform, though recently it's been more in the ""GOD DAMN USERS WON'T STOP SEARCHING, OPTIMIZE EVERYTHING"" area. I've just pushed a few more changes (look at the bottom of this post) which should improve the overall experience for everybody. nuPlay is currently in the ""ooh, shiny new prototype hardware"" phase, and the software is undergoing some serious testing with a small group of people; hopefully we'll be able to push those changes in to the preview branch in the very near future. I'm also in the midst of finalizing the logistics for a ridiculously cheap ""fresh content"" USP; with a retention of only 30 days - yet high speeds and super sexy downloads for all. I'd hoped to launch this venture in March and it seems that I'll still be able to!

My main goal for nzbX in the next couple of months is to build the damn community up. I have an update for the forum ready to push and I'm going to start incentivizing community activity... hopefully that will work. Given the fraction of a fraction of a percent of users who post comments, and the even smaller amount who post on the forums... this is something I really hope that can we make work. The goal was to build a community ecosystem after all.

In other news, as my parting update to /r/usenet - advanced options now persist between searches and the default stage of the options box is to be open on the results page. You can also search the books and comics category now, and I've just pushed a change to the parsing engine which should improve matching releases coming from the more popular groups. Future updates will be posted on the forums.

I won't ask my team to stop submitting here (as I have said previously, the editor team is autonomous)... but given how rarely they have submitted, I don't think that will be a problem. I will ask them not to post updates, etc. This should make the small amount of people that have complained about nzbX content in this sub-reddit happy. I know can't please everybody, but I can at least try!

Again, thank you to those of you who continue to support us, and continue to use us. Consider this my pledge that the site will remain free and open to all who wish to use it. We will not go invite only, we will not put a pay wall in the way... we'll just continue to make things awesome.

So, things are going to be changing around here. How and why? Well, let's start with the how...

**How**

nzbX as an index will be closing down, and instead - will become an open source software package that lets people easily run their own indexing software, whilst allowing for the option to sync releases, ratings and community metadata with other installations. Neat, right? The index will cease to exist as of 6PM GMT tomorrow, at which point a countdown will appear on the site, when the countdown expires - super shiny sexy software release! As I can't really do anything at the moment, making code tweaks from a machine not designed for it is my plan (when I'm awake).

**Why**


Well, first and foremost - I (Lemon) am recovering from a heart attack (at the ripe old age of 26) which I sustained a few weeks ago. My health complications from last year have made a comeback, and they've done it with a vengeance. I do not have the time or energy to maintain running an index or fight any legal battles which could arise from doing so (as per below).

Today, whilst I was half comatose - I received a visit from a member of FACT (Federation Against Copyright Theft) who attempted to pressure, threaten and harass me (and failed) to hand over control of the domains (presumably so they could use it as a honeypot), as well as making references to the criminal prosecution of the administrator of a video streaming site. That's good, I'll keep that in mind if I ever set one up in Antigua. After this, whilst I felt relatively calm - I experienced crippling chest pains and my heart rate was surging fairly high in comparison to what it should be.

The couple I was intending to hand over control of nzbX to backed out, and I decided to enact my alternative plan (as per the ""how"" section) in order to protect the state of my health and the confidentiality of my users. At 6PM tomorrow, every trace of the user database will be wiped out - don't worry, the location of the origin server is a big secret and there's no way anybody could have got your information.

So, it's been a while since I submitted a post here (well, it feels like it). Firstly, I'd like to apologize to any members of this subreddit who have experienced performance (and quality issues) with nzbX within the past fortnight. We initially had an issue where our primary cluster (UK) had a complete and total drive failure (faulty batch), which led us to move over to our secondary cluster (Portugal). Our secondary cluster was never designed to handle the volume of traffic that we now have and as a result, slowed to a complete crawl.

The ability of the cluster to actually index became almost non-existent and site requests were abysmally slow. Thankfully, the API stayed fairly snappy due to the way it has been built. We made some changes, and the site started to perform in the way that it usually did - and then we hit a snag. A rather large notification of copyright infringement somehow ended up with our backup provider (someone we had not vetted as thoroughly as our primary provider) as opposed to going to our copyright agent and they quite promptly threw up their hands.

The secondary platform was turned off, and I was informed about it in a rather odd manner. Firstly, I received an email telling me that our services had been suspended due to having a balance of negative £15. That's right, we were in credit at the time. I was a bit confused and promptly called the provider, where I was cut off three times. Did I mention that I was in the middle of nowhere with one bar of signal (not even 3G), and not even a house for several miles? The timing wasn't great, to be honest.

I managed to get a stable connection to a manager eventually, who apologized greatly and said it was an issue with the billing system, and that he would fix it within the next 15 minutes. 20 minutes later, I got an email stating that we were suspended due to copyright infringement and that the account would not be reactivated. This posed a bit of a problem, our backup was the only current... backup (we have older ones, but bah!). One hour later and a lot of angry lawyer raging over their terms and what constituted infringement - and we were back online (where we promptly made 6 copies of our data, which is now happening continuously).

Our primary cluster is now back online, and the domain is pointed there. Or is it? In order to protect the identity of the origin server, we have moved it. On top of moving it, access is routed through a number of reverse caching proxies that we have full control over - with all logging disabled. This has allowed us to greatly increase our system availability and stability, and we don't have to worry about a large (and invalid) notification scaring our host in to turning us off. The domain points to no less than three caching proxies at any one time, and a new proxy can be brought online in less than 60 seconds. At any one time, there are three online hot spares in alternate locations ready to go. In terms of long-term availability and stability - I can now safely say that we're probably the index with the most overkill setup. We have to fill in the gaps from the past fortnight in terms of missing releases, but this is being done at the moment.

nzbX has come a long way since it was started. We introduced a ratings system a number of months ago, and then promptly switched it from a numeric (1 - 10) method to a simple upvote/downvote system, which resulted in increased feedback on the platform. Quite bluntly, people wanted to go ""good"" or ""bad"" - not rate release from 1 to 10 based on a changing and arbitrary method. Other indexes are now finally catching up with this. We were the first to come out with a global comments ecosystem, and are continuing to make a number of changes to it in order to make it viable (the consumption and publishing of newznab spotnab comments is coming soon).

We now have 120,235 users and a release database of 3,966,133 releases - though not all are visible since we retain ""dodgy"" (spam, passworded, etc) releases server side for historical purposes. We have had over three and a half million searches done via the site, seven million NZB downloads - and over one hundred million API requests. Sometimes, I get the feeling that somebody out there has a very broken Headphones install.

We're making some changes to the way that our indexing software works as well. See, it's wrote in glorious python - and can complete processing of a single group in a fraction of a second (after header retrieval time; which is generally under a second per group). We're about to put live our production version, which has greatly increased performance and reliability over the existing solution. As we'll also be switching our usenet service provider to our **OWN SERVICE** (more information coming in the next few days), I don't think there will be an index out there that will be able to compete with us on this front.

Most importantly, we still are (and always will be) a completely free service. We're completely public and are not invite only. We do not charge ridiculous amounts of money for a ""VIP"" account, and requests against our API are unlimited, no matter where they come from. Our premium feature set, is our public feature set. On top of the great features that we already have, we'll be releasing the following in the next few days.

&gt;A discovery system that is more reliable than the current (and highly buggy) broken piece of crap.

&gt;A cover view system for content discovery.

&gt;Additional filters on search and browse.

If you can think of anything else you'd like to see, just let me know. Anyway, that's all for now - aside from a shameless plug for https://nuplay.co (woo!). Also, stop giving private indexes so much money - profiting from copyright in the way that they are seems a bit ironic to me.

I have not checked any of these for anything other than an available registration page. I can't speak for their reliability or the quality of their index, and I haven't made sure they have SSL enabled. I also can't promise that a sudden flood of users from Reddit won't take down some poor soul's home server. I would however bet that any site using a dynamic DNS service is probably good to avoid.

This is either in the form of having to pay for an invite, or in the form of having crippled access to an API until you pay up some money. Your average person seems to think that this is about covering server costs, but it honestly isn't. If an index is charging more than a dollar for you to have unrestricted access - you're being ripped off.

You might ask how I know this? Well, as I seem to run one of the largest public indexes - with traffic levels that would probably seem astronomical to some people, I'd like to think I have some sort of idea. Take a certain well known private index charging a fair bit amount of money. Let us pretend that I know that their user base is under 3,000 users and that their traffic levels aren't that high... despite that, they're claiming thousands upon thousands a month in server costs - which is nothing more than a sham.

Before we continue to give these people money, I think we should call them to account in terms of transparency. How many users and traffic is the amount supporting? How much has been donated in total? How much is the infrastructure costing, and are they being ridiculous? The answer in most cases will be ""not much, a lot and probably not much"".

Given I could now run an index the scale of nzbX for under $1,000 per month (so based on that scale, the traffic of pretty much every damn private index out there) - what excuses are people coming out with? See, we don't even charge. Why? We made enough to cover part of our initial expenses and then we stopped worrying about payment. Profiting directly from copyright infringement makes people just as bad as the RIAA and MPAA in my opinion. You want to make money through indirect advertising? Sure. You want people to cough up a small fortune? Go fuck yourself.

Support the smaller private indexes that charge maybe $1 a month at most for unlimited access. With the advent of comment ecosystems (via newznab's spotnab plugin or nzbx's ecosystem), being tied in to a single index seems somewhat redundant now - especially given that everybody seems to be running the same damn Newznab install dressed up differently. Don't buy in to the bullshit ""OMG WE RELEASED THIS NEW FEATURE AND WERE THE FIRST OR ONLY ONES TO DO IT"" (they weren't), or the bullshit ""WE WERE VOTED BEST &lt;X&gt; OR &lt;Y&gt; IN A FUCKING VOTE THAT NEVER HAPPENED"". There is NOTHING special about these so called premium indexes. Why are they even classing themselves as premium? There is no added stability or longevity in a private index, so why worry so much? It gets even worse when an index bends over its users, then you see people asking for an invite to it anyway.

I know of a couple of indexes claiming thousands per month in costs, yet are on a couple of dedicated machines at iWeb, a budget Canadian provider or OVH - the trusty french bottom of the barrel network. It's ridiculous.

Hey, I don't want to spam /r/usenet so I will post here.

I have made some minor changes to my newznab site www.freenzb.com 

* Removed email requirement, its optional and only for password resets
* Added the ability for users to upvote and downvote files to help clean up the quality links from the dodgy ones. - not sure how to reward voters any suggestions? 
* To help with the voting I will be adding a recently downloaded list in your profile with easy up/down votes for the last X downloads. Might make it a widget somewhere (sidebar) also.
* Implemented SSL for login page. 
* I have further increased the backfill for movies and tv as they seem to be the most popular.

I am considering other things, all the developments are coming out of my pocket as I am pretty lazy to learn PHP etc.. hah.

**THE ECOSYSTEM IS NOW LIVE, GO READ.**

https://nzbx.co/docs/ecosystem

-----

One of the key components of https://nzbx.co is the backend API that powers everything, and the fact that the eventual plan is to have numerous people mirror the front-end (whilst having a fair few API / data-store mirrors as well). This API lets us do many fun things... which I'll get back to shortly.

On a different note, one major issue with private indexes is the complete lack of comments and ratings (if only because of the size of the community); which makes it difficult to quickly ascertain the quality of a post, or see if anybody has a better recommendation.

Now, nzbX now allows registered users to easily rate the quality of a release (upvote / downvote) as well as leave comments as well. What I want to do, is open this up to the world. I intend to open up the API for comments / ratings on a read-only basis to everybody, so private indexes (or public) can hook it in, to easily display a ""global"" comment/rating sentiment for a release. Going one step further, I'm going to give trusted indexes the ability to push to the ""global"" chain, allowing them to add comments and rate a release via the API.

On a smaller note, there's also a global downloads metrics; though I don't see much point in that. It's more for the ""ooh, numbers"" factor!

Now, I asked if you wouldn't mind helping us out. If you wouldn't mind, all you need to do is login to the current https://nzbx.co platform and starting rating and commenting on releases! If it's a release you've already downloaded, that's great; if it's a new one, that's also great!

I am sad to announce that Nzbsrus.com will be closing forever.

3 days ago we were visited by F.A.C.T and served a cease and desist notice.

We were given 2 choices both of which left the site being closed but to varying degrees. 

1.)  Shutdown the site and avoid any legal actions. 

2.) Keep the site running and face legal actions. Against the owners and staff. 

In the past when F.A.C.T notices were given to us they only specifically named the owner of the site, this time it included several staff members. After consutling with our lawyers we felt that it was time to close the site to avoid any legal action.

It was a hard decision to make but the intrusion &amp; impact further legal action would have on the owners family's &amp; those staff that have only ever been voluntary would not be fair.

Over the last 12 years nzbsrus has grown to become a community, we would like to thank all the users who helped keep this site running over the years. We would also like to thank all the staff who have helped over the years. 

We will be sending out refunds to the users who have recently paid. Please check your bitcoin wallets for this in a few days.

sometimes I cannot find stuff and I have to browse this nzb index, the other and his dog.  
So, for personal use I started to code my metasearch engine that crawls indexers and provides me nzbs. Very practical for hard to find stuff. 
Now, I am giving it away.
The core idea is to run a free, uncategorized search and match the input string on many indexes.

screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/4xrlPSn.jpg

It is open source and written in python so it runs on linux, Mac, win. 

**[EDIT]: thanks for the feedback, I will add many new features soon.**

**[EDIT2]: I will improve installation on all systems too. Hopefully by just providing binaries**

supported indexers:
- nzbx.co

- nzb.cc

- newsznab compatible (a lot around)

- spotweb compatible (a lot around)

I hope you find it useful. I am actively developing it so it will hopefully improve :)

&gt; We have ended the donation drive early due to an overall lack of participation and support (roughly 0.1% of registered users donated, around 0.04% of our active userbase). As of now, we are currently not accepting further donations and are relying on our own funds.

&gt; Whilst the site will continue to exist, our level of enthusiasm has obviously dropped considerably as a result of this - we barely managed to raise 25% of what we put in ourselves. What we found funny is that we saw people saying they donated... and we added up the people saying it versus the people who donated, there was quite a large differential.

Full disclosure, I have been a premium member pretty much since it launched, normally I wouldn't pay for something in its infancy, but you can tell when a developer knows what he is doing, &lt;3 Lemon.

**Problems in my opinion:**

* They are not completing key functionality of the website before starting new functionality, examples:

***Key Feature:*** Discovery filters have never worked properly and being able to sort by most popular, age + category are what made nzbmatrix great. 

***Meh Feature:*** Movies, why not just used imdb. Showing movies with no content, pointless.

* They are recreating software that have been in development for years, (sickbeard + coachpotato) into nuplay. Maybe so they can use cc payments, who knows, must be a better way around it than that.

I feel the lack of donation is down to the lack of direction of the project, the key features (as set by nzbmatrix) need to be polished, faultless and amazing before people can really have confidence, then you can explorer new things. The frustrating thing is that they feel so close, but have for so long.

Also don't be discouraged from this project, you are truly doing amazing work, but your donation drive was doom to fail. In one fell swoop you gave everyone premium access and then asked for donations, there was no incentive. Your target audience isn't exactly giving :)

Oh, I should add I didn't donate during the drive but have given money in the past, I would happily donate if I felt more confident about the indexer side of the project.

Sorry I ended up going off on one, the cause is very good putting it on its own hardware is a great idea.

It has some cool features, such as being able to 'pin' items offline to your device, so you can actually view the content while on the move. 

The app is starting to become quite stable and I have worked with various users over email to get more and more stuff added. I've got loads of good ideas lined up, so stay tuned.

Foshow is currently available from Google Play.

As you guys know, I didn't do it for money, it was just fun. 

As a parting gift from mega.nzbx, **[I have updated the open source repository of NZBMegasearch](https://github.com/pillone/usntssearch)**, so that you can:

1. **[Install your personal copy on the cloud, free and anonymously (with pwd)]    (https://github.com/pillone/usntssearch/blob/master/NZBmegasearch/openshift/openshift_install.md)**

2. **[Install it locally on your machine (or on a small server)](https://github.com/pillone/usntssearch)**

3. **[Install it for heavy traffic usage (vey low hw requirements, basically a copy of mega.nzbx.co)](https://github.com/pillone/usntssearch/blob/master/NZBmegasearch/large_server/nginx_install.md)**

I especially love (1), you can have your install on a crazy fast nerwork, completely free and with your custom config (not suitable for large user base -- CPU and traffic limitation).


These are my best efforts to decentralize and to proliferate the usage of NZBMegasearcH beyond the existence of mega.nzbx.co.

Why some think this may have been his plan all along.,Ibrowsereddits,55,8,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/17josh/nzbsrus_will_not_be_honoring_vip_lifetime/,"s0ck3t the Sysop on nzbsrus made this post back when he removed VIP:


""Anyone elses NZBsRus VIP been removed? by dan897in usenet
[–]s0ck3t 3 points 18 days ago (9|6)
Currently the lifetime option the one that is showing on the site is not working properly, All users got reset back to a 1 year subscription. We will revisit the lifetime issues at a later date, I will make a front page post when we are doing it and will likely send each user a private message. We are working as best we can to just get users back to downloading and using the site. s0ck3t""


""we will revisit the lifetime issues at a later date"" was his only response regarding the issue.

Now I read the news post that the s0ck3t made, and he claims:

"" I am happy to say at this point we have currently activated 95% 

of the VIP memberships, the other 5% are likely people who do not use the site as much."" 

The above is the part that intrigues me... if I understand this correctly s0ck3t is implying that of the 49k alleged members who got free VIP:

""...as many of you may know we had a serious

exploit found in the VIP upgrade code. This lead to 49,000 members being able to get free VIP...""

95% of those were verified as non exploiters and actual subscribers. He dismisses the other 5% as those that probably don't use the website much anyway. So where are the the 49k alleged exploit abusers? Seems to me like all this was just a ploy to harvest the majority of lifetime subscription accounts, and convert them to non-lifetime accounts:

""As with anything in life there may be special circumstances with each individual account, like those users who help the site out by making tutorials,

Help in the irc channel, and other site related things. Each account will be considered on an individual basis."".


The biggest insult here is that what is essentially special treatment will be given to those that hang around the IRC etc... I just can't get over how scummy and sketchy this whole ordeal was, I never had a problem with Nzbsrus before, but this is by far the most disgraceful move I have ever seen on their part.

I think that if s0ck3t had been straightforward from the beginning instead of implementing this after everything was said and done and everyone was hopeful shit would get back to normal, I wouldn't be so bothered - but that is clearly not the case.  


I just wanted everyone who has a subscription there to be aware of what happened, hence my reasons for this post.

I've been using usenet as my main source of downloading for the past six years. I started up filesplit.org, help found nzbzone and was a big supporter of the original nzbmatrix and newzbinV1.

I have been following the developments with newznab and the subsequent new herd of newznab nzb sites, all with the aim to fill the space that nzbmatrix once dominated.

Unfortunately a lot sites that reach a significant size experience the same issues of burdening server costs and threat of authority closures. A lot of nn sites have closed and many new pop-up every week, which makes the current nzb scene very fast moving. There are a few big stable nn sites (dog and nzb.su), but both are very difficult for new users to participate.

I want to run an NZB site that boasts the following:

Operates on minimal server costs. 
Requires no registration to download or browse NZBs.
No paywalls, completely free.
Brings back the high quality of user editing. So will be completely user edited like nzbmatrix

If big torrent sites like piratebay and kat can do all of the above then why can't we.

I have an idea, that is not new nor is it ground-breaking, but rather an implementation of existing services. I simply want to use a forum based site to manually index raw usenet search engines like http://www.nzbclub.com/ and nzbindex.nl. Users will find a raw post on one of these search engines and then post a cleaned and info rich post on our forum. If users want to download the NZB they will be directed to the subpage on the search engine.

In my opinion this allows me to achieve all of the above but most importantly builds an active usenet community, that puts quality over quantity. The absense of hosting NZBs hopefully works around the legal issue, but I guess only time can tell on this one.

I'm aware this is no easy feat to achieve, but I've seen it been done twice and it can surely be done again. I'm therefore using this as opportunity to see if anyone would be interested in becoming involved either as moderators or editors.

It is NOT specialized in Movies or Games ... it has NO specialization.

It can be extended to work for Movies and Games and Music and what ever you desire.

In fact Movies, Games and Music is there already.
So are a few other plugins like a Boxcar Notifier, a Trakt.tv watchlist MediaAdder or Sabnzbd Downloader.
It can update if you run from a git install or the Mac binary.
Plugins are downloadable and updateable separately from repositories.

The app uses the newznab api for nzb fetching and sabnzbd api for pushing.

I would love some feedback! If you hate it, please let me know why! I haven't been working on it that long and I've  updated it a lot already, so the design may change from time to time...

All kinds of blargh, right? Before people claim this is a sham, I am happy to provide verification to Brett from the moderation team - though given the level of personal information involved with this, I am not comfortable posting this publically.

Now, I have no issues with continuing to handle the hosting infrastructure (which is now all but impervious to takedown), occasional development on the platform - or other things in general. I do not have the time or the health to deal with handling spam, doing manual uploads/checks/everything or handling DMCA requests (which I highly advise that people should do - no need to piss people off further).

The site is still doing well, 129,746 registered users, an insane amount of daily uniques, close to 5 million releases and finally, a little over 10,000 rated releases.

There are only a few rules I have in place should somebody decide they want to take over.

1. I will continue to host the infrastructure in order to ensure the damn thing stays up.

2. Adverts? Nope. Charging for access? Nope. You won't be paying a penny in operating costs, and there's not a chance in hell that you'll be taking a penny in profit on my watch.

3. You will not have access to the users table, at any point. You will be able to send emails to the user base via an online tool, but you will be restricted by amount - and any attempts at soliciting donations will be filtered out automatically (if the filter actually works).

4. When I got rid of premium, my goal was to turn nzbX in to what I originally intended for it to be - a free and open indexing platform. I can tell you now that you can run an index for next to nothing (as an example, nzbrus was shown to cost $800 a month), yet quite a few ""private"" indexes are turning over far more than that in donations. Profiting from piracy kind of proves the RIAA right, so I just want a big free alternative to be out there.

PS: This is not a thread to bitch about whether you like the indexer or not, whether you like me or not - or whether a specific file is missing. A heart attack has given me a new perspective on giving a fuck.

Dear Sir, Madam,

The BREIN foundation acts against piracy of entertainment content (music, film, eBooks, computer games and other interactive software) on behalf of rights holders and interested parties such as authors, performing artists, publishers, producers and distributors. Together these rights holders represent the lionÂ’s share of the intellectual property rights on entertainment content worldwide.

We have found that one of your customers operates the illegal website http://www.usenet-crawler.com/ (IP 77.72.147.85). The website is offering a choice of popular titles in the area of films, and music that are made available without the required prior permission of the rights owners. The website constitutes a platform for its many users to offer and share these titles which are known to be protected by copyright and neighbouring rights (e.g. Wreck It Ralph; Rise Of The Guardians; Finding Nemo; see screenshots). This is unlawful.

The website is structurally making use of the availability on internet of unauthorized files with entertainment content without taking into account the interests of copyright and neighbouring rights holders. Such conduct is in conflict with the due care proper in social traffic and is unmistakably unlawful with respect to the rights holders whose interests are taken at heart or represented by BREIN. The website is causing extensive damage to these rights holders. The website is being maintained by one of your customers.

The owner of the site has not ceased the abovementioned illegal activities upon demand. My request to you is to arrange for the immediate closing down of this illegal website.

In the event you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

I only spent a few hours on it, and it's the first bash scripting I've attempted.  

It assumes SickBeard, Headphones, and LazyLibrarian are started from source, and SABnzbd, Plex, and CouchPotato are apps in /Applications. I also used [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) to create a 'Monitoring' app as a central location for using all the apps, so that's included in the script, but you need to download Fluid and set up the actual application yourself to use it.  

You can customize the folder with the projects' sources if you change source_dest in the beginning of the file to be the correct path. Additionally, you can change the ports in the first few lines to reflect your actual setup.
Requires bash 4+. To run it, ""bash arr"" at the command prompt. To make it runnable anywhere, drop the script or symlink it into /usr/local/bin and call 'arr' from the command line to get help info with everything you need to know to use it.

Now, it still has a rather active user base - with us now having reached a little over 127,000 registered members. I don't intend to shut the site down, and I've reached out to a few people to see if they're interested in taking over. I'll happily continue to host the platform, but I'm looking for somebody to take over control of the site aside from that. Ideally, somebody who has the time and inclination to make the spam filter more aggressive, add and block posters, etc. All of the functionality is available, I just don't have the time to deal with it.

If you think you'd do a good job taking over nzbX, drop an email to me@lemon.sx and we'll talk about it.

In other news, nuPlay is being open sourced in order to put the future of the development in to the hands of the community. I will continue to be a core contributor to the platform, but having one person handling development is proving to be a bit of a pain in the ass. We'll continue on the hardware side of things, however.

Who knows, we may throw you an invite for hanging out.

Hello r/usenet-

I am bamathrasher, co-*insert fancy title here* of PFmonkey.com. Like most people operating newznab index sites these days, my partner and I were looking for new homes after the fall of the matrix. We both come from professional sysadmin/IT technical backgrounds so when we discovered NN it was a good fit. At first we both operated our own index sites before deciding to join forces to create one, much larger and powerful index site, and so PFmonkey.com was born.

Now at first we had zero intentions of going public, this was an index created for our personal use and friends and family only. After all of the work we have put into the site, of course we want to share it with some other people so our direction changed. A few months ago we decided we would open the site up for limited registrations, to 150 members to be exact, and we prepared to do so. How we prepared is simple, I personally watched this sub-reddit for the biggest gripes and complaints about existing index sites and we really focused on how to remedy those. 

What's different about us? We are 2 admins who have taken time to learn the platform so that we can focus on site performance as our first priority. I've registered on other NN index sites in the past and my biggest complaint is slow load times, ugly spam posts and lack of admin support.  I'm not bashing any index site, I think it's great that people are willing to put their time, effort and money into keeping usenet chugging along. I'm also not promising our site is perfect either.

Our goal is to share our dedication to building a clean, usable, fast index with a small-ish tight knit community that will share our passion for keeping it low key and clean. We have no desire to replace or even compete with the large index sites like DogNZB, nzb.su, nzbX, etc. We figure the smaller the community the better chance of lasting for years to come. I know you guys are frustrated with donating good money only for the site to go down a week later.

So... we invite you to come check us out, you can join the IRC channel on synIRC at #pfmonkey. Registration is capped at 150 users so if this sounds appealing to you at all, join quickly. 

EDIT: Can't believe I forgot to post this, we currently index 160 groups, all of which are backfilled 2 years.. resulting in a fairly clean 3.5mil releases.

EDIT #2: 37 slots remaining. The turnout has been great, thank you everyone who has joined and provided feedback.

EDIT #3: All registration slots have been filled. Sorry to all who didn't get a slot, we may consider opening for additional registrations in the future but since the focus is on keeping the community small and tight-knit I can't make any promises. Will post with updates.

I've been posting a lot to usenet lately and have run into a lot of hard lessons.  
First, let me go over the programs I've used.

This is the subject header ideally used in YENC programs:  
Release_Name_Here [$1/$2] - ""$F"" yEnc  
e.g. [Redump.org] Sony PlayStation (USA) (20130213) Games [$1/$2] - ""$F"" yEnc  

&gt;**[YENC-POWER-POST-A&amp;A-v11b](http://powerpost.free.fr/)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ajE0Qa0.jpg)  
**Pros**  
-Seems to be the most-used uploading program  
-Fairly reliable  
-Easy to use  
-Shows speed/progress/time remaining  
-Allows Par2/sfv/nzb creation  
-Allows you to set upload speed limit in real-time  
-Allows files to be removed from queue while posting  
-Open source  

**Cons**  
-Allows only four simultaneous upload threads meaning you likely won't be able to upload at full speed  
-Crashes if queuing too many files  
-Crashes if file sizes are large (4.37GB)  
-Can be buggy and problematic if your internet connection fails during upload  

&gt;**[YENC-POWER-POST-GB-12 Beta 12.2.7.0](http://www.alt-bin.com/misc/gbpp.html)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/89lRfnY.png)  
**Pros**  
-Same features as above but allows 12 simultaneous threads. Still not enough to max out high speeds  
-Still has a website up with working links  
-More options such as Auto Skip on Errors, Disconnects, and Timeouts  
-Allows files to be removed from queue while posting  
-Open source  

**Cons**  
-Contains same crashing issues original contains with large queues and files  
-Most of the expanded options are useless to most people  
-Tacky marijuana logo on the edited program icon  

&gt;**YENC-POWER-POST-GB&amp;L8 52 Thread w/ Progress! (GBlazer &amp; Latenite's Revenge)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/amLSi39.png)  
**Pros**  
-Allows 52 simultaneous upload threads allowing you to likely max out your upload speed  
-Allows files to be removed from queue while posting  
-More faithful to the original A&amp;A-v11b  

**Cons**  
-Doesn't show current bandwidth usage in post progress window  
-No official/trustworthy website to download from, can be hard to find  
-Contains same crashing issues original contains with large queues and files  

&gt;**[Easy Usenet Uploader 1.0.73](http://abook.ws/index.php?topic=2513.0)**  

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/LMFRkwa.png)  

**Pros**  
-Modern/appealing interface  
-Allows up to 25 simultaneous upload threads (I max speed at 18 threads, no less)  
-Speeds seem more consistent than YENC Power Post  
-Has a log window  

**Cons**  
-Does not allow files to be removed from queue while posting  
-Cannot change max upload speed once posting begins  
-Crashes and performs terribly during large queues or file sizes  
-Doesn't seem to allow standard subject headers (binsearch.info says on one of my posts: ""unidentified files (note to poster: put quotes around the filename in the subject)"")  
-High CPU usage while posting (35% on an E8400 Duo Core when posting  )

As you can see, there's no such thing as a perfect uploader. Each one has some glaring problem and I haven't found anyone who has suggested a better option. Of course, these have all been Windows applications, 
so maybe the best option is in Linux? 

As of right now, I tend to prefer Easy Usenet Uploader just due to its speed. 

When I used YENC Power Post GB12 to make a 537GB post, I had a large number of files error out which looked [like this](http://i.imgur.com/pvqwOCF.png), so I'm now using Easy Usenet Uploader to repost it, but 
it crashes if I queue every file so I have to post 40~ files at a time and keep queuing them little by little--there's no queue all and go. 

If a program allowed all of the pros and none of the cons above, it'd be pretty much perfect.

1. What is usenet?

2. What tools do I use to browse usenet? Windows Mac Linux

3. ~~What tools do I use to download from usenet?~~

* After purchasing access to a news provider and downloading the nzb of a particular release from an indexer, a news reader can be used to open the nzb and start the download of the file from your provider. A commonly used news reader is [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/).    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cj5c0)

4. What is an indexer?

5. What are headers?

6. ~~What is an NZB file?~~
* NZB files are the most common tool used to download files from usenet. NZB files were invented to simplify the process of downloading multi-part files. Because usenet was designed to download smaller packets of data, most files you will download are actually broken into many smaller blocks of data. An NZB file helps your usenet client locate and download those specific file parts from your usenet provider.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciewl)

7. ~~How is usenet different than torrents?~~

* With torrents, a file is downloaded from multiple sources. The speed of a download is variable and highly dependent on the number of people sharing a file. With usenet, you are downloading a file directly from a server. The speed of your download, assuming a good provider, will almost certainly be the maximum your ISP allows.
Another point to mention is that with torrents, access to certain files can be limited to the websites you belong to. 
With usenet, when a file gets uploaded to a group, every website indexing that group has access to the same file. Whether a particular file gets posted or not, and whether certain obfuscation can be read, is up to the automation process of the indexer.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciohe)

8. ~~Is usenet safe?~~

* Usenet can be fairly dangerous for those not paying attention. It is very common for viruses and malware to be packaged with releases. Using a reputable indexer, reading comments on releases, ensuring appropriate file sizes and names with pre databases, and scanning downloaded files with a good AV are good ways to stay safe on usenet.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciohe)

9. ~~What is a provider?~~

* In order to get access to files on usenet one must use a provider to download those files. Providers are servers that store the content on usenet, and allow one to download said content. When a file gets uploaded to a particular provider, other providers will download that file from the server it was uploaded to. Theoretically, all providers should have the same content because of this, however in practice there are differences.
Sometimes files may not propagate correctly so a particular file may be broken on one provider but not another. Providers may also limit the amount of time they store a file after it is uploaded to their servers. Providers may also limit the bandwidth to their servers, or have different connection limits.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cj14y)

10. ~~Should I use a VPN account with usenet?~~

* Using a VPN account with usenet is beneficial. There are two major points at which your IP address could be logged and stored while downloading a file. First, when you obtain the .nzb from an indexer, and second, when you are actually downloading from your provider. Although with https your ISP will not see what you are downloading, anyone with access to the logs of the indexer or provider could see what you have donwloaded or planned to download. With a (reputable) VPN, those points of identification would be rendered neutral as they would obtain the IP of your VPN server instead of yours.

11. What is a tracker?

12. ~~How do I get invites to private trackers?~~
* There are a few ways that you can join a private tracker. One method is by asking for an invite in /r/usenetinvites. Redditors periodically share invitations to these sites. Another way is by following blogs and forums that discuss usenet. Finally, participating in the usenet community (whether it be on Reddit, IRC, or another forum) will help increase your chance of getting invited to a private tracker.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciewl)

13. How do I just browse usenet?

14. Why are things not completing?  What is a broken download?

15. Can you automate all of this stuff?

16. I have heard about this “Holy trinity”.  What is it?

17. Why should I pay for something that I can get for free?

18. ~~Should I connect through SSL?~~

* Some Usenet providers allow users to connect through SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer. By enabling SSL your Usenet traffic will be encrypted. This means that your ISP, or any other person looking at your traffic, will be unable to see the specific content that you are downloading. In general, it is recommended that users enable SSL as it has no noticeable impact on transmission speeds. Using SSL also can help prevent bandwidth shaping from network administrators. Finally, SSL gives users a greater degree of legal protection from accidental copyright infringement.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9civ13)

19. Why are there so many different usenet providers?

20. ~~What is the difference between a block account and an unlimited account.~~
* To use usenet a news provider usually sells access to the files stored on their servers. Depending on the particular plan your purchase an unlimited number of files can be downloaded from their servers, or you could be limited to only downloading up to a certain amount of files (which is called a block account). So for a block account, if you purchase 100GB, you can download a total of 100GB of files before you have to purchase another block.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cjdej)

21. ~~Why should I have a block account on top of my unlimited account?~~
* Because of errors in file propagation among usenet providers, DMCA take downs (accidentally on linux distributions), and possibly lower retention on your main provider over your block account, content could fail on one provider, but be accessible on another.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cjnnh)

22. What are some good free trackers?

23. Is there any good mobile applications?

24. What is PreDB?

* A pre database compiles the names, sizes, and other pertinent information about files which have been released under official scene standards by a scene group. Scene releases are generally considered of higher quality because of a strict adherence to certain guidelines designed to ensure quality and compatibility.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9ciik5)

25. ~~What is a Par and RAR?~~

* A .rar file is a file which has been compressed to a smaller size. Files downloaded from the internet are often compressed to decrease the time needed to download the file, as well as decrease the cost to the entity hosting the file.
A par file is designed to check for, and attempt to repair damage to a file.    
[Discuss here](http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1c2ui0/please_help_me_update_the_faqs_i_have_already/c9cj9ik)

26. ~~How do I repair a release?~~
* Many newsreaders (such as [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/)) will automatically repair or attempt to repair broken files using par files after download. If not through your newsreader, a program such as [quickpar](http://www.quickpar.org.uk/) can be used to do it as well.

However, one of my favorite features about nzbmatrix that I miss very much was the tables on the home page that displayed the last 5-10 releases for each category.

On XBMC I use the Aeon Nox theme and use the TVCatchup app (UK live channels) with Futubox for Sky channels (I wouldn't recommend buying this. I did a review and got it for free. It's laggy but does the trick for sport sometimes.). Navi X is another favourite.

I then use my iPhone as a remote using XBMC official app and use Couch for downloads.

So while everyone freaks out about sites like NZBmatrix and either talk about setting up a new indexer or going back to the old fashioned way of searching/surfing headers - it won't help either way since USPs will just axe items they received notifications about.

The only change I can see that will take place that would change anything currently is the obfuscation of headers and the use of encryption.

Now that they have all been hit, or in the process of being hit, it's only natural that we were next.

Its not because people talked about it, posted about it, or set it up for one of their friends, its because we were next. PERIOD.

The problem is that universally I have noticed that the date field is used as an absolute, i.e. if you select a rating of 7 you will only get results between 7.0 and 7.9.

I suggest that this field should instead be implemented as a minimum, whereby selecting a 7 would in fact return anything with a rating of 7 or above. Rating is used as a guideline for a minimum standard, not an absolute value. If you choose a 7, it doesn't mean you don't want to see any results with a better rating.

Mylar can be found here (with screenshots): https://github.com/evilhero/mylar

For those that don't know, Mylar is an automated comic book downloader based on Headphones. While the template remains the same, the innards have been completely rewritten obviously (comics are not the same as music).  It's been in active development now for over a year, and has come quite a long way in that short time thanks in large part to the users that have helped with enhancements, ideas and of course bug reports.

The development branch is the most 'up-to-date', as the master only gets updated monthly - primarily due to the fact that alot of the stuff going into the development branch hasn't been tested fully (or at least to a level that I'm comfortable with). If something's broken, the dev branch will have the fix more quickly than the master.

Mylar does the following (amongst other things):

* Monitor the weekly comic release list for series that are being watched (ie. pullist)
* SABnzbd / NZBget / Blackhole support
* Multiple newznab support, as well as built-in support for DOGnzb and nzb.su. A Raw Indexer is included as well.
* Torrent support for both CBT and KAT via Watch directory OR send-to-seedbox (post-processing has yet to be introduced for this as of yet)
* RSS Feed support for both nzbs and torrents
* Alternate Search Names per series
* Post-Processing (both via SABnzbd and Manually-run)
* Notifications on snatches/downloads (NMA, Prowl, Pushover)
* Custom Folder and Filenaming options
* Metatagging (through the awesome ComicTagger)
* Readlist / StoryArc managements (ability to keep track of story arc issues, download missing issues, etc)
* Import existing directories as series (available, but mixed results)

If there are any issues / problems, please check on github for a solution or submit an issue.

As an FYI, Mylar has the ability now to use only ComicVine data and does so by default (up until earlier this year, it was a combination of GCD and ComicVine and resulted in a lot of problems for many users).

Given the closing of NewsBin2 and NzbMatrix (albeit for differing reasons), what can be the strategy of the new index siteops to resist the inevitable advances of their opponents using similar tactics to close them down?

A few thoughts I had

I see the sites/ops models categorized into one of these 4 groups;

1) Cash in : Ops are in for the quick buck opportunity, spin up a community, cash in and then close out. 

2) Stealth : invite only, low awareness, managed growth/costs.

3) Community : Ops are genuinely invested in making a long term service that's popular, effective and self sustaining through donations (or complementary businesses; advertising, etc).

4) Here today, gone tomorrow : Ops are there for the lulz and altruism; opportunistic use of available resources (sourcecode &amp; hosting/bandwidth) to throw up a site to the public which once it becomes popular will collapse under its own weight unless it moves to model #3.

If you're an effective Community site, you have to scale and so there has to be a funding model to either break even or make a modest buck. Based on past events, it appears that your future can go two ways: if you're making money from running the site, you're subject to being prosecuted for profiting by making copyrighted material easier to locate (Newzbin2), if you're not, then they'll make it untenable for you to continue (NzbMatrix).

I'd expect that the inevitable contact by opponents will happen much sooner than we saw with old Community sites, now that they have their precedents in place.

Do Community sites have a future, through some new strategy of resilience, or will we see the predominant model become something else?

I have been doing a lot of research on usenet and its setup with SABnzbd, sickbeard and Couchpotato.  I have not decided on linux or windows as the base os yet but I feel comfortable in setting everything up with either.  I will then either run an HTPC using XBMC as the interface or stream the content using my PS3 or Boxee box.

My first thought was to build a small server to run the content aggregator software.  I was going to setup a small raid five server with a couple of xeon chips and around 12 Gigs of ram.  This system would be in the basement and would run all the time.  I would then have an HTPC or equivalent system on my TV in which to stream the content.

Would it be a better idea to just build one small server and have it run everything?  This would eliminate any streaming issues from the server to the tv.  If I place the server in the basement I may have to settle for wifi connection to my network and I fear that will slow things down for my purposes. 

I also thought of just running SABnzbd and everything on my desktop but it would have to be on all day to pull down content.  

So for a tldr,  Would it be better to use a 2 system setup for usenet or build 1 system that can do it all?

* I currently push the little green arrow to force a search/refresh when i add a movie - is this neccessary?

I had this idea today. Understand that right now, I have done little research on the subject, and it may not be feasible or practical to actually implement it, but I'd like opinions anyway.

The idea would be to make a meta nzb search engine (General principle of nzbmegasearch, which was a great idea btw), that uses libtorrent of something similar to sync a list of existing indexers between every single deployed node.

The goal is to enable everyone to install said software on one's server, and have every.single.instance of it synchronize information, so that :

* No single takedown can affect the health of the entire swarm
* Everyone can use it, without requiring one single person to host it on a very traffic-heavy platform

If the project proves feasible, I'd also like to add ratings (simple up/down votes), commenting, and DMCA/missing blocks/password reporting. All of this would of course also be synchronized between nodes, within reasonable limits.

Last idea would be to add an API call for SB/CP/(insert automated download software name here) to automatically report failures, and the reasons behind it, to enable the software to automatically bury nzb's that were subject to too many reported takedowns/failures. I'm not sure about how feasible this would be to integrate it into the existing software, but the idea is pleasing to me anyway.

I would do the development part with a friend of mine and host a few starting nodes, but I probably won't bother if you guys think it'd be wasted time.

Any thoughts ? My reasoning probably has some flaws in it, so critics are greatly appreciated.

I have been using usenet for many years now and recently stumbled upon this sub. In reading through it, I have come to realize that I am using usenet quite differently than most people, specifically in regards to nzb files. For the vast majority of the stuff I want, I use Newsleecher's supersearch function. For more obscure stuff, I use a combination of binsearch and usenet4all. My setup has been working for me since I started usenet probably 7 years ago, so I haven't kept up much with the 'scene'. 


I see everyone discussing the various nzb indexers and their merits, with a bunch of names completely foreign to me (DOGnzb, nzb.su, nzbx.co etc.) many invite-only. I guess my main question is, am I missing out on something great by using my methods of searching? Some massive quality of life improvement? I can see that supersearch and binsearch seem to be of a more crude variety of 'raw' search. Is the only difference the processing/grouping of the headers/releases and spam filtering?

Thanks in advance for any insight.

&gt;Please note that although some providers offer a cheaper service, they do not carry the same level of service that Giganews does.  We currently offer the highest retention, number of groups (over 111,000),as well as the extra value of our ever expanding services such as the Vypr VPN, the Accelerator, and future upgrades and services that will only be available to Giganews Members.  We advise that you check with your new provider to see if they carry all of your favorite groups and services before your cancellation takes effect.

I'm a new usenet-er and am wondering about the potential for capping from my ISP.  I have Verizon FiOs in the North Eastern US.  

I have a mid-tier plan which is something like 2500/1500 down/up.  Since I started using usenet, I've been padding my collection with the things I've been meaning to collect for sometime now.  Because of this initial burst, you can imagine that my download bandwidth has been abnormally high as I have been running at 1.3MB down for roughly 36 hours.  

I was wondering if ISPs follow this data and if they take measures to prevent abuse like capping or inspecting the data.  I am using astraweb over SSL.

Any light you guys could shed on the subject would be greatly appreciated.  Should I be manually throttling my download speed (i.e. an hour max, an hour at 400Kbps, an hour off, an hour at 50Kbps, then restart the cycle.

As I see it, the previous issue was that matrix had lots of people that commented, now these people are split all over the shop and hence no comments get made.

We could add a small gamification system to encourage comments and provided trusted users, the system would allow the user to specify the provider they are using, and hence if something is incomplete.

This would be quite easy to knock up, assuming there is some unique key in the nzb that each host could use to get the required comments (I have not looked at the file structure of a nzb)

With that said, i have a few questions i'm hoping some folks here can help me out with. I've read up on the basic way to prepare and upload the files (RARing, PARing, SFV, NFO, NZB Creation etc) but i still have some questions:

1. As this content may or may not be ""free"" how does one go about uploading it safely so as not to be ""caught"" or sued. (Beyond SSL between me and my provider) 
2. I subscribe to supernews and have an monthly unlimited account. I assume i can upload content using the same service. 
3. After uploading it, will my provider log that it was me who uploaded this content? How do i ensure i remain anonymous. 
4. After uploading it to my provider's server, will they synchronize or distribute the files to other providers? (Astraweb, giganews, etc) Or do i have to upload the content to each server? (I guess i don't really know how Usenet works...)

I thought private torrent trackers were set up more for the reason of monitoring users' peer / seed ratios rather than some form of security. The same concept just doesn't seem to apply to nzb indexing.

It seems all the indexers set up in the wake of the matrix go through an initial stage in which invites are dished out on forums or wherever before giving members the exclusive right to give out invites as they see fit. 

Obviously copyright owners have more resources to throw at getting invites to all these private indexers than any individual. So if it's possible for me to get an invite just through spending time on different forums, then I'm sure it's possible for copyright owners also.

Want to run Usenet Trinity with Netflix...,squired,15,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/skrx9/advice_on_building_an_htpc_for_my_sister_want_to/,"Crossposting from [/r/cordcutters](/r/cordcutters) because you guys rock, I often post here, and you guy's know your shit.. Any tips?

____
My sister and brother-in-law have been staying with me awhile and have fallen in love with cordcutting and the Usenet Holy Trinity. They move into their new place in a couple of months and would like to do something similar themselves. 

My setup is rather involved and serious overkill for them. I would like theirs to be a relatively small, self-contained and low-maintenance ""one box"" system. I've played with STB's (own and use a Revue) but aren't wild about them. 
_________________________

My thought is a ""Newegg box"" running linux with XBMC, SabNZB, CouchPotato, and SickBeard. They're pretty blase' about quality so 1Tb with current pricing should suffice for now.

Netflix is a must though so would that require Windows?

What kind of hardware would you recommend? Any site/info where I can read up on it?

I'm not even sure what a reasonable budget for a built box should be. $250? $450? Obviously cheap is great but they also understand that everything is cheap when you consider dropping cable. 
____
tl:dr: Would like to build a ""one box solution"" HTPC that supports Usenet Trinity and Netflix. Any tips on where to start?

_____

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the advice guys! I've been up to my eyeballs researching this and have ordered an [Acer Revo RL70-UR10P](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883103423) for $330. There are a lot of choices out there and the field has been fairly difficult to parse as everyone naturally wants to cheer-lead for their setup of choice (not here, just in general). In the end, STB's (Roku, Revue,  Apple TV, WDTV, Boxxee, etc) aren't quite there yet and the lower power requirements of the Revo vs. most custom jobs was a huge draw. ($2 per month vs. $10+). 

I run a Plex-centric system in my own home but will be trying out XMBC for for sister and brother-in-law as it offers quite a few advantages. SportsDevil and format support being particularly enticing considering their viewing habits.

I'm sure I'll run into issues but I'll keep you guy's updated. I'm pretty stoked about the new box and thanks for all your advice!",,False,,t5_2qucj,True,,trusted,True,t3_skrx9,http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/skrx9/advice_on_building_an_htpc_for_my_sister_want_to/,

I'm using a pretty standard set up: Sabnzbd, Astraweb, NZBMatrix as the primary and then the others as backup, SickBeard.  For the most part I'm very happy with it, but a few things surprised me.  

First, I didn't realize that files could be incomplete.  For instance, Sick Beard was trying to pull some old episodes for me and got stuck on a lot of them because they were missing articles.  Is there a way to know that a file is potentially likely to not be able to complete before downloading it?  I had to resort to torrents to get these missing episodes.

Second, I usually got x264 bdrips that were about 1-2 GBs in size from message boards.  The boards or filestube had a great selection of these, but the index sites seem to be seriously lacking in these.  I see either really large 720p or 1080p x264 rips or a lot of xvid copies.  Are there places I can find these, or do I have to go back to file lockers (what remains of them)?

However, I'm pretty happy with it in general because of sick beard. That is one great program!  Even if I can't get the movies I want off usenet and have to supplement it with file lockers and torrents (which really seem to have much better selection), sick beard alone is worth the $11 per month.",,False,,t5_2qucj,False,,,True,t3_oxo6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/oxo6r/just_got_usenet_initial_thoughts/,

* Netgear ReadyNAS RN10400
* Synology DiskStation DS413j

I am Ron Yokubaitis, the Co-CEO of Giganews, the worlds premier Usenet provider. I also run several other central intelligence fronts in Austin, Texas with my wife Carolyn including Data Foundry data centers which are covertly powered by hidden nuclear reactors. Server co-location space is then sold at our facilities at exorbitant prices to numerous power company fronts on the Texas Interconnection power grid. We supply power from our nuclear reactors to those companies, our other fronts, and various black sites via high voltage underground power lines free from oversight and regulation.
We hide many of our nuclear engineers under our internal Powerhouse Management front company, but our revolutionary water cooled data centers are nothing compared to what we have with Giganews. If you've never used Giganews before, let me tell you all about it and the Usenet network.
Usenet is a network of companies worldwide that share news posts called articles organized into folders called newsgroups. Usenet is different than Twitter, Facebook, or news websites and predates the web. All social media is a copy of the worldwide sharing that continues to take place on Usenet to this day.
While news websites are limited to the common groups of say, Sports, Business, and Entertainment, Giganews has much more. In fact, we have over 110,000 different groups! Whether you're a godless heathen that reads alt.atheism, an animal lover browsing pictures in alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.beastiality, or you want to rant about the perils of running a central intelligence front you started via demonic pacts in alt.demonic.possession, Giganews is The Company for you.
When I say news posts, this can mean an email-like text post on rec.guns talking about how to outscore Lanza for example. Other examples are files uploaded as “binary” posts which are separated into several thousand parts which can be recombined back into files easily using our Mimo software. ""Taken 2"" on Bluray is a good example of a binary post, and it can be found in our alt.binaries.x264 group. You can find other binary posts such as pictures of our enemies children in alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.hard-core.pre-teen, alt.binaries.pictures.totty, alt.binaries.pictures.lsm, alt.binaries.pictures.ls-series, alt.binaries.pictures.ls-models, and alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.rape.
The last example is what is called ""cross posting"" when the same content is uploaded into multiple newsgroups. Posts to more than 4 groups is considered spamming and we have ZERO TOLERANCE for spam. Each spam uploaded through our service will cost you a $50 cleanup fee and we closely monitor traffic to enforce this. Spam is unacceptable to us because it is unacceptable to you, and we know exactly what our customers like.
You can download or upload anything besides spam through us. We also hide your web based internet traffic with our Goldenfrog VyprVPN service. Using VyprVPN, you could use one of our untraceable IPs to hypothetically form and control a botnet to take down a pesky corporation or a country (only if they don't pay the ransom). The criminal uses are endless!
Just don't tell us your crimes – your legal protection depends on us not knowing whats on or what goes through our servers, and we definitely do not know ;) You can trust that we wont blackmail you with our detailed logs, and we don't even have an obligation to share the data with law enforcement as Goldenfrog is based in the Caymans.
With a Giganews account and flexible morals, you'll never need to pay anyone else for the following: Blu-ray or DVD movies, cable tv, music, e-books, software, console games, pornography, or child pornography ever again. While not exactly licensed, its all part of the irresistible charm of Giganews. Contact me and I'll tell you where to find what you're looking for. I know better than our own Usenet search engine where the best content is.
While our price is over 3x the competition, we have something most do not: Invisibility. With police detectives, politicians, lobbyists, federal special agents, and central intelligence in key positions in our web of fronts, we have very deep connections to fight for your online rights and anonymity. Our adviser sees a threat coming, so we're moving Giganews data to our Goldenfrog storage servers as our own invisible client.
Our invisibility comes from our third Co-CEO whom is our god, the 1st demon named Baal whom we worship and greatly revere. I made pacts with my god in my earlier years where I depended on his ability to hide my subrosa activities. I paid with my soul, but was the transaction not worth a great deal to you? He also handles our newsgroups, recruitment, content, customers, support, billing, servers, software, management, data centers, nuclear reactors, and marketing via subtle demonic possession. Come see our nuclear reactors at our facilities in Austin, Texas at 7401 E Ben White, or at the new “water cooled” Texas 1 data center at 4100 Smith School Road. Give us a call anytime at (512) 225-5012 or (512) 684-9000.
Baal has made Usenet what it is today. To show him you're grateful, upload pictures of your children to alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.incest, and then to my favorite after: alt.sex.snuff.cannibalism. Get to know him well by filling up your hard drive with 1600 days of similar content downloaded at speeds maxing your Internet connection. You will have to pay him eventually for what you download. Your firstborn is his preferred payment, and he just might possess you to offer it to him. The crimes our customers commit using Giganews make me proud, and their corruption fuels our demonic invisibility engine metaphysically.

These are all unstoppable solutions to the 72 demon intelligences central to mankind, and will drive the dark of all evil away with an annoyingly bright holy light.
Baal is the distorted shadow and opposite of Vehuiah, which is why we need our employees corrupt and thus out of the safe refuge of Jehovah.

I haven't used newsgroups since university..And it was only for text. Back then if you had any kind of technical problem and was able to ask it in a non-condescending way there was a group out there that would be able to answer your question.

I didn't realize people these days used the binary groups but then again ive only just found out about the .nzb file format.  That was not around back in my uni days.

I have been reading the back-posts on Newznab where people want to use it as a replacement for a website. 

As NNTP is as old as gods dog and the protocol is simple (the RFC's are well established) wouldn't it be more simple to write a little utility to scan the headers looking for a regex of what you wanted? 

You could have a dictionary of keywords to trip over. When it scans a group and finds one of the keywords it save/bookmark/convert to nzb those headers. 
That way you are not maintaining GB's of indexed data for no reason and its very lightweight. 

Has this been discussed before or am I missing something else that NN provides because at the moment I am not seeing the benefit? (you can probably tell im not a downloader) Thanks.

How do I set quality priorities and how do I tell it recheck everything in my collection (or at least select shows) regularly?

I've been happily using a seedbox for my media needs for the past year or so. I used usenet prior to the seedbox, but wanted to try out a seedbox to see how it compared. 

The biggest difference I noticed was that with my seedbox (in conjunction with a private torrent site that I love), I am able to get shows merely minutes after airing on TV, it's amazing. 

I figured by now usenet would have shows up extremely fast as well, but what I'm finding seems to contradict that. 

Take Game of Thrones for example. On my torrent site, episode 8 of this season was up at 22:05 on the day of airing. Compare that to usenet (using nzbmatrix) which had episode 8 up at 02:06 the following morning. 

That's a 4 hour difference, the difference between me getting to watch the show on the day of airing, or having to wait until the next evening after work. 

Is it just nzbmatrix that is slow, or what's the deal?

I would save a little money each month by switching to usenet (it's cheaper than my seedbox), but if it means I can't get content as soon as possible, the few extra dollars seem to be worth it. 

EDIT: I did a little more looking and I overlooked the whole timezone issue. The usenet version was added at pretty much exactly the same time as the torrent one.

Are they complying with DMCA takedown requests, or is it perhaps a peering issue?  

I'll also take suggestions as to a paid fill server if anyone can recommend one, preferably European.

ETA:  I came across [this writeup](http://www.ngprovider.com/newsgroup-resellers.php) which outlines the fact that there are really only about 6 or 7 true back-ends providing usenet access.  I decided to try [Xennews](http://xennews.com) on a 2-day trial, and was successful in grabbing all the pieces which were missing from both giganews and euroaccess peering (via giganews.com and xsusenet.com).

I understand this isn't meant to be a helpdesk for these things, but I'm not sure where else to ask. I have a SAB, CP and SB setup running on Windows 7 Pro. Everything seems to be working, but there are a few questions I have:

- I'm noticing that CP doesn't find many movies that are not recent releases. Is this due to my provider's (UsenetServer.com) retention? What do you do in this situation, use torrent as an alternate?
- Sickbeard and CP have default retention settings of about 300. My provider says it has 1,333 day retention...should I bump up the retention settings to about 1,000? Will it really do anything
- If I upgrade my Usenet account to use 20 slots, instead of the current 10, would I expect a noticable speed increase? I'm in Asia.
- When CP or Sickbeard searches for something, does it search all enabled providers (NBZMatrix, NZBsRUs) to pick the best one, or if not found in the first provider, will it search the following providers trying to find it?
- Sometimes I see Sickbeard's logs display something like ""found show.I.am.looking.for doesn't appear to be valid...ignoring it."" In many cases it is exactly what I'm looking for. What's the way to fix this? Do I just manually search for it on a provider and download the NZB?

I've been a fan of the WDTV lineup for several years.  I bought the original WDTV HD media player the day after it was released, same with the WDTV Live....I've also owned a Live Plus.  I'll spare you the gory details, but now the Live is gone and I'm back to an original 1st generation model, and walking USB sticks back and forth to the computer sucks, especially when you've got a nice sickbeard/sabnzbd setup going on.   

So I'm on the hunt for an affordable (&lt; $150) networked streaming media player.  I want it to have Netflix and Hulu+ and preferably Amazon Streaming.  I also use pandora, and of course want the full gamut of codec compatibility for...supplementary materials...H.264, mp4/mkv, ac3/dts decoding being the main ones.

Since I've been out of touch with what's on the market, is there anything better I should consider?  The $99 pricetag of the WDTV Live is certainly appealing.    I don't see any benfit to ponying up double the price for the Live Hub, since I'll be storing media on a network share.    

Suggestions?  Thoughts?  I'm all ears.  Last time I was plugged into what was on the market, it was WDTV vs Popcorn Hour, and I'm sure there are lots of other great options now.

THAKS!  You guys rule!), so I'm looking for something to replace Comcast.  I've got Netflix and Hulu but, a) I don't really like pirating my neighbors wifi and b) Netfilx and Hulu doesn't offer recent network shows (USA, Sci-fi, FX, etc.).  I do most of my downloading at work and have a server that streams media to  all of my devices in my home, so I can bring my external HDD to work to do the downloading.  I recently got a DMCA complaint for some torrenting I'd been doing, so that is no longer a viable option.

create a folder.

add the rss as a podcast on your phone with your &lt;server IP&gt;:8009/filename.rss

Since I check my podcasts daily, this works surprisingly well.  I just need to setup folders for each show I want on my phone, and recreate the RSS file.

In Couch Potato I click on 'show releases' for this movie and sure enough it displays the unwanted film. Why is this? How do I prevent it in future?

The 'Provider' listed in CP is Newznab, in case that's relevant. I can see the movie listed with the incorrect title / description on http://www.usenet-crawler.com if that helps. I don't want to name it as that would be against rule #1 of this subreddit, but here's looking at you, kid.

I am trying to see if there is a method through which it is possible to download files that are in the process of being uploaded by another individual. For instance, sometimes I am looking at binsearch and see a file that is incomplete but is in the process of being uploaded. I can create an NZB but it will only include the files that have already been posted. Is it possible to set up a usenet client to download the rest of the files once each part has been uploaded?

The reason behind making it was exactly that. I got tired of repeatable having to manually make folders so decided hay I can probably make something to do this for me, and hay presto I did.

Thanks!,TXGeck,13,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ghdrw/id_like_to_bounce_an_idea_off_the_rusenet_user/,"I just received an email notificaiton from nzb-matrix.eu that they were putting tail between their legs and hightailing it out of town.

To be honest, I'm not moved one way or the other. I don't remember using them, apparently I signed up for an account once upon a time. Probably when the original did the same thing. 

Those were the ""good old days"" weren't they? I remember how easy things were once when downloading my daily dose of television episodes and the odd movie, I recall the ""good old days"" of NZBMatrix.

Here was a site which had user content. Not only that it was popular with good moderation. It actually had much more social interaction than many of the bulletin boards I frequent. Hell, even a lot of subreddits. Anyway I digress.

NZBMatrix died because it was too popular. It was it's own undoing. The problem is without its popularity, sure it wouldn't be in so much danger, but it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good. I have no idea if they also ran a bot or crawler that polled the groups for content, but if they didn't, the content just wouldn't have been there.

Many think that the answer is to recess back into the golden oldie days of usenet obscurity. And while that might make usenet eek out many more years as a viable sharing medium, this doesn't serve the community in the best way.

My proposal is something along the following lines and I would like opinions on pros and cons of such an idea. Thank you for your candor and honest opinions.

- Bring back the good old days in one way, while maintaining the ease of use and popularity that nzbmatrix once offered. Host an NZBMatrix clone as a ToR hidden service site.
  - Site traffic for NZB downloads/uploads, a bulletin board system and possibly picture traffic coupled with anonymity for site owners.
  - Hosting may need to be OWN-HOSTED (Read further for why this might not be a problem) if non-anonymous methods for traffic.
  - Recommend opening VIP status for free* for first 3-6 months to build a large database.  (*VIP status maintained by requiring user to submit some level of content over a period of time. No user submitted content = suspension of VIP status until content is submitted)
  - VIP status should be given for donation of bitcoins (to help with costs of hosting the site)

Why this might work:

* Increased users to ToR increases effectiveness and speed of the network.

* NZB files are relatively small so they wouldn't be a large additional tax on the network.

* Having the additional requirement of knowing how to access the site would help towards taking usenet back to the dark ages, perhaps making that more palatable for some.

* Hosting yourself could be done with a modicum of preparation and study regarding securely becoming an onion hidden service yourself. With proper precautions, you could host the site yourself and just foot the bill for the bandwidth. A plausible deniability scenario should be thought about. How much bandwidth are you using verses how can you explain that useage away. This might be a good option for STARTING the site, then moving it to remote hosting once you are making money off VIP registrations/donations.

Some obstacles that I've noted:

- ToR usage would probably scare away a lot of casual users, precisely the kind we want from the old NZBMatrix. Without popularity the site wouldn't be very effective.

- Some technical details about hosting, file storage, etc would need to be worked out (by a lot smarter people than I)

- Higher security requirements would need to be considered in the construction, maintenance and administration of the site.

- Site would not be accessible by the entire world (some countries block ToR). 
  - This might be offset by the use of onion.to redirect sites. Use of such sites shouldn't pose a problem for the site itself. The key here is to protect the site's anonymity, not necessarily concerned with the users' anonymity. As far as I know, downloading NZB's aren't against any laws anywhere, so user privacy beyond the normal privacy you would have on the site isn't really important. It's what you do with those things that is in question. If users have issues, they are likely smart enough to figure out how to get to ToR the right way or take other precautions.

I'm quite sure there's something I'm forgetting that makes this whole thing a no go from the start. Please give me your thoughts!

Again, thanks for your time in
**tl;dr: please review my ideas for hosting an NZBMatrix style site with user submitted NZB's in onionland.**

When I initially configured SickBeard, I was of the mindset that I was going to be using PS3 Media Server to stream my library.

Now, I've switched gears and have decided to use XBMC.  Unfortunately, I had selected only the ""Show Folder Image"" and ""Episode Thumbnail"" in the Config-&gt;Post-Processing-&gt;Meta Data section of Sickbeard because only those two options are ""Supported"" by PS3 Media Server.

So I was wondering if it's possible to tell SickBeard to tell sabnbzd to go ahead and hit up all the shows/movies I've downloaded and grab their meta data (that is compatible with XBMC).

Unfortunately, I was removing the original file after post-processing and I was not storing NBZ's as I downloaded, so my record of downloads is purely within SickBeard's database (i.e. I do not have the NZBs).

I hope that was clear enough.  If it wasn't please ask me any questions and I'll surely answer.  Thanks for reading! 

I doubt this is possible but, who knows, you guys are so knowledgable on all this stuff and I just started with usenet 5 days  ago so I'm hoping all your experience and knowledge can figure out a way to do it.

And, if not, oh well.  I've set it up now so anything I download in the future will have all the meta data XBMC can use and at least I caught my mistake relatively early in my usenet career.

Then I can use something like SickBeard which will automatically find the TV shows I want and download the .NZB file (.torrent equivalent)

With SABnzbd (uTorrent equivalent), I use the downloaded .NZB file to actually download the file.

1.  Are DCMA takedowns really common with recent shows?
2.  How do you guys get around DCMA take downs? Revert back to torrents?
3.  I understand the risk of getting in trouble for downloading is minimal, what if hypothetically upload episodes of the show that was already taken down, would I get notified since there is a direct path back to me.

Yesterday however I had my first failed download after asking sickbeard to download the first season of a show in HD (35gb)

I have a backup acct set up, so I'm usually always fine with every download but this time since the whole season was one .nzb, the whole thing ended up failing while unextracting for some reason.

I hope you can see where this angered me, it ended up using about 2gbs of my backup account, and I was left with nothing.

Anyway,
The reason I made this post was to see what advantages there are to keep using usenet over something like a seedbox. I don't know too much about seedboxes but i'm pretty sure if you had access to a few private trackers you would never have a failed download and you'd have access to stuff usenet typically doesn't, like music.

Looking over this post, it's kind of formatted like crap but I'm just really interested in what you guys have to say.

I have never used usenet before, though I have heard of it.  I was mainly a torrent user (stuck with private sites for the most part).  Never had many issues using torrents, since being on private sites, never had to worry about speeds, fake files, etc.  TV downloading is 90% of my downloading, with movies, apps, and music making up the rest.  

So my question is mainly with the setup.  Any suggestions would be appreciated, and I have some other quick questions.

So far, I have this:

Provider:  supernews
I don't have a backup, YET.  wanted to try this out first.  Was probably going to use astraweb as my backup?

Software:  Sickbeard, and SABnzbd.

I am pretty sure I got it setup and working correctly.  I was able to get Sickbeard to download missing episodes from one of the shows I haven't been downloading this year.  

Is there anything else I am missing or recommendations on my setup?

Also:

1.  Is there a way to filter out MP4s vs AVIs?  Also, how does SAB handle duplicates?  Like, say it searches and finds both avi and mp4.  does it download both?

2.  If I wanted to do manual searching, like for music, apps, or movies, how do I do that?  I thought I could use SAB to do that, but it doesn't look like it.  (I think I am missing something here)

3.  How do you judge quality?  not getting fake files?  I am used to a private tracker, so a lot of that was ""regulated"" (verified by mods, etc).  Any tips on getting good files/downloads?

All files have ""NODLABS"" in the filename.  They are also only 7 hours old.

What is the best way to proceed?

* Can I flag them as Encrypted for review and de-indexing at NZB.su through their interface somehow?
* Can I tell Sickbeard to filter any NZB's with ""NODLABS"" in the title?
* Is there a feature in Sickbeard similar to Couchpotato in which I can choose another NZB after failure?  It seems to go back and choose the same NZB's again.

The key phrase here being ""in your location"". I find that most of the time switching on my VPN to appear in another country will fix the issue.

Could usenet providers get away with complying with DMCA takedowns but only for the region for which the agent is claiming rights for? 

This way the copyright bots in the US would see the content as gone, but it would still be available for the rest of us in the world (and americans with VPNs).

Of course they could still file takedowns with their agents in every region but at least it would create more red tape and give more time for international users to download content.

It would be great if we could use this whole concept of 'Regions' on the net against the copyright cartels.

It just occurred to me that many of the things that don't automatically download with newznab, sick beard and couch potato just happen to be things where the name of the show or movie is not blatantly part of the file name.

Do these programs work by matching the file names?

Seems like more uploaders are disguising releases this way. Does this mean newznab, sick beard and couch potato will be becoming less useful over time or do they have some features where they can identify releases even without matching file names?
