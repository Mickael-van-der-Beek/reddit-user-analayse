I got the train from Queen Street Station to Balloch and walked up the East side of the loch for about 30mins. There's a path for most of the way for walkers and tourists to enjoy the loch, but then the path and the loch side separate into two different directions.

As soon as the path is finished the place becomes a midden. I am not exaggerating. What a shit hole.

I think its the buckfast brigade from Glasgow that camp overnight with their cerry oot. Whoever it is is probably fishing too. They leave all their empty lager cans everywhere, burn plastic shit, dump their rubbish and disappear. Empty alcohol containers are the biggest problem. At one point I found 24 empty Somerfield's own cans of lager lying beside a tree, so they must have been there for a while.

There was a shopping trolley left there. A fuckin shopping trolley. How and why the fuck they manage to get a trolley there is beyond me, it must have been a pain in the arse.

I had three polly bags with me that I filled to capacity and took them with me to a bin, but I might as well have not bothered. 

What does it say for us if tourists are coming and our National Parks are left in such a mess? It's not even as if it'd be hard for someone to pick it all up.

My order was well over £100, but then I got an e-mail saying they had to charge me an extra £6 to ship to Edinburgh, Scotland. I'm a newbie to the UK so just wondering if this is normal?

Update: Called them out on it, response was that they always charge for Scotland (which was further down the page on their delivery rates). Called them out again saying it was false advertising, response was that she would speak to the manager and give me 10% off my NEXT order and not charge for shipping on that NEXT order. Still no refund for the shipping on this order, which was charged to my card without authorization. Problem is they shipped it before authorizing my card so if I want to return it based on this I'll have to pay £9 to return it to them.

I just had this idea of writing down a list of things that I've learnt so far. I know there's a lot of things I've missed out and if you can think of any other tips feel free to contribute in the comments. I want to say I love Scotland and I don't mean to offend anyone, it's just my personal view on some things. Also, I live in the West Lothian area, so some of the things are not representative of the rest of the country.

----- 

Weather
 
1. You have to accept that you will be cold when outside at least 70% of the time.

2. The trick for dressing properly is: light internal layers for when inside buildings (cause it’s usually warm everywhere you go), heavy/multiple coats/jackets for when outside.

3. Always carry some sort of rain protection, like a small umbrella or a hat. Personally and following what seems to be the trend, hoodies are the best for this effect.

Smoking

4. If you smoke, be prepared to have to stand in the cold outside for your cigarette. They are very anti-smoking in the UK.

5. Cigarettes are expensive. Be prepared to cut down or start rolling your own cigarettes. And Lucky Strikes are hard to get.

Food

6. If it has haggis in it, it tastes good. Doesn’t matter if it’s proper haggis, fake haggis, cheap haggis, veggie haggis, all the kinds that I’ve tried so far were good.

7.	It can be a challenge finding good ingredients for homemade food. Especially if you don’t have access to a big supermarket.

8.	The good part is, there are loads of options of pre-made stuff you can just cook in the oven/microwave and they can be quite good and sometimes even healthy. Choose wisely.
9.	Take-aways are a temptation. Some can be cheap and there are so many options that you feel tempted to do it every night. But it’s not as cheap as it looks and you get the risk of food poisoning. Learning which take-away does the good pizzas, which does the good burgers AND which doesn’t give you diarrhea can be a challenge. Mastering the art of the take-away is something that comes with time.
10.	There are a lot of fried things. Like a deep fried Mars bar. I tend to avoid them to be honest, but it’s just my preference.
11.	I have never seen so many options of sweets and chocolates before. Even the smallest shop will have a wide collection. Be careful with that. And chips. Everyone has chips as a snack.

Socializing

12.	Most people in shops and services are lovely and friendly. Usually very helpful as well. Except if you go to the jobcenter, they can be cunts there.
13.	Speaking of cunts, you’ll start to swear more. There’s nothing you can do. Everyone swears if they are in an informal situation. Just embrace the marvelous art of Scottish swearing, they come up with stuff that doesn’t even make sense but it’s somehow very insulting.
14.	The banter. The way friends socialize it’s pretty much by insulting each other, telling embarrassing stories and proving your manliness. It’s all good though, you can judge how close you are to your mates by how much hassle you get from them.
15.	The accent. It can be tricky. Sometimes you get a taxi driver from Glasgow and can’t understand a word they’re saying. Sometimes you’re in a group of people talking very fast at the same time and you can’t keep up with it. It’s alright. It gets better in time. Pro-tip: alcohol helps understanding it better.

Traditional stuff

16.	Kilts are usually worn only in special occasions like weddings. Most men don’t know how to behave while wearing them and sit with their legs open and such. Best option: avoid looking at that area.
17.	Bagpipes are awesome if played correctly. However, most pipers you get on the streets will play the same tune for hours and will play it badly. Also I’ve found out that you can be miles away from the piper and still hear the screeching noises. Learn to ignore it.
18.	You will want to buy all the random stuff they sell for tourists but trust me, some of the best gifts are not so obvious. A good woolen scarf, a tin of shortbread or a miniature Highland coo make the best gifts.

Alcohol

19.	All alcohol is expensive and you can’t drink outside or buy alcohol after 10pm. You’ll learn to cope with this.
20.	Cocktails and drinks with vodka and such are really expensive at pubs. Learn to enjoy beer. 
21.	However, they have loads of different beers to choose from, and usually every pub will have a good selection. Don’t forget that they drink in pints. And they drink them pretty fast as well, so expect to get very drunk without realizing it.
22.	I have never seen anyone getting drunk on whisky here. It is usually expensive as well. Buckfast is apparently the national drink, which is a fortified wine with caffeine or something. Like an energy drink with alcohol. It gets you fucked from what I’ve heard. I still have to try it properly.
23.	When everyone is drunk and talking really loud and going too far, learn to not taking it too seriously. This is important.

Beverages

24.	You will become a tea drinker. Some will become tea addicts. A few will become tea experts. Personally, I like my tea with a splash of milk, and the stronger the better. Tea is good at all times. Everyone likes tea. Make sure you never run out of teabags and milk.
25.	Coffee is not very good. You get the lattes and those big coffee things but a good espresso is hard to find. And good tasting coffee can be expensive as well. The answer? See previous tip.
26.	Irn Bru. I can try to explain it. It’s a fizzy drink, and like coca-cola it has its own taste. It’s bright orange and when you drink it you know it is bad for you. You can taste it. I didn’t like it that much the first few times I tried it, but right now it’s one of my favourite non alcoholic drinks.

TV

27. TV is shite just like everywhere else in the world. Reality shows and soap operas and game shows.  
28. The adverts are terrible. It’s either some stop-motion thing with songs or puppets talking or really irritating tunes.
29.	The best thing is comedy. You can catch some good comedy stuff, a few good comedians, a few good series etc.

And the final tip…

Enjoy Scotland because it is an amazing country, the culture and tradition are awesome and it is so beautiful. But the best part is the people and how everyone tries to make you feel included and part of this.

Start at the bottom of the Royal Mile and gather as many free leaflets as you can. Move your way up and as you find yourself surrounded start handing out the leaflets. People will immediately treat you like a chugger and do anything to avoid you, thus freeing your passage. It also helps if, like me you have a pink mohican as people think you will spontaneously juggle fire.

The Orange Walk - over 300 years of celebrating a battle in which those walking, and those watching know almost NOTHING of the battle fought, what was involved, the true religious leanings of William and his army, or the possibility that he was gay. I'm sure to you this last point would be something very uncomfortable for your little brains to deal with because the only thing worse than the Catholics is of course the gays and paedos which you group alongside each other. Also it's funny that it is such a celebration of ""Britishness"" because you know...HE WAS FUCKING DUTCH!

Nice to see there's plenty of hypocritical, closet-bigot MORONS who want to celebrate division of the peoples of the world. Besides, the difference between Catholics and Protestants is almost moot. You've got a few less daft traditions and that's about it.

How many of you go to church?

Do you celebrate the Battle of Vienna which essentially halted for good the Muslim invasion of Europe?

What about the liberation of Spain from Muslim rule?

What about victories in the Crusades? An equally large waste of time, lives and resources.

Those people have FAR larger differences than you do (and even then it's not much at all) and yet they're the ones who own the curry houses and takeaways you jump into after your almost Orwellian day of hate.


Do you attack orthodox Christians too?

Why the fuck not?

You hypocritical, repulsive, stupid, intellectually devoid, laughable, ignorant human beings. You are a waste of oxygen and nutrients. Get out of my fucking country and back to the 17th century. Then kill yourself by the sword or cutting yourselves shaving and dying of infection.

*""Proud in our individual identities - but working together for a common good.*

*""We saw it when our soldiers fought together under one flag on the beaches of Normandy.*

*""We saw it when our doctors came together to build our NHS.*

*""We saw it in the scientific breakthroughs that we made together: from the television to penicillin.*

*""And we saw it last summer as athletes from around Britain - no matter where they were from - draped themselves in one flag.""*

So David Cameron says we should stay together because...

We fought together on the beaches of Normandy...

Well besides the fact that this happened almost 70 years ago we were also fighting alongside and together with soldiers from the United States, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Poland.

We built the NHS together...

The NHS has already been devolved to us and we have shown that not only can we run it better on our own we are also running in the way it was originally intended to be run. He on the other hand is currently dismantling and privatising his own NHS down in England.

We made scientific breakthroughs together such as television and penicillin...

We? Television and Penicillin were invented by Scots.

And because athletes from around Britain competed last year under the one flag...

So what? Next year athletes from around Britain are competing again except this time against each other and under our own flags.

David Cameron's arguments for the union are just meaningless and condescending platitudes coming from a person who is running this country into the ground, making the poor poorer, the rich richer and the worst of it is that Scotland never even voted for him or his party. 

David Cameron is the current version of a long line of people that Scotland has had doing things to us and our country that we usually disagree with.

If that's the case then why on earth would anyone decide to agree with him over our country's future next year and give him exactly what he wants next year?

Vote ""no"" next year if you want us condemned to a future under David Cameron followed by others exactly like him.

It seems that anything Scottish, or displays of any sort of affection or national pride for Scotland, is now being posited as being 'pro independence'. If you choose to fly the Saltire, then you're automatically seen as a 'separatist'. If you say you feel more Scottish than British, you're a raving nationalist. 

I myself am pro-independence, but I fear that this association that is blithely being made between any type of display of Scottish identity and independence could well be damaging for all of us - whether out of a suppression of our culture as a result (out of fear of being painted as a 'nationalist', or shame if the vote goes the way of the no camp.

Now that I'm back in America, it's such a bummer. EVERYTHING tasted better in Scotland. 

Note for future travelers: Perhaps save Arthur's Seat for the END of your trip, rather than the beginning.


**EDIT**

As requested, I'll do a ""brief"" outline of how we spent our time! A side note though, we didn't travel too far away from Edinburgh because we definitely were too nervous about driving and didn't want to spend hours on buses/trains, etc. We really want to go back to check out more one day! Also, we're super big on food (and find it a fun challenge since I mostly eat vegan, though very rarely I'll eat fish) and castles, so that's basically what we focused on.

So, we were there for 9 days, and 8 nights.

Day 1: Landed, checked in, etc., walked around Edinburgh to get a feel of the city, what we might want to check out that we didn't hear about and all that jazz. We got lunch at Omar Khayyam on Grosbenor Street, and while it wasn't necessarily Scottish, it was a great introduction to the level of food we were going to eat for the rest of the week. The only complaint we really had was Miso Sushi on Haymarket Terrace that we got for dinner that night. My SO got sushi, which was a lovely shade of grey and I got an inedible ""thai"" dish.

Day 2: Our most loaded day, by accident. We went to Edinburgh Castle, and finished much earlier in the day than expected, so we decided to tour Holyrood Palace, and also finished that up by early afternoon... so we decided to head up Arthur's Seat. Arthur's Seat killed our legs for the rest of the week, and it was miserable ascent because we didn't realize we only had a sip of water between us left until it was too late. All in all, those places were beautiful/fantastic and educational. For lunch we went to Kilberkin Pub on the Royal Mile (prior to Holyrood and Arthur's seat). That evening we got takeaway pizza at the Concorde across from Cameo Cinema. Now, it might have been that we were starving after all the walking we had done, but it was pretty good pizza as far as ""fast food"" can be concerned. We ended the night at Cameo, viewing The Word's End. 

Day 3: We took a train to North Berwick and then headed off to Tantallon Castle. For lunch we got an amazing dish called ""Fish on Fire"" at County Bar Hotel Restaurant on High Street. It was so fresh! For dinner, we got takeaway from Henderson's (back in Edinburgh) on Hanover Street. 

Day 4: It was really rainy, so we spent most of the day in the National Museum of Scotland. Once it cleared up we explored Calton Hill, and then St. Anthoy's Chapel (ruins near Arthur's Seat) and Dunsapie Fort (I think it's called). We happened upon the Elephant House on George IV Bridge, and being obsessed with Harry Potter, we had to eat there for lunch. For dinner, we went to Circus Cafe on St. Mary's Street. Holy cow their vegan chocolate cake was incredible! That night we decided to go on the Auld Reekie Tour (a ghost tour). I can't remember our guide's name, but he was an older man and very funny/informed.

Day 5: We explored Leith, then headed over to Lauriston Castle, and then Edinburgh. We got lunch in Leith at Ship on the Shore on The Shore Road, which was pretty good, but maybe not as amazing as we were hoping. For dinner we happened upon The Hub cafe on Castlehill. Although the food was good, this one particular bagpiper was perhaps not the most talented... so we tried to finish quickly.

Day 6: Cragmillar Castle and exploring Edinburgh again. For lunch we found ORB Raw Vegan Cafe on Morrison Street (OMG AMAZING), and then for dinner we chose The Black Rose Tavern on Rose Street.

Day 7: Linlithgow Castle, Linlithgow, Dean Village in Edinburgh, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. I loved that the our tour guides for Linlithgow Castle were somewhere between 8 and 12 years old. Adorable! For lunch we stopped in at The Four Marys on High Street in Linlithgow, and for a treat we went to Oliphant Bakers down the road. For dinner, we went back to Rose Street and chose the Mussel Inn.

Day 8: Dirleton Castle, Gullane (and their beach!), and then spent the night saying goodbye to the wonderful city of Edinburgh. For lunch we went to the Gulf Inn on Main Street in Gullane. My favorite meal happened to be our last one, David Bann on St. Mary's Street. I will forever miss the food I had that night and am devastated there's nothing like that were I live.

Day 9: Traveled home :( Got mediocre sushi at Heathrow Airport.

Everyone we met and talked to were very friendly and helpful. By helpful I mean, we're inexperienced travelers and needed a lot of help finding out how to get the places we wanted to go to. The food service was always excellent, even if the food wasn't always out of this world. On our last night, while we were walking home, I was playing with my SO and saying that I didn't want to leave, we should stay, etc., and a man who was walking next to us said that he thought the same thing five years ago and never left (I think he was from London). The sites were beautiful, our accommodations by the Fountain Court apartments was as lovely as expected, and the food was generally very excellent. And for anyone wondering, we made breakfast in our apartment every morning.

If you are here or know anyone up here for the festival, and could send them my way, I would be very grateful. 

One show is called Dachau Guide. It's a spoken word piece: I was already a tour guide, and I didn't want to be a guide at a Holocaust memorial. Then I took my racist little brother to the Dachau memorial and everything changed, a piece less about the camp and more about the people who work there.

The other show is called ""Doom! the Musical! Sing All the Things!"" It's a one hour musical show of songs based on themes coincidentally common to Reddit. If you like Reddit because you are filthy and or immature, then this show is for you.

I recommend that you do the same yourself and especially read through the ones on /r/ukpolitics and compare them to the ones here on /r/Scotland.

The difference in the sort of comments that are being posted and where the upvotes go in the various threads is to me a demonstration of how dramatically different Scotland's politics and social attitudes are now from the rest of the UK, especially England.

Does this suggest that Scotland is now so politically different to the rest of the UK that we should most certainly seize our opportunity to go it alone next year?

If we do then we know that at the very least we will forever more always be run by governments that the Scottish people have voted for.

Or if we decide to remain in the union next year with the rest of the UK how exactly is that going to be a good thing for our future when the political attitudes are like chalk and cheese? 

Why is being in a union with a majority of people who will more often than not deliver a government in Westminster that the majority of us hate a good thing for Scotland's future?

Here's three of my reasons:

* The whole ""there will be lots of oil money argument"". Yes oil prices will only go up but I don't think there is enough left to find in the North Sea to exploit this for much longer. I study geology at university and from the predictions given by companies when they visit and give presentations are very pessimistic about what's left down there. Also, has anybody worked out what an independent Scotland's territorial waters will be?

* ""Keeping the pound as currency"". Why? If the objective is independence doesn't that mean we split all political ties with the UK? If the pound is kept doesn't that give the Bank of England (and to some extent Westminster) control over fiscal policy? Surely an independent currency or the Euro would be a better option.

* The Donald Trump Saga. The way the Scottish government (particularly the SNP) went about that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I'm happy with devolution and the system that's currently in place (obviously I'm not happy about UK Conservative policy, but then who is?) and I feel well represented at a Scottish and UK level. Please feel free to disabuse me of some of my opinions but can we keep the insults and unpleasantness to a minimum.

The American, being intrigued, asked a priest who was strolling by what the telephone was used for.

The priest replied that it was a direct line to heaven and that for £10,000 you could talk to God.

The American thanked the priest and went along his way.

Next stop was in Lincoln
There, at the cathedral, he saw the same golden telephone with the same sign under it.

He wondered if this was the same kind of telephone he saw in London and he asked a nearby nun what its purpose was.

She told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for £10,000 he could talk to God.

'O.K., thank you,' said the American.

He then travelled to York , Durham and Liverpool

In every Cathedral he saw the same golden telephone with the same '£10,000 per call' sign under it.

The American, upon leaving the N of England decided to travel to Scotland to see if the Scots had the same phone.

He arrived in Glasgow, and again, as he entered the cathedral , there was the same golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read '50 pence per call.'

The American was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign. 'Reverend, I've travelled all over England and I've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. I'm told that it is a direct line to heaven, but in England the price was £10,000 per call. Why is it only 50pence here?'

The priest smiled and answered, 'You're in Scotland now, son .... it's a local call.'",,False,,t5_2qkli,False,,,True,t3_nv2j8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/nv2j8/fwd_fwdfwd_hilarious_lol/,

But I flew into Glasgow and visited some street called Bath Street for a few hours.. It had a good amount of pubs and what not.. Living in America my whole life and having Scottish heritage and always reading about the history I had the time of my life for the few hours I spent there. (Just being there made me happy to be honest)

A few notes about my trip...

1) Never even knew the beer Tennents existed lol
2) The locals were more than friendly even though it seemed like a touristy place..
3) A girl did ask me for the time and I couldn't understand what she was saying because of the accent lol. ( she had to ask me at least 4 times)
4) I forgot how far north you guys all are because it gets dark so late.
5) I want to move there
6) Belhavens is my new favorite beer! (Idk if i spelled belhavens right)

1349881075.0,33,self.Scotland,1195j1,After reaching the front page there's a few misconceptions I'd like to address about independence,TheMasque,41,8,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1195j1/after_reaching_the_front_page_theres_a_few/,"The main problem with the independence debate is that most people have already chosen sides, many of them are motivated by emotions rather than logic and many of them are using debating tactics and points that are relatively out-dated.

1) Everyone talks about the North Sea Oil, and this is not a good idea for 2 reasons.

Pro-independence people say the North Sea Oil would afloat our economy giving us the boost we need to compete on the international stage

Anti-independence people say that it is about to run out in 2020 and may not even belong to Scotland anyway.

This Anti-independence people are right about the former, and potentially right about the latter.

What everyone doesn't realize is that Alex Salmond, who's primary education is in economics, does not imagine that the North Sea Oil will be even our primary export. He is attempting to create a country that can sell energy burned from fossil fuels whilst fueling our own country with renewable energy.

He's also started the creative and innovative Scotland intiatives which seek to promote Scotlands leading role (and it is a leading role) in various sciences such as aeronautics, engineering and the social sciences. The investment in education that SNP believes in will turn us all into skill professionals who will be given many projects throughout the world.



2), in tackling the misconceptions about the Barnett formula, it is essentially true that we get £1,300ish per-head more than the rest of the UK per-head. But this is not some kind of glaring inequality. It is actually a perfectly equitable investment. We recieve this money from GB because we actually MAKE much more money per-head than any other country in the UK.  Asides from in London there are more millionaires in Glasgow and Edinburgh than anywhere else in the UK.



Edit: What people need to understand as well is that the economic and financial arguments around independence are actually only part of what is going on. In Scotland, the Tory party is essentially vanishing, their votes decreasing exponentially each term (with a few exceptions), however, they're only getting more powerful in England. Scotland has also always been virulently opposed to many of the things that Britain as a whole are, like the Iraq war, and yet we are still culpable in the undemocratic actions of the UK government.

Furthermore, Alex Salmond wants to get away from the world of adversarial politics. In Westminster, it is just a boys club where the issue is no longer important. Everyone is motivated by self-interest just trying to discredit the other party in the hope of them stealing their supporters. This is a selfish perversion of what democracy is all about. Holyrood has never been like that, and has become even more efficient and democratic in decision making ever since Alex Salmond came into power. If you've ever actually watched the debates there (as I have), then you can see that when the other parties attack big Alex his response is always ""This is a policy your party supported. Now that I have implemented it you are attacking me. I see this as essentially irrelevant"".

Alex Salmond is not adversarial, and not self-motivated either. He is a Nationalist. He loves our beautiful country and its people and he does not want to glorify himself (although that would be a product of him achieving his dream), he simply wants Scottish people to be able to talk and decide upon the issues as they wish.


So yes, the critics are right that the movement is largely ideological....but those ideals are incredibly important. How long do you want to live under the thumb of a government that is on the other end of the spectrum for your country? How long are you willing to let people sit and talk about the issues whilst there's a perfectly good candidate ready to actually CONFRONT them?",,False,,t5_2qkli,1349882024.0,,,True,t3_1195j1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1195j1/after_reaching_the_front_page_theres_a_few/,

For clarity, I used Scotland's [eight electoral regions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Regions2011.png) for this one. I think that might have sparked confusion; for instance, Dundee is part of ""North East Scotland"", and ""West Scotland"" is actually a tiny area immediately to the west of Glasgow. I let people opt out of answering this as a result of the confusion, but some people might have been a bit cocky, so be aware of potential skews here.

**Should Scotland be an independent country?**

77% (61 respondents) said Yes.

The letter is quite personal and the content concerns his parents and family. It seems to have been written in 1986, when James, or Jamie as the letter refers to him, was 5 years old; however, it looks like it was intended for him to read when he was much older.

If you are, or you think you may know James/Jamie, and you/he were born on the 5th of October 1981, PM me, and confirm your surname (or James' surname), and I can either scan and email you the letter, or I can meet and give it to you/him.

Slim chance of finding him on Reddit, but if it was meant for me, I'd want it back, and not lying around for anyone to read.

I hold her accountable for the aspirational money grabbing society  in which we find ourselves where all that matters is the next pound and then the next. It is in the political landscape of her aftermath that we find ourselves choosing from an amorphous Who's who of milk-sop right centrist nobodies vying for our complicity. 
In her lifetime she crushed the state, crippled industry and fought tirelessly for 'I' over 'we'.  Her contribution to our nation was a dereliction  of the work of a generation of post war politicians who worked slavishly to build from a war ravaged nation a bastion of social democracy where those who could not protect themselves need not go unprotected. And now to reward her ruthless  and unceasing crusade against the state she will be Sent to rest in a doubtless elaborate albeit painfully ironic state funeral funded by £9m straight from the pocket of the taxpayer. And  so i bid happy farewell and good riddance, not to her as a human life; not as another sentient painfeeling entity within our vast universe, but to a memory, a bad aftertaste a lingering foulness. May she rest in peace the like of which those of us here present may never know in the wake of the world which she has entrusted to us.

So the neighbours are giving him grief about it, and the other night while he was out walking someone took a pot shot at him. As he had his headphones in he never heard anything but felt the sharp pain in his leg and instantly knew he'd been hit, since he couldn't see what it was, he has to assume it was an airgun as nothing penetrated but left an enormous lump. 
He is a seriously big guy so hard to miss, and of course no one likes dog mess, but surely you should cut a guy a break. Guide dogs are trained to go at home, but if you live in an apartment you are forced to use public space.

&gt;Around 4pm this evening I took the attached photo of my 4 year old daughter looking cute on the back of a vespa seat at an ice cream bar inside Braehead shopping centre in the middle of a shopping trip. Having just bought her some new jigsaws we were going to go look at some clothes shops but never managed to continue our shopping trip.
&gt;
&gt;Walking down the shopping mall a man approached me from behind as I was carrying my daughter in my arms. He came from behind me, cutting in front of me and told me to stop. That was quite a shock as I am wary of people with crew cuts and white shirts suddenly appearing in front of me, but then realised he was a security guard.
&gt;
&gt;He then said I had been spotted taking photos in the shopping centre which was 'illegal' and not allowed and then asked me to delete any photos I had taken. I explained I had taken 2 photos of my daughter eating ice cream and that she was the only person in the photo so didn't see any problem. i also said that I wasn't that willing to delete the photo's and there seemed little point as I had actually uploaded them to facebook.
&gt;
&gt;He then said i would have to stay right where I was while he called the police, which seemed as little extreme. My daughter was crying by this stage, but I said that was fine I would wait and began to comfort my daughter who was saying she didn't like the man and wanted to go. After about 5 minutes two police officers arrived.
&gt;
&gt;The older police officer was actually quite intimidating in his nature. He said that there had been a complaint about me taking photos and that there were clear signs in Braehead shopping centre saying that no photographs were allowed. I tried to explain that I hadn't seen any clearly displayed signs and that I had taken 2 photos of my daughter.
&gt;
&gt;As i was trying to explain he said I was interrupting him and that I should remain quiet until he had finished speaking to me. Not wanting to distress my daughter further, and to allow him to finish I let him continue. At one stage i was reassuring my daughter that everything was okay, only to be told I wasn't listening by the officer.
&gt;
&gt;Once he had finished, i then started to explain again my situation, only for the officer to start speaking again. Apparently different rules of respect apply when someone other than a police officer is speaking. I explained that that far from being aggressive when the security guard came over, the way he approached me was threatening and intimidating. I was told that was my word against his. Although this didn't seem to be the case when the security guard alleged that I was threatening when I had a 4 year old in my arms and waited patiently for the police to arrive.
&gt;
&gt;The police officer than started to say that there were privacy issues around photographs, to which I said yes and in a busy shopping centre I waited until only my daughter was in the shot. I explained that I was happy to show him the photos although not sure under what authority he could ask me to delete the photos. 
&gt;
&gt;He then said that under the Prevention of Terrorism Act he was quite within in his rights to confiscate my mobile phone without any explanation for taking photos within a public shopping centre, which seems an abuse of the act. He then said on this occasion he would allow me to keep the photos, but he wanted to take my full details.
&gt;
&gt;Name, place of birth, age, employment status, address. Had I not had my daughter with me, and the fact that we are trying to bring our daughter up to respect and trust police officers, I may have exercised my right not to provide those details. My view is that up until that stage the police were using powers their stop and account powers. I had done that so would have been within my rights not to give further details, however I chose to give the details.
&gt;
&gt;The police officer also said that the security guard was within his rights to now ask me to leave Braehead Shopping Centre and bar me from the premises which I was happy to oblige.
&gt;
&gt;Four things that are truly ridiculous the whole photo situation. How many people have taken photos of their children in Build-a-bear or on rides and attractions in Braehead? The police officer even thinking of making reference to the Prevention of Terrorism Act; wondering how many shoplifters got away while my act of terrorism was being dealt with; and the fact that i was clearly shopping and intended to continue shopping at a time when retail sales are at there lowest for over a decade. I guess Braehead shopping centre must be bucking the trend!
&gt;
&gt;I am quite happy to be contacted further regarding this story, and happy for the story to be published. My contact details are **REMOVED FROM ORIGINAL**. Although not sure whether Braehead would allow a photocall in the shopping centre.

**TL;DR Father takes a photo of his daughter eating ice cream in a Scottish shopping centre; is aggresively asked by security, then police, to remove all pictures taken under the Prevention of Terrorism Act; is told to leave and could be barred from re-entering.**

A[ similar story is told of Aberdeen's Union Square shopping centre](http://otheraberdeen.blogspot.com/2010/12/private-enterprise-petit-police.html), from December 2010.

I consider myself a socialist and I used to vote Labour before switching to the SNP in 2011 because I thought they did a good job since 2007. The SNP seems to be the only buffer between us and extended privatisation, crazy PFI schemes and new nuclear power plants.

Every day I read stories about the disgusting attacks on the disabled and unemployed. Why do Scots who aren't tories want Scotland to be subjected to this ideological madness? Do they really want Scotland to get dragged down too? As I see it, the whole UK political axis has shifted to suit the NeoCon agenda.

I bought a couple of tickets for the Jacobite train, but now I'm wondering if that's also a tourist trap and whether I should get a refund. :/ 

(Perhaps I should mention that my primary objectives in Scotland are to enjoy the major cities, hike the Highlands, and sample lots of whisky and great food. Sadly, Islay is a bit out of the way of our itinerary, so we'll have to go there on a future trip.)

We're incredibly excited for the trip! But I do hate ending up in tourist traps, and I feel like locals always know which ones to avoid (i.e. they would never go there on their own for fun). (By the way if you ever visit San Francisco where I live, don't go to Fisherman's Wharf. Go to the Mission instead. But I digress...)

Looking outside at the bus stop signs doesn't work really well unless you are sitting on the left side and upstairs (in the city).
Of course the buses will not necessarily stop anywhere in between so you really have to know where you are somehow.

The buses even do have screens that could easily display that sort of information (next bus stops) but instead they just show the feeds of the ubiquitous CCTVs ...

I don't get it. Also why are the frickin bus stops (at least in and around Edinburgh) so damn close together? I just don't see the use in bus stops being so close together that I can walk from one to the next faster than the bus goes. It's surreal how damn long it takes to get anywhere via bus in Edinburgh.

Anyway... to get to the point... 'The iQons', a great Glasgow based rock band got in touch and were perfect for what we wanted to do.

Here's what we delivered. - https://vimeo.com/59050287

Big thanks to both /r/Scotland and the iQons - https://www.facebook.com/theiqonsband

Cheers for the positive replies! In answer to the questions about the audio recording... as far as a i know the band did it all the production themselves - check out their facebook page.. i think its got a lot more about how they do it all on there! 

Also.... if anyone is in a band or knows a band looking for a vid... dinna be shy in getting in touch :d

1369870666.0,23,self.Scotland,1favxq,Culturally significant Scottish television?,daeedorian,27,4,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1favxq/culturally_significant_scottish_television/,"Greetings all,

I'm an American planning a visit to Scotland later this year, and I'm quite interested in learning about contemporary Scottish culture in the meantime. As a media buff, I'm especially interested in films or television series that are representative of or significant to Scottish culture.

I've already seen the first few seasons of *Monarch of the Glen*, which was soapy, and obviously something of an idealized caricature of Scottish culture, but I still enjoyed it until actors started leaving and the plotting went to hell.

I've also been watching *Gary: Tank Commander,* which is really quite hilarious.

*Case Histories* is a pretty slick detective drama, but it feels like it may as well take place anywhere else in the UK. The fact that it takes place in Edinburgh doesn't seem very relevant to the show.

That said, I was hoping to get some good recommendations for films or TV series that are entertaining while also being quintessentially Scottish in nature and/or content.

Many thanks!

Edit: just wanted to say thanks to all who offered suggestions. This should keep me well busy until the trip.

[While the BBC have covered this story](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19329758), the main reason (58%) for the drop in Corporation Tax revenues is buried in paragraph 17/24.

Am I the only person who wonders why, given the importance of the oil industry to the UK economy, we rarely hear it mentioned in the MSM. The City, on the other hand, receives daily, in-depth coverage. The more cynical of us might come to the conclusion that it wouldn't really be desirable for us in Scotland to realise  just what a powerful and important industry we have.

Does this story also give a great big clue as to why the London parties are so keen to keep Scotland in the Union **and for no further meaningful devolution to take place**.

I did a [bit of research](http://www.mediachimps.co.uk/blog/item/92-scottish-independence-search-trends-and-speculation) recently that showed that plenty of people were looking online for balanced information regarding the referendum, but were failing to find it - basically because all the sites are pushing an agenda.

So the informational searches were coming up with comics and irrelevant notes etc.

Anyway - long story short, I thought I'd throw together a site to try and provide a neutral source of information, as much as that is possible.

It's over here: [twizz.co.uk](http://www.twizz.co.uk)

The reason I'm posting this in /r/scotland is because, I was hoping you guys might be able to help me out with suggestions for resources and information I can include on there.  I also plan to open the news section to anyone who can write a balanced article on related topics, so if anyone is interested, please let me know.

Anyway - there it is - any feedback or suggestions are very welcome.
Cheers,
Mark

Hopefully this is a good place to spread our message, I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to read my post. I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible.

I work for a greyhound rescue center (Greyhound Rescue Fife) based in Kinross. We currently have many lovely greyhounds that desperately need a warm cosy home to go to and a loving family to be a part of. If you did not know much about the breed, let me sum it up for you: They are very gentle, caring, affectionate and comfort loving dogs. They love being with you and really lobe getting lots of cuddles! In the many dogs I have worked with, not one single greyhound has had a bad bone in its body, they really are fantastic animals.

We take in dogs that have come to the end their racing career and, sadly, would otherwise be destroyed - (some of the dogs can be as young as two to four years old). Obviously we cannot save every dog, but we do the very best we can to save as many as possible.

Obviously I cannot explain everything about us on this page, all of this is explained in much more detail on our website. It would mean so much to me, and everyone else at Greyhound Rescue Fife (and of course all of our beautiful dogs!) if you would take five minutes of your time to take a look around our website. You can find it here:

http://www.greyhoundrescuefife.com/

If you are thinking about getting a dog please consider a retired Greyhound; They need your help! If you require any further info or would like to consider adopting one of our lovely dogs, please let me know, or give Celia and Jimmy a call (The number can be found on our website).

Many thanks, and we hope to hear from you soon!",,False,,t5_2qkli,False,,,True,t3_11r6ap,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/11r6ap/retired_racing_greyhounds_desperately_need_a/,

Press ""Services"" on the remote control (or from the Guide go to ""Options"" on the top menu). 

Press the down arrow, and then scroll across to ""Add Channels"". 

Press ""Select"" or the down arrow, to highlight the frequency. 

Using the number pad on the remote, enter the following frequency: 10.832

Check that the Symbol Rate is 22.0 and that the FEC is 5/6, and adjust if necessary. 

Press the yellow button to Find Channels. 

Once it has finished scanning, find &amp; highlight one of the channels ""ITV1 HD"" (there should be two of them) and press the yellow button to store it, and then press Select to continue.

I plan to also cross-post this to r/novascotia (an even longer shot) and have already contacted my tutor and the College to try to find resources that way.
