This has NOTHING to do with Jax keeping his family close to him.  If his end game was to stay with SAMCRO forever, he wouldn't be looking for outs with Nero and trying to set the club on the right path before he exits.  He has grown and matured, albeit in a dark way, since he got the President patch.  I do believe it'll be hard for him to leave, but you can see that Tara and his kids are very important to him.  As for the ripped up papers, how could you not be upset hearing your wife who you love is taking your kids and forcing you out of the only thing you've ever known before you are ready?

This has EVERYTHING to do with Gemma wanting to keep her family whole and keep her position of power as the female head of SAMCRO.  She did it with JT, and when the power slipped she moved to Clay.  Clay's power has slipped, and now she's doing everything she can to be close to Jax.  Sutter also showed Gemma's resurgence of power when Tara put her in a choke hold at the hospital, and Gemma knocked Tara back into her seat.  Every time Tara has choked someone, they have submitted.  Gemma hit back and won the exchange, which we haven't seen before.  IMO, Tara is on her way out which is going to lead Jax into more instability, and Gemma is going to get close with her family once more regardless of her wrongdoings.

Tara is headed to jail, where that US Marshall has proven he can lurk and get to people.  Once inside, feeling as though she has been wronged by Gemma and Jax, the US Marshall is going to work her to give up information in hopes of rebuilding a RICO case against SAMCRO.  Tara will be offered a deal to ""Give up the Sons, or give up your sons"" which I feel will be a large plot point in next season.  I say this because Jax has been very open with Tara about the club, so she has a ton of ""Present"" information which can be leveraged for her freedom (which Juice once had).  Also, with Clay being framed by Jax and SAMCRO and a price being put on his head, he can take Otto's place as ""History"" in exchange for protection from Pope's people inside.

As many people have said, Sons of Anarchy is a tragedy and we need to give up all hope for any kind of happy ending.  As time goes on, Sutter is going to drive us into hating Jax for becoming what we had always hoped he wouldn't.  He will become a monster, and will destroy everything he loves and holds close because he can't let go of ""This Life"".  I know tons of people have other theories as well, so let's get them started away from the Season Finale Discussion Thread.

TL;DR Gemma is a selfish needy bitch.  Jax will become a monster.  Clay is ""History"" (was Otto), Tara is ""Present"" (was Juice) in new RICO case.

When Tara pleaded with Jax about his responsibility to his sons, there was an instant change in the conversation's tone without any new words needed to be exchanged.

Tara is becoming the Old Lady of ALL Old Ladies; she's the new Queen.

In a 1%'ers world, the hierarchy is as follows:

- CLUB FIRST / Family and EVERYTHING ELSE - SECOND.

When she said ""You have Sons"", she realized this reality and knew that it was Jax's responsibility to put them first (as much as that sucks).

When Tara showed strength and support in the face of this, Jax decided to Marry her. It was his way of making up the fact that she'll always be second to the club -at least at this point in their lives.

Pope had given Jax his demands, among those was ""a dead Son for the Niner and the cop you and your guys killed"". All through that episode I was thinking ""Pope wants Tig to rot in prison, so that leaves Chibs, Opie and Jax. All very major characters, no chance any of them will be killed off, especially 3 episodes into the new season! They'll do what Sons do best and get out of it somehow"". 

I kept waiting for that moment. 

Even just before the big moment, when they're all in the ""viewing room"" and the guard is all ""whose it gonna be?"" all I could think was ""it's gonna be you! Cue awesome rock music and Sons defying Pope!"" Even after Opie headbutted the guard to volunteer himself and he was facing off against the other inmates, I was just waiting for that goddamn moment.

I'm not sure when I realized that moment would never come, but when I did, I remember just staring at the TV, hands clasped on top of my head, in shock.

It's not very often TV catches me off guard. Especially in this day and age where news of a cast member's departure from a show is posted all over the internet, Sutter managed to keep this secret from me. 

The last 5 minutes of the next episode, ""Stolen Huffy"", holy shit. When his coffin arrived at TM, I just thought ""okay, time to say goodbye and move on."" It's not until Bobby places the beanie under Ope's hand, teary eyed, I realize ""ah shit, this is gonna hurt.""

And then ""Jax, it's time, brother"" and that damn song starts. The bottom lip starts to quiver and before you know it, goddamn tears. 

I've had an uncle and a grandparent die in the past year and I never shed a tear for them, but I'm bawling at the death of a fictional character. I'm not sure what kind of monster that makes me, but there it is.

I just finished my first Sons marathon since season 5 ended. I thought time would make it a little less sad to watch. It does not.

Not since Dr Cox killed all those patients in Scrubs (""My Lunch"") has TV evoked such emotion in me. Gemma telling Jax and Clay about the rape rates up there, too.

Some of the best TV I've ever seen, but it sucks so goddamn bad.

During the preview, http://vod.fxnetworks.com/watch/soa/10189891642, they clearly focus on a gun at several points. This is the gun Clay gave Juice, which Juice was hesitant to take at first. If you look closely, this appears to be the gun Jax points at Tig when he is supposed to be giving him to Pope. We already know Pope essentially told Jax how to kill Clay when he was talking about revenge by proxy, but this works both ways. If this is what I think is going on, Jax will kill Pope at the meet with Clay's gun, bringing the hit squad on Clay. Jax can kill two birds with one stone; he ends Pope, and finally gets revenge on Clay. Obviously this is SoA so there is no way it goes that smoothly, but there is potential.

[Spoilers through Ep. 5-10]",bamfsEnnui,67,15,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/13gw4o/dont_underestimate_clay_my_conspiracy_theory/,"If you aren't fully caught up to Season 5 - Episode 10, please do not read this.  It contains many spoilers and I don't want to take the time to black half of it out.  Also, I'm hoping this reads okay, it may jump around a bit and I'm not going to go super deep into each of my theories, just giving an overview.

I've had a slightly different experience with SoA than some of you.  I watched the entire series in less than a month and am finally to the point where I have to wait to catch the episodes weekly.  It took me a while to get into the facets of the different characters and for the longest time, though I hated Clay, I felt that he was simply a product of Gemma's creation.  After the last couple of episodes though, my opinion has changed - a LOT.

I think that Clay is a sociopath who has been able to keep his true intentions and intelligence (or cunning perhaps) under the radar by playing himself down a bit, he's an injured soldier and lets others feel like they have input in the decisions while he puts them out in a way that there isn't much choice.  Though the show seems to show Gemma doing a lot of the manipulations, Clay tends to have his finger in the pot a lot he just does most of his meddling in seemingly smaller things.  He already knows how Gemma will handle the big things, why get more involved when she'll do it anyway and deflect the attention from him?

I think that Clay had been setting up a way for Jax to take over the gavel for quite some time.  He's been using his hands to slowly show weakness, getting him prepared for the inevitable.  Then again, when he was able to be off of his O2, he kept playing more injured than he needed to be.  When Gemma wasn't there to administer his shots, he quit using the cortisone treatment in his hands.  Sure, there have been times when he's lost the ability to ride due to his hands, but a few seemed to have been for dramatic purposes on his part and in other cases, they turned out to conveniently work in his favor - Frankie Diamonds for example.  Not to say that there isn't something actually wrong with his hands, but could he perhaps be exaggerating it a bit to portray himself as less of a threat than he already is?

Why would he want Jax to take up the gavel before he absolutely needed to?  To see if he would run the club the way Clay wanted it done.  To test his loyalties.  When he saw that Jax was headed in a different direction than where he wanted him to be going with things as his VP, he put the MC into an impossible situation with the cartel.  I don't for a moment believe that he underestimated the amount of shit that would be hitting the fan when he signed on with Romeo.  The only thing he was missing was the the CIA involvement.  Clay has made sure that he stays in the club regardless by cementing his connection with the IRA.

Every order Clay issued when President outside of general business such as runs seemed to be a test of faith.  Tig was probably already a psychopath before Clay's influence, but Clay played on him repeatedly testing his loyalty and putting him into positions that would change him in the eyes of the rest of the club, making the only one who was completely comfortable around him be Clay himself.  Then he starts shutting out Tig and Bobby.  I think this also was calculated to play into him turning over the lead to Jax.  The only thing that he wasn't counting on was Tig's reaction when he assaulted Gemma.

Of course, he didn't count on getting shot being the reason that he lost his President title.  But he knew Opie would come seeking revenge.  I think it was another test of loyalty, this time on Jax, to see if he would save him.  He may have been betting heavy on that one, but he knew Jax would at least stop Opie from killing him if only for Opie's own sake.

On to Gemma...  I don't think he really loves her.  I don't think he is capable of love.  She was the Queen of the club and he wanted the club.  She is a convenience to him.  She handles a lot of his dirty work, maintains the ties with Unser that he needs and keeps his secrets for him.  When even she started questioning him, he lost it and beat her half to death.  I think that's about the only time he actually lost control, but I don't think his remorse was from hurting a woman that he loved, it was in simply that loss of control in a way that the whole club saw.  It's implied that Gemma has something to hide as well concerning JT's death, and Clay promises to never reveal it.  I question what she believes she is responsible for versus what actually happened and how much of a hold it gave him over her from the beginning.

When he and Gemma split, he wasn't really the least bit concerned about Unser spending the amount of time with her that he had been.  Unser is already under his thumb.  He also didn't really care what may have happened to her when he sent the Nomads in to steal the safe.  He became interested in her faithfulness only when she started hooking up with Nero, and I think that's because he's worried that she may finally start giving up his secrets.  His weak plays at getting her back are like tempting her with a kicked dog.  My guess as to the contents of the legal documents in the safe - deeds to T&amp;M as well as life-insurance policies and wills that he doesn't want changed.

Over the years members of the First Nine have been dropping off, a decent amount of them at the hands of Clay or under suspicious circumstances.  They seem to have been getting in his way.  He's eliminating the past.  I don't know if something happened between him and JT that caused this need for him to rule the club to begin with, but either he wanted desperately to take it from JT, or something in the club sparked him to need to take it over and have it for himself.  It's not the brotherhood for him, it's the power over the members.

He has a knack of putting a spin on every piece of information that is discovered about him that would set him in a bad light.  Admitting that he put the hit out on Opie that resulted in Donna's death and killing Piney for example.  Because he admitted it, with seeming remorse and humility rather than letting it come out from someone else made it easier for the MC to accept it and, if nothing else, take it off the table for a while.

He also is able to quickly take any new piece of the puzzle that he finds out has been hidden from him and put it to good use.  He needs new people to be on his side, he's given Juice as someone to look over him while he recovers.  He starts sucking him in, sees his weakness and turns into a shoulder for him to cry on.  As soon as he learns about the RICO case, he tosses Juice a bone to keep him quiet about both of their secrets and heads out to Lenny to get more info.  No sooner does he get the scoop on Otto then he has a meeting with Romeo setting up Jax.  He's figured out that Romeo is protected somehow, he also knows exactly what Romeo is capable of.  He uses some BS ""I can start another group to keep the guns..."" excuse to get Romeo to eliminate Jax and put him back in charge of the club.  There's no way he could take back the gavel at this point without that type of assistance.  Jax has made too many ties with people like Pope and is in the process of making the club more legit than Clay would like it to be.  The Prince has proven himself to not be going in Clay's direction, it's time for him to be dethroned.

With Clay back in charge, IRA and cartel business will be as usual, and he can keep the association that Jax built with Pope to continue the added income from the drugs.  As far as the other clubs go, anything positive that happened between them via Jax can be kept, anything bad, such as the GB incident, can be blamed entirely on Jax.  He's already shown that he doesn't give a damn about Tara, and just now that he's willing to sacrifice Jax.  If he gets rid of both of them, most of the evidence against him regarding JT's death goes away except for Gemma and Unser who are both also involved somehow.

Now, I don't necessarily believe he can pull off everything that he wants to accomplish, there are still some factors in play that he doesn't know about or are out of his hands, but I think he's been orchestrating much more behind the scenes than the viewers are supposed to realize.  These are just my thoughts on how viscous of a bastard he **really** is.

Quick side note - I may be overstating Tig's psychopathic tendencies.  He actually does have feelings and shows remorse.  I just don't know how exactly to diagnose him as I am not a professional.  But with Clay, I think all of his 'emotions' are studied and emulated rather than sincere.

Anyways, this is my theory, what do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2rbpl,False,,,True,t3_13gw4o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/13gw4o/dont_underestimate_clay_my_conspiracy_theory/,

I had never have much thought into watching this show. 

I knew of SoA, since it first started, but I never cared to watch it. I thought: ""It's a show about a biker gang. Pass."" 

Long story short, in the last few months I've decided to watch shows I had prejudicially written off as shows I just wouldn't like.

But then I decided one night, while looking for something to watch on Netflix,  to watch Breaking Bad. Well, I was hooked and watched the entire series (combo of Netflix and torrent) within three days. I should add, when I get weekends off, I sometimes have tv show marathons. 

So I watched BrBd, and thoroughly loved it. LOVED IT!

Then a month later I watched all three seasons of Justified. Another great show I never cared to think of watching.

Then on Friday I decided to watch a series. I picked SoA.

My word. It was amazing. The story telling, acting, character development, music, the women, it is all high quality.

I laughed. I cried. I sat on the edge of nervous anticipation. 

You know the writing and acting is stellar when you passionately want a character to die (Stahl). lol

It's a show that had me thinking one thing and the n completely threw me for a curve.

Sorry for the essay here, but I just wanted to let whoever reads this, that I love this show.

Thanks!

**State of the Subreddit**

* We've had some awesome growth in membership over the past 10 months. We had a little over 1,000 subscribers when the Season 4 finale aired and were hoping to have 2,000 by the time Season 5 started. Needless to say, we plowed right through that goal. So good work if you told your friends about us.
* Even with the show off the air, you all did a good job of keeping this subreddit fresh with content. This place ain't nothing without you all, so thanks.

**Discussion threads**

* An official discussion thread will go up one hour before the show airs on the East Coast.
* The only thing we ask is you upvote the discussion thread to ensure as many people as possible see it.
* Inside discussion threads, there's no need to mark spoilers for things occurring in that episode or any episodes up to that point.

**Spoilers**

* Outside of discussion threads, *mark your spoilers.* This goes for both comments and submitted content.
* If you see a spoiler, *report it.* If it's a close call, report it and the mods will figure it out.

Pretty standard stuff.

So welcome to our new members and welcome back to everyone else. Really looking forward to watching another season with some great fans.

He never has anything constructive to say. He just says what others are doing is wrong. Jax asks him for input and he has no ideas. 

1. Clay makes a deal with the Cartel, the club backs it, he doesn't but instead of either getting behind it, or helping come up with a solution out of it he just keeps saying ""I told you so"" over and over again.

2. Jax goes after a GB friend, Bobby is against going at it hard. But all he says is look for another way. Oh thanks a lot, great input there VP. 

3. Keeps saying Clay shouldn't be killed, because he doesn't want Jax to turn into him. First I don't get how that makes any sense. Clay has killed members because of power. Jax wants him dead for legit reasons. Clay killed two members (right there that's his head) put a hit out on the wife of a member, put a hit on a member that got his wife killed. How is this anywhere near what Jax is doing? Even still he doesn't give Jax any guidance on where the club should go and how to get there. 

4. Makes a hissy fit and gives up his VP patch because Jax finds a smarter way to kill Clay. 

So how is he the ""moral voice of the club"" or the only honorable one? Maybe he's honorable because he doesn't do shit, and he's the moral voice because all he does is say what others are doing is wrong. Compare this to when Jax had the VP patch. 

1. Came up with legit ways to earn (porn)
2. Came up with a way to deal with Zobel when Clay came to him. 
3. Put the club before his own personal feelings by letting Clay live (something it seems Bobby is incapable of doing).
4. Saved Leroy and the Niners from getting killed by Galindo thus protecting the MCs rep. 

There are many other times that Jax has stepped up with the VP patch, small things, but still more than what Bobby has done. 

Bobby is the worst VP I've seen, dude does nothing but bitch and complain. Jax had the right of it in season four. He either needs to get behind the club or turn in his goddamn patch! Not just the VP but the entire kut.

----

Also, I'd like to take this chance to firm up the spoiler policy for discussion threads:

In short, don't worry about using spoiler tags in discussion threads if you're discussing things that happened in that episode.

There are only two exceptions that I think are reasonable:

- If you reference spoilers from another show, please mark them (*e.g.,* If a *Sons* character previously appeared on *The Shield* and you want to talk about his fate on *The Shield*, mark it as spoiler).
- If you're referencing something that appeared during the clips for ""On next week's *Sons of Anarchy*..."", mark it as spoiler.  It hasn't been a big problem, from what I've noticed, but not everybody watches those clips and shows have a tendency to put big, juicy plot points in there.  They're not verboten, they just need a spoiler warning.

This doesn't change spoiler rules elsewhere.  This is only for discussion threads.  As always, don't put spoilers in titles and mark spoilers in comments for non-discussion threads.

Clay was finally revealed to be the guy behind the Nomads doing the home invasions. We all knew that was well on the way, my only question is what now?

As far as Tara and Otto, I say that bitch is going to ""s"" some ""d,"" but Otto is not going to give up shit afterwards, going to leave Tara feeling like a major whore. Because that's what I would do.

The Nomads situation, we don't know that the club is going to figure out that it's Clay. I bet Clay kills them all and makes it look like he figured it out that it was them, blah blah blah, makes up another fable that saves his ass. Juice will somehow figure it out that Clay was behind it all and feel conflicted if he should tell Jax or not. Ultimately, he won't and it will drag on until Clay finds his next deadly game.

Another prediction is that Jax is finding out a way that he can kill Pope. He doesn't want anyone else but him thinking about it. The shit will happen, maybe not this season or the next, but it will. 

Unser is dead. Very dead.

""Forever Young"" by Audra Mae, from the S1 Sleep Of Babies episode (in the beginning and then again at the end without the instrumentals, so haunting...), and ""Mary"" by Patty Griffin, from the S2 episode ""Balm"".

They were annoyed in season one when their guns were delayed, but they didn't do anything rash about it. When Piney showed up at their clubhouse and started throwing around the N-word, they let Jax settle things down instead of just straight-up murdering a belligerent old racist who was literally mad at them for no good reason.

They linked up with a rival cartel not out of malice, but because their arm was twisted, and they had no idea that SAMCRO had anything going on with Galindo. They were nearly executed by Galindo, and after being forced to  *assist* the guys who almost killed them, they were targeted by the other cartel, and received NONE of the protection that SAMCRO did. They've provided support to the club in the past, and how have they been repaid?

- Whenever SAMCRO wants to hush up a crime, they blame it on a black guy (which, in turn, makes people suspect the Niners)

- Clay would have gladly watched Galindo execute them for no reason.

- SAMCRO has been forming an alliance with the Niner's main competition, The Mayans, for about 3 seasons now.

- SAMCRO literally chose the Mayans (who have been enemies of both the Niners and SAMCRO for decades) over the Niners, when push came to shove.

- Tig just murdered LeRoy's girlfriend/wife for no reason, with no evidence, for something that LeRoy didn't do.

As has been discussed on this subreddit a billion times, Sons of Anarchy has a lot of Hamlet nuances &amp; influence to it. Did anyone else catch themselves comparing Tara to Ophelia, especially during Seasons Four and Five? It really felt like at certain points Tara was losing her grip on reality (one scene in particular [when Tara intentionally woke baby Thomas by stomping around on his toys, just to comfort him](/spoiler) came to my mind). It made me think a lot about how Ophelia went crazy - once her life fell apart, the deaths of those she loved most, which for Tara I guess you could sort of compare to [her hand getting smashed &amp; nearly tanking her surgical career](/spoiler) - and wound up killing herself. I have found myself wondering if that is what will end up happening with Tara, too, especially now that [her entire life is at stake, after being arrested for murder conspiracy charges](/spoiler).

I know Kurt Sutter has talked a lot about the parallelism of Tara &amp; Gemma, and how Tara is trying to avoid becoming her. So I really wonder if that will also play into Tara's ""madness"".

He is the one who took his own like in despair at what the person he loved (albeit platonic bro love) had become. **Ta**ra is paralleling Hora**ti**o. These names aren't as close, but if you take into account that Tio is a common nickname for Horatio, then they get a little closer (Tara/Tio).

Horatio is Hamlets best friend and number one confidant. This lines up, as Jax has been much more honest about his various plots with Tara then anyone else... For example, he even told her about asking his mom to basically whore herself out to a man who had previously beaten her as atonement for driving his kids high. Horatio is also the one who alerts Hamlet to the presence of the ghost that tells Hamlet that **Cla**udius (**Cla**y) killed his father. This lines up with Tara giving Jax the letters that contained the same information. 

Now onward.... If Sutter sticks to the script, so to speak, we will see **Ge**mma (**Ge**rtrude) taken down in the crossfire between Jax and Clay as they become obsessed with killing each other. Tara, stricken with grief over the whole affair and the fact that everyone is dead, should attempt to take her own life, but chose not to because Jax admonishes her, from his death bed, to continue on and lead his people. In the play, this is of course Denmark. In the show, I am guessing rather then leading the gang she will take care of the children. So, she should outlive everyone. I think we are kind of set up for this. She is really the only one who has the means to move away and start a new life.

So why not speculate about which characters he won't be killing off until the final few episodes.  Remembering that he is borrowing a lot from Hamlet, which means that we can get a few hints from that.

1.  Jax, will live until close to the end.
2.  Clay will live, until close to the end.
3.  Gemma will live, until close to the end.

Bobby, and Chibbs are needed till close to the end (embodiment of the Club).

I am very much on the fence about Tara, though if she is a character close to Ophelia (being driven mad by what happens all around her) the ending will not be happy for her, and if memory serves Ophelia dies a decent interval before the end...  (hmm, that might weaken Jax enough for Clay to make a power grab...)


So possibly soon to be redundant characters (IMO) are:

Juice,  (obviously there is a story arc that will come into play here)
Unser, (he is already on borrowed time, between the cancer and Clay...)
I would think the character of Happy might become redundant, but he could well be the only one to survive the story...
Tig, he will flame out, in a heroic manner which ultimately saves the club and redeems himself.

SO i thought i'd spread some karma (real kind) and send it to one of you fine people.

SPECS: it's the XL, and not only is it large, it's long. so be prepared for that. all tags are still on it and it has never been worn. 

I'M PAYING FOR POSTAGE, so please don't be from outside the US  (unless you want to pay postage)

reply here! first one gets it! if there is some reason why it doesn't go to the first, i'll message the second, and so forth.

It was mentioned in various threads that it was the former Nomad charter members that roughed up Unser.  We could see that clearly from Greg the Peg's foot.  But I've heard different theories on who was behind it including the Niners and the Irish.  So this is what I came up with, while pondering it in the shower:

The Nomads would know that Clay wasn't in the house, because he's been staying at the clubhouse since he got out of the hospital, so the hit wasn't meant for him.  Nobody would have any reason to know that Unser was there, so the hit was certainly meant for Gemma.

The only person with motive to hurt Gemma is Clay, because at this point it's kill or be killed.  He knows he's a dead man either way at this point, but she has crossed a line, and I think launching a sneak attack on her is right up his alley.  Of course knowing Clay, he could have another motive.  He might even be trying to frame the Mayans or the Irish to sabotage the deal that Jax is suddenly so dead set on completing.

Anyway, just some musings.

",MrDoe,34,8,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/14e5za/the_finale_and_tara_spoilers_naturally/,"After looking at the discussion on IMDB, it struck me that the timeline between the arrest of Tara and Gemma's threat seems somewhat unreasonable. Yet it seems that everyone is completely buying the story that Gemma set up Tara. Well, I don't.  
 
Gemma went to threaten Tara at, say, noon-ish. I don't think that Gemma went to the cops right after their talk. What would be the point in threatening her at all, if that was her plan? It's nothing new that Tara is just as bullheaded as Gemma, I doubt that what Tara said startled Gemma enough to have her go right to the cops.  
 
So, if Gemma didn't go to the cops right then, when and why did she go to the cops?  
 
There's a chance that Gemma went along and told the cops after Clay was arrested, but I don't see a reason why she would tell them then. She didn't have more reason to tell them than she did right after talking to Tara.  
 
Now, the last chance, where she did get a reason to actually rat out Tara. When Jax and Nero had their final talk. Gemma now knows that Jax is planning on getting out, but Jax will obviously not want to get out without Tara. Some people say this is when Gemma went to the cops. But, looking at the time, it just doesn't add up. Jax presumably went home after talking to Nero, with the police close behind, and with Gemma after the police. Where did Gemma find the time to tell the police, and where did the police get the time to go from this to getting a warrant and then making the actual arrest? Assuming that going from ""new information"" to a warrant takes an hour, which to me seems entirely reasonable and even optimistic, and then assuming that the cops took an hour to to from the warrant to the arrest itself, it just doesn't add up. Does it really take over two hours to drive from Nero's house of love to Jax and Tara's house? I don't think so.  
 
So, what do you all think? I'm putting my money on someone else than Gemma giving Tara up.

I remember when I was about 8-10 I got a new puppy cockerspaniel and I was playing with it in the front yard when a few of the 'Angels showed up.

My 'uncle' and his friends proceed to tell me how they like to let puppies loose on this track in their 'clubhouse' and then they'd take shots at it with their pistols.  I thought he was trying to scare me but my Dad confirmed that they weren't joking.


In the show they kinda hint at the darker aspects of these guys (Tig is probably neck-deep in cold pussy right now) but really they could never show how it really is.

I'd personally love to see the SOA go visit one of their support clubs (like in ""Patchover"") and instead find them to be the depraved animals that many 1%ers are.

It would be a nice juxtaposition, but it might also undermine the show's 'grit'

edit- I just asked my dad about that again, and now some 20 years later he is laughing his ass off....It would appear as if I am pretty easy to trick.  Guess they were just trying to fuck with me, for now obvious reasons.

In [this piece]( http://tvline.com/2012/12/04/sons-of-anarchy-season-5-finale-spoilers-kurt-sutter/) from TV Line, Sutter said the following, 


"" TVLINE | Just to confirm: Tara’s arrest was the result of Gemma making good on her promise to rat her out?


[Sutter] My intention was to definitely put that out there as a possibility, and I think we’ll reveal how that happened. I do want the audience coming away with, “Wow, did she actually follow through on that threat? And what does that mean for Gemma and Jax if he finds out?” I definitely wanted to create that discussion.""

There you have it. 
Every piece I've found where it is said that Gemma betrayed Tara is never using  quotes, nor saying that he said this. These pieces were editorializing. 

He wants us to discuss this, I've enjoyed discussing this with you, but unfortunately, unsourced myth can easily become a kind of conversation stopper. 
I'm totally down to debate the liklihood or improbablility of this scenario but you can't make a case just by saying you know he said it and the link's around here somewhere.


Example of a case being made:

All that stuff about her being a cockroach, and climbing her way back to the top and getting her balls back, that, is relevant material, but that doesn't automatically mean that she did **a** because **b**.  

On the one hand she hates Tara, and doesn't want Jax to lose his boys. But she's also an old school outlaw personality who never goes to the cops (uncer doesn't count since he's been a bag man forever). She could very well be a red herring Sutter's given us to throw us off of Toric.

Thank you.

What if Clay actually is Jax's bio-dad bc he was having sex with Gemma behind JT's back. so in addition to JT trying to get them out of guns, another reason those two conspired to kill him was to hide who really knocked up Gemma bc cheating with someone's old lady (no prison clause) would cause the club to take Clay's patch. They killed JT to keep their family and club together and keep the gun money coming in. 

Also, Piney and Opie knew. I say Opie bc in season 2 when the Sons were at the ammo native american reservation, Opie told clay that Jax reminded him of his old man. Clay said something like ""yeah JT was stubborn"" and Opie replied ""I meant you"". Piney would have had to obviously told this to Opie.

My thoughts.,scooter1265,30,5,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/112568/new_here_just_got_caught_up_to_the_current_season/,"Well, I usually watch some Netflix before I go to bed, and I've seen Sons of Anarchy in the suggestions for far too long. I figured I would give it a shot, and I'm so glad that I did.

Before I watched this show, I watched Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Hell on Wheels, and Top Gear. I watched all seven seasons of Rescue Me on Netflix, and I thought it was a pretty good show. I knew Sons of Anarchy was a pretty rough show, but I wasn't too sure I would like it. I mean, it's so different than who I am but yet it's still easy to relate to.

So I watched the first season and was hooked. After a three week binge, I'm finally all caught up. This is such a great show, combining great drama with excellent violence, and the suspense of Season 4 had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I haven't felt this kind of excitement for a TV show since Breaking Bad. It really is a great show.

I've also got some of my other friends hooked on it as well, so heres to getting a couple more Nomads here in the future.",,False,self,t5_2rbpl,False,,,True,t3_112568,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/112568/new_here_just_got_caught_up_to_the_current_season/,

I don't know how to get in touch with him(except for twitter which I dislike).
So here is my Idea for the game.

Sons of Anarchy would lend itself well to a Mass Effect 2 style of gameplay. For all the shoot outs and chases there are a lot of dialogue moments that would fit well with that style of gameplay. This would have to take place as a prequel I think. Just so all the characters are in good working order. You would play as one of the batch of prospects before Halfsac was around. You've got gun running, rival gangs police on your ass and a power struggle between Jax and Clay(why not?). You could be lured as a spy for the police or a rival gang or stay true to your SAMCRO brothers. You could set up porn studios, sell drugs(on the side try not to get caught by Jax). 

I'm not sure if it needs to be open world necessarily. But I would like to see opportunity for lots of choice. All of the SOA characters are very different from each other yet they find common ground in the Sons. I want that to come across in the game. Your character is different due to the choices in the game. You would have to do what you could to make due. If that means making a deal to save your family or what have you.

A quick recap:

1. Opie said ""I Got This"" before he went into the box to be killed
2. Jax said ""I Got This"" before he killed the guard with the snow globe
3. Chibbs said ""I Got This"" before he shot the black guy that killed Oped with the pipe

The only one left who was there is now Tig.  How do you guys think it plays out, especially with the last episode being called ""J'ai Obtenu Cette"", which translates to ""I Got This"" from French.

Anyone have predictions for Season 6? 

Jax - Will apparently go to some ""dark places"", I'd be interested to see if he exacts revenge on Juice for ratting, Bobby for going against him and dealing with Clay behind his back, and obviously Gemma, for being a total bitch.

Chibs - I've seen he will become VP, would like his wife and daughter to return. 

Bobby - I think will leave SAMCRO. He was such a thorn in Jax's side the last few episodes I wouldn't be surprised if he's voted out unless he changes his ways. 

Tig - will stay, coming so close to death so many times before, he's like a cockroach. 

Clay - will try from inside to get revenge on Jax, probably using his IRA connections to try and fuck Jax up.

Gemma - to be honest, I'd like to see her go. Hopefully Jax finds out about her blackmailing Tara. (Was it her who got her arrested at the end of season 5 by chance?)

Nero - He's gotta go soon, all the shit he's caught up in will come around to bite him.

Juice - As much as I hope he stays, I can't say I still enjoy his moist-eyed scenes, and I doubt Jax will forget his betrayal. Also, he tried to help Clay just before he was arrested further going against Jax. His days are numbered in my opinion. 

Tara - I think she'll take some shit in prison and try her best to get out and away from Charming. Maybe she'll finally realise Jax isn't worth all of this.

All in all, I see Jax slowly turning into Clay, rather than JT. He's been getting increasingly brutal, and constantly saying how the ""gavel corrupts"". I can see him killing members, hurting Tara, hurting his Mom, etc. Be interesting to see how the show ends!

When Jax killed the guard he said ""I got this"" when chibbs killed the guy last night he said ""I got this.""  Jax also had a heart to heart with chibbs last night saying something like ""I need to know you're gonig to be with me things are going to get much bloodier.""  With what Jax knows how are things going to get much bloodier, he's planning on taking out Clay with the club making the decision which cannot be that bloody, if or when he is done with Juice thats not going to be so bloody as well.  It made me come to a conclusion that Jax is only appearing to be so friendly with Pope to have Tig's moment of ""I got this"" and kill Pope.  I really do not see Jax turning over one of his club members and killing Pope would start off a very very bloody war.  
What does anybody else think? I have no idea currently how Tara is going to get by without assiting in murder charges.

I also did not watch the previews to next weeks episode, those always feel more like spoilers to me, I know I am wierd.

One of the commenters mentioned that the homeless girl that was in the alley outside the dog fighting ring is the same girl that Jax saw in the cemetery in season 1 and has appeared at other points in the series (panhandling Gemma, in the park when Tara was attacked). Now normally I would write those occurrences off as coincidence, or perhaps the actress being a non speaking favorite (the wife/daughter/significant other of someone involved in the production). 

However, tonight she and Jax seemed to share a moment in the alleyway, which makes me think there is more to her than being a recycled actress

Has anyone else noticed this?

Does anyone have any theories as to her significance?

So, here are a few of your guesses.


* At the beginning, we have 3 Nomads at the table. 1 has a peg leg, and says 'It's nice to have a place to put your feet up' and puts his fake leg with a Etnies shoe on Bobby's shoulder (I believe it was Bobby). When Happy was asked who would just randomly raid/trash/vandalize a cargo truck on the highway in the middle of the night, Happy answered with 'Angry Pirates?'. At the end of the episode, Uncer is talking to a bird then he gets beat up/vandalized by THREE guys, one with a Peg Leg. The Peg Leg guy was getting his BIRD. He was an Angry Pirate!

* Clay is becoming Piney. As you can see, Clay now has an oxygen tank, just like Piney. At the end of the episode, we see Clay try to get on his bike, but he can't balance/hold it up. We also see Opie put Piney's trike up for sale. Many have guessed that Clay will buy Piney's bike and ride it, further becoming Piney.

* Many have also guessed that Nero knows of the SOA. Many have also guessed that he is affiliated with the Mayans. Many have also guesses that he put drugs in Gemma's drink at the bar,  just so he can hook up with Gemma and set up a meeting with her/SOA.

So, I wanted to share some opinions and observations I had about Tara and  see what you Outlaws had to say about it. 

I think Tara is going to lose her shit in Season 5. Not to put any fancy technical term to it, but she's losing her mind. I mean, she's been in a constant state of flux since Season 1, and she's never been happy, truly happy, for any appreciable amount of time. We always knew that would be a point of conflict for Jax, Gemma and the club. 

However, at the end of Season 4, she really started to creep me out after she smashed her hand. I mean, the self-inflicted smashing of her hand when Wendy showed up (Another wild card that bitch is!) and then in the last couple of episodes asking Jax and Gemma: ""Tell me you love me"" with that creepy vacant look in her eyes. It was spooky. Then, sobbing, saying over and over 'he's mine' at the very end of the Season 4 finale. 

And now, this volatile, unbalanced woman knows the secret that can bring down the whole club. I think Tara loses her shit in Season 5 and does something incredibly stupid. 

What if she told the Irish Kings about the CIA? I mean, look at it from her point of view. She finds a way to kill that deal, then yes, Jax will go to prison. For awhile. BUT.....the entire SOA worldwide gets taken down by the feds. When Jax gets out, he'll have nothing left but her. 

Just a thought. What do you guys think? ",,False,self,t5_2rbpl,1343430800.0,,patch,True,t3_x6iya,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/x6iya/tara_the_season_5_wild_card_season_4_spoilers/,

C'mon guys.

Remember season one? Remember who was tugging Clay's leash? Who was most worried about Jax reading JT's diary and moving away from gun running? It was Gemma. She's been manipulating everyone she interacts with on the show from episode one. I'll grant that she likes Tara a lot, and cares deeply about her grandchildren, but I'm not buying into the line she's giving Unser and Tara about her (relative) innocence regarding JT's murder and the direction of the club.

There's Juice: there's no way that Jax or the club (when they find out) will allow Juice to live considering he gave up the club and murdered a patched-in member to boot. There's also Otto, who's going to die in prison at some point. Finally, there's Jax himself, who seems like he still wants out from the club and the danger, which wouldn't kill him but would remove him as a member of the club.

Why the hell is Tara a surgeon? This is 4 years of undergrad + 4 years of med school + a minimum 4-6 year residency we're talking about. 

And surgeon residencies are BRUTAL. The kind of career that people dedicate their lives and almost all their waking hours to. Not getting involved with fringe nonsense like fighting biker whores and getting chased down by gang members. 

More so, understand that surgeon's make $$$ BANK.

Sure Jax loves his club and all, but lets be real. If they really gave a shit about their kids they should just move away. Its not a matter of money, hell Tara should be easily pulling 6+ figures and is basically set for a very comfortable life with her family.

Ok...here goes.

The show isn't about Jax, its about Gemma. It's her show, her town and her club. Everyone and everything that Gemma cares about and loves, she is going to have to watch it fall apart and die until there is nothing left but her. I feel that the endgame will be Gemma having to watch everyone die (including Jax, Tara and the kids) and it will of course be from Clay's hand and she will finally be the one that takes Clay's life. In the end, she will be all alone and everyone will be dead and gone then Gemma will finally take her own life.
